<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>25. What is FRC's position on the United Nations' Convention
on the Rights of the Child?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child
poses threats to the institution of the family.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> No U.S. ratification of the U.N. Convention
on the Rights of the Child.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> The United Nations was created
in 1945 in the shadow of the Second World War as an attempt by
the victorious democracies to establish an international body
to safeguard the peace and promote human rights.  The U.N. has
attempted to give voice to the common aspirations of the world's
people.  In the past two decades, however, the U.N. has expanded
its agenda in ways that pose direct threats to the traditional
family.

<p>

Among the most threatening is the U.N. Convention of the Rights
of the Child, which was approved by the U.N. General Assembly
in 1989.  One prominent theme from the Convention is the notion
that children ought to be protected from the power of their parents.
Several articles in the Convention grant children new rights
independent of their parents and families.  In the U.S. today,
children's rights are, in effect, held in trust by their parents.
Under the Convention, children would hold those rights themselves.
For example, Article 12 grants children &quot;the right to express
views freely in all matters.&quot;  Would Article 12 permit parents
to restrict their children from getting tattoos, or talking back
to authority figures?  Article 15 guarantees children the &quot;freedom
of association.&quot;  One can envision a law that prevents parents
from restricting a child's choice of friends.  Conceivably, Article
14's freedom of religion could prevent a parent from taking a
child to church when he would rather not go.  Under Article 13,
a child has the right &quot;to seek, receive, and impart information.&quot;
There are no exceptions to this right, not even for parents who
would like to keep pornography from their children.

<p>

The U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Madeleine Albright, signed the
treaty in 1995, and it will become law in this country if the
Senate ratifies it by a two-thirds vote.  The required vote in
the Senate does not seem likely now, because Sen. Jesse Helms
(R-N.C.), a strong opponent of the Convention, is chairman of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which must review it.
In fact, Sen. Helms has introduced a Senate Resolution which
expresses the sense of the Senate that &quot;the primary safeguard
for the well-being and protection of children is the family, and
that, because the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the
Child could undermine the rights of the family, the President
should not sign and transmit it to the Senate.&quot;  Twenty-three
Senators have co-sponsored this resolution.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> As an international treaty, the U.N. Convention
on the Rights of the Child would be co-equal with federal statutes,
and possibly the United States Constitution.  If the United States
were to ratify the treaty as it stands, it would become not only
an international obligation, but also a domestic obligation potentially
regulating the most intimate details of American family life.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>26. Does FRC support the adoption of a $500 per child tax
credit for every American family with children?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC supports the adoption of a $500 per child tax credit for every
American family with children.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> FRC has been calling on Congress
to adopt pro-family tax relief for many years.  Today, the average
family of four contributes nearly 25 cents on every dollar in
income taxes and payroll taxes to the U.S. government -- this
is compared to two cents on every dollar in 1950.  In light of
this, the per child tax credit was designed to help offset the
extraordinary erosion in per child income tax benefits over the
last half-century.  Passage of significant pro-child tax relief
should be a top priority in the ensuing debate in Congress and
in the presidential debates.  The $500 per child tax credit was
vetoed by President Clinton as part of the balanced budget package.
FRC believes that per child tax relief should be the centerpiece
of any tax reform package.

<p>

Many critics and lukewarm supporters have expressed concern about
offsetting the revenues lost to such tax cuts.  In recent years,
the Heritage Foundation and others have developed ways to offset
generous pro-family tax relief with significant cuts in federal
spending programs.  These proposals have considerable merit --
as do proposals which would seek to offset the &quot;cost&quot;
of pro-family tax relief over the long haul by raising the retirement
age for various federal entitlement programs.

<p>

Streamlining government and permitting families to keep more of
their own income -- for things like dental appointments and clothing
purchases and electric bills -- benefits both the national economy
and the personal economy of families.  Immediate pro-family tax
relief should be a part of any government plan to balance the
budget and make government more efficient.  Of course, pro-family
tax relief also sends to families the message that their dedication
to their children is invaluable to America, as they are the next
generation of American citizens.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Tax relief for families with children will strengthen
the American home and its finances, place real limits on the growth
of government and its wrongheaded attempts to redirect family
life, and underscore that the best &quot;investment&quot; in children
is made by mothers and fathers who, indeed, &quot;know best.&quot;

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<center><h2>27. Does FRC support welfare reform?  Why?</h2></center>

<p>

To control the damage caused by federal welfare programs that
promote family breakdown and crowd out more compassionate alternatives
at the grass-roots (including private, faith-based programs),
FRC supports compassionate welfare reform.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> End the entitlement status of all cash
benefits that reward irresponsible conduct, particularly benefits
that are contingent on the birth of a child outside marriage;
end the federal tax code's marriage penalty on low- and middle-income
taxpayers; end the federal role in welfare -- both funding and
programmatic responsibility -- to maximize states' flexibility
to experiment with anti-poverty efforts that impose behavioral
requirements; revise the tax code to encourage charitable giving.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> The current welfare system encourages
family disintegration and discourages personal responsibility
by guaranteeing a right to cash benefits regardless of personal
conduct.  The bureaucratic arrangements that spring up to administer
those benefits, in turn, tend to crowd out the voluntary organizations
that provide the real help -- the help that changes lives.

<p>

The culture of welfare dependency has reduced a potentially proud
and independent people to passive clients.  The current system
sends the message not that they are equal to the inevitable challenges
of life, but that they are helpless -- a different, less capable
group of citizens than those who can and do live by the rules.
Welfare bureaucrats say, &quot;You can't do this.  Let us do
it for you.  And pay us to do it with your vote, year after year.&quot;
Current policy empowers the bureaucracy at the same time it destroys
individuals, and children are inheriting not only material poverty
but their parents' poverty of the spirit.

<p>

It is not enough to say that certain kinds of welfare reform will
cause suffering.  Policymakers must come to terms with the degree
of suffering that is occurring now.  No one can expect to roll
back the tide until more children are growing up with an attentive
father in the home.  The overriding purpose of welfare reform
<I>must</I> be to reverse government policies that suppress the
natural human instinct to form families.

<p>

Policymakers can disapprove of personal decisions that jeopardize
children and yet still provide help.  Measures like the tax credit
for charitable contributions deserve support because the most
compassionate help comes from private individuals and organizations
that sponsor moral renewal at the same time they offer material
support -- on the premise that needy individuals are not clients
but fellow human beings.  Welfare policy should in no way jeopardize
the autonomy of the faith-based programs that have a proven track
record of rescuing lives when all other programs have failed.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Compassionate welfare reform will ensure that
more children have the opportunity to reap the benefits of stable,
two-parent families.  It will expand the freedom of individuals
to make rational, responsible decisions by eliminating the perverse
economic incentives of the current welfare system.  It will also
redirect dollars to those organizations that provide not only
material help but also love, concern, and an opportunity for personal
renewal.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>28. Does FRC support exemptions for women in 
combat?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC fully supports the armed forces exemption of women from combat
and near-combat assignments.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> Re-impose combat exemptions for women and
reverse decisions to dramatically increase the number of women
serving.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> In the National Defense Authorization
Act for Fiscal Years 1992 and 1993, Congress rescinded female
combat exemption laws and then the Clinton administration opened
a quarter million previously closed combat and near-combat positions
to women.  These decisions were not prompted by military necessity,
and they hinder military readiness.

<p>

According to the 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment
of Women in the Armed Forces, there are undeniable differences
in speed, strength and endurance between men and women.  Women
will always be in greater danger on the battlefield.  Women do
not have &quot;an equal opportunity to survive.&quot;  That's
why the most physically demanding combat assignments should go
to men.  Additionally, a downsizing military does not need women
when an ample pool of fully-qualified men is available.

<p>

Assigning women to combat also makes women vulnerable to a future
draft.  The 1948 Selective Service Act requires all 18-year-old
male citizens to register for a possible draft.  In the 1981 case
of <I>Rostker v. Goldberg</I>, the Supreme Court ruled that women
were excluded from selective service registration primarily because
the law exists to develop a pool of potential combat troops; women
at that time were not eligible for combat.  That argument is losing
credibility as more combat exemptions are being abandoned.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Removing exemptions for women weakens the military
and makes all women vulnerable to a future draft.

<p>

The military exists to perform the most physically demanding task
known to man: combat.  Removing exemptions so that more women
can serve in combat and near-combat is not a prudent readiness
decision.  It weakens America's combat power.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>29. What is FRC's position on informed consent for women's
reproductive health decisions?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that women have the right to be fully informed about
both immediate and future risks to their physical and emotional
health, especially with regards to induced abortion.

<p>

<b>Actions Needed:</b> (1) Require that all health care professionals,
especially counselors and practitioners working in family planning
clinics and public health departments, effectively communicate
to their patients or &quot;clients&quot; the risks involved in
abortion, e.g., the increased risk of breast cancer for women
who have abortions.  (2) Require that all abortion clinics (as
well as other medical facilities offering abortions) perform an
ultrasound exam on abortion-minded women in order to (a) confirm
pregnancy and (b) to educate the woman about what the abortion
procedure entails. (3) Require post-abortion counseling centers
or other physicians to be integrated within protocol in order
to achieve true informed consent.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> It is routine public health practice
that patients be informed of all their risks before undergoing
a medical procedure or receiving medication of any kind.  However,
while technology has rapidly advanced and more data have been
acquired in the field of women's reproductive health, the abortion
industry and family planning clinics have not been regulated to
the same degree as hospitals and other health care facilities.
As a result, it is dubious that women are truly receiving all
the information they need to make fully informed decisions about
their reproductive health.

<p>

For example, women are currently not advised of the possibility
that induced abortion increases their risk of breast cancer, especially
if they have borne no other children to full term.  And yet, there
are more than 20 epidemiologic studies spanning the last two decades
which show a link between abortion (induced or spontaneous) and
breast cancer.  Indeed, the prestigious <I>Journal of the National
Cancer Institute</I> published a 1994 study which found that women
who have had an abortion before age 18 are 150 percent more likely
to develop breast cancer.  Women who have had an abortion after
age 30 increase their risk of breast cancer by 110 percent, and,
regardless of age, abortion increases the risk of breast cancer
by 50 percent.  With approximately 1.5 million abortions taking
place in the United States every year, 40 percent of which are
repeat abortions, and with one in every nine American women developing
breast cancer in their lifetimes, it is remarkable and highly
unethical that women are not informed of such risks.

<p>

In addition, there is ample evidence to suggest that many women
undergoing abortion suffer from post-abortion grief or trauma.
Indeed, support groups such as Project Rachel and organizations
such as American Victims of Abortion exist because of the emotional
scars post-abortive women bear.  Yet women are not being informed
of their risk of experiencing post-abortion grief nor are referrals
to any of the aforementioned organizations being given as part
of the typical abortion clinic's protocol.

<p>

Furthermore, achieving true informed consent becomes even more
important as several abortion clinics are currently using new
experimental abortifacients, such as the off-label usage of the
anti-cancer drug methotrexate in combination with the prostaglandin
cytotec.  Neither of these drugs is approved for the use of abortion,
yet several abortionists are regularly offering these drugs to
their patients, even though there is little research available
to prove their safety or efficacy.

<p>

Beyond providing appropriate counseling regarding abortion's physical
and emotional risks, abortion clinics should also be required
to give each abortion-minded woman an ultrasound exam in order
to confirm pregnancy and better explain the abortion procedure
to the woman.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Achieving true informed consent will (1) require
abortion clinic counselors to devote more time to each counseling
session, (2) require abortion clinics to purchase ultrasound equipment
and employ staff who are knowledgeable in operating the ultrasound,
(3) require that the most up-to-date research on the safety and
efficacy of abortion techniques, the physical and emotional risks
involved with abortion, and information about post-abortion grief
organizations are available for all clients.  Abortion clinics
will also need to come under the jurisdiction of a medical regulatory
agency in order to make certain that they are adhering to the
standards of true informed consent outlined above.  While these
regulations will require providers of abortion to alter their
practices, the standards are absolutely necessary to achieve the
overriding goal of protecting women's health and giving women
all the information they need to make an informed choice.

<title>What Is Policy Review -- Heritage</title>
<META name="keyword" content="Policy Review: Journal of American Citizenship, community, conservative, journal, families, family, local, civic, religious, schools, education, citizens">
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<img src="/heritage/revpo.gif" width=169 height=79 alt="Policy Review" border=0></a>
<h2><i>POLICY REVIEW: The Journal of American Citizenship</i></h2></center>
<p>
<i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i>, the flagship magazine of <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a>, is published 6 times per year. 
<p>
<i>Policy Review</i> specializes in the study of private-sector and local-government alternatives to the bureaucratic, centralized welfare state. We are dedicated to rebuilding the institutions of American citizenship -- families, neighborhoods, religious institutions, public and private schools, voluntary civic institutions, businesses, and local governments.
<p>
<i>Policy Review</i> profiles great American citizens: Houston constable Victor Trevino is reducing crime with his "zebra squad" of volunteer cops; Sister Connie Driscoll is helping young urban mothers in Chicago; <a href="/heritage/p_review/spring95/tolerth.html">Rev. Frank Reid</a>, of Baltimore's AME Church, is promoting black Christian manhood to the members of his community.
<p>
We study "what works": <a href="/heritage/p_review/spring95/glassth.html">DeVry Institute of Technology</a> sets the standard for career training; Rhode Island's privatized school lunch program tastes better and costs less; private security officers reduce crime around New York's Grand Central Station. 
<p>
We tackle tough subjects, and propose common-sense policy prescriptions, for issues such as <a href="/heritage/p_review/fall95/thegg.html">crime</a>, <a href="/heritage/p_review/summer95/thfost.html">taxes</a>, <a href="/heritage/p_review/fall95/thhood.html">environment</a>, <a href="/heritage/p_review/fall95/thfinn.html">education</a>, <a href="/heritage/p_review/fall95/thsher.html">religion and culture</a>, <a href="/heritage/p_review/summer95/thcraig.htm">adoption and foster care</a>, and <a href="/heritage/p_review/summer95/thbear.html">Social Security</a>. We publish articles by influential people on the major issues of the day. Newt Gingrich, Phil Gramm, <a href="/heritage/p_review/summer95/tharmey.html">Dick Armey</a>, Bill Bennett, Ralph Reed, Bill Kristol, Kate O'Beirne, Grover Norquist, and other key policy makers all contribute to <i>Policy Review</i>.
<p>
<i>Policy Review</i> provides practical, constructive thought -- the best of conservatism-in-action.

<head><title>The Heritage Foundation Internship Program</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">

<h2><center><i>Internship Program</h2><br></i></center>
<b><i><center>1995-96 Information and Application Form</b><br></i>
<hr width=75%><br></center>
<P>
	The Heritage Foundation was founded in 1973 "to formulate and promote conservative public policies based on the principles of free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values, and a strong national defense."   A non-partisan tax-exempt institution, it is now one of the largest and most influential research and educational foundations in the United States, providing national, state, and local decision-makers with information that is concise, timely, and relevant to the current policy debate.<p>

	In the early 1980s Ronald Reagan described Heritage as the "feisty new kid on the block." Today, according to House Speaker Newt Gingrich, "Heritage plays a major role in developing the ideas that are going to make America's success possible in the 21st century."<P>

	Located in the nation's capital, The Heritage Foundation offers both summer and academic year internships.  These programs are intended to introduce bright and innovative undergraduate students to the policy-making process, involve them in the important questions and issues of the day, and encourage them to become active and effective participants in public affairs.<br><center>

<i><h3><center><u>The Heritage Internship Program</h3></center></u><p>


	Internships vary depending on the department to which the participant is assigned.  In general, applicants should possess strong writing abilities, a talent for research, and excellent communication skills.  During the internship program, participants will attend weekly discussion seminars on policy issues and political thought that are designed to augment their day-to-day activities.  In order to further enrich the internship experience, program participants are invited and encouraged to attend Heritage Foundation lectures, policy-briefings, and Third Generation Meetings.
<P>
<u><b>Summer Internships</u></B>:  Each summer, The Heritage Foundation selects approximately thirty-five interns to work full-time in various departments.  This program offers a weekly salary of $250.00.
<P>
<u><b>Academic Year Internships</u></b>:  During the academic year, a smaller number of interns are chosen to work either part or full-time in various departments.  This program offers a stipend of $8.00  per diem to cover expenses.

<b>The Heritage Foundation: Providing Practical Ideas for America's Future</b>
</center>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As the nation's leading think tank, The Heritage Foundation's impact on public policy is more pronounced than ever. As <I>The Wall 
Street Journal</I> wrote recently, "No policy shop has more clout than the conservative Heritage 
Foundation."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Indeed, many of the 104th Congress' plans for balancing 
the budget and scaling back big government began at Heritage. By providing official Washington 
with timely research and analysis, Heritage has become a primary information source for America's 
lawmakers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Heritage's people are more than just well-informed and 
well-educated. Many have hands-on government experience. They are doers as well as thinkers.  
Players, not just spectators. 
<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	If you need a thought-provoking, articulate expert to 
discuss today's important issues, The Heritage Foundation is the place to turn. Contact 
<a href="mailto:moebiusw@heritage.org">Wanda Moebius</a> at (202) 675-1761 to book a speaker.

Welcome to the Town Hall CyberPersonality site!  I can assure you that this is certainly a new venture for me.  I've heard of "talking heads" from the likes of "Capitol Gang," and what used to be "MacNeil-Lehrer," but an on-line Internet personality is one of newest ways The Heritage Foundation would like to get past the limited amount of media coverage of hot issues and tell you what is really happening in Washington, on Capitol Hill, in the White House, and in policy circles.
<P>
A little bit about me -- I'm <a href="/heritage/cyberbio.html">Karen Czarnecki Miller</a>, and I'm primarily responsible for maintaining contact with the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov">Clinton Administration</a>, educating the presidential campaigns on important policy issues, and overseeing The Heritage Foundation's <a href="/heritage/jobs/jobs.html">Job Bank</a>. I also serve as a spokesman for the Foundation on Heritage proposals and research findings in all areas of the Foundation's study.<p>


I'd like to tell you a little bit about what you can expect to see when you come to this site.  Of course, over the next several months, I'll be doing some fine-tuning to make this as interesting and informative as possible.  I'd like to hear your thoughts on what you'd like to see, and what would help you to keep on top of current issues. 
<p>
Twice a week -- on Tuesday and Friday -- I will be on-line to discuss hot topics on the Hill and elsewhere, and answer your questions.  I am also planning to post research materials, discuss what opinion leaders are saying, interview guests on politics and policy, and much more!  
<p>
What would you like to see? Please <a href="mailto:gabrona@heritage.org">email</a> your thoughts to me, or to <a href="mailto: gabrona@heritage.org">Andy Gabron</a>, who helps me with research
 for this page. I look forward to hearing from you!

Founded in 1973, The Heritage Foundation is a research and educational institute -- a think tank -- whose mission is to formulate and promote conservative public policies based on the principles of free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values, and a strong national defense.
<P>
<A HREF= "/heritage/staff/stafftoc.html">Heritage's  staff</A> pursues this mission by performing timely accurate research addressing key policy 
issues and effectively marketing these findings to its primary audiences: members of Congress, key congressional staff members, policymakers in the executive branch, the nation's news media, and the academic and policy communities. Heritage's products include publications, articles, lectures, conferences, and meetings.
<P>
Governed by an independent Board of Trustees,The Heritage Foundation is a non-partisan, tax exempt institution. Heritage relies on the private financial support of the general public -- individuals, foundations, and corporations -- for its income, and accepts no government funds and performs no contract work. Heritage is one of the nation's largest public policy research organization. More than 200,000 contributors make it the most broadly supported in America.

&quot;Transactional Politics&quot;</CENTER>

<P>Just by going about their highly difficult business, President Clinton
and Speaker Gingrich have been redefining campaigns and coalition-management.
Out of improvisation and intuition, they are trying things that might --
I would say should -- become a model for elected officials generally.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Everyone knows how a politician in search of power goes about making commitments,
implicit or explicit, to his or her natural constituencies, in the hopes
that all of them add up to a majority on election day. When the commitment-making
is blatant (Walter Mondale in 1984) or merely clumsy (George Bush in 1992),
the candidate is assaulted by the other party for &quot;pandering.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So far, so normal. But consider what signals are sent to the profession:
All candidates, from their first race on, are conditioned to see the commitment
game as a tightrope to be walked. Don't lean too far either way. Don't seem
aloof, but neither should you appear overobligated. Be loyal to your &quot;base&quot;
-- without becoming &quot;owned&quot; by these same voters' lobby groups.
Keep your options open in Washington -- but beware winding up with no one
who will fight to re-elect you at home.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Most voters see through the above balancing act, and many politicians become
exhausted by it -- that's the bad news. The good news is that Messrs. Clinton
and Gingrich -- fellow baby-boomers and master orators who imagine they
can convince anyone of anything -- have been developing a new set of tools
for riding herd on to their respective partisan coalitions. I call it transactional
leadership -- a sort of &quot;share the risk&quot; public deal-making that
emulates the norms of private life.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Consider a typical marriage in trouble. The husband is silent, morose, and
sick of being asked to share his feelings. The wife has therefore taken
to overstressing hers, and becoming both more needy and more bitter. One
public couple -- Michael and Kitty Dukakis -- played out this mirror-imagery
in the late 1980s. He was the rock, she was the hailstorm -- but, under
presidential-campaign pressure, each tendency made the other worse. Like
political forces, the two &quot;parties&quot; in a marriage can get dug
in at extremes that end up shriveling their union's productive &quot;center.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now consider a partnership, perhaps in real estate or law. Office footage
is being cut in half, so is the client-base, and the next year looks to
be a long dark trough. The partners can dig in and make demands, or they
can reach out and enlist this crisis of survival for some kind of longer-term
win/win. The partners could all commit to go six months without salary,
plowing all new revenue into (a) paying the unavoidable bills and (b) advertising
and other business-development. In short, share the risk -- and prove your
staying power.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
What the marriage crisis needs is this: &quot;I'll take the risk of reforming
if you take a risk and make some of your own needed changes. We will suffer
differently, but together, and in a hopeful direction.&quot; The business
example is one of going back to &quot;sweat equity,&quot; as if the partners
are starting the enterprise from scratch, by taking a blood oath to recapitalize
and build for the future.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now ask yourself: Does anything like that ever happen in the public phase
of politics? Forget the backstage favor-swapping and vote-trading among
individual legislators -- I'm talking about a top political figure proposing
a public transaction, to part of his electoral coalition, so a political
risk can be shared on the way to eliminating it. Technically this is not
a straight &quot;deal,&quot; but more of a negotiation begun while everyone
watches. The leader says: I'm willing to take the heat [for the group this
audience represents] on an unpopular vote. And I expect you to change your
act, and image, over the next two years so we don't have to bleed again
in the next Congress.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Of all national leaders, Newt Gingrich is the only one I see doing this
with gusto. I first witnessed it as his deputy press-secretary in September
1978, when President Jimmy Carter and a heavily Democratic 96th Congress
were pushing national price controls on hospitals. All the Georgia medical
groups expected Newt, about to win the first election, to fight his home-state
President's bill. And he said he would -- but he also told the Atlanta AMA,
point-blank, that they faced ultimate NATIONALIZATION if they stuck with
business-as-usual and ignored middle-class fears about profiteering and
bureaucracies. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It was great: A candidate telling his own supporters they can count on him
only so far. And beyond that? Get real, folks. Get serious about your own
survival in a democracy where the debate never stops.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Fifteen years later, during the first version of his famed &quot;Renewal&quot;
course, Gingrich did something similar. He told both the FDA and the AMA
-- the latter still an ally, the former a growing &quot;enemy&quot; -- to
work toward reform according to the same unifying principle. Listen to how
Newt phrases it:<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Guess what, gang? An awful lot of what the<B> </B>AMA is about is
a medieval guild: It is setting up government required rules that only if
you go through THIS school, pass THIS board, and are accepted by THIS group,
will we certify you. Now I don't think we should say, 'You want to do brain
surgery like Jethro on<I> The Beverly Hillbillies,</I> show up Tuesday...'
There ARE things you want certified; [but] I do think -- whether it's hospitals,
drugs, doctors or the Food &amp; Drug Administration -- there is a lot of
potential FLEXIBILITY in delivering things, and we need more pragmatism
and less credentials.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Thus spoke Newt, in November 1993, at Kennesaw State. The very same month,
to a quite different audience but one vital to his survival, Bill Clinton
also talked candidly. In Memphis, after a dazzling account of Martin Luther
King, middle-class black progress and urban mayhem, the President told a
vast assembly of black ministers: &quot;We have to make a partnership --
all the government agencies, all the business folks. But where there are
no families, where there is no order, where there is no hope, where we are
reducing the size of armed services because we have won the Cold War, who
will be there to give structure, discipline, and love to these children.
You must do that and we must help you.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At that moment, Clinton was leading the coalition that passed NAFTA. He
had just surprised Republican free-traders by enlisting most of the large
environmental groups. A re-elected George Bush could never have brought
these groups into the free-trade fold, and the way Clinton pulled it off
(with those so-called &quot;side agreements&quot;) amounted to competent
coalition-juggling -- and fairly public too. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
During his '92 campaign, Clinton had proposed a &quot;New Covenant,&quot;
under which different types of responsibility would become the price for
continued government support. His party, running Congress during 1993-94,
did not go along. Ironically, those Republicans who aren't ideologically
opposed to activist government -- chief among them Speaker Gingrich -- COULD
go along with the Clinton's 1992 themes as well as his Memphis framework.
So? Look for the New Covenant to come back in '96 with a different name.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Certain U.S. Presidents (JFK and LBJ occasionally, Teddy Roosevelt all the
time) have put forth sweeping proposals -- &quot;deals&quot; in the national
interest -- to groups inside their own political tent. Doing so acknowledges
the latter's influence -- while forcing them to use at least some of it
for a non-selfish purpose.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Contrast that with today's Republican candidates for President -- the people
who expect to replace Clinton and become Gingrich's main ally. They trudge
before all the hot groups -- gun-owners, medical interests, tobacco farmers,
Perot conventioneers -- and hand out plates of red meat festooned with iron-clad
pledges. FOR WHAT? No one, not even a habitual horse-trader like Phil Gramm,
so much as hints that these single-issue or self-righteous voter blocs owe
him, or the country, anything back. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Well, Mr. Would-Be President and Guardian of the National Interest, if you
are too much of a weenie to suggest something exalted, everyone watching
on C-SPAN assumes you require only the petty: PAC money and petitions and
buses for election day.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Especially today, more national officials need to notch down their interest-group
checkmarking and try out the Gingrich/Clinton model: BE real in your major
addresses, and GET real with some of your otherwise demanding audiences.
Float a deal -- not a petty one, but exalting: &quot;I will stick my neck
out for you here, but I expect a helping hand to transform this issue afterward,
for America.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Guess what? Whoever sees this play out whole will be reassured. After all,
national cynicism is so thick that few believe a candidate acts on altruism
or principle anyway. We assume their &quot;no strings attached&quot; pledge
is supposed to be rewarded, <I>sub rosa</I> and backstage, by money or access
later. Wouldn't it be far healthier to see our political leaders TRADE the
risks they take for some compatible restraint or innovation from the interest
groups each one has to work with? Bill Clinton did so to save NAFTA, and
Newt Gingrich is already refining this creatively &quot;transactional&quot;
leadership model for the great Medicare struggle. More leverage to him.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>THE proposition that human beings are created in the image of God is
one of the bedrock principles on which Western civilization was built. Its
influence can be detected in most, if not all, of the West's greatest achievements,
including representative democracy, human rights, free enterprise, and progress
in the arts and sciences.<BR>
<BR>
Yet a little over a century ago, this cardinal idea came under wholesale
attack by intellectuals drawing on the discoveries of modern science. Debunking
the traditional conceptions of both God and man, thinkers such as Charles
Darwin, Karl Marx, and Sigmund Freud portrayed human beings not as eternal
and accountable beings, but as animals or machines who inhabited a universe
ruled by chance and whose behavior and very thoughts were dictated by the
unbending forces of biology, chemistry, and environment. This materialistic
conception of reality eventually infected virtually every area of our culture,
from politics and economics to literature and music.<BR>
<BR>
The cultural consequences of this triumph of materialism were devastating.
Materialists denied the existence of objective standards binding on all
cultures, claiming that environment dictates our moral beliefs. Such moral
relativism was uncritically adopted by much of the social sciences, and
it still undergirds much of modern economics, political science, psychology
and sociology. <BR>
<BR>
Materialists also undermined personal responsibility by asserting that human
thoughts and behaviors are dictated by our biology and environment. The
results can be seen in modern approaches to criminal justice, product liability,
and welfare. In the materialist scheme of things, everyone is a victim and
no one can be held accountable for his or her actions.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, materialism spawned a virulent strain of utopianism. Thinking they
could engineer the perfect society through the application of scientific
knowledge, materialist reformers advocated coercive government programs
that falsely promised to create heaven on earth.<BR>
<BR>
Discovery Institute's <A HREF="crsc.html">Center for the Renewal of Science
and Culture</A> seeks nothing less than the overthrow of materialism and
its damning cultural legacies. Bringing together <A HREF="crscfellows.html">leading
scholars from the natural sciences </A>and those from the humanities and
social sciences, <A HREF="crscarts.html">the Center explores how new developments
in biology, physics and cognitive science</A> raise serious doubts about
scientific materialism and have re-opened the case for the supernatural.
The Center awards fellowships for original research, holds conferences,
and briefs policymakers about the opportunities for life after materialism.
<BR>
<BR>
The Center is directed by Discovery Senior Fellow Dr. <A HREF="meyer.html">Stephen
Meyer</A>. An Associate Professor of Philosophy at Whitworth College, Dr.
Meyer holds a Ph.D. in the History and Philosophy of Science from Cambridge
University. He formerly worked as a geophysicist for the Atlantic Richfield
Company.</H4>

<H5>In this intellectual and cultural climate, knowing how to teach biological
origins can be exceedingly difficult. When respected scientists disagree
about which theories are correct, teachers may be forgiven for not knowing
which ones to teach. ---- It is against this backdrop of challenge and opportunity
that the publisher offers this supplementary text, <A HREF="pandas.html"><I>Of
Pandas and People: The Central Question of Biological Origins</I>.</A> The
purpose of this text is to expose your students to the captivating and the
controversial in the origins debate.</H5>

Discovery Institute Press Release August 10, 1996</H5>
<H1><CENTER><BR>
<BR>
Major grants help establish <A HREF="crsc.html">Center for Renewal of Science
and Culture</A><BR>
<IMG SRC="trubluln.gif" WIDTH="600" HEIGHT="12" ALIGN="MIDDLE" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3"></CENTER>
</H1>
<B>For over a century, Western science has been influenced by the idea that
God is either dead or irrelevant. Two foundations recently awarded Discovery
Institute nearly a million dollars in grants to examine and confront this
materialistic bias in science, law, and the humanities. The grants will
be used to establish the Center for the Renewal of Science and Culture at
Discovery, which will award research fellowships to scholars, hold conferences,
and disseminate research findings among opinionmakers and the general public.
</B><BR>
<BR>
Heading the Center will be <A HREF="meyer.html">Discovery Senior Fellow
Stephen Meyer</A>. An associate professor of philosophy at Whitworth College,
Meyer did his doctoral studies in origin-of-life biology at Cambridge University
and is an associate editor of the scientific journal Origins and Design
. The Center's co-director will be <A HREF="jwestbio.html">Discovery Senior
Fellow John West</A>, asst. professor of political science at Seattle Pacific
University. West oversees Discovery's <A HREF="religion.html">Religion,
Liberty &amp; Civic Life</A> program. <BR>
<BR>
Working with Meyer and West will be an array of scholars and advisors from
around the world, including Phillip Johnson, professor of law at the University
of California, Berkeley, and author of <I>Darwin on Trial</I> (1992) and
<I>Reason in the Balance</I> (1995), and chemistry professor Michael Behe,
author of the much-anticipated <I>Darwin's Black Box</I>, on sale now at
major bookstores.<BR>
<BR>
Ina addition, the Center will award several full-time research fellowships
each year. For 1996-97, the full-time Discovery research fellows will be
William Dembski, Paul Nelson and Jonathan Wells. Dr. Dembski has a long
history of mathematical study at University of Chicago, Cornell and MIT
and is a fundamental contributor in the fields of chance, chaos, probability
and randomness theory. Currently, Dembski is completing a second doctorate
in philosophy. Nelson is in the final weeks of his Ph.D. program in philosophy
of science, also at the University of Chicago, and is the editor of the
scientific journal Origins and Design. Dr. Wells holds doctorates in molecular
and cell biology from UC Berkeley and religious studies from Yale University.
He is the author of the book Charles Hodge's Critique of Darwinism.<BR>
<BR>
The new Center grew out of last summer's <B>&quot;Death of Materialism&quot;</B>
conference that Discovery organized and which has gathered increased attention
since the four keynote addresses were published by the Intercollegiate Review
earlier this year.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The conference pointed the way,&quot; Discovery President Bruce Chapman
says, &quot;and helped us mobilize support to attack the scientific argument
for the 20th century's ideology of materialism and the host of social 'isms'
that attend it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Crucial, start-up funding has come from Fieldstead &amp; Company, and the
Stewardship Foundation which also awarded a grant. <BR>
<BR>
The Center for Renewal of Science and Culture fits well with Discovery's
existing programs in high technology and religion. <A HREF="gilder.html">George
Gilder</A>, who heads Discovery's technology program, has a long-standing
interest in the interaction of science and culture. The end of his book
<I>Microcosm</I> explores the social and spiritual implications of contemporary
physics, another one of his works-in-process deals with the cultural necessity
of faith.

<H3>The Looming Crisis</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Is your financial future at risk? Do you worry that your stnadard
of living is threatened? Does it concern you that for the first time in
America's history young adults today do not believe they will exceed the
achievements of their parents' generation?<BR>
<BR>
If you answered yes you are not alone. Millions of us -- Baby Boomers and
Gen Xers -- have lost faith in America's twin promises of retirment security.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>Saving Social Security</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Some people think we can shore up the failing Social Security
system by pouring billions more tax dollars into a system basically unchanged
since President Roosevelt introduced in in 1935. Others say it should be
scrapped altogether, that we should break the promises ratified by every
US President since Roosevelt.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H3>The Mission</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Economic Security 2000 is committed to reviving the Roosevelet
committment to retirment security and restoring economic opportunity to
millioins of Americans, many workings tow and three jobs without getting
ahead.<BR>
<BR>
We have time to transform Social Security, but we must act quickly -- before
the year 2000. America's third cnetury can be an era of security, ownership,
growth, savings, investment, and unprecedented prosperity.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H4>Economic Security 2000 presents a blueprint for restoring the American
Dream. This is your call to action. Together let's begin a national debate.<BR>
<BR>
We cannot continue a pay-as-you-go Social Security System that will require
staggering tax increases and huge cuts in benefits.<BR>
<BR>
We cannton abandon Social Security and Roosevelt promise of a safety net
for retirees, non-wage earners, and the disabled.<BR>
<BR>
Let's take the sensible approach and capitalize the system and save Social
Security.</H4>

<P>Suppose you are 20 years old and earning $10,000 a year. You and your
employer are paying $1,240 a year in Social Security taxes. That's 12.4
percent of your hard-earned income, for benefits that you will never see.
<BR>
<BR>
Suppose instead you could invest that same $1,240, as well as an additional
$2.50 a week. By the time you are 65, thanks to the magic of compound interest,
you would be a millionaire. You would be assured a comfortable retirement.
<BR>
<BR>
This isn't a game-show fantasy. This isn't a lottery jackpot. It is a realistic
goal. But unlocking this economic opportunity means revolutionizing Social
Security. Every American who earns $10,000 a year or more can become a millionaire
over the course of one working lifetime&oacute;45 years. By the year 2000,
there will be over 100 million Americans who fall in this category. <BR>
<BR>
In a recent survey, Americans between the ages of 18 and 34 reported they
are more likely to see a UFO (46 percent) than their Social Security benefits
(28 percent). They're right. The Social Security trust fund starts running
out of money, under current projections, in the year 2013. If you're 20
today, that's when you turn 38. By the year 2030, when you turn 55, the
fund will be short $200 billion a year and be unable to meet one quarter
of its obligations. By the year 2042, when you turn 67 and reach your so-called
normal retirement age, the fund will have an accumulated debt of $4.7 trillion.
I'm not making this up. This isn't science fiction. These numbers come from
the 1994 report of the trustees of the Social Security system. <BR>
<BR>
You could get all your benefits, of course, if there were an enormous tax
increase for your children and grandchildren. According to the Social Security
trustees, honoring existing promises for Social Security and Medicare benefits
will require a rise in payroll taxes from the current level of 15.3 percent
to 25.7 percent in 2030. But that simply isn't going to happen. Americans
are already overtaxed. Do you think they'll put up with 25 percent payroll
taxes, and federal income taxes, plus state and local taxes on top of that?
<BR>
<BR>
Some politicians will tell you not to worry: Social Security is building
up a big trust fund that will take care of all those promises. By the end
of this year, the trust fund will have $475 billion in assets&oacute;on
paper. By 2020, there will be $3 trillion on paper. The trouble is, when
the program needs the money, the money will already have been spent on everything
the federal government spends money on. To redeem its IOUs to the trust
fund, the federal government will have to borrow money or raise taxes&oacute;by
over $36,000 per family&oacute;just as if the trust fund had no assets at
all. <BR>
<BR>
So you and your employer are now paying one eighth of your income to pay
for the Social Security benefits of current retirees, and to build up an
illusory trust fund. Meanwhile, your own retirement is in jeopardy. <BR>
<BR>
No wonder younger Americans fear they are on a treadmill. No wonder there
is so much trepidation about the future of the country. No wonder we have
a savings crisis: our savings are being spent. No wonder most Americans
now say their children will enjoy less opportunity than they do. <BR>
<BR>
It doesn't have to be this way. Social Security can be saved without raising
taxes, and without lowering the benefits or cost-of-living adjustments of
existing retirees. Social Security can be saved in a way that will open
up opportunity for younger people&oacute;so that their standard of living
will be better than that of their parents and grandparents. If we use the
principles of democratic capitalism to reform Social Security, the 20-year-old
making the minimum wage can become a millionaire by the time he or she retires.
<BR>
<BR>
Most Americans are on a treadmill because they have but one source of income:
wages. The way to get ahead is to earn income from capital. Money makes
money. With capital, you can retire in comfort and bequeath a nest egg to
your children. <BR>
<BR>
Here is the beauty of capitalism. Any American currently earning $12,580
or more pays $30 a week, or $1,560 a year, into Social Security. Imagine
that, beginning at age 20, you invest that $30 a week at market rates. When
you retire, you'll be a millionaire. Whoever earns at least the minimum
wage can become a millionaire in 45 years. <BR>
<BR>
The secret is compound interest. Let's assume a long-term return on your
investments of 8 percent a year. (This is a prudent assumption; the annual
return on the Standard & Poor's 500 over the past 70 years, including the
Great Depression, is actually 10.19 percent.) If you can save $30 a week
($1,560 a year), after 10 years the value of your portfolio is $29,000.
After 20 years, it is $110,000. After 30 years, it is $318,000. Forty years&oacute;$822,000.
And 45 years&oacute;the normal working lifetime&oacute;$1.3 million. After
50 years, if you work until age 70, the value of your portfolio crescendoes
to an estimated $2 million. <BR>
<BR>
You wouldn't exactly be a millionaire in today's dollars. If we adjust for
inflation of about 4 percent a year, your portfolio of $1.3 million after
45 years would be closer to $230,000. That's still a larger nest egg than
most working Americans even dream of. With that amount of capital, you could
purchase an annuity at age 65 that would give you $18,256 a year (in today's
dollars) during your retirement years. <BR>
<BR>
The way to save Social Security is to make the magic of compound interest
work for its beneficiaries. I've been developing a proposal that will save
Social Security&oacute;and enable 100 million Americans to become millionaires.
The plan keeps Social Security as a mandatory, redistributive savings program,
but it converts the program from the current pay-as-you-go system to a funded
system, in which individuals own retirement portfolios at Social Security
and choose private investment managers. Individuals would be allowed to
set aside portions of their Social Security payments, together with additional
voluntary contributions, in their own personal accounts. They could use
their accounts for retirement income and pass on the capital tax free to
their children. The plan has four basic elements: <BR>
<BR>
Pay existing obligations to all current retirees. Social Security benefits
would be paid to all existing retirees, as promised, without changes, and
without reductions. <BR>
<BR>
Divide Social Security into two tiers. If you are working now, you and your
employer would continue to pay existing Social Security taxes of 12.4 percent
on the first $61,200 of your income. Some of that would go to pay the benefits
of existing recipients. Some of your payments would go into your own personal
account. Payroll taxes would not rise from their current level. They would
be cut by 2 percentage points around the year 2040. <BR>
<BR>
The benefits of current retirees would be paid out of the first tier&oacute;current
payroll taxes. When they retire, current workers would draw benefits from
two Social Security sources: income from future payroll taxes and income
from their personal retirement accounts. <BR>
<BR>
Create personal investment and retirement accounts for the second tier of
Social Security. Every worker who earns at least $4,000 would have his own
IRA-like account with Social Security. (Unlike an IRA, you could use your
account only for retirement, and could not withdraw from it earlier.) The
first $500 that you and your employer pay into Social Security every year
would be automatically deposited in your personal retirement account. You
could increase the deposit in your personal retirement account by up to
$3,000 per year by making voluntary contributions that would be matched
by Social Security taxes you are already paying. The size of the match would
vary according to income. <BR>
<BR>
Here's an example: If you earn $10,000 a year and you contribute $1,240
per year, the first $500 of this money would be paid into your personal
account. If you add a savings match of $130, the Social Security program
will deposit an additional $610 of tax money you are already paying into
the fund into your personal retirement account, for a total of $1,240 per
year. In 45 years, your portfolio will be $1,026,524 and you're a millionaire.
<BR>
<BR>
If you are making $50,000, you might wish to put the maximum of $3,000 per
year into your personal account at Social Security; $1,500 of the $3,000
comes from taxes you are already paying, and $1,500 comes from additional
funds you save from your income, that is, from a personal-savings match.
In 45 years, your portfolio would be $2.5 million. <BR>
<BR>
This money would be in your name, you would own it, and you would be in
charge of picking an investment manager to invest it for you. Social Security
would set up a corporation whose only purpose is to certify and approve
private-sector money managers. (Criteria would include performance and experience
in money management, years in business, and certfiably good character.)
You would pick your investment manager from this list, and could switch
to a different one any time you wanted. This sort of system is already working
well in Chile. <BR>
<BR>
Use your capital account to increase your retirement income, and pass on
your assets tax free to your children. When you retire, you would have two
attractive choices of what to do with your capital account. One would be
to use income from your capital (5 percent a year) for your retirement benefits&oacute;and
then, when you die, to pass on your entire capital account tax free to your
children or heirs. The second would be to purchase an annuity with your
capital account, and receive higher retirement benefits during your lifetime
but not pass any assets on to your children or heirs. <BR>
<BR>
Based on current life-expectancy charts, when you reach 65 you can expect
to live, on average, to age 83, an additional 18 years. With an annuity
you could currently receive an estimated 7.9 percent return per year. <BR>
<BR>
If you have a small portfolio when you retire, your Social Security benefits
would be paid as promised out of the income from your capital (5 percent
a year), as well as payroll taxes from future workers. Suppose, for instance,
you have $100,000 in your personal account, and promised Social Security
benefits of $10,000 a year. You would receive $5,000 in Social Security
income from your capital, and $5,000 through the regular payroll-tax base.
When you die, you would then be able to pass your retirement assets on to
your children or heirs. <BR>
<BR>
As portfolios grow through compound interest, however, tens of millions
of retirees would have the opportunity to increase their benefits. Twenty-year-olds
today earning $10,000 a year will retire at age 65 in 2040. If the wages
keep up with expected inflation, their final wages will be $15,236. Their
promised present-law Social Security benefits will be $9,121 per year (a
59.9 percent replacement level). If payroll taxes are not increased, Social
Security benefits would be reduced 24.4 percent&oacute;from $9,121 to $6,892
per year. <BR>
<BR>
Under the Beard system, these retirees would have $1,026,524 in their personal
accounts with Social Security ($182,769 in today's money). If they choose
an annuity, their Social Security benefits will be $14,511 per year&oacute;$5,390
higher than present-law Social Security promises. If they wish to pass the
$1,026,524 tax free onto their children or heirs, their benefits will be
$9,138. <BR>
<BR>
It would be enormously expensive to move from a pay-as-you-go to a funded
Social Security system. Annual deposits into personal capital accounts would
begin at over $100 billion per year and climb to over $200 billion per year
(in today's dollars) by 2040. And this would be in addition to the massive
deficits already projected for Social Security beginning in 2013. How can
America possibly afford these expenses? The money would come from five sources.
<BR>
<BR>
Over time, the largest increase in Social Security revenue would come from
the income of the new capital accounts. By 2040, after 45 years in operation,
the estimated value of retirees' capital accounts in today's dollars would
be $8 trillion, almost double the current value of the private pension system.
If we assume 5 percent income from capital to pay retirement benefits, retirees
would receive over $400 billion every year from their capital (in today's
dollars). <BR>
<BR>
Social Security payroll taxes currently exceed payments by about $25 billion
a year. This surplus would go into the personal capital accounts. So would
the $475 billion in assets that have supposedly accumulated in the Social
Security trust fund. Those assets don't really exist, but workers have paid
extra taxes on the federal government's promise that the surplus would go
to a trust fund. Amortized over 20 years, the trust fund could be drawn
down at the rate of $30 billion a year. In practice, this will mean that
other federal expenditures will have to be cut by the same amount, bonds
of $30 billion will have to sold to the public, or taxes will have to be
raised by $30 billion. <BR>
<BR>
Some $60 billion a year would be saved through a special debt instrument
we call the Liberty Bond. The Liberty Bond would be a voluntary 30-year
interest-paying instrument. After 30 years, heirs and designees would receive
principal and interest tax free. It would be marketed to retirees who do
not need all their benefits to enjoy a comfortable retirement, and would
gladly forego some of their benefits if they were sure this would help their
children. <BR>
<BR>
I anticipate that five to 10 million Americans would purchase Liberty Bonds.
Millions of retirees would gladly set aside $1,000 per year to create a
$25,000 tax-free education fund for their children and grandchildren. Many
would even set aside their full benefits&oacute;$10,000 to $15,000 a year
for their remaining lifetime&oacute;to build a nest egg for their children.
The government could create a cap of $95 billion per year on the sale of
Liberty Bonds, so that no more money is deferred than necessary. <BR>
<BR>
To make the numbers work, benefits will also have to be reduced for future
retirees. There are two fair ways to do this. One is to raise the normal
retirement age from the current 67 to 70, a change that can be phased in
gradually. We are all living longer and we are in better health as we age.
It is fair to extend the normal retirement age as our own lifetimes are
extended. And in any case, with individual capital accounts in Social Security
and the power of compound interest, Americans will want to work longer&oacute;because
they'll have the opportunity to build up even larger nest eggs. <BR>
<BR>
The second way to reduce Social Security benefits fairly is to reduce indexation
for real wage growth. It is important to index Social Security for inflation.
Once you retire, the cost of living continues to rise as a result of inflation.
Without cost-of-living adjustments, the purchasing power of your benefits
will decrease an estimated 4 percent per year. But Social Security is indexed
again for real wage growth&oacute;about 1 percent a year. This is icing
on the cake for retirees. It is not necessary, and it could be reduced by
50 percent. <BR>
<BR>
The current pay-as-you-go system is an economic, political, and cultural
dead end. It will force us to raise taxes, and then raise taxes again to
pay promised benefits, or to cut benefits and then cut benefits again to
avoid mammoth tax increases. It will create no new capital opportunities.
It will drain a growing amount of America's resources&oacute;our savings
and investment&oacute;out of the private sector. A shrinking private sector
damages our ability to create new jobs and new industries&oacute;our future
strength. <BR>
<BR>
The current system is also a recipe for conflict. If America is a shrinking
pie, the young generation and older generation will fight over the crumbs.
<BR>
<BR>
Under a funded, two-tier system, we would cut payroll taxes 2 percentage
points in 2040 and then cut them again. As the system matures, we would
increase retirement benefits by 25 to 35 percent. We would create 100 million
millionaires. We would amass unprecedented savings and investment in America
by opening the doors of capital ownership to most Americans. We would create
a capital pool that no other nation in the world can equal, and use this
investment to finance the high-paying jobs and new industries of tomorrow.
<BR>
<BR>
By making every American a capitalist, a funded Social Security system would
unleash new economic growth, raise the standard of living of our children,
and return America to its historic role as the country of tomorrow, with
its best days yet to come. <BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Discovery Institute fellows submit their analysis and proposals
for dialogue through seminars, conferences, and debates; they produce reports,
articles, books, Congressional testimony, films and an interactive Internet
website that helps spread the knowledge of the Institute's idea. They also
consult with elected and appointive officials, business people, academics,
media and the general public to show how 21st century humanity can benefit
from the principles, policies, and practices advocated by the Institute.<BR>
<BR>
The point of view Discovery brings to its work includes a belief in God-given
reason and the permanency of human nature; the principles of representative
democracy and public service expounded by the American Founders; free market
economics domestically and internationally; the social requirement to balance
personal liberty with reposnsibility; the spirit of voluntarism crucial
to civil society; the continuing validity of American international leadership;
and the potential of science and technology to promote an improved future
for individuals, families and communities.<BR>
<BR>
<A HREF="fellows.html">Fellows</A>, members, board, advisors and staff of
Discovery constitute a distributive public policy community, connected through
cyberspace, with headquarters in Seattle and an office in Washington, D.C.
Fellows are multi-disciplinary in background and approach. A research and
advocacy project is selected when it is in harmony with Discovery's mission,
when the Institute can make an original and significant contribution to
the issue's development and when it is within the Insitute's resources.
Most <A HREF="current.html">issues selected</A> are of national or international
scope and fall in the fields of science, technology, environment and economy,
international affairs, culture, defense, legal reform, religion and public
life, transportation, and institutions of reprsentative democracy, as well
as bi-national cooperation in the international Cascadia region.<BR>
<BR>
Financially, the institute is a non-profit educational foundation funded
by philanthropic foundation grants, corporate and individual contributions
and the dues of institute members. </B></BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3><CENTER>WILL THE INTERNET COLLAPSE? NO WAY!</CENTER>
</H3>
What is all this commotion in Massachusetts? The very source of the Arpanet
at Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman--the cradle of the Internet--Massachusetts
is falling to the forces of Auntie Spiker and Aunt Sponge.<BR>
<BR>
These are the mingy ladies in the Roald Dahl story who rejoiced in James's
Giant Peach as long as it didn't take flight. Now Massachusetts--the state
that once barred Apple shares as a likely West Coast levitation scam--looks
askance at the Giant Peach of the Internet, aloft in Silicon Valley and
around the globe, with James Clark, James Gosling, Netscape and a series
of thin-air IPOs.<BR>
<BR>
Howard Anderson of Boston's Yankee Group, long an Internet tout, thinks
those wired yahoos on Wall Street and Sand Hill Road are blind to the inevitable
sine waves of advance: What goes up must come down, he sternly avers, trying
to bring some simple physics to the scene, as if the Internet has to obey
the law of gravity.<BR>
<BR>
And now Bob Metcalfe--Metcalfe himself!--inventor of Ethernet, pioneer of
Arpanet and the founding father of the networking era. Here he is, prophesying
lugubriously into every megaphone he can grasp, from the New York Times
Magazine and PBS to U.S. News &amp; World Report and InfoWorld, that the
Internet will collapse in 1996. Metcalfe now predicts a general retreat
to Intranets, shielded from the public system and unavailable to it.<BR>
<BR>
Metcalfe was striking a blow against the very solar plexus of my prophecies.
I had founded my confidence in the Internet on the continuing power of the
law of the telecosm, an edict adapted from Metcalfe's very own law of networks.
Metcalfe's Law ordains that the value of a network rises by the square of
the number of terminals attached to it.<BR>
<BR>
In its most basic form, this law merely captures the exponential rise in
the value of any network device, such as a telephone, with the rise in the
number of other such devices reachable by it. Metcalfe, however, shrewdly
added in the declining cost of Ethernet adapters and other network gear
as the Net expanded. In the law of the telecosm, I summed up these and other
learning-curve factors by incorporating into Metcalfe's Law the law of the
microcosm.<BR>
<BR>
Based on the power-delay product in semiconductors, the law of the microcosm
ordains that the cost-effectiveness of the terminals will rise by the square
of the number of additional transistors integrated on a single chip. Amplified
by the law of the microcosm, the law of the telecosm signifies the rise
in the cost-effectiveness of a network in proportion to the resources deployed
on it and the number of potential nodes and routers available to it.<BR>
<BR>
As the network expands, each new computer both uses it as a resource and
contributes resources to it. This is the secret of the stability of the
Internet. The very process of growth that releases avalanches of new traffic
onto the Net precipitates a cascade of new capacity at Internet service
providers (ISPs). They supply new servers and routers, open new routes and
pathways for data across the Web, and buy new terminals and edge switches
to upgrade their connections to the Network Access Points (NAPs), the Internet
supernodes that in turn exert pressure on the backbone vendors to expand
their own bandwidth.<BR>
<BR>
Because all these routes and resources are interlinked, they are available
to absorb excess traffic caused by outages, crashes or congestion elsewhere
on the Net. Because all these resources are growing in cost-effectiveness
at the exponential pace of the law of the microcosm, and total available
bandwidth on the Net is rising at the still-faster pace of the law of the
telecosm, the Internet has been able to double in size annually since 1970
and increase its traffic two times faster still, without suffering any crippling
crashes beyond the Morris worm of 1988.<BR>
<BR>
Impelling the growth of the largest interconnected network, the law of the
telecosm means that the most open computer networks will prevail. Proprietary
networks lose to a worldwide web.<BR>
<BR>
<B>LOADED FOR BEAR </B><BR>
<BR>
I wanted to answer Metcalfe's challenge. As the apparent winner of a previous
argument over ATM and Ethernet [see Forbes ASAP, &quot;Metcalfe's Law and
Legacy,&quot; Sept. 13, 1993], I thought I might have an edge (after all,
Fast Ethernet outsells ATM at least 20 to 1). But when he met me on a rainy
day late in May at his Boston townhouse on Beacon Street, where he looks
benevolently across the Charles at the mit campus, Metcalfe was loaded for
Internet bear. At the peak of his influence, this smiling cover boy of June's
ieee Spectrum, winner of the 1996 ieee Medal of Honor, was ready to explain.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I am way out on a limb here,&quot; he says over sushi and wasabi at
a restaurant near his house. &quot;I actually told a World Wide Web conference
I would eat my column if the Internet didn't collapse....<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What do I mean by a collapse? Well, the FCC requires telcos to report
all outages that affect more than 50,000 lines for more than an hour. I
mean something much bigger than that.&quot; I suggested that with enough
raw tuna and wasabi, his column would go down well. But Metcalfe was dead
serious.<BR>
<BR>
The Internet will collapse and it will be good for us, and for the Net.
&quot;The collapse has a purpose. The Internet is currently in the clutches
of superstition, promoted by a bio-anarchic intelligentsia, which holds
that the Net is wonderfully chaotic and brilliantly biological, and homeopathically
self-healing by processes of natural selection and osmosis. The purpose
of the collapse will be to discredit this ideology.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;What the Internet is--surprise, surprise--is a network of computers.
It needs to be managed, engineered and financed as a network of computers
rather than as an unfathomable biological organism.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Metcalfe's intellectual targets are not hard to find. He dubs them the &quot;Wired
intelligentsia, epitomized by Nicholas Negroponte,&quot; and, one supposes,
author/editor Kevin Kelly and hippie mystic seer John Perry Barlow, celebrating
a &quot;neo-biological civilization out of control.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
For example, at a recent meeting of NANOG (North American Network Operations
Group), whenever Metcalfe brought up the problems of Internet management--the
need for a settlements-and-payments process so that people who invest in
the Net backbone can get their money back--&quot;they kept telling me to
get lost.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;They'd tell me, 'You just don't get it, do you?' This is the worst
possible charge of the politically correct: 'You just don't get it.' The
implication is that I am a clueless newbie.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;But I am not a newbie and I do get it: an accelerating pattern of
wild behavior on the Internet [caused by] a breakdown of any relationship
between supply and demand for Internet services, any way of metering usage,
any method of paying back people who invest in the backbone. One thing is
sure: They will not be paid by biofeedback loops.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The result is bad--the deterioration of the public Internet and the
rise of private Intranets. These are not really part of the Internet at
all. Many of them use 'hot potato routing,' throwing any messages from nonsubscribers
back into the pot. It is a tragedy of the commons, a shrinkage of the public
network on which we all ultimately depend.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Since I had frequently cited Metcalfe's Law as an answer to &quot;The Tragedy
of the Commons&quot; argument, this charge hit home.<BR>
<BR>
Metcalfe warns that &quot;back when Internet backbones carried 15 terabytes
of traffic per month, the world's Ethernet capacity was 15 exabytes per
month, a million times higher.&quot; (Exabytes, if you wonder, add up. While
a terabyte is a 1 with 12 zeros after it, an exabyte commands 18 zeros.)
But those were last year's numbers. Carrier of some 40% of backbone traffic,
MCI now reports 250 terabytes per month. Just a small shift in local traffic
onto the public Net can create catastrophic cascades of congestion.<BR>
<BR>
With private networks increasingly becoming TCP/IP Intranets that can use
the Internet but shield their resources from it by &quot;firewalls,&quot;
the likelihood of a crippling cascade from private to public Nets grows
more acute every day. According to Metcalfe, one way or another, such a
disaster is now at hand.<BR>
<BR>
His primary evidence is data from the Routing Arbiter at Merit (the Michigan
group that commands routing servers at every NAP and collects Internet statistics
by &quot;pinging&quot; routers across the Net every few minutes). Merit's
pings yield an echo of chaos: &quot;a dramatic, accelerating rise of packet
losses, delays and routing instability. This data is available on the Net.
But the Merit people are afraid of making waves, offending the big carriers,
so they don't really tell anyone how bad it is.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I ask my readers [at InfoWorld], and they tell me they think the Net
has already collapsed.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
As the North American guild of network operators, what does NANOG need?
I asked. &quot;One thing NANOG definitely needs,&quot; sums up Metcalfe,
&quot;is more people in suits.&quot; The trouble with NANOG is that it is
full of biomystics with big beards and Birkenstocks who look like Bob Metcalfe
did when he finally got his Ph.D. from Harvard after a dramatic setback
the year before, when his thesis board flunked him at the last minute.<BR>
<BR>
(Perhaps it was because he &quot;hated Harvard&quot; and spent all his time
at mit and Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman, laying the foundations for the Internet
with Larry Roberts rather than sitting humbly at the feet of Crimson computer
scientists refining their professorial perks and queues. Republished in
June under the title Packet Communication, with a new introduction from
the author, Metcalfe's thesis is now recognized as a classic text on networking
that anticipated most of the evolution from the Arpanet to the Internet.
In the front of the new edition is a picture of Metcalfe as a newbie at
the Harvard commencement, with a big beard and a weird shirt and jacket,
looking kind of like a bio-anarchic, Harvard-hating Hawaiian homeopath himself,
ready to help start the Internet movement back in 1973.)<BR>
<BR>
What does this all mean? The conversion of Bill Gates into an Internet obsessive.
The jeremiads of Metcalfe, one of my favorite people in the industry, both
as a technical seer and conservative economic voice in a webby-minded wilderness.
What do I make of the descent into vapor of several of my favored technologies
and the admitted biodegradation of the Net?<BR>
<BR>
<B>NEW SCARCITY, NEW ABUNDANCE</B><BR>
<BR>
Rather than debating this apparent jumble of conjectures--and for a second
time jousting with the Olympian Metcalfe--I would instead transcend the
details in a larger theme: Marking every industrial and economic transformation
are new forms of scarcity and new forms of abundance.<BR>
<BR>
Economics has been termed the dismal science of scarcity. Indeed, scarcity
is at the heart of most economic models; many of my critics still live in
the grip of the dismal scarcities and zero sums of pre-Netic economics.
But what is the controlling scarcity of an information age? In the Industrial
Age, natural resources and real estate were scarce. But Julian Simon of
the University of Maryland has shown that, as manifested by falling real
prices, all natural resources, such as foodstuffs, minerals, clean air and
available water and energy, have been increasing in abundance over the last
century.<BR>
<BR>
If conventional resources are becoming more abundant, what is the ruling
scarcity of the information era? Is it information? Hardly. The information
glut has become a ruling clich&Egrave;. As all resources--from energy to
information--become more abundant, the pressure of economic scarcity falls
ever more heavily on one key residual, and that single shortage looms ever
more stringent and controlling. The governing scarcity of the information
economy is time: the shards of a second, the hours in a day, the years in
a life, the latency of memory, the delay in aluminum wires, the time to
market, the time to metastasis, the time to retirement.<BR>
<BR>
The ruling scarcities in the economy of time, however, can be distilled
to two commanding limits: the speed of light and the span of life. They
form the boundaries of all enterprise.<BR>
<BR>
The speed of light is the most basic constraint in information technology.
As a key limit, the speed of light shapes the future architectures and topologies
of computers and communications. For example, the light-speed limit dictates
that the fastest computers will tend to be the smallest computers. Electrons
move nine inches a nanosecond (a billionth of a second). As computers move
toward gigahertz clock rates--a billion cycles a second--the longest data
path must be decisively smaller than nine inches. Pulses of electromagnetic
energy--photons--take some 20 milliseconds to cross the country and one-quarter
second to reach a satellite in geostationary orbit (as you notice in a satellite
phone call). At a gigabit per second, this means that as many as 250 megabits
of data--many thousands of IP packets, for example--can be latent (or lost)
in transit at any time, thus playing havoc with most prevalent network protocols,
such as TCP.<BR>
<BR>
Thus light speed is a centrifuge. It abhors concentration in one place,
ordains that these small supercomputers will be distributed across the globe
and will always be near to a network node. Although the networks will be
global in reach, they will depend on the principle of locality: the tendency
of memory or network accesses to focus on clusters of contiguous addresses
at any one time. Light speed imposes limits on the pace of any one processor
or conduit, and pushes both computer and communications technologies into
increasingly parallel and redundant architectures.<BR>
<BR>
As a governing scarcity in the new economy, no less important than the speed
of light is the span of life. Just as light speed represents the essential
limits of information technology, lifespan defines the essential shortage
of human time. Although medical and other health-related advances have increased
the span of life in the United States some 5 years in the last 25--while
the media focused on aids and cancer, and zero-sum pundits declared that
our descendants, the scions of our science, will live less well than we
do--the ultimate lifespan remains limited. Indeed, the modal economic activity
of the information economy is exploitation of the technologies of the speed
of light to increase the effective span of life by increasing efficiency
in the use of time.<BR>
<BR>
GDP and other economic numbers from the National Income and Product Accounts
(NIPA) totally miss the minting of new time through innovation: the opening
of parallel universes of choice in ideas, courses, arts, letters, entertainments,
therapies and communities. Finding stagnation and poverty and agonizing
over new wealth, Morgan Stanley gapologist Stephen Roach plumbs the shallows
of NIPA for all the world like the CIA economists who found the Soviets
exceeding the United States in growth for 17 years. Video teleconferencing,
telecommuting, teleputing, digital wireless telephony, Internet mail, cybercommerce,
telemedicine and teleducation all are in the process of compressing the
span of life toward the increasingly thronged channels of the speed of light.<BR>
<BR>
If time is scarce, what is the growing and defining source of abundance
among all the material abundances in the information economy? Signifying
the definitive abundance in any economic era is the plummeting price of
a key factor of production. In order to grow fast, every new-era company
must exploit the drop in the cost of the newly abundant resource. Companies
that use the resource that is plummeting in cost will gain market share
against all other companies and will come increasingly to dominate the economy.<BR>
<BR>
<B>FROM WATTS TO MIPS AND BITS</B><BR>
<BR>
Over the last hundred years, there have been three such economic eras. The
industrial era fed on the plummeting price of physical force or energy,
best measured in watts. Some 30 years ago, with the regulatory sclerosis
of the nuclear and natural gas industries, the price of watts began to plateau,
dropping less than 0.7% per year for the last 35 years. The last 30 years
brought the reign of the microcosm, which fed on the plummeting price of
transistors, manifested in the exponential drop in the cost of computer
MIPS (millions of instructions per second) and memory bits. For the last
30 years, the price of a bit of semiconductor memory has dropped 68% per
year. With this year's decline in DRAM prices, the trend line is being resumed
after a four-year hiatus. The likely result is a sharp upside surprise in
PC sales--and thus in chips--through 1997.<BR>
<BR>
As fast as the price of MIPS and bits continues to drop, however, this Moore's
Law trend line will no longer dominate the economy. Like a great river headed
for a falls, a new factor of production is racing toward a historic cliff
of costs. Over the next 30 years, the spearhead of wealth creation will
be the telecosm, marked by the plummeting cost of bandwidth--communications
power--measured in gigabits per second.<BR>
<BR>
This result means that the growth of bandwidth will outpace the growth of
processor power. After an entire career keyed on Moore's Law, Bill Gates
remains skeptical, foreseeing an era of middleband nets, with shared cables
bogging down in gigabytes from tomcruise. com/vrml and fiber gushing into
twisted copper cul-de-sacs. The usually savvy Network Computing columnist
Bill Frezza believes that bandwidth is inherently a slower-moving technology
than processing, because bandwidth has to be delivered at once to an entire
area while processors can be sold one at a time. Robert Lucky, Bell system
laureate, and Paul Green of IBM debated these points two decades ago. Stressing
the dependence of bandwidth on the labor-intensive digging of trenches and
stretching of wires across continents and under seabeds, Lucky doubted that
communications could ever be truly cheap. Paul Green, a computer network
man, thought that digital computer communications could join the Moore's
Law learning curve.<BR>
<BR>
The evidence mounts that Green was more than right. Impressed by Green's
own achievements in fiber optics, Lucky now acknowledges that communications
power will grow at least tenfold more than computing power over the next
decade. Using the rough metric of Moore's Law, computer power doubles every
18 months. Bandwidth is now doubling at least every year. Over a 10-year
period, this means a hundredfold rise in computer power and at least a thousandfold
rise in bandwidth, measured at any point in the network from the home to
the backbone.<BR>
<BR>
The reason communications power has lagged behind computer power is not
the difference in technology but in regulation. Moore's Law in bandwidth
has given way to what venture capitalist Roger McNamee calls Moron's Law,
the labyrinthine tangle of tariffs and rulings and FCC dockets that frustrate
the implementation of communications advances. With an acceleration of technology
and a tsunami of new Internet demand for bandwidth, this bottleneck is breaking
at last.<BR>
<BR>
Backbone capacity is leaping upward today. As TCP/IP coinventor Vinton Cerf
of MCI told Forbes ASAP in December, his company correctly predicted its
backbone bandwidth would increase from 45 megabits per second to 155 megabits
per second this year, or by a factor of nearly four. But on March 11, MCI
Vice-President of Enterprise Marketing Stephen VonRump told Gordon Cook
of the Cook Report on the Internet that MCI will jack up the speeds to 622
megabits per second before the end of the year, or nearly fifteenfold in
one year. Meanwhile, cable modems, telco Digital Subscriber Line technologies
(from HDSL to ADSL and SDSL) and digital wireless advances promise even
larger factors of expansion in the bandwidth to homes, though unlike the
backbone expansion, the impact will be incremental.<BR>
<BR>
Shaping the future, however, will be breakthroughs in laboratories. As &quot;Into
the Fibersphere&quot; maintained, the ultimate source of bandwidth expansion
is the immense capacity of optical fiber. Now comprising a global installed
base of 40 million miles (some 25 million miles in North America), each
optical fiber, as Paul Green of IBM estimated to Forbes ASAP four years
ago, commands an intrinsic available bandwidth of 25,000 gigahertz. At the
time, the world record transmission over a significant distance was still
approximately 20 gigabits per second, and the highest deployed capacity
was just 2.5 gigabits per second. Moreover, the light pulses had to be converted
to electronic pulses every 50 to 70 kilometers to amplify and regenerate
the signal. This electronic bottleneck restricted the speed of long-distance
transmission to the maximum speed of the optoelectronics, or some 10 gigahertz.
So Green's projections provoked incredulity in many quarters.<BR>
<BR>
Early this year, however, Green's visions were becoming more plausible.
On Feb. 26, 1996, at the conference on Optical Fiber Communication (OFC
'96) in San Jose, Calif., papers from Lucent Technologies' Bell Labs, Fujitsu
and NTT Labs all reported successful transmissions at a landmark rate of
a terabit per second, one twenty-fifth of Green's limit. For these terabit
rates, Fujitsu and Bell Labs used between 50 and 55 separate bitstreams
or wavelengths, each some 20 gigabits per second. NTT, which employed 10
separate bitstreams, also reported diffraction grating receivers that could
resolve 64 different wavelengths at once.<BR>
<BR>
At the same time, erbium-doped fiber amplifiers were smashing the electronic
bottleneck. Impelled by a pump laser (light amplification by stimulated
emission of radiation), these all-optical amplifiers are now being deployed
in networks around the world. They open a new era. Simple broadband amplifiers
made of a coiled fiber thread, they replace optoelectronic repeaters comprising
nine custom bipolar microchips that must be duplicated for every frequency
or modulation scheme used in the fiber. Thus the new amplifiers make possible
the creation of vast broadband fiber networks bearing hundreds or even thousands
of separate carriers, and permit the sending of thousands of separate messages
around the globe or under the seas entirely on wings of light. The bandwidth
of these all-optical amplifiers is now up to 4.5 terahertz, or close to
20% of Green's estimated limit.<BR>
<BR>
The ultimate capacity of fiber is not a merely academic issue. At a rate
of 4,000 miles a day, fiber deployment is beginning to make a dent in neighborhoods.
David Charlton of Corning estimates that over the past five years, the top
10% of U.S. households, comprising most of the early technology adopters,
have drastically improved their access to fiber. Five years ago these homes
were, on average, 1,000 households away from a fiber node; this year, they
are just 100 households away. Milo Medin of @Home estimates that 15% of
U.S. cable TV subscribers had systems directly connected to fiber nodes
at the beginning of 1996. By the end of the year, that number will be close
to one-third.<BR>
<BR>
Hostility to cable TV remains high and politically useful; many city governments
subsist on cable TV franchise fees and regulate these companies into a stupor.
Eerily mimicking computer experts of the 1960s who attested that telephone
wires were too beset with noise and interference to carry digital data,
telco experts today pronounce cable plant entirely unsuited for Internet
bits. But the fact remains that cable TV coax is the only truly broadband
link already in most U.S. homes.<BR>
<BR>
Flaws in the transmission of analog video, in which every glitch of interference
is visible on the screen, fall away in digital systems that can deliver
flawless images at a signal-to-noise ratio more than 1,000 times lower.
Directv, for example, does not outperform cable TV because it is harder
to send a signal a few thousand feet down a coaxial cable than to zap it
to a satellite 23,600 miles away, beam it to an 18-inch dish on a roof,
then send it down a coaxial cable to your TV. The superiority of Directv
derives from its digital nature. Essentially, the picture is created in
the set rather than at the station. Using a variety of new cable modems,
possibly including Cisco and Terayon's CDMA for upstream signals (CDMA finesses
interfering frequencies by spreading codes through them all), cable TV plant
will prove to be entirely adequate for digital transmissions, both upstream
and downstream.<BR>
<BR>
But what about switching, ask the critics of cable? Claude Shannon of mit
and Bell Labs, the inventor of information theory, had the answer in 1948:
Bandwidth is a replacement for switching. Rather than performing the processing
at some central point, you use routers in the Net and filters in the terminals.
If you have adequate bandwidth, you can emulate any switching topology you
want. Cable commands a potential of some 8 gigabits per second of two-way
bandwidth. Linked to the potential terabits of fiber bandwidth, cable plant
has as much chance of accommodating the explosive growth of the Internet
as the telcos do. <BR>
<BR>
The two essential models for the distribution of information are select
and switch or broadcast and select. Select and switch is based on intelligence
in central servers that search databases for desired material, and on intelligence
in switches that channel the material to the desired address. Select and
switch uses computer power at the servers and switches to compensate for
the lack of bandwidth on the network and the lack of storage and processing
power in the terminals. By contrast, broadcast and select is based on bandwidth
in the network and on intelligence and storage in the terminals. <BR>
<BR>
Envisaging video servers, information warehouses and other centralized schemes,
select and switch is the model pursued by much of the industry today. In
some schemes, agents from networked terminals search through large banks
of data looking for specified items, which are switched through the network
to the terminals. Computers reach out and grab data they need from servers
with large storage facilities.<BR>
<BR>
Epitomized by the World Wide Web today, the marvels of this select-and-switch
model are evident to us all. It is far superior for personal two-way communications
and one-to-one file transfers. But it is not superior for everything, as
companies trying to send movies point-to-point over ATM switches discovered
in Orlando and elsewhere. The success of select and switch, using the storage
of servers, has been too total for the health of the Internet.<BR>
<BR>
In its extreme form, select and switch contravenes the laws of the microcosm
and telecosm. These laws will increase storage at the terminals far faster
than at the centralized server and will expand the network's bandwidth faster
than its switching capability. For many uses, the broadcast-and-select method
is appropriate--indeed, inevitable--and its spread will relieve many of
the pressures on Internet capacity.<BR>
<BR>
Broadcast and select is the system used in wavelength division multiplexing
systems in the new multi-bitstream terabit-per-second fiber tests. Broadcast
and select conforms closely with the strengths of the cable system. In late
April, for example, Wave Systems (where I serve as a director) launched
its Cablepc project in the heart of Silicon Valley with the Palo Alto Cable
Co-op. Supporting the test are 26 other companies with equipment and services,
including cable modems from Com21 and En Technology; a merchandising engine
from Zero.one; the Destination PC/TV from Gateway 2000; game machines from
mak Technologies; and content from Simon &amp; Schuster Interactive, Network
News, William Morris Agency, Microsoft's interactive software arm and an
array of CD-ROM publishers. <BR>
<BR>
This system uses cable bandwidth to broadcast huge amounts of digital information
and entertainment. Originating anywhere from the World Wide Web and Directv
satellites to CD-ROMs on a PC, the rush of bits will be filtered and downloaded
by the PC at the programmable specifications of the viewer. Customers pay
for material by the piece and only when they choose to decrypt it through
an onboard &quot;credit chip&quot; or WaveMeter that may be periodically
tapped over telephone lines from a transaction center. Rather than millions
of people downloading new versions of Netscape one at a time over 28.8 modems,
for example, you can program your machine to download all new Netscape browser
releases to your hard drive when they are broadcast, probably late at night.
The next day you can decide whether to buy, save or delete the program.
Explains new Wave Systems president Steven Sprague, &quot;This system creates
a new channel where the customer pays only for what is used, when it is
used, and the owner of intellectual property benefits from each use.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Together with systems of mirroring, replicating and local buffering being
pioneered by @Home, the Cablepc project is one of many ways to use cable
bandwidth to relieve pressure on the Net and to exploit the ever-rising
intelligence and storage in the terminals. Other broadcast-and-select systems
include PointCast for the PC, which uses the screensaver as a way to display
programmably filtered news and other information. Another large contribution
of broadcast-and-select bandwidth for the WWW will come from digital satellite
systems, such as Directv, that devote channels to Internet services.<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, coming to the rescue of the Net backbone are an array of technologies
incorporating asynchronous transfer mode (ATM), an elaborate set of standards
for broadband switching. Supported by some 800 companies in the ATM Forum,
ATM resembles RISC (reduced instruction set computer), which accelerates
speeds by making all instructions the same length and processing them in
silicon. Similarly, ATM breaks all data into 53 byte cells, small enough
to be processed in a semiconductor chip at speeds fast enough to accept
voice, video or data at once. Conceived as an end-to-end system from your
phone or PC through the &quot;cloud&quot; to your Internet service provider
and beyond, ATM seems a panacea for the protocol zoo emerging in data communications.<BR>
<BR>
ATM to the desktop faces dire challenges, however. Paul Green noticed that
the most popular booth at the early May ATM Year '96 conference in San Jose
was by a company called Ipsilon. Now partnering with Hitachi, Ipsilon makes
an IP switch that dispenses with all ATM software and uses ATM cells only
for fast hardware switching. Similarly, NetStar [see Forbes ASAP, &quot;Angst
and Awe on the Internet,&quot; Dec. 4, 1995], now being purchased by Ascend
Communications for $300 million in stock, offers an IP crossbar switch in
gallium arsenide with a backplane throughput of 16 gigabits per second.
Meanwhile, vendors of Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet attracted increasing
attention. Why transform your network when you can get most of the advantages
of ATM through new forms of Ethernet and TCP/IP? But in one form or another,
ATM switches are still the fastest switches and use their advantage in silicon
integration to dominate the top-of-the-line slots in the backbone of the
Internet.<BR>
<BR>
<B>REVENGE OF BEARDS AND BIRKENSTOCKS</B><BR>
<BR>
The readers of Forbes ASAP will recall Gordon Jacobson and Avi Freedman,
East Coast ISPs who have graced these pages contemplating a national network.
Tonight, in New York, they are debating the future of the Net with each
other and with two executives from a San Diego company called AtmNet who
have similar ambitions. I am there to get a view from the pits of the Internet
on Metcalfe's lament. Jacobson has a problem, though. He wants to take us
to Le Colonial on East 57th Street, which he describes as the hottest bar
and best French-Vietnamese restaurant in the city. But the bearded Avi Freedman
has shown up in a green T-shirt and Birkenstock sandals, which won't cut
it at Le Colonial.<BR>
<BR>
A second-floor hideaway, Le Colonial looks like Rick's place in Casablanca,
so they say, and it sounds like a bar on the Champs-Elysees. More important
to guru Gordon, it allows him to flaunt a tycoon's cigar, unlike P.J. Clarke's,
his other favored haunt, which has succumbed to nicotine correctness since
Dan Jenkins's novel on the Giants, Semi-Tough, celebrated its smoke and
grit. Unlike P.J. Clarke's with its elderly Irish trolls, Gordon tells us,
Le Colonial offers &quot;the most beautiful bartender in all New York. You
got to see her.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Avi, though, has more important things on his mind. Polynomials.<BR>
<BR>
They're a dilemma, those polynomials. But Gordon decides to act anyway.
We will start out with dinner at Clarke's and then move on to Le Colonial
for after-dinner drinks. At the bar, Le Colonial will tolerate the T-shirt,
and perhaps, with adequate lubrication, we will be able to relieve the pressure
of the polynomials.<BR>
<BR>
The Internet is in the process of a horizontal explosion, with new network
exchange points popping up everywhere--two in L.A., one each in Tucson,
Phoenix, Atlanta, Cincinnati--you name it, a hundred or more network exchange
facilities coming online. AtmNet is beginning one in San Diego and has plans
to participate in those in L.A.<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, the P.J. Clarke's waiter, delivering salad with home fries well
done and a Diet Pepsi, is struggling with the demands of serving different
meals to five customers (that's 25 different possibilities). With mental
buffers overflowing and packet losses mounting, he resolves on a polling
algorithm, offering the plate to each of us around the table before settling
on Avi. Gordon is looking worried; Avi is questioning his confidence that
ATM switching can resolve most of the complexity problems on the Internet.<BR>
<BR>
<B>SEX AND POLYNOMIALS AT LE COLONIAL</B><BR>
<BR>
I ask whether the problem arises from scanty RAM buffers in the Cisco routers.
Avi says no. An entire global routing table still takes just 14 megabytes
and virtually everyone on the Net can now handle that. Soon they will be
able to handle a gigabyte of routes, no sweat, enough to deal with any foreseeable
growth of the Net. Yes, I observe, it's exponential; I talk about it all
the time. No, Avi corrects me, complexity growth is not exponential. It
is polynomial.<BR>
<BR>
This problem will have to wait, however, says Gordon, hailing the waiter.
It's time to leave for Le Colonial. Gordon wants Jim Browning and John Mevi
of AtmNet to explain how their ATM systems can transcend all these complexities.<BR>
<BR>
AtmNet is visiting New York to consult with Gordon and Avi about AtmNet's
plans to create a new national 155-megabit backbone across the country.
AtmNet already has a 155-megabit-per-second backbone on the West Coast connecting
San Diego, L.A. and San Francisco. But they are dependent on the caprices
of long-distance carriers to cross the country. Gordon pays the waiter and
we're off to Le Colonial.<BR>
<BR>
After dinner, Avi's T-shirt and sandals pass. But upon arrival, Gordon is
crestfallen: The exponential bartender is off for the night. When Gordon
recovers, we all troop to a table in the corner. Thronging the room are
models in miniskirts--tall, lithe and pneumatic. Across the table, in front
of a large framed photograph with a wraithlike image of Ho Chi Minh in a
Huey Newton chair, a sleek young couple in black hungrily writhes through
hot kisses. A sultry Asian waitress in a red kimono blouse emerges from
behind palm leaves to take orders of port, Courvoisier and Diet Pepsi. Avi
is worried that we still don't get his point about the polynomials.<BR>
<BR>
He wants to correct me: Strictly speaking it is not exponential (that's
when the exponent rises), it is polynomial (the variable n rises). In this
case, the complexity of the network rises by n nodes times n-1, which is
not even quite the square of n. I got it. The growth of Internet complexity
is polynomial. But the growth curve still rises toward the sky, okay?<BR>
<BR>
Avi ignores my comment and cruises on. Cisco is selling 60,000 routers a
month. It's the low end of the Net that is exploding. Hierarchical segmentation
through routers is the answer, reducing the n squared factor to the logarithm
of n. &quot;Log n is wonderful,&quot; Avi says. &quot;It shears off complexity.&quot;
The curves are relatively flat. But what about Metcalfe's prediction of
a whopping Internet crash in 1996? Avi will get to that. And what is the
role of AtmNet's ATM switches?<BR>
<BR>
Indeed. Apparently joining Avi in ignoring these tantalizing questions,
the girl across the table raises her legs and hooks them sinuously around
the body of the sleek young man. The waitress leans forward to deliver the
drinks, suffusing the table with exotic perfumes. The two AtmNet promoters
insist that the router problem can be overcome through the interposition
of ATM switches.<BR>
<BR>
Avi dismisses the ATM argument. The complexity curve is still polynomial,
he says. Whether routed or switched, the messages have to follow the same
physical routes. The complexity is the same. Moreover, Avi's cell phone
is on the blink and he has been out of reach for three hours. Gordon offers
a show-off Audiovox the size of a pack of cards, only lighter. Avi manages
to put through a call.<BR>
<BR>
The girl across the table shudders with pleasure as the man reaches out
and cups her breasts in his hands. &quot;The FIX is down,&quot; Avi sighs.
&quot;What does that mean?&quot; I ask. That means, so I learn, a 45-megabit
line is out of service and the Federal Internet Exchange, a Washington NAP,
cannot trade routes or data with MAE East, Metropolitan Fiber Systems's
Fiber Distributed Data Interface exchange point in Vienna, Virginia. This
glitch ramifies, creating certain problems for some of Avi's new customers
in Washington. The young man whispers something in the ear of the girl.
She balks. &quot;No, I'm getting embarrassed,&quot; she says. &quot;Let's
leave.&quot; &quot;I'll call back in 10 minutes,&quot; says Avi. The pair
unwrap their entangled limbs and staggers up from the table. Avi and the
rest of us get up to go.<BR>
<BR>
Thus ends the visit to the palmy domain of Le Colonial. Before I can pry
in a question about Metcalfe, Avi is on the road back home to his wife and
an Internet crisis at 11 p.m., enjoying life as a Diet Pepsi bon vivant
polynomial ISP. Anyway, it was time for fresh air. John Mevi of AtmNet needs
a break. &quot;Avi talks so fast it makes my ears ring,&quot; he explains.
&quot;You've got to understand. I'm from a telco environment.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
So it was that on a steamy evening in New York, on June 17, I returned to
consult Avi again on Metcalfe's predictions of a network crash. We met with
Gordon Jacobson at Martini's, an Italian restaurant near the Sheraton Hotel
on the west side of Manhattan. While Avi and Gordon consume a lox pizza
and several orders of pasta, I question these men who live on the Net from
minute to minute, day to day, who live in a world of routing tables, TCP/IP
address resolutions, and BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) and Gate Daemons,
about what they make of the doom scenario.<BR>
<BR>
Avi believes that Metcalfe has ascended to an elevation in the industry
that takes him out of the loop. He really doesn't get it. The Merit data
is mostly irrelevant. Pings from the Routing Arbiter are weighted as lowest-priority
packets. It is predictable and unimportant that many are dropped and re-sent.
&quot;That's the way the Internet works. Like Ethernet, it is tolerant of
failure. Undelivered packets are re-sent; they show up as a few milliseconds
of delay.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Metcalfe makes much of Merit's index of router instability, measured by
the number of routes announced and withdrawn. In the extreme, instability
brings &quot;route flaps,&quot; in which waves of announcements and withdrawals
spread across the Net in positive feedback loops that congest the system.
Avi dismisses this effect. &quot;There have been no significant route flaps
in the last six months or more.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
A large portion of the instability problems is attributable to a bug in
Cisco router software that is in the process of being fixed. He confirms
the findings of Ken Ehrhart of Gilder Technology Group that shows little
correlation between the router instability number and performance of the
Net measured by throughput at NAP switches. While all this &quot;wild statistical
behavior&quot; went on, the Net continued to perform stably by using other
routes, circumventing the congested paths. &quot;That's how the Internet
works.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Avi sums it up: &quot;Metcalfe has become an elder statesman and now he
is doing more harm than good, spreading fear and doubt while the rest of
us solve the problems.&quot; As Ehrhart puts it, &quot;These Merit numbers
bear bad names like 'instability,' 'packet loss' and 'delay.' Metcalfe says
these bad things are growing wildly. But in back of these numbers what is
really growing wildly is the Internet and that is a good thing.&quot; Richard
Shaffer's ComputerLetter, for example, reports that MCI's backbone traffic
has risen fivefold in the last year. MCI reports that its traffic has grown
a total of 5,000% since it opened the backbone in 1994.<BR>
<BR>
Like Howard Anderson, Bill Gates, Andy Grove and other bandwidth skeptics,
Metcalfe seems to find the explosive growth of his intellectual progeny--Ethernets
and Internets--too good to be true. All the sages and titans seem to seek
obsessively the worms in the Giant Peach as it hurtles through the air.
The message from Avi, Gordon and the AtmNet crew is &quot;Let them eat worms.
We'll feast on the peach.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Metcalfe's economics arguments are largely true. As Michael Rothschild's
Bionomics shows, growth in natural and economic systems depends on running
a surplus in every cell. But the cells of the Internet are thriving today.
From the creators of the backbone who lease their facilities, to the ISPs
who are madly multiplying their points of presence, the leading companies
are attracting so much investment and support that laggard behemoths such
as AT&amp;T, TCI and the RBOCs are rushing in.<BR>
<BR>
The law of the telecosm depends on the principle that new computers and
routers on the Net not only use its resources but also contribute new resources
to it. If the recent upsurge in Intranets is parasitical to some degree
(because these newcomers use the resources of the Net without contributing
resources of their own), the ultimate parasite on the scene may be AT&amp;T,
which commands perhaps the world's largest Intranet.<BR>
<BR>
AT&amp;T has attracted some 6 million orders from newcomers for Net service,
with plans to have 20 million by the end of the year, while lagging far
behind MCI and Sprint in contributing to the Internet system. Until recently,
AT&amp;T's vast fiber backbones carried just 2% of Internet traffic. AT&amp;T
preens as the largest and lowest-cost ISP, but its traffic mostly travels
the backbones of MCI, Sprint and other national Internet carriers. A key
to clearing the current bogs and bit pits of the Internet and preventing
a Metcalfe collapse is the enlisting of the full-fiber and switching resources
of AT&amp;T to relieve the pressure on the existing NAPs and backbones and
to accommodate the Internet's growth. AT&amp;T is currently moving to supply
such support.<BR>
<BR>
The Intranets criticized by Metcalfe are crucial to the Internet's growth.
Like the corporate PCs that spearheaded the advance of PC technology, Intranets
spread Internet technology through business, expand the market for high-powered
gear, lower component prices, enlarge bandwidth, and bring new users and
buyers onto the Net.<BR>
<BR>
As for Metcalfe's prediction of Internet crashes from private network overflows,
the fact is that no computer memory system could work without the principle
of locality--the tendency of memory accesses to focus on a contiguous region
of addresses. The Internet is similar. Internal corporate e-mail, for example,
is about 10 times as voluminous as remote e-mail. Metcalfe's private Net
overflow cascade is mostly a theoretical chimera. Like Ethernets, &quot;the
Internet works in practice but not in theory.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
A second key fact of the Internet is that nothing in modern computer systems
could survive the combinatorial explosions of multimillion-line software
programs and multimillion-node circuitry without the magic of the microcosm.
Semiconductors sink the complexity into silicon, where it gives way to the
exponential boon of the power-delay product. The performance of the circuit--measured
by its speed and low power--improves roughly by the square of the number
of transistors on the chip.<BR>
<BR>
A microprocessor using separate components would be taller than the Empire
State Building and cover most of New York state. Most of the problems of
Internet complexity must be solved the same way that the microprocessor
solves its complexity explosion, sucking the complexity into semiconductors
and taming it on the chip. This means that Internet nodes would ideally
be single-chip systems. Avi is correct; it makes little difference whether
these systems are routers or switches. Today the backbone is being renewed
by ATM switches because these devices integrate more of the process onto
silicon than any other switches. In the future, broadband optics will likely
prevail by integrating entire communications systems onto seamless webs
of glass.<BR>
<BR>
<B>THE INTERNET AS LIFE EXTENDER</B><BR>
<BR>
The internet is a human contrivance requiring finance and physical renewal.
In practice, this means capital from phone companies and other large institutions.
In the real world, self-organizing systems rely on market incentives rather
than bio-analogies. Metcalfe is right that these incentives must be protected
and extended in order for the law of the telecosm to conquer the laws of
entropy.<BR>
<BR>
The key remaining obstacle to the fulfillment of the promise of the Internet
is government regulation. This obstacle is being overcome at last by the
brute force of bandwidth abundance, stemming from breakthroughs in fiber
optics, smart radios, satellites and cable modems.<BR>
<BR>
In every industrial transformation, businesses prosper by using the defining
abundance of their era to alleviate the defining scarcity. Today this challenge
implies a commanding moral imperative: to use Internet bandwidth in order
to stop wasting the customer's time. Stop the callous cost of queues, the
insolence of cold calls, the wanton eyeball pokes and splashes of billboards
and unwanted ads, the constant drag of lowest-common-denominator entertainments,
the lethal tedium of unneeded travel, the plangent buffeting of TV news
and political prattle, the endless temporal dissipation in classrooms, waiting
rooms, anterooms, traffic jams, toll booths and assembly lines, through
the impertinent tyranny of unneeded and afterwards ignored submission of
forms, audits, polls, waivers, warnings, legal pettifoggery.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<IMG SRC="warn-stripe-4.gif" WIDTH="450" HEIGHT="4" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"
ALIGN="BOTTOM"><BR>
<BR>
PB: In the recent past, your ideas and writings have enraged feminists and
political liberals. Today, those ideas seem to be among the guiding principles
of a changed political climate in Washington. We're going to ask you to
summarize the major themes of your books. But, for starters, just what is
it you believe in?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I believe in a free capitalist sys-tem in a larger cosmic order,
founded on absolute truth. I believe there are such things as absolute truths
and that society will necessarily reflect those truths, over time, in its
organization and behavior.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Tell us an absolute truth.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: An absolute truth I pro-pound in Wealth And Poverty is &quot;Give
and you will be given unto.&quot; To the extent people are willing to give
of themselves, to devote themselves to pursuits beyond their own immediate
cal-culations of self-interest, they tend to be more successful, to contribute
more to society and to receive more benefits themselves.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Then you don't see self-interest as the basis of economic progress?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: No. I don't think &quot;rational self-interest&quot; is the foundation
of capitalism or of economic growth under any circumstances. I think economic
growth is the result of human creativ-ity -- and creativity always comes
as a surprise to us. <BR>
<BR>
To the extent you plan for progress or growth, you will tend to exclude
the creative surprises on which growth and achievement depend. Surprises
mainly derive from the willingness of people to devote themselves to causes
beyond themselves -- to give of their work and wealth to create busi-nesses
or art, to project their energies beyond their own personal needs and perceptions.
This is a generous impulse. It leads to ever-widening circles of human sympathy.
<BR>
<BR>
A new project -- any new economic activity -- will succeed only to the extent
that it responds to the needs of others. The effort to fulfill the needs
of others is essential to important achievement.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Your altruistic notion of capi-talism certainly doesn't conform to the
conventional leftist view of the capital-ist as a predatory, money-grubbing,
self-interested individual.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That is a caricature of capitalism. Of course, in any society, there
are going to be self-interested, predatory, rapacious people -- and such
people have a lot of room to display their wares in a free society. But
this doesn't mean the essence of capitalism -- that part of it that accounts
for its unique success in creat-ing wealth -- is rapacious, predatory, or
self-interested. <BR>
<BR>
One of the themes of my book -- I'm talking about Wealth And Poverty --
is that this image doesn't work very well. When the leftist says that capitalists
are a bunch of creeps and predators, and the defender of capital-ism says,
&quot;Yes, but look what marvelous effects their freedom produces,&quot;
the left-ist has won the argument. The average per-son just won't believe
that, by giving maximum freedom to a bunch of creeps and predators, you
are going to produce a steadily improving human condition.<BR>
<BR>
And, as a result, the argument for moral-ity in human affairs has increasingly
shifted to the left. You find the Pope assuming, as a matter of course,
that socialism is a more generous and com-passionate way of organizing human
affairs.<BR>
<BR>
PB: And you?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I think that individuals who pur-sue only their narrow self-interest
are led, &quot;as by an invisible hand,&quot; toward an ever greater welfare
state. The truth is that people pursuing rational self-interest demand comfort
and security; they don't take the risks that result in growth and achievement.
And, without the risk-derived surprises of human creativity, the human race
is doomed. <BR>
<BR>
You need a willingness to give of your time and wealth and effort without
a predetermined reward. You hope for a reward in the future but, in capitalism,
that reward is not specified beforehand. You make your investment without
any assurance you will be commensurately repaid, let alone heavily rewarded.
<BR>
<BR>
This willing-ness to take risks is crucial to master the unpredictable and
unknown future.<BR>
<BR>
PB: And you believe that relates to how men perform in society, don't you?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes, because in a free society, men will be inclined to take such
risks. This is what men do when they're al-lowed to -- it's part of the
masculine character. Boys grow up and they want to perform. Their performances
are appraised by others. They fight to per-form well. And I think this desire
to perform, which has to some extent a sexual foundation, leads to the creative
activities so dramatically shown in capi-talist societies.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What is that sexual foundation? <BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Men have to perform in order to please women in a way that women
don't have to perform in order to please men. When you ask the average man
why he works, he'll pull out his wallet and show you a picture of his wife
and kids.<BR>
<BR>
PB: But don't men also work to impress other men -- their peers?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Sure, but that makes my point as well. Young men have to undergo
all kinds of initiation rites among their peers, in the outside world, in
order to qualify for manhood. Young girls don't have those rites. The changes
in their bodies qualify them for the crucial role of motherhood and the
survival of the tribe. There is a consistent differ-ence between this male
need for exter-nal performance to qualify for manhood and the degree to
which biological changes qualify women for their roles.<BR>
<BR>
PB: That was the controversial theme of one of your earlier books, wasn't
it?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Partly. The main thesis of Sexual Suicide is that sex roles are
the founda-tion of civilized society and any society that attempts to repress
them will at the same time subvert civilization. <BR>
I maintain that sex roles are founded on evolutionary experience, on the
mil-lions of years humans spent in hunter-gatherer societies; [and] that
they are further reaffirmed by the biological differences between the sexes,
which it takes a Ph.D. in physiology to ignore and which are evident to
all of us when we examine them. Further, I believe those differences are
affirmed by the dra-matically differing sexual experiences in men and women.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Namely?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Male experience revolves around copulation as the one purely sexual
activity. Women experience copulation as only one of a long series of sexual
experiences running from pregnancy to childbirth to breast-feeding and nurtur-ing
small children. Because women have this extended pattern of sexual experi-ences
that affirm them as women, they have great difficulty comprehending the
much more compulsive, aggressive and anxious male attitude toward the sex
act itself and toward sexual identity. Men have to earn their sexual identity
while, for women, it's part of their very being. <BR>
<BR>
As Margaret Mead wrote, ''Motherhood is a biological fact, while fatherhood
is a social invention.&quot; The father doesn't even have to be around when
the baby is born. He will be around, and be acknowledged as the fa-ther,
only to the extent the woman is willing to affirm his paternity -- to the
extent, in fact, that the woman is willing to forgo other sexual liaisons.
<BR>
This may be less true today than it was in the past. But certainly, through
the entire evolutionary experience of the race, fatherhood could be maintained
as a real institution only to the extent the woman was prevented from sleeping
around.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Sometimes called the double standard?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Right. I don't particularly want to defend the double standard as
a far-reaching moral principle, but it certainly does derive from the very
differing consequences of promiscuity for men and for women.<BR>
<BR>
PB: We'll get down to cases on that topic but, for now, what was your purpose
in writing Sexual Suicide?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I wrote that book because I saw that, until you understood the difference
between the sexes, you couldn't under-stand the effects of government welfare
policy on the poor. It was obvious to me how, to the extent that welfare
programs usurped the male role of provider, it would be impossible to maintain
intact families. And, as long as intact families were not maintained, it
would be impos-sible for the wide range of welfare recipients ever to escape
from the wel-fare society.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What was the theme of your subsequent book?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: The concept for my subsequent book, Naked Nomads, came to me dur-ing
a debate, when my opponent was talking about how women earn less money,
how they have all these signs of oppression and victimization -- where-upon
it occurred to me that single men could be presented in exactly the same
terms. Single men earn about the same amount of money as single women of
the same age and qualifications. They are enormously more prone to every
sort of disease and affliction than any other large group in the society.
And they commit something like 90% of all the violent crimes. It seemed
to me the statistics about single men had real significance for an appraisal
of the dif-ferent roles of the sexes.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Single women didn't manifest those tendencies?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That's right. Single women are virtually as healthy and as well
paid as married women, by most indices, while married men earn almost twice
as much money as single men of the same age and qualifications. The obvious
question that arose about this data was whether it was merely that single
men were losers, and therefore couldn't get married, or whether failure
to get married led to a pattern of behavior that fostered disease and criminality.
<BR>
<BR>
I pored through lots of evidence on this point and discovered that widowed
men and divorced men showed a pattern of problems almost identical to those
displayed by single men of the same age and qualifications. Widowed men
didn't choose to be wid-owed, and divorced men may or may not have chosen
to be divorced, but my thesis was that single men are less civi-lized, if
you will. They have more short-term perspectives, because they lack the
links to women and children that lend them a sense of the future -- a kind
of physical embodiment of the future in their lives. Single men, lacking
these long-term dimensions, are left in the very short-term compulsive circuits
of male sexuality. They follow the same patterns of tension and release
that are characteristic of the male sexual experi-ence. Man's link to the
future passes through the woman's womb. Men be-come more stable and less
compulsive to the extent that they have links to chil-dren that carry them
into the future. I thought the statistics about single men -- whether bachelors,
widowers or divorced -- confirmed that proposition.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You seem to be saying that the success of the human race depends on
men's becoming what used to be called -- mostly in bars and locker rooms
-- &quot;pussy-whipped.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: This is one of the great ironies of male chauvinism. Men always
use such terms to the extent they are ex-cluded from the long-term patterns
of family life that women tend to foster. Men asserting male superiority
feel compelled to put down women. The sort of male-chauvinist idiom you
find at bars or in all-male groups, particu-larly in the military, really
reflects an inner sense of the profound dependency of men on women for the
most important of human experiences: Procreation and nurture.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What was your book Visible Man about?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Visible Man began with the title Sam Beau. It was based on two years
of interviews with ghetto blacks. My thesis was that the old &quot;Sambo&quot;
image -- the Stepin Fetchit character that was the previous destructive
clich&eacute; about black life -- had been supplanted on the streets by
a new &quot;Sam Beau&quot; image -- of the swashbuckling street stud, who
didn't work and who spent all his time pursuing a succession of welfare
mothers and engaging in criminal activity. <BR>
<BR>
The pimp image was strikingly manifest in ghetto culture, and my observation
was that this image is just as destructive to people who succumb to it as
the previous, self-indulgent Sambo image. This conduct also resembled the
male behavior in various societies I studied in anthropology, in which the
constructive male role of provider is not pursued for one reason or another.
In the ghetto, the chief reason the male-provider role is unavailable is
that it's performed so much better by the gov-ernment through the welfare
state. <BR>
<BR>
Those were the ideas that underlay the narrative of Visible Man -- which
is, in fact, a nonfiction novel, examining the welfare culture and what
it does to men: How it destroys men and drives them into increasingly futile
virility rites -- fighting and crime and drugs.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You're not suggesting that this is exclusively a black problem, are
you?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Not at all. It s not a special black problem. It's only a black
problem because the welfare culture has been propagated most successfully
in the in-ner cities, through the War on Poverty, which focused on blacks
in the ghetto. The same sort of patterns can also be found in hippie culture,
where you have the violent flower-child phenomenon in a social order that
was just as corrupting as the street culture of blacks in the ghetto itself.
<BR>
<BR>
Middle-class black society is very much like middle-class white society.
Black families are no more prone to breakdown than are white families. And
white families break down just as much when subjected to this kind of welfare
state as black families do. <BR>
<BR>
It just happens that, through the Outreach programs of the War on Poverty,
a much higher proportion of the black poor was induced to accept the welfare
culture.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Do you find no redeeming features in the War on Poverty? You seem to
indict the program totally.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Pretty much. It just didn't do any good. The various well-intentioned
programs might have done some good, if they hadn't been accompanied by a
vast increase in welfare benefits that just ravaged the families of the
sup-posed beneficiaries. The crucial thing that happened during that period
-- that overwhelmed every positive initiative of the War on Poverty -- was
the doubling of the number of female-headed families among blacks. This
meant almost a complete breakdown of the black family in the ghetto itself,
to the extent that 95% of black welfare families lack fathers.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What is the theme of your latest book?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Wealth And Poverty brings all these social themes together with
an economic vision. Present in Wealth And Poverty is the idea that the competitive
activity of men, attempting to support their families, is a crucial impulse
of economic growth. <BR>
<BR>
I also stress the criti-cal importance of freedom as a practical necessity
for economic progress in an uncertain and unpredictable world. The creative
breakthroughs I talked about earlier -- the surprises that throughout human
history have been most important in creating wealth and solving the problems
of scarcity -- have never been predicted. They tend to emerge in defiance
of the assumptions of the experts. <BR>
<BR>
Creativity is always unexpected. After all, if you could predict it, you
could prescribe it. If it were predictable, you wouldn't need it. And, because
existing knowledge and ex-isting resources are always inadequate to an extended
future, human success is necessarily dependent on novelty, on surprise,
on creativity. You have to have a huge outpouring of human creativity in
order to launch the few unpredict-able inventions that can transform all
human life. <BR>
<BR>
Consider the vast number of small businesses that are conceived against
the relatively tiny number that are actually launched. When you realize
that two-thirds of these will fail within five years, you understand how
the process is not a matter of very profound rational planning.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What specific message in Wealth And Poverty do you think the Reagan
Administration finds so compelling?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well, one of them is that the fun-damental problem of American society
today is that more than half the people in the country now face marginal
tax rates above 50% on an additional dollar of earnings.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Explain what you mean by the marginal tax rate.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: The marginal tax rate is the tax you pay on the next dollar you
earn, beyond your current earnings. It's what you don't take home from your
next dol-lar of income. That's the marginal tax rate and, as I say, it has
now reached a level over 50% for most Americans, which includes all the
most productive Americans, who really determine the directions of our economic
activity.<BR>
<BR>
It also includes welfare recipients. They have very high marginal tax rates.
If a welfare mother goes out and earns an additional dollar, she'll have
to forgo a dollar of her current income -- plus some leisure time. In effect,
she faces a margin-al tax rate of more than 100%. The same is true for people
who are much better off, who face preposterous rates on interest earned
from savings -- which the government quaintly calls &quot;unearned income.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The tax rates on such income are ostensibly 70%, but they end up, after
adjusting for inflation, attaining real levels much over 100% -- often 200%
or even 300%.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Would you elaborate on that?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: If you put $100 into a savings account, you'll be lucky to get 10%
interest over a year's time. But, during that year, your principal has been
reduced by 10% inflation; so, at the end of the year, you break even. The
government doesn't see it that way. It says you've made $10 just by leav-ing
your money in the bank -- and it wants seven of them. So you started with
$100 and wind up, in effect, with $93. Here you're being taxed on losses.
<BR>
<BR>
Whether you're a welfare mother or a capitalist, this situation means you
have a greater incentive to hide a dollar of existing income than to earn
an addi-tional dollar. And that is the perfect formula for a tax system
that, on the margin, loses more revenue than it col-lects. It loses partly
by driving people into the underground economy, which consists of cash exchanges
and barter -- you know, where the accountant does the lawyer's taxes and
the lawyer does the accountant's divorce. Barter arrange-ments like that
are emerging increasingly in today's highly taxed economy. <BR>
<BR>
Tax revenue is also lost because people are driven into overseas tax havens,
or out of productive forms of investment and into postage stamps or boxcars
or rare coins or Rembrandts -- [and] all other non--financial assets whose
sole advantage is that they escape taxation most of the time.<BR>
<BR>
PB: But tax cuts at the margin will primarily benefit the rich. That used
to be called the &quot;trickle-down&quot; school of economics: Give money
to the rich and some of it will eventually trickle down to the poor. Is
that what supply-side eco-nomics is all about?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: No. Supply-side economics is the opposite of the trickle-down theory.
We believe that wealth is created by production -- at any level. That's
why you don't find supply-side theorists advocating tax cuts chiefly for
business. We focus on personal income tax cuts, because we be-lieve wealth
begins with individuals, not with institutions. Wealth is the product of
individual creativity.<BR>
<BR>
PB: There are certainly other visions of how economies are structured.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: To be sure. An alternate approach to taxation, which has dominated
in the United States in recent years and which still dominates in Sweden
and England, is the idea that you can have flourishing capitalism by subsidizing
big corporations while bitterly punishing anybody who tries to make money
outside the existing corporate structure. You subsidize institutional savings
that are channeled back into major corporations or into govern-ment bonds,
but you strongly prevent anyone from accumulating savings on his own that
he can dispose of as he wishes.<BR>
 <BR>
The problem with this approach is that, overwhelmingly, it is disposable
personal savings that make the economy go -- by financing the proliferation
of small busi-nesses, which are the source of ferment and growth. Supply-siders
focus on personal activity as the source of wealth. <BR>
<BR>
As an example, we believe immi-grants are one of the most important forces
in economic growth. They come to the country with no wealth, they generate
wealth and stimulate the lower middle class to greater efforts. This causes
wealth not to trickle down but really to surge up through the whole system.
It starts as much at the bottom as at the top. There's no trickle-down notion
at all in our ideal.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You talk about stimulating small businesses, but isn't most of the wealth
in this country in -- and there-fore aren't most jobs dependent on -- large
corporations?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Since the mid-fifties, the num-ber of small-business starts [annually]
has risen from 93,000 to nearly 500,000. There are a total of 15,000,000
small businesses in this country that create about 80% of new jobs. In fact,
during the '70s, companies with fewer than 250 employees created more than
90% of new jobs, while corporations in the Fortune top 1000 created no new
net employment at all.<BR>
 <BR>
There's no evidence that innovations come from big bureaucracies. Perhaps
the most impor-tant innovation of our time -- the micro-processor, the computer
on a chip -- was developed by a firm with 12 employees.<BR>
<BR>
PB: No innovations from bureauc-racies? NASA, so we hear repeatedly, gave
us Teflon. Bell Labs gave us the transistor.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Sure, but when you talk about Bell Labs, you find they're not prepared
to exploit the developments -- William Shockley left Bell Labs alter inventing
the transistor to start his own firm, when it became clear &quot;Ma Bell&quot;
didn't know how to use it. Similarly, Shockley didn't see how the transistor
could be transformed into a microprocessor, so some of his employees split
off from him to form yet another small business. <BR>
<BR>
As to NASA, that was primarily a case of mobilizing existing technology,
and the payoff was hardly worth the huge ex-pense. Statistics show the yield
of innovations from small businesses is about 20 times greater than that
from large corporations or subsidized research and development.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Is the Kemp/Roth tax bill -- which would reduce rates 30% over three
years -- a direct attempt to resolve the problem of excessive taxes at the
margin?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes. The Kemp/Roth bill was the original supply-side proposal.<BR>
<BR>
PB: The objection one hears most frequently is that the Kemp/Roth tax cuts
are certain to be inflationary, be-cause they would create a situation in
which too much money is chasing too few goods.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: But we don't focus on money. We focus on the creation of goods.
And we think that the problem of too much money is best addressed by enhancing
incentive to create more goods. There-fore, the way to respond to inflation
is not to diminish the amount of money people have but, rather, to enhance
the number of goods and services they produce. The best way to enhance their
incentives to create more goods and services is to reduce the tax rates
on traditional income. This is an excellent reason for supporting the Kemp/Roth
concept. <BR>
<BR>
PB: Would Kemp/Roth also stim-ulate savings?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: It would greatly stimulate savings, because a high marginal tax
rate deters savings twice: It first deters you from earning those additional
dollars you're most likely to save, and it then deters you from saving them
by taxing the interest return from savings at the highest possible rates.
So, when you cut marginal tax rates, you impart a double stimulus to savings
but only a single stimulus to consumption. <BR>
<BR>
Increased sav-ings don't enhance aggregate demand, even in the Keynesian
scheme. So, to the degree that a cut in marginal tax rates stimulates savings,
it has an anti-inflationary effect. If we expand savings by a greater amount
than we increase the federal deficit, we will actually reduce inflationary
pressures.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Has that been proved?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Absolutely. This is why the Japa-nese and Germans and Swiss have
been able to run deficits two or three times as large as ours -- as a proportion
of gross national product -- without having inflationary results nearly
as serious. <BR>
<BR>
PB: How did the ideas of supply--side economics develop?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: The essential ideas of supply-side economics arose in response to
the tri-umph of Keynesian economics, which is essentially based on the proposition
that purchasing power drives the economy. In the Keynesian view, it's dollars
in people's pockets -- aggregate demand -- that make the economy go. It
doesn't really matter very much how the dollars get into people's pockets.
<BR>
As a matter of fact, over the years, the Keynesian theory has reached the
conclusion that the best way to put dollars into people's pockets is through
government spending. As individuals in the economy, we're pretty good aggregate-demanders,
but sometimes we like to save money rather than spend it. In Keynesian terms,
savings is a &quot;leakage&quot; from the flow of aggregate demand that
makes the economy run.<BR>
<BR>
PB: That's the demand side of the equation.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes. The demand-siders are really interested in monetary aggregates
-- that's their central concern. Aggregate demand consists of money in consumers'
pockets, money available for investment in the pockets of businessmen and
money in the government's pocket.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Are there other areas in which you think our national priorities are
wrong?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes. We do not adequately re-ward human creativity and initiative,
which is really the most valuable force in the economy. The Democrats increasingly,
by focusing on investment tax credits and benefits for buildings and machines,
have ignored the most valuable capital in the system -- human capital. Even
when they acknowledge the value of human capital, they see it as manufac-tured
in schools, rather than as a product of individual incentives, creativity
and effort.<BR>
<BR>
PB: At what tax rate do you think diminishing returns set in?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I believe that any tax rate over 35% costs more than it's worth.
In other words, it damages total economic activity by a greater extent than
it in-creases government revenues.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Can that be proved, or is it just your feeling?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: It s a feeling, but it's an observa-tion that I think most people
will affirm. I think your own observations will con-firm that when the government
has taken more than 35% of addition-al revenues, your activity changes.
To an increasing degree, people begin to consider ways of avoiding taxation,
and they place less stress on earning more money. I would be willing to
defend that proposition. Asian countries that have lower marginal rates
of taxation have been growing much more rapidly than any other countries
in the world. Japan, in particular, has rates of margin-al taxation less
than half as high as ours, on comparable incomes.<BR>
<BR>
PB: But aren't Japan's tax rates supposed to be just as high and just as
steep as ours?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: They are, but the top rate, which is about 70%, like ours, applies
only to incomes over $396,000 in Japan. The top German rate of 56% applies
only to incomes over $50,000. In the United States, any ''unearned in-come&quot;
earned by those whose salary is over $50,000 is taxed at the 70% rate. We
have vastly more punishing marginal rates of taxation than any of the Asian
countries that have been grow-ing faster than any other countries in the
world since the Second World War.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Some observers attribute those rates of growth to cultural or societal
differences.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That's ridiculous. The Chinese in Hong Kong and Singapore and Taiwan
have very low rates of taxation. The highest rate in Hong Kong is 15%. People
there work terribly hard and ter-ribly productively. As I say, they have
the fastest growing economies in the world. Put those same Chinese in a
Communist system and you have an extraordinarily stagnant and ineffective
economic ar-rangement, even though the people prob-ably work just as hard
in mainland China -- maybe harder.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What about the analyses -- done at Harvard and MIT among other places
-- that show that people won't work hard enough to produce the increased
revenues that supply-siders predict?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: They miss the point entirely. Supply-siders don't predict that people
will work 30% harder as a result of a 30% reduction in tax rates. They merely
predict that people will work 30% more efficiently. They'll tend to focus
their efforts more on taxable activity and less on untaxed activity. These
changes are not directly measurable at all by the kinds of analysis that
all those learned economists have been sponsoring.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Do most other Western nations have payroll withholding taxes as we do?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes. Most nations deduct social-security taxes at the paycheck level.
We have a greater stress on income taxation. A higher proportion of our
revenue comes from income-taxation than in other countries, except England,
Sweden and Denmark. The other countries large-ly focus on value-added taxes,
which are a kind of national sales taxes. They're collected on the &quot;value
added&quot; at each stage of manufacturing and marketing.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Isn't the VAT widely alleged to be a very regressive tax, meaning that
it falls more heavily on the poor than on the rich?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: It's alleged to be a regressive tax, but it can be adjusted, as
it is in most countries, so that it's greater on luxury goods than it is
on necessities. Most real necessities, such as food, are excluded from value-added
taxation.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Would you support it as an alternative to an income tax?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I think it's preferable to an in-come tax, but I wouldn't support
it unless it were accompanied by a much more drastic reduction in the income
tax. In other words, I don't support it as a supplement to existing forms
of taxa-tion, and so far this is the only way it has been advocated. <BR>
Recall that the in-come tax was initially enacted as a tem-porary expedient
because it was such an efficient and affirmative way to raise funds. Somebody
suggested a 10% ceiling on the income tax, and the argu-ment was made that
if you impose a 10% ceiling, the tax would tend to rise all the way up to
10%. So it was decided not to have such a high ceiling, lest we achieve
this confiscatory rate of taxation. <BR>
<BR>
I would want to be sure that the value-added tax weren't just piled on top
of all the other kinds of taxation in the United States.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Is there any condition under which people will willingly pay taxes?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Sure. People are willing to pay taxes when they get something in
return. You'll pay taxes to support the police, roads, libraries, hospitals
-- all legitimate services that governments offer in various constituencies.
It's only when people begin believing that the government is taking more
than it provides that tax revolts occur. <BR>
<BR>
Jude Wanniski, one of the founders of the new school of supply-side economics
-- as opposed to the classical school, which was started by Jean Baptiste
Say and Adam Smith -- points out that in Stalingrad, during World War Two,
people were happily taxed at more than 100% in order to hold off the enemy.
They allowed themselves nearly to starve, in order to provide food to continue
the defense effort. If people really believe that government services are
worth what they cost, they'll forgo income to support them. <BR>
<BR>
But, under cur-rent circumstances, most people think the government charges
more than it delivers, so they reasonably reduce their activity and try
to avoid taxation.<BR>
<BR>
PB: If you were President and you had an amenable Congress, what sort of
tax program would you put through?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I'd like income taxation at a flat rate of 20% or so, depending
on the revenue needs.<BR>
PB: No progressive rates?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Not for me. I don't think pro-gressivity does any good. It hurts
the poor.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Please explain.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Progressive tax rates don't redis-tribute income; they redistribute
tax-payers. They move wealthy people out of the productive economy into
offshore tax havens and unproductive tax shel-ters. Progressive tax rates
have had this effect most dramatically where they are steepest, in Sweden
and England, where anybody who makes any money immedi-ately leaves.<BR>
 <BR>
Bjorn Borg lives in Monte Carlo. The Beatles spread to the four corners
of the earth. All sorts of wealthy British have emigrated to the U. S. to
avoid the preposterous British tax rates. For many years, they had a 98%
rate on unearned income. The cream of the British economy was redistributed
by ill-conceived taxes to Beverly Hills and Bermuda and Malta and Spain
-- any-where but in productive work to contrib-ute to the wealth and welfare
of the poorer British citizen who stayed home.<BR>
<BR>
PB: So you advocate an across-the-board flat tax rate on incomes.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That is the ideal system. To get there, my general focus is on cutting
personal-income-tax rates, abolishing the distinction between earned and
un-earned income, and then cutting the remaining tax rates regularly.<BR>
<BR>
PB: That is more or less what Ron-ald Reagan has advocated. Do you see Reagan
as an effective President?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes. He's just been quite re-markable. Take, for example, his ap-proach
to the Office of Management and Budget. The usual idea is to appoint a banker
friend or somebody who has a lot of experience in accounting. It's always
been regarded as a neutral office, to which are appointed people who are
adept at managing numbers -- as if gov-ernment really consists of the mobiliza-tion
of competing armies of statistics. <BR>
<BR>
And Reagan didn't. In designating Da-vid Stockman, he appointed not only
a brilliant policy analyst but one who had supported John Connally during
the campaign, who was regarded as alto-gether too bumptious and aggressive
by many of his congressional associates and who was opposed by many other
people on Reagan's staff at the time. <BR>
<BR>
Also, Stockman was a leader in a very controversial movement in economics,
and Reagan gave him the central role in his Administration. That's a bold
act by a President.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What is your vision of the future of our economy?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I am very bullish, very optimistic about the future of the American
econ-omy. I think that the gloom that has beset us in recent years originates
from three chief assumptions: That we are running out of energy, that we
have some basic productivity problems that can't be resolved and that capitalism
was somehow maladjusted to the modern age, so that the various totalitarian
systems would necessarily prevail.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Do you dissent from those assumptions?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes. In all three cases, I see major new developments of the highest
prom-ise. I see huge new finds of natural gas, which, even though they haven't
all been proved to date, nonetheless, collec-tively suggest that today we
have a wider variety of energy sources available or in view than ever before
in human history. <BR>
<BR>
I see that the productivity problem is rapidly being resolved by the applica-tion
of new technology in the service industries. All these word-processors,
computer terminals and telecommunica-tions devices are being installed and
adopted by ever more offices, but they have yet to be mastered and fully
integrated into efficient systems. As we move into the '80s, I think the
result will be major and dramatic advances in productivity. <BR>
<BR>
The third point is the astonishing triumph of capitalism in the past decade.
When I went to Harvard, and later worked on the Council on Foreign Re-lations,
the general consensus was that the Maoist experiment in China was exerting
this potent magnetism on the overseas Chinese on the edge of the mainland.
Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong and even Japan would slowly be induced to adopt
Communist approaches and techniques. <BR>
<BR>
Well, today, all the magnetism has flowed in the other direction. Who would
believe that lit-tle outposts like Hong Kong and Singapore and Taiwan would
be shap-ing the future of mainland China? That the leaders on the mainland
are consult-ing the overseas Chinese on how to adopt capitalist techniques
and regen-erate the economy? This is an incredible change, a development
that has the greatest portent for the future.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Given the supply-siders' con-cern for individual freedom, do they take
issue with government regulation?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Most supply-siders emerged from a system in which Government had
a huge role already. Contemporary supply--side economics is a post-welfare-state
phenomenon. We accept the existence of government and the need for regula-tion
in many areas. We don't oppose regulation except where costs are much greater
than benefits.<BR>
 <BR>
I like the example of rules for a basketball game. You need a certain number
of rules in order to have a basketball game at all. Without rules about
dribbling and shooting, without boundaries, you wouldn't have a basketball
game that was fun to play or entertaining to watch. However, if you begin
to prescribe rules about the exact inflection at which players are allowed
to release their shots, or how high they can jump from different loca-tions
on the floor, or just how fast they can run under prescribed circumstances,
at a certain point the rules tend to become counterproductive. <BR>
<BR>
I think our current problem is that we've gone be-yond the point where rules
promote order and productivity to a point where they are a new form of disorder.
We earlier discovered that soap was a form of pollution; now we're finding
that rules are a new form of unruliness.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You're not talking about a re-turn to the 19th century, then?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Not at all. We believe de-regulation is eminently desirable, not
because we oppose a clean environment or a safe workplace or support the
desirability of poisoning people with un-tested new pharmaceuticals, but
because we believe the current laws are far more complex than understood,
and that the bureaucracies they've spawned are too large and too poorly
organized to achieve any beneficial effect.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Would you give us an example?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: An obvious example is the enor-mous effort to eliminate auto-pollutants,
requiring catalytic converters and other expensive devices. No one has yet
shown a relationship between auto-pollutants and any disease. It has yet
to be demon-strated that the catalytic converters eliminate pollutants any
more damaging than the ones they emit. [EPA disputes this, claiming that
a relationship be-tween certain types of respiratory and cardiovascular
diseases and auto-pollut-ants has, in fact, been demonstrated. Sim-ilarly,
the EPA claims that emittants from catalytic converters are not harmful.]
<BR>
<BR>
Enormous new expense was imposed on our auto industry without any evidence
of beneficial results. One of the obvious effects was the willingness of
people to buy vans and pickups and retain old automobiles much longer than
they did in the past. People are using more in-efficient, more pollutant
vehicles to an increasing degree.<BR>
<BR>
PB: So you would not restrict tech-nological progress at the expense of
environmental concerns?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That's rarely the choice. Throughout history, tech-nological progress
has entailed the replacement of heavy and potentially damaging machinery
with more efficient and less environmentally destructive means of production.
The obvious development is from the steam engine to the silicon chip. Current
microprocessors the size of a fly have more computing power than the early
computers that would fill up a gym-nasium with tubes and wires. <BR>
<BR>
In gen-eral, economic progress has tended to result in smaller, lighter,
more efficient, less pollutant equipment. To hold back economic progress
in the name of re-ducing environmental damage is entire-ly counterproductive.
This does not mean that intelligent regulation should not be promulgated
in order to transmit to businesses knowledge that's not trans-mitted by
the marketplace.<BR>
<BR>
PB: For example, the marketplace wouldn't resolve the problem of Amer-ican
industrial pollution that descends on Canada as acid rain, would it?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: No. The marketplace doesn't ordinarily place a value on air, or
on water, or on land beyond its borders. In cases such as acid rain, there
may be times when simple Government regula-tions are preferable to some
purer form of market action.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Why do so many well-inten-tioned government programs wind up achieving
precisely the opposite of their planned results?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: This is the phenomenon that I call moral hazards of liberalism.
Moral hazards is an insurance term. It refers to the potentially negative
results of an insurance policy. The moral hazard of fire insurance is arson.
When the insur-ance on a building exceeds its value, spontaneous combustion
often results. There's nothing the insurance company can do about it except
to reduce the payoff.<BR>
<BR>
PB: How does that relate to public policy?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: The moral hazard of unemploy-ment insurance is unemployment. When
government-paid unemployment bene-fits -- plus leisure time -- become greater
than the benefits of work, unemploy-ment increases. The moral hazard of
welfare tends to be broken families and increased poverty -- because, when
welfare benefits become greater than the bene-fits of maintaining an intact
family with an employed breadwinner, then more and more families will tend
to break up and the breadwinner will go to the streets -- into crime and
the underground economy. <BR>
<BR>
And, when the man is gone, the chances of that family's escaping poverty
plummet. Even though its income in-creases, the only way to escape poverty
ultimately is to work. If the government provides the income and the father
leaves the family, the family is still im-poverished, even if its income
exceeds the official government poverty level. With no real hope for the
future, with great difficulty disciplining its children, particularly its
boys, the family will live a slovenly and disorganized existence that will
shock any social worker who ex-amines it. <BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless, the welfare benefits this family receives, combined with the
food stamps, the housing sub-sidies and all the other programs that have
been enacted for the poor, are far greater than the total incomes of middle-class
people 20 years ago.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You're saying that the real income of welfare families today is higher
than the middle-class wage was in 1960. Is that accounting for inflation?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That includes inflation. Welfare benefits today are worth on the
average between $15,000 and $20,000 a year. That would be equivalent to
an income of about $7,000 a year in 1960, which was the median income then.
We mustn't forget that welfare is, in a sense, an insurance scheme. It's
insurance for people who, presumably, through no fault of their own or through
some con-catenation of events, fail to earn enough money to support themselves.
The con-cept is of insurance. <BR>
But when the bene-fits rise beyond the insurance level, they foster the
very disasters that are being insured against. In other words, they create
incentives for unemployment and family breakdown. And that's wily the Reagan
concept of welfare reform, at least as it applied in California, is misconceived.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Why?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: In California, they seem to think you can raise the benefits to
any level. Reagan raised them by 43% for the alleged &quot;truly needy,&quot;
while, at the same time, he increased the welfare po-lice to investigate
fraud and abuse. Once again, this is a case of ignoring the supply-side
rule, which is that people change their behavior to re-spond to incentives.
<BR>
<BR>
You can't increase welfare benefits 43% without rad-ically changing the
pattern of incentives confronting poor people. You can kick a lot of people
off the rolls for a few years, as Reagan did in California, but soon enough
they readjust their lives to do what the government prescribes. If government
projects a concept of true neediness, the poor will quickly convert themselves
to the &quot;truly needy.&quot; You want disability? All right, I'll give
you disability. You want a mother with three kids who doesn't know who the
father is? Fine, I forget Daddy's name. Right now it just totally escaped
my mind. I don't know who the hell he is.<BR>
<BR>
The point is, welfare applicants don't even have to adjust their lives,
they just have to adjust their behavior in the welfare office. My book Visible
Man documents that proposition fully. I went to the welfare office many
times with various of the characters in the book. They would all ask the
clerks, &quot;How do you want these forms filled out?&quot; The forms are
something totally alien to them. They can't find any correspond-ence between
their lives and those forms, so they simply find out what they're supposed
to say. &quot;What do you want me to say? What am I supposed to say?&quot;
And then they say it.<BR>
<BR>
PB: It seems reasonably certain that Reagan as President has no intention
of increasing welfare benefits nationally. Do you think it's a reasonable
prospect to consider reducing them?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Not really. The Reagan program is not significantly reducing welfare
benefits. There are some changes in eligibility, but in essence they are
leav-ing these programs intact. I think the Reagan Administration will be
resistant to further expansion in these programs, while at the same time
heavily devoted to expanding opportunities in the real economy. The result
will be that as time passes, the attractions of work in the productive economy
will rise, while the attractions of the welfare culture will decline. Welfare
benefits will di-minish, not in absolute terms or in real purchasing power
but in relation to the steadily increasing wages in a growing economy.<BR>
<BR>
PLAYBOY: On what basis do you make that projection?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: In California, after Proposition 13, which essentially reduced marginal
taxation at the state level, everybody predicted unemployment and stagna-tion.
Of all the leading economists, only Arthur Laffer accurately predicted the
outcome. He predicted that the California economy would greatly expand and
that people would voluntarily leave government service to take advantage
of improving opportunities in the private sector. And that's just what happened.
There was no great need to fire govern-ment workers, because they left voluntarily.
<BR>
<BR>
Just about every prediction made by aggregate analysis on the basis of the
California tax cut was wrong. Invari-ably, the supply-side analysis was
vindi-cated. On balance, the impact on the incentives of individuals easily
overrode the impact on the aggregate movements of funds.<BR>
<BR>
PB: But California is a special case.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Yes. It's a special case. It s just one example. Another example
is Puerto Rico, where Governor Carlos Romero Barcelo finally decided to
dismantle an egregiously ineffective tax system that a deputation of eminent
economists from Yale had recommended as the only way to increase its equality
of income dis-tribution. As a result, Puerto Rico had preposterously high
income-tax rates, about 20% higher than our rates in the United States.
Barcelo, after con-sulting with Laffer and Wanniski, started cutting these
taxes and removing the surcharges. Every year, after each tax cut, income
expanded across the whole island by a far greater margin than the tax cut,
and revenues to the government increased. <BR>
<BR>
It's the same story: Increase individual incentive, and you promote economic
growth.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Let's talk about economic in-centives for young people. Would you advocate
loosening minimum-wage re-strictions to promote teenage employment?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: The minimum-wage law is one of thousands of laws that don't do any
good. But it's so frequently ignored that it's not as significant as many
people imagine. The problem in the ghetto is not the minimum wage. The problem
is welfare benefits that are collectively worth more than twice the minimum
wage.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Nonetheless, conventional con-servative wisdom holds that teenage unemployment
is largely caused by minimum-wage barriers.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well, I don't believe that. I think that teenage unemployment is
ex-acerbated by the minimum wage -- and I don't support the minimum wage.
But I do not accept the idea that our current problems of teenage unemploy-ment
in the inner cities are caused by the minimum-wage requirements. They're
caused by the breakdown of the black family and the demoralization of teenage
boys who have never seen what it means to work to earn a living.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Are you saying the minimum wage is ineffective?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: In the ghetto, it certainly is. No-body goes into ghetto communities
to enforce the minimum wage. Nobody pays taxes in those areas. Half the
retail transactions in ghetto establishments are off the books. I dissent
from the whole idea that we have a rigorously enforced small-business economy
in the ghetto in which rules like the minimum wage have any substantial
effect. <BR>
Don't mis-understand me. It's a negative factor -- one more obstacle to
youth employment. <BR>
<BR>
PB: You seem to speak with some authority.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well, I spent two years researching Visible Man, which concerns
young people in the ghetto.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Did you live in the ghetto?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: On the edge of it, in Albany. Also, I did hundreds of interviews
with black teenagers in New York City through my association on the board
of the Vocational Foundation.<BR>
<BR>
PB: And on the basis of all that, do you feel that you're better able to
make observations about how a ghetto economy works?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well, honestly, more than the vast majority of sociological experts
on black poverty, I really did spend three years examining very little else.
I inter-viewed literally hundreds of people at great length in all sorts
of contexts in Albany. Then I spent some weeks in Greenville, South Carolina,
interview-ing the same people and their families down there. And I also
did a lot in New York City. So I really did have a good perspective on the
whole problem.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What did you learn?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I confirmed all my preconcep-tions. I had read all the previous
anthropological literature on the subject, so that my prejudices weren't
entirely groundless. And, on the basis of thisprevious literature, I developed
the themes of Sexual Suicide, which really originated with my ghetto analysis.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You're talking about the work for which the National Organization for
Women awarded you its Pig of the Year award. How did it begin?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Before I answer, I have to tell you that I succeeded Norman Mailer
in receiving that award and, since it hasn't been awarded since, I think
I've retired the trophy.<BR>
<BR>
PB: We're impressed.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: It began with my support of President Nixon's veto of the Javits-/Mondale
child-development bill, which would have created a vast system of federal
day-care centers all across the country. I was editor of The Ripon Forum,
the magazine of the Ripon Soci-ety, a liberal Republican group. I wrote
an editorial opposing these day-care centers, and a bunch of leading Ripon
ladies went on the Today Show to pro-test my vicious polemics and to try
to get me fired. <BR>
<BR>
Then I went on the TV program The Advocates. This particular program was
a debate on day care, and I was brought in to speak for the oppo-sition.
The other people on the show were all Congressmen and professors and experts
on the subject. After I was through, a mass of women in the audi-ence rushed
forward to attack me. Since for decades I'd been seeking a way to arouse
the passionate interests of wom-en, I realized that I'd found my tech-nique,
and it worked for years afterward. And it was then, as I stood there reveling
in my good fortune, that I conceived the idea of writing Sexual Suicide.<BR>
<BR>
PB: We were wondering when you'd explain how you came to write about both
money and sex.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: When I was single, I was pre-occupied with sex. Now that I'm an
elder statesman, I've moved on to a more dignified concern: Preoccupation
with money.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Staying with the former pre-occupation, wasn't it your statement that
you didn't believe in equal pay for equal work that first truly enraged
feminists?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That's not what I said. I do believe in equal pay for equal work.
But I don't believe any government program is more likely to encourage this
than the workings of the marketplace. I've seen no evidence that quotas
or gov-ernment programs have fostered it in the slightest degree. The usual
victims of quotas or affirmative-action programs are men with few credentials,
little ed-ucation and large families to support. Upper-class feminists all
believe that any man who makes it just by working harder than a college-educated
feminist must be an evil oppressor.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Hold it. In the first place, you're generalizing about feminists by
depicting them as upper-class elitists. <BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Most feminists are upper-class women. They may call themselves mid-dle
class, but, in fact, a great many of them are in the top 10% of earners.
or they're graduate students or other exalted figures in our system. And
a woman who is a Radcliffe graduate, a relative dilettante in the work force,
often resents the fact that lower-class men can earn more money than she
does by working hard -- often at two jobs -- by putting in overtime and
organizing their lives well.<BR>
<BR>
When you look at the evidence that's available on earnings of the two sexes,
you find that the only group that earns far more than its education and
creden-tials would justify is married men with large families and a high-school
educa-tion or less. My point is that if you know any of these men, you know
they earn every dollar. They deserve more money for the work they do. At
least they deserve it more than some graduate student who wants a &quot;fulfilling&quot;
job in a foundation-sponsored cultural-uplift program. <BR>
<BR>
To the extent the gov-ernment enacts equal pay for equal work, it will mean
more stress on such factors as race and sex, and even more on credentials
and qualifications, while relying less on work effort and ingenuity and
drive and ambition -- those very fac-tors that every close analysis shows
are most important in increasing economic productivity. What many feminists
think will be a fairer system will actually be most unfair: It will favor
the upper classes, who can buy credentials, over the lower classes, who
must compete by working harder and more aggressively.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You re certainly overlooking the Norma Raes of this country, the millions
of working-class women who would agree with some of the aims of the feminist
movement.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well, the leaders are all upper--class, and I think many of their
argu-ments apply only to that class -- in other words, that women should
be freer to enter the work force to broaden their horizons and do something
more &quot;ful-filling.&quot; For those women who have to work out of economic
necessity, the op-portunities are there.<BR>
<BR>
PB: So, to you, the political aims of the women's movement are merely an
expression of upper-class lobbying.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: That's the real clash -- between lower-class, hard-working men without
a lot of elegant refinements and upper-class women who want their credentials
instantly converted into high salaries. And when I talk about &quot;high
salaries,&quot; I mean the upper 10%. Remem-ber that, in this country, anyone
who earns more than $35,000 is in the top 10%, and when you inquire of these
oppressed feminists, you often find they are earning salaries at that level
-- or believe they should be -- when, in fact, such salaries are the object
of the most intense competition. Very few men -- only the most aggressive,
excep-tional and lucky men -- can achieve that kind of income.<BR>
<BR>
I just think the whole women's move-ment is economically illiterate. It
wants to increase government power in a most arbitrary, destructive way,
in the most sensitive area of the nation's econ-omy -- personnel policy.
That's the area where the most subjective and human of factors are involved,
hundreds of them, and they cannot possibly be re-duced to the sorts of statistical
findings a federal judge or a panel of equal-rights advocates would deem
relevant. To have these decisions made by judges and panelists is ridiculous.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Still, wouldn't you acknowl-edge the fact that many of the inequities
the feminist movement battled against were real?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Actually, it was the feminist movement that was never real. It was
all based on fantasy. Women will never pursue careers with the same determina-tion
and drive that men do. Some will, and those some will rise to very high
levels, as indeed they do now. <BR>
<BR>
But, as to the notion that the women's movement has liberated women from
their &quot;traditional&quot; roles, there's just no evidence that women
are working any harder. Women are 11 times as likely to leave the work force
as men are. [According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. by 1980, women
were only five times as likely to leave the work force.] A couple of years
ago, there was great outrage that female doctors were earning less than
male doctors -- until it was determined that female doctors saw 40% few-er
patients than male doctors.<BR>
<BR>
Wherever you look, if you examine the facts, you discover that women do
not engage themselves in the work force with the same ambition and drive
that men exhibit. Until they do, they won't earn equal money. And they never
will, because they have more options than men -- namely, they can withdraw
from the workforce when they wish to, in order to raise children, a fully
respect-able role.<BR>
The idea that large numbers of women are going to make earning money their
top priority misunderstands the difference between the sexes. Men have to
earn money to be sexual beings -- providers, husbands, fathers. Women have
a full range of choices. You can say that, actually, the woman is superior
because her sexuality ranges through pregnancy, the nurture of children
and all sorts of events of vast importance to society. Men have to do only
one thing.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Wasn't the whole idea behind women's liberation a freeing of both sexes
-- for women to be able to compete equally in the marketplace and for men
to share in the nurturing of children?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Obviously, the men can't share fully in the nurturing process, and
if you go back to Margaret Mead's quote about motherhood's being a biological
fact and fatherhood a cultural inven-tion, comparing the two is crazy. It's
just plain quixotic to have a society depend on the cultural invention of
a father's &quot;sharing&quot; in the same way it depends or the biological
fact of bear-ing a child in one's body and nurturing it at one's breast.<BR>
Regardless of how desirable it may be for men to participate deeply in the
experience of child-raising, these are not characteristic male roles. Masculinity
is not defined through relations with chil-dren: By bottle-feeding a baby,
you don't affirm your sense of yourself as a man. That's why it's the men
who are already secure in their masculinity who are best able to adapt to
the feminist program. Men who aren't fulfilling themselves as providers
have to fund their masculinity in some other ways. <BR>
<BR>
Among the most conspicuous ways, in these years of liberation, are violence
and drinking and other vicarious macho experiences. In other words, what
the feminists attack as male callousness is a product of masculine insecurity
rather than confidence. Feminists increase this insecurity, and thus increase
the pro-pensity of men to assert their masculin-ity in violent and destructive
ways -- and to disparage women as well. <BR>
<BR>
I mean, if you're confident of your own masculin-ity, you can acknowledge
that woman in m any ways are superior to men and are indispensable to male
happiness and fulfillment.<BR>
<BR>
PB: But if what you say is true, aren't you having it both ways? You say
that men who aren't successful at being men are the ones who resist the
women's movement, who disparage women and that men who are successful at
be-ing good providers, at being men, are the ones who can best adapt to
it. If the aims of the women's movement were based on &quot;fantasy,&quot;
why would the most successful men support it?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER Not all do. But those who do are doing so out of chivalry. It's fascinating
to me that so many men who come from traditional backgrounds, who went to
all-male prep schools, through an all-male military, who probably never
worked for a women or gave much thought to female liberation, suddenly find
themselves mouthing feminist clich&eacute;s -- mainly because their wives
were captivated by an essay by Gloria Steinhem. It's just chivalry; they
don't take it seriously. <BR>
<BR>
Ronald Reagan opposes the ERA, but he felt he should give equal time to
his daughter Maureen on the issue. So she uses radio time that he, Ronald
Reagan, earned to attack his position. He wouldn't have done this on any
other issue. It shows he isn't serious about it. It's typical male-chauvinist
behavior: In-dulge the little lady and allow her to be a feminist.<BR>
<BR>
PB: That's interesting. You've ef-fectively called your friend Ronald Reagan
a male chauvinist.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well -- yes. These are the real male chauvinists. The man who is
a suc-cessful lawyer, or the president of a corporation, or the President
of the United States is secure in his manhood, so he allows the little woman
her frivolous ideologies. He may even say he's a feminist himself, because
he doesn't take these concerns very seriously. This shows disdain for women,
not respect. <BR>
Male in-dulgence of feminism is the new male chauvinism. It says, &quot;I
can't be worried by anything these women do; let them do it. I can't be
threatened.&quot; Well, a man who's serious understands he can be threatened
by women. That, in fact, he is more dependent on women than women are on
him. And that a movement like the women's movement can threaten him -- and
society. <BR>
Because what does feminism liberate? It chiefly liber-ates men. It liberates
men from the responsibilities of monogamous marriage, which is the foundation
of civilized life.<BR>
<BR>
PB: How do you square monogamy with your earlier explanation of the double
standard of sexuality?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: I said that male sexuality is com-pulsive and short-lived, in contrast
to the women's sexuality, but I feel it needs to be domesticated, in a sense,
by women. Otherwise, as statistics show, it impels a very difficult life
for the single male. <BR>
<BR>
Marriage leads to the subordina-tion of compulsive -- and promiscuous --
male sexual experience to the long-term maternal horizons of female sexuality.
It links men to the future through chil-dren. So when the feminists insist
that female sexuality is the same as that of men, it's just erroneous, as
any man could testify, and fundamentally hostile to women.<BR>
<BR>
The idea that women have the same kind of compulsive, single-minded sexual
potential that men have simply isn't borne out by any of the evidence. They're
superior sexually, because they<BR>
have more options and a broader range of sexuality, but it's not the same.
They can have as much copulatory sexual ex-perience as men, but they can
also forgo it more easily.<BR>
<BR>
PB: So you wouldn't admit that the pill and other contraception have had
any effect in changing women's sexual behavior? Plenty of studies indicate
they have.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Oh, sure, the pill has had an ef-fect, but the argument that forgoing
motherhood in favor of a promiscuous sex life has enriched women is a very
dubious proposition. <BR>
<BR>
In any case, the pill would have increased only the very narrow activity
of copulation, and the notion that all of sex can be defined as copulation
is a male-chauvinist idea. To the extent that women accommodate themselves
to that idea, they deny them-selves a far greater sexual potential. You
find a lot of women who have accepted this now expressing their unhappiness,
which the feminists then take as further proof of their oppression. Female
sex-uality is much more extensive and ful-filling than the male version,
because it's linked to other things more important -- continuity and nurturing.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Much of your argument is based on women's childbearing role. But what
about women who (A) choose not to have children or (B) want to enter the
work force before or after rais-ing children?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: The vast majority of women still do bear children. Of the women
who enter the work force, some will succeed extraordinarily. But, in general,
women won't enter the work force in the same spirit as men. Motherhood is
still the central role for women in all societies, and it certainly is central
to those young, dynamic years when families are formed and careers are launched.
<BR>
<BR>
Women have a more important role altogether in the human race, but there
is one area where men will tend to excel -- and that's in the workplace.
Men will tend to com-pete harder at earning money, because that's what determines
their relationship to family and their access to children. Because they
always have other options, women won't work as hard as men -- they generally
don't take outdoor work, for example, where the money can be better. And,
far from accepting the fact that there's been this vast change, I think
that women don't work as hard today as they did in the past. I grew up in
a farming community, and when America was dominated by farming, women bore
children and worked long-er hours at their chores and in the fields -- contributing
greatly to the econ-omy -- than many do today at careers.<BR>
<BR>
The reason that women don't general-ly win the &quot;rat race&quot; is that
they have more enriching experiences to choose from centered on the family.
Men have to perform outside the family to re-ceive the benefits from it
-- even to per-form sexually. The sex act itself depends on male confidence,
and that's why all societies ascribe special importance to male achievements,
even if, objectively, they're not as important as women's achievements.<BR>
<BR>
PB: But you still haven't addressed our question. If the pill has liberated
women from the automatic fear of preg-nancy, and if women want to compete
in the work force outside of that relatively short childbearing period,
why shouldn't the opportunities and poten-tial be the same as for men?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well, first, I think the pill mainly liberated men, allowing them
to find more opportunities for their short-term, compulsive sexuality. I
don't see that it enriched women's lives. <BR>
But, as to the work opportunities, they're there -- for men and women alike.
Women aren't held back. My argument is that to the extent we encourage,
by legislation or otherwise, forced equality in the work-place, we undermine
the strength of so-ciety. <BR>
<BR>
Incidentally, on the question of postponing motherhood, I've been in-volved
with some groups of older Ameri-cans, and overwhelmingly, the response of
those who waited until their 30s to have kids was that they missed having
grandchildren. Those who had children earlier said that one of the single
most enriching experiences of their lives was the enjoyment of their grandchildren.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You surely have more compli-cated thoughts about contraception. Where
do you stand on abortion?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: It's a bad form of birth control. When it's made freely available,
it tends to become the dominant form of birth control, as it has in many
East European countries and in Sweden. Half of all Swedish pregnancies end
in abortion, and one third of all births are illegitimate. [According to
U.N. statistics, fewer than one quarter of Swedish pregnancies end in abortion.]
Abortion also can in-crease problems of sterility. <BR>
<BR>
But I know there are all sorts of tragic problems associated with the issue,
and I frankly have no easy solution or response. I certainly don't oppose
other forms of birth control.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Do you find many intelligent women agreeing with your views?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Antifeminist women tend to be more intelligent and interesting than
feminist women, because they aren't con-formists. Feminists in general succumb
to the fashion that prevails among the American intelligentsia, while it
takes real intellectual courage and conviction to resist this juggernaut,
which most of the media have fueled and supported. <BR>
<BR>
Women like Phyllis Schlafly and her supporters understand the crucial role
of women in society and the impor-tance of maintaining sex roles in order
to have a happy and stable society. They know that it's the differences
between the sexes that lead to love and fulfill-ment and that attempts to
overcome those differences lead to impotence, ste-rility and a tedious kind
of sensuality.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Let's pursue this topic of sex-ual differences a bit more. You've re-peatedly
singled out aggressiveness in males as one of the factors that make them
better competitors in the work force. And in Sexual Suicide, you wrote,
&quot;Boys are more aggressive because of how they are born, not how they
are raised.&quot; Where's your proof of that?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Biology isn't the only factor, but it's certainly true that men
are more aggressive in every society known to anthropology. As a matter
of fact, two leading feminist scholars, Carol Jacklin and Eleanor Maccoby
of Stanford, wrote a voluminous study called Psychology Of Sex Differences.
In it, they concluded<BR>
that the greater aggressiveness of men is biologically determined -- in
all societies and in animal studies. The studies were made in infancy, before
socialization could be a factor. <BR>
I also maintained in Sexual Suicide that, beyond being a biological fact,
it was also a psychological reality, because the sex act itself requires
greater aggres-siveness by the man. Finally, it's an evolutionary experience
-- because if most of our history has been in hunting societies -- males
have depended for their very survival on aggressive kinds of hunting activities,
while women have always been responsible for nurturing small children, which
is a less aggressive responsibility.<BR>
<BR>
PB: Haven't there been societies in which the women have done not only the
raising of children but most of thehunting and food gathering as well?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Sure, there have been societies where men strutted around and pre-tended
that killing a giraffe every six months was the key to the survival of the
tribe, while the women did all the work. But those were irrational soci-eties
that didn't do very well. You can channel natural male aggressiveness into
roles that are unproductive for the community, and even exalt those roles,
but ordinarily the community won't survive.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What about the evidence of matriarchal societies?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: There is no such evidence. Steven Goldberg wrote a book, The Inevitabili-ty
Of Patriarchy, which Margaret Mead described as &quot;flawless in its presentation
of the data&quot; and which refuted every claim ever made that there had
been a matriarchic society. [Margaret Mead actually wrote, &quot;The reporting
of his sources cannot be faulted... It is when he puts his pieces together...to
form his 'theory,' that he ceases to be persua-sive.&quot;] In each case
that a feminist had described a matriarchy, Goldberg would go back to the
original studies cited by the feminist and show that authority in that particular
society was, in fact, vested with the men. <BR>
<BR>
PB: You're saying that there has never been a successful society in which
equality of the sexes has been achieved. What about Israel and China?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Good examples. A lot has been written about both countries and most
of the evidence bears out my position. <BR>
<BR>
In Israel, there was a real attempt at reversing the sexual roles within
the kibbutzim, and it was found that the women themselves took the lead
in re-fusing the powers ascribed to them un-der that system. Over time,
they refused to go out into the fields and cultivate if it meant having
to pack their kids off to the day-care center. Interestingly, never in the
history of the kibbutz experi-ments did men actually take on child-rearing
roles, nor did women ever take positions of authority, as the political
ideology had prescribed. As a result, today the kibbutz has the most strongly
differentiated sex roles in all of Israeli society. [Other studies on the
Israeli kibbutz dispute the fact that no women took positions of authority.]<BR>
<BR>
China was devoted to some kind of anthill egalitarianism, but when a study
was made of 12,000 people listed by the Communist Party as leaders, only
two -- Mrs. Mao and Mrs. Chou -- were women. And both of those, of course,
made it as a result of being married to their husbands. There just isn't
any evidence that the Chinese overcame sexual-role differ-ences except insofar
as they abolished individuality altogether.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You don't think very much of the women's movement, do you?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Well, I don't think it's done us any good, but I wouldn't exaggerate
the impact of it. In general, I am not a sexual liberationist. As I've said,
I think marriage and family are the foundations of civilized life, and anything
that tends to be hostile to the formation of fami-lies -- or receptive to
their breakup -- tends to increase social problems and decrease productivity.<BR>
<BR>
For instance, I think the feminist movement probably hurts young boys. In
the cases I've cited in which the man leaves home, families headed by females
tend to make it more difficult for boys to grow up into responsible and
loving adults. That leads to increasing distress among women about the quality
and attitudes of men they know -- and the circle closes in on itself. Yet
the response of some of these women is to advo-cate yet more women's liberation,
when this process is the cause of the problem rather than the solution to
it.<BR>
<BR>
PB: You'd better explain what you mean when you say that the feminist movement
harms young boys.<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: It goes back to what I said first got me involved in my critique
of femi-nism -- my studies of welfare programs that had the effect of usurping
the father's provider role in the ghetto. The response of feminism to this
miscon-ceived government policy was to pro-pose that welfare mothers be
provided with work and that their children be provided with a massive system
of day--care centers. It struck me that having deprived black families of
fathers, the feminists were proceeding to take away the mothers as well.
<BR>
<BR>
Sometimes I would get the impression, after reading about the proposed solutions,
that to a fem-inist, the only truly liberated individual would be an orphan
at a government-funded day-care center. It just seemed crazy to me.<BR>
<BR>
The real problem, obviously, was to get the fathers back into their homes
as providers. The women just couldn't cope alone with their sons. The boys
were out on the street, finding their masculinity in gangs and various macho
displays, while the mothers were struggling to maintain some kind of order
in the home. <BR>
<BR>
Then the feminists came along with their grand solution: Take the kids away
and stash them in day-care centers and dispatch the mothers to jobs of various
kinds, such as sweeping offices or scrubbing toilets or whatever kinds of
work are available to welfare mothers in America's big cities. And this
was liberation! <BR>
<BR>
The feminists could write won-derful poetry about the stimulating environments
ingenious civil servants could create for the children, but the re-ality
of most day-care programs is a lot less attractive, especially when the
child goes home to a parent exhausted after a nine-hour job. There has been
a lot written by feminists about how good a job can be for both child and
mother, how she goes home invigorated and can be a better parent to the
child. This shows a complete incomprehension of how tiring and difficult
most jobs are.<BR>
<BR>
PB: What about the case of women who, very simply, want to work?<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Of course, there are many women in the market place doing terribly
valua-ble work who are making major con-tributions to society. That's one
of the options those women have. But many women are working chiefly because
they have to, because the economy isn't offer-ing sufficient opportunities
for their husbands, and they're certainly not ex-periencing any kind of
liberation.<BR>
<BR>
PB: We think we sense a closing of your particular circle here, from wom-en's
liberation to men's predicament to your prescription for economic solutions.
<BR>
<BR>
GILDER: Right. Liberation for many wom-en would be the right to return to
the home and devote themselves fully to domestic life. If things go as I
hope, I foresee a booming economy, and one that will be very favorable for
the American family. <BR>
<BR>
In the end, you can't separate economics from sex or faith or love or any
of the other wellsprings of human behavior. The mathematical models of conventional
economic the-ory -- like the unisex models of femi-nism -- leave out everything
that makes life interesting and makes the economy go. Again, you have to
get back to what's in people's heads -- and that's things like love and
ambition, desire and faith, sex and money -- not aggregate demand or undifferentiated
&quot;human beings.&quot; I nev-er met a human being. The people I know
are men and women, and that's the way I like it.<BR>

<BR>
<H3>My friends, it would behoove you to study everything you can get your
hands on by <A HREF="gildrbio.html">George Gilder</A>, a true American genius.
Here is the second interview he was kind enough to grant me for my newsletter.
Learn it, love it, live it. -- Rush Limbaugh<BR>
<BR>
<HR></H3>
	RUSH: You are very gracious, sir, to consent to undergoing another grilling.
What I primarily want to talk to you about is your December 18th op-ed in
The Wall Street Journal. You made the case that American progress and innovation
have depended heavily on genius. But the thing that puts you at odds with
much of populist thought in America today is that you say this genius would
not flourish in this country without immigration. For people who didn't
read the piece, could you basically recap your theory?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: All of America's great achievements have come from immigration.
We initially were a nation of immigrants, of course. That was the initial
genius of America -- that we received people fleeing persecution and oppression
in Europe and elsewhere, who found a land of opportunities, new frontiers,
in the United States.<BR>
	This has been true throughout our history. New waves of immigrants have
resulted in new upsurges of income, productivity, innovation and achievement.
The spearheads of this achievement have always been this &quot;genius class,&quot;
as I roughly describe it. I do believe that genius is 90% perspiration.
But it does have a genetic content as well. This is a class of people who
are just enormously more productive than others, and they tend to go where
they're welcomed, and stay where they're well-treated.<BR>
	America has been their land of opportunity for most of the past century.
Receiving these immigrants during the Second World War made possible the
Manhattan Project, which produced the atomic bomb, which ended the war successfully
and then allowed us to continue in the lead in the arms race. This was critical,
because it was almost entirely immigrants who created the atomic bomb, the
hydrogen bomb, the intercontinental-missile program, the space program.
All were heavily fueled by immigration and the geniuses who emigrated to
our shores.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Is it safe to say that the development of all these projects would
not have occurred at all, were it not for immigration?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Yes. I don't think we could have had the Manhattan Project. The
Manhattan Project was an achievement of European immigrants, a lot of them
Jewish, who brought their genius to the United States and put together the
bomb. There were some Americans, but mostly in relatively lesser roles.
<BR>
	Then, later, all our technologies fed on this input from outsiders -- particularly
the microchip, which is really the heart of the present, American global
leadership. <BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: George, longer than anyone I can recall (aside from those in the
business directly), you have been touting the relevance and importance of
the computer to America's future. In your piece in the Journal you cite
some of the key inventors of the microchip, developers of that technology,
as also being immigrants.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: The company that really founded the microchip industry in the United
States, as the microprocessor industry evolved into the personal-computer
industry, was Fairchild Semiconductor. When the parent company tried to
control it too closely, the key people spun off and became Intel Corporation.
The group at Fairchild and Intel were led by Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce,
both of whom were American geniuses and inventors. But most of the other
people at Intel, or at least half of the other major contributors, were
immigrants. Andrew Grove fled through a field across the Hungarian border
in 1956, barely escaping the Russian tanks. <BR>
	RUSH: Grove runs Intel now.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Yes. Earlier on in his career, he ran a couple of crucial projects
at Intel that made them dominant in MOS technology, Metal Oxide Semiconductor
technology, which is really the foundation of the whole industry. In every
major semiconductor company, and every major semiconductor project, between
a third and two-thirds of key contributors are immigrants. Americans have
just not focused on these hard-core engineering skills.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: But is that a lack of genius indigenous to America?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: I think it's the result of a variety of things. In software, which
entails similar degrees of genius, the numbers are not so high: Probably
10 to 15% of the major contributors to America's software predominance an
immigrants. But they are critical contributors. It's not this overwhelming
phenomenon that one discovers in microchips. But both of them were absolutely
critical to the personal-computer industry, which, in turn, is the driving
force of American economic growth and the spearhead of world economic growth
today.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: A lot of readers -- many of them who might not even have computers
-- are going to argue: &quot;How can you say that? What about all these
jobs we're losing to Japan, jobs we're losing to Mexico, jobs we're losing
across the seas -- the manufacturing jobs that everybody thinks are the
heart and soul of this country?&quot; Here you've just said it is the microchip
and its derivatives which are leading the world today in growth and expansion.<BR>
<BR>
	 GILDER: Since the ascendancy of the microchip, beginning<BR>
around 1970, the U.S. has outperformed all the other economies in the world,
overwhelmingly, in job-creation. You just can't make the argument that we've
been losing jobs to other countries. We've created some 35 million net new
jobs in the last 30 years -- while the Europeans, for example, have created
almost no net new jobs outside of government consumption. The Japanese have
created new employment, but substantially less than we have. <BR>
	How can we be losing jobs to countries that are creating jobs radically
more slowly than we are?<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: But the manufacturing sector is what many people look to and say,
&quot;Hey! You can't be a unionized worker anymore and afford a house. You
used to be able to in America in the '50s. You can't do it anymore.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Anybody whose livelihood depends on examining union jobs and the
performance of unions, or collecting statistics for unions, or mobilizing
campaigns for unions, has a great incentive to disparage all this new employment
and opportunity in America, because it does largely arise outside the unionized
sectors. That is true. The unions have all flocked to the dinosaurs. They
all attempt to preserve jobs in old industries that are declining. <BR>
	And the new employment has been emerging in semiconductors, software, computer
manufacturing, as well as services in software. Manufacturing has continued
to grow. We're the dominant computer manufacturer in the world. We also
lead telecommunications and networks. And the Internet, which is entirely
an American creation, is now the dominant force in the world economy.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Yet you still have, in the American political scene, this anti-immigration
sentiment. And many of the people who are showing some moderate signs of
success [by] attacking this loss of manufacturing sector jobs are conservatives.
Perot's slightly conservative on balance, you'd have to say, although he's
made his money in computers. Buchanan is turning into a David Bonior in
this area, when it comes to industrialized job-loss. <BR>
	And people believe it. When they read you saying this, they're going to
scratch their heads, because there are a tremendous number of citizens who
believe we're losing jobs left and right; that the country is going south
fast; and that we've got to build a wall around America. Yet here you are
saying the worst thing we could possibly do is limit immigration.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Illegal aliens who come in and are prohibited from having employment,
but mandated to receive welfare, are a problem -- it's the welfare state
that's the problem [in that case]. We have a welfare state mandated to reach
out to immigrants and induce them to take advantage of all the benefits.
You've been talking about this on your program. The welfare state is now
an enterprise, and it's &quot;reaching out&quot; to immigrants. The result
is that today's illegal aliens and immigrants are being captured by the
welfare state more rapidly than previous immigrant groups. And this is very
destructive, because welfare destroys everybody it touches.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: There's a rising tide of people who believe that the only way to
fix this is to stop all immigration.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Rush, it makes no sense. I don't think it's very valuable to stop
Mexicans from coming to the United States and doing the jobs they do mostly.
National Review magazine, on the basis of alarms about illegal immigration,
advocates a moratorium on all immigration, which would be incredibly destructive.
It would mean that lots of high-technology companies just couldn't operate
in the United States.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Let's construct a hypothesis here. There's a wall built around America
-- no immigration. We have embarked on a course of acculturating those who
are here, who have not yet learned Americanism. That's the strategy: Until
we can acculturate those who are here, we need to shut down. Are you suggesting
that, if this situation occurred, there is not somehow an ability here toproduce
the genius amongst those who live in the contiguous 48 plus Alaska and Hawaii
to continue this high-tech revolution?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: For certain key jobs and key inventive roles, there are just a
very few people in the world capable of performing them. The numbers are
small, and that small number tends to be distributed all around the world.
So any company that wants to be absolutely on the leading edge, to get the
best people in every field working together to produce some new product
-- whether it's a new kind of fiber-optic application for a broad-band Internet,
or whether it's a new kind of digital disk, or a new Internet computer,
or whatever it is -- those people have to command the best in all these
fields. If they can't get the best people to come to the United States,
they have to go to the best people. That's just a fact of life.<BR>
	And it's not new. It was true about Henry Ford, when he was starting Ford
Motor Company. Ford was the leading-edge company in the world economy, and
he &quot;imported&quot; a whole bunch of people from Scotland, England and
Germany to help him build his cars. Key advances in Ford Motor Company were
attributable to immigrants. When you are leading-edge, you are effectively
the spearhead for the entire planetary economy -- [so] you've got to get
the best, wherever they are. That's true about a lot of companies in the
United States.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Isn't it also true that America is one of the few places where genius
can flourish?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: That is right. So it would be horrendous, not just for the U.S.
but for the world, if you stopped the geniuses from coming. But there's
another point: For the last decade or so American culture -- the public
culture, the TV culture, the mass culture -- has been kind of hostile to
genius.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: They're hostile to all achievement.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Correct. You, of course, have been the leader in making the case
against this hostility in our culture. But the schools are amazingly hostile
to genius. The result has been that American culture does not produce as
many of these people as it did in the past. Asians who come over and can
hardly read the language are thus immune to most of the seductions of the
welfare state and to the seductions of the imperial National Education Association
establishment. These newcomers dominate the schools [and ignore] all these
distractions -- while Americans are so attuned to the anti-achievement culture
that they regard these activities as beneath them.<BR>
	So the immigrants, ultimately, will help. You get these people in high
schools winning the valedictorian awards and going to the best colleges.
It creates a competitive counterforce that I think will regenerate American
culture.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Back to this resentment of achievement. We have these high-achieving
immigrants now being aced out of entry into various colleges, because we're
trying to not &quot;humiliate&quot; people. We are limiting the number of
high-achievers so as to spread the opportunity around to others. The goal
now is that everybody will pretty much be the same, in terms of equality
of outcome.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: That is, of course, a menace. If you really want to have equality,
you can have everybody equally poor.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: There are those striving for it, even as we speak.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Exactly. And if you have a moratorium on immigrants, you'll be
making a major contribution to it. Because a lot of these immigrants are
very aggressive and creative and innovative and some of them are geniuses
who can revitalize an entire economy. <BR>
	Pat Buchanan -- who is correct about many things -- has, I think, been
somewhat twisted by this aspiration to cut into the unionized lower-middle-class
Democrats Perot is alleged to have attracted. It is chiefly a political
appeal he's making; he's trying to expand the Republican parry. I think
he's very smart. But they've stumbled on a bad one when they seriously talk
about a moratorium on immigration. Not just a slight little error, but a
truly deadly mistake.<BR>
	RUSH: It resonates, though, because there's a new nationalist fervor among
people who believe their jobs and livelihoods are being taken away from
them. I think they are largely union people who've grown up in unionized
homes; that's been the culture that they've been familiar with, and that's
what America always was to them, and now it's vanishing. Union membership
is down below 15%. And those who still survive are having to &quot;give
back&quot; wage gains and benefit gains. <BR>
	They think that anybody who wants to save their livelihood and their tradition
is a great American, because that's what America was. &quot;America was
not the computer. It wasn't the microprocessor, the microchip, or Microsoft.
It wasn't the Internet. America was steel. It was coal. It was the Teamsters
and truck-drivers.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: We had the Korean War. There were bodies coming back in bags, and
three recessions, and people lived eight or nine years less.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: And you had to have a bomb-shelter in the back yard. You had to get
civil-defense instructions, and to see that the drinking water changed every
three weeks in case they nuked us.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: And, in many of these same union families, their parents came here
on a boat and struggled in some appalling jobs, by anybody's standards today.
I mean, to celebrate coal miners' jobs! One of the great triumphs is to
get beyond this kind of work, where people died years younger. It just is
a false nostalgia. Here we had, during this early period toward which people
are nostalgic, two World Wars, the Great Depression, the Korean War.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: It's an economic nostalgia. They remember the days where you, on
a salary of $12,000 a year, could buy a house, and could afford to send
your kid to college, and there were no credit cards, so you didn't go into
debt. And now the average cost for a house is 10 times what anybody makes
a year.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: But the average house is 20% bigger than it was, and 79% of new
houses have air-conditioning.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: So you would agree with the premise that every day in America is
a better day.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Yes, absolutely! And my grandchildren are going to live phenomenally,
incomparably better than we do.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Despite what happened to Don Shula, let me go to one more thing in
your column, because this really intrigued me. You know, if I didn't have
my mind, I would like to have yours. In fact, I'd probably rather have yours
anyway. But you say the current Republican fervor to balance the budget
is &quot;Hooverian.&quot; And that they've wasted a year on this premise.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: When you [make] a balanced budget your goal, you play into the
hands of the Democrats. You immediately put the focus on cutting government
spending. So your whole campaign is perceived by the people -- who get their
information largely from the media megaphones -- as negative. The Republicans
are somehow going to cut spending drastically, and this terrifies the 33%
of Americans who are dependent one way or another on government jobs and
subsidies.<BR>
	So you end up terrorizing millions of people, but you don't achieve anything
of value. Because Democrats succeed: As a result of this threat, they succeed
in mobilizing sufficient political force to stop major cuts. Meanwhile,
the things worth doing, the things people will really enjoy -- tax-rate
reductions, privatization, deregulation, all these positive programs Republicans
should push and  you've been pushing for years -- get lost. <BR>
	So we end up just talking about balanced budgets seven years from now.
Who the hell cares?<BR>
	The last time we had a balanced budget was 1979. It was an all-governmental
balanced budget, and we [also] had a trade surplus. Yet the whole private
economy was in the red. With the Reagan years, America's assets have risen,
since then, from about $17 trillion to $40 trillion. Yet we're speaking
as if the Reagan Administration was some kind of orgy of debt.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Bit is it an error of substance they've made? Or an error of strategy?
Because obviously what they're trying to do is nor just balance the budget.
They're trying to end the welfare stare. They're trying to reduce the size
of government so as to make more prosperous the individual. You would agree
with that, wouldn't you?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: I agree with their visions. I don't agree with their tactics --
and their tactics have now, in my judgment, largely subsumed their vision.
So they end up essentially attempting to achieve something called &quot;balanced
budget&quot; by cutting various government programs. That is a completely
negative formula, and it's political poison. Moreover, it doesn't achieve
any good results<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: But I am in favor of ending a lot of government programs. I'm also
in favor of the American people understanding why. I don't want to have
come up with a strategy to fool the American people -- perhaps, to win,
you must. But I would love to be able to educate the American people, to
say: &quot;This program is worthless. It's wasteful. It doesn't need to
exist. We don't need to be paying you to conduct sleigh-rides around herds
of elk in Jellystone National Park. And I'm not going to sit here and take
your job away from you without telling you why. I'm going to make sure you
understand this is not a function of government.&quot;<BR>
	Is that strategy a guaranteed loser, because so many people have now been
indoctrinated to the degree that they depend on government, and panic if
they think it's not going to be there?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: I think you have to start by cutting tax rates. Big tax- rate reductions
would be entirely positive. They would pay for themselves. They would enrich
the country. They would make Republicans popular -- despite what the polls
happen to say.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: The Democrats would do the same thing, though. They would call them
tax cuts for the rich, and you'd still have the same arguments that are
taking place now. Because Democrats are not going to lay down and let happen
what the true objective is, which is to reduce government, regardless of
how the Republicans characterize it.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: To the extent the goal is defined as cutting back government programs,
the Democrats win. To the extent the goal is defined as unleashing the American
economy, creating huge numbers of new jobs and opportunities, reducing tax
rates, deregulating bureaucracy, we win. The focus on the balanced budget
is a mistake, and this mistake was imposed on the party by a pollster. Politicians
who follow public-opinion polls earn the contempt of the public. And that
is the big danger today, because Republicans on television most of the time
are saying something about a balanced budget that isn't true.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Such as?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Such as, that it will greatly lower interest rates and produce
all these marvelous benefits. This could be achieved by tax cuts, but [not]
by the balanced-budget process -- because you have to begin by saying tax
cuts cost revenue, which is nonsense. Republicans from the beginning agreed
to accept the static budgeting method, that tax cuts don't affect economic
behavior. Tax cuts increase revenue, as you've explained endlessly, but
this still hasn't penetrated beyond your audience.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Well, they're even afraid to defend the Reagan years on that. But,
if you get rid of the deficit, haven't you freed up a pool of anywhere from
$150 billion to $300 billion that doesn't have to be borrowed by government
and, as such, won't money be in greater supply? Therefore, supply-and-demand
would dictate interest rates would come down?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: That's an accounting view of the economy. There's another view,
which focuses on asset values. As John Rutledge at the Claremont Institute
in California explains, we have something like $40 trillion of assets in
the American economy. Those numbers  you're using, relating to the flow
of funds into the federal government, are picayune compared to the immense
changes in asset-values that go on in response to different government policies.
If you cut tax rates, asset-values in general increase. And they increase
not by a few hundred billion dollars, but by trillions of dollars. <BR>
	Money is relevant only as a symbol of productive services that somebody
has offered. This idea that somehow you can I unleash new money which will
automatically expand the economy is the fallacy of demand-side economics
-- and I know you oppose that. Bur the balanced-budget illusion is largely
based on demand-side calculations.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: What about the theories, as advanced by Pete Peterson and others,
that if we don't get a handle on it now, the national tax rate is going
to be 84% for a child born in 1990? That Social Security and all of these
things that actually should be calculated as part of the deficit but aren't
[will] bleed the economy dry, with taxation on fewer numbers of productive
people? They say balancing the budget and paying for what you spend is crucial
to keeping solvent all these various contracts we've made with generations.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Several analysts have questioned the basic accounting functions
Peterson and Rudman and that group have been adducing. But, to Peterson,
the whole Reagan Administration was an absolutely catastrophic failure.
He's one of these one-hand economists. On the one hand, he can see liabilities.
But he can't count assets -- the other hand. So he sees the liabilities
of the federal government growing. But he can't see the tens of trillions
of dollars of new assets emerging from these new industries that have been
generated and are now the spearheads of global economic growth.<BR>
	American companies now earn some 47% of all the profits in world economy.
American dominance today, industrially, is probably as great as ever before,
except immediately surrounding a war triumph. This is much more important
than these numbers Peterson talks about.<BR>
	The Gingrich error was to start by cutting -- by threatening -- existing
programs, rather than by starting with the flat tax. That should have been
what they came into office with. Let Clinton make all the arguments about
why we shouldn't have a tax return on a post card. <BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Can the Republicans win in November?<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Sure, they can. I think Steve Forbes is really defining the issues
on which we can win. To the extent the winning candidate really follows
that theme, he can win. What's your impression of Steve?<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: I love what Steve's doing. I absolutely do.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Do you think he's beginning to show some real political aptitude?<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: I think he's learning. I don't know if it's soon enough to overcome
Dole's insurmountable lead. It's not over till it's over but, boy, it looks
awfully doubtful for anybody buy Dole.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: A lot of people must tell you this, but you essentially did it
in '94. And you really could greatly change things in '96. I think you could
shape the situation and force Dole to respond to your position, because
you really are the foundation of the Republican Party now. It's a hell of
a responsibility, Rush!<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: Well, somebody has to do it.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Why don't you run? <BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: I don't want the pay cut.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: That's right! But you could make these guys face this issue. They
believe that Reagan's tax cuts were a mistake.<BR>
<BR>
	RUSH: They do, because to them it's a zero-sum game. They have no understanding
of the expansion capabilities of people keeping what they earn. George,
let's talk again.<BR>
<BR>
	GILDER: Obviously, any time.<BR>

From the automobile to the television set, technological breakthroughs often
have demanded legislative breakthroughs. This is an era of profound and
far reaching breakthroughs in wireless communications. I congratulate Senator
Pressler for rising to this technological challenge by providing the necessary
legislative breakthrough: a set of proposals for spectrum reform that will
go far toward opening the way to dramatic advances in spectrum technology.
I fervently support his five major initiatives--spectrum privatization,
spectrum management cooperatives, spectrum bloc grants to states, federal
spectrum convergence under the FCC, and most important of all, flexible
frequency sharing, as opposed to exclusive frequency assignments.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A crucial complement to the Pressler proposals is is the conversion of broadcasters--now
endowed as spectrum hoarders and analog polluters--into more efficient and
profitable users of cable coax and the limitless infrared spectrum of fiber
optics. As Nicholas Negroponte has been pointing out for the last six years
or more, in his famous proposal for a &quot;Negroponte Switch,&quot; broadcasters
should moue onto wires and voice telephony into the air<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As Paul Baran formerly at IBM and now at Sun observed in his keynote speech
to the Marconi Centennial Symposium in Italy, &quot;The major spectrum hog
[and spectrum problems is analog broadcast TV transmission.&quot; Senator
Dole also targeted this problem in a bold speech tow months ago. Congress
could give every existing broadcaster free access to cable at a cost at
least $70 billion lower than the cost of letting broadcast tycoons have
exclusive control of 485 megahertz of prime microwave frequencies.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Furthermore, Congress should bring to a screaming halt the oppressive new
telecom tax of federal spectrum auctions. If you subsidize something, you
get more ot it. If you tax it, you get less. The US government is now punitively
taxing telecom innovation. As Eli Noam of Columbia puts it, &quot;We can
agree that governments should not subsidize telecommunications under an
industrial policy. We also should agree that government should not extract
huge new taxes from innovative telecom companies.' As Noam points out, this
policy will surely backfire when other countries around the world begin
taxing American telecom companies for their use <I>of </I>the so called
&quot;natural resource&quot; <I>of </I>spectrum. Sure enough, the UN is
now contemplating this global &quot;resource&quot; recently discovered and
sanctified by the taxers and spenders of the US government.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Senators, the air is not a &quot;resource.&quot; It is the environment.
The value of electromagnetic frequencies is entirely created out of thin
air by the inventors of new radio and computer technology. Your job is to
prevent it from being polluted by obsolete high powered smokestack emissions
from analog<BR>
transmitters.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All existing spectrum policies have become obsolete as a result of radical
new technological breakthroughs in wireless telecopy Converging with advances
in cheap and powerful computer technology, radio is now returning to a pivotal
role in technological progress. At the very moment of a fa W ish fixation
with the radio frequency spectrum--aroused by the FCC's auctions of some
200 megahertz worth of licenses for new cellular Personal Communications
Services (PCS) plus an amazing proposed giveaway to the world's leading
analog polluters--new radio technologies are devastating all the most basic
assumptions of spectrum regulation. At a time when the world is about to
take to information superhighways in the sky, plied by pollution free data-planes,
the FCC is in danger of building a legal infrastructure and protectionist
program for information smokestack industries and diesel locomotives.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Even the language used in describing the auction betrays its misconceptions.
Spectrum is described as &quot;beachfront property&quot; and the auction
as a &quot;land rush.&quot; The basic assumption is that spectrum is like
real estate; many people cannot use the same frequencies at once. Radios
are assumed to be infectious, high powered, and blind; each needs to be
quarantined in its own spectrum slot.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
New technologies from companies such as Steinbrecher Inc. in Burlington,
Massachusetts, Airnet in Melbourne, Florida, Motorola in Schaumberg, Ill.,
Arraycomm in San Jose, and Qualcomm Inc. in San Diego overthrow this paradigm.
Not only can multiple radios operate at non-interfering levels below the
threshold of noise but they can also see the signals of other users and
moue to avoid them. If appropriately handled, these technologies can render
spectrum not scarce but abundant. These developments make it retrograde
to assign exclusive spectrum rights to anyone or to foster technologies
that require exclusivity. Except for the nearly infinite expanse of contiguous
waves, spectrum no longer shows any of the features of beachfront property.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Think of it this way. In the field of spectrum technology, we are in the
midst of a transition resembling the moue from railroads to cars early this
century. A railroad is hard wired and circuit switched; only one train can
use a particular stretch of tracks at one time. Railroads have to be run
and governed by a centralized authority, overseeing use of a particular
network of connected tracks.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A highway, by contrast can accommodate thousands of automobiles, trucks,
campers, bikes, motorbikes, and vans at one time, each under its own power
and control. What makes the superhighway function without top down control?
Essentially, it's smart antenna technology: human eyes.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Human eyes are smart antennas with a bandwidth of some 300 trillion hertz
or cycles per second of spectrum. Human eyes scan the road and assure that
cars do not collide with other vehicles, interfere with them, or drive them
off the road. With every car responsible for its own domain, a superhighway
can accommodate scores of thousands of vehicles at once, each going to its
own destination.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A receiving antenna is like a pair of human eyes: it converts photons into
electrons, electromagnetic waves into electrical energy. The difference
until recently is that eyes are smart: they have 10 billion neurons integrating
and interpreting their electromagnetic signals. Until recently , radios
were dumb and blind. Thus you needed a separate radio for every frequency
channel or road, and you needed to keep the way completely clear of other
vehicles. Broadcasters for example, use obsolete analog signals that require
megawatts of power yet cannot endure the slightest interference; they require
a 50 decibel signal to noise ratio, or 100 thousand to one. Thus these blind
analog radios have to control exclusively their spectrum. Similarly cellular
phones today in the US usually need exclusive use of wide spans of spectrum
and can only reuse frequencies in one out of seven cells.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Companies using obsolete blind radio technology--and experts in the old
analog systems--haue persuaded the government to sell them exclusive licenses
to spectrum. Think of them as railroad magnates prohibiting the use of cars.
You can t have cars on the road, they say, cars will crash into each other,
drive each other off the road. They will speed; it will be chaos. Sound
familiar? I have spent hours at the FCC listening to government spectrum
experts make similar arguments about the chaos and collisions that could
result from a new spectrum regime that follows the inspiration of Senator
Pressler's proposals: his flexible frequency, frequency overlay, unlicensed
frequency, and cooperative frequency management plans. All imply the sharing
of spectrum like the sharing of superhighways or even the sharing of the
air.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I'm sure that if the FCC had to assign an exclusive span of air for each
person to breathe, we would all be gagging and wheezing today. We would
be holding urgent Senatorial sessions to contemplate the crisis of scarce
oxygen. People talk about spectrum as beachfront property., If the FCC controlled
beach sand, we would all be running out of silicon for our microchips.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For a different model, contemplate the 40 million cordless phones in the
US, all sharing the same tiny sliver of spectrum with burglar alarms and
other appliances without significant interference. Consider the scores of
thousands of unlicensed user of the ISM bands (Industrial, Scientific, and
Medical), using spread spectrum technology to share frequencies. Then consider
the rapidly advancing technology of smart radios--radios with antennas like
eyes that can scan broad ranges of frequencies and use whatever lanes or
slots are open on the highway.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Digital radios can function with a signal to noise ratio under 10 to one--ten
thousand times lower than analog broadcasts. These smart digital radios
change wireless from a radio business to a computer business, and that makes
all the difference. With smart radios, it makes no more sense to award exclusive
frequencies than to award exclusive rights to the air.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Smart radios--often called software radios or broadband digital radios--are
the hottest single technology in wireless. The leading technical publication
in the field, EEE Communications magazine, recently devoted an entire issue
to them, noting in the editor's introduction that several articles had been
withdrawn at the last minute because they contained crucial business secrets.
Donald Cox of Stanford University--formerly Bellcore's inventor of PCS technology--predicts
that over the next five years these technologies will reduce the average
capital cost of a cellular customer from $5555 to $14. Last month the pioneering
smart radio company--Steinbrecher Corporation of Burlington, Mass.--was
bought for $93 million by the fastest growing major telecommunications equipment
supplier, Tellabs.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Over the next five years, smart radio equipment will completely obsolete
all the assumptions that currently govern spectrum policy. Broadband basestations
that can handle a large variety of frequencies, protocols, and modulation
schemes will proliferate around the world, allowing bandwidth on demand
for internet access anywhere and for cheap new wireless local loops.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Even the technical difference between wires and air will largely disappear
with the emergence of space division multiple access technology which can
isolate a single call in a cell. Both wires and air will be seen as channels
for photons. Some photons will run at infrared frequencies down fibers with
limitless bandwidth over long distances, and some photons will link through
the air to local base stations at microwave frequencies for mobility. Senator
Pressler's visionary proposals are a crucial first step to this new of digital
wireless communications.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
By contrast, the FCC is fostering a real estate paradigm for the spectrum.
You buy or lease spectrum as you lease a spread of land. Once you have your
licence, you can use it anyway you want as long as you don't unduly disturb
the neighbors. You rent a stretch of beach and build a wall.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With these technologies available, however, the FCC should not be giving
exclusive rights to anyone who makes the highest bid. Instead, it should
be imposing a heavy burden of proof on any service provider with blind or
high powered systems who maintains that he cannot operate without an exclusive
license, who wants to build on the beach and keep everyone else out of the
surf. In coming years, it may even be appropriate for the FCC to make all
the proponents of Time Division Multiple Access, whether in the American
or European GSM systems, explain why the government should wall off spectrum
for them at a time when exclusivity is no longer needed or desirable. The
wireless systems of the future will offer bandwidth on demand and send their
packets wherever there is room.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At the same time that new technologies make hash of the need to auction
off exclusive licenses, Qualcomm, Arraycomm, Steinbrecher, and other companies
also radically attack the very notion of spectrum scarcity on which the
auction is based. Smart radios make it possible to manufacture new spectrum
nearly at will. By putting a multiprotocol-basestation on every telephone
pole and down every alley and in every elevator shaft, the cellular industry
can exponentially multiply the total number of calls that can be handled.
Dropping in price at the pace of Moore's Law, these minicells can operate
at 900 megahertz or six gigahertz just as well as at the 2 gigahertz range
being auctioned by the government. It is as if Reed Hundt is auctioning
off beachfront property, with a long list of codicils and regulations and
restrictive covenants, while the tide pours in around him and creates new
surf everywhere.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Still more important in view of the coming auction, this capability of smart
radios joins spread spectrum in allowing the use of huge spans of spectrum
that are ostensibly occupied by other users. The smart radio can range through
the gigahertz reserves of the military and intelligence services, UHF television
and microwave, and direct usage to the many fallow regions. Together with
spread spectrum, which allows as many as 32 users in a particular frequency
band and cell at once, and which permits 100 percent frequency reuse (all
frequencies can be used in every cell), the broadband digital radio system
changes the very nature of spectrum &quot;ownership&quot; or renal.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Unrestricted to a single band or range of frequencies, smart radios can
reach from the kilohertz to the high gigahertz and go to any unoccupied
territory. As such radios become the dominant technology, the notion of
spectrum assignments allotted in 4887 specific shards becomes a technological
absurdity.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In his speech at the radio centennial, Paul Baran summed it up: &quot;There
really is no fundamental reason for a shortage of UHF spectrum...the frequency
shortage is caused by thinking solely in terms of dumb transmitters and
dumb receivers. With today's smart electronics, even occupied frequencies
could be used...The present regulatory mentality tends to think in terms
of a centralized control structure, reminiscent of the old Soviet economy,&quot;
where everything was scarce.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
We should instead adopt the Internet model that is currently reshaping the
entire landscape of information technology. The Internet accomodated a 1600
percent rise in traffic in 1995 without breaking down. In the Internet,
there is no central node, no hierarchy of control, only a heterarchical
system with minimal housekeeping functions at the center. A similar system
for spectrum could emerge under Senator Pressler's visionary proposals for
a new world of wireless progress.<BR>

Congress' Two Trillion Dollar Opportunity</CENTER>
</H1>
<IMG SRC="aredblue.gif" WIDTH="800" HEIGHT="12" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG=

<BR>
Mr. Chairman and members of the Senate Commerce Committee, thank you for
inviting me here today during what is a golden, though probably brief, moment
of opportunity for the American economy and civilization. Thanks to the
nature of new technologies and a dawning political awareness that these
technologies have overturned the logic of regulation, Congress has the chance
to free American industry to lead the world into what I have called the
&quot;telecosm.&quot; Ahead is forming an environment of unprecedented hospitality
for individual creativity, family authority and economic growth. What this
telecosm requires from the government now is bold deregulation -- a freedom
model -- of telecommunications.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Should Congress fail to adopt a freedom model and persist in the illusory
hope that government can shape the future through regulation, America will
lose up to two trillion dollars of new economic activity -- stock market
values, incomes and job growth. Specifically, unless telephone and cable
companies are allowed to merge or directly collaborate with one another
to create fiber optic systems and digital services in the phone companies'
existing territories, and unless entitlement subsidies and other artificial
regulatory requirements are ended quickly and decisively, financial obstacles
to investment will delay introduction of the pending communications revolution
by five to seven years. Not only will our languid economy lose the massive
two trillion dollars stimulus I am predicting, but America also will lose
its worldwide leadership in telecommunications.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I arrive at the two trillion dollar estimate by comparing opportunities
for high technology advances in the 1990's with those of the 1980's, as
illuminated by research conducted by Michael Jensen, recent president of
the American Financial Association, and his students at the Harvard Business
School. Jensen's research reveals how a de-regulated environment aided in
the industrial revitalization that produced such new or reorganized companies
as McCaw, TCI, MCI, Time-Warner, Disney, Turner, and Viacom, and gave a
one and a half trillion dollar boost to the US economy. An even stronger
opportunity awaits the field of telecommunications.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In several books and articles I have described the &quot;law of the microcosm&quot;
which ordains that the price-performance of microchips rises by the square
of the increase in the number of transistors on a single chip. Thus, distributed
single-chip systems grow exponentially more efficient than centralized multi-chip
machines, epitomized by the mainframe computer. It is this law of the microcosm
that has revolutionized technological change in the past fifteen years,
and through it, our economy.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now the law of the microcosm is converging with the &quot;law of the telecosm.&quot;
This law ordains that the value and performance of a network of computers
rises apace with the square of the increase in the number of computers linked
to it. As these forces fuse, the world of computers and communications rides
an exponential rocket.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Among the wonders awaiting us in the telecosm is, for example, a &quot;teleputer&quot;
that combines, in one unit, interactive video and telecommunications. It
will replace today's televisions and telephones and lend the users access
to a vast world-wide network of other teleputers: mass communication when
desired, but, more often, highly personalized entry to libraries of texts,
libraries of films, Internet-style forums, teleconferencing from home to
home or home to office, interactive distance learning, virtual family gatherings,
telemedicine and huge new business markets -- all brought within the reach
of ordinary Americans, not just the rich. By making the choices we want,
moreover, rather than the choices someone in a studio or bureaucracy wish
to impose upon us, the frustrated American citizen will gain new authority
and enthusiasm about his ability to affect his work, entertainment, education
and even his government. For merely one small example: just as C-Span circumvents
broadcast producers and brings certain events in Congress directly to viewers,
in the telecosm the viewer will decide on his own which floor action and
which of many committees to &quot;attend&quot; via his teleputer -- including
hearings like this one.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Participation in the telecosm will be affordable for ordinary citizens.
But the initial structural investments will be large for the system developers.
The most expensive part of the conversion to the telecosm is establishing
broadband connections to millions and millions of homes, where, not coincidentally,
the bulk of the new personal computers are to be found. Fortunately, the
United States, almost alone in the world, already has these connections
in place in the form of cable TV.<BR>

But cable TV is not likely to survive long in its present state. New technology
-- DBS (Direct Broadcast Satellite), in this case -- is going to blow away
the existing cable companies unless Congress permits them to operate freely.
Currently, cable is a classic example of outdated government regulation
wrongly premised on the danger of monopoly. Cable's hope is to find a new
use. And that new use, in fact, is available, thanks to the needs of telephone
companies -- whose own monopoly of local service is already disappearing,
also in the face of new technologies. Telephone companies require a way
to enter the home to provide broadband connections to the teleputer and
other services, but duplicating cable's connections is an obvious waste
of years of time and hundreds of billions of dollars. New technology thus
closes off old monopoly advantages and opens opportunities for free market
collaboration.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Bringing broadband digitally switched services over cable wires to the home
will still require investments of $l00-300 billion, but these can be and
should be provided by the private sector, without government subsidies or
guarantees. There is no knowing in advance which companies will succeed
in the telecosm and it is futile and counterproductive for government to
guess. The once-legitimate concern about communications monopolies has been
silenced by the centrifugal force of the computer chip. Bigness no longer
assures success in telecommunications, and trying to protect one industry
or company against another when no one can tell which one will survive,
in any case, will only make the needed investments unpromising financially
and set back the movement into the telecosm by five to seven years, well
into the 21st century. On the other hand, if Congress will stop focusing
on how to fine tune regulations and focus instead on eliminating them more
completely, we can have the teleputer and similar revolutionary devices
within the next three years, which -- I might mention -- is within the terms
of many of you in this room. The secret, as Cal Tech Professor Carver Mead
says, is to &quot;listen to the technology.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The futility of regulation is further underscored by the likely creation
of new companies outside any presently foreseen regulatory framework. Either
these information service newcomers will have a government-sanctioned advantage
over regulated companies or the government will find a way to draw the newcomers
into its regulatory grasp -- and perhaps with them, whole previously unregulated
areas of the economy, such as computers and software.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Government regulation supposedly claims to protect competition, of course,
but it is the kind of competition where nobody wins and nobody loses. Such
guarded competition will prevent the restructuring and profit incentives
that must be available to make large investments possible. Only competition
that permits robust rivalries will bring the teleputer and other inventions
on-line swiftly.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Mr. Chairman, last year I was concerned that the Congress was still trying
to develop a regulatory regime based on an outdated belief in natural monopolies
in telecommunications. But, this year I am more hopeful, particularly after
production of the discussion draft advanced recently by Republicans members
of this Committee. Now, indeed, it seems that almost the whole federal government,
including the Executive Branch, is beginning to hum the music of telecom's
de-regulation. But it is not altogether obvious that all of them have bothered
to learn the words. One test of whether claims of de-regulation are valid
is to see whether a proposed law has been adjusted to acknowledge emerging
technologies or whether it still tries to force new technologies to fit
old government regulations. Even the admirable discussion draft the committee
majority produced, I think, should be examined in this light.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For example, consider the issue of universal service. The basic problem
of universal service is that with current wireline telephony and cable TV,
it costs many times as much to serve rural customers as urban customers.
But, new wireless digital technologies have overthrown this problem. At
a time when all voice telephony is rapidly moving to wireless, new digital
cellular systems will soon lower the price of wireless telephony tenfold
and totally close the cost gap between rural and urban customers. This removes
the need for either cross subsidies or universal service requirements.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, as I mentioned, Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS) already delivers
service superior to cable TV with supreme universality across the entire
continent and completely discredits the idea that cable TV is a monopoly
or that hundreds of channels of video will be restricted to favorite areas.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All these examples of technology rendering regulations obsolete should lead
us to the conclusion, then, that the only sound telecommunications policy
is the freedom model. A freedom model would allow all existing companies
-- and new ones yet to be created -- to buy and sell and enter each others'
businesses without undue government interference or delay, granting only
common carrier status in return. It would remove restrictions to cross-ownership
of cable and telephone lines. It would not force companies to separate their
functions unnaturally -- and unprofitably -- into subsidiaries. It would
not impose delayed entry schedules and other invidious tests upon competition.
And, of course, it would not demand universal service or other hidden entitlements.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A freedom model, however, would restrict the powers of state public utility
commissions to regulate investment and depreciation rules, to ensure rate
re-balancing and pricing flexibility. Both cable and telephone companies
should be free of pricing restrictions to encourage investment and to eliminate
the current cross subsidies that discourage competition and the introduction
of new services.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Mr. Chairman, the freedom model of de-regulation is not likely to be any
company's or industry's first choice. Each, of course, would like to preside
over a government-protected monopoly and to enjoy government restrictions
on its competition. That is human nature. But since you cannot possibly
grant special advantages to everybody, it would seem logical that free and
open competition should be accepted as each lobby's second choice. But for
the public interest, I would suggest, the freedom model should be acclaimed
as the logical first choice -- and adopted, accordingly, by this Committee
and the Congress.

<B>George Gilder is a Senior Fellow at Discovery Institute</B> where he
directs Discovery's program on <A HREF="hightech.html">high technology and
public policy</A>. <BR>
<BR>
Born in 1939 in New York City, Mr. Gilder attended Exeter Academy and Harvard
University. At Harvard he studied under Henry Kissinger and helped found
Advance, a journal of political thought, which he edited and helped to re-establish
in Washington, D.C. after his graduation in 1962. During this period he
co-authored (with Bruce Chapman) a political history, <I>The Party That
Lost its Head.</I> He later returned to Harvard as a fellow at the Kennedy
Institute of Politics and editor of the Ripon Forum. In the 1960's Mr. Gilder
also served a speech writer for several prominent officials and candidates,
including Nelson Rockefeller, George Romney and Richard Nixon. <BR>
<BR>
In the 1970's, as an independent researcher and writer, Mr. Gilder began
an excursion into the causes of poverty, which resulted in his books <I>Men
and Marriage</I> (original version, 1972) and <I>Visible Man </I>(1978);
and, hence, of wealth, which led to <B><I>his bestselling Wealth and Poverty
</I></B>(1981). <BR>
<BR>
<B>Mr. Gilder pioneered the formulation of supply-side economics</B> when
he served as Chairman of the Lehrman Institute's Economics Roundtable, as
Program Director for the Manhattan Institute, and as a frequent contributor
to A.B. Laffer's economic reports and the editorial page of the <I>Wall
Street Journal</I>. In the 1980's he also consulted leaders of America's
high technology businesses. <B>According to a recent study of speeches,
Mr. Gilder was President Reagan's most frequently quoted living author.</B>
<BR>
<BR>
The investigation into wealth creation led Mr. Gilder into deeper examination
of the lives of present-day entrepreneurs, culminating in many articles
and a book, <I>The Spirit of Enterprise </I>(1986). The book was recently
revised and expanded for publication in 1992. That many of the most interesting
current entrepreneurs were to be found in high technology fields also led
Mr. Gilder, over several years, to examine these fields in depth. In his
bestselling work, <I>Microcosm</I> (1989), he explored the quantum roots
of the new electronic technologies. A subsequent best selling book, <I>Life
After Television</I>, published first as a Whittle Communications monograph
and then republished by W.W. Norton (1992), is a prophecy of the future
of computers and telecommunications. <B><I>Life After Television</I> was
recently updated and a new forward included when it was republished in 1994</B>.
This book, in turn, is a prelude to his forthcoming book on the future of
telecommunications, <I>Telecosm</I> (expected in early 1996). <BR>
<BR>
<B>In 1986, President Reagan gave George Gilder the White House Award for
Entrepreneurial Excellence</B>. Mr. Gilder participates in national and
international conferences and is<A HREF="ggindex.html"> a contributing editor
of Forbes ASAP, and a writer of articles on high technology for Forbes magazine</A>
and other journals and newspapers. In addition, he is often requested to
testify before the U.S. Senate and U.S. House on various telecommunications
issues. <BR>
<BR>
He operates jointly from the Seattle headquarters of Discovery Institute
and his home at Tyringham, Massachusetts, in the Berkshire Mountains where
he is an active churchman, sometime runner, and, with his wife, Nini, parent
of four children. <BR>

Led by Senior Fellow <A HREF="gildrbio.html">George Gilder</A>, the program
examines how new technologies are transforming business, education, government,
and society. Among other issues the program explores government telecommunications
policy and the role of technology in reforming institutions such as the
legal profession. Other Discovery Fellows working in the program include
Frank Gregorsky, <A HREF="gidari.html">Albert Gidari</A>, <A HREF="katz.html">Roberta

as well as the opportunities, arising in this increasingly influential field.

<B>How to protect the natural environment without sacrificing the human

<a name="intro"><h4>INTRODUCTION</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
The federal government subsidizes lobbying by tax-exempt and other 
organizations through grants and contracts to advocacy groups.  Each year, the 
American taxpayers provide more than $39 billion in grants to organizations 
which may use the money to advance their political agendas.
<p>
Federal funding of private advocacy is not limited by ideological scope.  
Organizations to the left and right of the political center use taxpayers funds to 
promote their ideas and positions.  Almost every interest in America - from 
agriculture to zoology - has one or more organizations receiving government 
funding.  Recipients range from the American Association of Retired Persons, 
which received over $73 million in a one-year period, to the American Bar 
Association, which received $2.2 million.   Over the past forty years, Congress 
has helped create a vast patronage network of organizations that enjoy tax-
preferred status, receive federal funds, and engage in legislative or political 
advocacy.  The days of big city political machines disbursing patronage may be 
coming to an end, but the disbursement of financial dividends to political friends 
is a prominent feature of the federal budget.  As Heritage Foundation Senior 
Fellow <a href="http://www.townhall.com/heritage/staff/breger.htm">Marshall Breger</a> has written:
<p>
<blockquote><Font Size="-1">Lacking the imprimatur of democratic consent, government subsidy of private advocacy can be seen for what it is - the public patronage of selected political beliefs.  That these advocacy subsidies are rarely made openly but are often disguised through grants and contracts for legitimate public functions merely underscores the dangers inherent in a system of expansive government subsidy.(1) </font></blockquote>
<p>
Clearly, the right to petition government to redress grievances should not 
be infringed.  Individuals and organizations using funds from the private sector 
should be encouraged to engage in the legislative and political process. It is an 
entirely different matter, however, to employ the coercive power of the federal 
government to force taxpayers to finance organizations which lobby Congress or 
other government entities.  It is every bit as unjust to force liberal taxpayers to 
fund organizations on the right as it is to force conservative taxpayers to finance 
organizations on the left.  The fundamental principle is that it should be 
anathema to force taxpayers to underwrite advocacy with which they disagree.           
<p>	
Taxpayer funding of advocacy organizations is wrong - fiscally, morally, 
and logically.  It is fiscally irresponsible to spend federal revenues on activities 
that provide no meaningful return to the American people.  It is morally wrong 
for the government to take sides in any public policy debate by assisting the 
advocacy activities of an elite few.  And it is logically wrong for the government 
to fund activities that often result in lobbying for increased federal expenditures. 
The reasons are summarized aptly by George Mason University professor James 
T. Bennett and Loyola College professor Thomas J. DiLorenzo in their 
comprehensive study, <i>Destroying Democracy</i>:
<p>
<Font Size="-1"><blockquote>A large number of  individuals with strong views can express their preferences by contributing funds to a group that promotes that issue.  With tax-funded politics, however, a small number of zealots with access to the public purse can obtain resources from government to advance its views even though few 
individuals in society share the groups philosophy.  Whenever government funds any political advocacy group, it effectively penalizes those groups that advocate opposing public policies and provides a distinct advantage to the group or groups that it favors in the clash of ideas.(2) </Font></blockquote>
<p>
<a name="fund"><h4>THE FUNDING OF FACTION</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
The Founding Fathers recognized the dangers of factions in a republic.  
James Madison wrote in <i>Federalist</i> Number 10 that "Among the numerous 
advantages promised by a well-constructed Union, none deserves to be more 
accurately developed than its tendency to break and control the violence of 
faction."  Madison defined faction as "a number of citizens, whether amounting 
to a majority or minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some 
common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, 
or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community."
<p>
What the Founding Fathers referred to as factions we now call special 
interests.   Instead of restraining factions, however, the federal government today 
subsidizes them.  This distorts the political process by favoring one faction over 
another and by nourishing a network of special interests - a welfare-industrial 
complex - with a direct self-interest in the growth of the welfare state.  The 
financial cost to the taxpayer is far higher than the amount funneled to these 
organizations.  Each one not only lobbies for its contract or grant, but also 
advocates for bigger, more expensive social welfare programs, further 
complicating efforts to put the nations fiscal house in order.  Moreover, while 
these organizations often claim that the money they receive helps the less 
fortunate, the reality is that it bolsters their own political power, perks, and 
prestige. 
<p>
The advocacy network and its leaders contribute to what author James Payne 
has referred to as a "culture of spending" in Washington which makes it 
extremely difficult to trim government programs: "Leaders of such federally 
dependent interest groups  should not be seen as representing independent 
citizen opinion.  They are quasi-governmental officials with a vested interest in 
the spending programs that benefit their organizations."(3)
<p>
Not every dollar given to an advocacy group goes directly to political 
advocacy activities.  However, federal dollars are fungible.  Every federal dollar 
frees private resources to be spent on political, lobbying, and other advocacy 
activities.  Moreover, federal funds make the organization appear to be a larger 
force in the political arena than it would if it were totally reliant upon private 
contributions.  For example, the National Council of Senior Citizens receives 96 
percent of its funding from the federal government.    
<p>
<center>
<img alt="NCSC Annual Revenue Graph" src="1040img.gif">
</center>
<p>
The NCSC is but one of many advocacy organizations receiving federal funds.  
Here are just a few other examples:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The AFL-CIO benefited from more than $2,000,000 between July 1993 and 
June 1994.  According to the <i>AFL-CIO News Online</i>, the AFL-CIO used the 
Memorial Day recess to increase pressure on Members of Congress with its 
"Stand UP" campaign: 
<p>
<Font Size="-1"><blockquote>In those [5 targeted] districts, the AFL-CIO provided radio ads and coordinators to work with local union officials and legislative action committees.  Other activity included direct mail, jobsite leafleting, phone call drives using the AFL-CIOs toll-free hotline, petition drives, town meeting attendance, and letters and columns submitted to local newspapers.(4) </Font></blockquote>
<p>
<li>Recently, the Service Employees International Union produced a newspaper 
advertisement opposing tax cuts and efforts in Congress to slow the growth 
of welfare and Medicare.  SEIU claims Congress is attempting to "loot" 
welfare programs and "steal" from low-income home-energy assistance to 
help finance "corporate special interests." The ad lamented the impact on 
Fannie Johnson and her family in Ohio.(5)  This labor special interest benefited 
from $137,000 in taxpayer funding in 1993 (for an "anti-discrimination public 
education campaign").  Terminating it would eliminate the tax burden of 
nearly 30 families just like Ms. Johnsons in Ohio.
<p>
<li>Families USA - a driving force behind the Clinton big-government health 
care plan, including the failed last-ditch attempt to revive it last summer 
through a nationwide bus tour(6) - received $250,000 from the taxpayers 
between July 1993 and June 1994.
<p>
<li>The Child Welfare League of America received more than $250,000 in federal 
funding, then turned around and launched an ad campaign to increase 
welfare spending.  The League ran an advertisement opposing the Contract 
With Americas welfare reform bill which charged that "More children will be 
killed.  More children will be raped."(7)
<p>
<li>The National Trust for Historic Preservation received approximately $7 
million from the federal government in FY 1994 - 22 percent of its budget.  
In the same year, the Trust "launched a lobbying campaign against the 
Disney project" in Northern Virginia.(8)   In 1993, it "lobbi[ed] Congress to 
expand the historic rehabilitation tax credit."(9)  The groups president, Walter 
Mondale's former chief of staff Richard Moe, said the full credit would cost 
"$1.4 billion over five years."(10)
<p>
<li>The American Nurses Association received nearly $1 million between July 
1993 and June 1994 from the U.S. taxpayers.  In 1994, the ANA endorsed the 
Gephardt health care plan and actively lobbied for it.  According to the 
unions own press release announcing this endorsement, "The American 
Nurses Association is the only full-service professional organization 
representing the nations 2.2 million Registered Nurses through its 53 
constituent associations.  ANA advances the nursing profession by ... 
lobbying Congress and regulatory agencies on health care issues affecting 
nurses and the public."(11)  The <i>Political Finance and Lobby Reporter</i> revealed on 
May 12, 1995, that two new ANA lobbyists had registered.
<p>
<li>The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, which 
received nearly $150,000 in the most recent grant reporting period, 
denounced the House welfare plan, saying it "will drive more families into 
poverty and turns its back on hardworking Americans who fall on bad times.  
This is the small print in their evil Contract on America."  AFSCME President 
Gerald McEntee went on to say that "AFSCME will continue to fight for real 
welfare reform that includes jobs at decent wages, child care, health care and 
education and training."(12)
</ul>
<p>
Actually, however, government funding of advocacy organizations can hurt 
their cause.  Well-grounded public policy institutions prosper from strong 
grassroots support backed by individual financial contributions.  Much like a 
profitable company, they can measure support by looking at how many people 
were willing to open their checkbooks for the cause:
<p>
<Font Size="-1"><blockquote>The plain fact is that political advocacy groups will not flourish on the basis of government subsidy.  Rather they will prosper only insofar as they develop financial roots in the polity.  Reliance on the government trough is no sign of the commitment of your adherents to your cause.(13) </Font></blockquote>
<p>
<a name="prob"><h4>NOT A NEW PROBLEM</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
Federally funded advocacy is not a new problem.  Congress recognized 
the potential for abuse more than 75 years ago when it passed a law prohibiting 
the use of federal funds for political advocacy.  Unfortunately, the prohibition 
was too vague, too lenient, and too weakly enforced.  Put simply, auditing of 
federal grants by the government does not provide the level of scrutiny needed 
to root out abuse.
<p>
The scope of the problem can be seen by examining the <i>Catalog of Federal 
Domestic Assistance</i>, published every six months by the federal government.  It 
details nearly every federal program from which eligible individuals, 
organizations, and governments can receive tens of billions of dollars in taxpayer 
funding.
<p>
For years, congressional offices have worked with constituents to help 
them find federal grants, in the process becoming very familiar with the <i>Catalog </i>
as a guide to sources.  But very few congressional staff employees have been 
aware of abuses in the grants process.  These abuses are long-standing. In 
testimony before the House Committee on Government Operations in 1983, 
Joseph Wright of the Office of Management and Budget noted that the General 
Accounting Office had found problems as far back as 1948.(14)
<p>
In the early years of the Reagan Administration, the OMB attempted to 
revise OMB Circular A-122 (originally issued in the final year of the Carter 
Administration) to redefine limits on "allowable costs" by federal grantees.  The 
revision, first released in January 1983, was widely criticized as overly broad, 
excessively burdensome, and unenforceable.
<p>
One of the focal points of the initial debates was the fact that the original 
OMB proposal apparently would have disallowed the use of any equipment, 
personnel, or office space for both federal grant and political advocacy purposes 
if at least 5 percent of the organizations resources was used for lobbying.  For 
example, a copy machine could not be used to produce flyers for a rally on 
Capitol Hill if it was paid for - in whole or in part - by taxpayer funds.  Many 
nonprofits objected to such clear separation between federal funding and 
political advocacy.
<p>
Months later, OMB Director David Stockman and General Counsel 
Michael Horowitz withdrew the original proposal and released a new draft with 
a more narrow definition of prohibited activities.  This watered-down version no 
longer drew a clear line between allowable and unallowable costs.  Instead, it 
specified a few examples of prohibited behavior, including a prohibition on 
reimbursement for conferences used in "substantial" part to promote lobbying 
activities.
<p>
Unfortunately, this effort to appease federally funded nonprofits and quell 
opposition in Congress was futile.  Because Congress signaled its clear 
opposition to working with the Reagan Administration to curb federally funded 
lobbying activities, despite the fact that all parties acknowledged such behavior 
was inappropriate, A-122 failed to improve substantially the restrictions on 
lobbyists billing Uncle Sam for their activities.
<p>
<a name="proh"><h4>EXISTING PROHIBITIONS ARENT WORKING</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
Federal law prohibits the use of federal funds for lobbying (18 U.S.C. 
Section 1913).  However, there is no clear set of guidelines as to specific 
prohibited practices.  In addition, numerous appropriations riders have been 
offered and approved in the past in an effort to curb federally subsidized 
lobbying.  The purpose of the Reagan Administrations attempt to create a more 
stringent version of OMB Circular A-122 was to tighten the gaping loopholes in 
existing law and to implement Congresss intent in passing lobbying prohibitions.
<p>
Circular A-122 drew on several distinct concepts to frame the new guidelines.  
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Taxpayers are not obliged to fund advocacy they oppose.</b>  The 
Supreme Court in 1977 ruled that taxpayers are not required, directly 
or indirectly, "to contribute to the support of an ideological cause 
[they] may oppose."  (<i>Abood v. Detroit Board of Education</i>)
<p>
<li><b>Freedom of speech does not depend on federal funding.</b>  In 1983, the 
Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the federal government "is not 
required by the First Amendment to subsidize lobbying .... We again 
reject the notion that First Amendment rights are somehow not fully 
realized unless they are subsidized by the State."  (<i>Regan v. Taxation 
with Representation</i>)
<p>
<li><b>The Internal Revenue Code does not alleviate the problem.</b>  The 
notice of the request for public comment on the second revision of A-
122 notes that current IRS rules threaten tax-preferred organizations 
only if they exceed defined limits on lobbying.  However, the limits are 
not tied in any way to the receipt of federal funds, leading to many of 
the same problems from which the 1919 law prohibiting federally 
funded lobbying suffers.
</ul>
<p>
Unfortunately, the firestorm created by the first proposed revision of A-
122 led to a second draft that watered down the tough initial provisions and 
failed to solve the problems outlined by the Administration in presenting its 
proposals.  The notice for public comment on the second proposal stated that its 
"purpose [was] assuring compliance with a myriad of statuory provisions 
mandating that no federal funds be used for lobbying purposes, and to comply, 
in balanced fashion, with fundamental First Amendment imperatives."  Despite 
the best of intentions, the revised A-122 did not meet these goals.
<p>
A particularly serious provision of the second revision was its 
enforcement mechanism.  A popular maxim in the 1980s was "trust but verify."  
OMB Circular A-122 relied on trust alone:  
<p>
<Font Size="-1"><blockquote>[T]he federal government will rely upon [the nonprofit employees] good faith certification of lobbying time below 25% .... Under the proposal, the absence of time logs or similar records not kept pursuant to grantee or contractor discretion will no longer serve as a basis of contesting or disallowing claims for indirect cost employees.</Font></blockquote>
<p>
In essence, this lack of verification of time spent on lobbying activities 
permits the individual to state that he is complying with the law even if that is 
not the case.  This is worse than the fox guarding the henhouse.  If a nonprofit is 
willing to violate the restrictions on advocacy, surely it will have no qualms 
about certifying it is in compliance with the law.
<p>
<a name="rest"><h4>TOUGHER RESTRICTIONS NEEDED</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
Tougher laws are needed to prevent the abuse of taxpayers funds by 
federal grantees.  There is no excuse for compelling John Q. Public to support 
political advocacy that he opposes.  It is fiscally irresponsible and morally 
indefensible. 
<p>
The following should be essential parts of any congressional efforts to 
curb current abuses:
<ul>
<li><b>Truth in Testimony.</b>  Witnesses testifying before Congress should be 
required to divulge in their oral and written testimonies whether they 
receive federal funds and, if so, for what purpose and in what amount.  
This will permit committees to view the testimony in an appropriate 
light.
<p>
<li><b>No Federal Funding for Advocacy.</b>  No organization that receives 
federal funds should be permitted to engage in anything but incidental 
lobbying activities, except on issues directly related to its tax status.
<p>
<li><b>No Bureaucratic Shell Games.</b>  No recipient of federal funds should be 
permitted to maintain organizational ties to any entity that engages in 
lobbying activity.  All sub-grantees should be treated as if they 
received the funds directly from the federal government.  Independent 
Sector, an organization representing hundreds of nonprofit advocacy 
groups, unwittingly indicated the need for this in a recent report: 
"Although the non-profit organization received a check from the local 
government, the local government may have received some or all of its 
funding for this project from a Federal Community Development 
Block Grant (CDBG)."(15)
<p>
<li><b>Meaningful Auditing.</b>  The Inspectors General of the various federal 
departments and agencies must investigate more thoroughly any 
abuses of current law, as well as new laws passed by the Congress.  
<p>
<li><b>Tough Penalties.</b>  The consequences for violating the prohibition on 
federally subsidized lobbying must be sufficient to discourage 
organizations from violating the standards.  Under no circumstances 
should any organization that willingly and knowingly violates the 
prohibitions receive further federal funding.
</ul>
<p>
Representative Robert K. Dornan (R-CA) has introduced H. R. 1130, the 
Integrity in Government Act, which would prohibit a recipient or paid 
representative of any federal award, grant, or contract from lobbying in the 
following circumstances:
</wl>
<p>
<ul>
<li>In favor of continuing the award, grant, or contract;
<li>In favor of the actual program under which the funds were disbursed;
<li>In favor of any other program within the broad department or agency; 
and
<li>In favor of continued department or agency funding.
</ul>
<p>
The Dornan legislation also prohibits tax-exempt lobbying organizations from 
receiving federal funds.  Representatives Bob Ehrlich (R-MD), Ernest Istook (R-
OK), and David McIntosh (R-IN) also are working on legislation to remedy this 
problem.
<p>
It is difficult to craft legislation that satisfactorily defines prohibited 
activities.  Moreover, any bill designed to redress these abuses must prevent 
organizations from simply establishing separate bank accounts and separate 
names.  To be effective, there must be a definite and complete physical 
separation between all federally and privately funded resources.
<p>
<a name="concl"><h4>CONCLUSION</h4></a>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]
<p>
Taxpayer-subsidized political advocacy represents pure fiscal folly and 
moral injustice.  No hard-working American should be compelled to finance 
lobbying activities with which he disagrees.  The Founding Fathers would be 
appalled at current federal grantmaking.  Thirteen years ago, <i>The Washington Post</i> 
editorialized:
<p>
<Font Size="-1"><blockquote>[W]e agree that there is something disturbing about organizations that strongly advocate positions many sensible people find politically or morally repugnant, acting at the same time as administrators of government programs.  It is easy to believe that the advocacy groups employees will sometimes proselytize the 
programs beneficiaries in ways we would consider inappropriate (though not unheard of) for a civil servant.  Advocacy organizations might also want to ask themselves whether they risk compromising their own purposes by accepting government money, and whether they want to assume the inevitable risk that it might be withdrawn suddenly for legitimate political reasons.(16)</Font></blockquote>
<p>
Abuse of federal grant funds must be stopped.  Tougher restrictions are 
needed to prevent lobbying organizations from obtaining some or most of their 
revenue from the American taxpayers.  Auditing and investigation of federal 
grantees by the Executive Branch must be strengthened.  However, a danger 
always exists that as long as government funds go to advocacy organizations, the 
"wall of separation" will be porous.  Moreover, the less fortunate would be 
assisted more directly by eliminating the middleman who "does well by doing 
good."
<p>
Without restoring integrity to government by ending federally funded 
lobbying, Congress and the President will continue to squander millions of 
taxpayer dollars each year.  Political patronage should have no place in the 
federal budget.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The federal budget provides numerous slush funds that can be used
to subsidize the lobbying and political activities of special-interest
groups. The agendas of these tax-subsidized groups tend toward
bigger government, more spending, and increased regulation. Every
American is forced to finance this system that allows well-connected
Washington-based groups to use taxpayer funds to advance political
causes to which many Americans object. Congress can put a stop
to subsidized politicking by refusing to fund the most egregiously
abused programs.

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In 1995, Congress attempted to address this problem by ending
grants to groups that engage in lobbying. Unfortunately, the restriction
Congress approved applies only to one category of lobbying organizations.
Efforts to erect broader restrictions on taxpayer subsidies for
lobbyists, principally the Istook-McIntosh-Ehrlich Amendment,
were stymied. They should continue in 1996.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	While broad efforts to end &quot;welfare for lobbyists&quot; continue,
Congress also should identify and eliminate those programs that
serve most often to prop up special interests. The best way to
do this is to shut off the largest spigots of funding for big-government
activist groups. Ten programs stand out. Some have been slated
for reform by one or both houses of Congress, but no changes have
been enacted into law. All deserve to be eliminated outright.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In 1993-1994, <a href="http://www.cns.gov/">AmeriCorps</a> employed about 20,000 &quot;volunteers&quot;described as &quot;working all over America, helping people &#173;&#173; person to person.&quot;<sup>2</sup> In reality, a significant number of these
paid volunteers work in federal or state bureaucracies, government-funded
programs, or political action organizations<sup>3</sup>. Moreover, ignoring
the Corporation's mission statement to address the nation's problems
through direct community service, several AmeriCorps programs
have engaged in advocacy and direct partisan politics at the expense
of the taxpayers.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Section 132(a)(3) of the National and Community Service Trust
Act of 1993 clearly states that &quot;any approved national service
position provided to an applicant will not be used to perform
service that provides a direct benefit to any... partisan political
organization.... &quot; But in San Francisco, the AmeriCorps &quot;Summer
of Safety&quot; program organized 40 groups to rally against a
&quot;three strikes and you're out&quot; crime bill provision.<sup>4</sup>
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Elsewhere, one of the biggest abusers of AmeriCorps' mission was
a nonprofit group located in Cole, Colorado, which was supposed
to use its volunteers to help people in northeast Denver neighborhoods.
Instead, according to state records, leaders of the Cole Coalition
sent program participants to hand out political fliers directly
attacking a local City Councilman, Hiawatha Davis. &quot;The 'volunteers'
had to draft campaign fliers and distribute them door-to-door
in April and May [1995] when Davis and [Mayor Wellington] Webb
were fighting for re-election.&quot;<sup>5</sup> According to 21-year-old
volunteer Joseph Taylor, &quot;We realized there was something
politically partisan. The more we began to pose a threat to blowing
the whistle, the more they tried to pacify us. They kept saying...
this was a great position we were in, making public officials
accountable for their jobs.&quot;<sup>6</sup> Although the Cole Coalition
was stripped of its funding, the AmeriCorps program lives on &#173;&#173;
as does the potential for abuse.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In proposing the AmeriCorps program, President Clinton declared
that &quot;National service will be America at its best &#173;&#173;
building community, offering opportunity, and rewarding responsibility.
National service is a challenge for Americans from every background
and way of life, and it values something far more than money.&quot;<sup>7</sup>
Like many other government programs, however, AmeriCorps has not
lived up to its promise. Subsidizing political activism does not
qualify as responsible behavior. <BR>

<P>
<b>2. Senior Community Service Employment Program&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $400 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP) is operated
by the Department of Labor. It provides more than $400 million
in annual funding for senior citizen employment.<sup>8</sup> The stated purpose
of this program, authorized by Title V of the Older Americans
Act of 1965, is &quot;To provide, foster, and promote part-time
work opportunities (usually 20 hours per week) in community service
activities for low income persons who are 55 years of age and
older. To the extent feasible, the program assists and promotes
the transition of program enrollees into unsubsidized employment.&quot;<sup>9</sup>
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	States, national nonprofits, and territories are eligible to receive
grants. In reality, however, 78 percent (more than $320 million)
of SCSEP grant money is segregated from state funding to subsidize
nine national nonprofit organizations. The <I>Catalog of Federal
Domestic Assistance</I> states explicitly that &quot;The Department
[of Labor] annually renews grant agreements. There are no plans
to add additional organizations.&quot; Moreover, &quot;Awards
are not on a competitive basis.&quot;<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Fortunately, the FY 1996 House Appropriations Committee report
begins to address this problem. Although the program's funding
was reduced by only $50 million in the House proposal, the report
states that &quot;The Committee has funded the program under the
basic law rather than continuing the past practice of earmarking
78% of the funds for national contractors and 22% for the states.&quot;
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Even under this reform, however, the nine recipient organizations
are not prohibited from receiving funds. They simply are thrown
into the same pot as the states, and federal bureaucrats might
be able to award the grants in a similar fashion. To stop the
potential for abuse, these organizations should be cut off entirely.
<BR>

<P>
<b>3. Legal Services Corporation&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $400 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) was established by the Legal
Services Corporation Act of 1974 to provide free legal assistance
to the indigent in civil, non-criminal matters. Its origins lie
in President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty, specifically with
the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), which in 1965 began
making direct grants to local legal aid organizations.<sup>10</sup><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Corporation uses its budget (currently $400 million) to funnel
federal tax dollars to 323 private groups around the country.
These taxpayer-funded legal groups then engage in political and
lobbying activities, often at the expense of the genuine legal
services needed by poor people. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Legal Services suffers from an institutionalized ideological bias.
Its attorneys regularly promote racial preferences and illegal
immigration. Its grantees are sufficiently politicized to become
involved in congressional redistricting, litigation, and campaigning
on ballot referendum questions. Over the past 30 years, the LSC
has been the legal pillar of the welfare state. Through litigation,
advocacy, and lobbying, it has helped to generate hundreds of
billions of dollars in increased local, state, and federal welfare
spending and the addition of millions of people to the welfare
rolls<sup>11</sup>. It has sued to stop welfare reform in New Jersey and in
other states. It even has engaged in actions &#173;&#173; litigating
to prevent the eviction of drug dealers from public housing, for
example &#173;&#173; that harm the poor. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The LSC clearly has abandoned its mission to such a degree that
no meaningful reform can be enacted. There is only one way to
end this glaring abuse of the taxpayers' funds and trust: abolish
the LSC.<BR>

<P>
<b>4. Title X Family Planning&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $189 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Perhaps a more accurate name for these multiple slush funds would
be &quot;Planned Parenthood Planned Giving Programs.&quot; Despite
the fact that much of Planned Parenthood's agenda is repulsive
to large numbers of Americans, this high-profile political organization
receives a substantial portion of its revenue each year through
government &quot;contributions.&quot; Planned Parenthood and its
affiliates join with a handful of other active organizations in
taking advantage of these costly grant programs. <BR>

<P>
The key components of Title X include:
<P>
<b>Family Planning Services/Umbrella Councils ($183 Million)</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Among the organizations funded under this heading are Planned
Parenthood of Wisconsin ($2.6 million), Planned Parenthood of
Minnesota ($2.3 million), the New Jersey Family Planning League
($4.2 million), and the California Family Planning Council ($11.7
million).<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	These nonprofit groups receive $62.6 million &#173;&#173; one-third
of the total annual allocation. However, much of the remaining
$120.4 million is likely to benefit similar nonprofits. According
to the <I>Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance</I>, &quot;Projects
include: (1) A State Health Department which subcontracts to service
providers throughout an entire State; and (2) a service provider
to serve several counties or a smaller geographical area.&quot;
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Accordingly, many states will subgrant or subcontract with nonprofits
that engage in lobbying all levels of government.<BR>

<P>
<b>Personnel Training ($5 Million)</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The stated purpose of this program is &quot;To provide training
to Title X project staffs; to improve utilization and career development
of paraprofessional and paramedical manpower in family planning
services, particularly in rural areas. &quot;<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The notice in the <I>Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance</I>
states that &quot;funds may not be used in programs where abortion
is a method of family planning.&quot; This prohibition notwithstanding,
at least 20 percent of these funds was allocated to Planned Parenthood
chapters and family planning councils that typically deal with
abortion and engage in legislative or political advocacy.<BR>

<P>
<b>Service Delivery Improvement ($500,000)</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The stated purpose of this program is &quot;To promote service
delivery improvement through research studies, and application
of knowledge.&quot; <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Examples of previous funding include studies of factors influencing
women to discontinue attending family planning clinics and studies
of particular family planning needs of underserved subgroups of
low-income women. In other words, the principal purpose of this
half-million dollar program is to discover why people are not
demanding even more government-subsidized services.<BR>

<P>
<b>5. National Endowment for the Humanities&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $180 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The <a href="http://www.neh.fed.us/">National Endowment for the Humanities</a> actively promotes a
liberal political and ideological agenda. In recent years, it
consistently has funded politically correct projects, including
the highly controversial National History Standards that were
denounced by former NEH Chair Lynne Cheney and other serious scholars.
These so-called standards took political correctness to a new
level by ignoring major events in American history that fail to
bolster the liberal academic's world view. Simply put, the recent
work of the NEH has served to undermine support for Western civilization.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Abuse of federal grant dollars for political purposes is rampant
in the NEH's most prominent current project, the so-called <a href="http://www.neh.fed.us/documents/natcon.html">National Conversation</a>. At the cost of millions of dollars, the endowment
is subsidizing such special-interest groups as the National Council
on Aging, American Bar Association, and American Library Association,
none of which is any stranger to government grants. Once again,
the &quot;Beltway Bandits&quot; have managed to manipulate the
bureaucracy to tap the public purse.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In creating the National Conversation, NEH Chairman Sheldon Hackney
stated that he sought &quot;a national conversation open to all
Americans, a conversation in which all voices are heard in which
we grapple seriously with the meaning of American pluralism.&quot;
Apparently, Hackney believes that meaningful public dialogue is
possible only if the government intervenes and pays for it to
happen, and that the increasing number of Americans participating
in talk radio &#173;&#173; a largely conservative phenomenon &#173;&#173;
are not &quot;serious.&quot;<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The fact of the matter is that these so-called conversations are
simply a high-profile tool to promote a politically correct agenda.
The NEH describes the National Council on the Aging's grant, for
example, as directed partly toward financing &quot;short film
clips [that] will serve as a catalyst for discussion on topics
such as... crossing ethnic boundaries, and practicing politics.&quot;<sup>12</sup>
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Scattered throughout NEH documents are references to ethnic diversity
and &quot;equality and commonality.&quot; For example, the description
of the grant to the American Bar Association states that its purpose
is to foster<BR>
<blockquote>
<P>
more than one hundred nationwide conversations using legal cases
to explore the meaning of &quot;e pluribus unum&quot; (out of
many, one) through five topics: race, gender, affirmative action,
and socioeconomic equality; the place of religion and religious
expression in the &quot;public square&quot;; pluralism in public
schools and curriculums; immigration and American identity; and
controversial ideas and speech in a diverse society.<BR>
</blockquote>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The effect of establishing &quot;discourse&quot; based on such
an agenda inevitably is to encourage the perpetuation of a liberal
hegemony over American political life.<BR>

<P>
<b>6. Market Promotion Program&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $75 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The stated purpose of the Market Promotion Program (MPP) is &quot;to
encourage the development, maintenance, and expansion of commercial
export markets for U.S. agricultural commodities through cost-share
assistance to eligible trade organizations that implement a foreign
market development program.&quot;<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The funds from the MPP go to support some of the largest and most
vocal special interests in the country. In 1995, for example,
MPP grantees opposed bipartisan efforts to reform farm subsidies.
They fought successfully against the effort to eliminate this
program outright, and they also fought reforms designed to decrease
taxpayer subsidies to farmers, particularly large corporate farms.
Once again, all of these self-serving efforts were subsidized
unwittingly by the American taxpayer.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The few grantees under the Market Promotion Program that are not
special-interest associations are large, profitable corporations
benefiting from a slush fund that moonlights as corporate welfare.
<BR>

<P>
<b>7. Senior Environmental Employment Program&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $45 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Senior Environmental Employment Program (SEE) purports to
&quot;use the talents of Americans 55 years of age or older [to]
provide technical assistance to Federal, State, and local environmental
agencies for projects of pollution prevention, abatement and control.&quot;
Only private, nonprofit organizations designated by the Secretary
of Labor and on the &quot;approved list&quot; pursuant to Title
V of the Older Americans Act of 1965 may receive funding. The
approvals read like a laundry list of special-interest groups.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The annual appropriation for SEE is $45 million, spread out over
approximately 250 grants per year. No matching funds are required.
Funded projects often have provided senior citizens to EPA for
&quot;research and general administrative and clerical tasks,&quot;
as well as for surveys and monitoring projects.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This program provides a dual benefit to the promoters of big government
and increased regulation: Numerous senior citizen groups receive
subsidies for their lobbying and political activity, and the EPA
benefits from additional troops to enforce its regulatory agenda.
According to the Federal Assistance Awards Database System, virtually
every regional EPA office and every division within the agency's
headquarters receives support from these grants. This permits
the agency to evade existing employment caps &#173;&#173; without
anyone knowing.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For example, internal EPA documents obtained by the Heritage Foundation
indicate that in March 1995, the agency's Region 10 offices in
Seattle had more than 50 employees from special-interest groups
on staff, including seven from the National Council of Senior
Citizens and six from the American Association of Retired Persons
(AARP). There is every reason to believe similar situations exist
in every other regional office, as well as at EPA headquarters
in Washington.<BR>

<P>
<b>8. Superfund Worker Training Program&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $32 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This program provides nothing short of direct payoffs to unions
which, in turn, work with their allies in the environmental movement.
Authorized by the Superfund law, these grants purport to provide
&quot;practical health and safety training programs [for those]
who are engaged in activities related to hazardous materials.&quot;
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Much like its namesake, however, the Superfund Worker Training
program is a failure. Despite the billions of dollars spent on
Superfund itself, less than one-quarter of the most dangerous
toxic waste sites have been cleaned up. Why, then, train people
in failure? Millions of dollars are wasted preparing people to
clean up waste sites that never get cleaned up.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The nature of this program is demonstrated by its blatantly political
selection of grantees, which include many of the nation's most
powerful labor unions. (A selection of recent beneficiaries can
be found in the <a href="#appen">appendix</a> to this paper.) The Department is conducting
a program evaluation that should be ready sometime this spring.
It is hoped that this evaluation finally will note the potential
pitfalls of providing more than $25 million of $32 million in
total annual funding to organized labor.<BR>

<P>
<b>9. HHS Discretionary Aging Projects&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	 $26 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This program, administered by the Administration on Aging, is
one of three programs authorized under the Older Americans Act
that serve to underwrite the activities of senior-oriented special-interest
groups, such as the 96 percent federally funded National Council
of Senior Citizens. The stated purpose of the Discretionary Aging
Projects program is &quot;to provide adequately trained personnel
in the field of aging, improve knowledge of the problems and needs
of the elderly, and to demonstrate better ways of improving the
quality of life for the elderly.&quot;<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	However benign its stated purpose, most of this program's funds
flow to organizations that promote government interventionism.
Grantees in 1994 included some of the major groups that opposed
efforts to reform Medicare, including the American Association
of Retired Persons, Families USA, and the National Committee to
Preserve Social Security and Medicare. Other grantees (like the
Child Welfare League of America) stand out not simply for their
political advocacy activities, but also because there is no clear
relationship between their missions and the field of aging.<BR>

<P>
<b>10. Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure Assistance&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;$25 Million</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Telecommunications and Information Infrastructure Assistance
Program (TIIAP) is operated by the <a href="http://www.ntia.doc.gov/">National Telecommunications and Information Administration</a> (NTIA) in the U.S. Department of
Commerce and is a key element of Vice President Al Gore's attempt
to impose central planning on the &quot;information superhighway.&quot;
The program gave out $24.4 million in FY 1994 and was slated to
dole out $36 million in 1995. In 1994, 92 grants were made. Last
year, 120 subsidies were given out to help numerous liberal groups
post propaganda on the information superhighway.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	According to NTIA documents, in 1994, Planned Parenthood Federation
of America received $300,000 to set up a &quot;nationwide on-line
information system&quot; for itself and all 164 of its affiliates.
Likewise, in 1994, a California organization called LatinoNet
received funding to &quot;establish a network of regional field
representatives&quot; and &quot;demonstrate a model for building
a national grassroots information system,&quot; among other things.
<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Organizations that filed proposals and applications for funding
in the FY 1995 process include Families USA, lead lobbyists for
Hillary Clinton's failed attempt at a government takeover of the
U.S. health care system; ACORN, which led noisy demonstrations
in Congress last year; the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation;
and Citizens Fund, an affiliate of Citizen Action, an aggressive
grassroots lobbying organization. While these groups did not receive
funding last year, they clearly are interested in the program
and no doubt will seek subsidies in the future.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The most egregious abuse of the TIIAP program was discovered last
fall. A $200,000 grant was provided to an online bulletin board
called <a href="http://www.handsnet.org/">HandsNet</a> to establish a training center and recruit additional
advocacy organizations to its ranks. <BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; An examination of postings on the <a href="http://www.handsnet.org/">HandsNet Internet site</a>, makes
it clear that the group's principal purpose is political advocacy.
The site has been used in recent months to fight welfare reform
and the Istook-McIntosh-Ehrlich Amendment to end taxpayer-subsidized
political corruption, among other issues. HandsNet offers three
key information services: Action Alerts, a Weekly Digest that
summarizes the Alerts, and daily updates on key issues. Members
of HandsNet include such liberal special interests as the Children's
Defense Fund, the Alliance for Justice, OMB Watch, and Families
USA.<BR>

<P>
<b>CONCLUSION</b><BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Government funding of political activism is indefensible. Yet
hundreds of groups now receive government grants which are used,
and used effectively, to subsidize their political activities.
Americans deserve better treatment of their hard-earned tax dollars.
Funneling millions of dollars in public subsidies to special interests
to subsidize political advocacy qualifies as a significant abuse
of the public's money and the public trust.<BR>

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Congress should continue to consider ending all government grants.
But in the meantime, it can reduce government-subsidized politicking
significantly by eliminating funding for those programs most abused
by political activists.<BR>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96b1.html">February 7</a>

entail for them. 
<p>
<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96b2.html">February 14</a>
<dd>This show celebrated Valentine's Day with a new slant on what many consider to 
be true romance: abstinence. Saving sex for marriage seems to be an increasing 
trend, and this show introduced some people who explained this 
not-so-old-fashioned phenomenon. 
<p>
<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96b3.html">February 21</a>
<dd>This show discussed one of the hottest family
issues nationwide and in Washington, D.C., parental rights.  What
are parents privy to and excluded from when it comes to their
children's lives and sometimes life-changing decisions?
<p>
<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96b4.html">February 28</a>
<dd>This week's episode discussed how the media influences 
society today. From television to movies to music to the Internet, 
we are surrounded by the media and its control over what we see, hear, 
and sometimes the opinions and decisions we make. Does the media take 
such a responsibility seriously?

<dd>This show brought you a unique discussion about the 
diverse strategies to combat our Nation's war against drugs, and the 
experts who joined in the discussion range from a former lieutenant colonel 
in the U.S. Army, a psychiatrist who specializes in the clinical and 
policy areas of drug addiction, and a former state drug czar.

and life-changing issue for parents and children: adoption. 
If adoption is viewed as the best alternative to unwed 
pregnancy by the majority of Americans, why is it so hard for 
couples to adopt children in our own country?

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96c4.html">March 27</a>

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96d2.html">April 10</a>

and family as we know it by redefining marriage to include gay
unions.

<dd>This show presented some insider information from those

the solutions that came out of it help your children?

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96d4.html">April 24</a>
<dd>This show discussed an issue not often seen in secular news 
coverage: religious liberty and Christian persecution around the 
world. It showed how thousands of people are sacrificing their 
lives for a faith which they refuse to deny because their government 
demands it. Could America be headed in that direction?

<dd>This episode took you to the Stand for 
Children rally, whose name exemplifies what we all hold 
dear, America's children. But the important issue is 
not just that we stand for children but what we stand for 
and who is standing, government or parents.

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96f3.html">June 19</a>
<dd>Unfortunately, fatherhood cannot claim the revered 
position it once held in our national culture. This episode 
dealt with the harsh reality that thousands upon thousands 
of America's children suffer from the absence of their own 
fathers.

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96f4.html">June 26</a>
<dd>Parental rights have slowly diminished in our schools and 
our culture. This episode helped us to understand why parents 
are fighting for their inherent rights to lovingly guide their 
own children.

<dd>In this episode, we alerted parents to a new affront
against America's children as a recent court case was discussed 
which opened the world of pornography to our children over 
the Internet.  Are we losing the battle to protect our 
children from pornography in cyberspace?

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96g2.html">July 10</a>
<dd>This episode shared some key information regarding 
the Defense of Marriage Act and some sound reasoning from a 
variety of experts on why marriage should not be destroyed 
and reshaped to include homosexual couples.

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96g3.html">July 17</a>
<dd>This show presented more experts who brought
their well-researched insights into the defense of marriage, 
and there was personal testimony from a former 
homosexual man who now helps homosexuals who wish to leave 
that lifestyle.

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96g4.html">July 24</a>
<dd>This episode presented a completely different 
marriage tragedy, its possible collapse, as seen by author 
Maggie Gallagher, who wrote the recent best seller, 
<i>Abolition of Marriage</i>. Has our country discarded this 
founding union?

<p>

<dt><a href="/townhall/FRC/net/st96g5.html">July 31</a>
<dd>This show discussed RU-486, the abortion pill, and how

BROADCAST PARTICIPANTS:

Kristi Hamrick - Moderator<br>
Ambassador Alan Keyes - Chairman, The Declaration Foundation<br>
Marjorie Dannenfelser - President, The Susan B. Anthony List<br>
Marty Dannenfelser - Assistant to the President for Government Relations, 
Family Research Council<br>
</ul>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to a special live edition of 
<i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. I'm your 
host, Kristi Hamrick.  Tonight, we will bring you election 
analysis from a family perspective.  What does this split 
decision between the White House and Congress mean about the 
policies that will affect your family?

<p>

We've got some special guests to answer that 
question, but none more important than you, and we'll be 
taking your calls throughout the show.

<p>

With me tonight is former Presidential candidate 
Ambassador Keyes, who is founder and chairman of the board 
of the Declaration Foundation.  He is a syndicated columnist 
and host of his own nationally syndicated radio show, 
<i>America's Wakeup Call</i>.

<p>

Also with us is Marjorie Dannenfelser, the 
president of the Susan B. Anthony List, which is a 
nonpartisan, pro-life political action committee founded to 
help elect pro-life women to public office.

<p>

And another member of the Dannenfelser family 
joins us, her husband Marty, who leads the Family Research 
Council's Government Relations Department.  He heads the 
pro-life fight on Capitol Hill.

<p>

Welcome, each of you, to the show.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Thank you.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I appreciate your joining with us, 
and we will look forward to hearing what our viewers have to 
say to you.

<p>

Ambassador, let's start with you.  As you evaluate 
what just happened in the election -- Bill Clinton has 
returned, the Republicans have the House and Senate -- what 
do you think the take-home message is of the 1996 election?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I think it is pretty clear.
Bob Dole attempted to run a campaign that was strictly based 
on economic issues against a President whose great 
vulnerabilities were on the moral front. It was an insane 
strategy.  I said so for months.

<p>

In the last three weeks, four weeks, he tried to 
shift and talk more about what they called the character 
issues, but it was out of context.  He hadn't addressed the 
moral crisis that this country faces, and so, stupidly, 
pollsters were able to ask people, "Which do you think is 
more important, the issues or character?" when in point of 
fact character is an element of all the important issues, 
and that distinction showed that the homework hadn't been 
done.

<p>

The relationship between America's crisis in the 
family, in the schools, on the streets, the crisis of crime, 
even in the area of health care, you can see the impact of 
behavior that is resulting from the moral breakdown in the 
society.  Every one of these issues is in fact a reflection 
of the moral crisis, and to make a separation between the 
issue of character, the moral issues, and the tremendous 
issues that we face as a people, particularly as they affect 
our family and our kids, this is insane.  But I think it 
reflected the deficiency of the Dole camp.

<p>

On the House side, I think what we saw, however, 
was a confirmation of what began in 1994.  Essentially, the 
conservatism of America was confirmed in this election by a 
President who felt he had to run as a conservative, even if 
it meant lying all the time, and by a Congress that, in the 
end, is in the hands of an even more strongly conservative 
and strongly morally conservative Republican coalition than 
was the case before the election.

<p>

So I think, all told, the outcome of the election 
is a strong message that we had better start taking the 
moral issues seriously.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And everybody was a pro-family 
conservative.  I woke up to NPR one morning, National Public 
Radio, to hear Bill Clinton explain how the liberal, Paul 
Wellstone, is really a conservative.  I thought, boy, 
conservative values really must be playing if Paul thinks he 
has to be one.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

Marty, when you look at the Congress, do we have a 
more conservative Congress?  It would appear from the 
campaigns, anyway, that everyone is a conservative today.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, on paper, I would say 
certainly the Senate is more pro-family conservative.  You 
might look at who won and who lost in the House and see a 
narrow diminution of the strength in the House.  But you had 
a gap between the House and Senate last time, whereas the 
House was the real stronger body taking the lead on those 
issues, and some of them would get tied up in the Senate.

<p>

So I think the House is probably still 
sufficiently strong to push forward on many of these issues 
and now, hopefully, with some of the House members going 
over to the Senate, like Tim Hutchinson and Sam Brownback 
and so on, to add to that strength, they will be able to 
carry through and send more issues down to Mr. Clinton, who 
will have an opportunity to then show us what a pro-family 
conservative he is by signing some of these bills that we 
heard about on the Christian radio ads, and so on.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Tim Hutchinson has got to be a great 
story. I mean, here you've got Bill Clinton from Arkansas, 
and then you have, in his own Senate seat, he cannot put a 
Democrat in there.  We get not just a Republican but a 
conservative Republican.  We don't have a William Weld kind 
of Republican in that chair.  What do you make of that?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, you've had people like 
that getting elected ever since -- in Arkansas -- ever since 
Bill Clinton got elected President.  Mike Huckabee got 
elected lieutenant governor immediately after Bill Clinton, 
and now he is the governor.  He succeeded in the wake of a 
scandal involving the governor.  He was prepared to run for 
that Senate seat himself, but when the incumbent governor 
dropped out, he had to go fill it, and Tim Hutchinson was 
able to step into that void and fill that seat, and the 
trend in Arkansas is very much towards pro-family 
conservatives.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, Marjorie, you track the 
pro-life issue, and speaking for myself, personally, I had 
to be disappointed that the pro-life issues, they certainly 
motivate a lot of people at the grass roots, but at the 
Presidential level, there was almost a vacuum.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What do you see on the pro-life 
front in this election?

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: On the Presidential level, you 
mean, or on the congressional level?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: On any of the levels.  Where is the 
good news for us?

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Well, in several of our 
congressional races, abortion was a very high-profile issue, 
and the Susan B. Anthony List only picks candidates that are 
going to be very aggressive on the issue.  So where there 
are opportunities, our candidates were very forthright.  And 
certainly in some districts it is going to play better; in 
some districts it is just going to play not as well.

<p>

One of our best pieces of news is that Jo Ann 
Emerson, who ran for her husband's open seat in Missouri, 
beat the Emily's List candidate, whose name is Emily 
Firebaugh -- how about that?  And I understand she was.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

We really found that when our candidates used 
especially the partial-birth abortion ban issue, which no 
human being alive can be for partial-birth abortions, for 
the first time they had the courage to talk about it, a lot 
of candidates had the courage to talk about it because they 
knew that everyone was behind them, and their opponents were 
in retreat on that issue, because we focused on challenges. 
We were challenging incumbents, and all of them had voted 
against the ban.  So it worked well in those elections.

<p>

The problem was that there was a very concerted 
national effort to oust all those great Republican pro-life 
women who ran and won with our help, and they were 
successful in many cases.  So we had sort of a wash.  Picked 
up two, lost two.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I was watching CNN today and was 
very interested to hear that the pro-life issue is not 
influential anymore.  Do we agree with that?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I think there is going to be a 
lot of brainwashing garbage going on in the media right now 
in order to camouflage the truth of this election.  But I 
think that the aim of many things that happened this time 
around on the part of an establishment that included a lot 
of Republicans, meaning no offense, was to try to drive the 
moral issues, not just the pro-life issue but the moral 
issues, out of American politics.  They did not succeed.

<p>

I think there was a concerted effort to do that 
during the Republican primary season.  That failed.  I think 
that it was clear at the convention that an effort was made 
from the podium to lie about the real nature of the 
Republican Party and its issues, and that effort from the 
podium succeeded, with the result that Bob Dole never 
consolidated his base and ran one of the poorest campaigns 
we have ever seen in terms of an ability to consolidate 
support within the Republican ranks.

<p>

So I think that there was thinking that said we 
are going to use this election to get rid of the influence 
of these moral conservatives, and it simply did not work.  
And indeed, I think the election results, particularly with 
the defeat of prominent pro-abortion liberals, as I call 
them, the Colin Powell liberals, like William Weld, like 
Zimmer, I think it really put a wrench in the works of those 
people who had written their stories already about how this 
election proved that the moral issues were no good, the pro-
life issue was no good, Republicans were going to have to 
broaden their base by picking the likes of Susan Molinari 
and Christine Todd Whitman.  All of that is laughable in the 
face of the results of yesterday's election.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The Northeast was great.  I mean, 
there is Bob Smith, who struggles to a victory, and then 
you've got the Zimmers and the Welds who don't.  I mean, 
Zimmer took Christine's formula.  Marty, what did you think 
about that?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, it was interesting the 
way the networks were so quick to pronounce Bob Smith dead 
last night.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: They all projected that he was 
defeated early on in the evening -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: They had to resuscitate him.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: -- and he cast himself as Mark 
Twain today, that reports of my death have been greatly 
exaggerated.  But they all made these projections, and here 
was Bob Smith, who had been the champion of the partial-
birth abortion (ban), who had taken heat for talking about 
this on the floor of the Senate, which was not proper.  You 
know, that was not the type of thing you should do on the 
floor of the Senate, after all.  And yet they didn't, in the 
end, really get him.

<p>

And they called another state, the whole state of 
North Carolina, going the other way early in the evening, as 
well, and that came out five points in the opposite 
direction.  So it was very interesting.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I don't know if Bob Smith saw 
it, but I thought that there was a real Providential irony 
in the fact that Bob Dole wanted to be the one who could 
hold a newspaper that had printed a false headline, and to 
do that, he abandoned essentially the prominent position of 
the moral issues.  Bob Smith stuck with those issues, and he 
could have held a copy of the Washington Post that said, 
"Smith Loses."

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, he could have.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I mean, God gave him that 
victory because he had stood firm on the right issue.  I 
deeply believe this is true.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to have to talk more 
about this in a second.  When we return, we will open the 
phone lines so you can join the discussion with tonight's 
very special guests.  You can reach us by the phone, 1-800-
5000-NET, or by fax at 202-544-2405.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i>, where we are coming to you live 
to talk about the election results.  I am joined by 
Ambassador Alan Keyes; Marty Dannenfelser, who heads the 
Family Research Council government relations operation; and 
Marjorie Dannenfelser, who is head of the pro-life PAC, the 
Susan B. Anthony List.  You can call us at 1-800-5000-NET or 
reach us by fax at 202-544-2405. Welcome back, everyone.

<p>

Marjorie, I was intrigued by a comment you made at 
the break about what we should have learned about how to 
choose our issues.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes. I was just following up 
on what Alan was talking about earlier about how candidates 
choose what they talk about in campaigns, and when they 
decide to open the newspaper and look at whatever poll data 
might happen to be out that day and choose that to talk 
about, they are destined to lose, because it never gets 
below the epidermis and you never reach the heart.

<p>

That is what happened to Bob Dole, and it happens 
to candidates around the country, too.  It is not just on 
the Presidential level.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is true.

<p>

We have our first caller on the line.  We have 
Carmen from Flagstaff, Arizona.  Carmen, do you have a 
question for our panel of guests?

<p>

FLAGSTAFF (AZ) CALLER: I have two comments.
Yesterday when I was going to vote, and I asked a lot of 
people that said, "We're not going to vote" -- people in the 
office, people everywhere -- "We're not going to vote.  You 
can buy the electoral votes, so my vote doesn't count."  
They said, "The unions already bought those votes, no matter 
how people vote, so it doesn't really matter." They 
wouldn't even think about going to vote.

<p>

The other comment is that -- I said it in 1992.  
King Solomon said it in the book of Proverbs.  "When the 
wicked are in authority, transgression increases."  So don't 
be too surprised if our moral values go all the way down, we 
see more terrorist attacks, more of everything.  That is 
what has been happening in the last four years.

<p>

But my biggest concern is the electoral vote, what 
people said yesterday.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That's a really good point, Carmen. 
You know, Marty, we were looking at that this morning a 
little bit, about the fact that even though the unions put 
all that money in, and a lot of people had the same idea 
that Carmen did, that a lot of the freshmen survived despite 
$35 million or $40 million worth of onslaught.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: They did. They went out there 
and in some cases created a backlash.  They were pointing 
out that this was a lot of money coming in just to distort 
what they had really done. These were outside groups that 
really had no interest in informing their own constituents 
but rather to create this distorted image to the more 
general public, and it did create some backlash in certain 
areas.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I think there was a concerted 
effort, too, that dovetailed with what the newspapers and 
the television people were doing.  I can't help but think it 
was no accident that you had these wildly exaggerated poll 
numbers, as it turned out, and that in fact the most 
accurate pollster turns out to have been Zogby, who all 
along showed a much tighter race, going at one point to less 
than four percentage points.  And if that had been the kind 
of polling that had been characteristic, then all along it 
would have been portrayed as a tight race with Bob Dole 
fluctuating, and I think we would have seen a very different 
mentality among voters in terms of participation, interest, 
because they would not have had the sense that it was a 
forgone conclusion.

<p>

So the union money plus the media presumption 
about the outcome, I think, helped to induce apathy.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think it did, too.

<p>

Let's take another quick caller.  We have on the 
line Chuck from Ohio.  Chuck, what do you have to say?

<p>

XENIA (OH) CALLER: Good evening.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Hi!

<p>

XENIA CALLER: Thanks for taking my call.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thanks for calling.

<p>

XENIA CALLER: I am a conservative Christian. I 
am also a retired UAW member, so I was involved in unions, 
too, and I am just so glad that I am not working now or I 
would really be raising Cain, because I am one of the 40 
percent that voted Republican.

<p>

I saw Mr. Keyes on <i>Cornerstone Live</i> back in March.
Do you remember that?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Yes.

<p>

XENIA CALLER: You were on there with Elizabeth 
Dole, and it was right after your little escapade in 
Atlanta.

<p>

Well, I voted for Buchanan in the primary, but I 
wanted to make two points.  I was just wondering why 
Elizabeth Dole didn't have a little more influence with her 
husband in this partial-birth ban.  Now, I was wondering 
when it was ever going to come up.  It finally came up.  I 
followed him all over the country on satellite, on KU band, 
and he addressed it to just a couple thousand here and a 
couple thousand there.  He never really nationally exploited 
it.

<p>

The other point I would like to make is, right 
after the election last night, on CBS, Dan Rather thinks the 
Republican Party must pull together and move to the center 
and away from the religious right.  I can't see where he is 
coming from.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What is so ironic about that -- I 
want to hear what you have to say about that, Ambassador -- 
but the voting numbers were clear.  I know we have all heard 
them, that the best bloc of the GOP was the people of faith.
I mean, how could Dan Rather say that?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: This is why Rather wants us to 
move to the center, so we'll lose all the time.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

I was sitting next to, what is his name, Bob 
Fromme(?), I think, who was Torricelli's campaign 
consultant, and he was also responsible for that despicable 
commercial that featured David Duke against the civil rights 
initiative in California.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, that is right.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: And his advice to the 
Republican Party is that you had better go with the Whitmans 
and you better leave -- and I hope you'll follow Keyes' 
advice and do all of this moral stuff because then you'll 
lose.  No, it's not true.  They want us to abandon the moral 
issues because then we'll lose consistently, as Dole just 
did, and I think that is what Dan Rather and his cronies are 
up to. They would love to see Republicans behave every time 
the way Dole and Kemp behaved this time because we'll get 
creamed as they got creamed, in the debates and before the 
electorate. That is their wish, that we should do the wrong 
thing. I think if we ignore them and instead build on the 
base of strong moral conservatism, there is a majority 
there, including especially those people, some of whom sat 
out the election this time because they weren't very 
enthused --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, definitely.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: -- some of whom we still 
haven't awakened yet to move out of the pews and into the 
voting booth.  But we're going to.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: I find it interesting, every 
four years or sometimes even on the two-year cycles, the Dan 
Rathers and people like that have the same conclusions.  
They wring their hands about negative campaigns.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That's right.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: They profess that the 
candidates are not talking about the issues.  But as you 
study the news, you find out that the sound bites of the 
candidates talking about the issues get shorter and shorter. 
I think they averaged about six or seven seconds in this 
most recent campaign cycle.  And then it is the same advice. 
It was the religious right again.  No matter how strong of a 
margin they got with them, they are the ones who were 
causing them this problem.  It is always the same 
conclusion.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It seems to me that Bob Dole and 
Bill Clinton ran the campaign that the media would like -- 
no issues, lots of fluff, absolutely nothing of substance --
and we had the lowest voter turnout since, what, the 1920s?

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes. About a million dollars 
of consultant fees will pay for that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Their idea of negative is very 
strange, too.  I mean, if you said anything at all, however 
true, about Clinton or about Democrats that brought out a 
lot of the negatives, which are there in the record, then 
that was negative campaigning.  But if you had a filthy 
piece like the Schrum(?) commercial, which basically used 
David Duke in order to do what, produce a 60-second slur 
that called everybody who supported the CCRI a racist, that 
is name calling, but they didn't consider that negative 
campaigning.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And they paid him to do that, too.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: That is right.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: I think it is important for 
people to realize how much is working against elected 
officials to do the wrong thing, you know, to make bad 
decisions, even when they are really well grounded in their 
faith when they arrive, they are still going back to their 
districts all the time, everything in Washington trends 
towards making the wrong decisions. The consultants, who 
just basically they worked on a congressional staff once and 
now they have the great position of telling other people 
what to do, I mean, they are not necessarily qualified to 
tell candidates how to run a good campaign. The 
consultants, the atmosphere of Capitol Hill.

<p>

Without the real active involvement of people out 
in the country, that will prevail, without, first of all, 
the faith and then the really active involvement of people 
out there.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It involves people.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will 
bring you more about the battle to protect pro-family 
issues.  Stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>, where we are coming to you live 
with Ambassador Alan Keyes; Marjorie Dannenfelser, president 
of the Susan B. Anthony List; and political expert Marty 
Dannenfelser of Family Research Council.  And we would also 
like to hear from you, so you can please call us at 1-800-5000-NET.

<p>

Ambassador, we were just talking about the fact 
that it is not so often that our issues are not advanced; 
they are not even -- you know, no one takes the time.  No 
one wants to do the fight, giving up before we even get 
started.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Well, I think you see a lot of 
that.  In fact, it is induced in a way by the media, and 
then it affects the minds of folks.  I thought it was a real 
disease on the Dole campaign, where they seemed very anxious 
to give up, I mean Scott Reed giving an interview to The New 
Yorker a week and a half before the campaign ended, that 
came out the day before the election, saying that, "I told 
Bob Dole every day, I put the poll numbers in front of him 
and said, 'You know, Bob, we might not win this one.'"

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I know.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: And I am thinking, what a thing 
for a campaign manager to be doing.  And the very night of 
the election, Nelson Warfield, two hours before the 
California polls closed, issued a statement praising Bob 
Dole for his courage in defeat.  And I am thinking, this is 
crazy, what is he up to?

<p>

But there was this mentality of preemptive 
surrender, and I am glad, actually, that at a personal level 
-- his staff apparently was very defeatist, but Dole went on 
fighting right to the end, and I think his willingness to 
put up a strong fight, not to back off and kind of collapse 
the way, unhappily, Bush did in 1992 was very important in 
helping Republicans to keep the Congress, because it buoyed 
up the party around the country psychologically; it helped a 
lot in California to keep things from getting out of hand 
there; and I think it helped to maintain the sort of 
firewall that prevented Clinton's victory from expanding 
into control of the Congress.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It could have saved the House and Senate.

<p>

We have a caller on the line from historic Valley 
Forge, Pennsylvania.

<p>

VALLEY FORGE (PA) CALLER: Oh, hi.  How are you?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Hi. Thanks for joining us.

<p>

VALLEY FORGE CALLER: When they wanted the Jews to 
repent, they showed the bodies, shriveled, and when they 
wanted people to send to Ethiopia, they showed the bloated 
bodies.  Why aren't Christians putting up billboards with a 
manger scene, with an empty manger, with the words, "I'm 
sorry, Joseph, we couldn't afford him"?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Good point.

<p>

Marjorie, you work on this pro-life issue.  What 
kinds of messages do you find really motivate people when 
you are working on them?

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Well, that was very touching, 
and that was a beautiful way to put it.

<p>

I find, and we have a unique stance at the Susan 
B. Anthony List among PACs.  We really require of our 
candidates that they do two things, that they project the 
justice of changing laws to protect the unborn, and they 
project the mercy and the compassion that we have to reach 
women where they are.

<p>

I mean, the reality of this issue is that women 
have abortions, and when we have women in public office who 
are talking to women on their own terms and saying that they 
have a sense for where they are -- I mean, I think it is 
very important.  It is very important to have that 
connection, and I think it is important to have women 
discussing it in those terms.

<p>

I think what resonates the most, frankly, just on 
a debate level -- I think that ad is a great idea that the 
caller called in with -- but is, what is it?  You know, 
whenever I am debating the issue, what is an abortion?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What are you choosing?

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: What is it? I mean, what is 
that "thing"?   You have to address that before you can move 
on.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Let's take one more quick caller.
We have on the line Kay from Wyoming.  Kay, do you have a 
question or a comment for our distinguished panel?

<p>

RIVERTON (WY) CALLER: I do. I have a couple 
things.  First of all, on the issues, our issues do not lend 
themselves easily to sound-bite campaigning, and until we 
break through that format that we are permitted, we are 
going to have problems getting our point across.

<p>

Dr. Keyes was pointing out about the polls, and 
you have to remember, the American press uses polls as a 
weapon, not a tool.  They try to use polls to change 
people's opinion or to frame it.  They don't use it for a 
measuring device.

<p>

My question, also, is -- the big question is, did 
the RNC learn anything this time around, and what are they 
going to foist upon us in 2000?  Are we going to have 
another left-leaning candidate and more empty issues?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, hours of conversations have 
gone into that.  I would have to say one thing, though.  I 
think that is the strength of NET as a network, to have an 
expanded conversation, and radio shows like yours.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Yes. Well, I think with 
respect to the RNC, we are just at the beginning of what is 
going to be, I believe, a very intense battle within the 
Republican Party between the grass roots, which I believe is 
overwhelmingly Reagan conservative -- pro-life, morally 
conservative, fiscally conservative, interested in 
reclaiming power from the central government and rebuilding 
the institutions of local self-government and civil society. 
I think that is the essence of the true conservatism at the 
grass roots in the Republican Party.  That is going to be 
pitted against the party elitists, the people who controlled 
the podium at the convention this time around, the people 
who had planned consistently a strategy aimed at dumping the 
moral issues, at emphasizing money above everything, and at 
trying to promote Colin Powell, Christine Whitman, others 
who basically represent the abandonment of the Republican 
Party's moral heart. We are at the beginning of that 
struggle.

<p>

I think that for the caller and for others around 
the country, what they have to realize, I think, is that in 
the next several years, we are going to have to commit 
ourselves at the grass roots to lighting fires that can be 
seen from every horizon so that nobody in the Republican 
Party structure or leadership can mistake the true sentiment 
that exists in the party at the grass roots, because it is 
going to require a lot of action; it is going to require a 
lot of persistence and perseverance on the part of people 
who are moral conservatives to keep the Republican Party 
where it belongs and to do what is necessary.  By the year 
2000, we must transform the leadership of the party.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Marty?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: On that point, I think the 
caller identifies a problem for pro-family conservatives 
that people in the major news media, the three or four major 
television networks, the newspapers on the Eastern -- you 
know, we know the newspapers, <i>New York Times</i> and others -- 
do not agree with us on these cultural issues.

<p>

But a candidate, particularly a candidate for 
President of the United States, has a unique opportunity to 
speak directly to the people.  Alan Keyes has done that, 
Ronald Reagan did that. Ronald Reagan faced a very hostile 
press.  We do hear some revisionist history from the press 
now about how nice they were to Ronald Reagan.  But those of 
us who remember the Reagan Presidency know otherwise.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That's right.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Bob Dole and Jack Kemp had that 
opportunity in this campaign, and they had a moderator in 
those debates who was really a very fair-minded journalist 
who gave them some open-ended questions like, "Tell us about 
Clinton's character," or, "Tell us about the moral crisis in 
the country today," between the questioners from the 
audience in the second Presidential (debate), and they had a 
minute and a half or so to articulate these positions, and I 
don't think they did it.  They came around in circles back 
just repeating economic theory and things like that, and it 
was just absurd.

<p>

The other thing is, federal candidates can 
completely control the content of their advertising.  They 
are getting $60 million in federal funds to run a campaign. 
They can choose to do a 30-second spot, they can choose to 
do a one-minute spot, they can choose to do a five-minute, 
or Ross Perot did some half-hour spots, and they can speak 
as short or as long, within certain limits, as they want to, 
and as long as their resources will hold out, they need to 
identify the message and articulate it to the people.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And we are going to have to demand that.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: And Bob Dole obviously didn't 
do that, and he paid the price for it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That's right.

<p>

We're going to have to talk more about this in a 
second.  Following this commercial break, we will continue 
our discussion about yesterday's election results and how 
they affect you.  Please stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. Joining me tonight to discuss 
how yesterday's elections affect pro-family issues is 
Ambassador Alan Keyes, a steadfast leader in the pro-family 
movement, both inside and outside the beltway.  Also with us 
are Marjorie and Marty Dannenfelser.  Marjorie is the 
president of the pro-life PAC, the Susan B. Anthony List.
Marty heads Family Research Council's government relations 
efforts.  We are taking your calls at 1-800-5000-NET.

<p>

Coming back, Marty, a lot of us have been talking 
about who is going to be RNC chair.  Haley Barbour says he 
is stepping down.  Is this the kind of power struggle that 
pro-family people need to watch?  Where is the leadership 
going to come from?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, there are many different 
factions of people around the country, and people have 
formed their own coalitions.  They will look at who the 
members of the Executive Committee of the Republican 
National Committee are in the 50 states around the country 
and try to formulate a strategy for reaching them.

<p>

I think that is something; if people can have an 
influence on that process, it is probably worth doing.  But 
I don't think we should allow ourselves to become fixated on 
that, because the ultimate way that you nominate a candidate 
is at the grass-roots level, is to send delegates to the 
national convention, and it is the delegates who ultimately 
nominate the candidate -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: People who manage leadership.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: -- and then the candidate who 
sets the tone for the party and for the convention and for 
the campaign.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The Bush tone kind of was in our mouth this time.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I do think it is important, 
though, right now to try to work towards someone who is not 
going to be pushing what was, as I said, a conscious 
strategy of jettisoning the moral issues, which Haley 
Barbour was very open about.  I mean, he went around the 
country telling everybody who would listen for a while there 
that we had to get that pro-life plank out of the platform, 
we had to put these issues aside, and they were divisive, 
and all of this.

<p>

We don't need that.  What we need is someone who 
is going to articulate in a persuasive way the reasons for 
the positions that the Republican Party takes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: TO explain what we believe.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Exactly, and to do it in a way 
that will make sense to people and make them realize that 
the things we talk about are the issues.  They are not 
separate from the issues, as the media tries to imply.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Let's take a quick caller.  We have 
John on the line from the great state of Texas.  John, hi.
Do you have a comment or a question?

<p>

MIDLAND (TX) CALLER: Good evening. How are you 
doing?  I've got a quick comment, and then I've got a 
question for Alan.  I've heard all day long on the radio 
that women voted for Clinton because of abortion rights.  If 
that's true, I really feel sorry for a lot of these women.
I have Catholic friends -- I am Catholic and I even have 
Catholic friends that I know voted for Clinton, and I really 
feel sorry for them.

<p>

Alan, I was also at <i>Cornerstone</i>. I voted for you 
in the primary, and I saw you on TV last night, and you said 
something about you weren't a good speaker and you cheated.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Me?

<p>

MIDLAND CALLER: Keep on cheating, brother. We love it. We love you.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Oh, I was joking.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

MIDLAND CALLER: Where does your show originate from?

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: The show originates from 
Rosslyn, Virginia.  We are on 35 stations now around the 
country and building.  So, hopefully, we will reach into 
your area sometime soon.  I hope so.

<p>

MIDLAND CALLER: Thanks a million for your show.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Can I comment for a minute, 
though, on this gender gap thing?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, the gender gap.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Before we even start to take it 
seriously.  I think it's a phony issue.  I do not believe 
there is a gender gap.  I think the gender gap is in fact a 
false symptom of something else.  And the simple fact of the 
matter, which nobody wants to really dwell on but which is 
the truth, is this:  Take Hispanic and black women out of 
the mix, and the gender gap evaporates.  It is not there.

<p>

And what does that mean?  It means you don't have 
a gender gap.  The gender gap is actually a symptom of the 
fact that we have large minority groups, Hispanics and 
blacks, who are captives of the Democratic Party; that 
amongst the white electorate, Republicans and Democrats 
compete pretty evenly still in terms of their ability to win 
the allegiance of voters; but that when you continue to get 
these lopsided majorities amongst Hispanics and blacks for 
Democrats, that produces a distorted outcome.

<p>

I think that is a very telling fact.  I am going 
to refuse to talk about this gender gap thing anymore 
because I think it is all a lie.  If one alteration makes 
the gap go away, that means that the true cause of the gap 
is not gender, it is something else, and this something else 
in this particular case is in fact racial politics, the 
politics of terrorizing minorities, which I think has been 
once again practiced in this election year by the Democrats.

<p>

But I also think it is going to change, because 
the Democrats have lost their base in the Congress which 
they used to buy off the leadership in the minority 
communities, and I think, over time, without the gravy 
train, they are going to have a very hard time continuing to 
dangle things they can't deliver in front of a coopted 
leadership, and people in the community are going to say, 
"Well, wait a minute.  We'd better start making our peace 
with these Republicans because, otherwise, we won't be part 
of the political process anymore."

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That is a fascinating analysis, 
because in <i>USA Today</i> and a Wirthlin poll I saw today all 
agree with that statement that you just made, that when you 
take minority women out, all the other things kind of break 
out evenly.

<p>

And in fact, Marty, is it not accurate that we 
have seen women more pro-life than men, generally, that 
women are more motivated for their concern for life?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: There are. There are more 
women who seem to vote on that issue, but on balance, more 
of those women vote on the pro-life side than on the other 
side.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: I don't know.  I think it is 
tremendously insulting to women to say that if you are of a 
certain gender, you are automatically going to vote -- you 
are going to have this opinion on this, this opinion.  We 
are thinking individuals that differ on all sorts of things, 
and it is more -- my vote has more to do with my core 
beliefs, what I believe in; also, my situation.  We have a 
family.  You know, things like that, not because I am a 
woman, because I am a human being.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think you are right.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: You know, the thing that I 
found striking, two things were true.  One, the lie about 
the gender gap very much influenced the thinking of the 
strategists in the Dole campaign to such an extent that they 
made foolish errors. The Susan Molinari pick was the 
stupidest thing they could have done for keynote speaker, 
except maybe for Colin Powell.  But why?  Because they 
wanted to reach out to Catholics. And what did they do? 
They put a pro-abortion Catholic on the podium who 
absolutely insulted the convictions and work of the 
Catholics who would lean toward Republicans because of their 
pro-life sentiment.  It was insane.

<p>

So Bob Dole ended up getting all the votes of pro-abortion Catholic 
women, right?  That's why he won the election.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: That's right, absolutely.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: He couldn't get those votes, 
but the votes he could have gotten, the strongly committed 
pro-life Catholics, were instead insulted by this notion 
that a pro-abortion speaker speaks for them.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: See, that is what is funny about 
that.  There was no big tent until Ronald Reagan pulled in 
pro-life Catholics and working-class Americans who felt that 
the Democratic Party was becoming liberal and insulting to 
their values.

<p>

The big tent -- I mean, you hear the Haley 
Barbours and Romsfields(?) of the world talking about it.
You would think they created it rather than they just 
benefitted from coming under the flaps.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Well, they didn't even 
understand it.  They are still talking as if the big tent 
has something to do with money.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: And it does not. The big tent 
had to do with the fact that the moral culture of the 
Democratic Party was hijacked by radical left-wingers who 
moved away from the traditional values of the American 
people and lost a lot of people amongst the union workers, 
amongst the ethnic groups, amongst the Catholics, who simply 
were not going to abandon their faith and their principles.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We will come back in a second.  When 
<i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will take more calls and continue 
our discussion with tonight's special guests.  Please stay 
with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to tonight's live 
edition of <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>.
I am honored to be joined by Ambassador Alan Keyes and 
Marjorie and Marty Dannenfelser, both long-term political experts.

<p>

We would also like to hear from you.  You can 
reach us at 1-800-5000-NET.

<p>

We have a caller on the line, Robert from 
Albuquerque, New Mexico.  Robert, hi.

<p>

ALBUQUERQUE (NM) CALLER: Well, good evening.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Good evening.

<p>

ALBUQUERQUE CALLER: This is the first time I have 
watched your show.  I have watched NET for a while.  But I 
like it so far.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, good. Thanks.

<p>

ALBUQUERQUE CALLER: I have two questions.  One 
you have actually partially answered.  Maybe Alan could add 
more to it.  That is, why did the Catholic vote go the way 
it did?  Two, what do you think is going to happen to the 
Republican hierarchy after actually -- I mean, it is pretty 
much common knowledge that they picked Bob Dole, they gave 
it to him, they got him through the primaries, and he lost 
the White House.

<p>

And then I have a comment, if I may.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Why don't you give us your comment 
really fast and then let's get to Alan's answers.

<p>

ALBUQUERQUE CALLER: Oh, okay.  Over the years I 
have dealt and struggled with abortion.  When it first came 
about, I went, "Yippee."  Then as I grew older and wiser, I 
realized that something was wrong here.

<p>

But the argument for abortion has always been, 
you're killing a baby, and that's true.  But I have taken on 
another tactic.  I have looked at these people who are pro-abortion, 
and I said, what gender actually benefits from 
abortion?  And the answer is men.  Men only benefit from it.

<p>

I am beginning to hear a little more about this, 
or talk this way in the media, not very much.  Do you think 
that -- or maybe my suggestion would be that you people 
would take the same course and that abortion does not 
benefit women.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is interesting.  Polling data 
indicates that single men are the biggest proponents of 
abortion, which I think there is a little self-interest 
there.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Oh, definitely.  I think they 
are very anxious to escape their responsibility toward their 
children, and so they are willing to kill the child and 
burden the woman with this awful psychological burden for 
the rest of her life that is involved in this, and we are 
not protecting.

<p>

In terms of the Catholic vote, one, I think we 
always have to remember that we are dealing with a situation 
where Catholics were overwhelmingly voting for Democrats 
until Ronald Reagan came along, and even Reagan's success 
meant that we moved from, what, 20 percent of the Catholic 
vote or less up to around 40, and even during Reagan, this 
is what we reached.  So we are not talking yet, at least, 
about getting the majority of the Catholic vote.

<p>

But I think, as I said, one mistake that was made 
in this election was that Bob Dole thought he was going to 
reach out to Catholics.  They said, "Oh, you've got to reach 
out to the Catholic vote."  And, of course, there was a 
great opportunity.  The Catholic hierarchy, for the first 
time that I can remember, actually came forward in an 
election year against a sitting Democratic President, and 
they were more Catholic than Democrat.  And for those of us 
who are Catholics, this was breathtaking, and I was so 
pleased to see it happen.

<p>

Now, what did that mean?  It meant a great 
opportunity, but to do what?  To reach out to pro-life 
Catholics and pull them in more strongly into the Republican 
cause.  And so what does Bob Dole do?  He chooses Susan 
Molinari, a pro-abortion, outspoken, rabidly pro-abortion 
Catholic, to give the keynote speech, and he thought this 
was going to help him with Catholics.  He's insane.

<p>

What it did, I think, was to take a lot of people, 
and I know, because as I went around the country speaking, I 
have found it infuriated a lot of people.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Oh, it did.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: They just felt deeply insulted 
that he simply didn't understand what was going on, who they 
were, and as a result, I think he actually may have hurt 
himself at that point and not really recovered in terms of 
the perceptions of a lot of the pro-life Catholics and I 
think, also, pro-life Christians who were not Catholic, who 
just felt like, what is this man trying to tell us?  Doesn't 
he understand who his people are?  And the answer, I think, 
was, unhappily, no, he did not, or at least his advisers 
didn't.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, I think that Bob Dole is 
fundamentally an honest and decent person, but his whole 
aura throughout this campaign seemed very calculating.  The 
debate over abortion in the Republican platform was very 
much, now we're going to have it this way, I'm going to do 
it this way, and we have to reach out to the moderate women 
and we can't offend them, so we're going to have this 
tolerance language in there.

<p>

And then he never talked about CCRI for a while 
until, all of a sudden, the last few weeks of the campaign, 
he acknowledged, yeah, we're going to talk about that 
because that's a wedge issue.  And then he didn't answer the 
question when Jim Lehrer asked him about Bill Clinton's 
character during the debate in front of 40 or 50 million 
people, and then he decided to go out on the campaign trail 
and conduct a discussion with the people in his audiences, 
"Should I get tough in the next debate?" and so on.

<p>

Just everything looked so calculating that people 
had to start wondering, well, what does this guy really 
believe in?  I think that is what came across, that every 
position he seemed to be taking was based on some political 
calculation.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Rather than on what he believed.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: And it may very well be that 
Bill Clinton made his share of calculations, but at least 
when he was out on the stump, he was talking about how 
issues connect with people's personal lives.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: Ironic as it may seem, I think 
some people -- and I am not saying they were right in this 
-- but they seem to prefer a sincere liar to an insincere 
honest man.  And I have to tell you that it's a dilemma, 
isn't it?

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: But don't you think that argues for 
something that I think we would be in agreement about, that 
people should stand up for something?  I think we would call 
them to stand for pro-life, pro-family values, but the 
politicals and the Dan Rathers and the Peter Jenningses say, 
"Don't stand for that much because that really offends 
people," when clearly, it draws them.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: I think the chief problem 
among candidates is just wanting to be liked.  It is a very 
basic human need.  But if you are not driven by your core 
beliefs, that just takes over.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: I also think the media is very 
manipulative, because we were talking earlier about negative 
advertising.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: And the truth of the matter is, 
when you actually look at election results, challengers and 
others who are faced with tough fights, they only win when 
they are able to show people that an incumbent is not voting 
their views and values.

<p>

Now, the media calls that negative.  It is 
actually just truth-telling.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That's right. It's a report card.

<p>

AMBASSADOR KEYES: If somebody has gone to 
Congress and voted in a way that betrays the values of their 
constituents -- you have liberals like a Barbara Mikulski 
pretending when they go to the Eastern Shore of Maryland 
that they are conservatives and respect family and all of 
this, meanwhile voting for everything that people there 
hate.  Well, if you want to beat somebody like that, you've 
got to tell people what she is about and what she stands 
for.  And they want to stigmatize that as negative 
advertising, and the only time -- the only time -- when that 
sort of thing is really, really bad, in their eyes, and you 
absolutely must not do it is when you are telling the truth 
about Democrats.

<p>

Now, of course, if you do the same thing and fill 
your commercials with lies, which is what the AFL-CIO did, 
they told untruths about the Republican Congress, but that 
was not characterized as negative advertising.  It's 
amazing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Isn't that funny?  Demagoguery was okay.

<p>

MRS. DANNENFELSER: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: As long it was on Medicare.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, they were fortunate the 
Democratic members of Congress, and to a certain extent Bill 
Clinton, that they had surrogates, in a sense, doing their 
dirty work for them.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Weren't they, though?  They had the union money.

<p>

I would love to talk a little bit more.  I would 
like to thank all my guests, and we are going to have to 
have you back.

<blockquote>



 <LI>Bill Clinton has charged Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle  with the unenviable assignment of negotiating a settlement with Congressional Republicans on the partial-birth abortion ban. His task: get the GOP to exempt  from the ban women whose "health" might be adversely affected by carrying their children to term.  Call it Mission Impossible. Pro-life Republicans know better than to fumble this issue; the Supreme Court has defined "health" so broadly that it includes emotional well-being and maternal youth. And, as Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Penn.) points out, "this procedure would never be used in an emergency," as it takes three days to perform. But given the Republicans' obvious intransigence, it seems peculiar that the President would be so eager to revisit this losing issueunless he fears that the 105th Congress will succeed in overriding his ban. This is a valid concern: Senate Republicans fell only nine votes short of overruling the President in the last term, and in the meantime they have picked up two more seats. Moderate Democratsthose uncomfortable having their names associated with infanticidewill be less likely to succumb to White House arm-twisting when their President is a lame duck, and some have re-election campaigns of their own to worry about in 1998. The hitch is that the President will try to turn the issue against the GOP, chastising its refusal to sign on as gridlock and indifference to women's concerns. 
If Republicans shield their ears from this Sirens' song, however, the public will recognize Clinton's desperation strategy  for what is. Then Congress might just get that override Clinton so fears.

<blockquote>
 <LI> For twelve days in November, French truck drivers went on strike demanding early retirement, shorter working hours, and more pay. They did not merely refuse to work, as is their right, but set up over 200 blockadesat ports, on freeways, and around major cities and oil refineries. Road transport was massively disrupted, stocks of food and gas ran low, and foreign truck drivers, held hostage in the blockades, were compelled to live in their cabins without washing. One British driver who protested was admitted to intensive care after being severely beaten up by French truckers. Throughout the entire crisis, the government insisted that it would not "use force" to break the blockades. It thereby admitted that it was not prepared to fulfill its duty to uphold the rule of law. The settlement with the truckers will cost $200 million, and the country now faces hundreds of millions of dollars in claims from companies abroad who were severely hit. The French economy also suffered severely for the second time in a yearfrom a strike. But this is merely the inevitable tribute which a decadent political system must pay to any interest group willing to trample the common good.

The winner of the Bad Writing Contest, sponsored by <I>Philosophy and Literature</I>, a journal at Johns Hopkins University, is the following sentence from Roy Bhaskar's <I>Plato etc: The Problems of Philosophy and Their Resolution</I>: "Indeed dialectical criticism realism may be seen under the aspect of Foucauldian strategic reversalof the unholy trinity of Parmenidian/Platonic/Aristotelian provenance; of the Cartesian-Lockean-Humean-Kantian paradigm, of foundationalisms (in practice, fideistic foundationalisms) and irrationalisms (in practice, capricious exercises of will-to-power or some other ideologically and/or psychosomatically buried source) new and old alike; of the primordial failing of western philosophy, ontological monovalence, and its close ally, the epistemic fallacy with its ontic dual. . . ." Mr. Bhaskar's stem-winder goes on for 58 more words, but you get the drift.

 Last month President Clinton came clean on Bosnia, finally revealing that 8,500 U.S. troops would remain past the original December 20 deadline. The original deployment of 35,000 Americans had "succeeded beyond our expectations," he said, but a follow-on force, more limited in size and mandate, was required for another 18 months to ensure political stability. IFOR (Implementation Force) will be renamed SFOR (Stabilization Force). The problems, needless to say, are manybeginning with Congressional anger at Clinton's denials before the election that any such extension was planned. More  important, the political provisions of the Dayton Accords, which aim at creating a unitary, multi-ethnic Bosnian state, are beginning to unravel. U.S. training and equipping of the Bosnianswhich the President had promised Congresshas barely begun, leaving them still dependent on foreign troops. The President may get his way, given the difficulty of cutting off funds and overriding a veto, but he compounds all his risks, at home and in Bosnia, unless he keeps his promise this time and gives the Bosnians the wherewithal to defend themselves.
<P>
<LI> A study published recently in the <I>American Journal of Public Health</I> suggests that racial discrimination by whites against blacks causes high blood pressure in blacks. Curiously, it was among blacks who were unaware that they had suffered discrimination that the effect was most pronounced. Dr. Nancy Krieger explained that this was a consequence of "suppressed or internalized response." The study did not address the effect that black-on-white crimewhich according to Irving Horowitz in the January 1995 issue of <I>Society</I> in 60 times greater than white-on-black crimehas on the health of whites.

Don't cry for Disney, <I>pace</I> the omnipresent editorial cartoons of a brave Mickey Mouse facing down a Chinese tank  la Tiananmen Square. Michael Eisner's decision to go ahead with Martin Scorsese's biopic about the Dalai Lama, over the objections of China, merely demonstrates that he knows what the real currency of Hollywood is. Disney may lose the opportunity to build an amusement park near Shanghai and the chance to show Disney films to a billion Chinese, but what all that lost money couldn't buy is prestige. For accidental culture reasons, Tibetans have cachet that other victims of Communismsay, Latvianslack. Had Disney scrapped Scorsese's film, Eisner & Co. would have had to face the wrath of Richard Gere and all the other pseudo-Buddhists in Shangri-la. Getting snubbed at a party is a wound that can't be healednot by all the tea in China.
<P>
 <LI>Brian Peterson and Amy Grossberg are the 18-year-old college freshmen who went to a motel in Delaware so that Amy could give birth to their child, then tossed him in a dumpster, where he was found, dead, the next day. The pair have been charged with first-degree murder, which could carry the death penalty. But why is what is they did so much more heinous than what a doctor might have done a few hours earlier, in a partial-birth abortion? The best line on this ugly affair belongs to George Will: "Could Delaware choose to execute the two by inserting scissors into the bases of their skulls, opening the scissors, inserting suction tubes and sucking out their brains? Of course not. The Constitution forbids choosing cruel and unusual punishments."

 a conservative Republican. The only reason I didn't vote for Barry Goldwater was because I was nine years old at the time. I am for medical marijuana because of my politics. But I'm also for it because I've had to use it.
<P>
As a political journalist, I mark the milestones of my life by election cycles. On the eve of Ronald Reagan's election I got married. On the eve of Bill Clinton's I got testicular cancer. The treatment was straightforwardoperation, followed by a rather harsh form of chemotherapy. Any chemotherapy is harsh, because all chemotherapy is poison. You're dumping poison into your bloodstream, killing millions of cells, in order to kill the thousands of malignant cells, which will not recover. Because it is poison, the body wants to get rid of it. That's why chemotherapy causes nausea. To deal with this, I took the latest anti-nausea drugs, including Zofran, and I also did self-hypnosis and mental imaging. These all worked to a point. But beyond that point, I needed extra help, and so I smoked marijuana.
<P>
I had smoked marijuana maybe ten times in college, during the Seventies. I even inhaled. I stopped because I found I didn't like smoke, or being high, or the conversation of pot-heads. I turned to it when I got cancer because marijuana gives healthy people an appetite, and prevents people who are nauseated from throwing up. None of my doctors or nurses at New York University Medical Center, or Memorial Sloan-Kettering, discouraged me from doing this. They had all had patients who had used marijuana to fight nausea, and who had reported good results. I had good results too. Because of the marijuana, my last two courses of chemotherapy were almost nausea-free.
<P>
There was only one problem-I had to become a criminal to do this.
<P>
Cancer patients are not the only people in this bind. AIDS patients who have the wasting syndrome report that marijuana gives them an appetite again. Glaucoma patients find that it arrests the deterioration of their eyes. People with chronic migraines, epilepsy, and multiple sclerosis use it to relieve their symptoms. A good summary of all these experiences can be found in <I>Marihuana: The Forbidden Medicine</I>, by Lester Grinspoon MD, and James B. Bakalar. Dr. Grinspoon is a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, and the book is published by Yale University Press, so this is not something downloaded from the Internet. But any sick person who wants to use marijuana to help himself has to break the law. I'm a member of the media elite, who lives in Manhattan, so I wasn't at high risk. But plenty of sick people get arrested, and plenty of them go to jail.
<P>
There are three common arguments against the medical use of marijuana, all of them faulty.
<P>
The first is that THC, the main active ingredient in the drug, is available in a legally prescribable pill form. But the pill has problems. It's expensive. Because it's a pill, and therefore slower acting, people have trouble adjusting the dosage; they often find themselves taking too much. It also seems to cause high levels of anxiety and depression. In my case, I thought treating nausea with a pill was not a bright idea.
<P>
The second argument is that smoked marijuana has never been tested scientifically. This is not entirely true. One test was done at UCLA in 1970 for the Los Angeles Police Department, which wanted to prove that pot smoking dilated the pupils. The researchers found that it contracted the pupils; they also discovered that marijuana relieved pressure within the eyeball. This is why marijuana is useful in treating glaucoma.
But it is true that it is difficult to test marijuana. That is because the government makes it so. The case of Dr. Donald Abrams at San Francisco General Hospital is instructive. Dr. Abrams is an AIDS researcher who wants to test the efficacy of smoked marijuana in treating the wasting syndrome. For more than two years, he tried to get marijuana legally from the National Institute on Drug Abuse for his experimentsto no avail. So doctors cannot prescribe marijuana because it hasn't been tested, but doctors aren't allowed to do any tests. This is a classic Catch-22.
<P>
The third objection is that by legalizing marijuana in one area, we will be setting a bad example to a society engaged in a war on drugs. In fact we will be setting no example at all. The availability of morphine in hospitals is not the reason people smoke crack. A hairless cancer patient with an IV tube in his arm is not a come-on for a pusher.
<P>
The connection between the issue of medical marijuana and the war on drugs runs the other way. The reason we don't allow medical use is because of the spill-over of an extreme war-time psychology. <I>National Review</I> has taken a stand on the war on drugs, but it is not relevant here. If you think the war is wrong, then the ban on medical marijuana is simply one symptom among many of its excess and folly. If you think the war is right, then the ban is an irrelevant and over-zealous off-shoot, like fighting the Kaiser in World War I by changing the German names of Midwestern streets.
<P>
I want to end by addressing my fellow Republicans. My support for medical marijuana is not a contradiction of my principles, but an extension of them. I am for law and order. But crime has to be fought intelligently, and the law disgraces itself when it harasses the sick. I am for traditional virtuesI support the Christian Coalition, and I supported the Moral Majority. But carrying your beliefs to unjust ends is not moral, it is philistine. Most important, I believe in getting government off people's backs. We should include the backs of sick people trying to help themselves.
<P>
My cancer is gone now; I was lucky. God forbid that anyone in this room should ever need chemotherapy. But statistics tell us that many of us will. Let me assure you that, whatever you think now, or however you vote, if that moment comes to you, you will turn to marijuana. Extend that liberty to your fellow citizens.

<font size=+3>I</font> <font size=+1>WOULD</font> have written this review sooner, but my computer broke down. I am not sure why it went dead, but since it did so just after I punched it, I would guess that there was some sort of connection. Why did I punch my computer? To punish it, of course. I had recently gotten on the Internet. After crawling -- not surfing -- along for about an hour and a half in search of some specific item of information, I had come just within reach of what I wanted when a stupid little screen display popped up and declared that Netscape, suffering from sensory overload, had had the cybernetic equivalent of a nervous breakdown. It was then that I punched my laptop.
<P>
In <I>Life on the Screen: Identity in the Age of the Internet</I>, Sherry Turkle presents us with a somewhat romanticized vision of the evolving interaction between computers and people. She notes that she has named her computer Miss Beautiful -- a sobriquet for her daughter -- and she tells of one of her students who named a computer program that organized her daily schedule after an  ex-boyfriend (``I love to see him do my menial tasks''). To me such personification is totally alien, even if I confess to feeling a little sorry for having acted aggressively against a machine that had served me irreproachably for the past year. Though I refuse to personify my computer, however, I do spatialize it. That is, as I peer into the blue, lacustrine depths of the Windows program, with its delightful frieze of parti-colored icons along the top, I feel as if I were floating in a post-modern swimming pool somewhere on Ischia or Capri. In other words, I feel at home in my computer and I am comfortable and happy there.
<P>
Still, that does not qualify me as a ``computer person,'' and I even take a little pride in not being one. This was one reason I had delayed for some time before subscribing to an Internet service. Another reason was that I failed to see what consequence this technology could possibly have for my life, why I really needed it. What finally convinced me to subscribe was the prospect of sending and receiving e-mail, not to mention a commercial in which Barry Farber seemed to suggest, if I understood him correctly, that I would essentially be able to launch intercontinental ballistic missiles from the intimacy of my bedroom.
<P>
I was soon undeceived. The first thing one notices about the Internet is that it has been vastly overrated. Though you will have heard of the Information Super-Highway, what awaits you is rather a high-tech single-lane dirt road where an excess of traffic has brought transportation almost to a standstill. Though you will also have heard about ``surfing'' the Internet, the gliding swiftness implied by that word will mean little to those who seem rather to limp or stumble than to surf. And to the extent that the surfing analogy has any validity, it is only in the sense that any moment a big wave -- as in more data than your fragile modem can handle -- will overwhelm the whole contraption.
<P>
The second thing one notices is that the Internet is the subtlest thief of time. By making you wait for each parcel of data you want, it steals a minute here and four minutes there until, before you know it, two hours of your life are gone beyond recall. And during this period of waiting, because these deposits of time are so tiny, you are unable to engage in any other activity. Add to this the fact that, once you arrive at the site, you are apt to find a poorly written document whose loopy, time-consuming graphics are as appealing as public-access cable television in all its ranting, unedited profusion. There are many polished web sites, but most of these turn out to be little more than advertisements for providers of commercial goods and services, or they are documents provided by non-profit organizations. The idea that one can surf through the shelves of the public library may one day become a reality, but we are very far from that now.
<P>
The Internet works in two ways. By typing in a web address, you can go directly to a specific site that has information that you know you want. But to surf the Internet is different. This suggests going along for the ride and not quite knowing where you are going. You do this by typing in the name of the subject or person you want to research. A moment later, the search mechanism, in my case Netscape, applies its various inscrutable criteria to come up with the nearest matches to what you seek. Naturally I began by typing in my name to see how many people on the Internet had mentioned -- dare I hope it -- my articles or my book. Here I ran into one of the most common problems with the Internet. The searcher cannot give you the object itself, but only matches of greater or lesser probability and a synopsis of each site. Thus when I entered the name James Gardner, it told me that it had found 86,754 Jameses and 23,456 Gardners and then proceeded to give examples in which the two words occurred in the requisite proximity. Unfortunately my name is not an uncommon one, and so I had to get through several entomologists and chiropractors, two naval engineers and a masseur before finding any reference to myself.
<P>
For some time I continued in this way to putter around on the information dirt road, accomplishing little and gradually coming to understand that the Internet, for all that people have said about it, is a more or less total waste of time and a not inconsiderable waste of money.
<P>
<font size=+3>A</font><font size=+1>ND</font> it was at precisely that moment that something happened which caused me suddenly to appreciate what everyone has been talking about for the last two or three years. What I understood was that the Internet can be viewed as a massive encyclopedia. But whereas all earlier encyclopedias, simply by virtue of their existing as physical objects, were in a sense dead and out of date as a precondition of their very existence, the Internet by contrast is the Encyclopedia of NOW. As it happens I am finishing up a book on fringe groups, a subject which the Internet is uniquely qualified to tackle. I found at my fingertips abundant information about flat-earthers, Andrea Dworkin, snuff films, Queer Nation, the John Birch Society, creationism, and Islamic Jihad.
<P>
Another thing the Internet teaches you is that, no matter how obscure your interests, there are other people out there in cyberspace who are as passionate about them as you are. Though I know very few people whose interest in Latin is as energetic as my own, I soon found that I could correspond in that language with a group of college men in the Netherlands as well as an old professor in Finland and someone else in South Africa. What I find important and emblematic about this fact is that the futuristic Internet can be an agent by which the past is preserved and reinvigorated.
<P>
When I understood that, I confess that I had something of a conversion regarding not only the Internet, but also the great information revolution which is said to be getting under way. As of this moment mankind is entranced by the possibilities of computing. The almost obsessive insistence with which people seem to talk of nothing else, with which the Internet haunts our business pages, publishers' catalogues, and the graphics of advertisers and television producers, suggests that something almost incalculably big is afoot. To some degree this fascination resembles the interest in the atom 50 years ago and in space exploration 25 years ago. But neither of these technologies ever really promised, and surely neither ever produced, a direct and material effect upon our daily lives. With the Internet, by contrast, there is a nervous, giddy sense that, at long last, we are approaching some kind of critical mass. There is a buzz running so loud through all the breadth of human society, an electric excitement so jolting and so unexpected, that one could be excused for thinking that we are on the verge of some great new age. And though books, if we believe the prophets of doom, are soon to vanish from the earth, there is nothing publishers seem to find more attractive or salable than volumes that promote and explain this instrument of their allegedly imminent demise.
<P>
The <I>People</I> magazine approach to the information revolution can be found in <I>Road Warriors</I>, by Daniel Burstein and David Kline. For these two investigative journalists, despite a useful introduction that reveals their deep understanding of what is at stake, the information revolution is essentially a re-enactment of earlier heroic ages of capitalist free-enterprise. But instead of the Fisks and the Goulds, we have shakers and movers ranging from John Malone and Ray Smith to Viacom, Sprint, and the Federal Communications Commission. Nevertheless, the authors are too hard-headed and rationalistic to be taken in by the euphoria of the revolution at hand, or to allow that enthusiasm to affect the tenor of their reportage.
<P>
Far different is <I>The Road Ahead</I>, by Bill Gates, the prophet, if not the Messiah, of the information movement. His book can be read, if one is cynically inclined, as an extended sales pitch for Bill Gates. But Mr. Gates, despite his open and irrepressible enthusiasm for computing, has written a surprisingly candid and useful book. For Gates, the future of computing is the future of mankind, with technology becoming ever cheaper, more powerful, and more pervasive. As he expresses it in his chirping way:
<P>
<blockquote>
I've already said I'm an optimist, and I'm optimistic about the impact of the new technology. It will enhance leisure time and enrich culture by expanding the distribution of information. It will help relieve pressures on urban areas by enabling individuals to work from home or remote-site offices. It will relieve pressure on natural resources because increasing numbers of products will be able to take the form of bits rather than of manufactured goods.</blockquote>
<P>
What makes <I>The Road Ahead</I> so surprisingly useful is that it seems to be a fair, even-handed, and sober appraisal of the situation and very clearly explains complicated ideas to laymen like myself. The author simply lays out one concept after another -- the Internet, the information super-highway, high-definition television, and fiber optics -- with the result that those of us who are not techies finally understand all the terms that have been buzzing around in our heads for the past five years.
<P>
Naturally the information revolution is not without its dissenters. Few are as dourly pessimistic as Mark Slouka in <I>War of the Worlds</I>. This book seems to me to overreach somewhat by buying into the whole virtual-reality racket -- which I predict will remain decidedly ancillary to the information revolution  -- and by supposing that this and other developments will spell the end of reality as we know it. As for the Internet itself, it ``combines the worst of television -- its addictiveness, its passivity -- with the worst of on-line communication -- its self-conscious glorification of superfice [<I>sic</I>], its pop-culture chattiness, its pointless immediacy.''
<P>
Mark Dery's <I>Escape Velocity</I> in one sense goes even further. Dery seems at once to mock and to believe recent ``post-human'' speculations that advocate or predict a literal, physical merging of man and machine into a digitized, dehumanized whole. His book is a highly detailed discussion of cyberculture: that is, those new forms of art, literature, music, and attitude that have arisen at the corners of the information revolution. In his pages we encounter all the technopagans, virtual anarchists, cyber-novelists, performance artists, and cult film-makers for whom the information revolution is a virtual Bohemia joined in cyberspace to an equally virtual, if dystopian, Wild West.
<P>
<font size=+3>T</font><font size=+1>HE</font> fixation on the future that all these books exhibit to a remarkable degree has been a fixture of Western discourse for the last two hundred years: starting with Restif de la Bretonne, and extending through Jules Verne, H. G. Wells, Arthur C. Clarke, and William Gibson. The problem with books that seek, as these do, to discuss the future is that the future really is an undiscovered country from which imaginary travelers come back bearing more outlandish tales than Sir John Mandeville with his one-eyed anthropophagi. And because anyone's guess is as good as anyone else's, there seems to be an overwhelming impulse to exaggerate in the most shameless fashion imaginable, since it is the <I>deformation professionnelle</I> of all writers to want at all costs to have something to say.
<P>
And yet futurologists, even when they are more circumspect in their predictions, always make the same fundamental mistake, whether they view the future as a light-filled, pyramid-powered Eden or as a cybernetic Hell. Indeed, it is precisely the same mistake that many historians make when writing about the remoter past. And this mistake, it seems to me, is to suppose that to change the material circumstances of life is to alter fundamentally the sense of life itself. But life as it is lived is always pretty much the same, with the same protocols of boredom and excitement, the same glare of midday and gloom of eventide, the same petty ambitions, existential doubts, and immortal longings. We can certainly create the circumstances of greater freedom or greater oppression, but the range of possible variation in life itself, in the simple, irreducible sense of being alive, is far narrower than our chattering classes usually appreciate.
<P>
At the same time, it would be foolhardy and unfair to reason from this that change never happens. We have undergone great changes in this century; and though the Internet is still in its earliest infancy, it promises to grow up quickly. From a purely technological perspective, many users of the Internet already have far more efficient modems than I have. And through Moore's Law, which states that every 18 months computers double in power as their prices drop by half, we can expect that we all shall soon be getting better Internet service for less money, which means that fewer users will feel the need to punch their laptops.
<P>
Earlier in my life, as a callow adolescent, I was so disenchanted with the paltriness of industrial civilization -- this was in the late Seventies -- that I almost felt, foolish as it sounds, that I'd like to repeal the modern age entirely. As each day passes, however, I find myself strengthened in the hope that, with the arrival at long last of the information revolution, human society will become more enlightened, more various, more efficient, cleaner, less expensive, freer, and more fun than it has ever been before. One feels privileged to be alive and conscious at this moment in history and can hardly wait to see what humankind will come up with next.

<H2>Mr. Dole's Fate.</H2>
</center> 
<P>
<center>By John O'Sullivan</center>
<P>
<center><I>Mr. O'Sullivan is the editor of</I> National Review.</center>
<P>
<center>
<B><I>This article originally appeared in the London</I> New Statesman, <I>August 9, 1996</I></B></center> 
<P>
If one had to predict the eventual verdict on the Republicans gathering in Convention at San Diego next week, it would be suicide by timidity. The GOPa conservative party in a conservative country at a conservative historical momentis facing a major defeat in November at the hands of the most distrusted President since Richard Nixon. It has reached these straits not by embracing a Pat Buchanan or a radical right agenda but by allowing the party establishment to impose a decent but ideologically flavorless moderate, apparently out-of-touch with both party and country, as its standard-bearer. And it proposes to celebrate this event, fittingly enough, by staging a Convention from which all debate, controversy and indeed politics will have been ruthlessly expunged to make room for short pep-talks, video cartoons, advertising films, and cameo appearances by political celebrities (who are, by definition, not very celebrated).
<P>
The manufactured enthusiasm in the hall, however, will be balanced by the sincere defeatism outside it. Even Republican politicians and pundits sympathetic to the GOP believe that Dole is as good as defeated already. The only question to be decided is whether he will take the Republicans in House and Senate down with him. Some even speculate that the Republican party itself is heading for a post-election crack-up in which economic conservatives ("moderates" in NewClassSpeak) will finally split from the Religious Right. After which, in the approved media version, Buchananite "America Firsters," Perotistas, supply-siders, right-to-lifers, and all the other inmates of the Right Zoo will battle endlessly to succeed the GOP , allowing liberal Democrats to regain their rightful place as the government of the country. Liberaldom, in ruins only last year, will have been restored.
<P>
If this vision seems at all plausible, it is a sour tribute to the extent of the GOP's collapse since 1994. The problem is generally assumed to be Dole the campaigner. Michael Kelly of the New Yorker brilliantly pinned him down as a "nega-candidate" who campaigns in an almost post-modern style, reciting his texts as instructed by consultants but then subverting their message with ironic ad-libs. Of his own campaign slogan, he remarked vaguely (and inaccurately) in one interview: "A Better Plan, a man for a better Americawhatever that slogan is they're working on." But Mr. Kelly points out what others have missed: there is something attractive about this unwillingness to play by the rules of a stage-managed media game. Such an assertion of integrity, subtle but unmistakable, against the cynical tactics of modern campaigning (which Clinton has embraced in the person of super-consultant Dick Morris), might even be the only way Mr. Dole could win in November.
<P>
What is killing him is his carefully-thought-out and well-executed political strategy. He has been following Richard Nixon's advice that the way to win the White House is by veering rightwards in the primaries and centerwards in the general election. This leftright analysis was always better-suited to Europe than America, but it made some sense when Big Labor confronted Big Capital across a fledgling middle class, when most Americans lived either in cities or in rural areas, when lunch-pail issues dominated both people's lives and political debate, and when there were no culture wars or fears of Balkanization because almost everyone agreed on the virtues and opportunities that together constitute the American dream. It has been rendered virtually useless by the growth of suburban America (now home to half the electorate), the rise of the Sunbelt (51 per cent of the electoral college vote), the continuing decline of labor unions (representing only 15 per cent of the workforce), the growing importance of small business, entrepreneurship and highly skilled labor (over 60 per cent of the workforce is now classified as professional or white-collar), the emergence of single-issue politics from feminism to abortion (which has helped drive blue-collar Democrats into the GOP), the demographic transformation of America by immigration from a bi-racial nation to a multi-ethnic one (in which non-Hispanic whites are projected to be a minority by 2051), and the social fragmentation and cultural anxieties these trends have fostered. 
<P>
Where once two great political blocs fought over the small strip of middle ground separating them, today political parties have to assemble a majority anew in each election from among a scattering of regional, ethnic and social groups. Psephologist Patrick Reddy has identified seven such "tribes": Blacks, new minorities (Asians and Hispanics), white liberals, working-class or populist whites, Northern rural voters, suburbanites, and conservatives. The first three groups are in the Democrats' pocket; the last three lean to the GOP; and working-class whites in recent years have been moving sharply to the Right. But all of these groups need to be won over, or at least energized, by the powerful political appeals every four years. 
<P>
So far Bill Clinton has been wooing them far more effectively than the GOP. He shored up his Democratic base among minorities and liberals by portraying Republican cuts in projected Medicare spending (which he was also proposing, though to a lesser extent) as root-and-branch attacks on social entitlements. He simultaneously made inroads into the suburbanite vote by accepting a balanced budgetwittily balanced by spending cuts that would come into effect after the end of his second term. And he appealed to both suburbanites and populist whites by rhetorical and symbolic conservatism such as his call for school uniforms and teenage curfews. Shameless though they are, such tactics would certainly have blunted a GOP attackif one had been launched.
<P>
But Bob Dole, in addition to diving towards a mythical center, has been almost entirely reactive, concentrating on issues like abortion or problems like the "gender gap" where his party is divided or the Republicans are less trusted . To grasp the effect, imagine that John Major had spent 1992 talking about the NHS and never mentioning taxes. 
<P>
In fact, as Clinton's tactics reveal, new demographics mean new issues. Most Americans (about four and a half of Mr. Reddy's seven tribes) are prosperous and believe that government is too big and too intrusive. They don't want to see middle-class entitlements eradicated, but they look at the budget and sense that they will have to be at least pruned. And anyway, with the combination of federal, state and local taxes at 31.5 per cent of GDPlow by international standards but a peacetime high in the U.S.they feel the tax bite of government more. Here, at least, the Republicans have crafted a positive appeal to their constituencies. Dole's promise of a tax cut earlier this week serves as a proxy for all of these issues. The voters may not believe that as President he would actually cut taxes by $600 billion, but they will take his pledge as a sign that he will not raise them, that he may even cut them by some amount, and that therefore he will be forced to rein government back. 
<P>
The pressing political reality of 1996, however, is that for all the talk about "downsizing" and "economic anxiety", it is the issues of moral decline, social disorder and ethnic separatism that people are really worried about. As Michael Barone pointed out in <I>The American Enterprise</I>: "Violent crime is a greater threat to most Americans than short-term unemployment. Divorce is a far greater threat than job loss to the typical person's lifetime project of accumulating wealth . . ." Immigration, racial quotas, and multiculturalism arouse similar fears, and they have the added annoyance that, unlike crime, they are the deliberate effects of government policy. But the language in which people would once have expressed such anxieties has been discredited as "racist" or "nativist" and so they complain about them in the code of "economic anxiety."
<P>
Clinton, who allegedly blames his 1980 gubernatorial defeat on voter anger at the Mariel boatlift of Cuban immigrants, has been quick to sense the importance of these issues. His symbolic conservative gestures, the administration's theatrical "crackdown" on illegal border crossing, and the crime bill, itself largely symbolic, have defused some of them. But his signing of the welfare reform bill was as far as he could go in this direction without enraging his political base among liberals, blacks, and new minorities. Dole's obvious tactic therefore is emphasize those issues where the President simply cannot endorse conservative policies. A random sample might include: restricting the powers of the federal judiciary; extending school choice, via vouchers, to parochial schools; ending race and gender preferences; seriously enforcing laws against illegal immigration but also reducing legal immigration; supporting English as the official language and, more generally, opposing the wen of multiculturalism; and in general defending the concept of an inclusive "American" identity against the second coming of hyphenation. 
<P>
Most of these issues fall into neither of the two approved conservative categories: the "social conservatism" of the religious right and the libertarianism of the economic right. But what might best be called "cultural conservatism" gets support varying from 65 to 80 per cent in opinion polls. It arouses all three of the GOP tribes, plus the swing vote of populist whites, <I>and</I> Black Americans who face competition in the labor market from low-paid immigrants. In particular, it appeals to natural Republicans disaffected from the post-Reagan GOPsecularized Protestants, Northern WASPs, environmentalists, the Planned Parenthood crowd, and above all supporters of the Reform Party. A good example is Ross Perot's challenger, former Governor Dick Lamm, who is the author of tract entitled "The Immigration Time Bomb."
<P>
The GOP has dabbled in these waters with extreme nervousness. What restrains it is mainly that its post-civil-rights leadership is afraid of being seen as "racist" or "nativist" and "on the wrong side of history." This nervousness is rational. <I>The New York Times</I>, which noted in a single detached comment on a Democratic political ad that it was "unusual" for Democrats to use "inflammatory negative images of illegal immigrants," would still be shrieking "Willie Horton" if the GOP had done anything similar. There is also an ideological element in Republican reluctance. Leading Republicans like Jack Kemp and House Leader Dick Armey are uncomfortable with non-economic "hot button" issues like quotas, and intellectually committed to the view that immigration is an unqualified economic benefit. But they are resisting the majority of their party here. And it is a fair bet that, in any post-election struggle but especially one after a Dole defeat, the Republicans will move to add cultural conservatism to the religious and economic varieties. The signs are already there in Republican fund-raising letters which highlight quotas and immigration. 
<P>
But that will be too late for Mr. Dole. If he remains committed to a campaign of blandness and Nixon's advice, he will repeat his recent experience with two issues which have eighty per cent popular backing in virtually every poll but until recently a low political salience: increasing the minimum wage and making English the official language. Dole doubtless believed, following the conventional media wisdom, that the first is centrist, and the second "right," even "extreme." At any rate, hardly anything has been heard from him on official English since the primaries (indeed, he has been visibly edging away from the similar issue of racial and gender quotas). But he did not take long to move to the center to endorse a higher minimum wage once the Democrats had raised the issue. The net effect was to deny himself a popular issue with a powerful appeal both to his natural constituencies and to working-class whites, while helping to concentrate people's attention on the minimum wage where the Democrats enjoy a natural advantage with the public.
<P>
And this on the say-so of the late Richard Nixon. It is hard to believe that the Nixon of 1968, who crafted the new Republican majority with the southern strategy and appeals to law 'n' order, would have followed his own advice so blindly. 
<P>

Backgrounder No. 1083 -- Appendix<br>
May 16, 1996<br>

<h2>APPENDIX</h2>

<b>Sample Resolution for Closing the Emerging 
Gap Between U.S. Military Forces and Overseas Security Commitments
<p>
H. Con. Res. 1</b>
</center><p>
Expressing the sense of Congress concerning the overseas security commitments and the national security of the United States.
<p><center><b>
IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
May 15, 1996</b></center>
<p>
Mr. X submitted the following concurrent resolution, which was referred to the Committee on National Security
<p><hr><p>
<center><b>CONCURRENT RESOLUTION</b></center>
<p>
Expressing the sense of Congress concerning the overseas security commitments and national security of the United States.
<p>
Whereas the United States currently maintains a wide variety of security commitments to its friends and allies around the world, including countries in Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East;
<p>
Whereas the Clinton Administration in 1993 proposed in its "Bottom-Up Review" of defense policy to uphold the existing security commitments of the United States by fielding conventional military forces capable of fighting and winning two major regional conflicts, each roughly similar in size and scope to the Persian Gulf War, "nearly simultaneously;"
<p>
Whereas the Bottom-Up Review recommends the retention of ten active divisions in the Army, twenty tactical fighter wings in the Air Force, 11 active aircraft carriers in the Navy, and 174,000 active duty troops in the Marine Corps;
<p>
Whereas the Bottom-Up Review recommends the retention of a military manpower endstrength of 2,366,000 positions in the active and reserve components combined;
<p>
Whereas four retired military officers reported to Senator John McCain in February 1995, that the conventional forces recommended by the Bottom-Up Review, even if fully funded, are not capable of meeting the assigned mission of addressing two major regional conflicts in short succession;
<p>
Whereas there is widespread agreement among defense analysts outside the Clinton Administration, including those with the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the Congressional Budget Office, the Defense Budget Project (now the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments), the General Accounting Office, and The Heritage Foundation, that the Clinton Administration's defense budget is too small to pay for the force recommended by the Bottom-Up Review;
<p>
Whereas the Clinton Administration's six-year (fiscal years 1997-2002) defense funding shortfall relative to the force recommended by the Bottom-Up Review likely exceeds $100 billion;
<p>
Whereas the Clinton Administration's defense funding shortfall, assuming the needs for readiness and modernization are properly addressed and strategic and nuclear forces are funded at necessary levels, will likely force the reduction of conventional forces to levels of no more than eight active Army divisions, 15 Air Force tactical fighter wings, eight active aircraft carriers, and 140,000 active duty Marine Corps troops;
<p>
Whereas the Clinton Administration's defense funding shortfall is likely to drive the military manpower endstrength down to a level of just over 2,000,000 positions in the active and reserve components combined;
<p>
Whereas seven active divisions from the Army, twenty tactical fighter wings from the Air Force, six aircraft carrier battle groups from the Navy, and 93,000 troops from the Marine Corps either participated in or contributed to the force fielded during the Persian Gulf War;
<p>
Whereas the conventional forces likely resulting from the levels of defense spending proposed by the Clinton Administration during the next six years would make it difficult to field an expeditionary force of the size that fought the Persian Gulf War, much less the two such conflicts envisioned by the Bottom-Up Review; and
<p>
Whereas the 1995 congressional budget resolution (House Concurrent Resolution 67) directs a total level of expenditures for defense for the six-year period covering fiscal years 1997-2002 that is roughly similar to that proposed by the Clinton Administration: Now therefore be it
<p><blockquote>
<I>Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring</I>), That it is the sense of Congress that -- 
<p><blockquote>
(1) the protection of the vital interests of the United States requires that the United States uphold its existing security commitments, including those to friendly and allied countries in Asia, Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East;
<p>
(2) the conventional forces of the United States should be large and strong enough to uphold the existing overseas security commitments of the United States;
<p>
(3) the smaller conventional forces likely resulting from the defense budget proposed by the Clinton Administration will be too small to fulfill the existing overseas security commitments of the United States;
<p>
(4) the existing overseas security commitments of the United States can be met by fielding conventional forces capable of fighting and winning one major regional conflict, roughly the size of the Persian Gulf War, and one minor regional conflict, roughly the size of the 1989 invasion of Panama, simultaneously, as opposed to the two major regional conflicts called for by the Bottom-Up Review;
<p>
(5) fulfilling the existing overseas security commitments of the United States requires the United States to contribute military forces to peacekeeping missions only when doing so will serve to protect the vital interests of the United States;
<p>
(6) fulfilling the existing overseas security commitments of the United States can be met with conventional military forces roughly of the size proposed by the Bottom-Up Review, which include the equivalent of 15 total divisions in the Army (10 active divisions), twenty tactical fighter wings in the Air Force, 11 aircraft carrier battle groups (active) in the Navy; and 174,000 active duty troops in the Marine Corps, provided these forces are both combat ready and fully modernized;
<p>
(7) fulfilling the existing overseas security commitments of the United States can be achieved with a total military manpower endstrength similar to that proposed by the Bottom-Up Review, some 2,366,000 positions in the active and reserve components combined;
<p>
(8)  Congress should provide the funds required for the forces recommended by this resolution, even though they will likely be substantially more than what the Clinton Administration has budgeted for defense over the next six years. </blockquote></blockquote>

<title>WHY DO SO FEW UNMARRIED PREGNANT WOMEN MAKE ADOPTION PLANS?</title>

<h2>WHY DO SO FEW UNMARRIED<br>
PREGNANT WOMEN MAKE<br>
ADOPTION PLANS?</h2>

<p>

A glaring discrepancy exists between what Americans believe and
how they behave regarding adoption as a positive response to crisis
pregnancies. Consider the following data:

<p>

<li>Many Americans believe that adoption is the best response
to an out-of-wedlock pregnancy. A 1995 Family Research Council
survey of 1,000 Americans found that, when presented with four
options to resolve out-of-wedlock teenage pregnancies, 29 percent
of respondents thought it best to &quot;have the child and put
it up for adoption;&quot; 24 percent thought it best for the mother
&quot;to marry the child's father and have the child;&quot; 11
percent thought it best for the mother &quot;to have the child
and raise it by herself;&quot; and only 8 percent thought it best
for her to have an abortion.[1]

<p>

However, in reality, 46 percent of all the nonmarital pregnancies
in 1991 ended in induced abortion, 10 percent ended in miscarriage,
and 44 percent were carried to term, of which only 2 percent were
placed for adoption.[2] (It is not known whether the mother eventually
married the child's father or chose to raise the child by herself
in the remaining 98 percent of &quot;live birth&quot; cases.)

<p>

<li>Many young, unmarried pregnant women also hold favorable attitudes
toward those who choose adoption. A survey of such women staying
in maternity homes found that the majority, regardless of whether
they were choosing adoption or single parenthood, hold positive
attitudes toward mothers who place their children for adoption.
The respondents believe that a woman who places her baby for adoption
loves the baby, wants the best for the baby, is being a good parent
in a special way, is being responsible, and is neither selfish
nor abandoning the baby.[3] Nevertheless, many of these same unmarried
pregnant women had never considered adoption as an option for
their children.

<p>

Why do so few unmarried women choose adoption in reality when
both they and the general American public hold favorable attitudes
toward adoption? Also, what accounts for the decline of adoptions 
over time? Before 1973, about one in five non-marital births to white 
women was placed for adoption. By the late 1970s, this proportion had 
shrunk to less than one in 10, and by the late 1980s, to one in 30.[4]

<p>

The answer may lie less in the fact that public opinion towards
adoption has changed than in the fact that other options have
overshadowed adoption, making adoption less visible as an alternative.

<p>

The impact of three major social trends during the last two to
three decades may provide some clues to this phenomenon:

<p>

(1) <b>Increasing Social Acceptance of Single Parenthood</b> --
The sheer prevalence of single-parent families has increased the
social acceptability of single motherhood. For example, in 1970,
13 percent of all families with children were single-parent families.
By 1994, more than 30 percent of all families with children were
headed by a single parent.[5]

<p>

The trend towards single parenthood began with the liberalizing
of divorce laws in the late 1960s and early 1970s and the subsequent
divorce epidemic. Indeed, the number of divorces per year tripled
between 1960 and 1990.[6] But when divorce began to level off in
the 1980s, the growth in illegitimacy continued the trend. In
1970, 11 percent of all births were to unmarried women; in 1980,
18 percent of all births were nonmarital; and by 1991, an astounding
30 percent of all births were out-of-wedlock.[7] Yet, even more significant
than the rise in nonmarital births is the even faster growth in
the <I>visibility</I> of illegitimacy. Adoption helps to mask
the visibility of illegitimacy because the child born out-of-wedlock
is immediately placed in a two-parent home. However, the proportion
of unmarried women choosing adoption dramatically declined during
the same time period that illegitimacy rates rose.

<p>

It is this high visibility of single-parent families that has
made single parenting normative in today's society. Thus, there
is more precedent for young unmarried women to choose single parenthood
and comparatively less incentive for them to place their children
in adoptive homes.

<p>

(2) <b>The Legalization of Abortion</b> -- The introduction of
abortion has greatly diminished the likelihood of choosing adoption
because it has altered the thought processes by which both the
pregnant woman and her counselors approach an unintended pregnancy.

<p>

Before abortion was legalized, women facing a crisis pregnancy
had only to decide among three or four options: adoption, marrying
the father, raising the child herself and/or having her parent
raise the child. Among these options, adoption fared relatively
well as one in five white women chose adoption.

<p>

However, after abortion was legalized, a two-tiered thought process
replaced the previously one-tiered process. The preeminent question
was no longer &quot;Who shall raise this child?&quot; but rather,
&quot;Shall I have this child?&quot; And with that change in question
also came a change in focus from being child-centered to woman-centered.
Thus, it is not surprising that fewer women are choosing adoption
because adoption typically requires a child-centered focus.

<p>

Since the legalization of abortion, pregnancy counselors must
also spend much more time and effort addressing the first question
of &quot;Shall this pregnancy be carried to term or aborted?&quot;
And while this must be the first question addressed, too often
counselors give short shrift to the second question of &quot;Who
shall raise this child?&quot; One study found that nearly 40 percent
of pregnancy counselors failed to include adoption as an option
in their counseling. Even worse, the counselors had a 40 percent
rate of uncertainty and inaccurate knowledge about adoption. Some
even failed to present adoption as an option because they thought
the girls would not want to hear about it.[8]

<p>

(3) <b>Increasing Availability and Use of Welfare Benefits</b>
-- To the degree financial considerations play a role in whether
a woman chooses to marry, place for adoption, or raise the child
herself, the increasing availability and use of welfare benefits
add weight to the single-parenting option. Beginning in the late
1960s, Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and Medicaid
benefits for pregnant, single mothers became well-established
and well-used. Both AFDC and Medicaid have grown tremendously
over the last two decades as more and more unwed mothers have
chosen single parenthood. Knowing that they have this &quot;safety
net&quot; on which to fall back, many unmarried women choose to
raise their infants rather than make adoption plans.

<p>

In conclusion, despite the fact that most Americans favorably
view adoption, several major social trends have altered the course
of the discussion and made the adoption option less visible. However,
there is a growing counter-movement to change the terms of discourse
once again and combat the social trends that lead not only to
fewer adoptions, but also to greater numbers of out-of-wedlock
births, abortions, and welfare recipients. During the mid-1980s,
a &quot;new wave&quot; of adoption and maternity services agencies
began opening up in the United States. These include more private
adoption agencies, pro-life crisis pregnancy centers, maternity
homes, and private charitable organizations. The degree to which
these institutions grow more visible and flourish is the degree
to which adoption can grow, narrowing the gap between public opinion
and reality.

<title>MILITARY HOMOSEXUAL CASES RACE TO THE SUPREME COURT</title>

<h2>MILITARY HOMOSEXUAL CASES<br>
RACE TO THE SUPREME COURT</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Lieutenant Colonel Robert L. Maginnis (U.S.A., Ret.)</i></center>

<p>

Two military homosexual cases are now competing for a Supreme
Court hearing. Both cases have already been heard at the appellate
court level, and decisions are expected by the summer.

<p>

These cases are complicated by major differences between the congressional
law concerning homosexuality in the armed forces (Defense Authorization
Act of 1994, 10 U.S.C. &#167; 654) and the regulations issued
by the Clinton administration to implement this law (DoD Directive
1332.14 and 1332.30).[1]

<p>

These differences include:

<p><ul>

<li>As passed by Congress, the law forbids service by homosexuals.
The Clinton regulations permit service by &quot;celibate&quot;
homosexuals and drop the principled and unambiguous statement
that &quot;homosexuality is incompatible with military service.&quot;

<p>

<li>The law requires the discharge of people with a propensity
to engage in homosexual conduct. The Clinton regulations redefine
propensity to mean the narrow term &quot;likelihood.&quot;

<p>

The law relies on commander discretion to initiate investigations.
The Clinton regulations create a &quot;criminal-like&quot; standard
before investigations can be initiated. According to Secretary
of Defense William Perry, attending gay pride parades, frequenting
gay bars, and possessing gay materials are not &quot;credible&quot;
evidence to initiate an investigation. In addition, the Clinton
regulations hinder military criminal investigators from investigating
private consensual sexual misconduct (sodomy and adultery).

<p>

<li>The law forbids homosexual service for readiness reasons.
But contrary to 200 years of military practice, Clinton's Defense
Department no longer considers homosexual behavior a marker for
increased security risk. Information discovered during a security
investigation cannot be used for adverse action without permission
from high-level political appointees.

</ul><p>

<center><h3><i>ABEL ET AL. V. U.S.A.</i></h3></center>

<p>

The Family Research Council filed a friend-of-the-court brief
in the first federal challenge to the military's homosexual policy.[2]
The case involves six avowed homosexuals who allege that the military's
policy violates their First and Fifth Amendment rights.

<p>

This case was filed in 1994 shortly after the congressional law
took effect. The plaintiffs skirted the military's normal administrative
process and went straight to federal court seeking a preliminary
injunction (PI) barring the military from discharging them until
their constitutional challenge was resolved. The government sought
relief from the PI via the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2d Circuit,
and was granted that motion, forcing the lower court to hurry
up the hearing.

<p>

In March, 1995, <I>Abel et al. v. U.S.A.</I> was heard by Judge
Eugene Nickerson of the Eastern District of New York. Lambda Legal
Defense and Education Fund and the American Civil Liberties Union
represented the homosexual service members. They called six 
&quot;expert&quot; witnesses to refute the military's claim of a 
constitutional right to exclude homosexuals. Curiously, Clinton Justice 
Department lawyers did not counter any of these witnesses with expert 
testimony from defenders of the ban.

<p>

In addition, the Justice Department failed to:[3]

<p><ul>

<li>Present well-documented arguments for denying homosexual service
based on physical and psychological problems.

<p>

<li>Demonstrate that the policy is conduct-based rather than status-based
as the plaintiffs argued.

<p>

<li>Show that homosexual &quot;lifestyles&quot; and &quot;values&quot;
are contrary to the best interests of the armed services and present
serious morale and unit cohesion problems.

<p>

<li>Refute a flawed study cited by the plaintiffs as evidence
that homosexuals will not damage morale and unit cohesion.

<p>

<li>Demonstrate that homosexuals present a risk to the military.

</ul><p>

The plaintiffs complain that the government violated their First
Amendment rights when it tried to discharge them based on their
homosexuality. The government argued that this is not a First
Amendment issue because the law and the policy are directed solely
at the prohibition of acts and give members the opportunity to
rebut the presumption of misconduct. However, the government failed
to show a nexus between a declaration of homosexuality and homosexual
misconduct. In fact, government lawyers labeled much of the available
evidence as &quot;myths,&quot; thus aiding the plaintiffs.

<p>

The government argued that heterosexual service members &quot;will
be upset by a co-worker's mere statement of homosexuality&quot;
and as a result refuse to work cooperatively. Judge Nickerson
found for the plaintiffs.[4] He labeled the discrimination unjustified
and noted key differences between the congressional law and the
Clinton policy:

<p><ul>

<li>Although the law permits asking about homosexual acts and
orientation at the point of admission, the Clinton administration
has rejected such questions. The judge labeled this as unusual.
On one hand the Pentagon encourages homosexuals to join (by not
making homosexuality part of a pre-induction litmus test) and
then insists that the homosexual remain secretive about his 
&quot;status.&quot;

<p>

<li>The law denies service to homosexuals, but the policy permits
service to admitted homosexuals who can rebut the presumption
that they will engage in homosexual misconduct. This creates a
status/conduct dichotomy. The judge labels the rebuttable presumption
as &quot;Orwellian&quot; because the government failed to show
a connection between a declaration of homosexuality and misconduct.
The judge understandably concluded &quot;that the admission of
homosexuals did not pose an uncontrollable risk that they would
commit acts inherently dangerous to morale, good order, and 
discipline....&quot;

</ul><p>

Nickerson explained that his task &quot;is to determine the constitutionality
of the policy [read law] adopted by Congress, not its morality.&quot;
He argues that everyone is &quot;entitled to think it demeaning
and unworthy of a great nation to base a policy [read law] on
pretense rather than on truth.&quot;

<p>

Nickerson's decision was appealed by the government to the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan. The hearing
was set for December 19 but was postponed due to unusual circumstances.

<p>

The night before the hearing, a letter was faxed to one of the
judges from the Justice Department. It reminded Judge Guido Calabresi
that back in March 1993 he had signed a letter to Congress maintaining
that legislation banning homosexuals from the military was unconstitutional.
At the time he co-signed the letter with 118 other lawyers, Judge
Calabresi was the dean of the Yale Law School. He was appointed
by President Clinton to the federal bench in 1994.

<p>

Calabresi's letter says, &quot;The ban on military service by
lesbian, gay and bisexual Americans violates the most basic premise
of equal protection law: that all similarly situated persons should
be treated alike.&quot;[5]

<p>

The judge recused himself from the case the morning of the scheduled
hearing. The case was rescheduled with a new panel and heard on
January 16, 1996.

<p>

At that hearing, Chief Judge John M. Walker Jr., a Bush appointee,
demonstrated an understanding of the law's intent. &quot;If you
say you're a homosexual,&quot; Walker said, &quot;in order to
rebut the presumption, you can't be a homosexual. A person is
either joking, mistaken, lying or expressing vague desires, as
opposed to propensity.&quot;[6]

<p>

Deputy Solicitor General Kneedler urged the court to &quot;rely
on the policy,&quot; which rationally allows a superior to address
an issue. He noted that the policy works and explained that seven
avowed homosexuals have already rebutted the presumption of conduct
and have been allowed to continue serving. Finally, he recommended
overturning the lower court's decision because the homosexual
members failed to exhaust administrative challenges before taking
their case to court.[7]

<p>

Matthew A. Coles, of the American Civil Liberties Union, argued
that the military has no right to ban either homosexual acts or
their speech. He also challenged the reasoning behind the idea
that homosexuals should have to rebut the presumption that they
will engage in homosexual acts.[8]

<p>

Judge Pierre Leval asked Coles to respond to a parallel situation.
Leval posed the question, what would the military do if someone
declared himself a white supremacist? Coles said the military
would do nothing. But the judge argued that at least the military
would investigate to determine whether the individual intended
to act on his beliefs.[9]

<p>

<center><h3><i>THOMASSON V. PERRY</i></h3></center>

<p>

FRC had the rare privilege to make oral arguments before the Fourth
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., in the case of
<I>Thomasson v. Perry</I>.[10] Lt. Paul G. Thomasson is an avowed
homosexual who petitioned the court to declare the military's
ban unconstitutional. FRC defended the law while the Justice Department
hid behind the Clinton administration's faulty policy.

<p>

This case has followed an unusual track. It began on March 2,
1994, the day Thomasson wrote a letter to his boss at the Bureau
of Naval Personnel in Arlington, Virginia. The letter contained
the declaration, &quot;I am gay.&quot; A Navy administrative board
discharged him June 15,1994 for homosexuality. Thomasson never
admitted to homosexual conduct and failed to rebut the presumption
of misconduct.[11]

<p>

He subsequently filed a motion for relief with the U.S. Federal
Court for the Eastern District of New York asking the court to
declare the military's policy unconstitutional. U.S. District
Judge Claude M. Hilton ruled that the policy was constitutional
upholding Thomasson's honorable discharge. Thomasson's appeal
of that decision was then heard by a three-judge panel from the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Alexandria, Virginia.[12]

<p>

On September 12, 1995, at the appeals court hearing, one of the
judges said the Clinton administration has a &quot;problem&quot;
in defending its &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; policy on homosexuals.
It does not match the intent of Congress.[13]

<p>

Judge J. Michael Luttig told Deputy Solicitor General Edwin Kneedler,
who argued that the Clinton policy is constitutional, &quot;I
think you've got a problem in the government's case.&quot; He
accused the administration of using the policy to make an &quot;end
run&quot; around the Congress.[14]

<p>

All three judges roundly criticized the policy scheme, in particular
the attempted distinction between &quot;orientation&quot; and
&quot;propensity.&quot;[15]

<p>

Allan Moore, Lt. Thomasson's attorney, told the court that the
policy and law violate the constitution's guarantees of free speech
and equal protection. Moore labeled the policy &quot;an Orwellian
concept.&quot; He rejects the notion that the statement, &quot;I
am gay,&quot; presumes misconduct. He argued that the statement
is nothing more than an admission of identity or status.[16]

<p>

Judge Luttig posed a hypothetical case to Mr. Kneedler. What if
I claim to be a communist? Can I rebut the government's presumption
that I will engage in communist activities? The judge then skipped
to the homosexual case. &quot;Okay to think, 'I'm gay,' but can't
say so. But if I say it, I must persuade the decision-maker that
I won't do gay things.&quot; The relationship between &quot;status&quot;
and &quot;propensity&quot; consumed most of the oral argument.[17]

<p>

After the hearing, the three judges signed an order saying they
wanted the full court to rehear the case. At this point, FRC filed
a motion to make oral arguments and, in an unusual move, the court
granted that motion.[18]

<p>

On December 5, the 13 judges of the U.S. Appeals Court for the
Fourth Circuit reheard the case in Richmond, Va. Once again, Judge
Luttig took a conservative stance. He said, &quot;It seems to
me...the Navy is concerned with conduct and not speech.&quot;
Judge Paul V. Niemeyer joined in, &quot;I'm just wondering why
this is a speech case at all.&quot;[19]

<p>

Judge Harvie Wilkinson III said, &quot;Don't we have here a case
where statements are used for evidentiary value, and the First
Amendment never prohibits statements for whatever evidentiary
value they may have?&quot;[20]

<p>

Professor William Woodruff, the Army's former chief of litigation
and now a law professor at Campbell University in North Carolina,
argued for FRC. He explained that the Clinton regulations are
inconsistent with the law. He also pointed out that the old policy
was codified in the new law and declared that the intent of the
law was a classwide bar, that is, homosexuals cannot legally serve.
He called for a faithful execution of the law.

<p>

A decision favorable to conservatives is expected by late spring.
That decision will be in competition with <i>Abel</i> for an appeal to
the Supreme Court this summer.

<p>

<center><h3>RELATED ISSUES</h3></center>

<p>

Other homosexual cases are winding their way through the federal
court system. However, either <I>Thomasson</I> or <I>Abel</I>
will most likely be heard by the high court. That decision will
become a landmark for future homosexual litigation such as the
rising tide of homosexual marriage and adoption cases.

<p>

Meanwhile, in August, 1995, Defense Department general counsel
Judith Miller wrote a memo to the military services which spells
out what to do with those service members who say they are homosexual
and what they must do to remain on active duty.[21] This memo followed
the publicized case of Navy Lieutenant Commander Maria Z. Dunning,
who successfully rebutted the presumption by promising not to
engage in homosexual misconduct.[22]

<p>

The memo gave confused commanders better guidance on proceeding
through the homosexual policy thicket. In spite of the latest
clarification, the number of homosexual discharges are up. From
October 1994 to September 1995, the military services discharged
722 members for homosexuality, a 21 percent increase from the
1994 figure of 597 discharges.[23]

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

No matter which case or combination of cases reaches the Supreme
Court, FRC will file a friend-of-the-court brief and a motion
to make oral argument before the justices. Given past history,
it's reasonable to expect the Clinton Justice Department to under-argue
the case that goes to the high court and, hopefully, FRC's clear
voice defending the law will be heard.

FUTURE YOUTH CRIME<br>

<p>

Violent crime was down 5 percent in the first half of 1995 and
murder dropped 12 percent. This was the largest drop in the murder
rate in years and six times larger than the drop the year prior.[1]

<p>

Some experts attribute the decline to a combination of the aging
of baby boomers, police anti-drug gang efforts and the stabilization
of drug-related turf battles. Alfred Blumstein, a professor at
Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh, observes, &quot;In large
cities, the [drug] markets are most mature. Drug markets started
later in smaller cities, later still in rural areas.&quot;[2] Drug-related
violence may now be shifting to suburbia.

<p>

Thus, Rep. Bill McCollum (R-Fla.), Chairman of the House Judiciary
Subcommittee on Crime, worries that these latest crime statistics
&quot;will give us a false sense of security.&quot;[3] He's not alone.

<p>

Kansas City Mayor Emanuel Cleaver said, &quot;We...have absolutely
no idea why we are experiencing such a precipitous drop [in the
murder rate].&quot;[4] There were 26 percent fewer murders in the
first half of 1995 than the same period the prior year. New York
City's crime rate registered its steepest drop in 23 years.[5]

<p>

Amidst the good news, FBI Director Louis Freeh notes that violent
crime involving young people, both as perpetrators and victims,
is on the rise. &quot;The number of juveniles arrested for weapons
offenses has more than doubled over the past decade,&quot; Freeh
said.[6]

<p>

On a typical day in 1994, nine teenagers in the U.S. were murdered
and 13 teenagers committed a murder.[7] A profile of Justice Department
murder arrest rates by age provides a sobering story. In 1965,
23-year-olds were arrested more often for murder than any other
age group, and their rate was 33 per 100,000 23-year-olds. In
1992, 18-year-olds were arrested more often for murder and their
rate was 97 per 100,000 18-year-olds. That's a 467 percent increase
in murder arrests for 18-year-olds.[8] The trend is toward younger
offenders and higher arrest rates.

<p>

In addition, many experts believe that within the next decade
America will experience an unprecedented surge in youth crime.[9]
According to Attorney General Janet Reno, the problem of children
killing will only worsen because demographics show the key at-risk
population -- 14- to 17-year-olds -- will increase significantly
in years to come.[10]

<p>

<center><h3>WHAT CONTRIBUTES TO THE UPSURGE IN THE NUMBER OF 
YOUNG MURDERERS?</h3></center>

<p>

Social scientists cannot show cause-and-effect relationships for
murder. But they can demonstrate that certain conditions highly
correlate with the increase in juvenile violence.

<p>

<li><b>Parental absence increases a child's likelihood of future
criminal behavior.</b>

<p>

As out-of-wedlock birth has risen, so has the crime rate. Forty-three
percent of all inmates grew up in a single-parent household. Nearly
a third had parents who abused either alcohol or drugs, and more
than a third had at least one family member who was ever incarcerated.[11]

<p>

Cato Institute Chairman William Niskanen said, &quot;A one-percentage-point
increase in births to single mothers appears to increase the violent
crime rate about 1.7 percent.&quot;[12] And a 1990 study by June O'Neill,
a professor with Baruch College of the City University of New
York, shows that men from single-parent families are twice as
likely to commit crimes compared to men from two-parent families.[13]

<p>

Robert Sampson, professor of sociology at the University of Chicago,
notes that it is harder for single-parent families to achieve
the &quot;informal social controls&quot; that limit both crime
and victimization within a community. &quot;There are higher crime
rates in places where communities are not characterized by strong
families,&quot; Sampson said. &quot;The research has been fairly
consistent showing a small-to-moderate positive relationship between
individual delinquency and family breakdown.&quot;[14]

<p>

Even children from two-parent homes suffer when both parents are
absent most of the day due to outside jobs. About 31 million children
under age 15 live with 19 million mothers employed outside the
home. Mothers who work full-time outside the home are four times
more likely to have unsupervised (latchkey) children than moms
who work part-time.[15] This is important, according to a Justice
Department study. It concluded that parental supervision, attachment
to family, and consistency of discipline were the most important
barriers to delinquency and drug abuse.[16]

<p>

Likewise, a study in <I>Child Development</I> found that the fundamental
causes of delinquency are consistent across time and rooted in
generic family processes such as supervision, attachment, and
discipline. This study also found that teenagers whose mothers
who are employed outside the home are more likely to become delinquent
than teenagers whose mothers who are not employed outside the
home. Most adolescents in the low-supervision category (83 percent)
were delinquent compared to 10 percent of those in the high-supervision
category.[17]

<p>

Another study in the <I>Journal of Social Work</I> entitled, &quot;Parenting
in Poverty,&quot; found that for children growing up in very disadvantaged
and violent neighborhoods, the one factor that seems to protect
the child from growing up to be violent is having a parent who
supervises the child very strictly.[18]

<p>

The National Institute of Justice found that being neglected as
a child increases the likelihood of arrest as a juvenile, as an
adult, and for violent crime.[19] This was especially true for juvenile
girls. According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
20 percent of male and female runaways marked parental neglect
as a primary factor for their leaving home.[20]

<p>

Metropolitan Life's 1993 national survey found that teachers (71
percent) and law enforcement officials (90 percent) agree that
the lack of parental supervision at home is a major contributing
factor to violence in schools.[21]

<p>

<li><b>Drug use is highly correlated with delinquent behavior,
and use among adolescents is on the rise.</b>

<p>

A 1994 survey by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) found
that the rate of marijuana use among eighth-graders rose from
6 percent in 1991 to 13 percent in 1994. A similar trend is evident
among 10th- and 12th-graders. Adolescent abuse of cocaine, crack,
heroin, and LSD is also rising.[22]

<p>

Andrew Peyton Thomas, Arizona assistant attorney general and former
NAACP counsel, writes in <I>Crime and the Sacking of America</I>,
&quot;There is...an undeniable relationship between crime and
drugs. Drug addiction can both lower inhibitions among offenders
and spur them on to other crimes to finance their dependency.&quot;
He argues that in spite of the synergism of crime and drugs, analysts
cannot conclude that drugs cause crime. In fact, drugs &quot;do
not ingest themselves.... Drugs reach their human hosts only after
being invited.&quot;[23]

<p>

A Justice Department study of 4,000 urban youths over a five-year
period identified a pattern leading to delinquency.[24] The study
found a direct connection between drug use and delinquency. By
age 16, half of the youth surveyed were using alcohol regularly
and one-quarter were using marijuana.[25]

<p>

The study also found that delinquency starts early. Ten percent
of the 7-year-old boys surveyed reported having committed at least
one street offense. By age 9, the figure was 20 percent and by
17 years of age, 40 percent of the boys had committed at least
one crime.[26]

<p>

<li><b>Most Americans blame the pop culture for increases in youth
violence.</b>

<p>

According to the Family Research Council's 1995 nationwide poll
(conducted by Voter/Consumer Research, a Maryland-based pollster),
more than nine of every 10 Americans believe the media affects
violent crime at least a little.

<p>

Robert McAffee, president of the American Medical Association,
agrees. He said, &quot;If you combine television, motion pictures,
rap music and video games, there's a continuing influence of 
violence....[and] violence is indeed a learned behavior.&quot;[27]

<p>

Senator Bob Dole (R-Kan.) echoed McAffee's view, saying, &quot;Those
who continue to deny that cultural messages can and do bore deep
into the hearts and minds of our young people are deceiving themselves
and ignoring reality.&quot;[28] He called for a boycott of Columbia's
film <I>Money Train</I> following a copycat incident where two
men sprayed flammable liquid through the slot of a Brooklyn subway
token booth, holding a match in the window and seriously burning
the agent inside. The man died several days later.

<p>

But many of Hollywood's elite deny the relationship. Only 30 percent
of media's elite told <I>U.S. News &amp; World Report</I> that
violence in the media contributes to the level of violence in
America.[29] For example, Richard Jewell, a professor in the School
of Cinema-Television at the University of Southern California,
says that Dole's attack is unfair. &quot;The biggest difficulty
with politicians like Dole is that they oversimplify things to
such an extent that we lose sight of the real issues: drugs, families
coming apart, all sort of things that go far beyond media presentation,
Jewell said.&quot;[30]

<p>

But Joel Federman, research director for Mediascope, a Studio
City, Calif.-based public policy group isn't so defensive. He
acknowledges that television violence plays a small but significant
role in promoting more aggressive behavior.[31]

<p>

Robert Butterworth, a Los Angeles-based child psychologist, says
that the average child watches 100,000 acts of television violence
and witnesses 8,000 television murders before the end of elementary
school.[32] This much violence has an effect.[33]

<p>

According to an analysis of 275 studies, George Comstock, the
S.I. Newhouse Professor of Public Communication at Syracuse University,
says that perhaps 10 percent of antisocial and illegal acts can
be linked to television.[34]

<p>

Psychologist Leonard Eron of the University of Michigan's Institute
for Social Research has tracked the television viewing habits
of 650 New York children from 1960 to the present. Those who watched
the most violent programming grew up to be the most aggressive
and crime prone-adults.[35]

<p>

In 1995, the UCLA Center for Communication Policy reviewed numerous
television violence studies. The studies consistently found that
children who view media depictions of aggression became more violent
in their own behavior.[36]

<p>

The National Institute of Mental Health reported that the consensus
in scientific literature is that exposure to television violence
increases children's physical aggressiveness. Senate Judiciary
Committee member Paul Simon (D-Ill.) said he found &quot;nearly
3,000 scholarly articles and studies on the harmful effects of
television violence on children and adults.&quot;[37]

<p>

Murder, which is defined by the FBI as &quot;the willful killing
of one human being by another,&quot; is an aspect of many television
films.[38] Consider these 1995 TV movie titles:

<p>

<I>Death in Small Doses</I> (ABC), <I>Deadline for Murder: From
the Files of Edna Buchanan</I> (CBS), <I>Fatal Vows</I> (CBS),
<I>A Killer Among Friends</I> (CBS), <I>Love Kills: Sweet Justice</I>
(NBC), <I>A Menu for Murder</I> (NBC), <I>The Moment of Truth:
Murder or Memory?</I> (NBC), <I>Marked for Death</I> (CBS), <I>Death
Becomes Her</I> (NBC), <I>The Silence of the Lambs</I> (CBS),
and <I>Falling for You</I> (CBS).

<p>

While television impacts juvenile violence and murder, no one
knows precisely how much. But there are those willing to speculate.
For example, epidemiologist Brandon S. Centerwall told <I>Newsweek</I>
that without television there would be 10,000 fewer murders per
year, 70,000 fewer rapes and 700,000 fewer assaults.[39]

<p>

The music industry shares some of the responsibility. Dr. Joseph
Stuessey, professor of music history at the University of Texas,
told the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee, &quot;Music affects behavior.
This simple fact has been known intuitively for centuries....In
the 20th century, especially in the last four decades, tons of
research has been done on the interrelationship of music and human
behavior....It affects our moods, our attitudes, our emotions,
and our behavior. It affects us psychologically and 
physiologically.&quot;[40]

<p>

Child and adolescent psychiatrist Dr. Robert Demski identifies
music as one of the most powerful influences on youth.[41]

<p>

Dr. Sheila Davis, a professor of lyric writing at New York University,
states that songs &quot;are more than mere mirrors of society;
they are a potent force in the shaping of it....[P]opular songs...provide
the primary 'equipment for living' for America's youth.&quot;[42]

<p>

Pop culture's music is laden with violence. It has themes about
murder, maiming, raping, abusing, and destroying. Rap and heavy
metal are the worst, but others contribute to the promotion of
violence. Some examples of violence-promoting lyrics:

<p><ul>

<li>The Dead Kennedys sing &quot;I Kill Children.&quot; The lyrics
include: &quot;I kill children, I love to see them die. I kill
children to make their mothers cry.&quot;

<p>

<li>Rigor Mortis sings &quot;Bodily Dismemberment.&quot; The lyrics
include: &quot;My fetish is a crime....With five easy slices you're
in six lovely pieces. Bodily dismemberment as passion increases.&quot;

<p>

<li>Blood Feast has a song &quot;Kill for Pleasure&quot; and Motley
Crue has a song &quot;Bastard&quot; about killing someone with
a knife.

</ul><p>

<center><h3>COMING CRIME WAVE</h3></center>

<p>

There are some clear-cut social and demographic trends that make
it very probable that today's shocking stories of youthful violence
will explode over the next decade.

<p>

By the year 2005, the number of teens aged 15 to 19 will increase
by 23 percent and a larger proportion of these teens will be coming
from homes without fathers. Given the correlation between father
absence and crime, some experts estimate that violent crime like
murder could increase to 40,000 killings per year -- that's up
60 percent from the current toll.[43]

<p>

James Q. Wilson, professor of management at the University of
California, Los Angeles and co-editor of the book <I>Crime</I>,
said, &quot;So we should expect, unless something changes dramatically,
that the [now lower] crime rate will go back up.&quot;[44]

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

Americans perceive that crime is getting worse. This may seem
out of line with recent crime statistics, but the changing face
of crime has made citizens feel less safe. Young thugs are now
the threat, and the danger is likely to increase. Defusing the
coming youth time bomb should be a major priority for all levels
of government.

<p>

A courageous soldier has become a pawn in a complex national debate
involving the constitutional separation of powers, foreign policy,
and military law. In the end, America must exercise great caution
when deciding these weighty issues.

<p>

Specialist Michael G. New, a former homeschooler and son of Christian
missionaries, refused to wear a blue beret and a United Nations
(U.N.) patch on his U.S. Army uniform because, he believes, it
violates Army uniform regulations and his enlistment oath which
was to &quot;support and defend the Constitution of the United
States,&quot; not the U.N.

<p>

Specialist New's unit, based in Germany, was alerted last summer
for a peacekeeping mission to the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia (FYROM). His commander ordered a pre-deployment inspection
which included the requirement for all soldiers to appear in formation
wearing their U.S. uniform augmented with a U.N. shoulder patch
and a blue beret. New contends this was an illegal order.

<p>

In August, New told his sergeant that he would disobey an order
to wear the U.N. accouterments on his uniform. After consulting
with his military legal counsel, a chaplain, he flew home from
Germany to discuss his alternatives with his father, his civilian
attorney and congressional representatives. As a result of these
discussions, he decided to disobey the order.

<p>

Specialist New knows that soldiers are expected to obey lawful
orders, and an order to report to duty in a prescribed uniform
is generally a lawful order. However, the government and New disagree
about the Army's authority to prescribe a uniform that includes
the U.N. accouterments.

<p>

In October, after failing to appear in the prescribed uniform,
New was charged with failure to obey an order and offered non-judicial
punishment. Because of his deep conviction on this issue, New
refused non-judicial punishment and asked for a court-martial,
even though this subjected him to potentially much severer punishment
if convicted.

<p>

Specialist New has chosen to fall on his sword to propel onto
the national scene the debate over America's involvement in U.N.-sponsored
peacekeeping missions. This debate ought to be waged by politicians
rather than depending on the martyrdom of an individual soldier.

<p>

<center><h3>THE U.S. MISSION IN MACEDONIA</h3></center>

<p>

Some question the legality of the Macedonian mission. Their concern
centers around the interpretation of the U.N. Charter, which the
U.S. Senate consented to ratify on July 28, 1945 and which was
signed by President Harry Truman on October 31, 1945.

<p>

U.S. Army forces have participated in the ongoing United Nations
Preventive Deployment Force (UNPREDEP) in FYROM as &quot;Task
Force Able Sentry&quot; since July 1993. President Clinton argues
that the Macedonian mission is authorized by Section 2, Clause
1, Article II of the U.S. Constitution which establishes the President
of the United States as the Commander in Chief of the Army and
Navy. In fact, he vetoed the 1996 Defense Authorization Act, in
part, because of his belief that Congress was trying to infringe
upon his authority as Commander in Chief to &quot;assign U.S.
Armed Forces under United Nations operational or tactical 
control.&quot;[1]

<p>

The President has both the constitutional and statutory authority
to employ the armed forces in order to &quot;further U.S. national
interests.&quot; By statute -- Section 7 of the United Nations
Participation Act (22 US Code 287d-1) -- the President may detail
U.S. military personnel to U.N. peacekeeping operations under
Chapter VI of the U.N. Charter to serve as observers, guards,
or in any other noncombatant capacity. Further, under Section
628 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, upon appropriate presidential
determination, U.S. personnel may be assigned or detailed to international
organizations to serve with the international staff of such organizations
or to provide technical, scientific, or professional services
to them.

<p>

The Clinton administration argues that the UNPREDEP was established
as a peacekeeping operation under Chapter VI (Pacific Settlement
of Disputes) of the U.N. Charter, which would mean that the presence
of U.S. troops serving in FYROM is authorized by law. Specialist
New and numerous members of Congress disagree with the administration's
analysis. They contend that this is a Chapter VII (Action with
Respect to Threats to the Peace, Breaches of the Peace, and Acts
of Aggression) mission and is illegal because it was not approved
by Congress.

<p>

On October 6, 1995, 44 members of Congress signed a letter citing
New's case to President Clinton, seeking answers to questions
about America's involvement in U.N. peacekeeping operations. They
asked whether U.S. intervention is in the &quot;national interest,&quot;
if constitutional procedures were respected in the decision to
deploy American troops, and if Americans will be under the command
of foreign officers.[2]

<p>

This politically charged debate illustrates a classic separation
of powers dispute and must be resolved before more Americans are
assigned to U.N. missions.

<p>

<center><h3>THE U.N. IS BECOMING MILITARIZED</h3></center>

<p>

The U.N. has experienced a renaissance with the precipitous fall
of the Soviet Union, rising from near impotence in the early 1980s
to worldwide peacemaker in 1995. This transition has been marked
both by a change in operational philosophy and the expansion of
a blue-helmeted legion of peace-enforcers.

<p>

There is little doubt that the U.N. would not exist today if it
were not for U.S. membership and support. The American taxpayer
has paid a disproportionate part of the U.N. budget. The recent
surge in U.N. military operations should concern American policymakers.

<p>

The U.N. operational philosophy and military role have radically
changed. In the U.N.'s first five years, it launched only two
peacekeeping missions. Since the fall of the Soviet Union, the
U.N. has mounted 19 operations involving more than 70,000 blue-helmeted
soldiers. Last year these operations cost $3.6 billion. Of this,
the U.S. was directly assessed $1.2 billion by the U.N., and the
Clinton administration spent another $1.7 billion for U.S. military
participation in U.N. missions. Today, thousands of American soldiers
wear U.N. blue helmets in 10 countries ranging from Haiti to Lebanon
to the former Yugoslav republics.

<p>

The U.N. has dramatically expanded its use of military forces
in peacekeeping operations. The U.N. Department of Peacekeeping
has expanded from a staff of 23 to more than 350 with a modern
situation center, staffed 24 hours a day, linked electronically
to all U.N. hot spots. It has a standby system to tap troops and
equipment from 185 member nations, and it has established a storage
base in Italy to stockpile equipment such as armored personnel
carriers for rapid deployment to peacekeeping missions.[3]

<p>

The United States Senate has the constitutional authority and
obligation to determine whether continued American membership
in the U.N. serves a useful purpose. A significant question is
whether the militarization of the U.N. is in this country's best
interests.

<p>

<center><h3>CLINTON ADMINISTRATION LIKES THE U.N.</h3></center>

<p>

In 1994, the Clinton administration issued Presidential Decision
Directive 25 on reforming multilateral peacekeeping operations.
This was supposed to make them more selective and more effective.
The directive claims, &quot;The U.S. does not support a standing
U.N. Army, nor will we earmark specific U.S. military units for
participation in U.N. operations.&quot;

<p>

Despite this assurance, White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry
has said that President Clinton supports America's continued U.N.
involvement[4] and Madeleine K. Albright, U.S. Permanent Representative
to the United Nations, told Congress, &quot;The Clinton administration
believes very deeply in the potential of the U.N. system.&quot;[5]

<p>

The Clinton administration has supported the U.N.'s radical transformation,
but some Americans don't share this optimism. Presidential hopeful
Senator Bob Dole (R-Kan.) has said, &quot;It is high time we rein
in U.N. peacekeeping, which is out of control.&quot; Senator Jesse
Helms (R-N.C.) has called the U.N. &quot;the nemesis of millions
of Americans.&quot;[6]

<p>

These are early warning signs that must not be ignored. History
teaches that the acquisition of military power traditionally has
been the first step toward establishing governance over a territory.
Coupling the U.N.'s changing military strength with the new operational
philosophy favoring individual over state sovereignty sends a
warning shot across the bow of free people around the world.

<p>

<center><h3>NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AT RISK</h3></center>

<p>

Franklin D. Roosevelt envisioned the U.N. dealing with traditional
interstate aggression rather than the types of internal conflict
that now dominate. But the 50-year-old organization is transitioning
to the &quot;new world order.&quot; That change is echoed by U.N.
Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, who has issued <I>An
Agenda for Peace</I> suggesting a greatly expanded U.N. peacemaking
role. He endorses the principle of &quot;universal sovereignty&quot;:
&quot;Underlying the rights of the individual and the rights of
peoples is a dimension of universal sovereignty that resides in
all humanity and provides all peoples with legitimate involvement
in issues affecting the world as a whole.&quot;

<p>

Boutros-Ghali has used this concept to sanction U.N. efforts in
Somalia, saying, &quot;The magnitude of the human tragedy constitutes
a threat to international peace and security.&quot; Thus, he justified
the world body's intervention in the sovereign affairs of a nation-state
without invitation. The same happened in Iraq after the Gulf War.

<p>

Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait posed a classic situation for the
U.N. It was a case of aggression in which the armies of one state
crossed international borders to invade another. Desert Shield/Storm
was a successful international effort to reject the invaders and
restore the sovereignty of Kuwait. The subsequent 1991 U.N.-sanctioned
incursion into northern Iraq to protect the Kurds (Operation Provide
Comfort), however, was the first time the Security Council authorized
the use of force in the strictly internal affairs of a member
state. Thus began a potentially dangerous new era for U.N. 
&quot;peacemaking.&quot;

<p>

&quot;Loose constructionists of the U.N. Charter believe the existence
of such problems justifies expanding U.N. jurisdictions to deal
with them,&quot; says former U.S. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick,
who warns, &quot;We are slipping into practices which enhance
only the power of the strongest. Is this what we want to do? Someone
had better think through this question -- and soon.&quot;[7]

<p>

But Boutros-Ghali awards supremacy of rights to individuals and
groups within countries. He argues that &quot;the centuries-old
doctrine of absolute and exclusive sovereignty no longer stands.&quot;
Apparently, then, outside forces do have a right to trump national
sovereignty. Does this, then, mean or imply that true sovereignty
resides with the U.N., individual nationhood be damned?

<p>

The U.N.'s implied &quot;right&quot; to intervene in the sovereign
affairs of a country leaves all member countries vulnerable including
the U.S. For example, the next time Korean-Americans bear the
brunt of a Los Angeles riot, the South Korean government could
ask the U.N. to intervene to protect its citizens' rights. It
couldn't happen now because the U.S. would veto the move procedurally
and militarily. But it could happen in the future, especially
if the U.N. has a standing military governed by a liberal world
elite.

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

The national debate fostered by Specialist New's case is important.
It comes at a time when American troops are involved in peacekeeping
missions around the world. It has taken the courageous act of
one soldier to highlight an issue that deserves serious debate
and resolution.

<title>A TWO-YEAR UPDATE ON HOMOSEXUALS IN THE MILITARY</title>

<h2>A TWO-YEAR UPDATE ON<br>
HOMOSEXUALS IN THE<br>
MILITARY</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<i>Lieutenant Colonel Robert L. Maginnis (U.S.A., Ret.)</i></center>

<p>

One of Bill Clinton's first acts as president was to try to pry
open the military to service by homosexuals. That effort met with
great opposition and led to a Democratic Congress codifying the
military's long-standing ban on homosexual service. But the Clinton
administration did an end run around that law and wrote implementing
regulations that are inconsistent with the law and that have caused
considerable confusion.

<p>

The second anniversary of the implementation of these regulations
was used to expose that confusion. On February 27, 1996, the Washington-based
Servicemembers Legal Defense Network, an advocacy organization
for homosexuals in the military, claimed to have documented 363
cases in the last year in which military officials violated the
Clinton administration's homosexual regulations by directly asking
members about their sexual orientation or harassing members suspected
of being homosexual. As evidence, it cited rising discharges for
homosexuality.[1]

<p>

The Pentagon discharged 722 homosexual service members in fiscal
1995, compared with 597 in 1994. The Pentagon attributes the 17
percent increase to a different reporting method by the Air Force.
There were 949 discharges for homosexuality in 1991, 708 in 1992
and 682 in 1993.[2]

<p>

Prior to 1994 the Air Force, when it found homosexual activity
during basic training, discharged that person for &quot;fraudulent
enlistment&quot; rather than for homosexuality. This procedure
changed in 1994, and that's why there is an increase in the number
of homosexual discharges in 1995. Discounting 163 Air Force discharges
that fit this category, the Pentagon's 1995 figure would be 559,
the lowest in many years.[3]

<p>

The Servicemembers Legal Defense Network has accused military
officials of overstepping their bounds to conduct &quot;witch
hunts&quot; to find evidence to discharge service members for
homosexuality. It cited the case of an Army woman who charged
that several drunken male soldiers had attempted to rape her.
She reported the incident, but her commander dismissed it. She
alleges the men then started rumors that she was a
lesbian and that this led to an investigation. The Army says it
dropped the case against the woman and is investigating whether
the commander went too far.[4]

<p>

Military investigators and commanders are also accused of pursuing
wide-ranging inquiries aimed at identifying homosexual members.
But the Pentagon dismisses the allegations of abuse. It claims
to have &quot;thoroughly investigated&quot; them to ensure fair
application of the policy.

<p>

The confusion about homosexual service is prompted by the stark
differences between Clinton's regulations and the law which is
a codified version of the military's long-standing ban. The Clinton
administration's regulations are contrary to the law passed by
Congress and signed by the President on November 30, 1993. Consider
the major differences:

<p><ul>

<li>The Clinton regulations [DOD Directives 1332.14 and 1332.30]
drop the principled statement that &quot;homosexuality is incompatible
with military service.&quot;

<p>

<li>The law [10 U.S.C. &#167; 654] forbids service by homosexuals.
The Clinton regulations permit service by &quot;celibate&quot;
homosexuals.

<p>

<li>The law requires the discharge of people with a &quot;propensity&quot;
to engage in homosexual conduct. The Clinton regulations redefine
&quot;propensity&quot; to mean the narrow term &quot;likelihood.&quot;

<p>

<li>The law relies on commander discretion to initiate investigations.
The Clinton regulations create a &quot;criminal-like&quot; standard
before investigations can be initiated. According to Secretary
of Defense William Perry, attending gay pride parades, frequenting
gay bars, and possessing gay materials are not &quot;credible&quot;
evidence to initiate an investigation.

<p>

<li>The Clinton regulations prevent military criminal investigators
from investigating adult private consensual sexual misconduct
(sodomy and adultery). The law relies on commander discretion
to initiate investigations.

<p>

<li>The law forbids homosexual service for readiness reasons,
but, contrary to 200 years of military practice, Clinton's Defense
Department no longer considers homosexual behavior a marker for
increased security risk. And information discovered during a security
investigation cannot be used for adverse action without high-level
political permission.

</ul><p>

<center><h3>STATUS OF FEDERAL COURT CASES</h3></center>

<p>

Confusion on the issue of homosexuals in the military is amplified
by the many pending federal court cases. There are five military
homosexual cases now pending at the federal appellate court level
and three cases at the district court level.[5] Most of these cases
involve servicemembers complaining that their constitutional rights
have been violated by Clinton's regulations and sidestep a frontal
attack on the law which clearly denies service by homosexuals.

<p><ul>

<li><I>Abel v. Perry</I> was heard on January 16, 1996 in the
United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. This case
involves six servicemembers who won at the district court level,
claiming that the Pentagon violated their First and Fifth Amendment
rights. This case contests Clinton's regulations and avoids the
plain meaning of the law. A decision is expected this spring.

<p>

<li><I>Thomasson v. Perry</I> was heard on December 5, 1995 in
the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. It
involves a Naval officer who complains that his discharge for
homosexuality violates his First and Fifth Amendment rights. The
government won at the trial court level. A decision is expected
this spring.

<p>

<li><I>Selland v. Department of Defense</I> was decided at the
district court level for the government on October 31, 1995. The
case was brought by a Naval officer dismissed for declaring himself
a homosexual. The plaintiff has indicated he will appeal, but
that appeal will be delayed until a decision is announced in the
<I>Thomasson v. Perry</I> case.

<p>

<li><I>Phillips v. Perry </I>will be heard on March 4, 1996 in
the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. This
case involves a sailor who claims his discharge is based on homosexual
&quot;status&quot; when in fact the Navy was swayed by his admission
of misconduct. He also claims there are sexual acts that are guaranteed
protection within a constitutionally protected zone of privacy.
He lost his complaint at the trial court level. A decision is
expected this summer.

<p>

<li><I>Richenberg v. Perry</I> will be heard this spring in the
United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. This Air
Force officer was discharged for homosexuality and lost at the
trial court level.

<p>

<li>Three cases are pending at the federal district court level.
They are: <I>Thorne v. Department of Defense</I> (U.S. District
Court for the Eastern District of Virginia; brought by a Naval
officer); <I>Holmes v. California National Guard</I> (U.S. District
Court for the Northern District of California; brought by a National
Guardsman); and <I>Watson v. Perry</I> (U.S. District Court for
the Western District of Washington; brought by a Naval officer).

</ul><p>

The Family Research Council has participated as an amicus (friend
of the court) in the five appellate cases. It was granted the
unusual opportunity to make oral argument in <I>Thomasson v. Perry,</I>
where FRC defended the law and the Clinton Justice Department
defended the faulty regulations. It will closely monitor the progress
of the three district court cases.

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

A Justice Department attorney announced during the <I>Abel v.
Perry</I> hearing that seven avowed homosexuals have rebutted
the presumption that they will engage in illicit conduct. They
now serve uncontested. This is a flagrant violation of the law
but has been allowed because of the faulty Clinton regulations.
Unless these regulations are changed, more avowed homosexuals
will serve, despite clear congressional intent to the contrary.

<p>

The intent of the law has always been to deny service to homosexuals.
It is the Constitutional responsibility of Congress under Article
1, Section 8 to write the rules and regulations for the military.
After exhaustive hearings in 1993, the Congress by a large majority
codified the military's long-standing ban on homosexual service.
The law denies service to all homosexuals, both those in and those
out of the closet.

<p>

It is hoped that Congress or a future administration will right
the Clinton administration's faulty regulations. The regulations
must be rewritten to echo the intent of the law. Meanwhile, it
is expected that either the <I>Abel</I> or <I>Thomasson</I> case
will be appealed to the Supreme Court this summer. FRC will file
a motion to argue as an amicus in that case to defend the law
which is based on the will of the American people and the findings
of the 1993 Congressional hearings on the issue of homosexuals
in the military.

A: Marriage has been the foundation of civilization for thousands
of years in cultures around the world. It is the single most important
social institution, and it is the basis for the procreation of
children and the heart of family life. Those who are trying to
radically redefine it for their own purposes are the ones who
are trying to impose their values on the rest of the population.
Ordinary people did not pick this fight. They are not the aggressors.
They are merely defending the basic morality that has sustained
the culture for everyone against a radical attack.

<p>

<b>Q: Oh, come on. Whom does it really hurt if a same-sex couple
want to get married?</b>

<p>

A: When homosexual couples seek state approval and all the benefits
that the state reserves for married couples, they impose the law
on everyone. According non-marital relationships the same status
as marriage would mean that millions of people would be disenfranchised
by their own governments. The state would be telling them that
their beliefs are no longer valid, and would turn the civil rights
laws into a battering ram against them:

<p><ul>

<li>Business men and women would be required to provide &quot;family&quot;
health benefits to homosexual couples.

<p>

<li>Children would be taught in schools that homosexual sex is
the moral equivalent of marital love.

<p>

<li>Same-sex &quot;marriage&quot; would facilitiate the adoption
of children by homosexual couples.

<p>

<li>Sex-based distinctions in the law would be removed (as was
proposed in the rejected Equal Rights Amendment).

</ul><p>

Law is not a suggestion, but, as George Washington observed, it
is force. Official state sanction of same-sex relationships as
&quot;marriage&quot; would bring the full apparatus of the state
against those who believe that marriage is between one man and
one woman. Traditional morality would, in effect, be outlawed.

<p>

<b>Q: But if two people -- any two people -- love each other,
why not let them marry?</b>

<p>

A: Marriage is not just a matter of feelings. It is the specifically
defined legal, social, economic and spiritual union of a man and
a woman. The two sexes must be present for it to be marriage.
If that definition is radically altered based on the &quot;feelings&quot;
of those in other relationships, then the sky is the limit. There
is no logical reason for not letting several people marry, or
for gutting other requirements, such as minimum age, blood relative
status or even the limitation of the relationship to human beings.

<p>

<b>Q: Don't morals change? Haven't we heard all these tired phrases
used in defense of not letting women vote or even in defense of
slavery?</b>

<p>

A: Various social movements have succeeded because they were in
accord with natural law and the basic precepts of the moral code.
Homosexuality has never been considered morally good, and it is
a quantum leap from ending slavery to saying that homosexuality
must now be considered good, healthy and worthy of state-protected
benefits. Homosexuals enjoy all the rights every other citizen
already has -- they can vote, own property, etc.-- but they cannot
claim special treatment beyond those rights. Anytime they achieve
that, they threaten the civil rights of those who disagree with
them.

<p>

<b>Q: For years, in some Southern states, blacks and whites were
prevented from marrying by anti-miscegenation laws. Eventually,
the courts overturned these laws. Aren't same-sex couples being
similarly discriminated against? Isn't it only a matter of time
before these repressive laws are also overturned?</b>

<p>

A: As Colin Powell has observed, skin color and sexual behavior
are entirely different. The first is a benign, inborn characteristic
that has no bearing on conduct or character; the second is behaviorally-based
and has everything to do with character, morality and society's
basic rules of conduct. If the civil rights laws begin deviating
into behavior and away from race, ethnic origin, place of birth
or other immutable characteristics, there is no stopping point.
New laws would have to be coined almost daily to accommodate the
flood of claims based on behavior (smokers, compulsive gamblers,
pornography fanatics, sex addicts and pedophiles could all claim
new &quot;rights&quot; to protection against discrimination).
One non-immutable characteristic that does get protection is religion,
because that is enshrined in the Constitution. But there is no
constitutional right to engage in sodomy (see <I>Bowers v. Hardwick</I>)[1]
and demand that the state elevate it into protected status.

<p>

<b>Q: But studies show that homosexuals are born that way. How
then can you blame them for their condition?</b>

<p>

A: Nobody is &quot;blaming&quot; anyone for having homosexual
desires. The &quot;genetic&quot; studies that have been publicized
have been conducted by self-styled homosexual activists or have
been misrepresented in the media. The studies themselves typically
have tiny sample sizes, biased selection, and other major methodological
flaws, and are not replicated by reputable scientists.[2] By contrast,
70 years of therapeutic counseling and case studies show a remarkable
consistency concerning the origins of the homosexual impulse as
an uncompleted gender identity seeking after its own sex to replace
what was not fully developed.[3] Do homosexuals choose to be gay?
Mostly, no, but they can choose their behavior, and they can change
their orientation,[4] as researchers Masters and Johnson showed in
their landmark studies[5] and as numerous examples of successful
personal transformation testify.[6]

<p>

<b>Q: Isn't the traditional view of marriage religious in nature?
And if so, doesn't the restriction of marriage to one man and
one woman violate the religious beliefs of those who disagree?</b>

<p>

A: Although marriage does indeed arise from religious traditions,
most notably the Bible, it is an independently quantifiable good
for society. Hence, the state has an interest in preserving and
protecting the special status of marriage, regardless of religious
beliefs. A society can get along just fine without any homosexuality,
but no society can get along without marriage. That is why the
state encourages marriage. In 1885, the Supreme Court felt so
strongly that marriage was to be protected that it declared it
as a requirement for admission of new states to the Union. Any
prospective state, the court said, had to have law resting &quot;on
the basis of the idea of the family, as consisting in and springing
from the union for life of one man and one woman in the holy estate
of matrimony; the sure foundation of all that is stable and noble
in our civilization, the best guaranty of that reverent morality
which is the source of all beneficent progress in social and political
improvement.&quot;[7]

<p>

<b>Q: What about childless couples? Since you say that marriage
must be protected partly because of its importance in forming
families, does this mean that heterosexual couples who do not
have children shouldn't get marriage licenses?</b>

<p>

A: Of course not. Although most people marry with the intention
of someday starting families, the married couples who do not have
children still have the potential for becoming mothers and fathers,
either biologically or through adoption. Marriage is a societal
good even without children, as husbands and wives serve as role
models for children in their neighborhoods. Procreation is an
important aspect of society's high regard for marriage, but it
is not the only reason marriage is protected. Children do not
benefit when homosexuality is presented as a neutral or positive
lifestyle choice.

<p>

<b>Q: But with the threat of AIDS and other diseases among promiscuous,
homosexual men, wouldn't it be a societal good to encourage homosexual
monogamy?</b>

<p>

A: In cities where homosexual monogamy is already being encouraged,
AIDS and other sexually-transmitted diseases are skyrocketing.[8]
It is not &quot;homophobia&quot; that is causing this, but the
behavior itself, which is destructive emotionally, physically
and morally to individuals, families and societies. That is why
it has been discouraged in all successful cultures. Socrates and
Plato wrote that homosexuality was harmful to individuals and
society and should be discouraged. Even in &quot;steady&quot;
homosexual relationships, dangerous sex occurs, since the defining
homosexual sex act is patently unhealthy by any standard. State
sanction of homosexuality in any form is an invitation to the
young to experiment with something that may prove deadly. Any
public health benefits available by discouraging promiscuous homosexual
activity can be achieved without redefining traditional marriage,
which is per se a profoundly important public health measure.

<p>

Besides, homosexual literature acknowledges that homosexual 
&quot;monogamy&quot; is largely fictional. Most homosexual relationships 
are fleeting. Those that endure more than a few years do so because of an 
agreement to have outside partners. As <I>New Republic</I> editor Andrew
Sullivan, a homosexual, writes in his book <I>Virtually Normal</I>,
&quot;the openness of the contract&quot; of homosexual &quot;marriage&quot;
reflects &quot;greater understanding of the need for extramarital
outlets between two men than between a man and a woman.&quot;
In other words, the homosexual concept of &quot;monogamy&quot;
is non-monogamous. Homosexual activist Michaelangelo Signorile
frankly admits that the goal of homosexual activists is to &quot;fight
for same-sex marriage and its benefits and then, once granted,
redefine the institution of marriage completely, to demand the
right to marry not as a way of adhering to society's moral codes
but rather to debunk a myth and radically alter an archaic 
institution....&quot;[9]

<p>

<b>Q: Don't most people want homosexuals to be treated fairly?</b>

<p>

A: Yes. Most people have no ill will toward homosexuals, but this
does not mean that a tiny segment of the population (less than
2 percent) should be allowed to radically redefine society's moral
code. Even in liberal Hawaii, recent polls show that more than
70 percent of residents oppose same-sex &quot;marriage,&quot;
and national polls show that about two-thirds of respondents oppose
same-sex &quot;marriage.&quot; This is not about tolerance, but
about a tiny group seeking to use the law to impose its version
of morality on everyone else.

<p>

<b>Q: Still, don't homosexuals suffer discrimination when they
can't marry?</b>

<p>

A: No. Homosexuals have precisely the same right to marry as anyone
else. Marriage is the bringing together of the two sexes. That
is the whole point. To enter marriage, you must meet its qualifications.
Any attempt to get around the rules that everyone else plays by
is an attempt to have special rights, not equal rights. Eliminating
an entire sex from the picture and then calling it &quot;marriage&quot;
is not a mere expansion of an institution, but rather the destruction
of a principle.

<p>

<b>Q: What about domestic partnerships? If you won't go along
with same-sex &quot;marriage,&quot; why not at least allow committed
same-sex couples to get some benefits?</b>

<p>

A: The state should never be in the business of encouraging unhealthy
behavior by granting special benefits for it. A homosexual life
does not offer the richness of the complementary relationship
that men and women find in marriage and family life. People should
not be written off as if they can do no better than be mired in
an unhealthy, unnatural behavior. The more that homosexuality
is encouraged, the more damage will be wreaked among individuals,
families and society. This is not compassion but its opposite:
a ruthless social Darwinism that devalues people as impulse-driven
incorrigibles. Each human soul is of inestimable worth, and homosexuals
are no different from anyone else. They deserve the truth, not
an officially sanctioned lie.

<h2>DESIGNER DRUGS MAKE A<br>
COMEBACK</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>

<p>

A 1960s-era designer drug is making a dramatic comeback and may
do to the 1990s what cocaine did to the 1980s. The use of methamphetamine,
known on the street as speed, ice, crank, crystal meth or the
&quot;poor man's coke,&quot; is rising dramatically.

<p>

<center><h3>WHAT IS METH?</h3></center>

<p>

Meth is a synthetic central-nervous system stimulant of the amphetamine
family. It was discovered by a Japanese chemist in 1919, and was
used extensively by all sides during World War II to fight fatigue
and enhance performance.

<p>

In small doses, meth has been used by combat pilots to keep alert,
and by astronauts to be ready for critical decisions at the end
of long missions. A <I>USA Today</I> story last fall claimed President
John F. Kennedy used small quantities, and that German dictator
Adolph Hitler was known to be a meth abuser.[1]

<p>

<center><h3>HOW DOES METH AFFECT THE USER?</h3></center>

<p>

Larry Lewman, Oregon State Examiner, said, &quot;It's not as lethal
[as crack], but it's cheaper. And it causes a toxic psychosis
and (users) can be absolutely irrational for days.&quot;[2]

<p>

Meth can have a bizarre effect on some. While high on meth, Eric
Smith thought his 14-year-old son was demon-possessed. He murdered
his son, cut off the boy's head, and tossed it out of the window
of his van.[3]

<p>

Such irrational and often violent behavior is common among meth
abusers. According to Dr. Alex Stalcup, former medical director
of the Haight-Asbury free clinic, &quot;I have [meth] patients
come in with as much as 19 to 20 days of no sleep. They are very
dangerous, paranoid, talking weapons. Some hold themselves in
a house, take hostages and begin shooting out the windows.&quot;[4]

<p>

Ronald Siegel, a psychopharmacologist at the UCLA school of medicine,
said of meth users, &quot;They're wired to be alert, on guard
and primed for action.&quot;[5]

<p>

The downside of meth's euphoria is an amphetamine psychosis. It
can last for months. The person becomes agitated, on edge and
paranoid. A meth crash can be deadly for children, spouses and
friends of the user.

<p>

The signs of meth abuse are: weight loss, irritability, excitability,
paranoia, wandering attention, sleeplessness for days and then
sleeping for 24 to 36 hours straight.[6]

<p>

<center><h3>WHERE DOES METH COME FROM?</h3></center>

<p>

In the late 1980s, traffickers and clandestine laboratory operators
discovered that ma huang, an extract from the ephedra plant, the
world's oldest known cultivated plant, could be used to produce
methamphetamine. This discovery prompted the U.S. government to
impose controls on ephedrine.

<p>

The ephedra plant is grown in China, India, the Czech Republic
and, at one time, was sown as a ground cover in the western U.S.
by the Bureau of Plant Industry. Frontier Americans called ephedrine
&quot;Mormon tea&quot; because it was drunk by Mormons in lieu
of regular coffee and tea, which are off-limits. It was also called
&quot;whorehouse tea&quot; because settlers believed it cured
venereal disease.[7]

<p>

Although ephedrine is not sold in large quantities for fear it
will be used to produce meth, it is legally available as a treatment
for asthma. Pseudoephedrine is readily available as a nasal decongestant.
Ephedrine tablets are also sold as an herbal supplement under
such names as &quot;Trim Easy,&quot; &quot;Ecstasy&quot; and 
&quot;Bliss&quot; at rock concerts or hip clothing boutiques and 
&quot;Ephedra&quot; in health food stores.[8] It can be found in some new 
herbal sodas. Bodybuilders also use it for short-term energy boosts.

<p>

In 1988, Congress passed the Chemical Diversion and Trafficking
Act, which imposed controls on bulk ephedrine powder. Thereafter,
meth producers sought international sources and began to switch
to pseudoephedrine as their source chemical.

<p>

Meth can be &quot;cooked&quot; by amateurs with a few simple chemicals
in makeshift labs. Some of these labs can produce up to 100 pounds
at a time. In February 1995, Mexican authorities seized a lab
that could produce 2,640 pounds of meth a month.[9]

<p>

Even a makeshift lab can take $4,000 in raw ingredients and produce
eight pounds of meth worth more than $50,000 on the street.[10] Besides
the danger of arrest for producing illegal substances, lab mistakes
can be catastrophic.

<p>

On Christmas Day, 1995, a mobile home near Aguanga, California
burst into flames. Three children died and an out-of-control meth
kitchen was blamed.[11]

<p>

Authorities busted 419 clandestine labs in California in 1994,
and the deadly environmental residue from these labs cost that
state more than $1 million in clean-up.[12] Although the number of
meth lab seizures rose to 683 in 1989, they dramatically declined
with new laws restricting ephedrine's availability.[13] Today, the
number of labs is rising once again as alternative ephedrine sources
have been found.

<p>

<center><h3>WHO USES METH?</h3></center>

<p>

Meth is tailor-made for the fast-paced 1990s. It helps suppress
the appetite, gives self-confidence, provides an extended feeling
of euphoria, and provides &quot;Energizer&quot; levels of get-up-and-go.

<p>

Kathy Paddock, a services coordinator for Terros, an Arizona-based
drug and mental health rehabilitation center, said, &quot;We're
seeing young people in their teens, young adults, everyone. It's
the drug of the '90s. People are needing to go fast -- alter their
moods. The meths are replacing crack.&quot;[14]

<p>

One study found that 75 percent of meth users were employed white
men between the ages 25 and 35.[15] Robert Booth, a psychiatry professor
at Colorado University's medical school, says meth attracts middle-class
housewives with too much to do.[16] <I>The U.S. News &amp; World Report</I>
describes meth users as white, 18-to-34-year-old working class
people, &quot;some of them gay and many of them women.&quot;[17]

<p>

Ed Mayer, head of the narcotics enforcement team in Jackson County,
Oregon, says meth is &quot;cheaper [than cocaine] and it gives
people a longer high.&quot;[18] That's why it is growing in popularity,
especially among adolescent girls who want to lose weight and
boys who use it as a sexual stimulant.[19]

<p>

<center><h3>THE NEW METH EPIDEMIC</h3></center>

<p>

Just how bad is the meth &quot;epidemic&quot; and what are the
consequences? Consider:

<p><ul>

<li>The Department of Justice reports that meth abuse has risen
between 500 and 800 percent among young adults over the past five
years.[20]

<p>

<li>The nation's medical examiners report a 144 percent rise in
meth-related deaths from 1992 to 1994.[21] There were 1,816 meth-related
deaths reported from 1991 to 1994.[22] Eighty percent of these were
reported in just <i>four</i> big western cities.[23]

<p>

<li>Meth-related hospital emergency room admissions have risen
366 percent over the last 10 years in California.[24] In some local
areas they have risen 1,742 percent.[25] The problem is so bad that
in one California hospital meth babies now outnumber crack babies
by as much as seven to one.[26]

<p>

<li>In Phoenix, meth-related crimes have jumped 400 percent in
the last three years.[27] Officials believe meth is largely responsible
for a 40 percent jump in Phoenix's 1994 homicide rate. Phoenix's
law enforcement authorities also report spending 60 percent of
their time working on cases involving meth.[28]

<p>

<li>In Contra Costa County, near San Francisco, police say that
meth was involved in 89 percent of domestic disputes.[29] San Diego
County reports that meth detections among arrestees rose from
23 percent in 1991 to 45 percent in 1994.[30]

<p>

<li>Authorities in San Diego and the San Francisco Bay area report
nearly 3,000 admissions to treatment programs for meth. This is
up from only 600 in 1988.[31]

<p>

<li>Meth is making inroads elsewhere. Of 100 women recently booked
into the Minneapolis jail, 75 had meth traces in their urine.[32]
In Tacoma, Washington, police report that meth-related homicides
are on the rise.[33]

</ul><p>

Recognizing the critical nature of the coming tidal wave of meth
abuse, on March 12, 1996, Senator Diane Feinstein (D-Calif.) introduced
legislation aimed at curbing the manufacturing of methamphetamine.
The Methamphetamine Control Act of 1996, which has bipartisan
support, tightens federal regulation and reporting requirements
for the chemicals used to produce meth, and increases criminal
penalties for possession of the relevant chemicals or equipment
with the intent to manufacture the drug.

<p>

Public officials are nearly unanimous in condemning meth and warning
Americans about its likely impact. Attorney General Janet Reno
warned, &quot;There should be no question...in anybody's mind
that methamphetamine poses a real and serious threat to the citizens
of our nation.&quot;[34]

<p>

Drug Enforcement Administration head Thomas A. Constantine told
a U.S. House Judiciary subcommittee: &quot;I am concerned that
this coming epidemic could not happen at a worse time. Our nation
has not yet fully recovered from our cocaine experience, and powerful
traffickers in Mexico are seeking to make their mark on history
in much the same way the Cali Mafia did.&quot;[35]

<p>

Dr. Andrew Mecca with the California Alcohol and Drug Programs
participated in a meth study which found &quot;that we have got
a dramatic rise or epidemic level of occurrence.&quot;[36]

<p>

John Coonce, the meth task force chief for the DEA, said, &quot;We're
seeing more [meth] labs in middle American. It's an epidemic that's
getting worse.&quot;[37]

<p>

<center><h3>DRUG TRAFFICKERS FIND METH BETTER THAN CRACK</h3></center>

<p>

Today, meth is available in large quantities. Last year about
170 tons of ephedrine was converted into 136 tons of meth, which
was sold on U.S. streets for about $3.2 billion. That's enough
meth to supply 12.4 million abusers with three 10-milligram doses
a day for 365 days a year.[38]

<p>

Meth production and distribution have become a big business. In
the 1970s, meth was largely the province of motorcycle gangs.
But in the 1980s making meth from ephedrine became an easy and
lucrative alternative to processing and selling cocaine. It became
attractive because domestic traffickers could cut out middlemen
like the Colombian cartels.

<p>

There are three categories of meth traffickers. Those who traffic
in the raw materials -- primarily ephedrine or pseudoephedrine
-- to producers, those who peddle the finished product, and those
who do both.

<p>

The raw material traffickers either operate domestically or internationally.
The domestic operators divert legal ephedrine to meth lab operators.
For example, Clifton Pharmaceuticals in western Pennsylvania imported
large quantities of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine powder last
year. From the powder they made pills, which were then sold through
three mail order firms located in Florida and Kentucky. The DEA
routinely seized these products in clandestine meth labs in California.[39]

<p>

Ephedrine tablets were sold through mail order distributors in
100 and 1,000-count bottles through magazines like <I>Cosmopolitan,
High Times</I> and <I>Hustler</I>.[40] They were advertised as 
bronchodilators, energy boosters or diet aids. This practice has now been 
slowed by the 1990 Domestic Chemical Diversion Control Act, because the
DEA can now deny registration to companies whose actions are deemed
to pose an imminent threat to public health and safety. Unfortunately,
the Food and Drug Administration has yet to reclassify pseudoephedrine
as a controlled substance.

<p>

Mexican drug organizations are the primary traffickers in raw
ephedrine. They ship large quantities of ephedrine from India,
China and the Czech Republic into Mexico and then either make
meth at local labs or smuggle it into the U.S. For example, in
1994, 3.4 tons of ephedrine traveling from Zurich to Mexico City
was seized by the customs service at Dallas-Fort Worth International
Airport.[41]

<p>

Mexican finished-product traffickers have so saturated the Western
meth market as to depress its street value. In 1991, a pound of
meth cost $6,000, but today the price has been cut in half.[42] That
makes meth a real psychedelic bargain when compared to crack cocaine.
For example, $20 can buy a quarter gram of meth or one-tenth of
a gram of crack or one-sixteenth of a gram of heroin.[43]

<p>

<center><h3>HOW TO HEAD OFF THE COMING EPIDEMIC</h3></center>

<p>

This country needs a three-part, balanced strategy to stop the
meth epidemic. This strategy must include strong enforcement,
prevention, and effective meth-abuse treatment with accountability.
Enforcement begins with the right laws. Congress already has laws
that tightly control the sale of ephedrine powder, but should
consider more restrictions on the over-the-counter sale of pseudoephedrine
tablets. Feinstein's proposal closes a loophole in the Controlled
Substances Act by removing an exemption for pseudoephedrine. It
also adds needed restrictions on other chemicals used to produce
methamphetamine. Meth producers can now make cash purchases of
large quantities of red phosphorus, iodine and hydrochloric gas
-- chemicals used to make meth. There are no uniform reporting
requirements or quantity limitations for these chemicals.[44]

<p>

The pending bill would restrict access to these chemicals and
impose a civil &quot;three-strikes-and-you're-out&quot; law for
companies that are found to be selling chemicals used to make
meth. It will also increase the maximum criminal penalty for those
who possess equipment used to manufacture meth.

<p>

The second part of an effective meth-abuse prevention strategy
is to reduce demand through more effective education about the
drug's ruinous effects, which include hallucinations, addiction,
depression, paranoia and violent rages. This effort should be
spearheaded by private, non-profit groups involved in drug education
at both the national and grass-roots levels.

<p>

Finally, the strategy must include effective treatment. Treatment
funds must be controlled at the point of delivery where local
officials best understand the problem. These programs must last
long enough to give the addicts a fighting chance to recover,
and addicts must be held strictly accountable for their progress.

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

The methamphetamine epidemic is poised to become much worse than
the crack epidemic. Meth is cheaper, can be domestically produced
and gives the abuser a higher high that lasts much longer than
crack cocaine. Meth's downside is that it can make the abuser
incredibly violent, thus further fueling the nation's crime epidemic.
Now is the time for parents, school teachers, citizen groups,
law enforcement, government officials, church leaders and others
to act in concert to ward off this scourge before it accelerates
into overdrive, leaving millions of devastated citizens in its
wake.

<title>HOMOSEXUAL GROUP AIMS TO SILENCE OPPONENTS</title>

<h2>HOMOSEXUAL GROUP AIMS<br>
TO SILENCE OPPONENTS</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Robert Knight and Ken Ervin</i></center>

<p>

Under the guise of &quot;condemning hate speech,&quot; a homosexual
activist group, Parents, Friends &amp; Families of Lesbians And
Gays (PFLAG) has launched a TV and newspaper advertising campaign
designed to smear and silence opponents of the homosexual agenda.

<p>

Back when it was formed in 1981, the Washington, D.C.-based PFLAG
was a small, obscure group of parental activists. In recent years,
it has become a major player to promote homosexuality as normal
and healthy. PFLAG's mission statement focuses on three areas:

<p><ul>

<li>Support - chapter groups meet in various cities to offer support
and plan strategies;

<p>

<li>Advocacy - testifying and lobbying on both state and federal
levels in favor of homosexual-friendly legislation;

<p>

<li>Education - through the publishing of various &quot;fact&quot;
sheets, audio workshops, conferences and seminars.

</ul><p>

PFLAG's goal in educating society is to &quot;dispel myths, report
on scientific research, [and] explain religious teachings.&quot;[1]
However, the group has disseminated much inaccurate and misleading
information concerning homosexuality. For example, in its brochure
<I>Why Is My Child Gay?</I>, the reader is told that &quot;about
10 percent of the population is gay.&quot; This inflated figure
is based on the discredited works of Alfred Kinsey, author of
<I>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male</I>. The brochure also leads
the reader to believe that scientists have found evidence that
homosexuality is a biological predisposition, but no credible
evidence exists for this assertion.[2]

<p>

PFLAG has amassed considerable financial backing to launch its
latest campaign against opponents of the homosexual agenda. The
$1 million effort follows one of the many blueprints for propaganda
warfare set forth in the book <I>After the Ball: How America Will
Conquer Its Fear of Gays in the 90's</I>.[3]

<p>

PFLAG has chosen a tactic called &quot;Bracketing,&quot; which
is best described by <I>After the Ball</I> authors Marshall Kirk
and Hunter Madsen:

<p><blockquote>

<i>&quot;The best way to make homohatred look bad is to vilify those
who victimize gays. The public should be shown images of ranting 
homohaters whose associated traits and attitudes appall and anger 
Middle America. . . .In TV and print, images of victimizers
can be combined with those of their gay victims by a method propagandists
call 'bracket technique.' For example, for several seconds an unctuous
beady-eyed Southern preacher is shown pounding the pulpit in rage against
'those perverted, abominable creatures.' While his tirade continues over 
the soundtrack, the picture switches to heart-rending photos of badly 
beaten persons, or of gays who look decent, harmless, and likable; and 
then we cut back to the poisonous face of the preacher. The contrast 
speaks for itself. The viewer will ordinarily recoil from these images 
of victimizers, thinking automatically: 'I don't like those maniacs,
don't want to be like them, and would be ashamed if others thought I was 
like them. Surely I'm more compassionate and sophisticated, because I 
don't share their irrational hatred of gays.' Every time a viewer runs 
through this comparative self-appraisal, he reinforces a self-definition 
that consciously rejects homohatred and validates sympathy for gay 
victims. Exactly what we want.&quot;</i>[4]

</blockquote><p>

And apparently that is exactly what PFLAG wants, because they've
followed Kirk and Madsen's game plan almost to the letter.

<p><blockquote>

<i>&quot;One of the two 30-second [TV] spots dramatizes gay-bashing,
where a young man is chased by a group and then beaten; the other depicts 
a young woman holding a gun as she considers suicide. Visuals then cut 
to TV comments from the Rev. [Pat] Robertson, the Rev. Jerry Falwell 
and Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.).&quot;</i>[5]

</blockquote><p>

The PFLAG campaign, Project Open Mind, is expected to run for
the next two to five years. It is currently being marketed in
Houston, Atlanta, Washington, D.C., and Tulsa, Oklahoma. New stations
are being sought in five Midwest and Pacific Northwest markets.
The PFLAG effort coincides with a major effort to press the homosexual
agenda on several fronts:

<p><ul>

<li>Homosexuals in the military - the effort to force the inclusion
of open homosexuals in all branches of the U.S. military;

<p>

<li>Homosexual &quot;marriage&quot; - the campaign to accord marital
status to same-sex couples;

<p>

<li>Homosexual adoption - the drive to sanction custody and adoption
of children by same-sex couples;

<p>

<li>Civil rights for homosexuals - the wide-ranging campaign to
bully the U.S. legal system into granting special rights and privileges
to homosexuals on the grounds that homosexuals qualify for 
&quot;minority&quot; status.

</ul><p>

Coming under increasingly shrill attack from PFLAG and other homosexual
activist groups are orthodox Christianity and &quot;organized
religion.&quot; On this battleground, however, the homosexual
community seems fragmented over the best way to attack. One segment
of activists believes the best course of action is blatant, 
&quot;in-your-face&quot; defiance. This consists of staged, eye-catching 
media events like gay pride parades. During the June 25, 1995 New York 
City parade, activists, some in nun's habits and others in various 
stages of undress, once again marched past St. Patrick's Cathedral 
carrying signs with such slogans as &quot;Hatred is not sacred.&quot;

<p>

The belief of another faction is that this kind of activism has
damaged the homosexual cause politically and intellectually. During
the visit of Pope John Paul II to New York City, six men unfurled
a banner from a sixth-floor window in Saks Fifth Avenue facing
St. Patrick's Cathedral. The banner, which read &quot;Condoms
Save Lives,&quot; was removed and the men were arrested. Citing
this botched effort, lesbian writer Camille Paglia calls for homosexual
activists to turn from attacks on the church and concentrate more
on intellectual discourse. Yet the author, near the end of her
argument for a more intellectual approach, still can't resist
the urge to take pot-shots at religion:

<p><blockquote>

<i>&quot;Mottos I would have liked to see fly on violet satin over
St. Patrick's: Penis Power; Long Live Gay Love; Paradise Now; Sympathy 
for the Devil; Flesh and Fantasy; There Is No God; Eat of My Body; Sex 
Is Sacred; Art, Pleasure, Sex; Dionysus Lives; Bring Back Babylon; 
Pagans Unite; Disobey Authority; Free Your Mind.&quot;</i>[6]

</blockquote><p>

Another group has chosen to carry out its attacks by infiltrating
church hierarchy. Episcopal Bishop John Spong appeared as keynote
speaker at a November 10, 1995 symposium hosted by PFLAG and held
at Foundry United Methodist Church in Washington, D.C. (currently
attended by Bill and Hillary Clinton and, until early 1995, by
Bob and Elizabeth Dole). According to an eyewitness account by
Mark Tooley of the Institute on Religion and Democracy, Bishop
Spong's address ridiculed the Christmas story, praised homosexual
&quot;marriage,&quot; declared the Ten Commandments &quot;immoral,&quot;
and referred to the Apostle Paul as a &quot;self-hating, gay man.&quot;

<p>

Increasingly, opponents of the homosexual cause are being labeled
as &quot;bigots&quot; and &quot;haters&quot; by mainstream journalists.
For example, the <I>Washington Post</I>'s Richard Cohen recently
queried, &quot;Where is the Republican who will look certain conservative
Christians in the eye and call them the bigots they are? Where
are the Christian clergymen, like those of the civil rights era,
who will condemn ignorance and bigotry, and exalt tolerance and
understanding? Who in the GOP field will assert that homophobia
is not a family value?&quot;[7]

<p>

Even while homosexuals continue their media assault, few major
political figures dare to evince any criticism of the gay agenda.
Part of this is due to a wholesale media blitz. As syndicated
columnist Cal Thomas has remarked, &quot;Evidence of this compromise
is everywhere, from the open recruitment of 'gay journalists'
to a convention of the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Association
meeting in Washington last month. A copy of the program shows
that not only were representatives of major press organizations
in attendance as participants, they also contributed substantially
to the cost of the event.&quot;[8] These companies included ABC,
NBC, CBS, <I>The New York Times</I>, <I>USA Today</I> and the
Associated Press, which recruited homosexuals and openly sided
with the partisan homosexual agenda.

<p>

Homosexual activists have cultivated a relationship with the press
to such a degree that its ability to report fairly and objectively
on the issues has been seriously impaired. At one PFLAG meeting
in Maryland on Nov. 21, 1993, according to an eyewitness account
by Peter LaBarbera, homosexual researcher Dean Hamer told the
audience that he was pleased with media coverage. Hamer, a geneticist
with the National Cancer Institute who is under investigation
for fraud in connection with the first of two gay gene studies
he authored, said, &quot;If you tell the press what to write about
a scientific study, they'll write it.&quot;[9] He added that he told
reporters that his study's findings show that sexual orientation
is like being &quot;left-handed,&quot; and that they obliged him:
&quot;That's what I told them to say, and they said it.&quot;[10]

<p>

Liberal politicians are increasingly looking to groups like PFLAG
for support in their efforts to restructure and realign both government
and society. &quot;PFLAG is writing the final chapter in the
nation's 200-year-old struggle for civil rights. I don't know
if you realize how important you are,&quot; says Rep. Gerry Studds
(D-Mass.).[11]

<p>

PFLAG's campaign is by no means an arbitrary attack. It's just
one small piece of a much larger battle plan. The goal is to silence
all opponents of the homosexual agenda, and harness government
and corporate power to enforce it.

<title>PRISONER LAWSUITS: A TOOL FOR JUSTICE OR OBSTRUCTION?</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/insight/insight.gif">

<p>

<h2>PRISONER LAWSUITS:<br>
A TOOL FOR JUSTICE OR<br>
OBSTRUCTION?</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>

<p>

Lawsuits brought by prisoners cost Americans millions of dollars
and make a mockery of the justice system. One murderer sued more
than 300 times, claiming he caught a cold from eating off of paper
plates and wasn't given enough fruit juice. A serial killer on
California's death row who sexually assaulted, tortured and mutilated
five teenage girls, sued prison officials for &quot;cruel and
unusual punishment&quot; because they served him soggy sandwiches.
A Missouri rapist, robber and kidnapper sued to have prisoners
treated to salad bars and brunches on weekends and holidays.[1]

<p>

Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee,
is promoting an inmate lawsuit reform bill. In his words, &quot;It's
high time to stop this outrage against taxpayers. It must not
continue any longer.&quot;[2]

<p>

Lawmakers also want to halt inmate litigation which delays executions
and overturns state court decisions via federal habeas corpus
petitions. Reforming the federal habeas corpus review process
will help repair the sagging credibility of our criminal justice
system.

<p>

Our system is supposed to serve victims and criminals by ensuring
that offenders receive appropriate and swift punishments which
act as deterrence to future crime. Unfortunately, habeas corpus
petitions, which may be well intended, delay justice and therefore
damage law enforcement's credibility. This must change.

<p>

<center><h3>WHAT IS HABEAS CORPUS?</h3></center>

<p>

Habeas corpus petitions allege that the prisoner's federal constitutional
rights were violated. State and federal prisoners can challenge
the validity of their convictions and the appropriateness of their
sentences by filing these petitions in a federal court. If a federal
judge agrees, he can issue writs ordering the prisoner's freedom,
reducing his sentence or having his case remanded for retrial
or resentencing.

<p>

Habeas corpus is Latin for &quot;you have the body.&quot; It requires
the prison warden to produce a prisoner to determine whether or
not the inmate is imprisoned lawfully and whether or not he should
be released from custody. A state prisoner who has exhausted normal
state appeals may continue to litigate his conviction or sentence
by applying for habeas corpus in a federal district court.

<p>

A growing number of Americans view such appeals as judicial obstruction.
After all, in spite of overwhelming evidence, many are filed by
death row criminals who litigate solely to delay their execution.
For example:

<p><ul>

<li>In 1974, Mitchell Blazak was convicted and sentenced to death
on two counts of murder. Between 1977 and 1988 he filed five unsuccessful
petitions with Arizona courts. In 1988, he successfully persuaded
a federal district court to vacate his 1974 trial because it failed
to consider his mental competence at the time. Crucial evidence
was lost by the federal court during the habeas corpus evidentiary
hearing, and as a result the state could not retry him and settled
for a negotiated plea agreement. Because Blazak had his presentence
credit of more than 19 years, he was returned to prison for less
than six months and released.[3]

<p>

<li>In 1977, Clarence Allen was convicted and sentenced to life
in prison. From prison he arranged for the murder of three people
who testified against him for which he was then convicted and
sentenced to death. Six years later, the California Supreme Court
affirmed the death sentence. Over the next two years, his federal
habeas corpus petitions were denied, and the U.S. Supreme Court
declined to review his case. But on September 2, 1988 a sympathetic
federal district judge issued a stay of execution which remains
in effect today -- 22 years after his first murder.[4]

<p>

<li>William Bonin was convicted and sentenced to death for the
1979 murders of 14 boys he lured inside his van, sexually assaulted
and then strangled. After nearly two decades of delays, Bonin
and 31 other Orange County, California death-row inmates have
exhausted their appeals and are awaiting execution.[5]

<p>

<li>In 1982, Robert Buell kidnapped, brutally raped and strangled
an 11-year-old Ohio girl. He was found guilty and sentenced to
death. Over a period of 12 years, he filed eight separate judicial
actions involving 36 judges. He recently filed papers in federal
court seeking yet another hearing.[6]

</ul><p>

Although 77 percent of Americans favor the death penalty for murderers,
they don't want the system to act in undue haste and execute innocent
people who may have been wrongly convicted.[7] Thus, the courts and
legislative bodies have carefully crafted a system of checks and
balances which includes federal habeas corpus petitions. The system
has saved some innocent people from execution and from the effects
of judicial errors.

<p>

Lloyd Schlup was convicted and sentenced to death in 1985 for
helping to kill a fellow inmate in the Missouri State Penitentiary.
Schlup's jury didn't hear from the 20 prisoners who witnessed
the murder and who later testified that Schlup wasn't the killer.
Neither did they see a surveillance videotape that showed Schlup
elsewhere at the time of the murder. Finally, at the insistence
of Schlup's fifth court-appointed lawyer, the evidence was heard.
The federal judge, after seeing the evidence, said, &quot;No reasonable
juror would have convicted [Schlup] in light of the new evidence.&quot;[8]

<p>

Those opposed to habeas corpus reform such as the &quot;Emergency
Committee to Save Habeas Corpus&quot; often cite the case of Roger
Coleman. In 1981, Coleman was convicted and sentenced to death
for murdering and raping his sister-in-law although no one could
place him at the scene of the crime, and four independent witnesses
corroborated his near-perfect alibi. He was allegedly denied an
opportunity to present new evidence 10 years after sentencing
because his lawyer missed a filing date by three days. Coleman
was executed.[9]

<p>

The pro-reform Criminal Justice Legal Foundation (CJLF) provides
the rest of the story. Coleman's case went to the Supreme Court
twice on federal habeas corpus petitions. He claimed that new
evidence proved his innocence but in fact, according to a federal
judge, the forensic evidence done at Coleman's request &quot;significantly
bolster[ed] the jury's finding of guilt.&quot;[10]

<p>

Another case used to defend habeas corpus review involves Cornelius
Singleton, a black man, who was executed in Alabama in November,
1992, for murdering a nun in a cemetery by smothering her with
rocks. His court-appointed lawyer refused to meet with his client,
failed to object when the prosecutor struck all blacks from the
jury pool, and neglected to tell the jury that Singleton was mentally
retarded. The court-appointed attorney was disbarred. The attorney's
mistakes were wrong, but do not negate the facts in the case which
compelled a jury to find Singleton guilty of murder beyond a reasonable
doubt.[11]

<p>

<center><h3>HISTORY OF HABEAS CORPUS</h3></center>

<p>

Habeas corpus originated in Great Britain, where it was a 16th
century constitutional remedy against the tyranny of the crown.
It is found in Article 1, Section 9 of the U.S. Constitution:
&quot;The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be
suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public
safety may require it.&quot; Only once has the writ been suspended.
In 1861, during the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln did so
by proclamation.

<p>

Traditionally habeas corpus was a pre-trial remedy which guarded
against federal oppression. The right to habeas corpus under the
constitution and the Judiciary Act of 1789 limited federal government
power but didn't apply to those detained by the states.[12] The Act
gave federal courts authority to issue the writ only for federal
prisoners. In 1833, Congress made an exception for state prisoners
in cases where states were interfering with federal officers enforcing
the Fugitive Slave Act.[13]

<p>

In 1867, Congress created an enlarged statutory habeas corpus.
The intent was to help former slaves held in involuntary servitude
in violation of the 13th Amendment. This change permitted any
prisoner convicted in a state court to have the constitutionality
of his conviction or his sentence reviewed by federal courts.[14]

<p>

This change was not frequently used. For example, in 1941, state
prisoners filed 127 petitions in federal courts.[15] But after the
creation of a &quot;quasi-appellate federal habeas corpus jurisdiction
by judicial decisions of the 1950s and 1960s&quot; the number
of petitions increased dramatically.[16] In 1994, state prisoners
filed 11,918 such petitions.[17]

<p>

The 1953 Supreme Court case of <I>Brown v. Allen</I> transformed
federal habeas corpus into a general appellate jurisdiction of
the lower federal courts over criminal judgments.[18] The Court eliminated
conventional limitations on the scope of habeas review by expanding
the federal rights of state defendants.

<p>

Under Chief Justice William Rehnquist, the Supreme Court has since
imposed some limitations on writs of habeas corpus. It has narrowed
the range of claims that can be raised by prisoners who have pled
guilty. It has also restricted claims that were not properly raised
before state courts and barred rehearing of 4th Amendment claims
where state proceedings provide a &quot;full and fair opportunity&quot;
to litigate such claims.[19]

<p>

In a 1989 decision, the high court said that federal courts can't
consider habeas claims based on &quot;new rules of law&quot; that
were not in effect at the time of conviction.[20] A 1991 decision
further limits death row prisoners to one federal habeas petition
unless there is good reason why any constitutional claim was not
raised in the first instance.[21]

<p>

<center><h3>PROFILE OF THOSE WHO USE HABEAS CORPUS</h3></center>

<p>

Most of the 13,359 federal and state inmates who filed federal
habeas corpus petitions in 1994 had been convicted of serious,
violent offenses. A 1987 U.S. Attorney General study found that
40 percent were filed five years after conviction, and delays
of more than 50 years were found.[22]

<p>

Anti-reform advocates like Yale Law School scholar Libby Lewis
cite myths to defend habeas corpus review. Lewis wrote in <I>The
Baltimore Sun</I>, &quot;Federal courts have found reversible
constitutional error in 40 percent of the death-penalty cases
reviewed under habeas corpus since 1976 -- after state courts
found no such error.&quot;[23]

<p>

A comprehensive analysis of federal habeas corpus reviews in capital
cases by the pro-reform CJLF labels Lewis's 40 percent statistic
&quot;out of date.&quot; The Foundation says the overall number
is around 15 percent, and for guilty verdicts the rate is only
5 percent.[24]

<p>

The Justice Department's 1995 review of federal habeas corpus
cases provides an interesting profile. It found that four of five
habeas petitioners had been convicted after trial and had their
cases reviewed by state appellate courts. Nearly half pursued
collateral remedies in state courts, and a third had filed at
least one previous federal petition.[25]

<p>

The Justice Department found that one-quarter of petitioners allege
ineffective assistance of counsel. Others cite trial court errors,
prosecutorial misconduct and violations of the 4th, 5th, 6th,
8th and 14th Amendments.[26] Roughly one-third of the petitions address
a single issue and more than 10 percent cite four or more issues.[27]

<p>

Federal courts dispose of most habeas cases quickly. Almost all
cases (98 percent) are either dismissed or denied on the merits,
while 1 percent are granted on the merits, leaving only 1 percent
to be returned to state courts for follow-up action.[28] Almost two-thirds
are dismissed due to either plaintiff's failure to exhaust state
remedies or procedural errors. Three of every four cases are settled
in about a year, but one out of every 10 cases lasts longer than
two years.[29]

<p>

Of course, the more issues involved, the longer the case. Multiple-issue
petitions average about 925 days to resolve while single-issue
cases are resolved in 224 days. The type of issue also dictates
the length of the period for resolution. For example, petitions
which allege prosecutorial misconduct take on the average 608
days, and trial court error issues take 559 days.[30]

<p>

On December 31, 1994, the Justice Department found there were
2,890 prisoners under sentence of death. During the period from
1977 to 1994, a total of 4,557 persons entered state and federal
prisons under sentences of death, and 1,790 of them have been
removed as a result of resentencing, retrial, commutation or death
while awaiting execution.[31]

<p>

In 1989, CJLF studied 100 capital habeas corpus cases from the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. It found that
40 percent of the court's final judgments resulted in relief.
Anti-reform advocates use this as evidence that habeas reviews
identify systemic deficiencies in state courts. But on closer
examination of each case, the states reached a reasonable decision.
The cases that gained federal relief came because the law had
changed, the claim was never properly presented to the state courts,
or because the courts simply disagreed with state jurists.[32]

<p>

A 1994 study by the National Center for State Courts came to a
similar conclusion. It found that the success rate for capital
habeas petitioners was &quot;vastly overstated.&quot; It found
that federal courts gave relief in 15 percent of capital cases
examined.[33]

<p>

<center><h3>WHY NOT CHANGE HABEAS CORPUS REVIEW?</h3></center>

<p>

Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote in 1992 that there
is no case in which &quot;a state court's incorrect legal determination
has ever been allowed to stand because it was reasonable. . .
. We have always held that federal courts, even on habeas, have
an independent obligation to say what the law is.&quot;[34]

<p>

Habeas provides a mechanism to protect a criminal's constitutional
rights from abusive state courts. In 1982, a police officer in
Houston, Texas was gunned down during a routine traffic stop.
Police killed one of the assailants and charged the other with
the officer's murder. A jury convicted the man and sentenced him
to death. Texas denied him a rehearing. The man, an illegal alien,
filed a habeas petition. The federal judge found that prosecutors
had threatened witnesses, failed to disclose evidence that showed
the man's innocence and used false evidence at trial. The man's
life was saved.[35]

<p>

Hugo Bedau, a professor at Tufts University and an authority on
the death penalty, defends habeas, saying, &quot;It's absolutely
critical if we're going to have a death penalty system that we
provide adequate safeguards lest we make an irreversible, catastrophic
mistake. And we know that mistakes are constantly made.&quot;[36]

<p>

Leigh Dingerson, with the National Coalition to Abolish the Death
Penalty, also defends habeas corpus petitions. The &quot;real&quot;
implication of the habeas reform effort, according to Dingerson,
is that &quot;we'll see cases with significant constitutional
error slide through the courts without review. . . . Most death
row inmates were very poorly represented by trial counsel. . .
. So the more we limit the appeals process, the more we risk executing
defendants simply because they had a lousy lawyer.&quot;[37]

<p>

&quot;Without a review process conducted by a federal judge sitting
for life,&quot; said Michael Knoll, head of the Death Penalty
Information Center, &quot;you are going to see a lot more errors
go through -- errors that will lead to executions.&quot;[38]

<p>

Those opposed to habeas reform explain that state judges, who
may be elected [this is true in seven of the 50 states], and who
sometimes are former prosecutors, are subject to local political
pressures which could influence their trial decisions. This is
why federal courts are run by judges who are appointed for life
and are immune to many of the same pressures.

<p>

Former Florida Supreme Court Chief Justice Arthur England supports
federal review of state decisions. &quot;We've had instances in
Florida where innocent people came very close to being executed,&quot;
but they were saved by federal review.[39]

<p>

Former president of the American Bar Association, John Curtin,
Jr., supports habeas review of state decisions. &quot;Miscarriages
of justice cannot be tolerated in a civilized society.&quot;[40] Habeas
review acts as a responsible check on the system.

<p>

<center><h3>WHY CHANGE HABEAS CORPUS REVIEW?</h3></center>

<p>

Jerri Davis, whose son was viciously murdered in 1979 by a killer
who has delayed his execution for 17 years, argues, &quot;As long
as he's sitting up there, there's resentment. He has his life.
He has his card games, his exercise, his TV. We're feeding him.
We're clothing him. It's not fair.&quot;[41]

<p>

Death-row inmates like the killer of Davis's son have manipulated
the courts. They have nothing to lose, and the taxpayer picks
up the tab. Even Justice O'Connor cautions federal courts to be
&quot;fair to the states, in not disrupting the states' enforcement
of their criminal laws.&quot;[42]

<p>

&quot;There are some crimes that are so brutal that society expects
and demands the death penalty,&quot; says Michael Capizzi, an
Orange County, California district attorney. &quot;If you take
a quick snapshot of the devastation to human beings you understand
why an overwhelming majority of the people in the state favor
the death penalty.&quot;[43]

<p>

An ABA report shows that even the simplest cases, where relief
is denied at every stage, will still go to the high court at least
three times and to federal district and appellate courts twice.
That's after all state-level options are exhausted.[44]

<p>

Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia has criticized the death
penalty appeals process. &quot;The state has, as noted, a strong
interest in executing its duly acquired judgment.&quot; Referring
to a convicted murderer who has delayed his execution via the
appeals process for 15 years, he says his &quot;interest . . .is
entirely indeterminate, and for all we know non-existent. He seeks
additional time not in order to elaborate on a known claim, but
in order to develop a claim.&quot; Judge Scalia fears that the
current process allows executions to be &quot;stayed 
indefinitely.&quot;[45]

<p>

Paul Kamenar, director of the Washington Legal Foundation, says
that reforming habeas corpus and the 1976 revival of the death
penalty will improve criminal justice. But he warns, &quot;The
deterrent effect of any punishment depends on how swiftly the
punishment is applied.&quot;[46] Given the long delays for appeals
between sentencing and execution, many citizens have grown disillusioned
with the justice system.

<p>

Rep. Bill McCollum (R-Fla.), chairman of the House Judiciary Crime
Subcommittee, wants to limit habeas corpus appeals. &quot;It sends
the message of swiftness and certainty of punishment that has
been missing from our criminal justice system for some time, and
it goes a long way to restoring deterrence to the criminal justice
system.&quot;[47]

<p>

Rep. Steve Chabot (R-Ohio) supports changing the appeals process
&quot;because of the length of time that people remain on death
row at taxpayer expense. The people in this country are sick and
tired of paying for cable TV and . . . for food and lawyers for
those who have killed innocent people.&quot;[48]

<p>

John Collins, with the Springfield, Va., Citizens for Law and
Order, expresses a widely held belief that &quot;with repeated
review, there's never any finality, and there is continued victimization
of families.&quot; He asked, &quot;If you have federal review
after you've had full and fair state court consideration, why
have the state courts at all?&quot;[49]

<p>

Reform advocates contend that death-row inmates intentionally
withhold claims and wait until the last minute to petition federal
courts to gain execution delays. William Kopney, an Orange County
appellate attorney, said, &quot;Don't underestimate the ingenuity
of the people who are struggling 24 hours a day to save someone's
life when they believe the trial wasn't fair, or there's a miscarriage
of justice . . . . It's common for 11th-hour requests to strike
some responsive chord.&quot;[50]

<p>

<center><h3>LEGISLATION TO REFORM HABEAS CORPUS</h3></center>

<p>

Many Americans want Congress to do something to reverse what they
perceive to be the abuse of the justice system by inmates. Americans
are also cynical about a liberal judiciary that appears to place
criminals' rights before victims' rights.

<p>

That's the impetus for legislative action to curb habeas corpus
abuse. In 1983, then-Attorney General William French Smith suggested
enactment of legislation abolishing federal habeas corpus as a
post-conviction remedy for state inmates.[51] Although Attorney General
Edwin Meese III agreed, Congress failed to act.[52] More recent attorneys
general echo agreement.

<p>

Following the April, 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, President Clinton
called for &quot;swift justice&quot; and gave his support to an
anti-terrorism bill. In both the Senate and House versions, that
bill includes habeas corpus reform.

<p>

The Senate version (S. 735, &quot;Comprehensive Terrorism Act
of 1995&quot;) requires that a prisoner show that his conviction
or sentence violated &quot;clearly established federal law, as
determined by the Supreme Court of the U.S.&quot;[53]

<p>

The House version (H.R. 2703, &quot;The Effective Death Penalty
and Public Safety Act&quot;) incorporates habeas corpus reform
that establishes a six-month statute of limitations during which
a prisoner must file paperwork to receive an appeal hearing in
capital offense cases. Non-capital defendants have one year in
which to file appeal paperwork. Once the appeal has been filed,
the federal court must hear the case within four months. If the
petitioner loses at the district court, he may appeal only if:
(1) newly discovered evidence demonstrates clearly and convincingly
that no reasonable fact-finder would have found the defendant
guilty in his original trial, and (2) a new rule of constitutional
law, made retroactive by the Supreme Court, is issued which was
previously unavailable.

<p>

Officials at the Office of Management and Budget criticize the
proposed changes. In their view, the proposed reform will &quot;subject
[the law] to potentially meritorious constitutional challenge.&quot;[54]
OMB says the proposal presumes to instruct federal courts on the
decisions those courts should reach on the meaning of the Constitution.

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

The battle over habeas corpus reform will become a constitutional
confrontation between the judiciary and the legislature. Congress
can make law, but the high court has sway over issues of constitutionality.

<p>

The issue of protracted appeals by convicted criminals touches
deep emotions, especially among victims and their families. It
costs taxpayers millions of dollars to support inmate litigation
and sustain the judicial system. While appeals are in process
the friends and family of the victims suffer because they believe
justice has not been served. After almost every execution, the
victim's family says something to the effect of, &quot;At least
I can rest. Justice has been served.&quot;

<p>

It's time for habeas corpus reform that balances constitutional
rights and ensures justice. Any change must equally address three
tenets: swift punishment means better deterrence; limitless and
meritless appeals deny justice and displace taxpayer funds from
other programs; and hasty punishment may result in injustice to
those wrongly convicted.

<p>

Americans want to protect civil liberties, but they also want
to avoid freeing violent criminals on technicalities while ensuring
that police officers do not abuse their authority. Striking
this delicate balance is the subject of a national debate that
centers on the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution.

<p>

The Fourth Amendment guarantees &quot;[t]he right of the people
to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects, against
unreasonable searches and seizures[.]&quot;  To protect this right,
the modern judiciary created the exclusionary rule, which says
that prosecutors may not use evidence gathered illegally by the
police.  The rule is intended to keep law enforcement honest.

<p>

Policemen must obtain a warrant prior to searching and seizing.
Otherwise, evidence obtained at a crime scene may be ruled inadmissible
in court.  Judges routinely exclude such &quot;illegally&quot;
obtained evidence and allow criminals to go free. For example:

<p><ul>

<li>Charles Rathbun was arrested for the November 1995 murder
of model Linda Sobek.  He allegedly took Sobek into the California
hills, where he murdered her and buried her body.  During questioning,
Rathbun confessed to the crime and led officials to Sobek's grave.
A California court, however, ruled Rathbun's confession inadmissible
because police had not read him his rights prior to questioning.[1]
He may go free.

<p>

<li>Gary Gauger confessed to the gruesome murder of his parents
in 1993.  He was convicted and sentenced to death.  On appeal,
an Illinois court ruled that his confession was inadmissible because
it, too, was illegally obtained.[2] He may go free.

<p>

<li>In 1984, Alfio Ferro was arrested for a fur robbery and murder.
While in custody, Ferro refused to speak with police.  One of
the detectives laid some furs in front of Ferro's cell.  Ferro,
thinking the police had information about the crime, made statements
which were later used against him.  A New York appeals court overturned
his murder conviction, contending that the placing of furs in
front of Ferro's cell amounted to coercion.  Ferro was freed.[3]

</ul><p>

Pending legislation which will alter the exclusionary rule might
have kept these murderers behind bars.

<p>

<center><h3>GROWING NATIONAL INTOLERANCE FOR LEGAL ABUSES</h3></center>

<p>

According to Steven Wagner of Luntz Research, a Republican polling
firm, there is a widespread feeling that the criminal justice
system has broken down and that the breakdown is &quot;the most
visible symbol of the declining moral character of American 
society.&quot;[4] Consider evidence of a wayward justice system.

<p>

In January 1996, at 5 a.m., a New York police officer patrolling
a high-crime area saw four young men loading duffel bags into
the trunk of an out-of-state car.  The men fled when they saw
the officer.  The officer found $4 million worth of cocaine and
heroin in the bags.[5]

<p>

Initially, federal District Court Judge Harold Baer found the
officer's explanation &quot;incredible&quot; and threw out the
trafficker's videotaped confession, saying the arrested driver
could have been an innocent visitor getting help with her luggage.[6]
He denied that the police had &quot;probable cause&quot; for
searching the car.  The judge also said the men fled because of
the police department's reputation for being brutal.  Only after
a buildup of political pressure (including from President Clinton,
who had appointed the judge) did Baer reverse the finding.[7]

<p>

House Speaker Newt Gingrich called on President Clinton to admit
he had made mistakes in appointing judges &quot;who find technicalities
to release drug dealers and dangerous criminals.&quot;[8] Others
accused Baer of favoring the rights of criminals over public safety.

<p>

Nevertheless, it is not difficult to see why some Americans are
suspicious of law enforcement.  Tales of police corruption, rogue
cops and evidence &quot;planting&quot; fill the media.  Testimony
in the O.J. Simpson murder trial by former Los Angeles detective
Mark Fuhrman eroded confidence in all policemen.  Fuhrman gave
the country a startling example of police brutality and racism.
Fuhrman bragged on tape about police abuses:  &quot;We basically
tortured them. . . .We broke'em.  Their faces were just mush.&quot;[9]

<p>

The widely-publicized Rodney King beating and the recent videotape
of two white deputies clubbing Mexicans near Los Angeles have
revived fears of rogue cops.  The &quot;Good Ol' Boys Roundup&quot;
in eastern Tennessee, where law enforcement agents took part in
racist acts, also add to the public's negative perception of law
enforcement.

<p>

Although these scenes do not represent the hundreds of thousands
of law enforcement officers who do their job well and faithfully
every day, they have undermined public confidence in the justice
and law enforcement systems and have chilled the exclusionary
rule debate.  Americans are confused about calls to reform the
rule.  Should lawmakers leave the rule alone or give police more
authority? Both options have liabilities.

<p>

<center><h3>THE EXCLUSIONARY RULE IN HISTORY</h3></center>

<p>

The exclusionary rule was created by the courts to implement the
Fourth Amendment.  It dates back to colonial times when British
troops broke down doors of homes seeking criminal evidence.  The
framers of America's Bill of Rights had one specific incident
in mind.

<p>

The 1763 case of <I>Wilkes v. Wood</I> clearly illustrates the
need for the Fourth Amendment. British troops, acting without
a warrant, broke into Wilkes' home and seized his private diaries.
Wilkes won his damage action against the colonial government.
His case steeled the Constitution's framers with a desire to
preclude future abuses.

<p>

Although the Fourth Amendment of the Bill of Rights guarantees
to all persons the right to be secure from &quot;unreasonable&quot;
searches and seizures, it does not specify a remedy for violations
of this protection.  This is where the Supreme Court has sought
clarity.

<p>

In the 1820s, an attorney argued before the high court that the
Constitution provided for the exclusion of evidence.  Supreme
Court Justice Joseph Story denied that the Bill of Rights included
the concept of excluding evidence.  Story wrote, &quot;The right
of using evidence does not depend, nor, as far as I have any recollection,
has ever been supposed to depend, upon the lawfulness or unlawfulness
of the mode by which it is obtained.&quot;[10]

<p>

In 1886, however, the high court took the first steps toward creating
the modern exclusionary rule.  In <I>Boyd v. United States</I>,
the Supreme Court decided that using a man's diary or personal
papers as evidence against him in a criminal case would force
him &quot;to be a witness against himself.&quot;[11] Under these
circumstances, the court opined, the use of such evidence could
be denied.

<p>

In 1914, the exclusionary rule was officially created by the <I>Weeks
v. United States</I> decision. The high court determined that
evidence seized illegally had to be excluded.   The court reasoned
that the temptation to make unlawful searches and seizures could
not be checked by the threat of a civil lawsuit alone, and that
forcing law enforcement officials to get proper warrants would
force them to act with restraint. The court also reasoned that
denying police the fruits of unrestrained searches was an appropriate
defense of civil liberties.

<p>

As in the 1949 <I>Wolf v. Colorado</I> case, the high court resisted
forcing the rule on state courts. But in 1961, Chief Justice
Earl Warren led the Supreme Court in <I>Mapp v. Ohio</I> to expand
the rule's application to all jurisdictions.  In 1984, it was
modified with <I>Leon v. United States</I>. In this case police
conducted a search pursuant to a search warrant that later was
found to have been defective.  The Supreme Court said that because
the officers believed they were acting properly, denying the evidence
would not deter future misconduct.  This has become known as the
&quot;good-faith&quot; exception.

<p>

The &quot;good-faith&quot; exception has also been applied in
situations where police gathered evidence without a search warrant
but in the reasonable belief that their actions were proper.

<p>

Now that the exclusionary rule has been tried for 80 years, it
has earned both supporters and detractors.  Professor William
Gangi of St. John's University told the Senate Judiciary Committee,
&quot;I see Americans growing increasingly cynical about our criminal
justice system, making derogatory references to 'technicalities'
or to criminals having more rights than their victims. And we
have to ask ourselves, 'Why?'&quot;[12]

<p>

<center><h3>HANDS-OFF THE RULE</h3></center>

<p>

Defenders of the exclusionary rule claim it keeps lawmen honest.

<p>

Alan Dershowtiz, Harvard law professor and civil liberties advocate,
cautions that expanding the defendant's rights using the exclusionary
rule is the best way to protect the public from police abuses.[13]

<p>

James Fyfe, a former New York policeman and specialist on police
behavior, warns that &quot;...like some soldiers in a no-win war,
they [policemen] commit atrocities.&quot;[14]

<p>

This warning is not without substance.  The 1994 New York City
Mollen Commission investigated police corruption.  It found the
Department plagued with misconduct.  The Commission also found
that the Department's internal affairs &quot;often minimized and
even concealed corruption rather than rooted it out.&quot;  In
March 1994, 50 cops were arrested on charges of drug trafficking,
extortion, brutality and civil rights violations.[15]

<p>

Recently, Philadelphia had a similar police scandal.  Six rogue
cops pleaded guilty to charges that they framed people, lied to
obtain search warrants and stole money.  At least 42 criminal
convictions have been overturned as a result of these disclosures.[16]

<p>

Some key members of Congress support the exclusionary rule as
a check on police corruption.  On March 7, 1995, Senator Edward
Kennedy (D-Mass.) told the Senate Judiciary Committee, &quot;The
exclusionary rule enforces the Fourth Amendment by providing a
powerful disincentive to illegal searches by law enforcement
officials. . . .The rule has given prosecutors' offices and police
departments an institutional stake in thorough, lawful police
work.&quot;[17] Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.) and Rep. Bobby
Rush (D-Ill.) both claim to have been victimized by warrantless
federal searches.[18]

<p>

The American Bar Association also supports the rule.  Michael
McCann, an elected district attorney of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin,
spoke for the ABA at the same Senate Judiciary crime control hearing.
&quot;The rule has worked. . . .It has contributed to substantial
law reform by federal authorities.  It has increased the professionalism
of federal law enforcement officers.  It has vastly enhanced the
integrity of the federal judicial process.&quot;[19]

<p>

Rule supporters point out that complaints of abuse are often unfounded.
They cite four studies that show that the rule is seldom used
to toss out evidence.  A 1979 General Accounting Office report
found that motions to suppress evidence were granted in only 1.3
percent of federal cases.  A 1982 National Institute of Justice
study found that only 0.79 percent of all California felony cases
between 1976-79 rejected evidence because of the rule.  A study
of three midwestern states found the rule was used in less than
half of 1 percent of all cases.  Finally, Professor Wayne LaFave of the
University of Illinois College of Law found, &quot;The most careful
and balanced assessment of all available empirical data show [sic]
that. . .the cumulative loss in felony cases because of prosecutor
screening, police releases and court dismissals attributable to
the acquisition of evidence in violation of the Fourth Amendment
is from 0.6 percent to 2.35 percent.&quot;[20]

<p>

Even some peace officers support the rule.  Myron Orfield Jr.,
writing in the <I>University of Chicago Law Review</I>, quotes
the head of the narcotics section of the Organized Crime Division
of the Chicago Police Department:  &quot;In my personal opinion
[the exclusionary rule] is not a detriment to police work.  In
fact, the opposite is true.  It makes the police department more
professional.&quot;[21]

<p>

FBI director Louis Freeh said, &quot;My sense and my experience
have been that over the years, the exclusionary rule has not been
an obstacle to the FBI.&quot;[22]

<p>

John Dawes, a Cobb County, Georgia, homicide detective said, &quot;It's
been my experience that it's better to have a legal search warrant
issued by a judge.  That way, when you're entering, you know that
you're legally entering and legally gathering evidence.&quot;[23]

<p>

Justice Louis Brandeis endorsed placing constraints on law enforcers.
He wrote for the high court in the 1928 case <I>Olmstead v. United
States</I>: &quot;Our government is the potent, the omnipresent
teacher.  For good or for ill, it teaches the whole people by
its example. . . .If the government becomes a lawbreaker, it breeds
contempt for law; it invites every man to become a law unto himself;
it invites anarchy.&quot;[24]

<p>

Harvard law professor Carol Steiker echoed Brandeis's views to
the Senate Judiciary Committee at the March 7, 1995 hearing. 
She traced the expansion in the size and strength of our modern
police forces and said, &quot;Today's citizens are much more likely
to face well-trained and well-equipped police than they are to
encounter the anonymous blundering constable [who was once blamed
for making illegal searches]. . . .&quot;  She argues that modern
police are &quot;measured not by fidelity to procedural niceties
but rather by their ability to ferret out as much crime as possible.
In this respect, the Fourth Amendment's warrant clause and the
exclusionary rule are eminently realistic constitutional commands:
each counterbalances the natural incentive to fight crime at
any cost.&quot;[25]

<p>

She cited Justice Brandeis: &quot;To declare that in the administration
of the criminal law the end justifies the means -- to declare
that the government would commit crimes in order to secure the
conviction of a private criminal -- would bring terrible 
retribution.&quot;[26]

<p>

Steiker says the exclusionary rule protects the most vulnerable
citizens from police over-reaching.  Specifically, she contends,
racial minorities are discriminated against by law enforcement
because too often race and class act as proxies for criminality
and too often police subject minority communities to the most
intrusive and offensive law enforcement tactics.[27]

<p>

She further argues that the rule encourages prosecutors and law
enforcement to communicate during the early stages of investigations
so as to develop evidence that can be used in court. Finally,
Steiker believes it protects the judicial process by preventing
government from being implicated in legitimizing unlawful conduct.[28]

<p>

<center><h3>CHANGE THE EXCLUSIONARY RULE</h3></center>

<p>

On the other hand, Senator Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), chairman of the
Senate Judiciary Committee, disputes the notion that the exclusionary
rule deters police misconduct.  He argues that there is &quot;little
reliable empirical evidence that police misconduct has been deterred
by the rule.&quot;[29]

<p>

Judge Harold Rothwax, former vice chairman of the New York Civil
Liberties Union during the 1960s says, &quot;The pendulum has
now swung to the point that it unfairly favors the defendant 
[criminal].&quot;[30]

<p>

Judge Rothwax warns, &quot;What's happened is we've really departed
from common sense. . . . The system today seems incomprehensible to 
the average citizen.&quot;[31]

<p>

Steven Brill, editor-in-chief of <I>Court TV</I> and <I>The American
Lawyer</I>, agrees. &quot;There's no doubt that lots and lots
of people of good faith -- who aren't anti-civil liberties and
aren't right-wing zealots -- are increasingly frustrated.&quot;[32]

<p>

Professor Gangi told the Senate Judiciary Committee, &quot;I call
it a disgrace.  Not only has the exclusionary rule failed to work
the magic its proponents promised, but it has eroded citizen confidence
in the competency of government.  And, in my opinion, it also
has thoroughly undermined the nobility of the role once played
by defense counsel.&quot;[33]

<p>

Paul Robinson, a professor at Northwestern University School of
Law, writes in <I>The Atlantic Monthly</I>, &quot;The exclusionary
rule...suggests a system less strongly committed to doing justice
than to discouraging overreaching by the police.&quot;  He suggests
that police misconduct can be controlled by making offending officers
liable or by helping victims to get compensation from municipalities.
He says, &quot;If limiting overreaching by the police is such
an important goal, why not attack it head-on rather than 'punishing'
the offending officers by letting the criminal go free -- which
punishes society rather than the officers?&quot;[34]

<p>

<center><h3>PENDING LEGISLATION WOULD CHANGE THE RULE</h3></center>

<p>

The Exclusionary Rule Reform Act of 1995 (H.R. 666) would expand
the so-called &quot;good-faith&quot; exception to certain federal
searches without a warrant.  Evidence would be admissible as long
as trial judges determine that police had reason to believe that
their actions were proper.  The bill would not overturn prior
Supreme Court decisions specifying when a warrant must be obtained
prior to conducting a search.

<p>

Professor Steiker admits that this bill would not eliminate the
exclusionary rule but proposes it would admit unconstitutionally
seized evidence when law enforcement agents have a belief in the
legitimacy of their conduct.  She argues that this change ignores
the importance of the rule in the maintenance of judicial integrity
and fails to provide equally effective deterrence of unconstitutional
conduct. Further, she believes it will encourage police overreaching.[35]

<p>

Thomas Davies, professor at the University of Tennessee College
of Law, agrees with Steiker.  He believes H.R. 666 would provide
short-term gains, &quot;but the rule plays a vital role in reaffirming
the rule of law.  [The exclusionary rule and Mirander Waiver rules]
tell police officers that citizen's rights matter.  They allow
honest police officers to respect themselves as upstanding citizens
also.&quot;[36]

<p>

Senator Hatch's legislation, The Violent Crime Control and Law
Enforcement Improvement Act of 1995 (S.3), would eliminate the
rule entirely and establish in its place a civil tort remedy designed
to benefit citizens whose Fourth Amendment rights have been violated.

<p>

Hatch argues, the &quot;rule is not compelled by the Constitution.
. . .It is time to revisit this judicially-created remedy.&quot;[37]
He wants to strike the delicate balance between protecting the
rights of the accused from police misconduct while ensuring that
relevant evidence comes before the jury -- so as to put the truly
guilty in jail and achieve justice.
Akhil Reed Amar, a professor at Yale Law School, told the Senate
Judiciary Committee  that the Hatch bill &quot;restores coherence
to our constitutional structure.  It takes the Fourth Amendment
out of criminal procedure, where it does not fit, and puts it
back where it belongs: in constitutional law.&quot;[38] He also
said, &quot;Suppose the bill increases convictions of guilty defendants
by 1 percent.  That's a lot of guilty rapists, murderers, and
robbers, and a lot of victims of crime who can sleep easier.&quot;[39]

<p>

The Hatch bill is not without its opponents.  Senator Kennedy
said that enactment of the Hatch bill &quot;would invite drastically
reduced compliance with the Constitution.&quot;[40]

<p>

Professor Steiker believes that removing the rule would fail to
provide the required deterrent effect and that the tort alternative
is misdirected.  Victims of illegal searches would not bring suit
against police misconduct either because lawyers would be reluctant
to take such cases or the likely awards would be insufficiently
enticing.[41]

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

There are competing concepts in the exclusionary rule debate 
-- freedom from police misconduct and justice for the guilty.
We must find a balance.

<p>

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. wrote from his Birmingham, Alabama
jail cell, &quot;Freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor,
it must be demanded by the oppressed.&quot;[42] Most citizens would
agree with Dr. King.

<p>

Today, there is ample evidence that some lawmen and judges are
over-stepping their bounds.  This must change.  Congress should
modify the law to simultaneously deny freedom to the guilty, give
incentives for police professionalism and protect civil liberties.
It can start by changing the court-created exclusionary rule.

<h2>MARY JANE IS NO FLORENCE<br>
NIGHTINGALE: THE TRUTH<br>
ABOUT MARIJUANA'S<br>
MEDICINAL USES</h2>

<p>

If a bill before the House makes its way into law, the federal
government would have to make the switch from uprooting and destroying
marijuana crops to growing its own fields of plants for large-scale
distribution.

<p>

Once again, pro-drug groups are trying to convince America that
marijuana must be considered a legitimate medicine. Rep. Barney
Frank (D-Mass.) introduced H.R. 2618 last November, which would
&quot;provide for the therapeutic use of marijuana in situations
involving life-threatening or sense-threatening illnesses and
to provide adequate supplies of marijuana for such use.&quot;[1]

<p>

The specified illnesses are to be limited to glaucoma, AIDS wasting
syndrome, nausea resulting from chemotherapy, and spasticity resulting
from multiple sclerosis (MS), paraplegia, and quadriplegia. However,
the bill does leave room for those with other illnesses to apply
for marijuana use through the Food and Drug Administration.[2]

<p>

Basically, the bill is another effort to reclassify marijuana.
Currently, marijuana is under Schedule I, meaning it is unable
to be prescribed, has a high potential for abuse, is not currently
accepted for medicinal use, and has a lack of safety. Rescheduling
marijuana would place it under Schedule II, which includes drugs
currently accepted for medical use that have a high potential
for abuse, but are still able to be prescribed.[3] Cocaine is an
example of a Schedule II drug.

<p>

The bill calls for an Office for the Supply of Internationally
Controlled Drugs to be established under the Department of Health
and Human Services. That office would be responsible for making
sure there is an adequate supply of the drug for &quot;legitimate
medical, research, scientific, and export needs of the United
States.&quot; This supply would come from bidders or, if there
weren't enough domestic growers, from direct importation.

<p>

The office would provide the seeds to those whose bids to grow
marijuana are accepted. Those seeds, in turn, would be obtained
as follows: &quot;[L]egitimate commercial producers of marijuana
or, if this is not feasible, the National Institute on Drug Abuse,
the Attorney General through the Drug Enforcement Administration,
or the Secretary of Agriculture shall provide the Secretary with
an adequate supply of seeds capable of germination.&quot;

<p>

The marijuana would be distributed to doctors who have said they
intend to use the drug only on consenting patients with one of
the aforementioned illnesses. The doctors would be approved by
sending in applications which the office would approve or deny
within 30 days. According to the bill, if the office does not
respond within that time, doctors could consider themselves approved.

<p>

The use of marijuana as medicine has stirred considerable controversy.
Marijuana advocates insist it carries valuable medical benefits
and claim it is actually more harmful to prohibit the sick from
smoking it. Most of the medical community sees it differently,
however. Few doubt that marijuana (cannabis) does have a certain
degree of medical effect. The problem is the marked disadvantages
crude marijuana carries with it. Smoked marijuana has too many
negative side-effects to warrant its use as a drug.

<p>

Of course, the utility of marijuana as a true medicine too often
takes a back seat to other interests. The pro-marijuana movement,
led by the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws
(NORML) and the Drug Policy Foundation (DPF), certainly has a
well-known ulterior motive for pushing marijuana as a medicine.
Dr. Janet Lapey, a pathologist who is now president of Concerned
Citizens for Drug Prevention, said members of NORML have frequently
cited the medicinal marijuana issue as a red herring to gain a
toehold in legalizing all marijuana use.[4] (In fact, the pro-drug
<I>High Times</I> magazine characterized drug proposals like 
marijuana-as-medicine as being mere first steps that were &quot;far 
short of the DPF's ultimate goals, which include decriminalization of 
all illegal drugs.&quot;[5])

<p>

Marijuana simply is not the equal of other therapeutic drugs already
on the market. In fact, the American Medical Association, the
American Glaucoma Society, the American Academy of Ophthalmology,
the American Cancer Society, and the National Multiple Sclerosis
Society all deny that marijuana should be construed as medicine.[6]
After the DEA reviewed a petition for the possible rescheduling
of marijuana, Robert Bonner, the Administrator of Drug Enforcement
at the time, wrote, &quot;Relying on the same scientific standards
used to judge all other drugs, FDA experts repeatedly have rejected
marijuana for medical use.&quot;[7]

<p>

The active medical and psychoactive ingredient in marijuana is
delta-nine tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). A synthetic THC called
dronabinol has been marketed as the drug Marinol since 1985.[8] Thus,
what medical good there is in marijuana has already been separated
from the problematic vegetable tissue of the cannabis plant. However,
even this purified and tested drug is not well received because
of its serious side-effects. Dr. Eric A.Voth is an assistant professor
of medicine at the University of Kansas and chairman of the International
Drug Strategy Institute. He has treated drug addicts for 10 years,
and recently testified at a congressional hearing on the legalization
of marijuana. Voth asserts, &quot;The negative side-effect profile
for marijuana, even dronabinol (Marinol), far exceeds most of
the other effective agents available.&quot;[9] Voth backs this assertion
by citing a study which ranked non-inhalant THC as only sixth
in preference among oncologists for the treatment of severe nausea,
and only ninth for mild nausea.[10]

<p>

Crude marijuana has even less to recommend it. First, no approved
drug is smoked. In the same way that tobacco is known to induce
lung cancer, smoking marijuana increases chances of cancer, too.
Billy Martin, a professor at the Virginia Commonwealth University's
medical college, said, &quot;There is good scientific evidence
showing adverse effects of smoking marijuana. Certainly it has
much higher tar content than cigarettes.&quot;[11] One study found
that marijuana smoking resulted in up to four times the respiratory
burden of an equivalent amount of tobacco smoking.[12] A September,
1993, National Institute on Drug Abuse update reported, &quot;Daily
use of one to three marijuana joints appears to produce approximately
the same lung damage and potential cancer risk as smoking five
times as many cigarettes.&quot;[13]

<p>

When marijuana supporters advocate smoking the drug for the rest
of a patient's life (for conditions like MS or glaucoma), it seems
strange to promote a &quot;treatment&quot; that could very well
promote disease and hasten death. Moreover, at a time when tobacco
products are roundly criticized, legalizing a similar product
for supposedly medicinal purposes would be hypocritical.

<p>

Besides the adverse effects of smoking, marijuana use is related
to amotivation syndrome in chronic users, characterized by a loss
of energy, general apathy, and impairment of concentration. Sedation
and lethargy are very common. Acute negative psychological effects
could include flashbacks, panic attacks, and disorientation.[14]

<p>

Additionally, for each of the diseases listed in Frank's bill,
scientific studies and the vast majority of doctors cast doubts
on marijuana's usefulness compared to currently approved drugs.

<p>

Simply put, glaucoma is gradual blindness caused when fluid pressure
inside the eye (intraocular pressure) is too high. Crude marijuana,
like alcohol ingestion, can reduce that pressure. But to arrest
glaucoma's progress, marijuana would have to be ingested chronically
-- every day of a patient's life -- in order to be effective.
On the topic of glaucoma, a 1994 Drug Enforcement Administration
manual cited Dr. Keith Green. Green has served on the boards of
eight ophthalmological journals, and performed extensive research
on the relationship between marijuana and glaucoma. According
to the manual, Dr. Green &quot;suggests that in order to decrease
intraocular pressure, one would have to smoke the equivalent of
six joints a day.&quot;[15]

<p>

In studies analyzing the effect of marijuana on glaucoma, heavy
doses were needed to reach the point at which intraocular pressure
was reduced. In some studies, the effect of the necessary dosage
of marijuana caused patients to become quite drowsy. Researchers
reported, &quot;Our subjects were sometimes too sleepy to permit
measurement of intraocular pressures. . . three hours after 
intoxication.&quot;[16]

<p>

A 1994 Drug Watch publication entitled, &quot;Glaucoma: Is Marijuana
a Safe and Effective Treatment?&quot; reported that &quot;the
country's leading ophthalmologists are 'chagrined' and 'disturbed'
to hear that claims are being made touting marijuana as a treatment
for glaucoma.&quot;[17]

<p>

Vomiting because of chemotherapy treatment is a serious concern
of cancer patients and their doctors. While smoked marijuana has
some ability to control vomiting, doctors still say it is not
as effective as other, safer drugs. In an overview of antiemetic
(anti-vomiting) drugs in the <I>New England Journal of Medicine</I>,
the authors addressed cannabis derivatives that were used as antiemetics.
Dronabinol usage entailed serious side-effects, including &quot;dysphoria,
hallucinations, sedation, vertigo, dry mouth, and disorientation,
and are therefore seldom used as first-line antiemetic therapy.&quot;
The authors do find hope in cannabinoids, though: &quot;Synthetic
cannabinoids with no psychotropic activity have antiemetic 
activity.&quot;[18] Thus, cannabinoids could lead to anti-vomiting drugs 
in the future that don't have the mindbending effects that marijuana and 
its active ingredients have. This does not mean, of course, that crude
marijuana is that hope. Scientific studies have shown that marijuana
is not preferable to Marinol, which is itself not preferable to
other anti-vomiting drugs.[19]

<p>

Neither should marijuana be used as a treatment for spasticity
resulting from neurological disorders. The DEA manual, written
by Tom Pool, claimed, &quot;Experts on MS absolutely reject this
proposition.&quot;[20] Pool quotes Dr. Donald Silberberg, the Chair
of the Department of Neurology at the University of Pennsylvania
School of Medicine: &quot;The use of (marijuana), especially for
long-term treatment. . . would be worse than the original disease
itself.&quot;[21]

<p>

Of course, some MS sufferers adamantly claim marijuana helps control
their spasticity. These subjective anecdotes, unfortunately, have
not been borne out in clinical studies. One recent study indicated
that even while MS patients thought they were being helped by
smoking marijuana, their actual balance and coordination were
made worse.[22]

<p>

Using marijuana for treating AIDS patients brings more concerns.

<p>

Pool wrote, &quot;First, studies conducted at the Virginia Medical
College suggest that the THC in marijuana damages the immune system,
making the patient more susceptible to colds, viruses, and influenza
while at the same time increasing the severity of any illnesses
that the patient has. Clearly, the last thing that a patient with
AIDS needs is to have his or her immune system weakened. Second,
the marijuana smoke itself is damaging to the AIDS patients.&quot;[23]

<p>

Advocates of medicinal marijuana continually make claims that
might lead the unsuspecting to believe that marijuana is actually
a miracle drug. For example, one pamphlet published by the Colorado
Hemp Initiative Project stated, &quot;Cannabis is two to three
times as effective as are currently legal medicines for reducing
Intra-Ocular Pressure, without toxic side-effects or damage to
liver and kidneys associated with presently approved drugs.&quot;[24]
Yet, in an evaluation of glaucoma treatment published in the <I>New
England Journal of Medicine</I>, marijuana isn't even mentioned
-- odd, if it is indeed two to three times as effective as any
other drug.[25]

<p>

Voth summarized the issue by noting, &quot;The pro-drug lobby
would have the public and policy makers incorrectly believe that
crude marijuana is the only treatment alternative for masses of
cancer sufferers who are going untreated for the nausea associated
with chemotherapy, glaucoma, multiple sclerosis, and other 
ailments.&quot;[26]

<p>

Pro-marijuana arguments heavily rely on anecdotal evidence instead
of controlled studies. Many people make the claim that marijuana
use has helped control aspects of various diseases. However, anecdotes
are notoriously inaccurate or statistically misleading.

<p>

Robert Peterson, the director of Michigan's Office of Drug Control
Policy from 1991-1995, wrote, &quot;One must look closely at anecdotal
evidence. In some of the most celebrated cases, the individual
smoked pot before he or she ever got ill. Marijuana is addictive
and addicts tend to feel better when they receive their drug.
. . . There is no doubt that using a euphoric drug such as marijuana,
alcohol, cocaine or heroin will make a sick person feel better.
That does not make a drug a medicine.&quot;[27]

<p>

The DEA petition echoes Peterson. &quot;Sick people are not objective
scientific observers, especially when it comes to their own health.
We all have heard of the placebo effect. Patients have a tendency
to respond to drugs as they believe is expected of them. . . Stories
of marijuana's benefits from sick people with a prior history
of marijuana abuse may be based on rationalizations caused by
drug dependence, not on any medical benefits caused by the drug.&quot;[28]

<p>

Legislators considering legalizing marijuana as a type of folk
medicine should also consider the secondary effects of that action.
Past experience has shown that it is not uncommon for drugs distributed
by doctors that are otherwise illegal to spread from the patient
to his or her acquaintances and friends. Also, public attitudes
toward marijuana as a recreational drug probably would begin to
change if medicinal uses were approved. Already, youth are beginning
to see marijuana as a benign or even beneficial drug due to some
highly successful propaganda by groups like NORML. If, as the
evidence suggests, marijuana will not add anything to the American
medicine cabinet, any increased collateral use and resulting damage
would have to be added to the cost of rescheduling crude marijuana.

<p>

Certainly, pro-marijuana groups have performed admirably in disseminating
their views. Now, the voices of the objective medical establishment
need to match their enthusiasm, and inform the public of the truth
about medicinal uses of marijuana and the motivations behind the
arguments.

<h2>WILL EXCHANGING NEEDLES<br>
SAVE AMERICA'S FUTURE?</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

A 1995 government-commissioned study claims that giving clean
needles to addicts will slow the spread of the AIDS virus without
encouraging drug abuse. While there is reason to question this
claim, even if the spread of HIV among intravenous drug users
(IDU) were slowed, this action would create some potentially undesirable
effects.

<p>

The fight to establish federally-funded needle exchange programs
(NEP) is being urged as a wedge issue to gain drug legalization.
Linking drug addiction with the emotion-charged AIDS epidemic
under the pro-drug umbrella called &quot;harm reduction&quot;
is good political strategy, but it's a bad idea that is gathering
momentum, and it must be countered.

<p>

Supporters of federally-funded NEPs are rallying around this issue.
Leading NEP researcher Peter Lurie, a professor with the Institute
for Health Policy Studies, University of California San Francisco,
says the 1995 study is &quot;a vindication for all of the needle
exchange workers around the country, as well as the scientists
who have been coming to these conclusions for years....[The government]
can no longer hide from the weight of scientific evidence....&quot;[1]

<p>

In response to the American needle study, the respected British
medical journal <I>Lancet</I> said, &quot;It is time for the U.S.
to catch up with so much of the world....Needle exchanges do not
increase drug use in programme [sic] participants. They do not
encourage or increase the number of drug users. They do not increase
the number of needles lying about; they do not destroy cities,
or towns or neighborhoods.&quot;[2]

<p>

Dr. Lincoln Moses, chairman of the 15-member panel that led the
government's NEP study, said, &quot;We must consider the reality
that people do use drugs and that HIV is transmitted in growing
numbers by injection drug use.&quot;[3]

<p>

Not everyone agrees with those who favor needle exchange. Donna
Shalala, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), has
doubts. Shalala told <I>CNN</I> that &quot;different experts disagree&quot;
as to the efficacy of needle exchange.[4] Philip Lee, Shalala's assistant and 
a former needle exchange researcher, called NEPs &quot;an extraordinarily
complex public policy strategy&quot;[5] and expressed concern that
NEPs &quot;may send a mixed message about drug use.&quot;[6]

<p>

Roman Catholic Cardinal John O'Connor said, &quot;It [needle exchange]
drags down the standards of all society.... It is an act born
of desperation.&quot;[7] Reverend Calvin Butts, pastor of the Abyssinian
Baptist Church in Harlem, agrees. &quot;I am not in favor of cooperating
with evil,&quot; said Butts. &quot;If we give out needles now...the
next step will be to legalize crack and heroin.&quot;[8] This may
be the ultimate goal of proponents of these programs.

<p>

<center><h3>LEGAL BACKGROUND</h3></center>

<p>

In 1992, Congress ordered HHS to request a study of NEPs by the
National Academy of Sciences (NAS), an independent, Congressionally-chartered,
non-government research agency. If the Academy found that NEPs
were shown to be effective in reducing HIV infection while not
encouraging drug use, then the Surgeon General could lift the
ban on federal financing for such programs, Congress said.

<p>

The Academy concluded its study in 1995 and reported that well-implemented
NEPs can be effective in preventing the spread of HIV and do not
increase the use of illegal drugs. NAS recommended that &quot;[t]he
Surgeon General make the determination called for in Public Law
102-394, section 514, 1993, necessary to rescind the present prohibition
against applying any federal funds to support needle exchange
programs.&quot;[9]

<p>

While addicts can legally buy needles in all but nine states without
a medical prescription, 45 states have laws making it a crime
to carry a needle and syringe.[10] Police in these states argue that
the criminalization of drug paraphernalia helps successful drug
arrests and prosecutions.

<p>

In 1992, Connecticut modified its syringe law to permit the possession
and purchase of up to 10 needles without a prescription. But a
state-sponsored survey found that IDU needle sharing did not change
with the new law.[11]

<p>

Community NEPs do not slow illegal needle sales. Numerous studies
have found that even where NEPs operate and syringes are available
without prescription, IDUs remain dependent upon black market
sources for needles.[12]

<p>

<center><h3>THE BATTLEGROUND</h3></center>

<p>

Needle Exchange Programs are intended to curb the practice of
sharing needles among IDUs to reduce the risk of transmitting
the AIDS virus. Residual blood retained in a shared syringe can
be passed along to the next person using the syringe. This high-risk
behavior infects perhaps 20,000 Americans with the AIDS virus
every year.[13]

<p>

Providing addicts with clean needles may slow the spread of the
AIDS virus, but questions remain. Will it lead to more responsible
behavior? Will it lead addicts to seek drug treatment? Will this
practice encourage more drug abuse?

<p>

Researchers discovered that the bite of the infected female anopheles
mosquito transmitted malaria. To slow malaria's spread, researchers
theorized, the mosquito had to be destroyed. It worked. Dr. Lurie
argues that replacing tainted drug needles with clean ones would
be analogous to removing the malaria vector.[14]

<p>

Nationwide, almost one-third of all AIDS cases are associated
with IDUs. This includes almost 60 percent of children under age
13 who contracted the virus from mothers who were abusers or who
were sex partners of IDUs.[15] Today, shared needles are blamed for
more HIV infections than in the past.

<p>

In 1981, only 12 percent of AIDS victims contracted the virus
from needles but in 1993 that number had risen to 29 percent.[16]
During the same period the proportion of new cases of HIV transmission
due to sex between men declined from 74 percent to 47 percent.[17]

<p>

Most of the IDUs are found in the 96 largest metropolitan areas.
These areas also include 85 percent of all reported AIDS cases,
and nearly a quarter (23.5 percent) of all IDUs are located in
just six cities: Boston, New York City, Newark, Philadelphia,
Baltimore and Washington, D.C.[18]

<p>

The total number of IDUs is hard to predict. The U.S. Public Health
Service reports that the population exceeds one million.[19] The 1994
National Household Survey on Drug Abuse found that 2,580,000 Americans
have used needles to inject illicit drugs in their lives and 257,000
have done so in the past year.[20] A 1994 CDC report estimates that
in the nation's largest metropolitan areas alone the IDU population
exceeds 1.5 million.[21]

<p>

<center><h3>WHO ARE THE ADDICTS?</h3></center>

<p>

Terri is a 29-year-old Hispanic mother of two and an IDU. She
said, &quot;In the beginning, it was fun. I felt like Superman....It
was like I had an 'S' on my chest and I had my mask on, and I
could conquer the world. The drugs took away the bad feelings.&quot;[22]

<p>

Terri, like many addicts, started injecting just to get high.
Soon she found that the drugs were causing more pain than relief.
To support her $200-a-day habit, Terri sold heroin, got caught,
and lost custody of her children.[23] There are more than 200,000
addicts like Terri in New York City alone.[24]

<p>

According to another addict, &quot;Shooting drugs is not a rational
act....I know what it's like to be scared of getting AIDS, but
I needed to get high so bad that I didn't think about the risk.&quot;[25]

<p>

Dr. Steven Koester, an anthropologist at the University of Colorado
Health Sciences Center in Denver, explains why addicts share needles
in spite of the AIDS scare. &quot;The laws against having syringes
made it too risky to carry them on the way to get heroin. It created
an artificial scarcity. They were sharing because they had to
-- not because of some ritual for bonding.&quot; After buying
their dope, said Koester, addicts &quot;go to the closest place
where they can have privacy and get a syringe.&quot; This is typically
a &quot;shooting gallery&quot; where, for a small fee, they can
get privacy and a needle to use.[26]

<p>

It's difficult for an addict to stop injecting drugs because heroin
depletes key body chemicals. With these gone, the body experiences
intense drug cravings and withdrawal symptoms are unpleasant.
That's why a heroin addict may need four to six injections each
day, 120 to 180 times per month or 1,500 times per year. Frequent
injections with shared needles lead to increased chances of contracting
blood-borne diseases like HIV.[27]

<p>

<center><h3>HOW NEPS WORK</h3></center>

<p>

The typical NEP client is male, has been injecting between seven
and 20 years and is between 33 and 41 years old.[28] Racial/ethnic
distributions vary considerably depending upon location. One-third
to one-half of NEP clients have never been in drug treatment.[29]

<p>

The Lower East Side Harm Reduction Center [New York City] provides
numerous services. Addicts can get &quot;shooter's supplies&quot;
like alcohol pads, cotton balls, cookers, condoms, bottles of
bleach and clean water. The exchange hands out about 1,000 needles
an hour[30] or between 15,000 and 20,000 each week.[31]

<p>

The exchange also helps addicts get into treatment programs, solves
housing problems, gives lessons on safer ways of shooting drugs,
and keeps tabs on the heroin that has made its clients sick. Warnings
about bad heroin are identified by their street names on a chalkboard
hung inside the center.[32]

<p>

Mark Gerse, the center's director, said, &quot;We've become an
information clearinghouse. If we didn't get the word out, it would
take a series of deaths to get people's attention.&quot;[33]

<p>

Terri uses the Lower East Side needle exchange which operates
out of a storefront in a residential area populated by working
poor. She explains, &quot;This place gives me hope and it makes
me feel loved....This place keeps you from hurting yourself until
you're able to make a choice to straighten yourself out.&quot;[34]

<p>

Another addict who has been mainlining for more than a decade,
said, &quot;It's good to know that there's someone actually looking
after us because the truth is, nobody else cares if we kill ourselves
with bad dope.&quot;[35]

<p>

There are approximately 75 NEPs in 55 U.S. cities.[36] They operate
either from fixed sites (stationary van, storefront, street, and
health facility) or mobile sites (walk route, deliveries and roving
vans) operating a median 10 hours per week. They are staffed with
a combination of paid employees and volunteers who may provide
a variety of services in addition to exchanging needles, such
as HIV testing/counseling, tuberculosis screening, screening for
sexually transmitted diseases, primary medical care and substance
abuse treatment.[37]

<p>

<center><h3>THE SWISS NEEDLE EXPERIMENT</h3></center>

<p>

In 1986, to counter the drug problem, the Swiss began experimenting
with NEPs. The first step was to make syringes available in every
pharmacy. Switzerland also legalized syringe sales via public
vending machines. For three francs or about $2.43, anyone can
buy two syringes, extra needles, alcohol, swabs, gauze, and a
condom packaged in a cigarette-sized pack labeled &quot;Flash.&quot;[38]

<p>

In 1988, Zurich's Platzpitz Park was opened for free needle distribution.
Up to 300 syringes were given away each day. The original aim
had been to create a &quot;safe&quot; place for Zurich's own addicts.
But before long, the city was flooded with foreign addicts. The
number of needles exchanged grew to 12,000 per day before the
park was closed in 1992.[39]

<p>

After police closed Platzpitz, thousands of addicts relocated
a half-mile away to an abandoned railway station called &quot;Letten&quot;
where the Swiss experiment evolved into a grotesque spectacle.
Needle exchanges grew to 15,000 per day.[40]

<p>

Letten became a war zone between rival drug-dealing gangs. When
police tried to investigate crimes, they faced gunfire and their
cars were attacked and overturned by addicts. Local police arrested
a drug dealer after the fourth murder within just one month. Fellow
drug dealers stormed the police station demanding the man's release
or else they would blow-up the station.[41] He was released. In February,
1995, Swiss authorities closed Letten and moved the addicts to
government-sponsored centers and &quot;shooting galleries.&quot;

<p>

Dr. Franziska Haller, a Swiss psychologist, pharmacist, and anti-drug
activist, said that Zurich's permissive drug policy was designed
to put pressure on the federal government to start a nationwide
heroin distribution program. She says this is a big step toward
drug legalization -- the ultimate goal of pro-drug forces.

<p>

Opposition to NEPs and government-sponsored heroin experiments
has not been tolerated. Doctors who protested the initial NEP
were quashed by the media and pro-NEP physicians. Even a public
school teacher who warned her elementary students about the risks
of illicit drugs lost her job because of pressure from pro-drug
groups. One of her students had died from a heroin overdose.[42]

<p>

Switzerland has the highest heroin addiction rate (30,000 addicts)
and second highest HIV infection rate in Europe. It experiences
between 350 and 400 illicit drug overdose deaths each year.[43] To
address the growing problem without experiencing more &quot;Lettens,&quot;
the Swiss federal government started giving drugs to some addicts.
Switzerland has an ongoing experiment in nine cities where heroin,
morphine and methadone are given to addicts. The project, which
is scheduled to end in December, 1996, includes 700 addicts. Nearly
half of these addicts are HIV-positive. They are given free drugs
up to nine times a day. At night they are given heroin cigarettes
to be used at home. The cost is covered by health insurance or
the government.[44]

<p>

Dr. Andre Seidenberg, who runs a Swiss government-sponsored heroin
maintenance clinic for 100 addicts, believes that &quot;[h]eroin
consumption should be medicalized.&quot; He would &quot;like to
see heroin distribution trials in the U.S.&quot;[45]

<p>

The experiment's aim is to improve addict health, decrease criminal
activity, cut addicts off from drug dealers and stop abuse. Unfortunately,
the number of addicts is rising, and the experiment has not cut
illegal drug abuse and crime. It is also reported that police
officials in Bern and Zurich have been ordered not to arrest drug
consumers and dealers.[46]

<p>

On July 1, 1995, Swiss prison authorities began experimenting
with heroin-addicted inmates. Junkie prisoners with at least a
nine-month sentence who were age 20 and older were given heroin.
The rationale for this experiment was not announced.[47]

<p>

It appears that Switzerland is moving towards drug legalization.
The problems associated with NEPs and drug maintenance programs
have contributed to a shift in attitude toward drugs. On November
9, 1995, 94 Swiss executives called for the government to embrace
a &quot;harm reduction&quot; strategy that includes an expansion
of the legal heroin distribution program. Six of the executives
were representatives of American companies in Switzerland: Andersen
Consulting AG, American Express, Polaroid, Atag Ernst &amp; Young
AG, Agfa Gevaert AG and Revisuisse Price Waterhouse AG.[48]

<p>

Roland C. Rasi, general manager of the Swiss Bank Corporation,
spoke for the executives when he announced the 11-part &quot;harm
reduction&quot; strategy. The strategy would shift funds from
enforcement to treatment such as medicalized heroin distribution.
It would also demand that Swiss companies employ drug addicts
in order to better integrate them into society. He described one
Swiss company that proudly hires auto mechanics who are addicted
to heroin.

<p>

In 1996, the Swiss people will decide whether to legalize now-illicit
drugs. The vote is expected to be close. Dr. Haller said she hopes
America does not follow Switzerland's drug example.

<p>

<center><h3>WHAT DOES THE RESEARCH SAY ABOUT NEPS?</h3></center>

<p>

The Washington-based Drug Policy Foundation (DPF), which is supported
by pro-drug billionaire George Soros, has hosted several Capitol
Hill seminars to brief Congressional staff about NEPs. Arnold
Trebach, DPF's president and an American University professor,
said at one of the seminars that the &quot;[d]ominant morality
is that drug abuse is a greater threat than AIDS.&quot;[49] Trebach
said the federal government's needle exchange policy is &quot;obscene.&quot;
He says the research supports NEPs.

<p>

In September, 1995, the National Academy of Sciences announced
the results of its government-requested study of NEPs in its work,
&quot;Preventing HIV Transmission: The Role of Sterile Needles
and Bleach&quot;.[50] The panel called for the Surgeon General to
rescind the present prohibition against applying any federal funds
to support NEPs.

<p>

Dr. Moses, the study chairman, said that data from a program in
New Haven showed that the rate of HIV infection in needles turned
into the exchange had decreased by one-third.[51]

<p>

Edward Kaplan, a professor with Yale University's School of Management,
evaluated the New Haven NEP. Kaplan, a statistician, says he is
not an NEP advocate, but that he believes NEPs are effective.[52]

<p>

Moses also cited a study in Tacoma, Washington, which found a
dramatic drop in blood-borne diseases after an NEP started. That
study examined hepatitis B infection rates among NEP participants
and found these people were eight times less likely than non-participants
to contract the blood-borne infection. This study is supposedly
analogous for HIV infections.[53]

<p>

Dr. Don Des Jarlais, research director of the Chemical Dependency
Institute at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York, endorses
NAS's recommendation. &quot;Anyone who's looking at it from the
perspective of preventing HIV transmission,&quot; said Des Jarlais,
&quot;comes to the conclusion that we ought to be doing more syringe
exchange.&quot;[54]

<p>

Dr. Peter Lurie led a CDC-funded study entitled, &quot;The Public
Health Impact of Needle Exchange Programs in the United States
and Abroad,&quot; 1993. The study evaluated 23 of the programs
in 15 cities across four countries. His study was extensively
reported by the NAS. Lurie concluded that NEPs &quot;do not appear
to increase drug use and do prevent HIV infections in injecting
drug users, their sex partners, and their children.&quot;[55] His
700-page report calls for more federal funds for NEPs, repeal
of laws precluding purchase of syringes without a prescription,
and repeal of paraphernalia laws.

<p>

Lurie's analysis evaluated eight needle exchange studies that
measured drug use levels. Only one study showed an increase in
drug use. Three showed a decrease, and four found no change. Lurie
found 10 of 14 other studies that showed a reduction in HIV infection
among NEP participants.[56]

<p>

Lurie's report acknowledges numerous problems:

<p><ul>

<li>None of the studies reviewed were &quot;randomized; self-reported
behavior (subject to response bias) was often used as an outcome;
follow-up was often poor; and risk behavior was often only roughly
measured.&quot;[57]

<p>

<li>Lurie admits that he can't determine whether NEPs change the
community level of drug use, and he found no evidence that NEPs
increase use of drug treatment.[58]

<p>

<li>With regard to New Haven-type studies that test only syringes,
Lurie says, &quot;The validity of testing of syringes is limited.&quot;[59]

<p>

<li>On the key issue whether NEPs effect HIV infection rates,
Lurie states, &quot;Studies of the effect of NEPs on HIV infection
rates...probably cannot provide clear evidence that NEPs decrease
HIV infection rates. However, NEPs do not appear to be associated
with increased rates of HIV infection.&quot;[60]

</ul><p>

Even a 1993 General Accounting Office report concludes, &quot;Research
suggests [that syringe exchange programs have] promise as an AIDS
prevention strategy.&quot;[61] GAO's &quot;promise&quot; and Lurie's
&quot;cannot provide&quot; are not comforting conclusions.

<p>

On April 6, 1995, ABC's Catherine Crier interviewed Ton Quadt,
the Dutch Drug Rehabilitation Coordinator. Quadt said, &quot;If
you put in enough clean syringes and needles, people don't have
to use dirty needles, so the risk of getting HIV is lessened.&quot;
Since the program began 10 years ago, the AIDS infection rate
of those in the program has dropped from 11 percent to 4 percent.[62]

<p>

Enthusiasm for NAS's recommendation to lift the ban on NEP funding
is not universally shared. Assistant Secretary of HHS Philip Lee
said, &quot;I have not been convinced on the evidence that has
been presented so far.&quot;[63] His skepticism is well founded.

<p>

On October 16, 1989, then Secretary of HHS Louis Sullivan hosted
a conference with 12 scientific and legal experts to discuss NEPs.[64]
The consultants recommended designing a new multi-center experiment
lasting three to five years. Unfortunately, that recommendation
was never undertaken.

<p>

Lead consultant Dr. Edward Brandt, Jr., a former Assistant Secretary
for Health and then the Executive Dean of the College of Medicine
of the University of Oklahoma, said, &quot;It will be extraordinarily
difficult to provide a scientifically rigorous answer [with regard
to NEPs slowing HIV infection without increasing drug abuse].&quot;[65]

<p>

Considering the NEPs at that time, Brandt concluded, &quot;It
is not possible to perform a meaningful evaluation of existing
programs because none were designed and initiated with a stringent
evaluation approach as a primary objective. Also, comparison among
programs through a multi-center evaluation is not possible because
of major differences in program objectives, design, and operation.&quot;[66]

<p>

Brandt's reservations are evidenced in key studies cited in the
NAS report. For example, the New Haven study is based on a mathematical
model using six independent variables to predict the rate of infection.
The unreliability of any of these variables invalidates the result.

<p>

The New Haven study includes key assumptions. For example, it
assumes that any needle returned by a participant other than the
one to whom it had been issued had been shared and that any needle
returned by a participant to whom it had been issued had been
unshared.[67] Both assumptions are suspect.

<p>

More than half (60 percent) of the New Haven participants dropped
out. Those who remained in the program were most likely motivated
to protect themselves from infection and the drop-outs likely
continued in their high-risk lifestyles.[68]

<p>

The Yale study fails to consider the seroconversion rates in addicts
and also relies on self-reporting by addicts, a group not known
for reliability.

<p>

Additionally, most NEPs provide a host of services which account
for some of the reported &quot;success.&quot; Outreach programs
without needle exchange have been shown to have some effect.

<p>

Dr. Janet Lapey, a medical doctor, studies NEPs for Drug Watch
International, a worldwide anti-drug organization.[69] She critiqued
NAS's report, saying:

<p><ul>

<li>It downplays sexual transmission of HIV among addicts. Some
resort to prostitution to fund their addiction. After all, non-needle
using crack addicts have high incidence of HIV.

<p>

<li>It cites a NEP study that had no increase in heroin use by
young users. This is not surprising given that NEPs and drug treatment
programs are usually populated by older drug users.

<p>

<li>It fails to interview neighborhood residents near NEPs to
see whether they approve of the effect of these programs.

<p>

<li>It trivializes the drug problem and provides no solutions
other than NEPs.

<p>

<li>It does not cite studies that measured HIV seroconversion
rates, the only true indication of effectiveness.

<p>

<li>It does not measure whether drug use rises in NEP service
areas.

<p>

<li>It gives credibility to pro-needle studies and claims that
anti-needle studies are lacking. She says this biased use of statistics
is analogous to the tobacco companies using statisticians to support
their claim that smoking does not cause cancer.

</ul><p>

James L. Curtis, director of the Department of Psychiatry, Harlem
Hospital Center, wrote to New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman
to recommend against NEPs. Curtis said, &quot;On the unproved
assumption that these programs prevent the spread of AIDS, addicts
are actively encouraged to continue to inject themselves with
illegal drugs, and are exempted from arrest in areas surrounding
the needle exchange program. Indeed the addict is partially financed
in continuing this self-damaging behavior.&quot;[70]

<p>

Finally, Dr. Mitchell Rosenthal, director of the Phoenix House
Foundation, a drug treatment organization, said, &quot;I don't
think we have any data yet that is compelling that needle exchange
is making a difference.&quot;[71]

<p>

<center><h3>POLICY DILEMMA</h3></center>

<p>

California Governor Pete Wilson vetoed a bill that would have
authorized state-funded NEPs. He explained, the &quot;[r]eal question...is
whether the hoped-for reduction in needle-transmitted HIV infection
justifies sending a mixed message that will threaten to undermine
the credibility of all society's other anti-drug efforts -- especially
those preventive education efforts aimed at dissuading young audiences
from choosing to engage in drug use.&quot;[72]

<p>

The NAS agrees with Wilson's reservations. The report says, &quot;The
long-term effects of these programs on the level of illicit drug
use in communities are not yet known.&quot;[73] It acknowledges that
&quot;the act of giving a needle to an IDU has a powerful symbolism
that has sparked fears about the potential negative effects of
NEPs.&quot;[74]

<p>

Wilson recognizes the hyperbolic nature of a pro-needle policy.
&quot;If we are going to demand that young people exercise personal
responsibility,&quot; Wilson explained, and &quot;if we say that
they must suffer the consequences of their personal choices, [then]
what are they to think, when in the next breath we give formal
sanction to a project which facilitates drug use?&quot;[75]

<p>

Congressman Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.) opposes NEPs. He has said,
&quot;Our goal should be to eliminate drug abuse, not to find
a cleaner, safer way to do it. Sure, IV drug abusers put themselves
at risk of AIDS through sharing needles and, certainly, we want
to slow its spread, but there are better ways than giving addicts
needles to do their drugs.&quot;[76]

<p>

Former national drug czar William Bennett agrees. NEPs are rejected
because they &quot;may also confound a community's anti-drug efforts
by implicitly condoning the intravenous use of illegal drugs.&quot;[77]

<p>

Lee Brown, who resigned as President Clinton's drug czar last
December, said the Office of National Drug Control Policy &quot;can
find no compelling reason for the administration to depart from
existing federal policy regarding needle exchange...[It] is neither
an adequate substitute for drug treatment nor a preferred means
of entry into drug treatment.&quot;[78]

<p>

Dr. Moses, chairman of the NAS panel, claims that NEPs &quot;often
result in more referrals to drug abuse treatment.&quot;[79] Evidence
to support this statement is minimal.

<p>

Most addicts in treatment are there because of a run-in with the
criminal justice system, not because of a run-in with an NEP.
According to Dr. Lapey, only 16 percent of NEP participants voluntarily
enter treatment.[80]

<p>

Two of the three medical doctors on the NAS panel, Dr. Herbert
D. Kleber and Dr. Lawrence S. Brown, claim that the news media
have exaggerated NAS's findings and that NEPs &quot;are not the
panacea their supporters hope for....We personally believe that
the spread of HIV is better combated by the expansion and improvement
of drug abuse treatment rather than NEPs, and any government funds
should instead be used for that purpose.&quot;[81]

<p>

A myth associated with NEPs is that there is a long wait for treatment.
But according to Rosenthal, treatment candidates are not turned
away without help. There is a four-week waiting period for in-patient
treatment, but all candidates for admission are placed into a
&quot;day care&quot; program until such time as beds become available.
The &quot;day care&quot; unit lasts eight hours a day, and patients
can receive AIDS education and counseling.[82]

<p>

Rosenthal says that the greatest HIV threat among heterosexuals
is from sexual contact, not dirty needles. Clean needles will
not modify sexual behavior in the IDU. He explains that in the
New Haven study, fewer than a third of the participants employed
safe-sex practices most of the time.[83]

<p>

Dr. David Williams of the University of Michigan Institute for
Social Research says that NEPs raise important ethical and moral
problems. &quot;People can be morally compelled,&quot; said Williams,
&quot;to support a lesser harm [drug abuse] in order to overcome
a greater harm [AIDS].&quot;[84]

<p>

In response to this philosophy, Rep. Rangel said, &quot;Supporters
of free needles may have their hearts in the right place, but
they have overlooked some very important considerations. These
people should enlist in efforts to expand comprehensive treatment
and rehabilitation services. Better to stop needle use altogether.&quot;[85]

<p>

<center><h3>HOW MUCH SUPPORT DO NEPS ENJOY?</h3></center>

<p>

The DPF and the NAS report say that the public favors NEPs. They
site a 1994 survey of 1,001 Americans by Peter D. Hart Research
Associates, Inc., Washington, D.C., which showed that 55 percent
favor implementing NEPs to reduce the spread of diseases such
as AIDS.[86]

<p>

The NAS report also profiles 23 other surveys with mixed results.
A 1988 <I>CBS News/New York Times</I> national poll found that
only 40 percent of Americans favor giving injection drug users
sterilized needles to slow down the spread of AIDS. A 1989 Media
General/<I>Associated Press</I> national poll found that half
of all Americans favor giving needles to addicts given the promise
that it will slow down the spread of AIDS.[87]

<p>

To measure America's commitment to NEPs, pollsters should set
a better context for the needle question. Perhaps the pollster
should ask, &quot;Would you support giving clean needles to drug
addicts to slow the spread of HIV, if you knew that this policy
shift might increase illicit drug use among America's youth?&quot;
Most likely, a majority of Americans would answer &quot;no.&quot;

<p>

<center><h3>WHAT ARE THE SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES?</h3></center>

<p>

There is ample evidence that NEPs contribute to serious social
consequences for affected communities. For example, Regina Policastro,
an editor for a small Boston newspaper, wrote about her experience
with an NEP client. On November 11, 1991, &quot;a woman, having
received a state-provided free needle, engaged in prostitution,
and overdosed right in front of Policastro's child in her yard.&quot;[88]
Police did nothing because the woman had an authorized needle
identification card.

<p>

The plentiful supply of free needles has created a rogue practice.
The <I>Boston Herald</I> reports that Boston police were on the
lookout for a junkie who obtains allegedly AIDS-tainted needles
from a local NEP and then sells them for use as weapons. An unidentified
Boston officer overheard schoolkids say, &quot;It's better than
a gun because a gun you can do time for.&quot;[89] Similar scares
are common among New York City commuters.

<p>

Reverend Steve Peterson, pastor of Holy Cross Lutheran Church
in Madison, Wisconsin, expressed grave concern that Madison's
NEP -- which is only 250 feet from the school -- will put his
parish elementary school children at risk. He explained, &quot;Our
concern is that the needle exchange violates the spirit of the
drug-free zone.&quot;[90]

<p>

Milt McPike, a Madison high school principal, said, &quot;I have
a lot of concerns about stuff like that [NEPs] near schools.&quot;[91]
His job is to protect children, and their welfare must be balanced
with the need to control HIV among drug addicts.

<p>

Nancy Sosman knows all too well the problems NEPs bring to a community.
Sosman is a member of the Coalition for a Better Community, a
New York City citizens group opposed to NEPs. Since the Lower
East Side NEP began, she says, &quot;We've seen an increase in
dirty syringes on our streets, in our school yards and in our
parks....There has been a dramatic increase in the public display
of injecting drugs.... Brazen addicts shoplift, loot and steal
to buy drugs.&quot;[92] Sosman says that there are no controls on
the number of syringes given to an addict at the NEP and in fact,
she has seen NEP participants sell their syringes to buy drugs.
Even &quot;exchange workers have been photographed selling needles
away from the NEP.&quot;[93]

<p>

New Haven Police Chief Nicholas Pastore supports NEPs. Pastore
told ABC's Catherine Crier, &quot;The thing that I feel good about
is that that heroin addict is not preying on society, is not killing
somebody, not banging somebody on the head, not breaking into
your or my home. They're getting help....&quot;[94]

<p>

That's not Nancy Sosman's observation. She says that the NEP participants
fan out into her neighborhood &quot;to buy drugs, use drugs, sell
drugs and steal to get money for drugs. Our local police will
never be able to stop the trafficking of illegal drugs.&quot;[95]

<p>

Curtis contends that NEPs are bad medicine. &quot;The police make
no attempt to arrest addicts even though it still is illegal to
possess and inject illegal drugs. The drug dealers flock to these
neighborhoods in order to sell drugs which are openly used even
in broad daylight. These neighborhoods experience dramatic deterioration
with a corrupting influence on many candy stores, newspaper stands
and grocery stores. The sidewalks are littered with used and bloody
needles, syringes and empty vials of crack cocaine. Furthermore
some addicts make a business of selling these needles to purchase
other drugs such as cocaine which they prefer.[96]

<p>

Curtis continues, &quot;Addicts commonly support their habit by
selling drugs to other addicts, by recruiting new addicts, and
by prostitution or by exchanging sex for drugs, all of which behavior
contributes to spread of the AIDS virus.&quot;[97]

<p>

NEPs &quot;promote a breakdown in law and order,&quot; the Harlem
doctor says. &quot;They are poor medicine and poor public health
practice. In fact, these programs constitute a reckless experiment
with human beings, totally unregulated by research guidelines
ordinarily applied to protect human subjects from potentially
dangerous research.&quot;[98]

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

On April 2, 1995, Saudi Arabia beheaded three drug smugglers.
A little earlier, Singapore did the same.[99] There are no NEPs in
Riyadh and few addicts on Singapore's streets. Neither country
has an AIDS epidemic.

<p>

If America seeks to reduce drug use, it must stop coddling addicts.
Drug abusers need treatment, not encouragement to keep injecting
deadly drugs. Although AIDS will kill some, most will die from
drug overdoses or other high-risk behaviors.

<p>

Congressman Rangel tells public officials not to fool themselves
about NEPs. &quot;Can police honestly enforce laws against people
who use 'government-issue' needles when the government is the
very source of the tool to commit the offense?&quot;[100]

<p>

The growing needle exchange debate is really about drug legalization.
Pro-drug forces have nurtured a cadre of scientists and others
to give their fight the appearance of legitimacy. But they have
yet to satisfy the strict, scientific requirements set forth in
the law.

<p>

Before the federal government boards this <I>Titanic</I>, it should
sponsor research like that suggested by former Secretary of HHS
Sullivan or even embrace some of Dr. Lurie's recommendations for
methodologically-sound NEP studies. Then, if the evidence satisfies
the requirements of Congress, the lifting of the funding ban could
be reconsidered.

<p>

In the meantime, missteps with the NEP policy could lead the nation
down a tragic path. NEPs provide no guarantee to solve the AIDS
epidemic nor stop the drug scourge.

<title>THE IMPACT OF ROMER v. EVANS</title>

<h2>THE IMPACT OF <i>ROMER v. EVANS</i></h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Robert H. Knight</i></center>

<p>

On May 20, 1996, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional
Colorado's Amendment 2 to the state constitution, which had prohibited
the state and local jurisdictions from adding &quot;sexual orientation&quot;
to minority protection statutes.  The amendment, approved by a
majority of voters in 1992,  was drafted after several Colorado
cities -- Denver, Boulder, Aspen and Aurora -- had enacted statutes
adding &quot;sexual orientation&quot; to the list of protected
civil rights, thus affording homosexuals a vehicle to use civil
rights law in discrimination claims.

<p>

Amendment 2's sponsors viewed this &quot;special&quot; protection
to homosexuals as a threat to those who believe that homosexuality
is wrong and not a valid category for heightened protection heretofore
reserved for genuinely-disadvantaged minorities.

<p>

In a 6-3 ruling,[1] the court disagreed, saying that Amendment 2
violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment to
the Constitution because the state could not prove a &quot;rational
basis,&quot; that is, a &quot;legitimate legislative end&quot;
for denying homosexuals &quot;the possibility of protection across
the board.&quot;  Thus, the Supreme Court affirmed the earlier
ruling of the trial court and the Colorado Supreme Court in striking
down Amendment 2.

<p>

<center><h3>WHAT IS THE MEANING OF THIS RULING?</h3></center>

<p>

It sweeps aside the right of the people to amend their own state
Constitution, at least with regard to homosexuality.  The court,
in effect, said that it, and it alone, will determine which groups
can be considered &quot;disadvantaged&quot; when they lose a statewide
ballot issue.  By this reasoning, any state that has outlawed
polygamy has &quot;disadvantaged&quot; polygamists by making it
unlawful for them to enact legalization of polygamy at the local
level.  In his forceful dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia addressed
this particular absurdity:  &quot;Has the court concluded that
the perceived social harm of polygamy is a 'legitimate concern
of government,' and the perceived social harm of homosexuality
is not?&quot;

<p>

Homosexual activists now have a guarantee that their opponents
will be prevented ever from rescinding &quot;sexual orientation&quot;
laws at the state level.  Homosexual activists can work to get
&quot;gay rights&quot; laws on the books, but no group of voters
is allowed ever to rescind them at the state level.

<p>

The court's decision has not technically created a brand new class
of specially-protected citizens:  homosexuals.  But no other group
has that kind of heightened protection except for those that have
been designated as &quot;suspect&quot; classes in need of special
protections.  No court -- including the current Supreme Court
-- has ever designated homosexuals as a &quot;suspect class.&quot;

<p>

The cultural impact may be greater than the legal implications.
<I>The New York Times'</I> lead headline on May 21 proclaimed,
&quot;Gay Rights Laws Can't Be Banned, High Court Rules.&quot;
Although technically the ruling only applies to state laws that
bar passage of new gay rights laws, <I>Romer v. Evans</I> was
hailed as a repudiation of any efforts to delay consolidation
of the homosexual agenda.  Within hours of the decision, the Supreme
Court's ruling was cited by an attorney in a lesbian parenting
dispute in Florida, who proclaimed that the high court had outlawed
the use of sexual orientation as a factor in child custody cases.
The court did no such thing, but we can expect more of the same
sweeping interpretations to be used to sway a reeling culture
that has been force-fed homosexual propaganda for the past decade.
As Suzanne Goldberg of Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund
exulted after the decision, &quot;Because the court so clearly
rejected anti-gay sentiment, it plants the seeds for future decisions
rejecting anti-gay decisions in many other areas.&quot;[2]

<p>

<h4>Wasn't this a victory for tolerance of gay and lesbian people?</h4>

<p>

No. Homosexuals have achieved enormous tolerance and are now
seeking state-mandated acceptance of their behavior.  The <I>Romer
</I> decision was a defeat of the Colorado people's desire to create
a level playing field with regard to civil rights.  A majority
of Coloradans passed Amendment 2 so that people who disagree with
the homosexual activist movement would not be subjected to discrimination
in &quot;gay rights&quot; jurisdictions such as Aspen, Denver,
Boulder and Aurora.  As Justice Scalia put it in his dissent,
&quot;The only denial of equal treatment [the Court] contends
homosexuals have suffered is this:  They may not obtain preferential
treatment without amending the state constitution.&quot;  He also
said, &quot;The Court has no business imposing upon all Americans
the resolution favored by the elite class from which the members
of this institution are selected, pronouncing that animosity toward
homosexuality...is evil.&quot;  Note that Justice Scalia did not
say animosity toward homosexuals.  In singling out the behavioral
characteristic in question, Scalia correctly reflected the Christian
view of loving the sinner but hating the sin. The state should
never give preferential treatment on the basis of  behavior that
has been discouraged in all major cultures for thousands of years
and by all major religions.

<p>

<h4>The court cited some previous case law in its decision.  Isn't
this a well-founded ruling?</h4>

<p>

The court, indeed, cited some cases in which legal protections
have been extended to particular groups that are not officially
&quot;suspect&quot; classes but are &quot;identifiable&quot; groups.
But, overall, the opinion was so legally impoverished that it
had to be fashioned, as Scalia remarked,  &quot;so long on emotive
utterance and so short on relevant legal citation.&quot;  The
court's opinion fails to address <I>Bowers v. Hardwick</I>, the
1986 case in which the court ruled that there is no constitutional
protection for homosexuality.  So if it is legal to criminalize
the act of sodomy, then why can't a state decline to extend special
protections for a class of people whose only defining characteristic
is that they practice sodomy?

<p>

<h4>Doesn't Amendment 2 take away the civil rights of homosexuals?</h4>

<p>

No. It just prohibits the addition of special rights that others
do not have.  As Justice Scalia wrote, &quot;The Colorado Amendment
does not, to speak entirely precisely, prohibit giving favored
status to people who are homosexuals; they can be favored for
many reasons -- for example, because they are senior citizens
or members of racial minorities.  But it prohibits them favored
status <I>because of their homosexual conduct</I>....(italics
in original)&quot;

<p>

In other words, homosexuals were in no danger of losing any civil
rights despite press accounts that incorrectly say that Amendment
2 &quot;strips homosexuals of their civil rights.&quot;  They
just could not gain new rights based solely on their predilection
to practice homosexuality.

<p>

<h4>The court ruled that no rational basis could be found to justify
Amendment Two.  What's wrong with that?</h4>

<p>

Ignoring numerous examples of how &quot;sexual orientation&quot;
protections can be wielded against ordinary citizens, the court
essentially concluded that the Colorado people's sole reason for
enacting Amendment 2 was an &quot;animus&quot; toward homosexuals.
This means the court is calling more than 800,000 Coloradans
&quot;hate-filled bigots&quot; and declaring that they had no
rational basis whatever for approving the amendment.  It also
means that God-fearing people in all major religions who believe
homosexuality is wrong are now deemed to be outside the realm
of decency.  This is a sweeping condemnation of the deeply-held
beliefs of billions of people around the world.

<p>

<h4>The court said that gay rights are not &quot;special rights.&quot;
Why do you say they are?</h4>

<p>

Homosexuals have the same rights all citizens have.  They have
the same redress that all citizens have if they face discrimination.
They want an extra level of preferential treatment that would
allow them to cite their homosexuality anytime they do not get
what they want -- a job, a promotion, whatever.  People who commit
adultery do not have such a right.  People who abuse drugs do
not have such a right.  In fact, nobody else has the right to
insist that their behavior is irrelevant to an employer.  &quot;Gay
rights&quot; laws are a massive club with which to beat everyone
else into acceding to homosexuals' increasingly strident demands
for mandated acceptance.  As social critic David Frum writes,
&quot;Antidiscrimination law may invoke the language of rights
and freedoms, but its true function is to shrink the ambit of
freedom in order to promote equality.  The landlady who does not
want to rent an apartment to a tenant whose habits and friends
frighten her; the hardware store owner who wants to hire someone
he regards as trustworthy -- new antidiscrimination rules shrink
even further the liberty of these people to use their property
as they see fit or to hire whom they like.&quot;[3]

<p>

<h4>Can you give some examples of this?</h4>

<p><ul>

<li>In Ontario, Canada, the mayor of Hamilton was personally fined
$5,000 for running afoul of that city's human rights ordinance
that includes sexual orientation.  His crime?  He declined to
issue a special proclamation that the city would celebrate a &quot;gay
pride week.&quot;[4] The mayor in no way threatened the rights of
homosexuals, but was personally punished for failing to use his
city office to celebrate homosexuality.

<p>

<li>The Boy Scouts of America have been under severe legal attack
by homosexual activists in states that have &quot;gay rights&quot;
laws.[5] Their crime? They updheld their 80-year-old moral tradition
that bans openly homosexual men from becoming leaders over young
boys.

<p>

<li>In San Fernando, California, Superior Court Judge John Farrell
was told by other judges in 1995 that he should quit his activities
as a parent volunteer for the Boy Scouts or resign from the bench.
His crime?  The Scouts &quot;discriminate&quot; on the basis
of sexual orientation, which is a protected category under California's
&quot;gay rights&quot; law. A proposed judicial rule would also
ban participation by judges in any group that discriminates on
the basis of sexual orientation.  So Farrell's volunteer work
with the Boy Scouts is a violation of  &quot;judicial ethics.&quot;[6]

<p>

<li>In Seattle, Washington, a small-business employer, Bryan Griggs,
was hauled before the city's human rights board.  His crime?
He allegedly violated the rights of a homosexual employee whom
he had laid off.  The employer did not know the employee was gay.
The employer had had to lay off the entire staff during a downturn.
The employee's claim to &quot;discrimination&quot; consisted
of his employer's playing Christian talk radio on which ads for
the business were running (this constituted a &quot;hate&quot;
crime), posting a letter from a Congresswoman regarding the 
gays-in-the-military issue, and having a note on his desk that he wrote 
to himself regarding homosexuals and adoption of children.  After spending
thousands of dollars defending himself, Griggs saw the case finally
dismissed for lack of substance.[7]  But the point was made to other
employers --  mess with any homosexual employee or would-be employee
and you will be legally harassed.

</ul><p>

<center><h3>SUMMARY</h3></center>

<p>

In striking down Amendment 2, the court ignored a wealth of case
law, twisted the meaning of the Constitution, ignored the reality
of homosexual behavior, and intervened heavily on the side of
homosexual activism against those who believe that homosexuality
is wrong.

<p>

Justice Scalia summed up the case by writing, &quot;Today's opinion
has no foundation in American constitutional law, and barely pretends
to.  The people of Colorado have adopted an entirely reasonable
provision which does not even disfavor homosexuals in any substantive
sense, but merely denies them preferential treatment.  Amendment
2 is designed to prevent piecemeal deterioration of the sexual
morality favored by a majority of Coloradans, and is not only
an appropriate means to that legitimate end, but a means that
Americans have employed before.  Striking it down is an act, not
of judicial judgment, but of political will.&quot;

<p>

In the face of an increasingly strident homosexual rights movement,
the court has declared war on the beliefs of millions of ordinary
Americans.

<p>

This is the real message of &quot;gay rights&quot; -- affirm what
we do or we will use legal means to harass you.  Americans who
want to stay neutral will soon find that this is a stance that
homosexual activists -- and now the Supreme Court -- will not
afford them.

<h2>STORM CLOUDS OR A DRIZZLE?<br>
A LOOK AT A NEW STUDY ON<br>
CHILD CARE</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

The National Institutes of Child
Health and Human Development (NICHD) recently released the initial
findings of a new child care study &quot;and fired the shot
heard round the world.&quot;  In this long-term study that plans
to track the effects of child care on children's development
through 7 years of age, the results of phase one rendered a body
blow to mothers choosing to provide full-time care for their babies.
Within days, the <I>Los Angeles Times</I> headlines read &quot;Child
Care No Risk to Infant-Mother Ties,&quot; and <I>The Guardian</I>
reported, &quot;Child Care Report Backs Working Mums.&quot;
Meanwhile, mothers here and abroad tried to make sense of a study
that implied &quot;other care&quot; was as good as &quot;mother
care,&quot; at least in terms of a baby's attachment relationship
with his or her mother.

<p>

<center><h3>THE MEANING OF ATTACHMENT</h3></center>

<p>

Just what is meant by the term &quot;attachment?&quot;
In his l969 book <I>Attachment,</I> the late British psychiatrist
John Bowlby wrote about the centrality of the baby's attachment
to his mother which he believed was &quot;the foundation stone
of personality.&quot;[1] Bowlby added that a &quot;young child's
hunger for his mother's love and presence is as great as
his hunger for food&quot; and that &quot;her absence inevitably
generates a powerful sense of loss and anger.&quot;[2] Freud would
agree with Bowlby on the importance of the mother or mothering
figure in the child's early life.  Writing in <I>An Outline
of Psychoanalysis</I>, he described the relationship a child has
with his mother as &quot;unique, without parallel, established
unalterably for a whole lifetime as the first and strongest love
object and as the prototype of all later love relations -- for
both sexes.&quot;[3]

<p>

The formation of attachment -- or
the emotional bond between a mother and her baby -- is a critical
developmental milestone during the first year of life.  In fact,
psychologists Alan Sroufe and Everett Waters call this enduring
bond a &quot;psychological tether which binds infant and caregiver
together.&quot;[4] From his earliest attachments, first to mother,
then to father, a baby develops a sense of his own worthiness,
conscience, and the capacity for intimacy in later significant
relationships.[5] He also learns -- generally by 12 months of age
-- whether or not he can trust his mother to meet his
physical and emotional needs.  If his mother is sensitive, consistent
and responsive in meeting his myriad needs, he is likely to be
securely attached to her.  If she is unpredictable in her ministrations
or rejecting, then the  mother and her baby will tend to develop
an insecure emotional bond or attachment.

<p>

<center><h3>THE NICHD STUDY</h3></center>

<p>

Just what did the NICHD-supported
scientists discover about the effects of child care on a baby's
attachment to his mother?  The study, which has followed 1,300
families at l0 different sites since 1991, found that child care,
<I>in and of itself</I>, does not harm the baby's emotional
bond with his mother.[6] Indeed, the researchers state that the
type of child care, the quality of care, the number of hours per
week in care and even the age the baby enters care do not create
an insecure attachment.  With this ammunition, the media heralded
the current study as a challenge to, or even  repudiation of,
earlier infant day care research, as well as a blanket endorsement
of child care for employed mothers.  Upon examination, however,
the NICHD study does not quite deliver the broadside to on-site
mothering that the media contends.  In fact, it contains some
important caveats to the central finding that child care neither
helps nor hurts the baby's attachment relationship to his
mother.

<p>

For example, the NICHD researchers
found that if a baby was unlucky enough to have an &quot;insensitive
mother,&quot; then the child care variables mattered.  Thus,
the &quot;dual risk&quot; of an insensitive mother <I>plus</I> 
poor quality child care, <I>or</I> inconsistency of care,
<I>or</I> more than l0 hours per week in care increased the likelihood
that a baby would be insecurely attached to his mother. While
the study did not contain a profile of the insensitive mother
(whether she was divorced, employed, stressed, and lonely, or
married, at home, financially strapped, and depressed), it did
find, as one would expect, that a sensitive mother who was well-adjusted
psychologically was more likely to have a securely attached child
than her insensitive counterpart.

<p>

The NICHD study also found significant
gender differences in terms of the effects of child care on attachment
security.  Infant boys who spent <I>more than</I> 30 hours per
week in child care were at risk for insecure attachment while
girls who spent <I>less than</I> 10 hours per week in care were
&quot;somewhat&quot; more likely to be insecurely attached
to their mothers.  Psychologist Jay Belsky of Pennsylvania State
University, one of the study's researchers, explained these
particular findings this way:  &quot;Separation might prove
stressful for boys, but girls who are at home with mothers extensively
may become too close and enmeshed.&quot;[7] Belsky's interpretation
prompted <I>Washington Times</I> columnist Suzanne Fields to write,
&quot;In other words, mommies who spend a lot of time with their
infant daughters are dangerous to their daughters' mental
health.&quot;[8]

<p>

Additionally, the NICHD study found
that a mother's belief system affected her baby's
attachment security. Those mothers who believed that maternal
employment actually &quot;benefited&quot; their babies'
development placed their children in child care earlier and for
more hours than did those mothers who held &quot;weaker&quot;
beliefs.  Those mothers who felt child care was harmful to their
children but used it anyway tended to have more securely attached
children than their less anxious counterparts.

<p>

How to explain this apparent conundrum?
While some may wonder about the negative psychological implications
of being riven by guilt and anxiety, Belsky suggests, &quot;It
may be that some guilt and anxiety keeps you alert, vigilant and
able to monitor the quality of care.  Being cavalier about the
effects of work turns out to be risky.&quot;[9]

<p>

<center><h3>THE NICHD FINDINGS AND THE ONGOING INFANT DAY CARE 
DEBATE</h3></center>

<p>

Why were the NICHD findings so provocative?
The findings, as <I>The Guardian</I> so aptly stated,
&quot;go to the heart of an enduringly bitter debate&quot;
about the effects of child care on a baby's emotional security
during that critical first year of life.[10] This debate affects
a huge number of American families and touches on an emotion-laden
issue:  How best to raise America's children.  Not only
do more than half the mothers of infants under one year of age
participate in the work force, but in this particular study more
than half of the infants were in some form of child care for more
than 30 hours per week by the end of their first year.[11] In addition,
the NICHD study flies in the face of accumulated evidence since
the early 1980s, which  found that placing a baby in substitute
care, even good quality care, for 20 or more hours per week during
that critical first year, not only increased the baby's
risk of insecure attachment to mother and/or father, but also
was often the harbinger of behavioral and emotional problems later
on.

<p>

<center><h3>EARLIER INFANT DAY CARE RESEARCH</h3></center>

<p>

For example, in l988 researchers
Jay Belsky and Michael Rovine evaluated the effects of child care
on 491 infants and found that those who experienced 20 or more
hours per week of nonmaternal care during the first year of life
were more likely to be classified as insecurely attached to their
mothers than those who spent less time in care.  In l989,
psychologist  Alison Clarke-Stewart found similar results in
her analysis of 1,247 infants.[12]

<p>

When researchers looked at the long-term
effects of infant day care, they often discovered that early entry
into day care signaled later behavioral and emotional problems.
Evidence from as early as the mid-1970s indicates that children
who began child care during their first year were more physically
and verbally aggressive with peers and adults, less cooperative,
and less able to handle frustrations than those who started care
thereafter.[13] For instance, a l985 study at the University of North
Carolina found that children who entered child care during their
first year were more likely to &quot;hit, kick and push other
children&quot; as kindergartners and first-graders than those
who began care later on.[14] In light of these and other findings,
it is not surprising that a full scale ideological war is in progress,
or that the current study produced such a rousing and widespread
media response.

<p>

<center><h3>WHAT THE NEWSPAPERS DID NOT REPORT</h3></center>

<p>

As a psychologist who has followed
the child care debate since the early 1980s, what struck me about
the current study were the findings that never made the newspapers,
namely these statistics:

<p><ul>

<li>About 42 percent of male infants were insecurely attached to 
their mothers when they worked more than 30 hours per week.  (This 
is a hefty number in light of proven male vulnerability to psychological 
and behavioral problems).

<p>

<li>When insensitive mothers placed their babies with insensitive 
caregivers, 56 percent of the babies were insecurely attached -- an 
obvious double-whammy for the babies.

<p>

<li>If insensitive mothers placed their babies in child care for more 
than 10 hours per week, between 46-48 percent were insecurely attached 
to their mothers.  (Evidence that simply placing a child in day care 
for more hours does not eradicate the need for time with mother, even 
when she's relatively insensitive.)

<p>

<li>When insensitive mothers placed their children in more than one 
child care situation, 44 percent were insecurely attached.  (This 
shows that inconsistent care coupled with an unresponsive mother is 
hazardous to attachment security.)

</ul><p>

These statistics gain significance
when we realize that in cross-cultural attachment research using
the Strange Situation-- the laboratory experiment developed by
psychologist Mary Ainsworth and her colleagues and used by researchers
in the NICHD study to determine attachment security -- about 35
percent of the infants are insecurely attached to their mothers.[15]
In most of the analyses in the current study, the rate of attachment
insecurity among the children is between 42 and 56 percent.  This
difference is not insignificant when translated into emotional
insecurity in children's lives.

<p>

<center><h3>MALE VULNERABILITY</h3></center>

<p>

The findings about infant male attachment
insecurity are particularly noteworthy since previous research
has found that males are generally more vulnerable than females
to a host of physiological and psychological ills.  Not only are
males more susceptible than females to speech, learning and behavioral
difficulties, but they are three to five times more likely to
have reading problems.[16] In the arena of emotional disorders, more
males than females suffer from night terrors, hyperactivity, and
autism.  Moreover, adolescent males have a higher incidence of
schizophrenia, delinquency, academic underachievement, and suicide
than females.  According to psychologist Dee Shepherd-Look, &quot;Until
adulthood, it is difficult to find a pathological condition in
which the incidence among females is higher than among males.&quot;[17]

<p>

What happens when mother returns
to the work force?  Researchers Belsky and Rovine found that,
in terms of attachment security, if a mother worked more than
35 hours per week during the baby's first year of life,
50 percent of the sons were more likely to be insecurely attached
to their fathers.[18] A 1987 study by P. Lindsay Chase-Lansdale and
Margaret Owen found similar results.[19] Also, studies of elementary
school children have discovered that boys are more likely than
girls to suffer when mother works outside the home.[20] In light
of earlier and current research, it is reasonable to suggest that
mothers of sons think long and hard about working full-time during
their babies' vulnerable first year of life.

<p>

<center><h3>HIGH QUALITY CARE AND THE INSENSITIVE MOTHER</h3></center>

<p>

As for the insensitive mother and
her baby, the NICHD researchers found that high quality child
care did not entirely compensate for a mother's relative
unresponsiveness.  This was the opposite of what they expected
to find.  In other words, if a baby had an insensitive mother,
the researchers hypothesized that it would be better for that
baby to spend more time away from her in the care of a sensitive
caregiver.  But this did not, in fact, prove true.  Instead, if
the insensitive mother worked part-time rather than full-time,
then her baby was more likely to be securely attached to her (65
percent vs. 56 percent secure, respectively).  This finding supports
the idea that high quality day care does not compensate for mother
care, even when a mother is relatively insensitive.

<p>

It's important to pause at
this point and ask ourselves just how many mothers, some of whom
may be  practicing &quot;defensive careerism,&quot; are able
to be genuinely sensitive and responsive to their babies'
cries and bids for attention, particularly if these mothers are
harried or super-stressed by the multiple demands of their lives?
How is a mother to know for sure that she is creating a secure
emotional bond with her baby as she goes off to work for 10-12
hours per day?  Even this study found that working more than 10
hours per week (that's a mere  two hours per day) puts
the child of the insensitive mother at risk for insecure attachment.
Unless a woman is confident that she is a sensitive mother who
is creating a strong, secure emotional bond with her baby, it
may be wise to err on the side of quantity rather than quality
time during the baby's first year of life.

<p>

<center><h3>CONCERNS ABOUT THE DATA</h3></center>

<p>

A careful review of the NICHD study,
arouses some very real concerns.  First, 20 of the 25 researchers
are women.  Since all scientific study is, to some extent, contaminated
by bias, there is reason to wonder just how many of these researchers
relied on day care for their own children and may, therefore,
have a personal stake in the report's outcome.  In other words,
is the methodology or even the interpretation of the data, in
this instance, subject to serious bias?  When I posed this question
to psychologist Martha Cox of the University of North Carolina,
one of the study's researchers, she admitted, &quot;Most
of us have used early and extensive child care for our children.&quot;
She said that both of her children had been in child care since
they were two months of age.  But she was quick to add, &quot;If
we tried to get value-free researchers, we wouldn't have
anybody doing research.&quot;

<p>

That this issue is not a red herring
is evident in the article written by Dr. Jay Belsky for <I>Zero
to Three</I> in l986 that set off a firestorm among some
of the researchers involved in the NICHD study.  In this article
entitled &quot;Infant Day Care:  A Cause for Concern,&quot;
Belsky not only reviewed disturbing evidence on the effects of
early and extensive child care but admitted that scientists must
struggle to maintain an open mind when it comes to controversial
and emotion-laden issues. He stated, &quot;I am well aware, too,
that my <I>gender</I> and the more or less <I>traditional nature
of my family structure</I> (italics mine) could bias the reading
of the evidence.&quot;[21]

<p>

So how did the NICHD researchers
attempt to control for bias?  While Cox stated that the data were
coded in a central location (The University of Washington in Seattle)
and not by the individual researchers themselves, Belsky told
me in an interview that those who coded  the data knew this was
a study of child care.  &quot;If they erred, they erred on the
side of finding attachment security,&quot; he said.  Then he
added, &quot;If there's bias it could be the readiness
to embrace the finding that kids aren't affected by child
care -- to give the green light to child care.  If this were a
study of cocaine use and researchers found the same effects, who
would say cocaine use doesn't matter?&quot;

<p>

Additionally, the study examined
a mother's attitudes about the &quot;benefit&quot; of
maternal employment on her baby's development and found
that mothers torn by guilt and anxiety were more likely to have
securely attached babies.  Just what are we to surmise from this?
Does this finding imply that it is okay for mothers to be in
turmoil over their employment decisions as long as their babies
are emotionally secure?  As a therapist who works almost exclusively
with women, I would  suggest that it is hardly a positive for
mothers to have their hearts divided.  Over time, guilt and anxiety
tend to produce depression, and no child profits from having a
depressed mother.

<p>

I am also concerned that the NICHD
researchers examined a mother's attitudes when her baby
was one month old.  Mothers often dramatically change their attitudes
toward separation from their babies over the course of the first
six months after delivery.  In my own doctoral research on adult
attachment and attitudes toward employment conducted at Georgetown
University, I interviewed 89 new mothers two to three days after
they had delivered their firstborn infants and then again four
months later.[22] Not surprisingly, I found that over the course
of four months a number of the women had changed their attitudes
about leaving their babies to return to work.  It was not unusual
for them to say that they had fallen in love with their babies
and could not bear to leave them.

<p>

Finally, since much of the attachment
research using the Strange Situation has looked at a baby's
attachment relationship with his parents when he was 12 months
old, and then again at 18 months to track the stability of the
attachment classification, just why did the NICHD researchers
elect to study the babies at l5 months of age? If this &quot;largest,
longest, and most comprehensive study yet&quot; is to challenge
and even repudiate earlier findings, then why not examine the
mother-baby attachment relationship at the usual 12-month marker?
When asked about this, Dr. Cox said, &quot;We were using other
measures at 15 months and so using the Strange Situation then
was optimal for everything.&quot;  She added, &quot;There's
lots of stability (in attachment patterns) in the 12-18 month
range, though there's always a possibility that things
could change developmentally.&quot;  When asked if this difference
in the research design might have affected the study's
outcome, Belsky replied that the researchers had debated this
issue and reached a &quot;compromise solution.&quot;  Yet one
is left with a feeling of nagging doubt.  In the changing world
of infancy and the forging of emotional bonds, do these three
extra months make a significant difference?

<p>

<center><h3>FINAL THOUGHTS</h3></center>

<p>

Whatever questions the study raises,
in the final analysis, it affirms the importance of mothering.
The study shows that  a mother's sensitivity to her baby
is the most significant predictor of attachment security.  While
it is obviously better for a baby to have a sensitive, well-adjusted
mother, even the presence of an insensitive mother is important
for her baby's attachment security.  Moreover, high quality
care does not eradicate a baby's need for extensive time
with his mother even when  she is relatively unresponsive to his
cues and bids for attention.  In fact, for the insensitive mother
and her child, the NICHD  study affirms the value of part-time
over full-time employment.  Additionally, it  found  that a mother's
attitudes toward employment are crucial in terms of her baby's
attachment security.

<p>

But does this NICHD study categorically
endorse &quot;other care&quot; for babies as the media would
have us believe?  Does it relieve the employed mother's
guilt?  Are we to assume that placing babies in early and extensive
child care carries no significant risk?  As we ponder the findings
of the NICHD study, we need to remember that those researchers
have looked at only one aspect of child development -- attachment.
They have yet to examine children's development in terms
of aggression, social skills, health, capacity for empathy or
intellectual competence.  These qualities will be examined when
the children are 3 and 4 years old.  Since aggression is well
established by age 3 and has been one of the long-term effects
of early and extensive child care, the researchers may find that
the insecurely attached children in this  study are more likely
to be disobedient to adults and bully their peers.  Or they may
not.  Unfortunately, it will be several years before we learn
what these early and provocative findings mean.

<p>

As Belsky said when interviewed,
&quot;It's too early to tell. In my early observations,
lots of child care posed a risk factor. In this study, even more
than 10 hours of care was important. It's the most vulnerable
children who are the most adversely affected.&quot;  In terms
of policy implications, he added, &quot;To presume that the
data carry policy implications at this point is to make decisions
after reading the first chapter of a novel.&quot;  Then changing
his image, Belsky said, &quot;The study shows it's drizzling
now.  It could be a cloud cover or it could be the leading edge
of a storm. We just don't know.&quot;

<p>

As we await later results, we would
do well to look beyond the realm of social science research  to
the cultural landscape where we find other evidence -- disquieting
evidence -- that also merits our consideration.  The indicators
are that children in this country are not faring well.  Increasingly,
we read about acts of rage and violence committed by young children
-- children seemingly without a conscience.  For example, a 6-year-old
boy was recently arrested in Richmond, California, for the attempted
murder of a 6-month-old baby.  (Ironically, his mother works in
a child care agency.)  In Englewood, Colorado, a 10-year-old boy
is being held for fatally beating a 19-month-old girl he was babysitting.
In Lucerne Valley, California, two boys and girls, ages 11 and
12, were arrested for attempting to murder their teacher.[23] Whence
this anger and rage?  How can we begin to understand such violence
in the hearts of some of our nation's children except in
the context of their intimate parental attachments?

<p>

As we continue to make our daily
decisions about how best to rear our very young children and attempt
to understand the results of  scientific study, it may be that
we are doing so, not in a drizzle or even in a storm, but in the
all-too-quiet eye of a hurricane.

<h2>FEDERAL DRUG WAR<br>
IGNORING GREAT ALLY:<br>
FAITH-BASED TREATMENT</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>

<p>

Treating addicts is an important part of the nation's drug war.
When abusers are in treatment they aren't committing crimes, and
after treatment some never return to their formerly destructive
ways. Unfortunately, only a small percentage of addicts seek treatment,
usually as part of their punishment, and treatment programs are
limited. More significantly, the government is actively discouraging
some of the most effective programs.

<p>

Faith-based drug treatment programs consistently produce the highest
&quot;cure&quot; rates in the country. In spite of high success
rates and zero cost to taxpayers, the government has often stiff-armed
these programs.

<p><ul>

<li>The Texas Commission of Alcohol and Drug Abuse (TCADA) tried
to shut down faith-based Victory Outreach, which is a rehabilitation
program run by former addicts. Outreach founder Freddie Garcia
said, &quot;We don't use drugs or psychiatrists or any of that,
only Bible study.&quot;[1] Garcia claims a 70 percent success rate
for his privately funded program, while government programs cure
less than 10 percent of their clients and cost hundreds of dollars
per day. He explained, &quot;We believe that sin is the reason
why people take drugs....We believe that the drug addict is a
slave to sin, not to drugs. We believe that drug addiction is
a spiritual problem, and that Jesus Christ is the solution.&quot;[2]
House Speaker Newt Gingrich said, &quot;Freddie Garcia has achieved
results that are almost unheard of....All too often the bureaucracy
has tried to put folks like Freddie out of business because they
don't have a Ph.D., or they don't fill out the paperwork right...instead,
they run very inexpensive neighborhood programs that feel more
comfortable to people on the street.&quot;[3]

<p>

<li>Teen Challenge of South Texas was almost shut down by TCADA.
Like Garcia's organization, Teen Challenge is a faith-based program
with cure rates of 70 to 85 percent.[4] Teen Challenge has been successfully
treating drug addicts since its founding in 1958. TCADA said that
to get a treatment license Teen Challenge must employ psychiatrists,
masters of social work, certified counselors and other professionals.
It must also embrace a &quot;medical&quot; model for treatment of drug abuse
which presumes that addiction is a disease.[5] But in contrast, Teen
Challenge views addiction as a sin symptomatic of a life out-of-touch
with the teachings of Jesus Christ. Under a &quot;religious&quot;
model, drug addiction is viewed as eminently curable through the
teachings of Christ.

</ul><p>

Robert L. Woodson, Sr., founder and president of the National
Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, says faith-based programs
aren't looking for government funds. They &quot;just [want] to
be left to do [their] Christian work...but...officials...insist
you've got to be certified by the state and comply with rules,
like having a 36-inch door rather than a 34-inch door....The government
officials cling to their regulations, and kids who might be rescued
are sleeping in crack houses or under...bridges.&quot;[6]

<p>

Faith-based programs may not work for everyone, but they are part
of a diverse range of programs fighting addiction. That's why
on May 2, 1996, Texas Governor George W. Bush set up a task force
to study how faith-based community service programs can further
help. The 17-member task force's goal &quot;is to identify ways
that Texas can create an environment where faith-based organizations
will flourish and meet the needs of people in crisis with focused
and effective aid,&quot;[7] said Bush. The task force includes Victory
Outreach's Freddie Garcia and J. Herbert Meppelink, the executive
director of Teen Challenge of South Texas.

<p>

Texas is blazing the trail for the entire nation showing how 
financially-strapped governments can encourage faith-based programs that 
have a long history of meeting critical needs. Unfortunately, the faith 
community and government regulators often disagree over the nature of 
the problem.

<p>

<center><h3>TWO SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT</h3></center>

<p>

There are two major schools of thought about the root causes of
drug addiction. Some argue that it is a disease and should be
treated as such. Others say drug addicts are people whose lives
have gone wrong.

<p>

Many treatment specialists would agree that drug use leading to
addiction is a moral choice and that long-term abuse has physiological
implications. After all, smoking the first marijuana cigarette
or snorting the first line of cocaine is a choice, and there is
medical evidence that increased abuse can lead to addiction which
can have serious, disease-like consequences.

<p>

Hiring a prostitute is analogous to using illicit drugs because
both actions begin with a moral choice and both may cause serious
damage. The sex customer makes a moral decision by hiring a prostitute,
and as a result he may contract a sexually-transmitted disease
(STD) and contribute to crime and to the destruction of his family
and reputation.

<p>

The sex offender can be treated for his disease (the STD), but
unless something is done about his morally-based decision-making
mechanism, he may continue to engage in high-risk and morally
depraved behavior. He needs help to heal both his sexual disease
and his decision-making mechanism.

<p>

Drug addicts also need help with the adverse health consequences
of abuse and with making moral choices. But not everyone agrees
with the dual nature of addiction and its treatment.

<p>

At least one government agency adheres to the disease model. Since
its establishment in 1974, the National Institute on Drug Abuse
(NIDA) has been the lead federal agency for drug abuse research,
looking for causes and effects of drug abuse. It oversees 90 percent
of all funding for drug addiction research nationwide such as
medication research and the new and noninvasive positron emission
tomography (PET) technology which makes it possible to see where
illicit drugs affect the brain. NIDA says that drug addiction
is &quot;a complex disease that can be successfully addressed
by scientific research.&quot;[8]

<p>

There are many non-government treatment specialists who agree.
David E. Smith, a longtime treatment expert and founder of the
Haight Asbury Free Clinics in San Francisco, says that the medical
protocol of his clinics is &quot;the study and treatment of addictive
disease, characterized by the compulsive use of drugs, often with
major physical, psychological and behavioral consequences....Anybody
is liable for addiction, although some are more liable than others.
If your father is an alcoholic, then your son has a four times
higher probability of developing the disease.&quot;[9] This view
suggests that alcohol addiction is genetically predisposed, an
as yet unproven theory.

<p>

Gabriel G. Nahas, professor of anesthesiology at the College of
Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University, writes in <i>A
Manual on Drug Dependence</i> that drug dependence is &quot;[r]eversible
and transient at first...[but] after repetitive drug use&quot;
addiction becomes &quot;irreversible and lead[s] to brain pathology
[disease].&quot;[10]

<p>

One of the classic rationales for labeling addiction a disease
is that it encourages abusers to seek help because there is a
lessened sense of guilt. The fact, however, is that most people
in treatment are there because of a run-in with the law and not
because of a desire to go straight. Unfortunately, the disease
approach allows abusers to ignore or explain away their moral
accountability, and consequently addicts perceive themselves as
victims.

<p>

There is a vast but often unheralded faith-based treatment community
that disagrees with the disease model. They argue that addiction
is a reflection of underlying moral or spiritual problems. Teen
Challenge, the largest faith-based treatment network with 120
centers nationwide, argues that addictions are a &quot;manifestation
of larger problems brought about by sin and self-centered attempts
to find meaning and fulfillment in life....When one does not have
a personal relationship with Christ's person, [he] has profound
emptiness that is often filled with misguided and self-destructive
efforts to achieve happiness.&quot;[11] Faith-based treatment will
be discussed in detail later, but first consider a profile of
American drug treatment.

<p>

<center><h3>DRUG ADDICTION TREATMENT</h3></center>

<p>

Many in the medical profession have embraced the disease model,
and this has influenced the available treatment modalities. Psychiatrists
are the primary caregivers for addicts and their manual, the American
Psychiatric Association's diagnostic manual (DSM-IV), defines
substance dependence (addiction) as a disease. The DSM describes
addiction by the following symptoms: (1) compulsion or loss of
control; (2) tolerance, withdrawal reactions and using the drug
to avoid or interrupt withdrawal reactions and (3) impairment and 
preoccupation with the drug to the exclusion of all pleasures and activities.[12]

<p>

Addiction disease is most often treated using one or more of the
following modalities: detoxification, pharmacological treatment,
therapeutic communities, chemical dependency treatment programs,
and outpatient, drug-free treatment like 12-step programs.

<p>

Detoxification is the process of withdrawal of the drug under
supervision. Unfortunately, most detoxified addicts soon return
to the drug if other support treatment is not provided.[13]

<p>

Methadone maintenance is the most popular pharmacological treatment
for heroin addiction. There are at least 110,000 Americans enrolled
in government-sanctioned methadone programs lasting perhaps 12
months or longer. Methadone maintenance substitutes one addiction
(heroin) for another (methadone) requiring doses once a day. It
prevents withdrawal symptoms and stabilizes the addict. Methadone
patients live more productive lives than heroin addicts.[14] A 1991
NIDA-sponsored study of six methadone programs found that 82 percent
of subjects who left treatment relapsed within a year.[15]

<p>

There are a number of alternatives to methadone such as Naltrexone
and Buprenorphine. NIDA recently developed and the Food and Drug
Administration approved a longer-acting variant of methadone,
levo-alpha-acetylmethadol (LAAM). It needs to be taken only once
every 72 hours. There are other drug regimes for alcohol addicts
(antabuse) and cocaine addicts (amantadine, bromocriptine and
fluphenthixol decanoate).[16]

<p>

There are more than 500 residential therapeutic community (TC)
programs accommodating up to 15,000 patients annually. These programs
are primarily publicly funded. Seventy-five percent of the patients
have arrest records and are unemployed. TCs provide a strict environment
with group therapy where former addicts are the counselors. Drug
abuse is considered a disease of the emotions, and the patient
needs to be resocialized. Patients remain in residence up to a
year.[17]

<p>

Chemical dependency treatment programs differ from TCs in the
kind of patients, the length of the program and the level of professional
control. The Betty Ford Center for Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation
is an example where management and housekeeping are in the hands
of paid professionals and workers. Patients pay (hundreds of dollars
per day) for the treatment, stay for about a month and receive
care directed by a medical and mental health team. These facilities
care for about 10,000 people annually.[18]

<p>

Finally, outpatient drug treatment is the most common modality.
It includes 12-step programs which are not physician run and rely
on personal faith. Many people who have gone through other programs
will participate in a 12-step group for long-term help. The process
involves admitting powerlessness, seeking help from God, praying
that God will remove shortcomings, making a moral inventory, seeking
forgiveness, making amends, and helping others. Drug abstinence
is the goal, and participants are expected to attend meetings
daily.

<p>

<center><h3>THE DRUG TREATMENT INDUSTRY</h3></center>

<p>

The drug treatment industry can't meet the demand. The 1996 National
Drug Control Strategy claims that there are 11,800 specialty drug
abuse and alcoholism treatment facilities (both public and private)
for 7.1 million Americans who need treatment. But in 1994, only
1.85 million of the most severely addicted actually received treatment.
Most (62 percent) addicted Americans are men and employed (51
percent) with incomes (55 percent) less than twice the poverty level. 
Their lives are marked by criminal behavior, they rely on welfare assistance,
they lack health insurance, and they tend to be young (many under
age 18).[19]

<p>

Much of the recent public sector treatment growth has been within
the judicially-controlled population. In 1993, an estimated 944,208
people under custody of correctional agencies were also clients
in a drug and or alcoholism treatment program.[20] Of that number,
17 percent (160,573) were in non-government-funded treatment programs.
Most of the government (87.2 percent) and private (94 percent)
clients were in outpatient treatment.[21]

<p>

Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is the most common &quot;treatment&quot;
modality. In 1995, there were 50,671 known AA groups and 1,150,447
national members.[22] These numbers do not include other 12-step programs
such as Narcotics Anonymous, Al-A-Teen and at least 629 Christian-based
programs.[23]

<p>

<center><h3>DRUG TREATMENT COSTS</h3></center>

<p>

Public-sponsored drug treatment is very expensive. The federal
government will spend $5 billion in 1997 treating mostly 
economically-strapped and criminal addicts.[24] A 1992 National Drug and 
Alcohol Treatment Utilization Survey found 945,000 clients involved in 
federally-funded drug abuse treatment. Most (87 percent) were treated as 
outpatients.[25]

<p>

Federal treatment dollars have grown substantially over the past
five years. From 1989 to 1994 federal drug treatment funds increased
119 percent (or $1.3 billion), but the number of persons treated
has declined while the treatment demands have risen.[26]

<p>

Federal funding of treatment programs generally lacks strict accountability.
In 1996, there were 13 federal agencies that allocated treatment
funds to the states using a variety of mechanisms.[27] A percentage
of those funds are siphoned off for administrative costs at each
government level beginning in Washington, D.C.

<p>

Consider the funds California received from the Substance Abuse
and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) last year.
[SAMHSA is the source of 30 percent of federal funding for drug
abuse treatment and prevention.[28] ] The state took 5 percent for
administrative costs then negotiated with each of the 58 counties
which are responsible for providing treatment programs. But there
is no accountability mechanism. Perhaps that's why the state government
hired the University of California to study whether publicly-funded
treatment programs work. The report is due next year.[29]

<p>

<center><h3>DOES TREATMENT WORK?</h3></center>

<p>

Determining treatment success can be difficult. The National Drug
Control Strategy lists six treatment success measures: reduced
crime, reduced drug use, reduced domestic violence, reduced behavior
at risk for the AIDS virus, increased days of employment, and
positive change in social values and networks.[30] These indicators
are difficult to measure especially among unreliable addicts.

<p>

A common criticism of drug treatment programs and a good indication
of success is the high rate of addict recidivism. Repeat treatment
is very common and may be attributed to the addict not getting
the appropriate help in the first instance. &quot;There is no
single appropriate treatment for addiction,&quot; says Herbert
D. Kleber, the director of the Division of Substance Abuse, College
of Physicians and Surgeons, Columbia University, &quot;any more
than there is for diabetes, hypertension or depression. These
populations are diverse. Some need medication, some need psychological
help, some need lifestyle change. It is critical to match the
individual with the appropriate treatment.&quot;[31]

<p>

Perhaps Dr. Kleber's warning explains why so many abusers drop
out of treatment. AA has found, for example, that 88 percent of
members drop out within a year, and only 20 to 30 percent remain
abstinent for five or more years.[32]

<p>

Mitchell Rosenthal, president of Phoenix House, one of the nation's
two largest residential drug-treatment organizations, says that
30 percent of residents drop out within the first six weeks and
about half make it through the first year.[33] Most therapeutic communities
like Phoenix House see only 10 percent of their patients complete
the program.[34]

<p>

Finishing Phoenix House's comprehensive 18- to 24-month program
is good insurance against relapse. Rosenthal claims that 90 percent
of his graduates are still working and law-abiding five to seven
years later and that 70 percent stay drug-free.[35]

<p>

Rosenthal sees drug abuse as a symptom of a deeper personal disturbance.
He explains, &quot;We have two years to teach industrial-strength
values to those most likely to resist them -- only two years to instill the 
social competence, self-respect, trust in other people, and optimism about 
the future that the addict's community and family did not.&quot;[36]

<p>

Large treatment outcome studies have found mixed &quot;successes.&quot;
The Drug Abuse Research Project Survey (DARPS), a 12-year follow-up
of heroin addicts admitted to methadone, residential, or outpatient
drug-free treatment began in 1969. It found that 83 percent of
the patients had been treated more than once by the end of the
survey and 74 percent had taken methadone at some time. The Treatment
Outcome Prospective Study (TOPS) followed 10,000 abuse patients
three and five years after treatment. Most (95 percent) of individuals
in residential treatment reported more than minimal drug use before
treatment and a substantial reduction after treatment. Additionally,
of those who reported illegal activity before treatment, 97 percent
reported no illegal activity during treatment and more than half
(57 percent) reported a decrease in depression after treatment.[37]

<p>

In 1994, there was a California study of 1,900 addicts in treatment.
The study found that it wasn't necessary to complete the treatment
to yield a savings. Each day of treatment yielded a financial
return to society. Specifically, it was estimated that for 150,000
treated addicts which cost $209 million, the state saved $1.5
billion in reduced social costs, primarily crime.[38]

<p>

The effectiveness of drug addiction treatment is inconclusive.
But we do know that the best results come from intensive, long-term
programs that involve multiple modalities that target the addict's
specific problems.[39]

<p>

<center><h3>NO TREATMENT OFTEN BEST</h3></center>

<p>

Some argue that there is a high rate of recovery among addicts
even without treatment. Heroin addicts typically break the habit
in 11 years, and half of all alcoholics free themselves without
outside help.[40]

<p>

A study of self-treated alcoholics found that more than half (57
percent) said they simply decided that alcohol was bad for them
and nearly a third (29 percent) said health problems, frightening
experiences, accidents, or blackouts persuaded them to quit.[41]

<p>

A study of heroin addiction among American soldiers who fought
in Vietnam is most revealing. Two to three years after returning
from Vietnam, despite extremely high rates of addiction, they
were no more likely to be addicts than comparable civilians.[42]

<p>

The Vietnam study found that many soldiers were described as heroin
addicts in order to fit the mold of a drug treatment program.
These people had so many other problems, originating before the
addiction, that the label &quot;addict&quot; is little more than
a convenience, and &quot;treatment of drug abuse&quot; is an inadequate
description of their needs.[43]

<p>

<center><h3>A CASE FOR FAITH-BASED PROGRAMS</h3></center>

<p>

There is room for faith-based programs to compete in the treatment
arena, especially given the poor showing by most publicly-funded
programs. After all, faith-based programs rely on the addict's
relationship with God as a primary treatment modus operandi, and
that appeals to many Americans.

<p>

The typical faith-based drug program is structured like the therapeutic
community approach. Both use former addicts as counselors, seek
to resocialize the addict and usually last for one year. The primary
difference is the faith-based program's philosophy. It claims
that a relationship with Jesus Christ provides meaning and direction
for life which is key to a healthy body, mind and spirit.

<p>

In 1996, a <i>USA Today</i> poll found that 56 percent of Americans
believe that faith helped them recover from an illness.[44] Herbert
Benson, author of <i>The Relaxation Response and Timeless Healing:
The Power and Biology of Belief</i>, supports the faith-healing
connection. &quot;To put it simply,&quot; Benson said, &quot;we're
wired for God...We're the only species that knows it's going to
die and has a belief in something beyond. We have a tremendous
healing capacity if we can tap into what I call the 'faith factor.'&quot;[45]

<p>

Dr. Dale Matthews, an associate professor of medicine at Georgetown
University, reviewed 212 medical studies examining faith and health.
He found three out of every four studies showed health benefits
for patients with &quot;religious commitments.&quot;[46]

<p>

Similar results are found in drug-related studies. In a review
of 20 published studies, 19 (95 percent) showed that religion
plays a positive role in preventing alcoholism. A strong religious
commitment was found to be a consistent characteristic of those
who have not used illicit drugs.[47]

<p>

A study in the <i>American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse</i>
found that faith-based addiction treatment programs are superior
to non-faith-based programs. The study concluded that patients
who attended faith-based programs were much more likely
(45 percent to 5 percent) to report abstinence from opium-based
drugs like heroin for one year after the program. The study which
was funded by NIDA also found that faith-based graduates were
subsequently three times more likely to be married and far less
likely to be on either parole or probation.[48]

<p>

While the average American is influenced by religion, mental health
care professionals are far less likely to be so inclined. Three
of every four Americans agree with the statement, &quot;My whole
approach to life is based on my religion.&quot; Only 33 percent
of psychologists, 39 percent of psychiatrists, 46 percent of social
workers and 62 percent of marriage and family therapists agree.
Given these statistics, it is easy to understand the secular bias
of these health professionals who have great say over the type
of care given a patient and the type of programs approved by government
health care advisors.[49]

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

Most drug treatment doesn't work well and where it does work,
one size does not fit all. A diversity of treatment alternatives
to include low cost taxpayer-free and faith-based programs must
be available.

<p>

Pope John Paul II endorses the church's role in drug treatment.
He spoke to the Italian Federation of Therapeutic Communities
labeling drug abuse a symptom of &quot;a culture starved of genuine
values.&quot;[50] He said the church should have tremendous leverage
in addressing drug addiction.[51]

<p>

Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich supports faith-based programs.
&quot;We need to get back to one-on-one missionary work,&quot;
said Gingrich.[52] &quot;We are in the business of changing and saving
people, not maintaining them in their decay. If you don't start
with a faith-based approach, then you haven't started anything...if
you're not improving your life every day, then you're decaying.&quot;[53]

<p>

There are practical reasons for supporting private or community
faith-based alternatives -- such as cost. Taxpayer-funded residential drug
treatment costs far more than many faith-based and taxpayer-free
programs. The 1994 California Drug and Alcohol Treatment Assessment
found that taxpayer-funded residential drug treatment cost $61.47
per person per day and experienced high recidivism.[54] In comparison,
Victory Outreach costs about $25 per person per day and enjoys
very low recidivism.[55]

<p>

The dramatic differences between taxpayer-funded programs and
faith-based programs possibly explains why Senator Dan Coats (R-Ind.)
told a Senate hearing on the issue of faith-based programs, &quot;I
believe there are people and groups in America with answers,&quot;
people who are &quot;winning the war on poverty and addiction,
one individual at a time.&quot;[56] He supports their active role.

<p>

Addicts need to be taken off drugs and resocialized. Some are
violent offenders who deserve jail, and others can once again
become productive citizens after help from a diversity of programs
including the Phoenix House, Victory Outreach, The Betty Ford
Clinic and Teen Challenge.

<p>

Government shouldn't try to fight the drug war alone. Rather,
it should focus on supply reduction and push prevention and treatment
efforts down to the community level where programs can be tailored
to local needs.

<p>

The local faith community will play a vital role in prevention
and treatment. After all, the church gives people faith and hope
that there are ultimate meaning and purpose of life. It gives
man answers to great questions of life. It establishes a system
of moral duties which have worked. It also gives direction to
public opinion and provides the basis for social order.

<h2>REPORT ON THE 40TH SESSION<br>
OF THE UNITED NATIONS'<br>
COMMISSION ON THE STATUS OF<br>
WOMEN</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<p>

<i>Ellen Lukas</i></center>

<p>

From March 11-22, the 40th session of the United Nations' Commission
on the Status of Women (CSW) met to discuss and approve worldwide
implementation of the Beijing Platform for Action, the U.N.'s
agenda for women's empowerment, &quot;aimed at removing all obstacles
to women's active participation in all spheres of public and private
life.&quot;

<p>

The CSW, a functional commission of the Economic and Social Council
(ECOSOC), was established in 1946 to prepare recommendations for
the promotion of women's rights and on problems requiring attention
in that field. It meets yearly and has a membership of 45 countries.[1]
The Commission was the preparatory body which produced the Fourth
World Conference for Women in Beijing last year.

<p>

In comparison to the Beijing conference, the March CSW session
was a businesslike and uneventful meeting. Since the real work
of hammering together the platform was finished at Beijing, the
CSW session included no demonstrations, no protests, no brawls.
At least 4,000 non-governmental organizations (NGOs) had gone
to Beijing, but they were not prominent or numerous at this meeting.
Even though the Commission had sent out special invitations asking
all NGOs who had gone to Beijing to come to this meeting, there
were perhaps 200 in the gallery on opening day, and on following
days, never more than a dozen.

<p>

Representatives of the Women Count Network lobbied diligently
for recognition of women's unwaged (i.e., house-) work. Bella
Abzug, co-founder of the Women's Environment and Development Organization
(WEDO), who addressed the Commission on its opening day, argued
for accreditation of a permanent roster of women's NGOs to participate
in CSW meetings, much as the Rio Conference NGOs participate in
meetings of the Commission on Sustainable Development. (This question
will be discussed further at the Economic and Social Council meeting
this month.)

<p>

Generally, government delegates to the CSW session were not the
fiery old-line feminists whose presence sparked the Beijing conference.
This time, for the most part, they were the sober permanent mission
representatives who usually serve on the General Assembly's Second
(Economic) Committee. They saw the issues which the session was
considering primarily through a Second Committee prism and were
more interested in economic questions than in ideological ones.
They also pressed for the use of Second Committee methods at the
session, such as the adoption of &quot;Agreed Conclusions&quot;
rather than resolutions in their final statements.

<p>

The meeting began with two days of general debate in which representatives
of the U.N. system gave their views on various aspects of the
organization's implementation of the document. Each of the 45
delegates on the Commission paid the expected tribute to &quot;gender
mainstreaming&quot; and spoke about his or her nation's programs
on behalf of women.

<p>

U.N. system speakers included the Secretary-General's advisor
on gender issues (Rosario Green, a Mexican woman diplomat); the
new director of the Division for the Advancement of Women which
supplies support services for the CSW; a senior advisor from UNICEF;
and a women's advisor from the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR). They talked about the impact of the Beijing Platform
for Action on the CSW agenda -- new programs for girls' education
and health, including strategies against early and unplanned pregnancy,
and plans to deal with sexual violence against refugee women.
A human rights specialist from the World Health Organization spoke
on violence as a public health issue, as well as of women's &quot;right
to health.&quot; (He specified &quot;reproductive rights as formulated
by the [Cairo] International Conference on Population and Development,
as a fundamental human right in all circumstances.&quot;)

<p>

When their turn came to speak, the G77 (a bloc of 137 developing
countries, including China) demanded that implementation of the
Beijing document place more emphasis on development. The representative
of the ultra-liberal 15-nation European Union reminded the session
that, &quot;The human rights of women include their sexual rights,&quot;
and mentioned recent resolutions adopted by the EU on integrating
gender issues into programs of development aid. The EU also managed
to get in a few paragraphs supporting sex education for adolescents,
and total support for the Cairo and Beijing Platforms.

<p>

In her opening speech in the general debate, U.S. representative
to the Commission Linda Tarr-Whelan promised that America &quot;is
very serious about the implementation of the Beijing Declaration
and Platform for Action, and about fulfilling our particular commitments
announced at Beijing....It is our goal to institutionalize as
much change as possible.&quot; In establishing the President's
Interagency Council on Women, she said, the U.S. has for the first
time created a formal mechanism to deal with the follow-up to
a U.N. conference.[2]

<p>

<center><h3>THE INTERACTIVE DIALOGUES</h3></center>

<p>

From March 13-18 the U.N. staged a series of what it called &quot;interactive
dialogues&quot; (discussions between panels of experts chosen
by the U.N. Secretariat, and delegates to the Commission) on three
out of the 12 &quot;areas of concern&quot; mentioned in the Beijing
document. The three subjects covered at the current session were
&quot;Women and Poverty,&quot; &quot;Women and the Media,&quot;
and &quot;Child and Dependent Care, Including the Sharing of Work
and Family Responsibilities.&quot;

<p>

The Women and Poverty discussion ran for two half-day sessions,
March 13 and 14. A Secretariat report which formed the basis for
the discussion stressed the &quot;gender dimension of poverty,&quot;
noting that women constitute a majority of the world's poor, and
contending that they experience poverty differently from men,
because historically women have been disadvantaged in terms of
obtaining education, training and access to employment opportunities,
productive resources and capital.

<p>

Experts for this panel came from five U.N. system agencies: UNIFEM,
UNICEF, UNDP, UNFPA (the U.N. Fund for Population) and the World
Bank, as well as from various governmental and non-governmental
grass-roots organizations. To remedy poverty among women, the
panelists urged the adoption of policy agendas which would assure
women of employment and income. They also agreed on the need for
an integrated approach to poverty which would go beyond provision
of money and creation of jobs to address gender discrimination
and violence. Arguing for the value of reproductive health services
for adolescent girls, UNFPA, which insisted that &quot;education
together with reproductive health are the most important means
of empowering women,&quot; was the only expert in this dialogue
to even mention &quot;reproductive health.&quot;

<p>

In the exchange that followed, more than half the delegates had
harsh words for the World Bank, whose insistence on painful structural
adjustment policies, they said, was hurtful to women.

<p>

The U.S.'s Tarr-Whelan managed to turn her intervention in the
dialogue into a sort of Clinton campaign speech praising the administration's
concern for the poor in America and slamming Congress for neglecting
them. &quot;There is now a polarized debate in the U.S. on poverty,&quot;
she said. &quot;There is not a sufficiently shared societal concern.
In the past, we have focused on a transfer payment method. But,
increasingly our social safety net is being dismantled. Poverty,
especially among children, is increasing....We are, however, trying
new strategies and methods.&quot; Among them: efforts (encouraged
by first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton) to expand business ownership
development for women and new forms of community-based credit
as well as stronger initiatives to recoup child support payments
from &quot;deadbeat dads.&quot; Tarr-Whelan's mention of the commitments
the U.S. had made at Beijing and Copenhagen made her one of the
very few delegates to bring up &quot;family planning&quot; in
connection with poverty.

<p>

The CSW discussion of &quot;Women and the Media&quot; took place
Thursday afternoon and Friday morning, the 13th and 14th. The
Secretariat report on the subject noted that &quot;the representation
in the media of violence against women, particularly sexual violence,
has increased tremendously in past years&quot; as have the production
and marketing of sexually explicit material, which is now a business
with established links to forced prostitution and trafficking
in women. The report also complained that in many countries women
lack access to new communications technologies. It also objected
to the fact that the media often portrayed women unfairly and
urged efforts to combat gender-stereotyping.

<p>

The expert panel on the subject, which included speakers from
governmental organizations, non-commercial media and the U.N.,
generally ignored the report's statements on violence and sexually
explicit material. They denounced the stereotyping of women and
praised women journalists covering the former Yugoslavia for contributing
to the focus on systematic rape during armed conflicts.

<p>

Discussion of &quot;child and dependent care, including the sharing
of work and family responsibilities&quot; ran on March 15 and
March 18. It was arguably the dialogue which will spark the largest
amount of subsequent discussion and have the greatest impact on
the family in the future.

<p>

The Secretariat report on the subject argued that &quot;women
carry a double burden of work and family responsibilities which
reinforces inequality between the sexes.&quot; More and more women
worldwide are going into the labor force all the time, and becoming
heads of households. At the same time, said the report, women's
home responsibilities do not diminish, but they continue to grow
as fewer and fewer women have the support of a spouse or of a
large or extended family to help them care for children or other
dependents. This leaves women crowded into a narrow range of low-status,
low-paying jobs from which they are unable to escape.

<p>

Panelists for child and dependent care were an odd choice for
putative child care experts. Along with a speaker from the Norwegian
Ministry of Family Affairs and representatives from the International
Labor Organization, UNICEF and the Population Council, there was
a woman from the China Family Education Association and a family
policy bureaucrat from Romania.

<p>

The Norwegian spokeswoman said that her government had recently
begun recruiting men for child care and -- although there had
been recent major court cases in Norway dealing with men's abuse
of children -- the government believed that &quot;more experience
by men of such caring and nurturing experiences will actually
prevent violence.&quot; The Population Council said that &quot;though
there is great (and not unfounded) suspicion of non-family 'center
care' in traditional societies,&quot; demand for such centers
could be created among the public by linking child care centers
up with health and vaccination programs, as well as with family
planning services. The Chinese expert gave a cheerful report on
child care in the People's Republic -- three meals a day, naps,
playtime and the possibility of Monday-to-Friday boarding facilities
from 3 years of age and upwards. The Romanian representative inveighed
against her country's &quot;repressive patriarchal tradition.&quot;

<p>

In the subsequent delegate exchange with the panelists, nearly
every country (including even Sudan and Iran) reported that it
already provided some kind of day care to help free employed mothers
from family burdens.

<p>

<center><h3>CSW RESOLUTIONS AND AGREED CONCLUSIONS</h3></center>

<p>

With the close on March 18 of the &quot;dialogue&quot; section
of the CSW session, delegates settled into smaller working groups
to negotiate the resolutions or &quot;agreed conclusions&quot;
they proposed to adopt on the issues under review. They also met
from time to time in full session to hear statements from those
delegates who had not spoken in the general debate and from concerned
NGOs.

<p>

By Thursday night, agreement had been reached on all the amendments
proposed for addition to the resolutions. By the evening of Friday,
March 22, more than a dozen resolutions were adopted.

<p>

Among them was a very commendable statement condemning &quot;traffic
in women and girls&quot; and calling for ratification of conventions
on trafficking in persons and for law enforcement against trafficking
networks and sex tourism. Another good resolution condemned &quot;violence
against civilian women and children in areas of armed conflict
and hostage taking,&quot; and a third worthwhile resolution condemned
&quot;violence against women migrant workers.&quot;

<p>

The resolution adopted on the subject of &quot;women and poverty&quot;
stressed female empowerment as essential to poverty eradication,
and urged governments to develop education and training programs
to promote women's employment and make legislative reforms concerning
the right of inheritance, land ownership, natural resources, technology,
decision-making, and protection during unemployment and maternity.
International financial organizations, including the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund, were urged to assist.

<p>

The resolution on &quot;women and the media&quot; asked, among
other things, for an end to gender-stereotyping.

<p>

The resolution on &quot;child and dependent care, including sharing
of responsibilities between men and women,&quot; asked governments
to recognize the importance of making changes in societal attitudes
toward the work that women do at home, to promote increased participation
of men in family responsibilities including domestic work and
child care, to provide for family leave, and to adopt laws upholding
equal pay for work of equal value (akin to the &quot;comparable
worth&quot; debate that has taken place in the past decade in
the United States).

<p>

Several resolutions were adopted which were specifically related
to the implementation of the Beijing document. A draft resolution,
prepared for consideration by the Economic and Social Council
(ECOSOC), approved the CSW role in overseeing implementation of
the Beijing document as well as a schedule naming which of Beijing's
&quot;critical areas of concern&quot; will be considered in future
CSW sessions. A resolution on &quot;mainstreaming the human rights
of women and girls&quot; urged that the issue of the human rights
of women and girls be integrated into all U.N. policies and programs.
A resolution commented on the U.N.'s &quot;System-Wide Medium
Term Plan for the Advancement of Women,&quot; describing how the
Beijing Platform for Action is to be incorporated throughout all
the work plans of the U.N. system, including education programs,
technical assistance programs, and contacts with governments,
academic and other institutions and NGOs. Another resolution dealing
with drafting an &quot;Optional Protocol to the Convention on
Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW)&quot; asked
for a report on the views of members of the international community
on the feasibility of initiating a reporting procedure on violations
of women's rights in states which are parties to CEDAW.[3]

<p>

<center><h3>THE FAMILY AS AN ISSUE AT THIS SESSION OF THE CSW</h3></center>

<p>

Despite the fact that most women in the world marry and have children 
at some time in their lives, the family remained a non-issue at the 
March 11-22 CSW.

<p>

There was almost no mention of the family in the 
Secretariat reports which formed the basis of the dialogues, in the 
panelists' speeches, in the delegates' comments, or in the adopted 
resolutions -- not even a mention of the Universal Declaration of Human 
Rights' definition of the family as &quot;the basic unit of society.&quot;

<p>

And, of course, there was no suggestion that the family has value
or that it contributes anything meaningful to society. There was
no discussion of how to preserve the family now that it is under
siege, or how to shore it up.

<p>

In the poverty discussion and elsewhere, women were seen primarily
as a labor force, with success as workers and economic decision-makers,
recipients of credit, and consumers of child and elder care assigned
as their highest goal.

<p>

Listening to the speakers at the dialogues and at the negotiations
for the resolutions, one had the impression the traditional family
had already almost totally disappeared. The great question with
regard to human relationships was how to reassign and rearrange
the roles of men and women in whatever kind of partnership in
which they are now living.

<p>

<center><h3>CHILD AND DEPENDENT CARE AS DISCUSSED AT THIS SESSION</h3>
</center>

<p>

There were really two questions approached in the discussions
and resolutions on child and dependent care. The first was the
question of how to ease the double burden women must bear in attending
to jobs as well as to family responsibilities. In the resolution
the Commission adopted on child care, measures suggested included
redistribution of family responsibilities, provisions for parental
leave from work,[4] arrangements for part-time work, more provision
of child care services, and provision of elder care and support
to persons with disabilities. (No reference was made to relieving
the burden of taxation on families with children. The Beijing
Platform for Action focuses on getting women out of the home and
into the labor force. It has no interest in bolstering the family
by tax relief or any other means.)

<p>

The second problem connected
with the question of child care was how to put a market value
on the unpaid work that women do in connection with the home.
Last September the 1995 Human Development Report published by
UNDP estimated that there is $16 trillion worth of unpaid work
done around the world annually, some $11 trillion of it by women.
Unpaid work is an issue about which women's groups staged silent
vigils at Beijing, complaining that lack of remuneration greatly
contributes to women's low social status. If the value of women's
unpaid work were to be counted, they say, it could greatly affect
inheritance rights and divorce settlements, as well as access
to credit and other issues determined by economic contributions.

<p>

At this CSW session, the question of unpaid work was complicated
by introduction into the discussions of the radical feminist terms
&quot;productive&quot; and &quot;reproductive work.&quot; &quot;Reproductive
work,&quot; used in contradistinction to &quot;productive work&quot;
(work outside the home for pay), was applied to such tasks as
&quot;child-bearing, breast-feeding, child-rearing, cooking, housework
and transmission of values [and also, in some places] fetching
water and collecting wood.&quot; The Secretariat report on child
care noted that &quot;reproductive work does not normally carry
with it the entitlement to an income, and those who bear responsibility
for it must take on additional work to generate income of their
own.&quot;

<p>

After making some attempt to wrestle with the terms &quot;productive&quot;
and &quot;reproductive&quot; work, delegates finally dropped the
terms altogether. In the resolution on the subject, they referred
to work connected with the home simply as &quot;unremunerated
work&quot; and urged the recognition of its social and economic
importance. They also urged that governments adopt laws upholding
equal pay for work of equal value, akin to the &quot;comparable
worth&quot; proposals that gained some notoriety in the United
States in the 1980s.

<p>

Although the Beijing Platform for Action (Para 68b) urges that
national and international statistical organizations should: &quot;Devise
suitable statistical means to recognize and make visible the full
extent of the work of women and all their contributions to the
national economy,&quot; including women's contribution in &quot;the
unremunerated and domestic sectors,&quot; CSW delegates decided
to skip the question of how governments might go about putting
a value on this unpaid work.

<p>

There were, however, some suggestions for devising a methodology
to include data on unpaid work in calculations of GDP[5] and other
indicators, put forward by some of the more imaginative NGOs and
by their supporters at INSTRAW (a small U.N. research institute
on women's issues). Essentially, this methodology involved conducting
&quot;time-use&quot; studies, paid for in developing countries
by development institutions and other donors, to count the time
women spend doing household tasks (including those they do simultaneously,
such as caring for children and cooking). Governments could then
factor estimates of the value of this work into the &quot;satellite&quot;
(or parallel) accounts that some countries compile as annexes
to their figures on paid work.

<p>

The present U.S. administration has shown some interest in the
issue of unpaid work by women. Hillary Clinton's speech at Beijing
made a critical reference to the lack of recognition of unwaged
work by governments, and during this CSW session's poverty dialogue,
U.S. Representative Tarr-Whelan announced that &quot;the Departments
of Labor and Commerce are undertaking consultations to determine
how best to construct reliable estimates of the value of unwaged
work in the U.S.&quot;

<p>

Last year, apparently there was a bill in the Congress (H.R. 966,
The Unremunerated Work Act) which called on the Bureau of Labor
Statistics to conduct time-use surveys of the unremunerated work
done by women and men in America, so that its value could be included
in the GDP. The AFL-CIO Executive Council in February 1995 issued
a statement on the bill, declaring that reliable statistical data
about unpaid work in the U.S. is essential to provide for the
well-being of large numbers of women, children and families in
the U.S.

<p>

<center><h3>THE UNITED STATES AS AN ACTOR AT THE CURRENT CSW SESSION</h3>
</center>

<p>

Since the purpose of this meeting was only to approve implementation
of provisions already adopted at Beijing, the U.S. was generally
less assertive at the CSW session than it has been at other recent
U.N. meetings. Even the NGOs at this session complained that the
U.S. did not cheer them on as enthusiastically as it has in the
past.

<p>

The U.S. was on its good behavior at this session even with its
recent opponents. At a negotiating meeting on the poverty resolution,
for example, when the G77 and China proposed an amendment calling
on governments to provide day care centers in very poor neighborhoods
&quot;in order to facilitate the training and integration of mothers
into productive work&quot; (&quot;a fin de facilitar la capacitation
incorporacion de las madres al trabajo productivo&quot;), the
Holy See Observer suggested to U.S. delegates that they might
not really want to back a paragraph implying that motherhood was
a &quot;non-productive effort.&quot;

<p>

The U.S. said they would &quot;take care of it&quot; and did.
When the text resurfaced the next day, it asked for day care centers
&quot;to facilitate the training of mothers for their entry into
paid employment.&quot;

<p>

<center><h3>SWIMTEP</h3></center>

<p>

According to the schedule of meetings adopted in the resolution
on the &quot;Follow-up to the FWCW&quot; (that is, the Beijing
conference), the CSW will not get around to holding a &quot;dialogue&quot;
on the women's health section of the Beijing document until 1999.
Since the recent CSW session was not specifically concerned with
the issues of women's health or women's rights, there was no talk
about sexual orientation, no open mention of abortion, and no
attempt to trip the Cairo language wire on &quot;reproductive
rights.&quot;

<p>

Proceedings at the session were, in fact, so bland and bureaucratic
that one had to remind oneself that the session had quietly approved
the System-Wide Medium Term Plan for the Advancement of Women
(also known as &quot;SWIMTEP&quot;), which gives details of how
the Beijing Platform for Action --- the complete Platform for
Action, including issues relating to women's health and reproductive
rights -- is already being implemented in all U.N. policies and
programs. This is an enterprise that could radically affect society
for years to come.

<p>

To mention only a few of the tasks assigned by SWIMTEP to U.N.
entities on behalf of women's health and reproductive rights:

<p>

UNFPA, WHO, UNICEF and UNESCO will report to the U.N.'s Population
Division on promotion of women's reproductive rights worldwide;

<p>

WHO and UNFPA will provide technical guidance to governments in
the area of fertility regulation, by providing technical guidelines
on specific methods of family planning and community distribution
of contraceptives;

<p>

WHO and UNICEF will develop practical methodologies in the area
of women's reproductive health in support of governments' efforts
to implement reproductive health programs;

<p>

The U.N. system will prepare training and counseling materials
for NGOs, women's groups and health providers, and provide special
programs for girls and boys regarding responsible sexual behavior.
These programs will be run by WHO, UNESCO, UNDP, U.N. Volunteers,
the Center for Human Rights, U.N. Department for Development Support
&amp; Management Services, UNICEF and UNFPA. N.B. These provisions
make no mention of parental rights or the influence of religious
or ethical traditions.

<p>

How much effect the U.N.'s Beijing health strategy will have on
national health policies throughout the world depends to a great
extent on what resources will be available for the enterprise.
The U.N.'s budget problems must be factored into consideration
of this issue. The U.S. has not paid its assessed debt of $699
million for this year's regular U.N. budget, which, among other
things, covers operating expenses of the CSW. In addition, there
are the cuts which Congress made recently in U.S. voluntary contributions
to U.N. agencies (a total of only $285 million for such agencies
as UNICEF, UNDP and the Population Fund this year, compared to
$374 million in 1995). This will certainly be a limiting factor.

<p>

Speaking of finances for the implementation of the Beijing Platform,
SWIMTEP notes that funding &quot;will have to be identified from
all sources and across all sectors....Mobilization of additional
resources, both public and private, including resources from innovative
sources of funding, will be necessary.&quot; Speaking to this
question at the current CSW, U.S. Representative Tarr-Whelan reminded
the U.N. that the U.S. had warned it at Beijing that it expected
the Platform to be implemented &quot;within existing resources, through
reordering priorities and thinking creatively.&quot;

(3/6/96) of the results of a recent U.S. Government survey
on the use being made of the U.S. Family and Medical Leave Act
of 1993.  This law says that companies with more than 50 employees
must provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to workers needing
to care for seriously ill parents, spouses, themselves, or their
children.  The survey showed that only 2 percent of U.S. workers
have availed themselves of the provisions of the law since it
was enacted; 59 percent of leave-takers said they did so to attend
to their own health, not to take care of elderly parents, sick
spouses or children.

<p>

The good news is, being a &quot;family-friendly&quot; corporation
is now considered <I>in</I> by professionals in the field of human
resources.  The bad news is, this new family-friendliness does
<I>not</I> include empowering one parent to support a family on a
single income. Instead, what it means is domestic partner benefits,
on-site day care, business support for intrusive &quot;home visit&quot;
schemes such as Missouri's &quot;Parents as Teachers&quot; program,
and helping new mothers &quot;return to work&quot; (the words
imply that child-rearing is a leisure activity) as soon as possible.

<p>

This is the conclusion this writer reached after attending a two-day
conference entitled, &quot;The 1996 Work and Family Conference:
Is the Family a Corporate Stakeholder?&quot;  The conference
was sponsored jointly by the Conference Board, a leading organizer
of business conferences, and the Families and Work Institute,
a grantee of the U.S. Department of Education.  The conference
was underwritten by Johnson &amp; Johnson and IBM, and was held
in New York City in late April.

<p>

<center><h3>COMPANIES THAT &QUOT;GET IT&QUOT;</h3></center>

<p>

The first panel of speakers was called &quot;Family Values in
a Corporate Context.&quot;  Andrew D. Sherman, vice president
of the benefits consulting firm The Segal Company, said his company's
criterion for family benefits eligibility is &quot;two adults,
not related by blood, in a relationship that is non-platonic,
financially linked, and intended to be permanent.&quot;

<p>

Providing such benefits has been very inexpensive, in part because
only about 1 percent of Segal's employees have chosen to enroll as 
domestic partners.  According to Sherman, this makes domestic partner 
benefits a &quot;win-win&quot; for his company: Its gets praise for its
enlightenment at very low cost.

<p>

The only question, he asked, is why more companies do not offer
such benefits? Sherman's answer was that many CEOs don't &quot;get
it.&quot;

<p>

Detailing other companies policies, Sherman noted that Xerox includes
extended family members as well as domestic partners.  Lotus offers
domestic partner benefits to same-sex couples <I>only,</I> on
the theory that opposite-sex couples 
can acquire those benefits by marrying.  Lotus's aim, Sherman
said, is to be known as &quot;the employer of choice for talented
people of all descriptions.&quot;  Kodak offers benefits to same-
and opposite-sex couples, because of its self-image as a &quot;progressive
and innovative corporation,&quot; Sherman said.

<p>

Wendy Starr, a consultant in the field of &quot;work-family programs,&quot;
and a former human resources executive at Xerox, said the human
resources field has matured from the shuffling of benefits paperwork
to &quot;support of the total person.&quot;  This mandate is all
the more extensive, she noted, because in the field of  benefits,
notions of legal marriage are giving way to &quot;a variety of
significant people.&quot;

<p>

Xerox, whose CEO &quot;gets it,&quot; defines &quot;extended family&quot;
for benefits purposes as those who reside in the employee's home,
are financially dependent on the employee, are not eligible for
benefits elsewhere, and are related to the employee as domestic
partner (same- or opposite-sex), parent, parent-in-law, grandparent,
grandparent-in-law, or child.  (Missing from the list is &quot;spouse,&quot;
but one assumes that not even Xerox has taken the step of affirmatively
penalizing the married.)

<p>

Perhaps the goal of &quot;supporting of the total person&quot;
which many of today's human resources specialists are suggesting
is overreaching.  Laura Nash, who teaches business ethics at Boston
University's School of Management and School of Theology, suggested
the possibility at one time, in her book <I>The Nanny Corporation</I>.
In her Work and Family Conference presentation this year, however,
Nash seemed more concerned with assuring attendees that she is
not really that far off the reservation.

<p>

What happens in the employee's family, she said, affects the company.
The really &quot;progressive&quot; companies are driven by non-economic
values such as &quot;dignity&quot; and &quot;universal access&quot;
-- though she admitted it is difficult to point to shareholder
value created by such policies.

<p>

&quot;You are progressively changing the face of the social fabric,&quot;
Nash told the assembled human resources professionals.

<p>

One could argue that companies should just pay salaries, and not
get into employees' lifestyles, she said, but employers have legitimate
concerns about how employees will spend the extra money.  On the
one hand, conformity and dependence are dangerous, but on the
other, employers want healthy employees, not employees with poor
health and a Porsche.

<p>

Christian C. Kjeldsen, Johnson &amp; Johnson's vice president
of corporate staff, spoke glowingly of his company's on-site day
care centers.  The one at the company's headquarters has 200 children,
and there is a waiting list!  Johnson &amp; Johnson aims to build
to more centers, Kjeldsen said.

<p>

In a stunning illustration of the power of the print media in
elite circles, and an equally stunning illustration of contemporary
corporate values, Kjeldsen noted that the problem of proving the
bottom-line benefits of extensive employee benefits (including
on-site day care) never came up at his company.  The reason? 
<I>Forbes</I> and <I>Business Week</I> ran articles about changing
demographics.  That was all the proof  his company's management
needed to make on-site day care and other benefits a permanent
fixture even through downsizing, &quot;rightsizing,&quot; and
early-outs. In other words, Johnson &amp; Johnson was
building programs to enable mothers to work for them and warehouse
their children, even while it was eliminating programs -- i.e.,
<I>jobs</I> -- that enabled workers to provide for their families
without recourse to day care.

<p>

After a while one sensed that all the cheerleading for &quot;progressively
changing the face of the social fabric&quot; was coming mainly
from the presenters, while the audience had more mundane concerns,
such as getting sanity back into their lives and the lives of
the employees they were supposed to be taking care of.

<p>

Someone from the audience asked Kjeldsen whether all this paternalism
was not perhaps in direct conflict with what they heard at last
year's Work and Family Conference, which focused on the decline
of dependable employment and the consequent need for portable
benefits.  Kjeldsen looked uncomfortable and said that &quot;companies
still have a lot of control over who is and who isn't at a desk.&quot;
Perhaps Kjeldsen's meaning was that Johnson &amp; Johnson, like
many other companies, sees extensive benefits as a recruitment
and retention issue and that the function of those benefits is
to convince prospective and present employees that a corporate
&quot;social contract&quot; still exists, even though none does.

<p>

<center><h3>&QUOT;OUTDATED&QUOT; PERSONNEL POLICIES</h3></center>

<p>

Randall Tobias, CEO of  the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly,
said in the event's keynote address that although some argue that
taking care of the family is not something that should be done
within the walls of the corporation, he disagrees.

<p>

The problem, Tobias said, is that many managers have an &quot;outdated&quot;
view of the family, which is why so many U.S. companies have personnel
policies &quot;based on Ozzie and Harriet.&quot;  Tobias claimed
such a family structure accounts for only 18 percent of employees
in the U.S.

<p>

Eli Lilly has changed with the times, Tobias said.  It is building
an on-site day care center for 220 children.  Its cafeteria prepares
take-home dinners four nights a week.  Other available benefits
include dry cleaning, and a 24-hour counseling service.  &quot;The
child care facility,&quot; said Mr. Tobias, &quot;will benefit
not only the families that use it, but all our employees, stockholders,
customers -- all who benefit from the <I>undivided attention</I>
of our employees.&quot; (Emphasis added)

<p>

Are we perhaps recreating the dreaded &quot;company town&quot;
from a bygone and unlamented era of U.S. labor relations?  Tobias
is not concerned.  &quot;You're kidding yourselves,&quot; he said,
&quot;if you think you can tell employees to leave their problems
at the factory fence.  You cannot hire <I>part</I> of a human
being.&quot;

<p>

Eli Lilly's employees seem to agree.  According to Tobias, the
company's internal surveys show that its employees do not see
the company's policies as intrusive.  They feel they are being
made more productive, and are glad to be part of an effective
corporation.  Human resources today, he said, requires attention
to the &quot;entire lives of our employees,&quot; and its professionals
must help &quot;break down the barriers to change.&quot;

<p>

After lunch, I chose to attend a session featuring Donna Klein,
a human resources executive with Marriott International.  I wondered
if perhaps Marriott's Mormon ownership would lead it toward more
traditional forms of family-friendliness.

<p>

Interestingly, what Marriott is doing is not exactly traditional.
At its headquarters in Atlanta,  Marriott has gotten together
with other hotel chains to establish Atlanta's Inn for Children,
a &quot;family center&quot; for low-income members of the &quot;hospitality
profession.&quot;  It is a 250-slot day care center that also
provides immunization, parent education, and nutrition counseling.

<p>

Marriott has also set up an Associate Resource Line (ARL), which
combines an &quot;employee assistance program&quot; with a 
&quot;case-management approach.&quot;  In other words, the hotel company 
brings the social work profession fully into the private-sector workplace.
In fact, Klein said this decision was made based on the fact
that some of Marriott's managers were spending more than half
of their time on social work rather than with business management.

<p>

In fairness to Marriott, their work force gives them an unusually
pressing need to bring social work into the workplace.  The company
has a high percentage of immigrant employees, many of whom need
help integrating into American society.  For instance, the ARL
has, to date, administered counseling in 15 different languages.
Still, one cannot help but be startled at the breadth of issues
that Marriott now considers to be workplace-related, including
housing, marital problems, and school problems.

<p>

Why have more companies not gone the way of Marriott?  Klein had
a simple explanation:  The wives of their CEO's &quot;don't work.&quot;

<p>

At this session, the audience was on board.  One participant praised
Marriott for having &quot;got religion&quot; on the need to subsidize
&quot;working mothers.&quot;

<p>

&quot;To some extent,&quot; Klein said, &quot;we are just rearranging
our overwork.  Still, better to overwork flexibly than inflexibly.&quot;

<p>

I left that first day remembering an old <I>New Yorker</I> cartoon
in which guests are being announced as they arrive at an ultra-posh
reception.  The butler/herald calls out:  &quot;The Duke and Duchess
of Exxon.  The Earl and Countess of Kodak.  The Marquis and Marchioness
of Glaxo,&quot; etc., etc.  Just as that cartoonist envisioned,
corporate leaders are the aristocracy of today, and they are very
serious about the paternalistic doctrine of &quot;noblesse oblige.&quot;
Whether this is good for the family as institution is another
question.

<p>

<center><h3>NO LONGER SUBSIDIZING THE FAMILY</h3></center>

<p>

A panel on &quot;Corporate Implications of the Fatherhood Debate&quot;
featured William Galston, professor of philosophy and public policy
at the University of Maryland.  Risking the opprobrium of the
mainly-female audience, Galston noted that the surge of women
into the paid work force over the past forty years has coincided
with the replacement of the &quot;military&quot; model of life,
left over from World War II, by the &quot;self-expression&quot;
model.  The result, he said, is that the family is weaker than
ever.

<p>

Galston saw a limited, but real role for the corporation.  It
can ease, but not eliminate, the tension that men feel between
work and home.  Corporate culture should change so that men do
not feel they are endangering their chances of promotion -- or
even of surviving a downsizing -- if they show by their actions
that they take their family responsibilities seriously.

<p>

Kathleen Gerson, professor of sociology at New York University,
was much more optimistic about the state of the family.  Men face
more economic insecurity than before the gender-role revolution,
Gerson said, but that very insecurity gives them the opportunity
to discover that &quot;motherhood and fatherhood are not very
different.&quot;

<p>

Gerson declared that the gender-role revolution is irreversible.
Women in the workforce and &quot;fluidity of marriage,&quot;
she said, are two of the immovable pillars of the new order.

<p>

Those who want to keep corporations out of people's lives fail
to understand those changes, Gerson said.  Companies used to subsidize
an unsalaried caregiver at home by paying the breadwinner (usually
the husband/father) a sufficient salary, she said, but because
of today's  &quot;irreversible&quot; social changes, corporations
must now take responsibility for their employees' whole well-being.

<p>

<center><h3>EMPLOYERS AS TEACHERS</h3></center>

<p>

The conference press kit included a glossy booklet entitled <I>Employers,
Families, and Education</I>, which was produced by the Fatherhood
Project at the Families and Work Institute.  The booklet covers
a variety of topics, including recommendations on how businesses
can provide family-friendly policies such as flextime, working
at home, and paid time-off for parent-teacher conferences.  These
are packaged, however, as ways of  &quot;making family involvement
in learning a goal&quot; and &quot;encouraging employees to get
involved in their children's schooling&quot; -- evidently assuming
that most parents are utterly unconcerned about their children's
education until given a nudge by their employers.

<p>

This assumption is carried forward in many of the specific recommendations
in the booklet.  One section touts an eight-hour &quot;parenting
seminar&quot; created by the U.S. West Education Foundation, and
available for purchase by human resource professionals for use
with their employees.  &quot;Interactive exercises and structured
discussion groups aim to give parents the understanding, confidence,
and skills they need to become positively involved in their children's
education.&quot;  One does not get the impression that parents,
as such, are viewed in a very positive light by the emerging 
corporate-business &quot;partnership&quot; in education.

<p>

The very next paragraph of the Families and Work Institute's booklet
touts the &quot;Parents as Teachers&quot; program, which, despite
the Orwellian choice of words in its name, assumes that 
parents lack even the most basic skills for bringing up their
children, never mind being their children's teachers, and therefore
need ongoing supervision by social workers.  Here is the entire
paragraph verbatim:

<p><blockquote>

<i><b>Parents as Teachers (PAT).</b> A home-school-community partnership
program designed to support parents of children from birth to
age 5 through home visits by parent educators, parent support
groups, and a referral network.  Established originally by four
school districts in Missouri, PAT is now mandated as a service
in that state, and has been replicated in hundreds of other school
districts around the country.  Scott Paper sponsors PAT in two
communities, IBM sponsors it in five, and Honeywell has adapted
the program for its own employees.</i>

</blockquote><p>

Employers, Families and Education was &quot;developed under contract
to the U.S. Department of Education.&quot;  The same notice specifies
that it does not necessarily reflect the views of the Department
of Education, even though Secretary Richard Riley's name appears
on the title page.

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

As shown by the above-quoted text, and by many of the presentations
at the Work and Families Conference, it would be a great mistake
to assume that everything that is &quot;private sector&quot; is
necessarily free from bureaucracy, institutionalized patronization,
and a control-mentality.

<p>

While some of the initiatives discussed at this conference are
no doubt helpful and commonsensical, others are intrusive, paternalistic,
and more or less explicitly aimed at undermining the traditional
family by subsidizing alternatives to it.  These are offenses
that we generally associate with the overweening state.  But private
industry is likely to work hand-in-glove with government in the
campaign for direct access to our children, whom industry views
exclusively as tomorrow's employees and consumers.

<p>

Robert E. Allen, CEO of AT&amp;T, says it better than I could
in a quote prominently featured in <I>Employers, Families, and
Education</I>:

<p><blockquote>

<i>We have not traditionally linked the well-being of children to
the success of business or the governance of nations.  Yet increasingly 
we're acknowledging that upheavals in the American family aren't 
self-contained -- they intersect with business and economic circles 
and loop into the social fabric of this nation. As a society, we 
assume a larger affiliation -- one that implies, not just family 
ties, but added obligations.</i>

</blockquote><p>

This view would be less threatening if it were less accurate.
Anyone who recognizes that family breakdown has consequences
beyond the particular family in question deserves applause.  The
problem comes when we reduce those consequences to their impact
on &quot;business and economic circles,&quot; and then imply that 
they signify the failure of the family as such, and a consequent 
need to deploy &quot;a larger affiliation.&quot;

<title>THE EMPLOYMENT NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT</title>

<body>

<p>

<h2>THE EMPLOYMENT<br>
NON-DISCRIMINATION ACT:<br>
AN UNWARRANTED EXPANSION<br>
OF FEDERAL POWER</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<i>by</i>

<p>

<i>Robert H. Knight</i></center>

<p>

Touted as a logical extension of Title 7 of the Civil Rights Act,
the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (H.R. 1863, S. 972) is actually
a radical change in workplace discrimination law. Backers of ENDA
say, without any credible substantiation, that homosexuals need
heightened protection not afforded to other employees in the workplace.

<p>

But ENDA is being brought up now to complicate efforts to pass
the Defense of Marriage Act. ENDA is bad legislation because it:

<p><ul>

<li>Sets the stage for an enormous expansion of federal power
over employers. This violates the principle of federalism embodied
in the 10th Amendment.

<p>

<li>Guarantees an onslaught of costly litigation which could hurt
small businesses most of all.

<p>

<li>Paves the way for quotas based on sexual preference, regardless
of a provision that stipulates that no quotas are allowed. (Remember
Hubert Humphrey's promise in 1964 that the Civil Rights Act would
never lead to racial quotas?)

<p>

<li>Prohibits employers from disciplining or taking into account
in any way any sexual activity on or off the job by an employee.

<p>

<li>Defines &quot;sexual orientation&quot; so broadly that all
sexual proclivities, from pedophilia to bisexuality, are given
special protection and therefore moral status on a par with sex
within marriage.

<p>

<li>Suggests the federal government is officially supportive of
sexual promiscuity, since bisexuals by definition have sex with
more than one person.

<p>

<li>Creates a broad cultural force that rewards and protects sexual
dysfunction at the expense of traditional marriage and family.

<p>

<li>Poses a serious threat to employers' and employees' freedoms
of religion, speech and association. The law would ensure that
employers could no longer take their most deeply held beliefs
into account when making hiring, management and promotion decisions.
This would pose an unprecedented intrusion by the federal government
into people's lives.

</ul><p>

Homosexual activists claim that as many as 84 percent of the American
people support &quot;equal rights in terms of job opportunities.&quot;[1]
Well, yes. Most Americans believe that homosexuals should have
the same rights all employees have -- but no more than that.

<p>

It depends on how the question is asked. When the question is
asked whether homosexuals should have fewer rights, the same rights
or more rights, a majority says they should have the same rights.
A <I>Newsweek</I> poll in May 1996 asked, &quot;Has the U.S. done
enough to protect gay rights?&quot; Fully 66 percent answered
either &quot;done too much&quot; (40 percent) or &quot;done enough&quot;
(26 percent). Only 27 percent said &quot;more effort needed.&quot;
Polls also show that a majority of Americans believe that it would
be wrong specifically to enact new legislation in this area.[2]

<p>

Sometimes, the question is asked during debates, &quot;Do you
think someone should be fired just for being gay?&quot; Most people
would answer &quot;no.&quot; Few people want gays &quot;discovered&quot;
and fired, and most homosexuals can honestly report no real discrimination
against them. But the loaded question ignores crucial facts, such
as how the person's sexuality was made manifest and whether and
how it affected the workplace or even if children are involved
in any way.

<p>

The Boy Scouts have already suffered numerous legal attacks by
homosexual activists, and ENDA would only make their efforts easier.
There is no protection whatsoever in ENDA for professional Scout
employees. Homosexual activists contend that the Scouts would
be protected in their &quot;primary activities&quot; as a volunteer
group,[3] which is possible, but this could be swept aside by an
activist judge.

<p>

ENDA's sweeping protection based on &quot;sexual orientation&quot;
eliminates any legitimate questions as to appropriateness of sexual
behavior.

<p>

Here are some examples of how ENDA-like policies have already
been or could be abused:

<p><ul>

<li>In Seattle, a CPA referral specialist, Bryan Griggs, laid
off all of his small staff except his wife in 1994. One employee
later charged Mr. Griggs with discrimination and sexual harassment
under Seattle's gay rights law even though Mr. Griggs did not
even know the man was a homosexual. Before he cleared his name,
Griggs spent thousands of dollars defending himself. The homosexual
employee charged that Mr. Griggs had created a bigoted atmosphere
of hatred toward homosexuals because he aired in the office Christian
talk radio on a station on which he had run advertising and kept
a letter from Rep. Jennifer Dunn (R-Wash.) regarding the issue
of homosexuals in the military. The letter from Rep. Dunn was
included in a packet of letters from a variety of public officials,
including President Clinton. Another employee, who also happens
to be homosexual, submitted an affidavit stating that Mr. Griggs
at no time ever created a hostile atmosphere toward homosexuals
nor did he ever harass the other employee in any way. Even the
liberal <I>Seattle Times</I> editorialized that the complaint
represented an abuse of Mr. Griggs' rights as an employer. The
<I>Times</I> wrote: &quot;Now Griggs unfairly faces spending thousands
of dollars in legal fees to defend himself against a problem he
never knew existed. Already, some are calling this a landmark
test. Frivolous is a better name for it. It is a tortured reach
to redefine 'hostile work environment.' It is a scary assault
on the First Amendment.&quot;[4] Such incidents could become common
on a national scale under ENDA.

<p>

<li>In 1991, Shell Oil was fined $5.3 million for dismissing an
executive, Jeffrey Collins, who had used company equipment at
a Shell subsidiary firm, Triton Biosciences, to produce and copy
a flyer advertising a &quot;safe sex&quot; party for homosexual
men.[5] Superior Court Judge Jacqueline Taber ruled that the California
company violated a policy that it would judge employees only on
job performance and not on activities unrelated to work. The ruling
effectively means that California employers like Shell must turn
a blind eye to even the most outrageous outside &quot;activities&quot;
of employees, even when the employee uses company-owned equipment
to promote them. Taber cited a 1979 California Supreme Court ruling
that employees cannot be fired for off-the-job &quot;political&quot;
activities. Promoting &quot;safe sex,&quot; she reasoned, constitutes
a &quot;political&quot; activity. She also made it clear that
Collins' activities were protected not in spite of but because
of his sexual orientation. &quot;The evidence is overwhelming
that homosexual group sexual activity was beyond the pale of conduct
acceptable to the top management of Shell,&quot; she wrote.[6] Taber's
ruling explored, in her words, &quot;the relatively new issue
of how far a corporation may go in demanding that its managerial
staff, in their respective private lives, deport and conduct themselves
in a manner acceptable to and meeting the corporation's concept
of propriety.&quot;[7] By deciding against Shell, the judge ruled
that private companies cannot discourage employees from participating
in homosexual orgies or any other behavior broadly covered under
&quot;sexual orientation.&quot;

<p>

<li>In Loudoun County, Va., Jeffrey Bruton, a teacher/coach at
a public middle school and high school, was found to have appeared
in several hard-core homosexual porn films.[8] Loudoun School Superintendent
Edgar B. Hatrick III said that the teacher would be dismissed
if the allegations are true because, &quot;We believe that teachers
as people who are chosen to be instructors as well as leaders
of our young people, should be exemplary in their professional
as well as personal lives.&quot; He also said he would ask the
state to revoke Bruton's teaching license. Virginia state law
stipulates that a teaching license can be revoked for &quot;conduct
such as immorality, or personal condition detrimental to the health,
welfare, discipline, or morale of students.&quot; Before the school
acted, Bruton resigned and turned in his teacher's license. Under
ENDA, Bruton could have claimed that his &quot;sexual orientation&quot;
is nobody's business -- certainly not his employer's -- and that
school officials would be discriminating against him if they even
mentioned it.

<p>

<li>In 1993, a computer software company in California hired a
temporary employee, who turned out to have been a man dressed
as a woman. One of the women who worked at the company suspected
the &quot;woman&quot; was really a man, and she warned other women
that &quot;she&quot; might use the rest room. Many of the female
employees opted to go several blocks away to use the rest room
of a fast-food restaurant. When &quot;her&quot; temporary employment
was at an end, the &quot;woman&quot; applied for permanent status.
The employer, who still did not know the &quot;woman&quot; was
really a man, declined on the basis that &quot;she&quot; was overqualified
for the position and also had &quot;a chip on her shoulder.&quot;
The &quot;woman&quot; sued the company, claiming discrimination
based on &quot;sexual orientation.&quot; The employer settled
out of court in 1995, paying the &quot;woman&quot; $600,000, as
well as incurring $600,000 in legal bills. As a result of this
expensive legal attack, the company immediately laid off eight
employees and has not yet recovered, dropping from more than 50
to 30 employees.[9]

<p>

<li>An electrician at a large company in Michigan recently wrote
a letter to company management politely protesting a visit by
two homosexual clergymen who had presented materials claiming
that the Apostle Paul, The Old Testament's Jonathan and David,
and probably Jesus Christ were all homosexual and that the Bible
never really condemns homosexuality. The electrician's letter
rebutted the theories. A copy of the letter was taken from one
employee's personal mailbox and left in the mailbox of a woman
known for her lesbian activism within the company. She complained
that this constituted harassment because of her sexual orientation.
The man whose mailbox the letter had been in originally was downgraded
in tradesman's status, effectively costing him $3,000 to $5,000
per year in salary. Other employees who helped type the letter
were summoned before Human Resources and disciplined individually.
The man who wrote the letter has been told his job is now in jeopardy
and faces more hearings before the Human Resources Department.[10]

<p>

<li>In Hollywood, an orthodox Jew was working at his desk when
two homosexual colleagues stopped nearby. They discussed openly
and graphically a homosexual porn film that one of them had seen.
The Orthodox Jew, who says he has nothing against homosexuals
but does not approve of homosexuality, asked them politely not
to talk about pornography around him. The two men charged him
with sexual harassment. Apparently, any interference with their
enjoyment of a sexually-explicit, &quot;gay&quot; pornographic
film (even after the fact) constituted disapproval of their &quot;sexual
orientation.&quot;[11]

</ul><p>

<center><h3>SUMMARY</h3></center>

<p>

ENDA is so broad that any bizarre sexual behavior would be protected.
Under this legislation, if an employer heard that a highly visible
employee was openly flaunting his sexual tastes, having highly
noticeable adulterous affairs, or discussing his taste for pornography
with other employees, the employer would have no recourse. Even
asking about such activities might be construed as sexual harassment
based on sexual orientation. Since courts consistently have found
that &quot;sexual orientation&quot; is meaningless without sexual
activity itself, any legislation based on &quot;sexual orientation&quot;
defends all sexual behavior and declares it to be irrelevant to
the employer and to customers.

<p>

What at first glance appears to be a harmless gesture of 
&quot;tolerance&quot; toward homosexuals in the workplace actually is 
a mighty weapon to be used against employers, other employees who 
believe that homosexuality is wrong, and against the freedoms of 
association, religion and speech. It would distort the concept of civil 
rights by creating an unprecedented behavioral component whose outer
limits cannot even be imagined.

<p>

<center><h3>KEY POINTS</h3></center>

<p><ul>

<li>ENDA has nothing to do with the Defense of Marriage Act and
should be judged on its own merits at a later date.

<p>

<li>Americans favor equal rights, not special rights, for gays
in the workplace. Homosexuals deserve the same rights as other
Americans -- no more, no less.

<p>

<li>Senators Kennedy, Jeffords and Lieberman dismiss opposition
to ENDA as mere &quot;prejudice.&quot;[12] If they prevail and ENDA
becomes law, then the biblically-held views of millions of Americans
will be actively suppressed by their own government in the name
of &quot;tolerance.&quot;

<p>

<li>ENDA ought to be called the Government Lawyers Expansion Act,
since it would result in so many opportunities for the use of
lawsuits to expand federal power.

<p>

<li>Legitimate minorities will see their own efforts to ensure
equal treatment undermined by this unwarranted expansion of claims
by a group that in no way shares their history.

<p>

<li>As a group, homosexuals enjoy enormous economic and political
power, and are not disadvantaged the way true minorities have
been.[13] Civil rights laws were enacted to
offset discrimination against African-Americans, but homosexuals
can claim no such victim status as an oppressed, poor minority.
They are trying to hijack a movement for their own advantage.

TEEN DRUG ABUSE:<br>
WHAT THE SURVEYS SAY</h2>

<p>

Parents are rightfully concerned about and possibly confused by
the recent flurry of teen drug abuse reports.  The numbers seem
high and appear to be getting worse.  This paper will profile
the latest reports focusing on drug abuse by adolescents (ages
12 to 17).

<p>

The studies found:

<p><ul>

<li>Teenagers in trend-setting California are abusing drugs at
levels that rival peaks more than a decade ago.

<p>

<li>There is a significant downward shift in the number of teens
who perceive drug risks.

<p>

<li>Boomer parents seriously underestimate drug experimentation
among teenagers.

<p>

<li>Parents who talk to their teenagers about drugs can make
a significant difference.

<p>

<li>In 1995, heroin- and marijuana-related emergency room episodes
rose 19 and 17 percent, respectively.

<p>

<li>Most of the rise in heroin abuse is due to increased snorting
and smoking rather than needle injecting.

<p>

<li>Black teenagers are the most affected by the surge in marijuana
abuse (up 195 percent for males and 253 percent for females).

<p>

<li>Nearly half (44 percent) of all high school students smoked
cigarettes at least once last year.

<p>

<li>There is conflicting evidence that cigarettes may or may not
act as a gateway to illicit drug abuse.

</ul><p>

<center><h3>1995 NATIONAL HOUSEHOLD SURVEY ON DRUG ABUSE</h3></center>

<p>

On August 20, 1996 the federal government reported that adolescent
drug abuse is rising fast.  Alarms over the drug scourge sounded
across the country.

<p>

Donna Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services, warned,
&quot;Drug, alcohol and tobacco use by young people is a poison
in the well of our national future.&quot;  White House Drug Policy
Director General Barry McCaffrey said, &quot;We must not allow
drug use by young Americans to return to the disastrous levels
of the 1970's and early 1980's. That would be a tragedy.&quot;[1]

<p>

The 1995 National Household Survey (NHS) on Drug Abuse found that
an estimated 12.8 million Americans were current illicit drug
users.  In 1992, the rate of past-month illicit drug abuse by
adolescents (ages 12 to 17) reached a low of 5.3 percent. By
1995 it had climbed to 8.2 percent and now it is at 10.9 percent.
That is a 105 percent increase over the past three years.[2]

<p>

The NHS is a representative national sample and has been done
annually since 1971.  Since 1992, the survey has been supported
and directed by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration (SAMHSA), which is part of the U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services.

<p>

In 1995, the teen drug of choice was marijuana.  The rate of past-month
use of marijuana jumped 33 percent between 1994 and 1995.  Since
1992, the rate has more than doubled.

<p>

The abuse of so-called &quot;hard&quot; drugs is especially alarming.
The NHS found that past-month adolescent abuse of cocaine shot
up 166 percent between 1994 and 1995, and LSD abuse rose 55 percent.

<p>

Perhaps more alarming are the number of recent first-time abusers.
Looking back over the past three decades (1964 to 1994), the
number of first-time adolescent abusers (ages 12 to 17) across
many illicit drugs has increased dramatically and especially over
the past four years. Consider the facts.

<p><ul>

<li><b>Marijuana</b>. Since 1991 the number of first time adolescent
abusers has risen 95 percent. Looking back three decades to 1964
there were 4,400 first-time marijuana users while in 1994 there
were 74,200.  That's an incredible increase of 1,600 percent.
<I>(Marijuana First-Time Adolescent Abusers, 1964-1994, Figure
1)</I>

<p>

<li><b>Cocaine</b>. The number of first time adolescent cocaine
abusers has risen 820 percent since 1964 and 127 percent in just
the past three years.  In 1964, there were 1,100 first-time abusers
and 10,200 first-time abusers in 1994.<I>(Cocaine First-Time Adolescent
Abusers, 1964-1994, Figure 2)</I>

<p>

<li><b>Inhalants</b>. Since 1991 the number of first-time inhalant
abusers has increased 98 percent, and the number of first-time
inhalant abusers has increased 11,100 percent since 1964.  In
1994, NHS found that 22,200 teenagers abused inhalants for the
first time.  <I>(Inhalant First-Time Adolescent Abusers, 1964-1994,
Figure 3)</I>

<p>

<li><b>Hallucinogens</b>. Since 1991 the number of first-time
hallucinogen abusers has increased 108 percent and the number
of first-time hallucinogen abusers has increased 2,000 percent
since 1964.  In 1994, NHS found that 23,300 teenagers abused
hallucinogens for the first time.  <I>(Hallucinogen First-Time
Adolescent Abusers, 1964-1994, Figure 4)</I>

<p>

<li><b>Heroin</b>. Since 1991 the number of first-time heroin
abusers has increased 320 percent and the number of first-time
heroin abusers has increased 600 percent since 1964.  In 1994,
NHS found that 2,100 teenagers abused heroin for the first time.
<I>(Heroin First-Time Adolescent Abusers, 1964-1994, Figure 5)</I>

<p>

<li><b>Alcohol</b>. Since 1991 the number of first-time alcohol
abusers has increased 38 percent and the number of first-time
alcohol abusers has increased 277 percent since 1964.  In 1994,
NHS found that 171,900 teenagers abused alcohol for the first
time. <I>(Alcohol First-Time Adolescent Abusers, 1964-1994, Figure
6)</I>

<p>

<li><b>Cigarettes</b>. Since 1991 the number of first-time cigarette
abusers has increased 16 percent and the number of first-time
cigarette abusers has increased 33 percent since 1964.  In 1993,
NHS found that 125,400 teenagers abused cigarettes for the first
time.  The study found that teenagers who smoked were about eight
times as likely to use illicit drugs and 11 times as likely to
drink heavily as nonsmoking teens.  <I>(Cigarette First-Time Adolescent
Abusers, 1964-1994, Figure 7)</I>

</ul><p>

The Drug Abuse Warning Network, also conducted by SAMHSA, reported
an increase in drug-related emergency room visits.  There were
531,800 drug-related visits last year, and the greatest increases
were attributed to heroin and marijuana-related episodes (up 19
percent and 17 percent, respectively, from 1994).  The most commonly
reported motive for taking a substance was &quot;suicide attempt
or gesture&quot; (38 percent).[3]

<p>

<center><h3>MONITORING THE FUTURE STUDY</h3></center>

<p>

Another government-sponsored study found similar teenage drug
abuse trends.  &quot;Monitoring the Future:  A Continuing Study
of the Lifestyles and Values of Youth&quot; is conducted by the
University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research and funded
by the National Institute on Drug Abuse.[4] The study surveyed 50,000
8th-, 10th- and 12th- graders from 435 public and private schools
during the spring of 1995.

<p>

The proportion of 8th-graders taking any illicit drug has doubled
since 1991.  Since 1992 the proportion of any illicit drug abuse
has risen 65 percent among 10th-graders and 44 percent among 12th-graders.
The details are outlined below.

<p><ul>

<li><b>Marijuana</b>. Between 1991 and 1995, lifetime abuse among
8th-graders rose 166 percent (from 6 percent to 16 percent). 
Among 10th-graders annual abuse almost doubled from 15 percent
in 1992 to 29 percent in 1995.  Among 12th-graders annual abuse
increased 59 percent from 22 percent in 1992 to 35 percent in
1995. Nearly one in 20 high school seniors was a daily marijuana
abuser.

<p>

<li><b>LSD</b>. LSD abuse continued to rise.  The proportions
reporting abuse were 3 percent, 7 percent and 8 percent for 8th-,
10th- and 12th-graders respectively. Between 1991 and 1995 annual
abuse rose 76 percent for 8th-graders; 89 percent for 10th-graders;
and 54 percent for 12th-graders. For 12th-graders abuse within
the last month was up 37 percent.

<p>

<li><b>Hallucinogens</b>. Hallucinogens other than LSD showed
a smaller increase in 1995. The annual prevalence rates for 8th-,
10th- and 12th-graders were 2 percent, 3 percent and 4 percent,
respectively.

<p>

<li><b>Cocaine</b>. Between 1991 and 1995 annual abuse rose 136
percent for 8th-graders; 59 percent for 10th-graders; and 14 percent
among 12th-graders.

<p>

<li><b>Crack cocaine</b>. Between 1991 and 1995 annual abuse
rose 129 percent for 8th-graders; 100 percent for 10th-graders;
and 40 percent for 12th-graders.

<p>

<li><b>Heroin</b>. Annual abuse in 1995 was between 1.1 percent
and 1.4 percent for all three grade levels -- a rise of 57 to
150 percent.  The investigators hypothesized that non-injection
forms of use like snorting and smoking account for the recent
rise.  Many heroin abusers reported only non-injectable use (32
percent, 45 percent, and 57 percent of past-year heroin users
for grades 8, 10 and 12, respectively).

<p>

<li><b>Alcohol</b>. Heavy drinking (five or more drinks in a
row) was reported by 15 percent of 8th-graders; 24 percent of
10th-graders; and 30 percent of 12th-graders.

</ul><p>

Fewer students report seeing drugs as dangerous.  The risk perception
for marijuana dropped from 79 percent of 12th-graders in 1991
to 61 percent in 1995.  There was also a decline in the perceived
dangers of using crack cocaine, cocaine powder, LSD and heroin.

<p>

Lloyd Johnston, principal investigator of the Michigan study,
blames the lack of information and anti-drug emphasis for the
growing drug problem.  &quot;These newest waves of children entering
adolescence,&quot; said Johnston, &quot;have had less opportunity
to learn about the dangers of drugs than did youngsters who grew
up in the eighties.... During the last three or four years the
amount of public attention paid to the drug problem, and its ravages,
has plummeted.  There are dramatically fewer newscasts on the
subject and fewer anti-drug commercials are getting on the air.&quot;[5]

<p>

Johnston says that most Americans still see drugs as dangerous
but warns &quot;there is a clear erosion in these attitudes and
beliefs, and we conclude that this erosion explains most of the
change in their actual drug-using behaviors.&quot;

<p>

<center><h3>TREND-SETTING STATE ABUSE UP</h3></center>

<p>

California has long been identified as the nation's trend setter.
A recent report from that state should shock all Americans.

<p>

On August 26, 1996, California's Attorney General released a new
statewide survey that shows drug abuse rising rapidly.[6] Dan Lungren,
the attorney general, said, &quot;In the late 80's, drug use among
California students decreased.  In the early 90's, it mostly leveled
off, with some warning signs of small increases.  Over the past
four years, we have witnessed a dramatic increase in drug use
among students -- back to levels that rival peaks ten years ago.&quot;

<p>

The sixth biennial &quot;California Student Substance Use Survey&quot;
polled public school students in grades 7, 9 and 11. Based on
student reports of drug use within the past six months, it found:

<p><ul>

<li><b>Marijuana</b>. More than a third (34.2 percent) of 9th-graders
have abused marijuana within the past six months, a 60 percent
rise in four years.  Nearly half (42.8 percent) of 11th-graders
have abused marijuana within the past six months, a 46 percent
rise in four years.

<p>

<li><b>Amphetamine</b>.  More than one in ten (10.8 percent) of
9th-graders have abused amphetamines within the past six months,
a 227 percent rise in four years.  More than one in ten (10.4
percent) of 11th-graders have abused amphetamines within the past
six months, a 53 percent rise in four years.

<p>

<li><b>LSD</b>. Nearly one in ten (9.9 percent) of 9th-graders
have abused LSD within the past six months, a 161 percent rise
in four years.  More than one in ten (10.8 percent) of 11th-graders
have abused LSD within the past six months, a 33 percent rise
in four years.

<p>

<li><b>Heroin</b>. Heroin abuse for 9th-graders has jumped from
1.0 percent in the last survey to 2.9 percent, a 190 percent increase
in just two years.  Eleventh-graders have seen a 69 percent increase
in the last four years.

<p>

<li><b>Cocaine</b>. Cocaine abuse among 9th-graders has jumped
78 percent in the last four years.  For 11th-graders it has risen
9 percent.

<p>

<li><b>Alcohol</b>. Most teens have used alcohol in the last
six months (50.3 percent of 7th-graders; 67.2 percent of 9th-graders;
and 75.3 percent of 11th-graders).

</ul><p>

Attorney General Lungren blames parents and the pop culture for
rising abuse rates.  He says some of the parents are abusers themselves.
The glamorization of heroin is the most recent example of media's
drug promotion effort.  &quot;We can look to the advertising business
to spot a trend,&quot; says Lungren. &quot;Companies such as Gucci
and Versace use emaciated, pale models with dark circles under
their eyes, known as the 'heroin chic' look, to sell clothing.
One company goes so far as to have one of its models roll up
his sleeve, as if he is getting ready to 'shoot up.'&quot;

<p>

Lungren called for a &quot;return to the power&quot; of the truth.
&quot;Our national commitment in the 1980s to a cultural discouragement
of drugs with its emphasis on youth prevention and zero tolerance
worked,&quot; said Lungren.

<p>

<center><h3>AMERICA'S LARGEST PARENT GROUP<br>
FINDS HIGH DRUG ABUSE</h3></center>

<p>

The Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education (PRIDE) announced
that teenagers are using drugs more and too few parents are doing
what they can to prevent it.

<p>

On November 2, 1995, PRIDE reported significant increases in cigarette
and marijuana abuse among students in grades 6 through 12.[7] There
were also rises in cocaine and hallucinogen abuse.

<p>

PRIDE's annual survey, which included nearly 200,000 students,
found the following levels of drug abuse.

<p><ul>

<li><b>Marijuana.</b> One third of high school seniors smoked
marijuana in the past year, and 21 percent smoke monthly.  Nine
of 10 marijuana smoking seniors said they started pot smoking
during high school years at ages 14 to 17.  Young blacks are the
most affected by the surge in marijuana abuse.  Use among black
males rose by 195 percent (4.5 percent to 13.3 percent) in the
past four years, and use by black females rose by 253 percent
(1.9 percent to 6.7 percent).

<p>

<li><b>Cocaine</b>. PRIDE found a 36 percent increase (3.3 percent
to 4.5 percent) in cocaine use by high school students since 1991-92.

<p>

<li><b>Hallucinogen</b>. Use has risen 75 percent (4.4 percent
to 7.7 percent) since 1988-89.

<p>

<li><b>Cigarettes</b>. Cigarette abuse has reached its highest
level since PRIDE began surveying.  Nearly half (44 percent) of
all high school students smoked at least once in the past year,
compared with 37 percent in 1988-89.

</ul><p>

PRIDE found that parents who talk to their teenagers about drugs
can make a difference. Drug abuse declined among students whose 
parents frequently discussed drugs with them.  Among high school 
students whose parents &quot;never&quot; talk about drugs, 
one-third (34 percent) smoked marijuana, versus
one-quarter (24 percent) among high school students who said they
talk with their parents &quot;a lot&quot; about drugs.

<p>

Thomas J. Gleaton, president of PRIDE, said, &quot;The most effective
drug prevention program in the world -- parental intervention
-- is used far less than we think.&quot;

<p>

<center><h3>1996 SURVEY BY PARTNERSHIP FOR A DRUG-FREE AMERICA</h3></center>

<p>

Drug surveys have consistently shown that abuse rises as perception
of risk falls.  A recent nationwide survey validates this observation.

<p>

&quot;Changes in attitudes drive changes in behavior,&quot; said
Ginna Marston, director of research and strategic development
for Partnership for a Drug-Free America.  &quot;These findings
tell us one thing:  drug use will continue increasing among teenagers
until these attitudes change.&quot;[8]

<p>

In 1996, PDFA announced the results of its annual Partnership
Attitude Tracking Study.  This is the largest, ongoing body of
research on drug-related attitudes in America.  The survey sampled
teenagers, pre-teens and parents about attitudes, parent-child
communication and risks.  It found:

<p><ul>

<li>Adolescents see fewer physical and social risks in illicit
drugs.

<p>

<li>Most (60 percent) baby boomer parents are drug experienced.

<p>

<li>Three out of four boomer parents do not want their teenagers
experimenting with drugs.

<p>

<li>Boomer parents seriously underestimate drug experimentation
among their teenagers (14 percent of parents believe their children
have experimented with marijuana but 38 percent of teens report
smoking pot).

<p>

<li>There is a communication gap between teens and parents.  Most
parents (95 percent) say they have talked with their children
about drugs, but only 77 percent of teens agree.

</ul><p>

There has also been a shift in the drug risks perceived by teenagers.

<p><ul>

<li>The number of teens who agree with the statement &quot;taking
drugs scares me&quot; declined from 47 percent in 1993 to 36 percent
in 1995.

<p>

<li>The number of teens who agree with the statement that they
do not want to hang around with drug users declined from 55 percent
in 1993 to 39 percent in 1995.

<p>

<li>Teens see less risk in regular and trial use of marijuana.

<p>

<li>Teens see less risk in both crack and cocaine abuse.

</ul><p>

The study speculated about why there has been a drop in perceived
drug risks.

<p><ul>

<li>Select music groups encourage marijuana legalization.   In
1995, Capricorn Records released <I>Hempilation</I>, a benefit
album for the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana
Laws (NORML).  At least 45 bands have declared support for legalizing
marijuana.

<p>

<li>Marijuana abuse is portrayed lightly or as inconsequential
behavior. The number of drug-related stories airing on the three
major television networks between 1989 and 1994 declined by more
than 83 percent (from 518 stories in 1989 to 82 in 1994).  Some
of the programs were veiled drug promotions like <I>ABC</I>'s
&quot;America's War on Drugs -- Searching for Solutions&quot;
(April 6, 1995) and <I>Discovery Channel's</I> &quot;The War on
Drugs&quot; (June 20, 1995).  Even the network news favorably
profiled marijuana.  For example, <I>NBC</I>'s <I>Nightly News</I>
aired a one-sided viewpoint by Dr. Lester Grinspoon, a member
of NORML.  The <I>NBC</I> &quot;Health News&quot; segment by Robert
Bazell interviewed many people who claim marijuana helps them
with medical problems that include AIDS, multiple sclerosis, glaucoma,
and cancer.  <I>NBC</I> ignored more than 10,500 scientific studies
which chronicle the adverse consequences of marijuana use.

<p>

<li>The marijuana fashion craze in the early 1990s attracted wide
media attention.  Companies like Adidas have popularized marijuana
through the introduction of &quot;The Hemp&quot; shoe.  Hemp is
a name for the type of plant from which marijuana is derived.

<p>

<li>The public continues to debate the legalization of drugs.
Several years ago, the Surgeon General called for a study of
drug legalization.  Noted conservative columnist William F. Buckley,
Jr. called for legalization in a widely publicized edition of
<I>National Review</I> (February 12, 1996).  On November 5, 1996
Californians will be asked to decide whether to legalize marijuana
for medicinal purposes.

</ul><p>

&quot;With teenagers seeing fewer risks with marijuana and drug
use,&quot; said Partnership Chairman James Burke, &quot;we can
expect to see another increase in adolescent drug use in 1996....
After years of tremendous progress, the country is losing precious,
hard-won ground in its effort to curb adolescent drug use.  Today's
drug trends are similar to those of the late 1960s, and the outlook
for the near future is disturbing.&quot;

<p>

<center><h3>SURVEY LINKS DRUG ABUSE TO POPULAR CULTURE</h3></center>

<p>

Adults and adolescents see popular culture as a major factor in
the recent increase of drug abuse, according to Columbia University
researchers.

<p>

The Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse (CASA) at Columbia
released a national survey on June 29, 1995 showing that 76 percent
of adolescents and 67 percent of adults blame popular culture
-- television, movies, magazines, and popular music -- for encouraging
illegal drug use.[9]

<p>

&quot;What's at stake here is America's children,&quot; says CASA
president and former HEW Secretary Joseph A. Califano, Jr.  &quot;We
know that individuals who make it from age 10 to age 20 without
using illegal drugs, without abusing alcohol, without smoking,
are virtually certain never to do so.&quot;

<p>

The Luntz Research Company, which surveyed 2,400 adults and adolescents,
asked, &quot;What is the most important problem facing kids today?&quot;
One-third of the adolescents answered &quot;drugs.&quot;  A distant
second with 13 percent was &quot;crime and violence in school,&quot;
which often also involves drugs.

<p>

<center><h3>TARGETING THE TOBACCO GATEWAY</h3></center>

<p>

The Clinton administration has chosen to avoid the epidemic of
illicit drug abuse and/or attack it indirectly via a frontal assault
on tobacco.  It has launched a major assault on teen tobacco abuse
by issuing a presidential executive order to classify nicotine
as a drug.  Apparently the President believes reducing tobacco's
availability will protect teenagers from the temptation of cigarettes
and will impact the illicit drug problem because tobacco abuse
as a gateway to illicit drugs.  But not all experts agree.

<p>

Tobacco is not necessarily a gateway for illicit drugs.  According
to an Abt. Associates Inc. memorandum dated August 28, 1995 and
given to the White House, &quot;Smokers do not necessarily become
marijuana users.&quot;  Abt.'s reports that &quot;about two of
every three marijuana users became marijuana users before they
smoked cigarettes.&quot;[10]

<p>

The &quot;gateway&quot; theory is bolstered, however, by Lloyd
Johnston, the principal investigator of the Monitoring the Future
Study.  He wrote in 1995, &quot;[c]igarette smoking is strongly
correlated with the use of marijuana, and suggest[s] that the
upturn in cigarette smoking during the past four to five years
may well have contributed to the increase in marijuana use of
the same period.  Because smoking usually precedes marijuana use
and teaches youngsters how to take smoke into their lungs to secure
a drug-induced effect, it provides an excellent training ground
for learning how to smoke marijuana.&quot;[11]

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

Snuffing-out Joe Camel and Mr. Kool are only part of the answer
to the illicit drug plague.  Leaders at all levels must speak
out against the danger of illicit drugs.  Strong law enforcement
must stop the supply, and parents must communicate frankly and
frequently with their children.  Drugs should be demonized not
glamorized by the media.  These changes will go a long way to
increase the perceived level of risk for teenagers.

<p>

The facts about drugs are clear  -- illicit drug abuse is rising.
Now is not the time to divert attention away from the dangerous
threat of illicit drugs.   Most Americans want a tough line on
drugs.  They know that taking a tough line will save lives and
taxpayer money.

<h2>FAITH-BASED<br>
PRISON PROGRAMS<br>
CUT COSTS AND RECIDIVISM</h2>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

Crime in America seems out of control.  The government's response
has been to build more prisons and keep convicts behind bars longer.
But that won't cut growing incarceration costs and high recidivism
rates. Such cuts should be the goal, and faith-based prison programs
can help.

<p>

&quot;I believe moral rehabilitation,&quot; says Burl Cain, warden
of the Louisiana state penitentiary in Angola, &quot;is the only
true rehabilitation there is.&quot;[1]

<p>

Although most Americans support punishment for criminal offenders,
there is a growing consensus that there is more to solving the
crime problem. &quot;The nation's crime and prison problem is
fundamentally a moral and spiritual problem,&quot; says Richard
Rettig, chairman of University of Central Oklahoma's sociology
and criminal justice department.  &quot;We should bring the criminal
abusers not to a punishing environment which hurts and kills,
but unto a God that heals,&quot; Rettig says.[2]

<p>

Whitney Kuniholm is the executive vice president of Prison Fellowship,
the world's largest prison ministry.  Kuniholm explains, &quot;You
can have job programs, literacy programs, drug programs and educational
programs, but unless something changes on the inside [of the person],
that stuff isn't going to make a difference.&quot;[3] Inmates agree.

<p><ul>

<li>Bill McCall, a convicted murderer in Indiana, explains, &quot;Before
I became a Christian, there was no way I could deal with what
I had done.  But now that I know God has forgiven me, I can forgive
myself.&quot;[4]

<p>

<li>Mark Wiggins, a Texas inmate convicted of possession of a
sawed-off shotgun, says, &quot;I was just out of control, totally
out of control.  I had no love, no sense of caring, no sense of
anything.  I just...didn't care.&quot;  Wiggins says he became
a Christian through the unswerving efforts of his wife.  He says
he was simply tired of losing and wanted to change.  &quot;Now
I feel a sense of peace inside of me that I've never felt,&quot;
he says.[5]

<p>

<li>Ex-convict Billy Greer, once an armed robber and drug dealer,
has been out of prison and straight for three years.  &quot;I
place God first and I'm able to overcome the temptation,&quot;
says Greer, &quot;because God, to me, is greater.&quot;[6]

</ul><p>

North Carolina's former secretary of corrections, Aaron Johnson,
says Prison Fellowship's religious programs made his prisons more
manageable.  &quot;There was a change in the environment in those
prisons.  Infraction rates went down in almost every prison.&quot;[7]
This is good news for taxpayers because these programs lead
to lower operating costs, more frequent parole, and reduced recidivism.

<p>

Cost-conscious states are taking notice.  Texas Governor George
Bush may soon give approval for a private, faith-based prison.
Not only does the program promise to save the taxpayer millions
in operating costs, but it gives hope to Texas citizens that fewer
convicts will leave prison only to commit more crimes.

<p>

Before considering the benefits of faith-based prison programs,
however, consider a profile of the worsening crime problem and
America's prison system.  This profile will help one appreciate
just how desperate we are for better solutions.

<p>

<center><h3>SOCIETY COPING WITH CRIME</h3></center>

<p>

The U.S. has tripled its prison population in the past 15 years,
and the Rand Corporation projects it will double again over the
next decade.[8] Meanwhile, prison costs doubled to $24.6 billion
over the past decade, and experts foresee substantial increases
in the future.

<p>

A U.S. Justice Department study found that more than half (62.5
percent) of all released state prisoners are rearrested for a
felony or serious misdemeanor within three years, and almost half
(41.4 percent) return to prison.[10] This is in spite of a serious
decline in the crime clearance rate (the rate at which police
identify and arrest suspects).  Since 1955, the probability of
a murderer being arrested has declined 26 percent, and for a rapist
the probability has gone down 27 percent.[11]

<p>

Keeping chronic and violent criminals in jail makes sense.  &quot;All
of us look at the futility of having to spend money on prisons,&quot;
says John Engler, governor of Michigan, &quot;but we recognize
the public necessity.&quot;[12] That's why Virginia's governor, George
Allen, ended parole and more than doubled expected prison time
for many offenders.  &quot;People were disgusted with the dishonesty
and leniency of the system,&quot; Allen says.[13]

<p>

Americans aren't so concerned about punishing criminals as they
are about keeping the fox out of the chicken coop.  For example,
a 1994 nationwide Wirthlin Group poll asked, &quot;What do you
feel is the main purpose of prisons?&quot;  To that question,
61 percent said, &quot;to keep criminals out of society.&quot;[14]
Almost three in four (73 percent) Americans told <I>ABC News</I> 
that they approve of building more prisons so that
longer sentences can be given to prisoners.[15]

<p>

John J. DiIulio, a criminologist and Brookings and Manhattan Institute
scholar, explains that there are financial benefits to locking
up chronic criminals.  &quot;It costs society at least twice as
much to let a prisoner loose than to lock him up.&quot;[16] In fact,
according to Patrick Langan, a senior statistician with the Justice
Department, tripling the prison population from 1975 to 1989 likely
prevented 390,000 murders, rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults
in 1989 alone.  Given that each murder costs society $2.4 million,
each rape $60,000, each arson $50,000, imprisoning violent criminals
can be a bargain.

<p>

Indeed, many Americans are persuaded that prisons are worth the
cost.  According to William and Mary College economists Thomas
Marvell and Carlisle Moody, 21 crimes are averted for each criminal
who is kept off the street.[18] That translates into hundreds of
billions of annual savings in costs to society.

<p>

The enthusiasm for more prisons and longer sentences is not universal,
however.  Alvin Bronstein of the ACLU's National Prison Project
opposes the current rate of incarceration.  &quot;There is a spirit
of meanness, selfishness and punitiveness,&quot; says Bronstein,
&quot;that seems to have no bounds.&quot;[19] Tim Matthews of the
American Probation and Parole Association says, &quot;It doesn't
take an Einstein to tell you if prison were the answer, crime
should have dropped.&quot;[20]

<p>

The immediate answer, of course, is that crime <I>has</I> dropped.
Violent crime was down 5 percent in the first half of 1995 and murder 
dropped 12 percent, the largest drop in the murder rate in years and six 
times larger than the drop in the same period in 1994.[21]

<p>

Rep. Bill McCollum (R-Fla.), Chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee
on Crime, worries that these latest crime statistics &quot;will
give us a false sense of security.&quot;[22] This is especially true
for young offenders, where problems have been growing in recent
years -- and are apt to get worse before they get better.

<p>

There are some clear-cut social and demographic trends that make
it very probable that today's shocking rate of youthful violence
will explode over the next decade.

<p>

By the year 2005, the number of teens from 15 to 19 years of age
will increase by 23 percent, and a very large proportion of these
teens will be coming from homes without fathers.  Given the clear
and established correlation between father absence and crime,
some experts estimate that violent crime like murder could increase
to 40,000 killings per year -- up 60 percent from current levels.[23]

<p>

James Q. Wilson, professor of management at the University of
California, Los Angeles, warns, &quot;There's a tornado coming.
We can't stop it.  We have to prepare for it.&quot;[24] The future
portends escalating violent crime and a growing need for prisons
and longer sentences unless something dramatic is done.

<p>

<center><h3>AMERICAN PRISONS: PUNISHMENT OR REHABILITATION?</h3></center>

<p>

The question that must be answered is, &quot;What are prisons
supposed to do?&quot;  The U.S. has a history of vacillating between
rehabilitation and punishment for inmates.  The pendulum is now
moving away from rehabilitation.

<p>

&quot;I'm sick and tired of these people getting by with murder
and rape and child molestation and just being allowed to be in
jail.&quot;[25] Illinois Senator Adeline Geo-Karis said these words
just before the state senate approved legislation setting up a
chain gang program. She explained, &quot;I say, let them out
in the rock pile to pay their penalty. No more mollycoddling!&quot;[26]

<p>

A 1995 <I>Time/CNN</I> poll found that two in three Americans
(67 percent) believe prisons are too lenient.[27] Two-thirds favor
chain gangs and half would deny inmates television and barbells.[28]
Texas Senator Phil Gramm says, &quot;We've got to stop building
prisons like Holiday Inns.&quot;[29]

<p>

Within the penal system, there are a variety of prisons and operating
philosophies.  There are ultra-maximum-security prisons like the
one near Florence, Colorado.  Here are housed the nation's 484
toughest federal prisoners.  The 428,000-square-foot facility
has 168 videocameras and 1,400 electronically controlled gates.
Each cell has unmovable cement furniture and a small black-and-white
TV.[30]

<p>

Despite its effectiveness, James Joy, Colorado's ACLU director,
says, &quot;The prison is designed to drive people crazy, to break
them psychologically, by locking them up with no meaningful human
contact.&quot;[31]

<p>

Sheriff Joe Arpaio runs a no-frills prison for Maricopa County,
Arizona. He has organized prisoners into chain gangs, houses
them in tents in the scorching desert sun and feeds them baloney
sandwiches with no coffee. Inmates are denied broadcast television
but given educational programming. &quot;I want to make this
place so unpleasant that they won't even think about doing something
that could bring them back,&quot; says Arpaio. &quot;I want them
to suffer.&quot;[32]

<p>

House Speaker Newt Gingrich has called for a fundamental overhaul
of the prison system.[33] He's joined by Rep. James Moran (D-Va.),
who wants a better balance between punishment and rehabilitation.
America needs &quot;an effective criminal justice system,&quot;
says Moran, &quot;not only punishing offenders, but also on teaching
the skills and discipline necessary to keep them from becoming
repeat offenders.&quot;[34]

<p>

The cadillac of prisons is located in Bradford, Pennsylvania.
McKean Medium-Security Prison is labeled by some as a &quot;resort&quot;
or &quot;country club.&quot;  The taxpayer pays $15,370 for each
inmate per year.[35]

<p>

DiIulio says, &quot;McKean is probably the best-managed prison
in the country, and that has everything to do with a warden named
Dennis Luther.&quot;  Luther's success is attributed to his philosophy
of building a &quot;prison culture&quot; that includes unconditional
respect for inmates as people.  Luther explains, &quot;If you
want people to behave responsibility, and treat you with respect,
then you treat other people that way.&quot;[36]

<p>

Nearly half (47 percent) of McKean inmates are enrolled in education
classes.  According to DiIulio, &quot;In some prison systems,
cost-effective management is possible only because programs keep
prisoners busy, with less supervision than you'd need otherwise.&quot;[37]

<p>

McKean is the exception among prisons.  Most prisons are by design
very inhospitable places.  William Weld, governor of Massachusetts,
expresses a widely-held view about prisons saying they should
be &quot;a tour through the circles of hell,&quot; where inmates
learn only &quot;the joys of busting rocks.&quot;  The fact that
most prisons are &quot;a tour through the circles of hell&quot;
explains why an inmate serving a life term in New Jersey said,
&quot;You create Spartan conditions, you're gonna get gladiators.&quot;[38]

<p>

This inmate's perspective is understandable and all too common.
According to former Arkansas corrections commissioner Don Hutto,
&quot;One prison I worked in had a sewage problem....But the state
budget people told me it would take four years to get the money
for a new sewage treatment plant....The inmates knew they were
at risk and they protested.  We had to discipline them, even though
they had a good case. It was like that with nearly all the projects
I tried to get started, and then people wonder why there's a prison
riot.&quot;[39]

<p>

Incarceration has at least four social benefits:  retribution,
deterrence, rehabilitation and incapacitation.[40] Recent trends
have been weighed more heavily on the side of retribution and
incapacitation. Meanwhile, prisoners are more diverse, harder
to control and often re-enter society better criminals than ever
before.  Evidence abounds that our penal system is failing to
curb recidivism and costs, and in many instances prisons serve
as advanced training centers for more sophisticated or violent
crimes.

<p>

Overcrowding is driving a rush to build new facilities, such as
in Texas, which has launched a prison construction boom to raise
its capacity from 38,000 in 1987 to 150,000 by 1997.[41] The U.S.
has 1,037 state and federal prisons which are operating at between
17 and 36 percent above capacity.[42]

<p>

Incarceration costs are also rising.  For 1995, states appropriated
$18 billion for corrections, making this the fastest-growing item
in state budgets.[43] According to the Justice Department, the average
annual spending per prisoner is $15,586 for the states and $14,456
for federal prisons.[44] These figures do not include hidden and
indirect costs which significantly elevate the outlays to anywhere
from $25,000 to $40,000 per prisoner.

<p>

A number of factors drive escalating costs -- more inmates, numerous
drug-addicted and violent offenders (who cost more to supervise
than other prisoners), more prison gangs and other anti-social
groups, diverse ethnic make-up, more elderly prisoners who require
special care, and the unprecedented explosion of prisoner lawsuits.
The most expensive prison service, however, is health care.

<p>

Prisoner health care takes 21 percent of the typical state's corrections
budget.[45] The high costs are dictated by the generally rising costs
of health care in society, but also because inmates are far more
likely to have chronic diseases like AIDS and tuberculosis than
the general population.  Annual health care costs per prisoner
range from $634 per inmate in Louisiana to $3,264 per inmate in
Massachusetts.[46]

<p>

<center><h3>PRISONS FOR PROFIT</h3></center>

<p>

Jimmy Turner, now a prison warden with the for-profit Corrections
Corporation of America (CCA), spoke of the Texas state prison
system, explaining, &quot;We were taught that communication only
went one way....A prisoner did what you told him. That works,
if you can afford to let prisoners get angry and tear up the place.
No one is going to care if he wrecks a $1,500 sink in his jail
cell. The state will foot the cost.&quot;[47]

<p>

Many states are seeking commercial prison alternatives because
costs are spiraling out of control.  CCA is the largest private
operator of prisons in the U.S.  The chairman of the CCA said,
&quot;It seemed such a logical idea when we started....As long
as there's a monopoly, there is going to be inefficiency, and
government is the biggest monopoly of all.&quot;[48]

<p>

CCA contends that it can build prisons cheaper and run them better
than can the government.  &quot;Anyone who has worked in prisons
learns pretty quickly that when people are treated humanely, in
a way that maintains their dignity, the environment is safer,&quot;
says Don Hutto, who helped found the corporation in 1983, &quot;but
that's not what often happens in public prisons.&quot;[49]

<p>

James Wiedenman, a CCA shift commander, prefers CCA's approach,
explaining, &quot;The atmosphere in those places [state-run prisons]
was awful....The prison administration was even more of an enemy
than the inmates were.  You didn't see the warden for more than
once in six months....Most of us [guards] got into this business
because we like what we do, but if I hadn't moved into the private
sector, I think I would have found another career.&quot;[50]

<p>

<center><h3>PRISON POPULATION</h3></center>

<p>

In 1994, 1.6 million people were in federal, state and local prisons
and/or jails.  That's 387 incarcerated Americans per 100,000 population,
up from 139 in 1980, making the U.S. the leading jailkeeper in
the western world.[51] More than half (60 percent)[52] of all federal
prisoners are serving time for drug-related offenses, while 94
percent[53] of state prisoners are serving time for violence-related
offenses.

<p>

Most prisoners have long criminal histories beginning with extensive
juvenile records. Two out of three prisoners have served time
in a juvenile institution, but their juvenile files are seldom
available to judges when deciding on adult sentences.[54]

<p>

What's more frightening than the offenses for which these inmates
are currently serving are those crimes they committed for which
they were never convicted.  In the late 1970s, the Rand Corporation
surveyed prisoners in Texas, Michigan and California and found
that the median number of admitted crimes committed by each inmate
in the year prior to their incarceration was 15.[55]

<P>

Most state inmates become hardened veterans of the prison system.
More than 60 percent have been incarcerated before, and nearly
all of these (91 percent) have been in jail or prison for an offense
within the five years preceding their current offense.[56] Convicted
rapists and murderers are by far the most likely of all felons
to return to prison.[57] Only 19 percent are serving their first
sentence.[58]

<P>

The typical prisoner is poorly educated.  Seven in 10 inmates
have no high school diploma, and most (66 percent) are illiterate
with limited marketable skills.[59] Three-quarters are drug or alcohol
abusers at the time of incarceration, and most female inmates
leave children behind when they go to prison.[60]

<P>

The prison culture is often as bad as or worse than the lifestyles
inmates left behind.  Prisons are filled with some of society's
worst offenders.  Besides a host of bad company, the prisoner
experiences many deprivations which include restricted movement,
loss of possessions, loss of autonomy, and reduced contact with
family. Prisoners live in a very regimented, highly regulated
environment designed to control every aspect of behavior.

<p>

Male prisoners must often fight to survive.  They must be constantly
on guard for personal safety.  Homosexual rape is common, especially
for new inmates.  Gangs often define and control the prison experience.

<p>

<center><h3>DOES PRISON REHABILITATION WORK?</h3></center>

<p>

The taxpayer has a right to expect the prison system to be more
than a holding tank or a revolving door for criminals.  Most prisons,
however, are little more than expensive warehouses within which
inmates finely hone their criminal skills.

<p>

A 1974 review of 231 prison rehabilitation studies found that
correctional treatment showed no effect on recidivism. Robert
Martinson published a review, &quot;What Works - Questions and
Answers About Prison Reform,&quot; which helped move the rehabilitation
pendulum toward &quot;nothing works.&quot;[61] But Martinson's analysis
lacks support from some contemporary experts.

<p>

&quot;You are not going to rehabilitate the chronic offender,&quot;
says DiIulio, &quot;but it is also wrong to say we are not going
to rehabilitate anybody.&quot;[62] Most prison officials agree.

<p>

In 1994, the Senate Judiciary Committee polled prison wardens
to discover their views on rehabilitation.  Wardens overwhelmingly
favor prison rehabilitation programs.  Ninety-three percent favor
literacy and other educational programs, 92 percent favor vocational
training, and 89 percent favor drug treatment.[63]

<p>

J. Michael Quinlan, a former director of the Federal Bureau of
Prisons, supports rehabilitation because it makes prison operations
more efficient.  &quot;It is absolutely the most important ingredient
in managing a safe and secure institution,&quot; says Quinlan,
&quot;to keep the inmates productively occupied, in either work
or education or drug treatment or structured recreation.&quot;[64]
Quinlan says, &quot;It is really a question of do we want to
pay now, or do we want to pay later.&quot;[65] Ninety-five percent
of inmates return to the streets. If they have been sitting idly
in prison, their chances of recidivating are higher than if they
have been involved in productive programs.[66]

<p>

Most prisoners are poor employment candidates.  A 1991 Justice
Department survey found that most (70 percent) prisoners earned
less than $15,000 in the year before their arrest.[67] A prison term
also worsens their job prospects.  These facts should support
efforts to increase inmate skills so as to improve their post-prison
employment chances.

<p>

A 1993 study by the Federal Bureau of Prisons found that many
prisoners want to participate in education programs to improve
their chances of finding a job, and thus not committing a crime
after release.[68] Numerous other studies have also found a strong
relationship between prison education and lower recidivism.[69]

<p>

Paul Barton, the co-author of a 1996 prison-based Educational
Testing Service study, found &quot;[s]olid information...about
how low the literacy level of prisoners is in relation to what
the job market needs.&quot;  Barton said, &quot;Education may
not be the sole answer to cutting recidivism, but the evidence
shows that it helps.&quot;[70]

<p>

Barton's study found that two-thirds of all inmates are substantially
behind the general population in literacy, even lower than the
average unskilled laborer. He said, &quot;They're not going to
make it when they get out. This is where a whole lot of our youth
are these days, especially minority youth.  For many of them,
it's their last chance for education.&quot;[71]

<p>

Prison-based work experience is another form of rehabilitation.
Thomas Townsend, president of the Corrections Industry Association,
says, &quot;It is a matter of public safety: inmates who have
worked in prison and gained new skills have a significantly better
chance of not returning to crime and prison.&quot;[72]

<p>

Former Attorney General Edwin Meese favors prison-based programs
as a means of reducing recidivism. &quot;Prison industries is
one management strategy that shows promise,&quot; explains Meese,
as a way to &quot;reduce recidivism and increase public safety.&quot;[73]

<p>

A 1991 Federal Bureau of Prisons study followed 7,000 inmates
after release.  Those who worked in prison had a 35 percent decrease
in recidivism the first year.[74] Prison-based work programs also
save on operating costs.

<p>

Prisoner wages are garnished to help pay for incarceration costs.
At least 25 states now have contracts with private firms that
employ inmates.[75] But such work programs are restricted by two
1930s-era federal laws that limit interstate commerce in prison-made
goods.

<p>

<center><h3>FAITH-BASED REHABILITATION PROGRAMS</h3></center>

<p>

Now that we have an overview of the prison problem and the most
popular approaches to dealing with the incarcerated, let's look
at other programs that have proven to be effective and most efficient
-- faith-based programs.

<p>

Todd Clear, a Rutgers University criminologist, says, &quot;Religious
programming is the single most common form of institutional program
for inmate management and rehabilitation.&quot;[76]

<p>

Jailhouse conversions are viewed skeptically by judges and parole
boards.  John Wiley, a UCLA law professor, cautions, &quot;There's
such an incentive to fabricate [a conversion] that it's difficult
to be convincing....The problem is that the best evidence of a
genuine conversion comes after the person leaves the prison.&quot;[77]

<p>

Wiley says people are often too quick to label conversions as
fake. &quot;Actually,&quot; says Wiley, &quot;prison is the kind
of environment that might well prompt a conversion.  It's a shattering...monkish
existence...a complete change in your life.  Sure, some turn to
the worst instincts.  But I don't think it's implausible that
some turn to the best.&quot;[78]

<p>

Todd Clear, who is also a fellow at the National Institute of
Justice, believes spiritual commitment makes a difference.  &quot;Prison
is designed as an experience to pull people out of their realities
so they can, in fact, confront who they are and what they've done
and try to commit to a different version of themselves....I mean,
we would want people who go to prison to admit that they did wrong....These
religious traditions fit into what we really want prison to do.&quot;[79]

<p>

Louisiana prison warden Cain agrees with Clear.  &quot;All these
men were looking for was something, just looking for something
to hang their hats on.  We ought to be ashamed for what we hadn't
done for them before. They were ready for God.  They were probably
more ready than anyone. Even though some of these people may
never be free from this place, they'll be free with eternal life.
That's what it's all about.&quot;[80]

<p>

Charles Adkins, an Indiana state prison official, says religion
is one of several rehabilitation avenues.[81] But it's the only approach
that addresses the root problem -- a moral crisis inside the inmate.

<p>

Paul Robinson, a law professor at Northwestern University, dissects
the root of crime.  Robinson asks, &quot;Why do people obey the
law?  People obey the law because they fear the disapproval of
their social group and because they generally see themselves as
moral beings who want to do the right thing as they perceive it.&quot;[82]
The fact that many offenders come from social settings that approve
of anti-social behavior might, in part, explain their crime history.

<p>

&quot;Reinforcing the compliance powers of the social group and
personal morality,&quot; says  Robinson, &quot;could reduce crime
even if policing and prosecuting functions cannot be made more
effective.&quot;[83] Perhaps  this is why religion has been effective
for some prisoners.  Inmates who simultaneously experience a changed
personal morality (salvation or conversion) and then are totally
immersed in a faith community experience religion's life-changing
power.

<p>

Religion serves four roles in prison.  First, it provides answers
to the prisoner's questions about life.  Second, it provides rules
to adhere to, which makes inmate management easier.  Third, it
is experiential. In other words, something intrinsic takes place
(salvation or conversion) which is evident to the inmate and later
to those around him. Finally, religion plays a social role bringing
together like-minded inmates for worship, Bible study and other
faith-related activities. This togetherness gives the inmate
a sense of belonging and positively impacts the prison's culture.[84]

<p>

There is evidence that religion helps make prisons more manageable.
A 1992 Rutgers University study found that prisoners often seek
God to cope with inmate life, which is marked by depression, guilt
and self-contempt.[85] Todd Clear, the Rutgers researcher, found
that highly religious inmates evidence lower rates of depression
and commit fewer disciplinary infractions than other inmates.
In another study, correctional officials from three states credited
Prison Fellowship's religious programming with improved morale,
lower rates of depression and fewer disciplinary infractions.[86]

<p>

Inmates who are highly religious while in prison also tend to
have lower recidivism rates. A 1990 Prison Fellowship study of
360 ex-convicts found that only 40 percent of those who were heavily
involved in religious programs committed new crimes after release
compared with 51 percent of the non-religious group.[87] Although
this isn't an especially large margin, it's better than recidivism
results attributed solely to education, work or drug treatment
programs.

<p>

A 1996 Prison Fellowship study of 201 inmates involved in religious
programs found that high participation in Bible studies is related
to lower likelihood of arrest during the one-year follow-up period.[88]
A 1992 Prison Fellowship study of 225 New York inmates also found
that high religious program participation meant lower odds of
being re-arrested.[89]

<p>

<center><h3>BRING MORE RELIGION TO PRISON</h3></center>

<p>

If religion works better than other forms of prison rehabilitation,
then the taxpayer ought to favor more religious programming.
There is a problem however and it has more to do with what goes
on inside the prison than laws separating church and state functions.

<p>

Suzanne McElwain, chief chaplain at the Luther Luckett Correctional
Complex, La Grange, Kentucky, says, &quot;It's not cool to be
a Christian on this yard.&quot;[90] She finds that many inmates believe
Christ was killed on the cross because he wasn't smart enough
to avoid it.

<p>

&quot;We've got a lot of unchurched men here,&quot; says McElwain,
&quot;a lot of unbelievers, and a lot of people with an unhealthy
(image of ) God.&quot;[91] If religion is to help change inmates,
these barriers must be removed.

<p>

One means of removing these barriers is to embrace a prison concept
that involves all inmates in a prison-wide faith-based program.
Sociologist Rodney Stark writes in the <I>Journal of Research
in Crime and Delinquency</I>, &quot;Religion only binds people
to the moral order if religious influences permeate the culture
and the social interactions of the individuals in question.&quot;[92]

<p>

A prison operated on a faith-based philosophy offers great promise.
Such an approach would introduce into the prison many desirable
attributes.  It opposes antisocial values, emphasizes responsibility
and accountability, advances non-deviant over socially deviant
behavior, promotes reconciliation, seeks to mediate conflict,
and champions social support and comfort for those in need.[93]

<p>

Although such a program is not for every inmate, it will work
for many.  For example, the Association for Protection and Assistance
of the Sentenced (APAC) is based on a unique prison model started
in Brazil 20 years ago.  The program restores inmates to responsible
and productive relationships with their communities, families
and Creator. It also promises to reduce prison costs and reduce
recidivism. Prison Fellowship researched the approach and found
that ex-convicts who completed the Brazilian program had an incredibly
low four percent recidivism rate.[94]

<p>

The first APAC program could be run in Texas by the Community
Corrections Institution, a faith-based nonprofit organization.
CCI proposes to run a corrections institution for Texas for 90
percent of the current per prisoner cost and promises to reduce
recidivism by half.[95]

<p>

CCI's program will provide jobs and job training for up to 500
residents per facility.  It will satisfy all statutory requirements
for a penal institution, and it guarantees accreditation by the
American Correctional Association.  It will teach inmates marketable
skills and assure that skills will be marketable upon release.
It will also pay prevailing wages for the skills learned.  Inmates
will contribute to room and board, support their families, make
restitution to victims, establish savings accounts and have spending
accounts.[96]

<p>

To be eligible for the CCI facility, inmates must be at least
one year, but no more than two years, from initial parole eligibility
or mandatory release.  They must agree to stay at least one year
and make themselves available for all programs, services and employment.[97]

<p>

On May 8, 1996, CCI representatives met with representatives of
the Texas Department of Criminal Justice System to discuss key
points of a Texas-based APAC program.[98] CCI answered the Justice
System's legal questions:

<p><ul>

<li>A corrections program may be authorized for management by
nongovernment participants to further state interests and secular
purposes. State interests include lower incarceration costs,
lower recidivism rates and lower, long-term state expenses.

<p>

<li>The state must give a contractor the discretion to provide
religious or values elements without necessarily causing impermissible
state endorsement, so long as inmates voluntarily participate.

<p>

<li>Nonreligious elements can be funded with direct state support,
but religious elements should not be funded without legal authority.

</ul><p>

CCI's proposal satisfies these legal requirements.

<p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

Bill Glass Prison Ministry goes across the country spreading the
Gospel to hungry inmates.  &quot;I give myself to going to prisons,&quot;
says Glass, &quot;because men in prison...have come to a point
they realize they have a need, and they're willing to trust the
Lord...and what we're trying to say is that you can have a new
life.&quot;[99]

<p>

Chuck Colson, Prison Fellowship's founder and himself a former
prisoner, says prison may just be one of the best places to start
over again.  &quot;The Gospel is better news in prison than anywhere
else,&quot; says Colson, &quot;because these people really understand
the depths of their own sin.&quot;[100]

<p>

Religious rehabilitation programs work for many prisons.  They
provide a moral compass for inmates who have been led astray by
a corrupted value system. Work, education and drug programs,
although important, can't change the inner man which is the target
of faith-based programs.

<p>

The prisoner who acquires an intrinsic faith has a better chance
to live a crime-free post-prison life.  For those who must remain,
they are easier (translated less costly) to manage.  The taxpayer
collects the benefits from a rehabilitation philosophy that embraces
the life-changing power of religious faith.  It is an experiment
well worth trying.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The American economy currently exhibits relatively low levels of inflation, interest rates, and unemployment. Yet millions of workers remain anxious about their economic security. The relatively good economic news, combined with the widespread dissatisfaction among Americans with the nation's economic performance, seems to be a paradox. But an analysis of underlying policies and economic trends suggests an answer to this puzzle.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Using the Washington University Macro Model (WUMM)<sup>1</sup> -- a major economic model of the U.S. economy also used by the federal government and many <I>Fortune</I> 500 companies -- economists at The Heritage Foundation investigated how the economy would likely be performing today had Congress not raised taxes in 1993 as the nation was coming out of the 1990-1991 recession.<sup>2</sup>  The results of this analysis shed light on why Americans are so anxious about the economy's performance. According to the Heritage analysis, the 1993 tax hike, championed by the Clinton White House, did indeed produce what some critics have referred to as a "Clinton Crunch" -- a larger tax bite for families combined with a stagnation in incomes and an economy performing well below its potential.<sup>3</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Heritage analysis indicates that, compared with how the economy would have performed without the 1993 tax legislation, Clinton's 1993 tax and budget plan will have:
<img src="bg1078t1.gif" width=408 height=459 border=0 alt="Table 1" align=right><ul><P>
<li><b>Cost the economy $208 billion in output</b> from 1993 through 1996,<sup>4</sup> in today's dollars.<sup>5</sup>  This lost output is equal to nearly $2,100 for every household in America. Last year, without the 1993 economic package, gross domestic product (GDP) would have grown $66 billion more than it actually did absent the change.
<p>
<li><b>Cut the number of private jobs created by 1.2 million</b> between 1993 and the end of 1996. Including the forecast for 1997, the total employment cost of the 1993 tax increase grows to nearly 1.4 million lost job opportunities.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
<li><b>Delivered only 49 percent of the new revenues predicted</b> by the Congressional Budget Office from the increase in personal and corporate tax rates between FY 1994 and FY 1996. When compared with the 1.2 million lost jobs, the tax hike has depressed potential employment growth by 17,600 jobs for every $1 billion it achieved in deficit reduction.
<p>
<li><b>Cut $112 billion, in today's dollars, out of potential employee wages and salaries</b> between 1993 and 1996.
<p>
<li><b>Cut the growth in real personal disposable income</b> of Americans by $264 billion in today's dollars between 1993 and 1996 -- equal to over $2,600 less disposable income for every household in America.
<p>
<li><b>Cut the potential sale of automobiles by 773,700 and light trucks by 504,000</b> between 1993 and 1996. Some 1.1 million of the nearly 1.3 million <a href="bg1078c5.gif">lost vehicle sales</a> would have been produced domestically. In 1996, Heritage calculates that this loss in auto and truck sales will cost a projected 60,100 jobs across all industries.
<p>
<li><b>Cut the value of business investment in durable goods by $42.5 billion</b> in today's dollars; $15.4 billion of this is lost investment in computers.
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Some proponents may argue that even if the economy is not performing up to its potential today, this slow growth period is necessary to reduce federal deficit spending which, in turn, will promote greater future growth. Yet many respected economists maintain that this will not be the case with the 1993 tax increase and budget deal: Increased taxes (and particularly increased marginal tax rates) will permanently decrease economic activity below its potential.<sup>7</sup>  Similarly, the Heritage analysis, using the WUMM economic model and forecasts of future economic activity, supports this theory. According to the Heritage analysis, nearly every major economic indicator is projected to be weaker under current law than would have been possible without passage of the 1993 tax increase and budget act between now and 2004. Specifically:
<ul><P>
<li><b>Gross domestic product is projected to be lower in each year.</b> In 2004 alone, GDP is projected to be $122.5 billion lower in today's dollars than would have been possible without passage of the 1993 tax increase and budget deal.
<p>
<li><b>Real personal disposable income is projected to be lower each year.</b> In 2004 alone, Americans will see $142 billion less in disposable income than would be possible without the 1993 tax increase and budget deal.
</ul><P>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In short, American workers are right to feel that they should be better off today than they are. President Clinton's 1993 economic plan turns out to have deprived Americans of a higher standard of living by cutting the economy's growth potential, leading to a slower rise in employee compensation, household income, industrial output, and most other measures of a prosperous economy. 
<p>
<b>HOW IS THE ECONOMY REALLY PERFORMING?</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Despite a flow of quite good economic news in recent months, many Americans feel anxious about their economic security, complaining of stagnating family incomes, less money in their paychecks after taxes, and a belief that the economy is performing below its full potential. They simply do not accept that the economy is, as the President claims, the "healthiest it has been in 30 years." 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In the latest <I>Economic Report of the President</I>, the White House maintains that the general health of the economy is good and credits the creation of 8 million new jobs to the passage of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA-93), which, the report says, "set the stage for this economic expansion and resurgence, by enacting historic deficit reduction while continuing to invest in technology and education."<sup>8</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
By contrast, House Majority Leader Richard Armey (R-TX) cites OBRA-93, which enacted the largest tax increase in history, as the culprit for the anxiety Americans are now feeling. Calling this condition the <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/lect556.html">"Clinton Crunch,"</a><sup>9</sup> Armey claims workers are experiencing the dual effect of an actual decline in real wages and higher taxes. With fewer of their own dollars in their pockets to meet the needs of their families, he says, workers understandably have a heightened sensitivity to changing economic conditions, corporate layoffs, and downsizing.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Who is right?  Is the economy performing up to its potential, as claimed by the White House?  Or are Americans suffering from the "Clinton Crunch," as claimed by Armey?
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Americans have good reason to be confused about the direction in which the nation's economy is headed. On the one hand, there is good news in statistics showing continued economic growth, relatively low unemployment, and record highs in the stock market. And as the Clinton Administration points out, the economy has created nearly 8 million jobs over the past three years, 93 percent of them in the private sector. Clinton also claims credit for reducing the federal budget deficit for three consecutive years: According to the <I>Economic Report of the President</I>, passage of the 1993 economic plan "put the country solidly on the road to fiscal responsibility."<sup>10</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But other economic statistics indicate a less rosy picture for Americans in recent years. For example, existing studies and government data indicate: 
<p><ul>
<li> Since 1992, real median family income has stagnated even though more adult women are working than ever before.<sup>11</sup>  Since September 1993, both real average hourly earnings and real average weekly earnings have stagnated.<sup>12</sup>
<P>
<li>Since the third quarter of 1993, the real median weekly earnings for women have decreased 3.0 percent, while men's real earnings have stagnated.<sup>13</sup>  Over the same period, real hourly compensation (which includes benefits as well as wages) has not increased significantly.<sup>14</sup>
<p>
<li>Fifty percent of major U.S. companies eliminated jobs in the twelve months ending June 1995, up from 47 percent the year before.<sup>15</sup>
<p>
<li>More Americans are working two or more jobs to make ends meet. In March 1996, 7.9 million Americans were working two or more jobs, up 10.2 percent since March 1994.<sup>16</sup>
<p>
<li>Less than one-third of all workers displaced from full-time jobs found new jobs that pay the same as their old ones.<sup>17</sup>   The median weekly earnings of their new jobs averaged 8.2 percent less than their old jobs, and over 14 percent less for workers 45 to 55 years old.<sup>18</sup>
<p>
<li>
From March 1995 to March 1996, 325,000 high-paying manufacturing jobs disappeared.<sup>19</sup>
</ul><p>
<b>THE ECONOMY IS LAGGING BEHIND PREVIOUS EXPANSIONS</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thus, while the economy is no longer in a recession, and indeed is experiencing modest growth, many Americans are still having trouble making ends meet and corporate layoffs have many workers thinking twice about the security of their jobs. But is this just part of a typical business cycle?  Experience suggests "no."  Although total employment has increased in recent years, the current economic expansion -- which began in March 1991 and is now some 59 months long -- is not progressing as well as it should when compared with the three previous post-World War II expansions lasting longer than 58 months. These expansions occurred from February 1961 to December 1969, from March 1975 to January 1980, and from November 1982 to July 1990.<sup>20</sup>  The failure of this economy to perform as well as similar expansions gives a clue as to why many Americans are concerned about their economic future.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It is interesting to compare this expansion with the average of these previous expansions. To be sure, the patterns of each expansion do differ, so data for each expansion are provided in <a href="bg1078t2.gif">Table 2</a>, as well as the average. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
During the current expansion:
<ul><p>
<li>The gross domestic product has increased less than half as much as the average of previous post-war recoveries. Industrial production has increased just over half as much.
<p>
<li><a href="bg1078t2.gif">Total employment</a> has grown only half as much as the average of previous post-war recoveries.
<p>
<li>The number of high-paying manufacturing jobs has <I>declined</I> by 273,000, compared with an average <I>increase</I> of almost 2 million at a similar point during previous economic expansions.
<p>
<li>The number of unemployed Americans has declined by less than half the number during previous economic expansions.
<p>
<li>Real median family income has <I>declined</I> by a total of 3.2 percent during the first four years of this expansion, compared with an average <I>increase</I> of 8.8 percent during the first four years of previous expansions.<sup>21</sup> 
<p>
<li>Real median weekly earnings for full-time workers have <I>declined</I> by 2.6 percent during the current expansion, compared with an <I>increase</I> of 3.1 percent during the 1982 to 1986 expansion.<sup>22</sup>
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thus, despite the Administration's cheerful outlook, the economy is not performing well when compared with similar points during the three previous expansions of similar lengths. The question is "why?"  Would the economy have been performing less well today without OBRA-93, as the Clinton Administration claims, or did the tax increase slow down an economy in recovery and put many workers into a wage and job squeeze, as critics claim?
<p>
<b>THE 1993 BUDGET DEAL</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Virtually all economists agree that Washington can alter the course of the economy to some degree through its tax and spending decisions. This influence is particularly evident when Congress and the President enact tax and spending policies that affect income from work or investment. For example, Washington can reduce employment and workers' take-home pay by increasing tax rates on wages and salaries. Higher rates take money directly out of workers' pockets and make work less attractive. Conversely, lower tax rates increase the incentives for men and women to work, start new businesses, or invest in training and equipment for workers. In short, tax rate changes either lower or raise the cost of labor, depending on the direction of the rate movement. Commonly, lowering labor costs leads to a higher demand for labor. When combined with lower capital costs stemming from lower taxes on capital, greater levels of economic activity are attained.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
When Congress and the President adopt policies that alter economic life in some significant fashion, there will be a difference between how the economy then performs and how it would have performed had policy not been changed. These differences between actual and potential performance can be estimated statistically using models of the U.S. economy that capture the economic impact of policy changes. Generally speaking, these models allow analysts to "simulate" the impact of tax and spending decisions that could have been made -- or not made -- by Congress and the President, and then compare the simulation with what actually occurred. This is what the Congressional Budget Office routinely does when Congress is considering tax and spending legislation.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
There have been two major tax and spending plans enacted in recent years. These were in 1990 and 1993. American taxpayers were told that large tax increases in each of these plans would lead to a significant reduction in federal deficits and spur long-term economic growth. In this study, Heritage analysts used the WUMM model to investigate the effects of the 1993 budget deal. There were two reasons for the decision to focus on the 1993 agreement: First, by 1993, the economy was largely in recovery from the 1990-1991 recession, so the impact on the expansion of the 1993 plan could be isolated more easily. And, second, focusing on the 1993 economic plan allowed analysts to test the Clinton thesis that the plan has produced "the healthiest economy in three decades."<sup>23</sup>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The 1993 budget plan (OBRA-93) raised taxes $241 billion over five years and called for $77 billion in entitlement program savings and $69 billion in discretionary program savings by 1998.<sup>24</sup>  The tax law changes included two new personal tax brackets (36 and 39.6 percent) and an extension of the Medicare payroll tax to cover all wages. The motor fuel tax was increased 4.3 cents per gallon, and the tax on Social Security recipients' income from personal savings was increased. Congress and the President agreed to raise the corporation income tax to 35 percent and to restrict business meal and entertainment deductions. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The small entitlement savings came mostly from reductions in Medicare payments to doctors and hospitals and increased charges to Medicare beneficiaries. OBRA-93 delayed cost of living adjustments for military and civil service retirees and limited Medicaid payments to the states. Small reductions also were made in veterans benefits, farm programs, and student loans.
<p>
<b>THE FINDINGS</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The comparison of the real and simulated economies suggests that OBRA-93 was not as beneficial to the economy as the White House claims. Indeed, it damaged the economy and living standards in several ways. Specifically, the Heritage analysis finds that:
<ol><p>
<b><li>Economic growth has been slowed. </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The economy would have grown significantly faster without the Clinton tax increases and spending reductions of 1993. These policy changes will have cost the economy <a href="bg1078c2.gif">$208 billion</a> in today's dollars in output from 1993 through 1996, equivalent to nearly $2,100 in lost GDP for every household in America. In 1995, GDP would have grown by nearly 0.90 percent more, or $66 billion in today's dollars, than it actually did. The model forecasts that GDP in 1997 will be 1.0 percent lower than it could be without the 1993 tax hike, or about $95.5 billion in today's dollars.
<p>
<b><li> The pace of business formation has been slowed. </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Heritage analysis shows more new businesses would have been incorporated without Clinton's 1993 package. This is due to the relationship between gross domestic product and new business incorporation. In general, for every $1 billion in GDP, about 195 new businesses are incorporated. Thus, the $208 billion fall in GDP due to the 1993 legislation will have prevented the formation of 40,600 new businesses between 1993 and the end of 1996.<sup>25</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>What This Means:</b> The loss of new businesses means not only a loss of valuable entrepreneurs, but also the loss of many new jobs. The Small Business Administration (SBA) estimates that five new jobs are created with each new business establishment. Using the SBA estimate, the loss of 40,600 new businesses between 1993 and 1996 will have meant the loss of 203,000 new jobs.
<p>
<b><li>Job growth has been slowed. </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The economy produced 1.2 million fewer private sector jobs between 1993 and 1996 than it would have without the tax increase and budget changes of 1993. President Clinton claims credit for more than eight million new jobs during his Administration, so far, with roughly seven million of these in the private sector. But the Heritage analysis indicates that 1.2 million <I>additional</I> Americans could have been working without his policy changes. If the forecast for 1997 is added to these figures, the total private employment cost of the tax increase grows to nearly 1.4 million.<sup>26</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It must be noted that the loss of potential civilian employment is one of the more remarkable findings of the analysis, based on the model's design. It is also one of the more controversial. While it is the Heritage Foundation's policy to accept the model's macroeconomic results and assumptions (other than the action of the Fed -- see box, page 8) and not make adjustments in these results through statistical work performed outside the model, this particular effect of OBRA-93 deserves a brief explanation. The model's measurement of how much employment will change when taxes change (the so-called tax elasticity of employment) sits roughly in the middle of the professionally accepted range for such measurements: The model contains a factor of .29 percent change for every one percent change in labor income, and the standard range among economists goes from .12 to .37 percent. These elasticities mean that a 10 percent increase in take-home pay leads to an increase in the labor supply of between 1.2 and 3.7 percent. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The designers of the WUMM model caution users regarding the output of the model's employment equations. However, Heritage economists decided to accept the model's results because further investigations and calculations using other data bases gave general support to the conclusions in this Heritage study. If the rate changes associated with OBRA-93's increases in payroll and income taxes are applied only to the incomes of those with more than $70,000 in income, we calculate that potential employment was at least 350,000. Of course, the increase in tax rates also negatively affected investment decisions, which resulted in slower growth of job-creating new businesses and business expansion. For example, Heritage calculates that the loss in potential capital stock may account for an additional decrease of 470,000 jobs. When these and other capital effects are combined with the direct and minimal employment effects, the calculation derived from the model of 1.2 million in 1996 between actual and potential employment appears reasonable.<sup>27</sup>  Even using lower elasticities favored by some economists would mean an employment effect of at least 400,000 lost jobs.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>What This Means:</b> Heritage calculates approximately 203,000 of the potential lost jobs between 1993 and the end of 1996 were a result of new businesses that were not formed. The remainder of lost potential jobs, some 1 million, most probably results from existing businesses that hired fewer employees than they otherwise would have or expanded less.
<p>
<b><li>The growth in household income and savings has been cut. </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
When the job losses are combined with higher taxes on working families, a disturbing picture of lost household income growth emerges. 
<p><ul>
<li><b>The growth in wages and salaries has been cut.</b> The 1993 legislation will have cut $112 billion, in today's dollars, out of employee wages and salaries between 1993 and 1996, when compared with the pattern that otherwise would have occurred. Extending the analysis to 1997 would mean $162 billion in total lost wages and salaries, again in today's dollars.
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>What This Means:</b> In 1996 alone, the Heritage analysis shows that the Clinton program depressed the growth in wages and salaries by $46.5 billion in today's dollars, roughly $465 for every household in America. The loss of potential income means that families spent less than they could have spent on food, clothing, transportation, medical care, and other necessities for their families. Indeed, in a typical month, the average household spends $251 on groceries, $160 on medical costs, and $40 on education.<sup>28</sup>  The addition of $465 in purchasing power for the typical household means an average of 1.8 months of groceries, or 2.9 months of medical bills, or 12 months of educational expenses in a typical year.
<ul><p>
<li><b>The growth in personal disposable income has been cut.</b> The 1993 budget deal raised taxes on millions of American households and will have cut overall real personal disposable income by $264 billion in today's dollars from 1993 through 1996 -- equal to over $2,600 less disposable income for every household in America. In 1996, households will have nearly 2 percent, or $101 billion, less money to spend on education, food, medical care, and other items than they would have had without the 1993 legislation.
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>What This Means:</b> Total personal disposable income measures both wage income and non-wage income from such things as investments. Besides lost future wages, the Heritage analysis shows that the Clinton tax increase and budget plan will have cost households $152 billion in non-wage income, in today's dollars, between 1993 and the end of 1996. This is equal to $1,500 for every American household. In 1996 alone, the average household will realize $550 less in non-wage disposable income, nearly double the amount the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates the average household spends on appliances each year.<sup>29</sup>  Many households use income from non-wage sources to make large purchases such as the down payment on a new car, a washing machine, and other appliances. Alternatively, families may use this income to finance extraordinary events such as weddings, college education, or vacations.
<p><ul>
<li><b>The growth in personal savings has been cut.</b> Between 1993 and the end of 1996, the 1993 budget plan will have reduced personal savings by roughly $138 billion in today's dollars. This cut in family savings means that future consumption of the things for which families save, principally housing and education, will be lower than it would have been. If 1997 is included, savings will have been cut by a total of $192 billion, in today's dollars.
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>What This Means:</b> The three things households save for most are education, housing, and retirement. To illustrate the impact of these lost savings, Heritage analysts distributed the $138 billion in lost savings to families with children, young families saving to purchase a home, and those saving for retirement, based upon age and population. We then assumed that this amount would grow at an everyday interest rate of 5 percent, to see what important purchases these three groups could make in the future with their respective accumulated savings. Each of the following amounts is what could be purchased with the future value of each group's portion of the $138 billion in lost savings:<sup>30</sup>
<p><ul>
<li>$432 billion for higher education expenses; and
<p>
<li>$335 billion for buying homes; and
<p>
<li>$3.6 trillion for retirement.
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Had the portion of this $138 billion we allocated to families with children been allowed to earn interest for the average number of years available for savings in the under-18 age group, then the cumulative amount could have purchased a four-year college education for 7 million students at $14,000. Had the foregone savings we allocated to young families saving to purchase a home (the age group 18 to 35), been allowed to grow for 18 years, the total sum could have resulted in 17 million future home sales where a $20,000 down payment is required. And had the portion of this $138 billion allocated to people above the age of 35 -- those saving for retirement -- been allowed to grow for the average number of years before this cohort retires, the future value could have resulted in 6.4 million 15-year retirement annuities paying $37,500 per year.
<p><ul>
<li><b>The growth of household wealth has been cut.</b> The 1993 legislation will have reduced the growth of household net wealth by $111 billion from between 1993 and 1996. The WUMM model defines net household wealth as a sum of personal savings, the purchase of automobiles and other durables, the existing household stock of durable goods and personal capital gains.
</ul><p>
<b><li>The reduction in the deficit attributable to the 1993 plan has been small. </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The President maintains that taxes had to be raised in 1993 to reduce mounting federal debt.<sup>31</sup>  He now points to a fall in the deficit as justification for the 1993 legislation. But the Heritage analysis indicates that the weak economy produced by the tax hike will have generated far less new revenue, and thus less deficit reduction, than the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) had predicted for FY 1994 through the end of FY 1996. On the other hand, the analysis indicates that the modest amount of savings predicted from the spending cuts will materialize. These findings suggest that if OBRA-93 had enacted few or no tax increases to slow the economy, but more spending cuts, the deficit would be far less today than it is.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In 1993, CBO predicted that OBRA-93 would lower the cumulative deficits between FY 1994 and FY 1996 by $171 billion. Some $50 billion of these savings -- 29 percent of the total -- was to come from spending cuts, including $17 billion in net interest savings and asset sale proceeds. The remaining $121 billion in deficit reduction -- 70 percent of the total -- was to come from the new revenues generated by the increase in tax rates.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Heritage analysis indicates that OBRA-93 will have produced just 74 percent of the deficit reduction CBO had estimated, or a total of $127 billion.<sup>32</sup>  This, however, does not tell the whole story. While the spending cuts will have produced slightly more savings than CBO predicted, $52 billion (excluding asset sale proceeds), accounting for 41 percent of the overall deficit reduction achieved,<sup>33</sup> the tax increase accounts for roughly 54 percent of the total, having delivered far less new revenue than was promised. 
<p><ul>
<li>The Heritage analysis shows that the tax increase will have produced just $68 billion in actual deficit reduction between FY 1994 and the end of FY 1996, just 56 cents of actual deficit reduction for every new dollar CBO predicted would be generated.
<p>
<li>However, excluding the roughly $16 billion in new revenues generated by the increase in the motor fuels tax, the analysis shows that the increase in personal and corporate tax rates produced only 49 percent of the new revenues CBO predicted would be generated.
<p>
<li>Thus, comparing the actual amount of deficit reduction produced by the 1993 tax hike between 1994 and 1996, with the 1.2 million potential new jobs lost, it can be said that the 1993 tax increase will have meant the loss of over 17,600 new jobs for every $1 billion it achieved in deficit reduction.
</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Heritage analysis of the near-term consequences of the 1993 tax increase largely confirms the results of a recent study by noted Harvard University economist Martin Feldstein and Daniel Feenberg, an economist at the National Bureau of Economic Research. Their analysis of the impact of the 1993 tax increase on individual behavior shows that the higher tax rates placed on upper-income taxpayers encouraged these individuals to change their economic behavior and, thus, report lower taxable income. As a result, in the first year it took effect, the 1993 tax rate increase raised just 45 percent of the "revenue that would have been collected if taxpayers had not changed their behavior."<sup>34</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Moreover, Feldstein and Feenberg discovered that the 1993 tax hike caused considerable inefficiencies in the economy, what economists call "deadweight losses."  "This means that for every dollar of additional revenue collected by the government as a result of the higher tax rates, taxpayers experience a decline in their well-being equivalent to three dollars as a result of the induced changes in work, in the form of compensation, and in tax deductible expenditures."<sup>35</sup>  In other words, conclude Feldstein and Feenberg, "the structure of the 1993 tax increase thus made it a very inefficient way of increasing revenue."<sup>36</sup>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This analysis so far has examined what might be called the short-term effects of the 1993 package. The current debate is about these short term effects, with the White House claiming benefits to today's economy. But for there to be a complete verdict on the 1993 tax and budget plan, one needs to project into the future, to explore whether the short-term effects analyzed above are merely a prelude to future growth.
</ol><p>
<b>THE LONG-TERM PICTURE</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To estimate the longer-run future effects of the 1993 plan, Heritage analysts used the WUMM model to extend the simulation of potential economic performance without passage of the 1993 tax increase and budget deal through 2004. The results of this simulation were then compared with the baseline economic projections -- under current law and including the 1993 tax increase and budget deal -- produced by the owners of the WUMM model in December 1995. The comparison shows that nearly every major economic indicator is projected to be weaker under current law than would have been possible without passage of the 1993 tax increase and budget act between now and 2004. Specifically, the Heritage analysis concludes: 
<p><ul>
<li><a href="bg1078c4.gif">Gross domestic product</a> is projected to be lower in each year. In 2004 alone, GDP is projected to be $122.5 billion lower in today's dollars than would have been possible without passage of the 1993 tax increase and budget deal.
<p>
<li>Real personal disposable income is projected to be lower each year. In 2004 alone, Americans will see $142 billion less in disposable income than would be possible without the 1993 tax increase and budget deal.
<p>
<li>Employment is projected to be less in every year. By 2004, 1.5 million fewer jobs will be created because of the 1993 tax increase and budget deal.
</ul><p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While there is good news in the economy, such as low interest rates, low inflation, 8 million new jobs, and lower federal deficits, many workers and their families feel that the recovery is anemic as far as they are concerned. The Clinton Administration is taking credit for good economic news and asserts that the news is a justification of its economic policies; specifically, the 1993 budget deal, which included the largest tax increase in history.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The evidence does not support the Administration's claim that the 1993 budget plan triggered stronger economic growth. On the contrary, the critics of the 1993 legislation appear to be correct that because of it Americans are caught in what some refer to as the "Clinton Crunch," the dual effect of declining real wages combined with higher taxes. The analysis by Heritage Foundation economists, using the WUMM model, indicates that OBRA-93 has had a damaging impact on the nation's economy. Removing the effects of OBRA-93 in an econometric simulation shows that the economy would have been performing better today had Congress not enacted the legislation. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Thus, President Clinton is right to point to the 1993 budget deal as creating today's economic climate. But rather than create a better climate, the legislation has cast a dark shadow over the economy.

<p>
<b>Notes on the Simulation</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The simulation of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (OBRA-93) was developed using the Washington University Macroeconomic Model of the United States economy. The baseline is that produced by the model in December 1995. Only those variables in the model that reflect federal tax and spending policies were modified to create the simulation. Both the baseline case and the simulation incorporated the model's Federal Reserve reaction function. Specifically, Heritage economists made the following decisions regarding tax and spending data inputted into the model for the simulation:<sup>37</sup>
<p><ul>
<li><b>Tax Changes</b> -- Most changes in tax policy were initiated in the first quarter of 1993 to account for the retroactive nature of the tax increases included in OBRA-93. 
<p>
1. The maximum federal corporate tax rate was restored to its "pre-OBRA-93" level to account for the one percentage point rate increase included in OBRA-93.
<p>
2. The statutory depreciation period for nonresidential structures was restored to its "pre-OBRA-93" level of 31.5 years. The corporate capital consumption allowance, as a percentage of total capital consumption allowance, was increased to accommodate the shorter depreciation periods within the simulation.
<p>
3. The federal statutory income-weighted marginal tax rates on wages, dividends, and interest were restored to their "pre-OBRA-93" levels.
<p>
4. The average federal personal tax rate was adjusted to account for lower marginal tax rates within the simulation compared to actual levels.
<p>
5. The federal statutory income-weighted marginal Social Security tax rate on wages and salaries was re-set to its "pre-OBRA-93" level.
<p>
6. Federal collections from social insurance taxes were adjusted to account for the repeal of the cap on earnings subject to the Medicare tax.
<p>
7. Federal collections from indirect business taxes were adjusted for the extension and increase of the motor fuels tax account.
<p>
8. Federal collections from business taxes were adjusted to account for non-rate changes in the business income tax code.
<p>

<li><b>Mandatory Spending Changes </b>
<p>
1. The actual spending level for <b>Medicare</b> was increased for each fiscal year by the amount the Congressional Budget Office estimated in September 1993 that OBRA-93 changes would save -- a total of $55.8 billion between 1994 and 1998. 
<p>
2. The actual spending level for <b>Medicaid</b> transfers was increased for each fiscal year by the amount the Congressional Budget Office estimated in September 1993 that OBRA-93 changes would save -- a total of $7.1 billion between 1994 and 1998.
<p>
3. The actual spending level for personal transfers was adjusted for each fiscal year by the amount the Congressional Budget Office estimated in September 1993 that OBRA-93 changes in <b>federal employee retirement and health benefits, veteran benefits</b>, and the <b>Earned Income Tax Credit</b> would create -- a net total of $6.7 billion of increased spending between 1994 and 1998. The increased spending for the Earned Income Tax Credit more than offset the savings from reforming federal employee retirement and health benefits, and veterans benefits. Therefore, the simulation actually calls for less spending on personal transfers than actually occurred during the past three years.
<p>
4. The actual spending level for other grants-in-aid was adjusted for each fiscal year by the amount the Congressional Budget Office estimated in September 1993 that OBRA-93 changes in <b>federal farm programs</b>, the <b>food stamp program</b>, and <b>"other" mandatory programs</b> would save -- a net total of $7.2 billion between 1994 and 1998.
<p>
5.  The proceeds from FCC electromagnetic spectrum auctions and the savings from changes in federal family education loans were added to the unified deficit but not included in the NIPA-based spending accounts.
<p>
<li><b>Discretionary Spending Changes</b> -- The actual spending levels for <b>non-defense purchases, defense purchases, and federal grants</b> to state and local governments were adjusted for each fiscal year by the amount the Congressional Budget Office estimated in September 1993 that OBRA-93 changes in discretionary spending would save -- a total of $68.5 billion between 1994 and 1998. This was evenly distributed among the three separate accounts.
<p>
<li><b>Spending Projections FY 1999 - FY 2004</b> -- CBO September 1993 estimates extended through FY 1998. For fiscal years 1999 through 2004, the underlying growth rates were assumed.
</ul><P>

<b>Other Technical Notes</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Personal Savings</b> -- The Heritage analysis concludes, among other things, that the tax policy changes of 1993 undercut personal savings by $138 billion. The estimates of long-term consumption effects were calculated as follows. The foregone personal savings were distributed across an array of seven age groupings by the percentage of people that fall in each grouping. This array consists of population estimates made by the U.S. Bureau of the Census for 1995.<sup>38</sup> 
<p>
<li>For those people 18 years old or less, the distributed personal savings were allowed to grow until their 18th year at a compounded rate of 5 percent. The sum of this compounding ($432 billion) was divided by $14,000 to arrive at the estimate of 7 million people who could pay for four years of state university education. 
<p>
<li>For those people between the ages of 18 and 35, the distributed personal savings were allowed to grow at a compounded annual rate of 5 percent until their 35th birthday. The sum of this compounding ($335 billion) was divided by $20,000 to arrive at the estimate of 17 million home sales that might be effected by potential home purchasers having $20,000 for a down payment and other home-buying costs. 
<p>
<li>For those people between the ages of 35 and 65, the distributed savings were allowed to grow at a compounded annual rate of 5 percent until their 65th birthday. The sum of this compounding was $3.6 trillion. To this sum was added the amount of distributed personal savings for people above age 65. It was assumed that this amount is consumed as it is received. Therefore, the total amount available for retirement was $3.6 trillion. This $3.6 trillion estimate was divided by $37,500 (an estimate of annual living costs at retirement for the cohort aged 35 and above) to arrive at the estimate of 6.4 million 15-year retirement annuities.

<li>Most of the change in earnings can be accounted for by the loss in firm-size wage premiums as workers have moved from larger to smaller firms.  All else being equal, larger firms pay 12 to 23 percent more than smaller firms.

<li>The data comparisons made in this section refer to similar points in time during these four expansions.  For example, average employment growth from March 1991 to the present (59 months) is compared with the average employment growth from February 1961 to December 1965 (59 months), from March 1975 to January 1980, and from November 1982 to October 1987.<p>

<li>Data on median weekly earnings are not available on a consistent basis prior to 1979.<p>
<li>There are limits to the historical changes economists can make in structural macroeconomic models.  Clearly the major limitation is the time period.  While economies rarely experience major changes in the span of a few years, structural stability is far less likely over longer time periods.  The six years of changes in variables in the WUMM model needed to measure the 1990 tax increase would have stretched prudent econometric practice to its limits.  A number of prominent macroeconomists have written on the deleterious effects of the 1990 budget deal.  For a summary of these viewpoints, see Daniel J.  Mitchell, "The Impact of Higher Taxes:  More Spending, Economic Stagnation, Fewer Jobs, and Higher Deficits," Heritage Foundation <I>Backgrounder</I> No.  925, February 10, 1993, and Daniel J.  Mitchell, "Why Higher Tax Rates on Income Will Slow Growth, Cost Jobs," Heritage Foundation <I>Backgrounder</I> No.  942, May 25, 1993.<P>
<li>Congressional Budget Office, <I>The Economic and Budget Outlook:  An Update</I> (Washington, D.C.:  U.S.  Government Printing Office, 1993), Table 2-2, p.  29.<p>
<li>This estimate is derived from a statistical analysis of the relationship between the number of new business incorporations and real GDP over the period 1959-1994.  Overall a decrease in GDP of $1 billion was found to be associated with a decrease in the number of new business incorporations by an average of 194.957 over this period.  (The estimate had an R-squared of .92748, a standard error of 9.35, and a t-statistic of 20.852.) Multiplying this figure by the $208 billion lost from GDP over 1993-96 (as a result of the Clinton tax increase) gave an estimate of 40,600 fewer new businesses.  Figures for GDP and business formation came from the 1995 and the 1996 <I>Economic Report of the President</I> (Washington, D.C.:  U.S.  Government Printing Office, 1996), Tables B-2 and B-92, respectively, pp.  282, 385.   <P>
<li>The estimate of lost potential employment results from increases in taxes on the wages and salaries of upper income Americans, on the income of corporations, and on capital, an effect that stems from lengthening the period of depreciation on capital goods as well as taxing interest, dividends, and capital gains at higher rates.  Such tax increases reduce capital formation and promote consumption.  By increasing both the cost of capital and the cost of additional labor, the rate of business expansion and formation falls below potential which, in turn, reduces the potential growth of employment.<p>
<li>Most labor economists view tax increases as being equivalent to wage decreases, but they hold sharply divergent views about the degree of change in employment that results from a change in the tax rate on labor income.  See Mark Killingsworth, <I>Labor Supply</I> (New York:  Cambridge University Press, 1983), Chapter 6, esp.  pp.  356-360.  This variation in the amount of labor that is supplied as the wage level changes is called the "wage or income supply elasticity of labor."  More specifically, the supply elasticity of labor is a measurement of the percentage change in the amount of labor that is supplied from a one percent change in the compensation of labor.  The professional literature contains estimates of the labor supply elasticity that range from.  12 to.  37 percent for every one percent change in total labor income (which become negatively signed when analyzing the effect of taxes on labor supply).  See Killingsworth, <I>Labor Supply</I>, pp.  119-125, Table 3.2 to 3.5.  Also see comparable variation in the demand elasticities for labor in Daniel S.  Hamermesh, <I>Labor Demand</I> (Princeton, N.  J.:  Princeton University Press, 1993), Table 7.5.  The elasticity of labor supply used in the Washington University Macro Model is 0.29 percent and lies within the midrange of the estimates contained in this literature.<P>

<li>See Technical Notes for a full description of how these figures were calculated.  It should be noted here, however, that the foregone savings is distributed to three different age groupings that each save for only one of the three purchases.  Allowing only one purchase for each group significantly simplified an otherwise complicated problem.  The group that is saving for education (those people under age 18) is not saving for a home purchase.  The group that is saving for a home purchase (aged 18 through 35) is not saving for retirement.  And the group saving for retirement (age 35 and above) is saving only for retirement.<p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The 1996 presidential campaign has rekindled the debate over tax reductions. Among the proposals being considered are an across-the-board reduction in tax rates, the repeal of rate increases imposed in 1990 and 1993, the deductibility of payroll taxes, and a modified flat tax. But regardless of the particular features of each change under consideration, the argument is the same. Proponents argue that lower tax rates will spur economic growth by reducing the penalty on working, saving, and investing. Opponents disagree, claiming that the economy is doing fine and that tax rate reductions, if enacted, will help the rich disproportionately while widening the deficit.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Fortunately, there is a way to judge the desirability of lower tax rates. The United States has had three major episodes of tax rate reductions -- the 1920s, 1960s, and 1980s. By looking at how the economy performed during these periods, and by examining what happened to the deficit and the degree to which different income classes were affected, it is possible to gain useful evidence about the desirability of tax rate reductions today.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The evidence provides strong support for those who believe the economy is weak and favor reductions in tax rates. Recent history is especially compelling. Tax rate increases in 1990 and 1993 boosted the top rate to 39.6 percent (and over 42 percent including the Medicare payroll tax). This means a 50 percent increase in the tax burden on work, saving, investment, and entrepreneurship when compared with the 28 percent rate in effect when Ronald Reagan left office. The effect has been dismal:
<p><ul>
<li> During the post-Reagan era, the economy has experienced its worst seven-year performance since the end of World War II.
<p>
<li> Real median family income, the best measure of living standards for the average American, has fallen by more than $2,000 since Reagan left office.
<p>
<li> Assuming there is no change in policy, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that economic growth for the next ten years will average less than 2.1 percent annually.<sup>1</sup>  This is well below the post-World War II average of 3.2 percent.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The economy's sub-standard performance in recent years should come as no surprise. As seen below, major changes in tax policy inevitably affect growth.
<p><ul>
<li>Across-the-board tax rate reductions in the 1920s reduced the top rate from 71 percent to 24 percent. The economy boomed, growing by 59 percent between 1921 and 1929.
<p>
<li> In 1930, Herbert Hoover raised tax rates from 25 percent to a maximum of 63 percent, and Franklin Roosevelt boosted them to 79 percent later in the decade. The 1930s, to put it mildly, are not remembered as one of the American economy's better decades.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
<li> Across-the-board tax rate reductions introduced by President John F. Kennedy reduced the top rate from 91 percent to 70 percent. These lower rates, along with substantially lower taxes on savings and investment, are associated with the longest economic expansion in American history.<sup>3</sup>
<p>
<li> The Johnson surtax, enacted in 1968 during the administration of President Lyndon Johnson, combined with the inflation-induced bracket creep of the 1970s (subjecting taxpayers to higher rates even though their real incomes had not changed), resulted in a decade of stagflation.
<p>
<li> Reagan's across-the-board tax cuts ushered in America's longest peacetime expansion, helping to create 20 million new jobs and pushing incomes and living standards to record highs.
<p>
<li> The tax rate increases imposed under George Bush and Bill Clinton, as outlined below, are associated with the slowest growing economy in 50 years and a decline of more than $2,000 in the average family's income.

If legislators want to unleash stronger growth and more prosperity, the best tax policy would be the flat tax. Under that proposal, all three major problems of the current tax code -- high rates, anti-capital bias, and complexity -- would be minimized. To the extent that politicians are reluctant to adopt a flat tax, however, any change that moved in the right direction would be helpful. If history is any guide, any tax rate reduction, whether a 15 percent across-the-board cut, a repeal of the Bush and Clinton tax hikes, or some other reform, would boost the economy and raise living standards.
<p>
<b>LOOKING AT CASE HISTORIES</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The effect of tax rates on economic activity should not be overstated. The economy, after all, can be affected significantly by trade policy, regulatory policy, monetary policy, and many other government actions. Even within the context of fiscal policy, tax rates are not the only critical issue. Both the level of government spending and where that money goes are very important. And even when looking only at tax policy, tax rates are just one piece of the puzzle. If certain types of income are subject to multiple layers of tax, as occurs in the current system, that problem cannot be solved by low rates. Similarly, a tax system with needless levels of complexity will impose heavy costs on the productive sector of the economy.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Keeping all these caveats in mind, there nonetheless is a distinct pattern throughout American history: Simply stated, when tax rates are reduced, the economy prospers, tax revenues grow, and lower-income citizens bear a lower share of the tax burden. Conversely, periods of higher tax rates are associated with subpar economic performance and stagnant tax revenues.
<P>
<b>The 1920s</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Under the leadership of Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon during the Administrations of Presidents Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge, tax rates were slashed from the confiscatory levels they had reached in World War I. The Revenue Acts of 1921, 1924, and 1926 reduced the top rate from 73 percent to 25 percent.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Spurred in part by lower tax rates, the economy expanded dramatically. In real terms, the economy grew 59 percent between 1921 and 1929, and annual economic growth averaged more than 6 percent.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Notwithstanding (or perhaps because of) the dramatic reduction in tax rates, personal income tax revenues increased substantially during the 1920s, rising from $719 million in 1921 to $1,160 million in 1928, an increase of more than 61 percent (this was a period of no inflation).<sup>4</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The share of the tax burden borne by the rich rose dramatically. As seen in <a href="bg1086c5.gif">Chart 5</a>, taxes paid by the rich (those making $50,000 and up in those days) climbed from 44.2 percent of the total tax burden in 1921 to 78.4 percent in 1928.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This surge in revenue was no surprise to Mellon:
<p><blockquote>
	The history of taxation shows that taxes which are inherently excessive are not paid. The high rates inevitably put pressure upon the taxpayer to withdraw his capital from productive business and invest it in tax-exempt securities or to find other lawful methods of avoiding the realization of taxable income. The result is that the sources of taxation are drying up; wealth is failing to carry its share of the tax burden; and capital is being diverted into channels which yield neither revenue to the Government nor profit to the people.<sup>5</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>The 1960s</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
President Kennedy proposed a series of tax rate reductions in 1963 that resulted in legislation the following year dropping the top rate from 91 percent in 1963 to 70 percent by 1965.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Kennedy tax cuts helped trigger the longest economic expansion in America's history. Between 1961 and 1968, the inflation-adjusted economy expanded by more than 42 percent. On a yearly basis, economic growth averaged more than 5 percent.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Tax revenues grew strongly, rising by 62 percent between 1961 and 1968. Adjusted for inflation, they rose by one-third.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Just as in the 1920s, the share of the income tax burden borne by the rich increased. Tax collections from those making over $50,000 per year climbed by 57 percent between 1963 and 1966, while tax collections from those earning below $50,000 rose 11 percent. As a result, the rich saw their portion of the income tax burden climb from 11.6 percent to 15.1 percent.<sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
According to President Kennedy:
<p><blockquote>
	Our true choice is not between tax reduction, on the one hand, and the avoidance of large Federal deficits on the other. It is increasingly clear that no matter what party is in power, so long as our national security needs keep rising, an economy hampered by restrictive tax rates will never produce enough revenues to balance our budget just as it will never produce enough jobs or enough profits. Surely the lesson of the last decade is that budget deficits are not caused by wild-eyed spenders but by slow economic growth and periodic recessions and any new recession would break all deficit records. In short, it is a paradoxical truth that tax rates are too high today and tax revenues are too low and the soundest way to raise the revenues in the long run is to cut the rates now.<sup>8</sup>

</blockquote>
<p>
<b>The 1980s</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
President Reagan presided over two major pieces of tax legislation which together reduced the top tax rate from 70 percent in 1980 to 28 percent by 1988.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The economic effects of the Reagan tax cuts were dramatic. When Reagan took office in 1981, the economy was being choked by high inflation and was in the middle of a double-dip recession (1980 and 1982). The tax cuts helped pull the economy out of the doldrums and ushered in the longest period of peacetime economic growth in America's history. During the seven-year Reagan boom, economic growth averaged almost 4 percent.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Critics charge that the tax cuts caused higher deficits, but they misread the evidence. The Reagan tax cut, though approved in 1981, was phased in over several years. As a result, bracket creep (indexing was not implemented until 1985) and payroll tax increases completely swamped Reagan's 1.25 percent tax cut in 1981 and effectively canceled out the portion of the tax cut which went into effect in 1982. The economy received an unambiguous tax cut only as of January 1983. Thereafter, personal income tax revenues climbed dramatically, increasing by more than 54 percent by 1989 (28 percent after adjusting for inflation).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Contrary to conventional wisdom, it was the "rich" who paid the additional taxes. The share of income taxes paid by the top 10 percent of earners jumped significantly, climbing from 48.0 percent in 1981 to 57.2 percent in 1988. The top 1 percent saw their share of the income tax bill climb even more dramatically, from 17.6 percent in 1981 to 27.5 percent in 1988.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One of the chief architects of the Reagan tax cuts was then-U.S. Representative <a href="/heritage/staff/kemp.htm">Jack Kemp</a> (R-NY). According to Kemp:
<p><blockquote>
	At some point, additional taxes so discourage the activity being taxed, such as working or investing, that they yield less revenue rather than more. There are, after all, two rates that yield the same amount of revenue: high tax rates on low production, or low rates on high production.<sup>10</sup>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>THE LESSONS
<p>
1) Lower tax rates do not mean less tax revenue.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The tax cuts of the 1920s:</b> Personal income tax revenues increased substantially during the 1920s, despite the reduction in rates. Revenues rose from $719 million in 1921 to $1164 million in 1928, an increase of more than 61 percent (this was a period of virtually no inflation).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>The Kennedy tax cuts:</b> Tax revenues climbed from $94 billion in 1961 to $153 billion in 1968, an increase of 62 percent (33 percent after adjusting for inflation).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>The Reagan tax cuts:</b> Total tax revenues climbed by 99.4 percent during the 1980s, and the results are even more impressive when looking at what happened to personal income tax revenues. Once the economy received an unambiguous tax cut in January 1983, income tax revenues climbed dramatically, increasing by more than 54 percent by 1989 (28 percent after adjusting for inflation).
<p>
<b>2) The rich pay more when incentives to hide income are reduced.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The tax cuts of the 1920s:</b> The share of the tax burden paid by the rich rose dramatically as tax rates were reduced. The share of the tax burden borne by the rich (those making $50,000 and up in those days) climbed from 44.2 percent in 1921 to 78.4 percent in 1928.<sup>11</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>The Kennedy tax cuts:</b> Just as happened in the 1920s, the share of the income tax burden borne by the rich increased following the tax cuts. Tax collections from those making over $50,000 per year climbed by 57 percent between 1963 and 1966, while tax collections from those earning below $50,000 rose 11 percent. As a result, the rich saw their portion of the income tax burden climb from 11.6 percent to 15.1 percent.<sup>12</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>The Reagan tax cuts:</b> The share of income taxes paid by the top 10 percent of earners jumped significantly, climbing from 48.0 percent in 1981 to 57.2 percent in 1988. The top 1 percent saw their share of the income tax bill climb even more dramatically, from 17.6 percent in 1981 to 27.5 percent in 1988.<sup>13</sup>

<p>

<b>THE 1990S: IGNORING THE LESSONS OF THE PAST</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Unlike reductions in tax rates, increases in tax rates have a history of failure. The Hoover and Roosevelt tax increases of the 1930s certainly contributed to the dismal economy during the Great Depression. Tax revenues fell during much of the period, and the deficit increased. And as <a href="bg1086c11.gif">Chart 11</a> shows, the high tax rates of the 1950s resulted in sluggish revenue growth. Ignoring history, both Democrats and Republicans at the time argued that tax rates reaching over 90 percent could not be cut for fear of revenue loss. Moreover, the 1970s, which began with the Johnson surtax and later were hit by bracket creep, triggered the tax revolt and the Reagan tax cuts.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Perhaps more than any other decade, however, the 1990s make the best argument against higher tax rates. In both 1990 and 1993, the economy was subjected to record tax increases, the ostensible purpose of which was to raise revenue to reduce the budget deficit. As <a href="bg1086c12.gif">Chart 12</a> illustrates, however, these increases backfired. Total tax revenue, as a percent of economic output, is expected to be lower this year than it was when Reagan left office.<sup>14</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Significantly, the modest decline in revenues relative to gross domestic product (GDP) is due to the slower growth in personal income tax revenues. As shown in <a href="bg1086c12.gif">Chart 12</a>, individual income tax revenues totaled 8.6 percent of economic output in 1989. By 1996 -- two large tax increases later -- individual income tax revenues had fallen to 8.5 percent of economic output. In other words, the tax that was increased the most accounts for the drop in tax revenue as a share of national output.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
High tax rates are bad for the economy. High tax rates that increase the deficit by reducing the growth of tax revenue are even worse. What makes recent history especially tragic is that the economic and budgetary losses could have been avoided if Bush and Clinton had simply kept Reagan's policies in place. In 1989, the Congressional Budget Office projected that the budget deficit, which then was $152 billion, would continue to fall for the next five years assuming no change in Reagan's policies. As of 1995 -- again, two large tax increases later -- the budget deficit had risen to $164 billion, and it is projected by the CBO to reach more than $400 billion by 2006 if Clinton's policies are left in place.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The dismal budget numbers, however, tell only part of the story. The economy has been the real victim of higher tax rates. As <a href="bg1086c13.gif">Chart 13</a> shows, the post-Reagan era has seen the slowest growth of any seven-year period since the end of World War II. As discussed earlier, this slow growth has left people with more than $2,000 less income when inflation is taken into account. The biggest losers have been the poor. As Chart 14 illustrates, income for the bottom 20 percent has fallen the most during the Bush/Clinton era. The politicians who imposed the higher taxes, needless to say, argued that the rich would be the ones to suffer.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The economy is limping, incomes have been falling, tax revenues are stagnant, and it is projected that the deficit will more than double in the next ten years. This is the legacy of higher tax rates and a tax code that punishes working, saving, and investing. History shows clearly that the way to reverse this trend is to cut tax rates. Legislation to reduce rates would do this. Better still, Congress should scrap the current system as quickly as possible and replace it with a flat tax that treats all taxpayers equally and minimizes the burden on productive behavior.

<a href="fyi102t3.gif">Table 3</a>: Direct and Indirect Costs Can Consume Half the Cost of Employing a Worker 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Average American workers have become frustrated that their take-home pay seems to buy less and less. Some policymakers say this is because corporations are not passing on to workers the real value of their labor. Focusing on the low-paid, some lawmakers say take-home pay needs to be increased by raising the minimum wage, even though this would destroy thousands of job opportunities.<sup>1</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The problem with this view is that it overlooks the huge gap between what employers pay out to hire and maintain a worker and the amount of money that actually reaches the worker in the form of a paycheck that can be cashed. Most American workers have little understanding of just how much disappears from their earnings before the money reaches their pockets. They usually are aware only of the taxes taken directly from their paychecks. What they do not see is the additional cost of government taxes, mandates, and regulations that employers also must bear and that, in practice, comes out of a worker's compensation.<sup>2</sup>  Over the past 20 years, these additional costs have taken an ever-increasing bite out of personal income, creating a larger and larger "wedge" between the cost of hiring a worker and what that worker receives as take-home pay.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

How do government taxes, mandates, and regulations increase the cost of hiring employees and reduce the take-home pay of workers?
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In 1995, it cost all employers in private industry an average of $17.10 per hour to hire and keep workers on their payrolls.<sup>3</sup>  After the cost of government-mandated benefits, taxes, and optional benefits is deducted, workers took home an average of $9.84 per hour, 42 percent less than the total direct expense of employing them. The total tax wedge (government-mandated benefit costs plus taxes) cost workers an average of $4.00 per hour, or 23 percent of their total compensation.<sup>4</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In 1995, it cost a typical employer at least $4.76 per hour to hire a minimum wage worker.<sup>5</sup>  After the cost of government-mandated benefits and taxes ($1.03) is deducted and the Earned Income Tax Credit is added, however, an average minimum wage worker took home only $3.73 per hour, or 22 percent less than the total expense of employing that worker and 12 percent less than the cash wage of $4.25.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

These figures do not include the hidden cost of federal regulations. One study estimates the regulatory burden per employee, on average, to be in the range of $3,000 to $4,000. This equals somewhere from $1.40 to $2.00 per hour for a full-time worker.<sup>6</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Government must share the blame for reductions in the take-home pay of American workers. Over the years, it has forced employers to shift more of their employees' "pay" to mandated employee benefits, thereby making the hiring of workers more and more expensive. Employers, as well as employees, operate within a competitive labor market in which wage rates broadly reflect the productivity of workers -- <I>less</I> the costs of taxes, mandated benefits, and regulations associated with employing a worker. The more productive a worker is, the more that worker will be paid. The smaller the government tax and mandate wedge is, the more cash workers will be able to take home.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The solution to this problem is not more government mandates, such as job-killing increases in the minimum wage. Instead, government should pursue policies that directly reduce the wedge between compensation and take-home pay. Such policies also would promote economic growth and thereby increase productivity, job opportunities, and real earnings. Specifically, Congress should cut payroll and income taxes, reduce the regulatory burden on business, cut the capital gains tax, and improve basic education through school choice.
<p>
<b>THE DIRECT COST OF GOVERNMENT TAXES AND MANDATED BENEFITS</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The hourly wage that employers pay is not what workers take home; nor is it the total cost of labor borne by businesses. When calculating the hourly cash wage rate that a business will pay workers, the employer also must take into account the legal obligation to pay Social Security/Medicare taxes, federal and state unemployment insurance taxes, and workers' compensation taxes.<sup>7</sup>  These costs reduce the amount the employer otherwise would be prepared to pay, based on the productivity of the worker. But from the wages and salaries employees receive initially in their paychecks, workers must pay their share of Social Security/Medicare taxes, as well as federal and state income taxes. The difference between this cost of labor to employers (cash wages plus mandated taxes and benefits) and the take-home pay of workers (cash wages minus payroll and income taxes), is the tax wedge (see <a href="fyi102c1.gif">Chart 1</a>). In 1995, the tax wedge averaged $4.00 per hour, or 23 percent of an average worker's total hourly compensation (see <a href="fyi102t1.gif">Table 1</a>).<sup>8</sup> 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Legally mandated benefits, such as unemployment insurance and workers' compensation, are not "free" to the worker, as many employees assume. A range of studies indicates that, on average, some 88 percent of the cost of all employer-paid government-mandated benefit taxes is shifted to workers in the form of reduced cash compensation.<sup>9</sup>

<li><b>In 1995, it cost a typical employer at least $4.76 per hour to hire a minimum wage worker.</b><sup>16</sup>  After the cost of government-mandated benefits and taxes ($1.03) is deducted, however, an average minimum wage worker took home only $3.73 per hour, or 22 percent less than the total expense of employing that worker and 12 percent less than the cash wage of $4.25.
</ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Over the years, proliferating mandates and rising taxes have increased the cost of hiring workers. By 1994, the cost of government-mandated benefits accounted for 8.9 percent of total employer payrolls, up from 6.3 percent in 1971 and just 3.5 percent in 1951.<sup>17</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Government taxes and fees have been taking an ever-increasing bite out of personal income (<a href="fyi102c2.gif">Chart 2</a>). Although real personal income per person increased 121 percent from 1959 to 1995, government taxes and fees paid per person increased 155 percent in real terms over the same period.<sup>18</sup>  In 1994, federal, state, and local governments took an average of $2,800 (in 1992 dollars) from every person.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition, in recent years there has been a significant increase in mandated benefits (<a href="fyi102t2.gif">Table 2</a>), and these costs are likely to become larger in the future. For example:
<ul>
<li>If Congress proceeds with a proposed 90 cent increase in the minimum wage, it will cost consumers and workers about $2.2 billion per year as the cost of entry-level jobs is passed on through higher prices and lower real wages. It also will cause employers to create over 200,000 fewer entry-level jobs each year until 1999.<sup>19</sup>
<P>
<li>The Medicare program is on the brink of insolvency. To put it on a sound financial basis without reforming and improving the way the program operates could mean as much as a 3.52 percentage point increase on top of the current 2.9 percent Medicare payroll tax. This means workers earning $45,000 per year would have to pay an additional payroll tax of $1,584 per year.
</ul>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If Americans had to write a monthly check for each tax and government-mandated benefit, they would quickly understand how government excess, rather than corporate greed, consumes their take-home pay.
<p>
<b>THE HIDDEN COSTS OF GOVERNMENT REGULATION</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Taxes and mandated benefits are not the only government policies that drive a wedge between the cost of hiring an employee and that employee's take-home pay. Regulations also increase the cost of employing workers. For example, environmental and workplace safety regulations impose costs that take the form of such things as compliance expenditures (e.g., equipment purchases, worker training); time lost due to paperwork requirements; delays in the processing and issuance of permits required by the government; and attorneys fees incurred in regulation-related litigation. For the smallest businesses, the costs of tax compliance (paying professionals to decipher the tax code, filling out forms, maintaining the appropriate records) and payroll recordkeeping are the largest components of the regulatory burden.<sup>20</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Regulation imposes the heaviest burden on small and medium-sized businesses because they find it harder to spread the high overhead costs of paperwork, attorney and accountant fees, and staff time needed to negotiate the federal regulatory maze. According to recent studies by Professor Thomas Hopkins of the Rochester Institute of Technology:
<p><ul>
<li>For the average firm with fewer than 20 employees, the regulatory cost per employee is estimated to be about $5,500. For the largest firms (those with more than 500 employees), the cost is about $3,000 per employee.<sup>21</sup>  Unfortunately, Congress has responded to the disproportionate burden on small business by exempting different sizes of companies from different regulatory statutes. The effect of this approach has been to discourage companies near an established threshold from hiring new employees.<sup>22</sup>
<P>
<li>The business regulatory burden also varies considerably by industry. For example, the average cost of regulation per employee in the manufacturing industry, where regulatory costs are the highest, is in the range of $5,000 to $7,000. For the service industry, where regulatory costs are the lowest, it is in the range of $2,000 to $3,000. As <a href="fyi102t3.gif">Table 3</a> shows, these average costs are equal to a range of approximately $1.00 to $3.00 per hour per worker.<sup>23</sup>
</ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

As Professor Hopkins notes, estimating the precise cost of federal regulations to business and workers is extremely difficult. These cost estimates are intended to offer only an illustrative profile of the cost of the regulatory system. While these estimates do not factor in the benefits of particular regulations, understanding the cost impact is important for policymakers, particularly in light of the already significant costs to employers of taxes and mandated benefits.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Although regulation imposes costs on businesses, ultimately they are passed on to individual Americans, often through lower wages (see <a href="fyi102c3.gif">Chart 3</a>).<sup>24</sup>  Moreover, mandated requirements, such as family and medical leave, directly affect an employer's decisions about whether and when to hire a worker, which worker to hire, how much cash to pay the worker, and how long to keep that worker. The rise in mandated labor costs paid by employers is one of the most important forces leading companies to lay off workers, as well as to utilize part-time, temporary, and contract labor.<sup>25</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A recent study by Richard Vedder for the Center for the Study of American Business shows that in addition to the costs of complying with regulation, there are longer-run costs in the form of reduced productivity. Vedder explains that when a business must devote resources to implementing regulatory mandates, those resources are used in a less efficient manner because firms are forced to use more costly and less productive methods of production.<sup>26</sup>  This significant "drag" on productivity denies workers higher wages and a higher standard of living.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Other studies support similar conclusions. One 1987 study by economist Wayne Gray examined the effects of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulations on 450 manufacturing industries and concluded that these regulations explained more than 30 percent of the slowdown in productivity from the 1960s to the 1973-1978 period.<sup>27</sup>  A 1995 study by the Employment Policy Foundation found that 19 percent of the productivity slowdown during the 1970s is directly attributable to regulations published by OSHA28 and that nearly half of the slowdown in long-run productivity growth can be explained by rising government regulatory activity.<sup>29</sup>Further, since productivity and workers' pay and benefits rise together, government regulations are directly responsible for some part of the slowdown in wage growth and take-home pay (<a href="fyi102c3.gif">Chart 3</a>).
<p>
<b>RAISING TAKE-HOME PAY</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress and the Administration should focus on policies that will increase wages and job opportunities for Americans by improving labor productivity and reducing the cost of employing workers. Specifically, Congress and the Administration should:
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<b>Cut payroll taxes.</b> Taxes and government-mandated benefits cost the average worker over 21 percent of total compensation -- 13.8 percent for minimum wage workers. The solution is not more mandates -- for example, a higher minimum wage. Cutting payroll taxes, however, would directly increase take-home pay.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Cut the capital gains tax.</b> The U.S. tax code punishes capital investment by taxing investment income more than once.<sup>30</sup>  It taxes corporate and individual income from investment, and then taxes capital a third time by taxing capital gains. Lowering the capital gains tax would increase investment in the U.S. and provide an incentive for both American and foreign firms to put their capital to work here with American workers. A capital gains tax cut also would make more venture capital available for emerging technologies and for research and development that would improve future productivity.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Enact significant regulatory reform.</b> The explosion of new regulations since 1988 has raised the cost of labor and capital, created barriers to the formation of new companies and jobs, and raised the cost of employing Americans. This higher cost of employment in turn means that in a competitive economy, the return to labor in the form of wages is reduced. The regulatory burden needs to be rolled back, not only to allow wages to rise, but also to decrease the cost of hiring workers. To do this, Congress should strengthen White House oversight of executive branch agencies; establish in statute a set of principles, including cost-benefit analysis, to guide regulatory decisionmaking; establish a regulatory budget; and require federal agencies to review existing regulations to ensure that they meet sound regulatory principles.<sup>31</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Increase the skills of the workforce.</b> What is needed is fundamental change aimed at improving basic education through school choice, strengthening core curricula, and enabling local educators to improve discipline and set high expectations. Congress also should consider tax-deferred or tax-free education savings accounts similar to individual retirement accounts, or enabling states and individuals to use lump-sum unemployment insurance benefits for education and training.

<P>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Politicians who blame "corporate greed" for what is happening to the take-home pay of American workers are diverting attention from the real problem: an overly intrusive and expensive federal government. Over the years, more and more mandates, higher and higher taxes, and excessive regulation have slowed the growth of the economy and created a larger and larger wedge between the cost of hiring employees and workers' take-home pay. If Americans had to write a monthly check for each tax and government-mandated benefit, they would quickly realize the significant costs government imposes and the effects on their take-home pay.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The solution to these problems is not more government mandates and programs, such as job-killing increases in the minimum wage. Instead, what is needed are policies that focus on the primary problems -- high payroll and income taxes, and excessive regulation. Removing these obstacles will increase productivity, job opportunities, and real wage growth for all Americans.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
According to recent polls in Russia, Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov ranks first among the Russian presidential candidates. President Boris Yeltsin, ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, social democrat Grigory Yavlinski, retired general Alexander Lebed, former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, and six other candidates are also competing for Russia's top job. On June 16, Zyuganov has a good chance of receiving a plurality of the vote -- roughly 30 percent. This percentage could allow him to participate in a runoff election four weeks later against the other highest vote-getter (most likely President Yeltsin).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov's constituency consists largely of those who have lost out during Russia's progress toward a free-market economy and democracy. These people -- primarily the elderly, the unemployed, and unskilled workers who lack higher education -- are motivated not so much by communist ideology as by the hardships of day-to-day living and disappointment in the reform process. It is difficult to convince them that the communist pledges of a welfare state cannot be implemented, and that the social safety net promised by Zyuganov will require funds that are not available. The only way to raise these funds would be through a major increase in the money supply, which also would lead to hyper-inflation and even more economic hardship.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov claims to be the leader of a broad "national-patriotic" coalition and is supported by non-communist nationalist figures, such as influential Duma deputies Sergei Baburin and Alexei Podberezkin. One of the chief ideologists of Russian imperialism and militarism, Alexander Prokhanov, is among his staunchest allies.<sup>1</sup>  His political platform is a bizarre mixture of populist, communist, and Russian nationalist rhetoric that clearly implies a "communist revenge" -- turning the clock back to government ownership of Russia's industrial assets, aggressive regulation of the economy by the central government, fixed prices and wages, rationing and shortages of consumer goods, the stifling of basic freedoms, and strict control over the mass media, in addition to a new military buildup and renewed confrontation with the West. It is highly doubtful that such objectives can be achieved peacefully.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If Zyuganov wins the presidential election, the potential for violence, both internally (as the communists move to crush the opposition) and externally (as Russia takes a more aggressive stance toward its neighbors and the West), will increase. The resulting destabilization could have dramatic ramifications both for Russian and U.S. vital interests. As president of Russia, Zyuganov not only would lead his country down the road of more confrontation with the U.S. and the West, but might even exaggerate his differences with the West to mobilize popular support and resentment at home.

<p>
<b>WHO ARE YOU, DR. ZYUGANOV?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
On June 26, 1996, Zyuganov will be 52 years old. He was born in the village of Mymrino in the Central Russian region of Oryol, about 200 miles southwest of Moscow. The son of rural school teachers, he enjoyed higher social status, better living standards, and a richer intellectual environment than the other village children; but the post-collectivization and post-World War II hardships also affected his childhood. He graduated with honors from high school at age 17 and immediately began teaching. Zyuganov wed one of his pupils and now has two married children.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1962, Zyuganov became a student at the physics and mathematics department of the local teachers college in Oryol. Less than a year later, while still a freshman, he was drafted into the army. Zyuganov served two years in a special nuclear and chemical reconnaissance unit of the Soviet troops stationed in East Germany and was sent to perform decontamination work in the South Urals after a major nuclear catastrophe in the late 1950s (a disaster hushed up by the Soviet authorities for decades). He apparently was exposed to nuclear radiation while serving in this unit.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov proceeded along the typical Soviet <I>nomenklatura</I> career path. At the age of 21, while still serving in the army, he joined the Communist Party (CPSU). The fact that he was drafted into the party at such a young age indicates that he was very disciplined, politically astute and loyal, on good terms with his superiors, and sufficiently pragmatic to anticipate the benefits of early Communist Party affiliation. After resuming his studies at the college, he became a Young Communist League (Komsomol) activist and quickly went on to become a full-time functionary heading the Oryol city and regional committee. In 1974, he became a regional Communist Party deputy chief, responsible for day-to-day running of the region and for ideological questions.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1978, he began postgraduate work at the prestigious Academy of Social Sciences under the Communist Party Central Committee, then the center of political training for top Communist Party <I>apparatchiks</I>. Recommendations from powerful superiors were needed to enter. He earned a Candidate (Ph.D.) at the Academy and 14 years later became a Doctor of Science in Philosophy.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Completing the postgraduate course at the Academy of Social Sciences boosted his party career and allowed him to network with powerful Central Committee staff members. Soon Zyuganov was transferred to Moscow to become a bureaucrat in the CPSU Central Committee's omnipotent Propaganda Department (later renamed the Ideological Department). The Propaganda Department monitored and shaped the nation's communist indoctrination and exercised strict ideological control over all aspects of life in the USSR. In 1990, toward the end of his party career, Zyuganov was promoted to the position of deputy head of the Propaganda Department, but the fall of the Soviet Union prevented him from becoming one of the top decision makers. Moreover, the department lost influence during the perestroika years under Mikhail Gorbachev. These were not easy times for Gennady Zyuganov. He had to maneuver between his direct superior, Secretary for Ideology of the Central Committee Alexander N. Yakovlev -- the liberal "architect of perestroika" -- and hard-line Politburo Secretary Yegor K. Ligachev, who opposed Gorbachev's policies of glasnost.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov made his final choice in favor of the hard-line communists in 1990 when he joined the newly established Communist Party of the Russian Federation, which brought together all of Gorbachev's militant opponents. Zyuganov was immediately elected to the new party governing bodies and became one of the chief ideologists of the anti-democratic and anti-reform forces in Russia, working to consolidate them under his own leadership within the "national patriotic movement," a motley coalition of anti-Western, anti-reform, and anti-Semitic organizations.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov co-authored the infamous "Word to the People" appeal, a declaration which called for reversing reforms, preserving the Soviet Union, and putting down the independence movements in the republics. Published in July of 1991 in the hard-line media  -- for example, in such newspapers as <I>Pravda, Segodnya</I>, and <I>Sovetskaya Rossiya</I> -- this declaration became an ideological basis for the August 1991 abortive coup, which was an attempt to restore totalitarianism in Russia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What Zyuganov wrote in words, he did not implement in practice, being personally either cautious or cowardly. His behavior during and after the 1991 coup significantly tainted his political image among the communists. Despite his authorship of the "Word to the People," he neither actively supported the attempt nor opposed the subsequent banning of communist parties. In fact, the ban scared Zyuganov so much that he chose to lie low for a time.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The unemployed Zyuganov found asylum with the "Russian-American University" (RAU-Corporation),<sup>2</sup>  a center which became a rallying point for "national-patriotic" forces favoring a return to Russia's lost superpower status and "special way of development."  The U.S. Department of State denounced the RAU, calling it a CPSU and KGB front organization, and recommended that American government and private agencies refrain from contacts with it.<sup>3</sup>  Zyuganov plunged into the study of nationalist rhetoric. Alexander Barkashov, leader of the neo-fascist "Russian National Unity" party, once admitted that he had guided Zyuganov in mastering such concepts as the "Russian Idea" and "the Revival of the National Identity."<sup>4</sup>  These are shorthand for Russia's special national mission, geopolitical domination, and supposed racial superiority.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The fact that no anti-communist purge took place after the 1991 coup attempt encouraged Zyuganov to resume his political activities. In 1992, he chaired such left-wing and ultranationalist organizations as the Council of Popular Patriotic Forces, the Duma of the Russian National Council, and the National Salvation Council, which vehemently opposed President Yeltsin's reform policies and called for his impeachment. He and his associates also filed a complaint in the Constitutional Court questioning the legitimacy of the presidential decree which had banned the Communist Party. Zyuganov and his comrades won, and the Russian Communist Party's legal status was restored in 1993. Now successful, he was elected Chairman of the Party's Central Executive Committee in February 1993.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In 1993, Zyuganov helped exacerbate the confrontation between Yeltsin and the "red-brown" opposition which had concentrated in the Russian Supreme Soviet, the old Russian parliament held over from the days of the Soviet Union. The conflict reached a tragic climax in October 1993 with fierce clashes between pro-government forces and opposing rebel fighters in Moscow's streets as the seat of the Russian parliament (the White House) was shelled and stormed by the army. However, Zyuganov avoided direct participation in this mutiny as well, and even condemned the appeal made by its leaders for a general strike. By standing aloof, Zyuganov managed to avoid trouble and run for the State Duma (new parliament) in the December 12, 1993, elections. Other militant opposition leaders had been banned from these elections. Curiously, Zyuganov ran while decrying the illegitimacy of the new Duma, condemning what he called the "presidential coup" which had dissolved the Supreme Soviet.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Architect of the Communist Comeback.</b> The December 1993 election to the first State Duma of Russia put Zyuganov in the leadership position within the Duma's third-largest faction, after reformist Yegor Gaidar's "Russia's Choice" and Vladimir Zhirinovsky's ultranationalist Liberal Democrats. For the next three years, as he continued his unequivocal and belligerent criticism of the government, his popularity continued to rise. On December 17, 1995, in the second Duma elections, Zyuganov's Communist Party received 22 percent of the votes in the Duma. He was now the leader of its largest faction.
<P>
<b>THE WORLD ACCORDING TO COMRADE ZYUGANOV</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov's newly emerged philosophy has little to do with traditional Marxist-Leninist communism. Rather, it is a concoction of statist, nationalist, messianic, populist, and even religious Russian Orthodox slogans based on a profound mistrust of the West. Believing that the Western way of development can lead only to a historical dead end, Zyuganov proposes "a breakthrough to a new socio-economic system built on the great Russian cultural and historical heritage."<sup>5</sup>  However, he never specifies exactly what the elements of such a system would be and seems to ignore the fact that all attempts to achieve such a "breakthrough" under the Bolsheviks failed, generating disasters that exhausted Russia and resulted in the worse crisis the country had experienced since 1917.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov has no firsthand knowledge of the West and speaks no foreign languages, but his background, upbringing, and adult experiences have prejudiced him against what he calls "Western capitalism."  He is susceptible to anti-Western conspiracy theories that circulate regularly among Russian communists and nationalists. These speculations lay the blame for all Russia's current hardships at the feet of "American imperialism" and its mysterious "agents of influence" in Russia, as well as Jews and Freemasons. Zyuganov claimed in 1995, for example, that the Soviet Union was dismembered as the result of a U.S. National Security Council directive adopted by John F. Kennedy after the Cuban Missile Crisis. He also believes that the purportedly secret "memoranda #1, 2, 3" drafted for George Bush were part of this strategy to undo the Soviet Union. He says that he obtained this information from a classified CPSU Central Committee "Special File" (<I>Osobaya Papka</I>) containing top secret documents allegedly obtained through intelligence channels.<sup>6</sup>  However, Zyuganov's relatively low position in the CPSU Ideological Department would not have given him access to top secret documents intended only for Politburo members.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Over the past few years, Zyuganov's aides and speechwriters have tried to blunt his anti-Western image. He often has tried to incorporate Western examples or ideas to buttress his essentially anti-Western points of view. For example, Zyuganov argued in 1994 that "Some pro-American people in this country demand that we should move towards private ownership and a limited government. But the U.S. itself rejects such an approach. Back in 1933 Franklin D. Roosevelt summoned 200 leading American industrialists and told them: ' You should share 50 percent of your income with the government or we will have an October Revolution on our hands in no time.'"<sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov's political campaign is based on inflaming political passions created by difficulties with the reform process. He is an alarmist who repeatedly predicts "disaster," "collapse," the "disintegration" of Russia, the extinction of the population, the humiliation of the nation, and total impoverishment.8  In his anti-Yeltsin rhetoric, he persistently condemns the government as "anti-people," carefully avoiding the fact that most of Russia's present difficulties emerged long before the reforms were started, under the communist regime of Mikhail Gorbachev. His favorite theme is that Russia is dying out, losing one million souls annually. He shuns statistics testifying to the contrary -- for example, that the mortality rate in 1995 dropped dramatically, while the birth rate grew for the first time since the 1970s.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>No Repentance.</b> Russian Communists like Zyuganov have never acknowledged or repented of the massive crimes committed against the nation by their predecessors. On the contrary, Zyuganov praises Vladimir Lenin, who personally ordered the shooting of thousands of innocent citizens, as "the most outstanding leader who unerringly felt Russia's deepest sorrows and needs."<sup>10</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov does not praise Stalin outright, but he also allows no official communist criticism of him.11  He claims that there was no Soviet repression in the post-World War II period<sup>12</sup> and that there are more victims of repression in prisons today than under Stalin.<sup>13</sup>  Zyuganov once told the German magazine <I>Der Spiegel</I> that only two persons were arrested in his native village in the post-World War II period, and that both were hardened criminals. In fact, however, many in this village perished during Stalin's purges.<sup>14</sup>  Zyuganov even denies that former Soviet leaders like Leonid Brezhnev and Yuri Andropov ever sent political dissidents to the Gulag and special psychiatric prisons.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Zyuganov's Electoral Platform.</b> Zyuganov's electorate is stable and will vote for him under any circumstances. Thus, his main objective is to draw in those who are still undecided. Thus far, he has failed to produce a comprehensive program that encompasses all the views of the "broad national patriotic coalition," but his electoral platform, published in March 1996, undoubtedly is not as clear-cut as the secret Program Maximum (set of ultimate political goals) designed for internal communist consumption. While publicly Zyuganov makes no mention of nationalizing privatized property, the party program calls for "nationalization or confiscation of the property acquired against the law, national interests and the rights of working people."<sup>15</sup>  Presumably, the Communist Party will assume the prerogative of determining exactly what those interests and rights are. The newly published communist economic plan, unveiled in Moscow on May 28, calls for reversal of privatization which was executed "through violation of law" and allows meager private ownership limited to apartments, small garden plots, and small service businesses. The program, if implemented, would reverse the achievements of four years of economic reform and severely injure both Russian and Western private-sector interests.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Indeed, Zyuganov does not offer Russia any sort of positive future. What he does pledge is a return to the communist past: economic regulation by the government, state monopoly of foreign trade, state ownership of land with no right to sell or buy property, government subsidies for bankrupt and uncompetitive industries, and restoration of the former Soviet Union.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov accuses the present government of destroying people's savings by devaluing the currency. To remedy this problem, he has promised to reimburse people for their losses. However, he overlooks the fact that most of the devaluation and confiscation of the currency occurred under the communist governments of former Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov and Prime Minister Valentin Pavlov in 1990-1991, before the reforms were launched. Nor do Zyuganov and the authors of his economic plan explain where they will get the money to restore the people's savings.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov's platform lacks clear and specific legislative proposals and policy guidelines. Instead, it contains numerous clichs: for example, "power should be returned to the people"; "children should get everything they are deprived of"; "women will rear children with confidence in their future"; and "talented people should be backed by the government."<sup>16</sup>  The communist election platform conceals rather than elucidates the policies Zyuganov would pursue if elected. Many in Moscow believe that Zyuganov himself does not know.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But some of his comrades believe they know. A group of communist Duma members in the spring of 1996 drafted a law "On Emergency Measures to Extricate Russia from the Crisis and to Ensure Its Socio-Economic Development."  This is blatant anti-reform manifesto envisages:
<p><ul>
<li><b> Restoration</b> of the government central planning system under a reestablished committee (GosPlan);<p>

<li><b>  Review</b> all legislation on privatization (with a view to stopping or reversing all privatization);<p>

<li><b>  Restoration</b> of government ministries to manage industries;
<p>
<li><b>  Regulation</b> of wholesale and retail prices;<p>
<li><b>  High protectionist</b> tariffs on imports;<P>
<li><b>  Increased</b> taxation;
<p>
<li><b>  Modernization</b> of Russia's defense industries and increased manufacture of armaments;<P>
<li><b>  Massive government subsidies</b> for the agricultural sector; and
<p>
<li><b>  Censorship</b> of the mass media.<sup>17</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The new communist economic plan issued for public consumption before the elections is a watered-down version of this legislation. Deeply rooted in anti-Western and anti-market ideology, the plan promises retreat from market reforms, the imposition of protectionism, and greatly increased government spending for industrial and agricultural subsidies and a social safety net.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Another communist idea is the restoration of the USSR, which under present circumstances would mean an attempt to rebuild a Russian empire hostile to its neighbors, both near and far. On March 15, 1996, communists in the Duma denounced the 1991 Belovezh agreement on the dismantling of the USSR. This move has caused great concern on the part of Russia's neighbors and other Western countries.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Appearing to Conciliate the West.</b> Zyuganov realizes that if he becomes president, he will still be dependent on Western loans and investments to keep the Russian economy afloat. Thus, particularly when addressing a Western audience, he does his utmost to mask his real intentions. He and his deputies currently are campaigning to convince Western politicians and the Western public that communists are harmless and that their ascension to power would strengthen democracy in Russia and improve the climate for foreign investment. This was the central theme of Zyuganov's message at the February 1996 Davos World Economic Forum in Switzerland,<sup>18</sup> at which he claimed that communists accept all forms of ownership of property and are simply trying to find the appropriate combination of private and state property for Russia. However, when U.S. Senator Bill Bradley (D-NJ) asked what he proposed to do to protect private property, Zyuganov avoided a direct answer.<sup>19</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Zyuganov's messages to the West contrast sharply with his statements designed for domestic consumption. His party's internal program clearly stands for ultimate control of all property by the government. However, he does not make this point when talking to foreigners. During a recent meeting with International Monetary Fund leaders, Zyuganov neglected to mention his interview last year in the Russian nationalist paper Zavtra (Tomorrow), in which he likened the IMF emissaries to Nazi regional leaders (Gauleiters) in Russia during World War II.<sup>20</sup>  Anatoly Chubais, Russia's former First Deputy Premier and architect of Yeltsin's privatization program, while speaking at the Davos forum in February warned that if the West flirted with Zyuganov, it would be responsible for the bloodshed that could well occur if the communists moved to renationalize private property. The only way communists can implement their true plans is through violence, said Chubais; they will never confine themselves solely to declarations.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Any comparison of Zyuganov to Central and East European leftist leaders is misleading. The former communists in Hungary and Poland show clear signs of having adjusted to the noncommunist political and economic system. The Russian communists do not.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Intraparty Challenges.</b> Unlike Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the authoritarian leader of the ultra-nationalist Liberal-Democratic Party, Gennady Zyuganov is being challenged for the leadership both of his own party and of its Duma faction. His main rival is Communist Party Chief of Staff Valentin Kuptsov, who was a contender for the chairmanship in 1993. Kuptsov, who is sophisticated and exercises strict control over the party staff, reportedly is supported by two-thirds of the party's members and by more than half of its Duma faction. Kuptsov is even more hard-line than Zyuganov and could be an even tougher adversary for Russian reformers and for the West if he ever seized power.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Gennady Seleznyov, former chief editor of <I>Pravda</I> and Communist speaker of the State Duma, also has increased his influence significantly within the party. Even if Zyuganov should win the presidency, a possible shift of power to the parliament could leave him scrambling for support among Duma and party members controlled by Kuptsov and Seleznyov.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Many of Zyuganov's allies in the Duma are more ideologically moderate and better integrated into the present Russian establishment than the rest of the party. In fact, many of Zyuganov's supporters are not dyed-in-the-wool communists, but bureaucrats who feel deprived of the opportunities for quick enrichment which privatization and corruption have brought so many other bureaucrats in Yeltsin's administration.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the long run, Russian policy under Zyuganov could be expected to recreate a major threat to America's interests and those of its European allies. Zyuganov's promise (made in December 1995 after the Duma elections) to invade Estonia if NATO is expanded to the Baltics, his declarations that only a reconstituted Soviet Union is capable of confronting the United States, and his deeply rooted hostility to the West all would tend to make his government assume an almost viscerally confrontational posture toward the Euro-Atlantic community should he become president of Russia.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

There are policymakers around Zyuganov who advocate Russia's aggressive involvement in the Middle East, including supporting arms sales to existing and future radical and fundamentalist regimes in the region. The fate of the world's largest oil reserves would be at stake if Moscow again attempted to destabilize the Middle East.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

If they put their campaign rhetoric into practice, Zyuganov and his team would move to reverse the outcome of the Cold War by attempting to build an anti-American coalition with Iran and China. Such a development undoubtedly would trigger a massive military buildup, both in the East and in the West, as arms control agreements with Russia unraveled.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Paradoxically, if Zyuganov came to power, the effect probably would be to accelerate NATO expansion to the East, as the West would interpret his election as an increased threat from Russia. The likely communist response to NATO expansion is predictable: confrontation with the West, intimidation of neighboring countries, and threats of a nuclear and conventional military buildup.

<h2>People Are Tired Of The Media Elite</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<DD>The Media Research Center engaged the Harris poll to do a survey of the 
news media and, in the words of Robert Lichter, the Center's Director, 
"people are tired of the media elite."
<DD>
It is about time. Media has been out of control in this nation for a 
long while, especially with the shift to advocacy journalism which 
occurred in the late 1960's and early 1970's accelerated by Watergate.
Now two thirds of the public, according to Harris, want just the facts 
rather than the journalists' judgment calls in stories involving public 
figures.
<DD>
The top complaints the public has against journalists are the 
following: Journalists ignore people's privacy. Ask Richard Jewell if 
he agrees with that one. Journalists are politically biased. The funny 
thing is that everyone from Jesse Jackson to Jesse Helms would agree 
with that complaint. Journalists are too influenced by the powerful. 
The real problem here isn't that journalists are paid off. The problem 
is that the powerful have access to important information and they 
become the sources for the journalists. You don't bite the hand that 
feeds you. Journalists provide one sided coverage. Take a look at any 
story, on television or in a major metropolitan daily. You will find 
that the opposing viewpoint to the thesis of the story will either be 
at the very end of the story, mentioned only briefly, or it will be 
entirely missing.
<DD>
Journalists are too negative. The prevailing attitude 
in newsrooms these days is that America is among the worst places on 
earth and that we are responsible for most of the world's problems. If 
you have that view, it is not hard to be negative. Journalists have too 
much influence. I can personally report on hundreds of meetings I have 
attended with political figures over the past 30 years, the outcome of 
which was driven by fears of the media and not by what was best for the 
nation. Journalists abuse freedom of the press. Nothing is sacred 
anymore to some journalists. If you know it, air it is their slogan, 
regardless of who is hurt.
<DD>
Journalists don't care about people. We live 
in a cynical age, but you can take that cynicism to the l0th power by 
surveying any newsroom. The media makes people guilty until proven 
innocent and when they are proven innocent they drop the story. The 
media portrays too much violence. The media believes that the public 
has an insatiable appetite for the gory details on everything and 
judging by the ratings of various TV shows, the media may be right on 
that score. The media is often inaccurate. Concern for accuracy went 
out the window with The New York Times v. Sullivan case. In that case, 
since expanded by the U.S. Supreme Court, the ruling was that anyone 
suing the media over misstatements had to prove malice in order to 
collect. That is well understood by the lowest journalist on the 
ladder.
<DD>
The media is too sensational. Again, the public needs to look 
to itself on this question. Unfortunately it is the sensational 
coverage of things which gets the ratings and sells the papers. 
Journalists ignore their errors. They do indeed. Retractions happen all 
too seldom on television and in the papers, retractions are generally 
on page 2, the least read of all of the pages of the newspaper.
I agree with most of the findings of this survey, but one issue greatly 
disturbs me. An astounding 84% of the public says that the government 
could require balanced reporting of controversial issues to the point 
of imposing a fine for inaccurate or biased reporting. Hold on just a 
minute here. The same people, a majority of whom in the Harris survey 
find the media too liberal, wants the Clinton Administration to force 
balanced reporting?
<DD>
When we had the so called "Fairness Doctrine" in 
force, we didn't have radio and television talk shows as we now know 
them because most stations didn't want the burden of providing repines 
time for opposing viewpoints.
<DD>
Government is not the solution to this very serious problem just as 
government is not the solution to much of anything. This calls to mind 
the statement of Senator Bill Cohen of Maine, Clinton's new Defense 
Secretary." Government," he said, "is the enemy  until you need a 
friend." I am afraid that is the attitude of far too many Americans 
these days. We complain about the excesses of big government, but as 
soon as there is a problem as big as this one is, we want the 
government to solve it. The government is the last place we want to 
turn to solve the problem of inaccurate, biased and abusive media. Most 
Americans don't seem to understand that they have the power to control 
all of this. If we don't buy their papers, advertisers won't spend 
their money to reach fewer and fewer numbers. These papers will go out 
of business. If we turn off the news shows on radio and television that 
we find are biased and provide one sided coverage, the ratings will do 
them in.
<DD>
We don't need government. We need to match our outrage with 
the media with our willingness to continue to buy their product. That's 
all for Direct Line for tonight.

<h2>U.S. Inherits Soviet Traits</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>Two recent incidents with two different airlines well illustrate how the United States is fast becoming a nation of bureaucratic rules rather than a nation of individuals empowered to make common sense judgments.
<dd>The other day I had to make a quick trip to Phoenix to address the annual meeting of the Arizona Transit Association. I chose Southwest Airlines out of Baltimore Washington International airport because that airline saved me literally four hours over the other choice I was given, was a United flight out of Dulles airport.
<dd>Southwest is a well-run and efficient airline with lower fares than all of the competition.
<dd>Somehow they have managed to get in and out of interim terminals in 20 minutes while their competition takes at least an hour. The only problem with Southwest is that in order to keep costs down they always seem to have the last gates in any given terminal concourse. Gates are usually auctioned off and Southwest wants to pay the lowest price possible in order to keep their fares down.
<dd>As some viewers know, I broke my back early this year and am held together by 16 metal parts. I am very blessed to be walking at all. I can now walk reasonably well but when I have to carry a bag it is quite difficult. I had only one bag when I arrived at BWI. When I got through the security system, which at BWI now requires that hand carried bags be unpacked and searched, I asked if there was an electric cart to take me to gate 16 at the very end of the concourse. I was told that Southwest did not operate such carts, whereas other airlines on other concourses did. They do need to cut costs to keep the fares low. So I managed to walk carrying my bag to the end of the terminal. I wanted to check in early because on Southwest, there is open seating. Southwest doesn't serve real food and this was 1 p.m. so I wanted to get something to eat, but the cafeteria was half way down the concourse. So after I received my boarding pass, I asked the gate attendant if I could leave my bag with him, explaining my circumstances. Southwest is known for its cheerful, even funny employees. Not this fellow. He literally growled at me, &quot;Your bag has to be attended at all times.&quot; I replied, &quot;yes and if you keep it, it will be.&quot; Then he really got surly. &quot;You have to keep your bag with you at all times,&quot; he barked. So off I went carrying my bag. When I got to the cafeteria, the arrangement was such that I could not set it down anywhere and keep an eye on it. So I carried my bag and a tray at the same time. Unfortunately carrying both elevated was more than I could handle and some of the contents on the tray ended up on the floor.
<dd>The second incident involved a United flight out of New York. We pulled away from the gate and onto the runway, whereupon the pilot came on and said, &quot;We're sorry folks, we are 18th in line and because of the weather, take-offs are very slow. We will be here at least a half hour.&quot; The man across the aisle from me summoned the stewardess. He told her, &quot;I almost missed this plane. I didn't have a chance to get to the bathroom and I was counting on going after takeoff. I need to get to the bathroom.&quot; She told him emphatically, &quot;You must stay in your seat while we are on the runway.&quot; He asked again: &quot;Please, this is really an emergency. I am not feeling well.&quot; She got very agitated for no good reason as the gentleman was as polite as could be. &quot;You stay in your seat and if you try to get up I will have you arrested,&quot; she told him. At that point other passengers around the man hissed and booed at her. I got her attention and told her, &quot;You know if this man is ill and suffers any damage as the result of your order he could sue you.&quot; At that point she threatened to have me arrested. Then just like the Soviet attendants on Aeroflot used to do before the collapse of the Soviet Union she stood in the aisle of the plane with her hands on her hips and shouted, &quot;I have complete authority to enforce FAA regulations. If anyone else objects I will get the police.&quot; The poor man was forced to sit there in agony for over 40 minutes until the plane was in the skies and the captain had turned off the seat belt sign.
<dd>In an earlier time, in both instances, an attendant would have been able to use his own judgment. To the Southwest gate attendant I had pointed out that my bag had just been completely unpacked and repacked and that he himself had removed the red tag indicating that the bag was okay. I don't think I exactly fit the profile of a terrorist. He should be allowed to make such judgments. Aboard the United flight the other passengers all assured the stewardess that if she let the man go to the bathroom, they would not ask for the same privilege. No, this &quot;lady&quot; wanted to play the role of the enforcer.
<dd>The irony is that on my last Aeroflot flight from Ulan Bataar to Moscow, the stewardesses were as polite and helpful as could be. They accommodated several unusual requests from passengers. They now have competition from Mongolian Air which is a superbly run U.S.-style airline using Boeing 737's.
<dd>Maybe the late Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov was correct. He predicted convergence between the Soviet system and ours. As far as I can see, the Russians are becoming more like the United States used to be and we are becoming more like the Soviets used to be, a land of mindless regulations where the individual counts for nothing.

<h2>
Strategic Control in the Hands of Liberal Senators
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>There has been a great deal of talk about how Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott is leading the most conservative group of Republican Senators in at least 50 and maybe even 70 years.
<dd>True enough. And it is also true that there is only a small group of liberal Republicans left: Chafee (Rhode Island), Jeffords (Vermont), Specter (Pennsylvania), Collins and Snowe (Maine), with Warner (Virginia) and Gorton (Washington) and sometimes D'Amato (New York) falling into the moderate category.
<dd>By my count that leaves 47 votes ranging from moderate conservative to rock solid conservative in the GOP Caucus. I call that a pretty good majority, 47 - 8.
<dd>So the policies coming out of the Senate should be pretty good, right? In fact, most commentators have suggested that it will be the Senate which takes conservative initiatives now, not the House as it was in the 104th Congress.
<dd>Well, think again. Thanks to the new Senate GOP Conference Chairman Connie Mack having chosen Senator Slade Gorton (Washington) to chair the Committee on Committees, and thanks to only a two-vote margin of Republicans vs. Democrats on each committee, it is now the case that the moderate and liberal Republicans are controlling the show. They are strategically placed on each major committee so that all one of them has to do is to vote with the solid lineup of liberal Democrats and they can block anything positive from getting out of committee. In the case of the finance Committee, Senator Bill Roth (Delaware) is stuck with two such votes so this Committee Chairman, who is as solid as a rock on taxation issues, can't control his own committee.
<dd>That puts these eight Senators in control of the agenda. Either the Committee Chairman compromises with them or they vote with the Democrats and nothing happens. Of course a couple of them, Jeffords and Chafee, remain Committee Chairman themselves, thanks to a lack of fortitude on the part of any of the Conservative Senators to challenge them under the new rules of the GOP caucus. So in those cases, they can control what is even discussed in Committee. 
<dd>How a rip roaring majority of 47 can be outdone by eight is really an incredible development. Apparently Senator Mack (Florida), who had just been elected Conference Chairman, was just too naive to figure out what was happening. A good question is this: Since he is supposed to be such a solid conservative, how is it that, out of the whole group of 47, he managed to ask one of the group of eight to be in charge of the Committee selection process?
<dd>Unless the Senate leadership wants to now take the highly unusual step of initiating legislation from the floor instead of in committee, don't look for any positive, constructive pro-growth, pro-family measures coming out of the Senate. You don't have to worry about the Democrats filibustering such proposals. Heck, they'll all be killed in committee.

<h2>
Political Correctness and the Media
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>On the show "Ways and Means" Tuesday night, my colleague Bob Siegrist and I had as one of our guests Mr. Roderick Conrad of Project 21, the black conservative group. We were discussing the brutal attack by Congressman Clay of Missouri, the Chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, on the just defeated black Republican Congressman Gary Franks. We asked Mr. Conrad twice what was driving political correctness in the black community and twice he replied, "the media" - an interesting answer.
<dd>Both Siegrist and I have been around long enough to have witnessed the profound change which has taken place in media circles which makes Mr. Conrad's answer the correct one. Mind you, most who populated the media were always liberal. But despite that they played by certain rules.
<dd>Siegrist's reporting career dates to the late 1930's, and mine to the late 1950's. Siegrist was once the celebrated prodigy of the powerful WGN radio in Chicago. Both of us worked for the Milwaukee Sentinel a decade apart. He wrote editorials. I covered local politics. About 31 years ago, I worked for Bob Siegrist as an editorial assistant. At the time, Siegrist had put together his own radio network to carry a daily commentary show. (Yes, Rush Limbaugh wasn't the first in the nation to do so). I was hired by Siegrist because he knew I generally agreed with his point of view. But I found out all too quickly that when it came to the copy I wrote for his show every day, he could have cared less about my opinion. He wanted facts. If I couldn't back up every word I wrote with cold hard data, I was in big trouble.
<dd>I mention all of this because even in this case, when I was hired because I had a point of view, I was expected to put that aside to help Siegrist deliver accurate information. When I was working for the Milwaukee Sentinel during the Goldwater campaign of 1964, the management made it clear that I was not to cover the campaign because of my political passion for the then Senator from Arizona. I sat across from Cy Rice, who did cover the campaign, and even though I heard his interviews and what he said privately afterwards, I never knew his political views and readers couldn't tell either.
<dd>That is the way it was back then and the way lots of people still think it is now. As recently as 1984, I received from one of the major daily papers in San Francisco an unsolicited letter of apology after running a tough piece written by one of its reporters. The reporter had soundly trashed a pro-family conference we were running there just prior to the Democratic convention of that year. The reporter turned out to be a homosexual activist who hated what we stood for. In the letter of apology, the paper's managing editor said he had not understood this when he assigned the reporter to cover us, and when he found out he removed the reporter from that assignment. The managing editor assured me we would receive fair treatment from there on out. We did.
<dd>That would not happen today. Whereas back then if editors found out you were involved with one group or the other, if they didn't fire you for such activity, they made it clear that you could not cover the activities of such a group. At the time I was an active journalist, black reporters  were not assigned to cover the civil rights movement precisely because editors felt they had an emotional stake in the coverage.
<dd>It is exactly the opposite today. Today homosexual reporters are deliberately assigned to cover the recent court decision on same sex marriages in Hawaii on the grounds that only they understand the feelings of that community and thus can give the correct picture of the impact of that decision. Black reporters cover the civil rights movement. That accounts for the astounding statement by Mr. Conrad that his organization, Project 21, which is the leading organization of black conservatives in the country, had yet to receive a single call from the national media asking for reaction to Congressman Clay's assertion that Congressman Franks had sold out his race because he didn't follow the liberal line. In today's media, if you are not a liberal woman, the assumption is that you cannot possibly comprehend the women's movement, so mostly radical feminist women today write about the so-called women's movement. That's why the white reporter for the Washington Times was told by the black principal and students at a Washington, DC, school to get her "white ass"  --  forgive the direct quote  --  out of the school. You see, in today's media no white person can possibly write accurately about the conditions of the oppressed blacks. Anyway, you get the picture.
<dd>Well, then, hearing all of this, you may think that things probably balance out because these same media outlets hire conservatives to cover the conservative movement and born again Christians to cover evangelicals. Wrong. That doesn't happen because from today's media perspective, what is happening in those movements is largely irrelevant. We are in what the New York Times has labeled "the post Christian era." As to conservatives and Republicans, even the back-to-back Republican control of Congress for the first time in 68 years is looked on as a temporary aberration on the inevitable road to resurgent liberalism, so why bother.
<dd>Siegrist and I were always a minority in our chosen profession. But it didn't matter as much then. True, it did effect what stories were covered. But once a decision was made to cover a story, even liberal reporters felt some obligation to cover the facts without getting caught up in the insider feelings of the moment.
<dd>No, what you are getting today, which passes for news and factual information, is beyond bias. It is a reflection of the agenda of those who are doing the reporting. That is why, more than ever, you need NET. We have an agenda too. But it isn't partisan. It is called telling the truth. Three years ago when we started NET, I was asked by Stone Phillips of NBC who was going to provide the balance in NET's coverage. I replied that we are the balance, and I said "we need a whole network just to balance out Bryant Gumbel." I haven't been back on the "Today" show since. That's just fine. I stand by my statement.

<h2>
Leadership in Lott
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
 <DD>Trent Lott was re-elected Senate Majority Leader
today by his fellow Republicans without any opposition. He leads
the most conservative group of Senate Republicans since, perhaps,
the 1920's.  Lott is a symbol of the changes in his own party.
He came to Washington as a Democrat. He served on the staff of
the late William Colmer, Chairman of the House Rules Committee,
and one of the last of the crusty old Conservative Democrats to
rule a House Committee with an iron hand.
<DD>
 Lott left Colmer to run for the House as a Republican
in 1972, the year that Richard Nixon swept the South. Ed Feulner
and I told Lott he was crazy for doing so. [Feulner, now the President
of the Heritage Foundation, back then was an influential House
staffer.] Lott could see already then what we didn't yet recognize
and that was that the Republicans were going to one day dominate
the South.
<DD>
 In 1980 when Ronald Reagan swept many new and conservative
Republicans into the House, Lott ran for and was elected House
GOP whip. He defeated Bud Shuster, the favorite of the GOP establishment
at the time. He held that position, largely in frustration, under
Bob Michel for eight years and finally opted to run for the Senate.
<DD>
 When in 1994 another large crop of freshmen Senators
was swept into office, Lott challenged then Majority Whip Alan
Simpson and defeated him by one vote. When Bob Dole resigned,
Lott faced off against his fellow Mississippian Thad Cochran and
beat him 44 to 8. Lott has never lost an election at home or in
the Congress.
<DD>
 It is clear that Lott knows when to hold 'em and
when to fold 'em. Two votes were added to Lott's majority in an
election which saw Bill Clinton sweep the nation. Not only that,
most of the incoming Republican Senators are more conservative
than the Republicans they replaced. The liberal wing of the party
is down to a few votes.
<DD>
 But the one thing Lott doesn't have which he had
when he entered the leadership in 1980 is conservative Democrats.
Lott became famous for being able to reach across the aisle to
get votes for Ronald Reagan's favorite programs. Conservative
Democrats trusted him. He may have changed parties but at heart
he was still one of them. Today when Lott looks across the aisle,
he finds almost no moderate to conservative Democrats left. Those
he could get from time to time in the last session, Heflin of
Alabama, Johnston of Louisiana, Exon of Nebraska, are all gone,
replaced either by Republicans or liberal Democrats.
<DD>
 In the Senate, even if Lott can keep his 55 Republicans
together on some votes, he still needs another five votes to break
a filibuster. Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle knows that and
will play it for all it is worth.
<DD>
 Lott is, when all is said and done, a wily Southerner.
He likes to make deals, but sometimes, when he feels a great principle
is at stake, he can be tough as nails. Following the Civil War,
Southerners learned to adjust. They learned to sound accommodating
even when they didn't intend to be. Lott is very much that way.
What you see and hear is not always what you get. And that often
surprises friends and enemies alike.
<DD>
Lott is the most clever GOP leader in the Senate
since the late Everett Dirksen passed on to his eternal reward
in 1969. He is a man who keeps his word once you can be absolutely
sure what his word is.
<DD>
Lott is someone who knows how to use power, but he
uses it very sparingly. He is often compared with former Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell. He likes the comparison. Mitchell
just smiled and smiled while he was driving a stake through the
heart of the Republicans. Lott wouldn't mind repaying the favor
from time to time.
<DD>
 Lott will have at his side a conservative team to
help him. That team reflects where the GOP has gone these past
years: Don Nickels from Oklahoma as whip; Larry Craig of Idaho
as Policy Committee Chairman; Connie Mack of Florida as Conference
Chairman; Paul Coverdell of Georgia as Conference Secretary; Mitch
McConnell of Kentucky as Chairman of the Senatorial campaign committee.
The South and the West, that is where Republicans tend to do well
and that is where the leadership team comes from.
<DD>
The Senate is a far different place than it was 30
years ago when I first encountered it. Half of the GOP membership
back then was liberal and Southern Conservative Democrats dominated
the structure.
<DD>
Trent Lott is truly a creature of the body which
he will lead for another Congress. As with the South itself, what
change comes about during his term will be incremental, steady
and managed. Trent Lott is no revolutionary but in terms of the
Senate itself, it is revolutionary that he is its leader.<BR>

<h2>
Clinton's Difficult Choice
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>Poor Janet Reno. She can't win no matter what she does. Just a few days ago, the Republicans were singing the praises of the Attorney General calling her "honest and independent". That was because close aides of the President had been all over town telling anyone who would listen in the media that the President wanted to dump Miss Reno because she had been too willing to apply the independent counsel statute. Four times she had invoked that procedure regarding Clinton Administration officials and so there are that many high level investigations going on at the present moment.
<dd>The White House was especially concerned that the Attorney General would invoke the independent counsel statute in the matter of the foreign fund-raising practices of the Democrats, which became an issue in the final days of the 1996 campaign.
<dd>Well, whether the threat to her job was enough to get her attention, or whatever the reason, and at this point the lady deserves the benefit of the doubt, Janet Reno declined to invoke the independent counsel statute in the Democratic party fund-raising case. In her reply to Senator John McCain of Arizona, signed by a Deputy Attorney General, Janet Reno said one thing which is absolutely true and another which is highly questionable. First, she said that the statute itself was not designed to cover issues involving a political party, which is a private organization. True enough. But then the Attorney General went on to say that there is no evidence that either the President or Vice President has been improperly involved in the case (which, if true, would trigger the statute) and thus the investigation will be handled internally by the Justice Department and not by an independent counsel. But that statement misses the whole point.
<dd>We don't know what the role of the President and Vice President was in this episode. True, they both have denied any wrong doing. Richard Nixon also assured us he wasn't a crook. But it is essential to understand just what sort of influence foreign money paid in determining our government's policies. While Al Gore says he had no idea that a fund-raiser at a Buddhist Temple handled illegal contributions, (including several $5,000 contributions from Buddhist nuns who had taken a vow of poverty), the really suspicious activities involve the President himself. He met several times with Democratic fund-raiser John Huang, formerly with the powerful Indonesian conglomerate known as the Lippo group. In at least one case, U.S. policy toward Indonesia changed following one of those meetings. Maybe that was all just coincidence, but that, at least, is one huge question mark hanging over this matter.
<dd>So Senator McCain, (who had written Reno to ask her to invoke the independent counsel statute) and Majority Whip Don Nickles of Oklahoma, have both suggested that in view of Reno's decision, the Republican majority in Congress will just have to hold hearings on Democratic fundraising. That is entirely appropriate under the circumstances, because those hearings will put pressure on the internal unit at the Department to Justice to make its investigation honest.
<dd>Attorney General Reno did say that if the internal investigation warranted it, an independent counsel could always be appointed later. Maybe after the President reassures her that she will be retained during her second term she will feel more liberated to act.
<dd>The issue, in any case, is not going away. Now the Attorney General has earned harsh words from the same folks who had been lauding her  just days ago. It remains to be seen, however, if the White House aides who had been trashing her will now feel she has demonstrated sufficient loyalty to the President to be kept on the job. Bill Clinton has a big problem regarding Janet Reno. If he fires her, he will suffer great political damage because the assumption will be that she got the axe because she was too anxious to see his Administration investigated. On the other hand, if he retains her, he does run the risk of her rediscovering her independence because she retains considerable credibility with the media and the Congress and could easily recover from this temporary setback.
<dd>Yes, poor Janet Reno. The lady is not well physically and she has problems no matter which way she elects to go. It is Bill Clinton who deserves the real pity, however. He has a problem if he fires his Attorney General and he may well have a problem if he doesn't. It is for this reason that Presidents have always looked for close friends to put in that position. Janet Reno was Bill Clinton's third choice. They hadn't even met until he made the appointment. Maybe, considering all the trouble he is in, Bill Clinton really wants a close friend in the  Attorney General's office. Too bad Vince Foster didn't live to see this day. He might well have made the ideal Attorney General for Bill Clinton.

<h2>
Time to Reform the FDA
</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>Another in the long line of appointees of President Clinton is stepping down and in this case, not a moment too soon.
<dd>David A. Kessler will resign early next year as head of the Food and Drug Administration. Actually he was first appointed by President George Bush, but toward the end of the Bush Administration he signaled that he really was a Clinton supporter and Clinton kept him on as FDA Commissioner.
<dd>During his tenure, Kessler engineered several major power grabs which opponents contend are unconstitutional at worst or against the will of Congress at best.
<dd>Actually, Kessler's adventures against tobacco, widely embraced by Bill Clinton, is one of the key factors in continued Republican control in the House of Representatives. Although union and environmentalist money defeated many GOP incumbents in the North, Republicans picked up enough seats in the South to offset those gains and Republicans hung on to the House. Several GOP incumbents in the South and border states, thought originally to be in political trouble, all kept their seats due in part to the Administration's war on tobacco.
<dd>Kessler's departure comes at a time when Congress was beginning to take an increasing interest in his power maneuvers. There were signs that the 105th Congress was finally going to confront the FDA chief so Kessler probably thought it was a good time to get going. Former FDA General Counsel Peter Barton Hut said Kessler's unexpected announcement yesterday was "great news both for the FDA and for the public health." The FDA is "in the worst state of disarray in four decades," Hut said. The agency "now needs a real leader who will focus on the agency and not on their own personal agenda."
<dd>Indeed that is Kessler's legacy.
<dd>He greatly expanded FDA's power and in the process ran roughshod over the legislative process. The more controversial his actions became the more he seemed to enjoy the fight. Ralph Nader-style proponents of big government view him in heroic terms. Business concerns which were victims of his arbitrary and often capricious harassment view him as the devil incarnate.
<dd>As with all practitioners of power politics in Washington, he got a bit carried away with his own office. The Washington Legal Foundation just issued a report accusing Kessler of padding his expense account during his tenure. In truth, that may have prompted his resignation more than anything else. Better to leave now while some segments of the media and the public consider you a hero, then to fight charges which will tarnish your image and give opponents the opening they had longed for.
<dd>President Clinton has made noises about accommodating the realities of a Republican Congress by appointing more centrist people in his Administration. The FDA would be an excellent place to demonstrate his sincerity.
<dd>While Commissioner Kessler has used his time and energy to assume jurisdiction over products where he had no authority to do so, the United States has lagged way behind the rest of the developed nations of the world in approving new life-saving drugs. It is a travesty that U.S. citizens now have to travel abroad to seek medical treatment deemed safe in Europe and Japan but not available here. The poor, which Kessler and his friends always claimed they were championing, cannot afford to go abroad for treatment. They have been left to die untreated here at home. Kessler was bold in seeking new power, but extraordinarily timid in taking action to save the lives of U.S. citizens.
<dd>Congress should now pass legislation to reform the agency to force it to function as it was set up to do. The FDA  ought to swiftly test and put on the market new products that further the health of the nation. The FDA ought to get out of those areas where Congress has not given it jurisdiction.
<dd>The President, for his part, should look for someone sensible to head the agency. Kessler, for all of his great public relations, has actually succeeded only in tying up the agency with various lawsuits which will take years to settle. Those law suits can be put behind us if the President will make the right appointment. Bill Clinton won't appoint any conservative to office, but he doesn't have to appoint a power-mad ideologue either.
Now we will get a chance to see if Bill Clinton wants to behave as a "New Democrat," at long last, or if he intends to replace Kessler with another headline-seeking Commissioner with his own agenda. That choice, which is bound to be given significant scrutiny by the Congress, will tell us a great deal about Bill Clinton's plans for a second term.

<h2>
The Speaker's Profound Remarks
</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<DD>
Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, who was approved by his party caucus for another term as leader of the House of Representatives, said something very important which got little coverage yesterday. The media was busy talking about the Speaker's pledge to cooperate with President Clinton and his acknowledgment that he had made some mistakes.
<P>
<DD>
Yet of far more profound significance were these words by Speaker Gingrich:
"The country will never again be healthy if we don't have the courage to confront the spiritual and cultural and moral deficit that is an even greater threat to our future than the economic deficit.
<P>
<DD>
"In the core documents of our freedoms, the Declaration of Independence, is says unequivocally, we are 'endowed by Our Creator with certain unalienable rights'. And I think we have an obligation to reassert in a calm, open way, involving people of all backgrounds, each approaching God in their own unique way, that this nation comes from God, that it is in fact only successful when it is submissive to God's will, that while all of us are sinners and all of us fall short, that does not excuse any of us forgetting where our powers and our responsibilities come [from]; and somehow reestablishing in the public square that it is legitimate, in fact it is vital, that we recognize the degree to which, in the broadest sense, if America does not get its rights from Our Creator, there is no explanation of America and there is no way of thinking of the future. 
<P>
<DD>
"I am not suggesting here in any way a state religion. I'm not suggesting in any way a theocracy. But I am suggesting to you that if you read Lincoln and you read the Founding Fathers and you read as recently as FDR, and then you look at our modern 30-second attack commercials and you look at the decay in our society, that maybe we lost a great deal when we became too timid to talk openly about the source of the American dream and the source of our rights and that we have an obligation to re-establish them."
To this I can only add "Amen and Amen." It is a mark of our time that the Speaker feels he would have to add as many qualifiers as he did in making a very valid statement. The early leaders of our nation were much more straight forward in proclaiming their belief in God.
<P>
<DD>
Important civil documents invoke the name of the "Most Holy Trinity." The argument then was between those such as Thomas Jefferson, who acknowledged a distant deity and those who proclaimed that we were a Christian nation, albeit one which was tolerant of other beliefs.
<P>
<DD>
Today the argument is between those who want only to acknowledge God in the public square, as the Speaker did in his speech, and those who insist that belief in God is at most a private matter, and any utterance or acknowledgment of God in the outside world is not only improper but should be forbidden. Unfortunately, in what the New York Times has described as the "post-Christian era in America," those who want not to separate church and state but to ban God from government, have won the day.
<P>
<DD>
Viewers know I have many differences with the Speaker. But I applaud him for raising this issue. He did so on the day on which his father, Robert Gingrich, who had adopted him at age three, died of cancer at age 71.
<P>
<DD>
The words of Speaker Gingrich were a fitting tribute to the only father he ever knew. There is something that happens to us when our fathers die. We begin to look at life more seriously. Somehow when they are still alive, we think of ourselves still as kids, no matter how old we or they may be. But when we lose our fathers, we understand that the future now is up to us. We take responsibilities more seriously.
<P>
<DD>
I believe in the Providence of God. I believe nothing happens by accident. The Speaker said with the passing of his Dad, he felt strongly that he had to bring up the issue of God in the public square, even though it might be a little controversial. I believe he was inspired to do so. The Speaker spoke the truth.
<P>
<DD>
Let us ask Almighty God to find rest for Robert Gingrich in a place where there is no pain nor grief but only everlasting life. Let us ask that same God to inspire and bless Speaker Gingrich that he might find the wisdom and strength to do exactly what he suggested needs to be done: namely to help to reestablish God's rightful place in the affairs of mankind.
<P>

<h2>
The Declining Conscience of America
</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>
Those who watched this program regularly earlier this year may recall that when President Clinton vetoed the Partial Birth Abortion measure, I predicted that this would be the high water mark of his administration. That act, I suggested, would bring about his defeat in the Fall. It is true that Clinton, who at that moment enjoyed a 56% approval rating, the highest of his Presidency for more than a day or two, never did achieve that high water mark again. But it is not true that this issue made a controlling difference in this election. 
<p>
<dd>
The liberal columnist Mark Shields, also host of CNN's Capital Gang, said today that post election survey data revealed that abortion was important to a much greater portion of the electorate than had originally been believed. Moreover, of those for whom abortion was deemed their most important issue in this election, Bob Dole defeated Bill Clinton two to one. So much for the myth that the so called pro choice position is an automatic winner with the electorate. It can be correctly argued that abortion did not effect the outcome of the Presidential race because Bob Dole refused to make it an issue. 
<p>
<dd>
Even when, in the final debate, a minister handed Bob Dole a soft ball question about the decline in morality in America, Dole did not raise the issue and gave President Clinton a pass. Unless voters went to one of the churches where pastors made this an issue or unless voters received mailings from the National Right to Life Committee, they probably were simply unaware that this was an issue. Indeed, another survey released last week revealed that among voters who followed and understood the issues, Dole was a decisive winner. 
<p>
<dd>
But among those who simply voted without following what was going on in the country, Bill Clinton won in a landslide. There were races, however, where the abortion issue became a principal focus. In Louisiana, retired Archbishop Philip Hannan declared that it would be a sin for Catholics to vote for Democratic Senate candidate Mary Landrieu because of her abortion position. What followed was days of discussion in the media about the separation of church and state, so that voters almost could not escape hearing about the issue. Since Louisiana has the greatest share of Catholics in the South, Hannan's statement was thought to be the death blow to Landrieu. But, barring the ability of Republican candidate Woody Jenkins to present evidence to the Senate of overwhelming fraud, Mary Landrieu will take her place as a Senator in January. Just a few years ago a statement such as Hannan made on abortion would have been a death blow to Landrieu. There is at least some evidence that Hannan's statement may have actually moved some Catholic voters to vote for Landrieu out of spite. 
<p>
<dd>
Likewise in Iowa, the race for the Senate against incumbent Senator Tom Harkin became, in the words of Congressman Jim Ross Lightfoot's campaign manager John Maxwell "a referendum on partial birth abortion". Lightfoot's initiative on the issue hurt incumbent Senator Harkin badly enough that it forced Harkin to air a television commercial accusing Lightfoot of distorting his record. Harkin claimed that he really was against partial birth abortion. That caused Lightfoot to air a commercial featuring a retired Catholic priest who looked like he stepped out of a Bing Crosby movie. The priest explained partial birth abortion and said Harkin had not told the truth when he said he was against it because he had voted to keep the procedure legal twice. Then the priest looked into the camera and said :'If Harkin would lie about this...." The commercial ended. It seemed to do the trick. Lightfoot came back up in the polls. But on the day before the election President Clinton came to Iowa and supported Harkin on the issue and Harkin went on to win the closest Senate contest against an incumbent. 
<p>
<dd>
But still Harkin won. So I was dead wrong about America. The Presidential race can be explained away. The Iowa and Louisiana Senate races cannot be. Yes, both were very close races. Yes there were many other issues involved. But abortion was front and center in both cases long enough for the electorate to make an informed choice. The electorate went for the candidate who supported near infanticide, the act of killing a baby by sucking its brains out moments before it is delivered from the Mother's womb. Because I thought America still had a conscience, I was confident that this issue would be decisive with voters. It was with some, but not enough.  
<p>
<dd>
I regret to say that I was wrong about this issue, not because I made a mistake. The Good Lord knows that I make lots of mistakes every single day. I regret that I was wrong not because the candidates I hoped would win lost. I regret to say I was wrong because of what it says about the American electorate. It tells me that no matter how brutal the crime, no matter how unconscionable the act, no matter how dire the consequences for the society, a majority of those who bother to show up at the polls will blind themselves to reality. That, my friends, does not bode well for the survival of our nation.

<h2>Public Prayer Launches Romanias New Era</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<DD>
It was a scene worthy of a Cecil B. De Mille production. Thousands of people were gathered in University
Square early Monday morning in Bucharest, Romania, as Emil Constantinescu addressed them from a 
balcony overlooking the square. "I am here to tell you that I will never betray you. We are here for the people 
who fought the guns with their bodies," Constantinescu said. With that, the new President-elect of Romania 
asked the crowd to pray with him. Thousands of people dropped to their knees, bowed their heads and 
recited The Lord's prayer.
<DD>
Thus began a new era in Romanian history, the last of the Eastern European nations to shed the old 
Communist regime. At Christmas time in 1989, just after the Berlin Wall came down and following changes 
in other Eastern European nations, Communist Dictator Nicholas Ceaucescu was captured and executed. 
The man who gave the order for the execution was Ion Illiescu, who subsequently was elected and then 
re-elected President of Romania. He loosened some government controls of people's lives which Ceaucescu 
had imposed, but he kept his government in the hands of the Socialists. Almost no privatization. Huge heavy 
and unproductive industries still owned and operated by the government. Rampant inflation and a population 
which could scarcely get by.
<DD>
Illiescu was able to keep control with his own cleverness. His agents infiltrated the Democratic 
opposition and caused them to fight each other over the smallest of points. He inaugurated political parties 
with near identical names to those of the Democratic parties so that uneducated peasants would have trouble
 telling the difference. His tactic worked. His neo-Communist Socialists hung on for seven long years.
<DD>
Finally the Democratic opposition got its act together. Finally the voters caught on to who was really 
responsible for the terrible conditions in their country. It began earlier this year when anti-Communists swept
 municipal elections. Following that, in the November 3rd parliamentary elections, the Socialists were roundly
 defeated, leading to Sunday's runoff election for the Presidency. Romania has finally taken the step which 
everyone else in Eastern Europe took years ago.
<DD>
Bob Krieble and I and our team of political trainers were the first Western democracy specialists into 
Romania, just two months after Ceaucescu was killed. Candles were still burning day and night in the streets 
under mounted icons to commemorate those who were killed in the bloody exchanges culminating in the 
Dictator's death.
<DD>
Religious believers were still meeting secretly in apartments. There were no street lights at night. 
Neighborhoods took on an eerie feeling as people shuffled about in the dark. Streetcars rumbled through the 
city jammed with passengers, but with lights off. Foreigners were looked at with suspicion. I recall one lady 
approaching me in the back of an Orthodox church, speaking to me in German. I replied that I spoke English. 
She then asked me where I was from. I said America. She threw her arms around me and began to cry. 
"God Bless you for coming here," she said, surprising herself at her public display of emotions which 
attracted the attention of other worshipers in the now-jammed church. "You are the first foreigner I ever spoke 
to," she sobbed. "Two months ago, I would have been executed if I had spoken to you this way," she beamed. 
It was a scary place. Our meetings to teach the fractured opposition were infiltrated by the Communists.
<DD>
The opposition parties, then coming out of hiding after decades in the underground, were fixated on the past, 
each blaming the other for Romania's decades of suffering under Communism. Our pleas that they work 
together at first fell on deaf ears. But gradually the efforts to divide and conquer the opposition were 
recognized and overcome.
<DD>
To Bob Krieble's credit, we continued to do training there in the years to come, long after many others had 
given up and pulled out. Sunday that effort finally paid off.
<DD>
Romania followed Bulgaria, which had just elected an anti-Communist parliament a couple of weeks ago 
along with a pro-free market President as well. Now comes the hard part. Romania is so far behind, it will take
an extraordinary effort to catch up.
<DD>
In today's Washington Post, right next to the article about the developments in Romania, is a long article to 
the effect that the economic policies of Margaret Thatcher, 17 years after she first took office, are now finally 
paying off for Britain big time. Things are booming in the old British empire. But that took 17 years of 
uninterrupted rule by the Conservative party -- the same party which the voters seem poised to retire from 
office next year.
<DD>
Romania, in this new highly competitive atmosphere in Europe led by Britain, will find the going rough. 
However, the suffering people there kneeling in the streets praying to the Lord is an auspicious start. The 
situation may look on paper hopelessly complicated, but the Romanians know, with God all things are 
possible.

<h2>Dornan Will be Missed</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>Congressman Bob Dornan called me yesterday afternoon to say that in the absentee ballot count, he had lost his race for re-election. Dornan contends that the election was stolen from him. Boxes and boxes of illegal ballots, he says, were brought in after the polls closed and the voters they supposedly represented were never matched with the voter rolls. Dornan says these are the votes of illegal aliens and he blames the Motor Voter act for making this sort of thing possible.
<dd>Dornan told me that the Republican party, which had pledged to help him go to the wall on this race, has now abandoned him when they realized that they would have to challenge Hispanic groups in the process. Some Hispanic groups have threatened to shut down the Congress if Dornan's opponent, Loretta Sanchez isn't seated. The GOP, he said, doesn't want this sort of confrontation, even if it means losing a seat in the Congress.
<dd>Bob Dornan will be missed. I first met him in 1975 when he was a talk show host in California and I appeared on his show. Ironically, Dornan called me earlier this year when one of the radio networks had approached him with a healthy contract to do a syndicated radio talk show. He has often filled in for Rush Limbaugh. Dornan asked me for my advice on this offer. I told him he should take it, because I was convinced that he would do more good on the outside than he could do on the inside, where he was constantly clashing with the Republican leadership. He did not follow my advice but instead ran for re-election. Now he hopes the network offer is still available.
<dd>Ever since bursting on the electoral scene in 1976, Bob Dornan has been a thorn in the side of liberals. The White House, for example, was thrilled yesterday when they heard that Dornan had gone down. For years Dornan has been on Bill Clinton's back on everything from draft-dodging to baby killing. In 1992 he made more speeches than George Bush warning the nation what the election of Bill Clinton would mean. Unfortunately much of what he predicted would happen has proved to be true.
<dd>Dornan served a total of eighteen years out of the last twenty, taking off a two year stint for an unsuccessful try at the United States Senate. In 1996 he ran for President, not because he ever thought he could win, but because he felt his presence would force the other Presidential candidates to address the social issues. Dornan was wrong about that and his poor showing and prolonged absence from his district were not helpful in his re-election bid. What also didn't help Dornan or others in California was the early declaration by all the media that Bill Clinton had won the Presidency while the polls were still open out there. That caused many Republican leaning voters to skip the election. The Democrats did turn out, but participation by voters in California was at an historic low.
<dd>Bob Dornan will be most remembered for his passion on the issues of the sanctity of life and on our national defense which earned him the nickname B-1 Bob.
<dd>He was always ready for a confrontation. It was Dornan who helped to convince Pope John Paul II to issue the declaration forbidding Catholic priests to hold civil office. That forced Congressman and Catholic priest Robert Drinan to have to retire from his Congressional seat. Dornan particularly disliked Drinan's politics because he felt his fellow Roman Catholic had betrayed his faith.
<dd>It was Dornan who was willing to confront the homosexual lobby. The pro-life movement has other passionate advocates, but no one else in the entire Congress of either party is willing to take on the homosexuals. Dornan did and they were among the groups working hard for his defeat in this election.
<dd>Dornan is from the Fidel Castro school of political rhetoric. He can give a two hour speech and never notice the time. Moreover, I've been present when he has done so with the whole audience sitting on the edge of their chairs hanging on every word. He is tough to follow on the podium, I can tell you from personal experience.
<dd>Perpetually disorganized, Bob Dornan's office always looked like a scene from the movies just as the Second World War concluded. Yet he always knew exactly where everything was.
<dd>Congressman Robert Dornan is above all else a man of his convictions. In an era when pale pastels seems to be the way to get elected, Bob Dornan's colors are blinding. He distinguishes himself from most of his colleagues because he actually believes in what he says.
<dd>Bob Dornan leaves a great void in the Congress. Lots of conservatives were elected last week, but not a one of them has the sort of passion Bob Dornan represented. In that sense, he belongs to another era when politicians, without the benefit of slick television commercials, actually had to excite people. That he does. You are either for him or against him.
<dd>Bob Dornan's voice in the Congress may be silenced but I can assure you, you haven't heard the last of him yet. Some radio network will be fortunate enough to employ him and when they do, it won't be long before the nation will be talking about him the way it now talks about Rush Limbaugh.
<dd>He is one of a kind. Without him in the Congress, we need to invent someone just like Bob Dornan.

<h2>Remaining Undecided Races</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>It has been a week since the voters have spoken but throughout the nation not all of the races have been settled yet.
<dd>Oregon supposedly adopted the most modern election system of all with its vote-by-mail operation. In the special election to replace the ousted Senator Bob Packwood, voters could cast their ballots over a three-week period. Well, that system wasn't in effect for this election, but the voters thought it was anyway. So over a third of the state's voters asked for and received absentee ballots. Come election night, officials could declare no winner in the contest to succeed retiring Senator Mark Hatfield. It took until last Friday night to determine that State Senate President Gordon Smith had won the election. Rep. Jim Bunn of Oregon had to wait still another day to find out he had lost his election.
<dd>Meanwhile in California, Rep. Bob Dornan has been hanging on by the skin of his teeth to the 233-vote margin he had on election night. Counting of absentee ballots is proceeding but election officials said they won't release the final results until tomorrow. Why on earth must it take over a week to count absentee ballots? Dornan now thinks there may have been tampering with these same ballots. He is toying with possibly seeking an injunction to keep the election records intact.
<dd>Up the coast in Washington state, not only the networks but also both parties have pronounced Rep. Linda Smith defeated in her re-election bid. The only problem with that is Smith is now leading as officials count the absentee vote. Her office contends there is no way she will lose the election. Meanwhile, in another Washington state district, Rep. Jack Metcalf, who was also pronounced as defeated by everyone, has narrowed the numbers between him and his opponent. If the that trend continues, there is some chance that he, too, could rise from the political dead.
<dd>Down in Louisiana, the canvass of all the precincts shows that Mary Landrieu has defeated State Rep. Woody Jenkins by 5,800 votes out of 1.7 million cast. However, Jenkins is morally certain that more than 5,800 fraudulent votes have been cast in that election. Proving it may be another problem. In Louisiana you sign a document when you register to vote and you sign another document when you actually show up to vote. If there is fraud, a comparison of signatures should do the job. Except that the Motor Voter law, on which Republicans acquiesced to President Clinton, makes those original signature cards, which used to be public documents, private documents. It now takes a court order to permit the Jenkins campaign to inspect the cards and there is no guarantee that the federal court will permit him to do so. If he fails in that attempt, he can ask the United States Senate to examine the election, but that would be unprecedented.
<dd>In Pennsylvania the recount is underway in the district where Rep. Jon Fox has held a 10-vote lead since election day. No one is alleging any fraud in that election. It was just an uncommonly close contest. Likewise, Rep. Peter Torkildsen of Massachusetts is hoping a recount will reverse his paper-thin defeat in that state's Democratic landslide. In these two races, the delay in the final results is justified because the results on election day were about evenly divided. But out on the West Coast, the delays in reporting the results are indefensible. In all three states where I have lived, absentee votes are counted on election day itself and simply added to the total, precinct by precinct. That way both candidates and voters know the results when the totals are reported. True, an election here or there can be so close that a recount must take place before a winner is certified. That happened in the Virginia Senate race of 1978 when John Warner finally emerged the winner by 4,000 some votes. But at least the preliminary totals were known on election night itself. This is all a matter of state regulation and it seems to me those West Coast states would do well to get with the rest of the nation in the way they count their ballots.
<dd>What has happened in Louisiana, however, is quite distinct from the other contests. The Jenkins campaign has been gathering evidence that gambling interests, which had several ballot propositions at stake in that election, spent money illegally to bus voters to the polls, which is not permitted by Louisiana law. Moreover these same gambling interests distributed ballots to those they recruited to vote. The ballots had Mary Landrieu's name on them, which is a likely violation of the law forbidding corporations to participate in federal elections. Jenkins has been an outspoken opponent of gambling in Louisiana. The most outrageous aspect of all of this is the open invitation to fraud which the Motor Voter law has brought about by not making the original registration signature cards available for public inspection. Former Congressman Rick Tonry was elected in that state in the 1970's when corrupt precinct officials added to the tally many of those who had registered but had not shown up to cast their ballots. When the voting records were examined, Congress vacated the seat and ran a new election and Congressman Bob Livingston was the victor of an honest count. In a state with that sort of history, cheating on elections should be made more difficult, not shielded by federal law. Regardless of the ultimate outcome of that cliffhanger, the law there must be changed to make the sort of outcome we are now dealing with in Louisiana impossible to ever happen again.
<dd>If in this day and age elections can still be stolen with ease, then our system of government isn't safe. Who is to say how many Senate votes decided by a margin of one would go the other way if an election had been honest instead of corrupt. The whole nation has a stake in the outcome in Louisiana.

<h2>Speaker Should Step Down Temporarily</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>Oklahoma's just re-elected Congressman Steve Largent has suggested that Newt Gingrich step down as Speaker of the House temporarily until ethics charges against him are cleared up. Gingrich has rejected the idea. 
<dd>Let me say at the outset that I believe that Gingrich will be exonerated from these charges. I have said so from the beginning. I continue to believe that.
<dd>But let me tell you why I think Largent is right when he argues that Gingrich should step aside for the time being.
<dd>One of the most important issues facing this Congress is how to handle the many scandals of the Clinton Administration. If Republicans go after Clinton in what is perceived to be too partisan a manner, they will end up getting into trouble with the voters. On the other hand, the charges against Clinton, unlike those against Gingrich, are serious. Many, especially the recent questions about campaign contributions by foreigners in exchange for subtle changes in US policy, are extremely troubling and could add up to real trouble for the President and his Administration.
<dd>Gingrich has a problem. From the time he took office and defended a multi million dollar book deal to the collapse of his no exit strategy on getting President Clinton to agree to Republican proposals on the federal budget, Gingrich has not fared well image wise with the American public. Add to this the hundreds of millions spent by the unions and others to attack Gingrich, and what we have is a weakened Speaker of the House. Granted, the Democrats do not control the Congress. But the margin is very close. A tarnished Gingrich will have problems upholding the Republicans as ethically sound while he weighs in against the many problems of the Clinton Administration. 
<dd>By stepping aside temporarily as Largent suggests, Gingrich would pave the way for himself to return stronger than ever. In effect, he would wipe the slate clean of his previous problems with the American public.
<dd>I know that would be a tough decision for the Speaker to make. His position is that since he believes he is innocent, there is no reason for him to do this. 
<dd>But think about it for a moment. Gingrich steps aside with an agreement that the investigations against him will be completed by a time certain. He says he is so certain of the outcome that he is willing to take this action so that the American public will have confidence in him and the Republicans when he is vindicated. 
<dd>This action contrasts with Bill Clinton. All we have heard since the election out of the Clinton Administration are rumors about trying to remove Janet Reno as Attorney General. Trying to find  a way to get at Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr. Clinton himself says he wants to go after his political enemies who have made Whitewater and other matters an issue.
<dd>Bill Clinton isn't going to be willing to step aside until he is vindicated of charges against him because, as he well knows, he is not likely to be vindicated. 
<dd>This Administration has been brilliant, however, at deflecting its own problems. Their rule is to attack the attacker. So if Gingrich makes any statements, as he did toward the end of the campaign, about the many serious charges pending against Clinton and his associates, spokesmen for the President will simply say that Gingrich has no right to make such charges when his own house isn't in order. 
<dd>While Harold Volkmer is gone, David Bonior is very much alive. The Gingrich inspired campaign to defeat him failed miserably. Bonior is going to be back full tilt in the 105th Congress. 
<dd>I believe that Steve Largent has suggested a course which is actually best for Speaker Gingrich and the country as a whole. It will enable Gingrich to seize the moral high ground. Assuming I am correct that Gingrich will be vindicated, he would take a short step backward to take a much larger step forward. If cleared of these ethics charges, he would return to the Speakership then with the ability to take on the Clinton Administration without their capacity to point to Gingrich as a way of shielding themselves.
<dd>But, you say, Congressman Bonior and his ilk would just file more charges as soon as the Speaker returns. That is , of course, possible, although Gingrich in the second half of the 104th Congress hasn't gone to the bathroom without checking with the ethics committee first. Yes, Bonior might file more charges but if the Speaker was willing to step aside and was subsequently vindicated, he would show those charges for what they are: pure politics and a payback for his having gone after Democratic Speaker of the House Jim Wright. 
<dd>I am sure that that the initiative Largent took has made Gingrich either hurt or angry. The Speaker should rise above his feelings. Largent has actually suggested a way for Gingrich to restore his moral credibility with the nation.

<h2>Drunkenness at the Helm of Foreign Policy</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<DD>Back in the Cold War days, political leaders routinely saw blocks of nations dividing the international landscape. In those days our heads of state worked hard to maintain a balance between opposing forces: the Communist world and free world; the East against the West; Russia and China verses the United States.
<dd>Apparently, many of our citizens have forgotten the struggle that gave us the Iron Curtain, mutual assured destruction, and communist subversion within the U.S. counterculture.Today a new set of opposing forces has gathered with little notice in the press. 
<dd>While the U.S. is still the dominant force for freedom and democracy, that course is uncertain as we approach the 21st century. Much of the problem rests with an outdated world perspective upon which our elected leaders and appointed officials presuppose our nation's foreign policy. The Administration and its State Department still see the world as a collection of nations divided according to geography. Stabilization, democracy, and now environmental unity are the altruistic goals of the 90s.
<dd>Unfortunately the world has become far more complicated than the two-dimensional map would suggest. Like the Cold War, a serious division has emerged. This time the battle lines have been drawn between opposing cultures, one of which has become united behind a religion whose logical conclusion is world dominance.Unwilling to recognize this, Washington is squandering our nation's military and economic preparedness, by allowing our future to become steadily drunk at the international saloon of the United Nations and its appeasement politics. <dd>Drunkards slur their speech; our foreign policy experts make vague pronouncements. Drunkards are make fools of themselves; America's foreign policy leaders have disgraced their country. Drunkards are slow to react to sudden danger; America's foreign policy drunkards scarcely see what is happening in the world around them: leaders of the modern Islam have declared war on our society.
<dd>Islamic cultural leaders are committed to the ultimate destruction of the United States, which they call the Great Satan. It is a holy war, or jihad, as they call it. The generals of this war have constructed an unlikely alliance with China and Russia. Remember, Communist China still hates the U.S.  Also, half of Russia's population are anti-West and would willingly return to life as a communist nation. Over the past several years, these two nations have helped arm key Islamic client states, such as Syria, Iran and Iraq.Foreign policy inebriation is nothing laughing matter. 
<dd>Our nation cannot remain silent while its elected leaders and their appointees wile away our future and sacrifice our safety, passed out in the UN saloon. As citizens, we must demand from our government the thing our government has no right to possess. We must demand that Washington give America back to the people before it is too late.

<h2>An Examination of Election Results</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<DD>Some random and hopefully not too disconnected thoughts about yesterday's elections. 
<DD>First, we had the lowest voter turnout since the Presidential election of 1924 when the Democratic nominee John Davis was actually more conservative than the Republican incumbent Calvin Coolidge. Those who wanted change opted out. It says a lot about our system when half of those who registered have declined to participate. Candidates of both parties failed to address the real concerns on the minds of the American people. Both parties are on life support systems, but, as if often the case, neither recognizes it yet.
<DD>Second, the big loser in this election was organized labor. They spent a minimum of $200 million to try to buy the Congress and it didn't work. Some of the money which was spent was spent illegally. That needs to be investigated.
<DD>Third, coming out of this election will be a big push for Common Cause-style campaign reform. If the Congress is foolish enough to pass such a bill, it will only make a bad system worse. Yes, we need to get foreign money out of politics. But as far as American citizens are concerned, we need to deregulate the process, not make it more difficult for candidates to comply with cumbersome laws.
<DD>Fourth, the caucuses of both parties in Congress in both Houses will be further apart as the result of the election. Republicans in this Congress are more conservative. It is hard to find liberal Republicans these days. It is equally hard to find conservtive Democrats. The Democrats in the Congress are more liberal.
<DD>Fifth, Bill Clinton may, in due course, wish he had lost. Investigations of wrong-doing in the Administration will continue and this time the Republicans will have their act together a bit better. Moreover, the bills are now going to come due for Bill Clinton from organized labor, the enviornmentalists and the radical lifestyle community. He will have to pay up or risk losing his base. But when he pays up, he will be perceived as moving to the left. That, in turn, will strengthen the Republicans in the next election, known as the six-year-itch election.
<DD>Every six years of a Presidential cycle where one party keeps the Presidency for eight years in a row produces a six-year reaction of great proportions. FDR caught it in 1938. Truman in 1946, Eisenhower in 1958, Johnson in 1966, Reagan in 1986. The last two years of the Clinton Administration, if he survives that long, may turn Clinton into the all-time lame duck.
<DD>Sixth, some of the non-Presidential and Congressional results may be, in the long run, more significant. The California Civil Rights initiavtive was passed handily, dealing a blow to affirmative action programs. Look for similiar initiatives elsewhere in the USA , which may even force the leadership of the 105th Congress to act. Meanwhile, Tax limitation initiatives passed nearly everywhere. A unique term-limits measure passed in nine states and may even yet pass in two others. If upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, this particular measure may finally be the key to winning the term-limits issue at the national level. If a district votes in favor of term limits and the Congressman disregards the voter's wishes, that information would be right there on the ballot the next time that Member of Congress came up for election.
<DD>Seventh, Speaker Newt Gingrich, who became the whipping-boy of the liberals, can take some comfort in the defeat of Harold Volkmer in Missouri. While David Bonior was very strident, Volkmer became a pathalogical opponent of the Speaker's. Volkmer will not be back next year. Gingrich will be. But all the power he managed to get the Republican caucus to cede to him at the beginning of the 104th Congress may not be appropriate for him as he tries to govern his reduced majority in the 105th Congress. He may be forced to give back some of that power to his colleagues to keep the ship together. By the way, the GOP loss in the House which will be anywherefrom 7 to 10 seats, compares very favorably to pick-ups for Presidents being re-elected to a second term. Ronald Reagan, in winning his landslide in 1984, gained 14 seats in the House.  
<DD>Finally, while there were some excellent men and women who were elected to Congress yesterday, there were few known leaders. We suffer so greatly for lack of leadership. Maybe the Lord will see fit to raise a few of them up to help lead this nation back to sanity.
<P>

<h2>Election Results Seldom Meet Expectations</h2>
<p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<dd>In some locations in the nation, the polls are about to close, in others the polls will be open for another four hours yet, but soon enough we will know the verdict of the American people in this election.
<dd>Whatever the outcome, it is good to keep this election in perspective. Every two years I hear several people say, "This is the most important election we have ever faced in our history." Usually they cite some burning issue of the day as their reason for feeling that way. It is true that elections have significance, but usually that significance is not as profound as we think. When FDR was returned to office with a landslide and the Democrats actually gained seats in Congress for the fourth election in a row, FDR thought he could get whatever he wanted. He proposed packing the Supreme Court which had ben resistant to some of his initiatives. Yet it was that very Congress, where FDR's opposition had been reduced to next to nothing, which stopped his court-packing scheme.
<dd>My first election in which I was active in a major way was 1958. I was by then the youngest member ever to serve on the Board of the Young Republicans of Racine, County, Wisconsin. That year, we got wiped out by the explosion of the AFL-CIO's Committee on Political Education or COPE. The Democrats won huge majorities in the Congress. Yet that Congress produced little of what the Democrats wanted. All of President Eisenhower's vetoes were upheld. He actually was a better President with that Congress than he had been when he was dealing with a much friendlier Congress. In fact, that Congress -- which was practically owned by big Labor -- passed the Landrum Griffin Labor Reform act over the strident opposition of the very Members of Congress who had been elected to stop it.
<dd>It is true that in 1964, then Conservative Republican candidate Barry Goldwater got crushed by Lyndon Johnson and the Congress which followed gave us all of the dreadful Great Society legislation we are still trying to cope with today. But also out of that election was born the modern conservative movement which produced Ronald Reagan, first as Governor of California and then as President.
<dd>The Democrats again crushed the Republicans in 1974 and some of my friends were suicidal. Yet that Congress upheld all but one of President Ford's vetoes. By the way, in my three decades here, the two least damaging Congresses were the Congress elected in 1966 and the Congress elected in 1978. Both anticipated the election of Republican Presidents and the Republicans finally got their act together and held off just about everything that was destructive.
<dd>Expectations were high for the Congress which came in with Ronald Reagan in 1980, and indeed the first eight months of the Reagan Administration were exciting and did good things. After that, it was back to more of business as usual. By the second session of that Congress, the largest tax increase in history, up until Bill Clinton's tax bill of 1993, was passed and signed into law by Reagan.
<dd>The election of Bill Clinton with a Democratic Congress in 1992 was very troubling. Yet many bad initiatives were stopped by that Congress, some of which were passed by the Republican Congress which followed it. Expectations were never higher than two years ago. The first few months of the 104th Congress were terribly exhilirating. But that Congress too left town with a whimper with most of its urgent business left undone.  My point is simply this. Whichever way this election goes tonight, it will be neither as good nor as bad as contemporary observers believe it will be. If Bill Clinton gets back in with a Democratic Congress, probably a united and outraged Republican opposition may get its act together. On the other hand if somehow the voters deft the odds and elect Bob Dole with a Republican Congress, true believers out there who think the nation has now been saved will be disappointed. We may, in fact, get mixed results. I have come to believe that the American people do that by design. They give us a President of one party and a Congress of the other because in their minds less damage will be done that way, and sometimes they are correct.
<dd>What is important, in the long run, is not this particular election. What is important is that we begin to face our real problems as a nation. These are not the problems which were ever talked about by the major candidates in this election. They are the sort of problems being discussed by my colleagues Bill Lind and Brad Keena on the "Next Revolution." Sooner or later elected officials will be forced to face those problems. Let us fervently pray that at that moment in our nation's history, there will still be time.

<h2>Politicizing a Murder</h2>
<p>
Direct Line Commentary<br>
by <b>Marianne Lombardi</b>
<blockquote>
<p>
<DD>President Clinton is pretending
to be tough on crime and has taken to exploiting the murder of
12-year old Polly Klaas in order to get re-elected.  <dd>In a television
ad, narrated by Polly Klaas's father, Mark Klaas, he praises President
Clinton for forcing Congress to pass his tough crime bill.  He
goes on to say that the recent attacks on Clinton's character
are just politics and claims the President's character is evident
in his courage to protect children.  <dd>All politicians exploit tragedy
to get elected - Republicans used paroled murderer Willie Horton
as their example of how Michael Dukakis was soft on crime.  Now,
Democrats are doing it to show how Bill Clinton is tough on crime.
<dd>It is an election year, and we should expect nothing less from
any politician - if Mark Klaas were a Republican, I'm sure we'd
see him in a Bob Dole ad.  But the Clinton campaign has gone too
far in using Mark and Polly Klaas to counter Bob Dole's attack
on Clinton's character.  The truth is, Bob Dole has done nothing
that even resembles an attack - he has barely scratched the surface.
<dd>There is so much material fact on Clinton's lack of honor and
morality that this campaign has missed, that the Clinton campaign
would be better off not responding at all.  To top it off, Bill
Clinton is far enough ahead in the polls that there was no need
to even mention the word character. I have to admit that I have
a personal sadness when I see a grieving father embrace an administration
that has done nothing to prevent crime.  In fact, it has encouraged
crime by putting drug prevention on the back burner, putting lenient
judges - anti-death penalty judges - on the bench for life, and
by trying to outlaw ownership of guns by law abiding citizens.
<dd>But Mark Klass is an adult and he is free to endorse whichever
candidate he chooses.  I just don't have the faith that he is
getting all the facts.

<h2>Dole's Record Solid on Judges</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<DD>I keep having people come to me asking the same question: "Give me one reason I should vote for Bob Dole for President," they ask. Okay, I'll give you a reason: The federal judiciary.
<DD>To date President Clinton has appointed 202 federal judges and 26% of the federal judiciary overall. His future appointments will even more dramatically shift the balance of the federal bench because the percentage of his activist appointees replacing more restrained Bush/Reagan appointees has steadily risen from 14% in 1993 to about 25% in 1995. That number will continue to rise because instead of activist Clinton judges replacing activist Carter judges, they will be replacing more restrained judges appointed by Presidents Reagan and Bush. Whatever you may think of George Bush, by the way, his federal judge appointments were overall slightly better than those of Ronald Reagan.
<DD>13 judges have already announced that they will take "senior status."  132 district court and 42 appeals court judges will be eligible to take senior status by the end of a second Clinton term. So Bill Clinton's appointees could comprise almost 60% of the federal judiciary and a majority of the U.S. Supreme Court if he has a second term in office.
<DD>Let me give you a few examples of the judges Bill Clinton has already managed to get on the court. Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, regarded as "moderates" by Clinton standards, voted against single sex education, voted to block a ban on quotas for homosexuals, voted to require discrimination against religious expression, voted to allow race preferences in government, voted to allow the creation of racially segregated congressional districts, voted to block the voters wishes to have federal term limits and have voted to empower the federal government to regulate virtually every aspect of the economic life of the country.
<DD>This is just a sample of the sort of people Clinton has put on the court. Judges Blaine Michael and Diana Motz voted against excluding homosexuals from the military. Judge Carlos Lucero voted to declare a city seal with a cross unconstitutional, Judge Theodore McKee voted to abolish student-led graduation prayers. Judge H. Lee Sarokin argued that prison inmates have a constitutional right to receive mail uninspected by prison officials. Judge Martha Daughtrey voted to throw out drug and child pornography evidence. Judge James Beaty voted to overturn a double murder conviction because a juror had driven past the house where the murder took place. And so it goes. I could go on and on but you get the picture.
<DD>The same goes for those Clinton appointees left hanging when the 104th Congress adjourned. Clarence Sundram supports the legalization of drugs. Margaret Morrow supports gun control and has an extensive record of feminist activism. Margaret McKeown helped to turn the American Bar Association toward its current pro-abortion position and was the lead counsel in homosexual rights litigation. William Fletcher believes there is a "discretionary Constitution" judges may use to legislate from the bench. And believe me it would only get worse in a second Clinton term.
<DD>But, you may protest, Bob Dole voted for most of those Clinton judges. True enough because Dole supports the right of a President to pick judges as he wishes. He expects the same treatment from the Senate if he gets the chance to pick judges. Nevertheless, an August 1996 report by the Judicial Selection Monitoring project of the Free Congress Foundation gave Dole a 100% score. The tally included votes on 20 closely-divided, controversial judicial and Justice Department nominations. Each of the nominations chosen for the report presented a genuine choice between judicial activism and restraint. On each vote, Bob Dole chose restraint.
<DD>Now does that guarantee that all of Bob Dole's judges will be judges we would approve of? No it does not. President Bush made a concerted effort to pick good judges and wound up with David Souter on the Supreme Court. But that is because he took the word of his then Chief of Staff John Sununu who insisted that Souter was a judicial conservative. The former right wing Governor of New Hampshire Meldrim Thompson agreed with Sununu and said he would stake his career on Souter being conservative. Both were wrong. 
<DD>I know from personal experience Bob Dole has always worked hard to confirm judges which the left fought hard against. Ask Dan Manion, approved by a single vote margin in the Senate for an appeals court seat. Ask Clarence Thomas, approved by only a four vote margin. Each prevailed despite overwhelming opposition from the Left, and thanks in no small part to Bob Dole.  Moreover Dole has proposed doing away with the role of the American Bar Association in the judicial selection process. The ABA is controlled by the liberals and has often shot down some of the better judicial nominees which Reagan and Bush sought to put forth.
<DD>Bob Dole has said that "the power of the courts to override the sovereign will of the people comes with a heavy responsibility, and must be used with the utmost restraint - without that restraint, judicial review becomes nothing less than judicial tyranny."
<DD>Over the next four years the president will likely decide several Supreme Court Justices and perhaps a third of all federal judges. I don't know about you, but I would rather trust someone who has Dole's philosophy than I would the current occupant of the White House to decide those appointments. Let's put it this way. We know what sort of federal judges Bill Clinton will give us. There is a fair chance that Bob Dole's picks will be a lot closer to what the founding fathers had in mind.

<h2>Schools Sending the Wrong Message</h2>
<P>
"Direct Line" Commentary<br>
By Special Columnist <b>Marianne Lombardi</b>
<P>
<br>
<DD>Lately it seems that America's schools are spending more time playing parent than teaching our kids how read, write, and spell. Schools all over the country are getting out of hand with their "It Takes A Village" mentality, confusing their role as educators with the role of parents, or acting fearful that one wrong move will bring on a lawsuit.
<P>Take for example the most recent news of Kimberly Smartt, the girl who was suspended for four months for taking a Midol tablet and giving one to a friend. The school claims that she violated the drug policy and is forcing her to pay for and undergo drug counseling. Kimberly, who is black, claims she is a victim of race discrimination and is suing the school superintendent, school principal and the county board of education. All of this over a drug that is as harmless as Tylenol and caffeine and a problem that could have been solved with one trip to the principal's office. What makes this situation more outrageous is that this very same girl could be given a condom or help in obtaining an abortion by the school without a blink of an eye.
<P>You may also remember the case in East Stroudsberg, Pennsylvania where 39 8th grade girls were given gynecological exams without their parents' consent. The school not only didn't think there was anything wrong with this, they actually argued that they were mandated by law to do it. No outrage on the part of the school there.
<P>And how about the schools around the country that are making it mandatory for students to volunteer as a requirement of graduation. Not just any volunteer work will do, it must be approved by the school and as you may have guessed, activities including religion or pro-life work is frowned upon or not allowed at all.
<P>What all of this means is that the liberal Department of Education and Hillary devotees are having an impact on our school system to the degree that education is now secondary. The schools know what's best for your child even if it defies common sense and violates your moral beliefs. Bob Dole articulated the first step in solving this problem the other night during the debate. When asked if he still supported abolishing the Department of Education, he said yes. What more needs to be said?

<h2>A Preview of a Union-Controlled Congress</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<DD>The U.S. Senate should have adjourned last night, but instead it is still in session because Senator Ted Kennedy and Senator Tom Harkin, two wholly-owned subsidiaries of organized labor, invoked arcane Senate rules to try to "exact one more pound of flesh for labor as we head out of here," as Majority Leader Trent Lott put it.
<DD>Kennedy and Harkin wanted a certain provision dropped from the bill which funds the FAA and other agencies. This provision would have corrected what is viewed as a mistake in legislation which passed the last Congress. That mistake had the effect of making it easier for unions to organize Federal Express. Senator Fritz Hollings, one of only few Democrats not owned by the labor unions, sponsored the rider which would correct the mistake and put Federal Express back on a level playing field with everyone else.
<DD>Kennedy and Harkin even caused the bill in question to be read to the Senate for hours on end. This hasn't happened in anyone's memory, but anything to please organized labor. Senator Harkin is up for re-election in Iowa and so confident of victory that he can afford to engage in such blatantly special-interest politics. By the way, 80% of Harkin's big war chest for his re-election comes from out of state, and most of that from the unions. No wonder he is doing their bidding. 
<DD>I mention this obscure moment in history because it is an illustration of things to come if the unions are successful in their quest for a change in who controls Congress. Already union bosses have a disproportionate influence over public policy way out of line for the number of people they now represent. There was a time, in the private sector, where unions had organized a third of the work force. In some states the unions were so strong that employers had to ask their permission before hiring anyone. Today union strength is at around 10% of the private sector work force and it is continuing to decline. Public sector unions are much stronger but even there big labor's grip has been loosened in some states with Republican Governors and legislatures.
<DD>The fact is that old fashioned unionism is out of step in our highly competitive society. The unions believe otherwise. Ask ValuJet. They began flying again yesterday after a three-month shutdown following the fatal crash in the Florida Everglades. While no one wants to cut corners on safety, the shutdown ordered by the FAA is unprecedented considering the type of crash. But ValuJet is non-union and the unions wanted the airline grounded. So, the FAA obliged, shutting down ValuJet even before investigators had determined the cause. Union lawyers are still in court trying to get an injunction to once again ground ValuJet. This argument is not about safety. ValuJet, with months of non-stop inspections and a good portion of its fleet not yet up and running, is probably the safest airline in the skies right now. This argument is about unions. If ValuJet can make a go of it with its highly attractive prices, the contracts the unions have negotiated with the other airlines come under great pressure. So it appears that the unions used their friends in the Clinton Administration to ground the airline. Unfair you say? Again, just a preview of coming attractions if the unions prevail.
<DD>And it does look promising for them. They are spending huge sums of money to defeat Republican freshmen and to win open seats. Republicans, who hoarded their money until these last weeks before the elections, are still not competitive. Meanwhile, the unions have pulled out all the stops, even to the point of deliberately violating federal election law, just so they can spend more money to buy the Congress. They don't care at this point. They are confident of winning.
<DD>Unions should have been out of business in the 104th Congress, yet they forced the issue of a minimum wage increase and the Republican Congress gave in. In fact anything objectionable to the labor unions was either killed in Congress, which didn't want the fight or was vetoed by President Clinton.
<DD>If the union bosses can get that much accomplished in the Republican 104th Congress, imagine what they can do with a Congress whose majority they have bought and paid for. This should be a hot issue in this election. But, alas, the union bosses have succeeded in intimidating the Republican majority who are now afraid to take the union bosses head on.
<DD>Go ahead. Tune into C-Span 2 and watch the union bosses at work through their surrogates Kennedy and Harkin and others. Then close your eyes and imagine the next session of Congress when these people could well be in the driver's seat. If that isn't enough to motivate you to get active in the electoral process, I don't know what will.

<h2>A Look Back at the 104th Congress</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<DD>The 104th Congress whimpered to an end, a mere farthing of its former self. This is the 15th Congress I've had the privilege of witnessing from start to finish. In the past three decades, only this Congress and the 97th Congress, which came in with Ronald Reagan, actually seemed poised to pass positive initiatives for the American people. Each passed one truly significant piece of legislation. In the 97th Congress it was the Reagan tax cuts. In this Congress it was welfare reform. Each of those Congresses did pass other positive legislation as well. The 104th Congress may well be remembered in the future for the line item veto, but if Bill Clinton is President the next four years, that is not likely to be a positive memory.
<DD>Each Congress is also noted for having lost its nerve along the way. In the 97th Congress, that meant passing TEFRA, which up to that point was the largest tax increase in history. For this Congress, it was throwing in the towel in the attempt to kill all sorts of undesirable government programs.
<DD>Expectations were unreasonably high for this Congress. But then the American people had just caused one of the largest Congressional turnovers in modern history. They wanted to be heard through their representatives. The first few months were exciting. The House of Representatives passed item after item in the Contract with America. But the U.S. Senate broke the back of that momentum when it failed to pass a Constitutional Amendment for a balanced budget. Even though that amendment would not have been ratified instantly by state legislatures, it would have provided a framework within which Congress would have most likely operated. When that battle was lost, Congress then tried to pass a balanced budget through legislation. But when Bill Clinton stopped that and it was back to business as usual for the remaining session.
Except for welfare, this Congress never came to grips with the rest of the entitlements. It never tackled the crippling national debt we shoulder. It left much of the important work to the next Congress.
<DD>The freshmen Republicans, who came to Washington so determined to make a difference, found that they were unable to move their more senior colleagues who were not impressed with the election results. Now, most of those freshmen are seriously threatened for re-election. The unions are spending up to $2 million per Congressional district to defeat them. This doesn't include what the environmental groups, radical lifestyle organizations and the Democratic party itself is spending. When you hear that Republicans have more money to spend in this election than the Democrats, don't you believe it.
<DD>Despite GOP Congressional Campaign Chairman Bill Paxon's brave words, a number of these freshmen won't be back. Unfortunately for those that do return, the lesson they may learn from this could be that you can't tackle the Washington establishment and win.
<DD>Sunday night on PBS, Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott debated would-be Speaker Dick Gephardt and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle. I say debated. It was more like a friendly argument over who had indeed spent the most money for education and school lunches and who could better protect Medicare.
<DD>All of the passion which brought the Republican Congress to power was gone. There seems to be far too little difference between the two political parties. The differences seemed profound only two years ago.
<DD>For the 105th Congress, the American people need to send to Washington another crop of freshmen similar to the ones they sent in 1994. That seems less likely, however. This election is not being fought over the issue of freedom. Even though it is true, no one has made the case that the future of the very Republic is at stake this time around. In 1994, Republicans painted the big picture of the threat of intrusive government promoting radical ideas. That big picture is almost entirely missing from this election.
What a pity that Republicans lost their nerve. The folk lore here is that the government shut down was an unmitigated disaster for Republicans. I disagree. They were on the road to winning the issue when they caved in and they haven't recovered from that mistake since. 
<DD>We can only hope that in local races for Congress, absent the overarching theme, there are candidates who still believe that tackling the crippling problems of America the Bankrupt are important. Maybe we just aren't hearing about them back here. I fervently hope so. America does not need a 105th Congress less committed to sanity and true reform than this one was.

<h3>September 26, 1996</h3>
<H2>Watergate All Over Again</H2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<P>
Richard Cohen of the Washington Post is an honest but doctrinaire liberal. There is hardly an issue where he and I don't disagree. Recently, however, he reversed himself on the partial birth abortion issue because, he said, he was misled by the pro-abortionists who had claimed  incorrectly  that it was a rarely-used procedure.
<p>
But Cohen can usually be counted on to boost the liberal end of the Democratic agenda. That is why it was startling to read his column in this morning's Post in which he suggests that we might be on the verge of reliving history. The sort of history Cohen has in mind is Watergate, 24 years ago. Then, as he correctly points out, Washington was consumed with the Watergate story but out in the countryside it didn't mean a thing. Richard Nixon was overwhelmingly re-elected. Then the nation had to come to grips with the Constitutional crisis that followed.
<p>
What troubles Cohen and should trouble all of us is the reaction of the White House in the face of the latest report by the office of Inspector General of Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Hillary Clinton was involved in an effort to deceive federal regulators into approving a sham real estate transaction, the report said. But the reaction of the White House is to attack those who have written the report. According to the Clinton White House, those who wrote the report were unduly pressured by Senator Al D'Amato, the Chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.
<p>
As to the other troubles visited on the Clintons, why, that is all the fault of the alleged partisan activities of Independent Prosecutor Kenneth Starr. Even Clinton himself has gone on the attack against Starr, echoing the complaint of Susan McDougal who says she'll rot in jail because Starr wants her to lie about the Clintons. Of course, this same Bill Clinton has hinted that he would not rule out a pardon for Susan McDougal and the others.
<p>
All of this has a familiar ring not just to Cohen but to the rest of us who were here in Washington at the time of Watergate. I cheered when then Republican National Chairman Senator Bob Dole told us that Watergate was just the product of the liberals being pushed by the left-wing Washington Post. "Tell it like it is, Bob," I thought as I watched Dole defend misdeeds at the White House. It turns out Dole had been lied to about the situation by Nixon and company so he was doing what he thought was right.
But the tactic is the same. When you can't explain your actions, blame someone else for asking the questions.
<p>
In the same paper in which Cohen's column appears there is a headline spread across page A-10 which reads "GOP Says White House Logs on Readers of FBI Reports have 6 Month Gap." Hmmm. Sound familiar? The 18 minute gap on a tape-recording just about sealed Richard Nixon's fate. But, of course, the Clinton White House blames their gap on a low-level aide named Mari Anderson, who just happens to be in hiding right now, unable to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Don't worry Mari. Congress is about to go out of session and then you can come out of hiding. After all, it's only five weeks until the elections and Bill Clinton's second term triumph. He'll take care of you and all the rest after that.
<p>
Yes, Cohen is exactly right. We have heard all of this before and it has an eerie ring to it. The fact is Richard Nixon's list of transgressions is minor compared with Bill Clinton's. If, in one narrative, you string together all of the problems this Administration has had, it is absolutely mind boggling. Yet the nation seems to care less. Things are going well. Unemployment is low. Inflation is stable. The stock market is high. We are all just fat, dumb and happy.
<p>
However, it is clear to Cohen and should be to the rest of the country that we may well be headed for the repeat of what happened in 1972: a Presidential re-election triumph and then a Constitutional crisis thereafter. No wonder the cartoon character Doonsbury, penned by the liberal but politically savvy Gary Trudeau, is preoccupied with Al Gore pretending to already be President. If this is indeed history repeating itself, then Gore ought to be President by 1998.
<p>
But wait a minute, folks. We are not the victims of some unstoppable historical forces. We have the power to make a difference. The clock hasn't stopped yet. We can still determine who wins in November. There is still time to wake up from the collective dream we Americans seem to be in to do something about this sorry mess before it is indeed too late.<p>

<h3>September 25, 1996</h3>
<H2>New Hope for the Senate</H2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<P>
As a follow up to a commentary of a couple of weeks ago, there is some good news to report. After we took on Senator Al D'Amato, the Chairman of the GOP Senatorial Campaign Committee, over the matter of his lack of support for Woody Jenkins, the endorsed GOP candidate in Louisiana, things began to happen.
<P>
Picking up that theme, Columnist Bob Novak wrote a column quoting this commentary and his piece ran in the New York Post. D'Amato got the message. Realizing that if the Louisiana general election ended up with two Democrats facing each other he would have it hung around his neck, D'Amato swung into action. The Senatorial committee began to poll to see which of the six GOP candidates had a chance to be in the runoff. They found, to their utter surprise, that Woody Jenkins was that candidate. Jenkins had built up a significant organization to the point where he scored in lower double digits even though most of his opponents had spent millions of dollars on television which Jenkins didn't have to spend.
<P>
Based on that data, D'Amato first tried to get other candidates to withdraw from the race. They would not do so. So, D'Amato got together with other GOP leaders in the state and one by one they agreed to support the candidate so that in the last week before the election, each day a different prominent Republican endorsed Jenkins. Four days before last Saturday's election, D'Amato then wired the Jenkins campaign about half of the money they could have given under the law so that Jenkins could, at the end, have lots of television and radio commercials. All of this created a surge effect. When the ballots were counted, Jenkins was not only in the runoff, he placed first among all the candidates. As a result, Republican Woody Jenkins will face Democrat Mary Landrieu, the daughter of the former mayor of New Orleans.
<P>
D'Amato called me to assure me that what happened was all part of the plan from the beginning. His own staffers assure me that it was not. But in any case, what happened worked. Now Republicans have a better than 50-50 shot at taking the Senate seat. In the primary, all the Republican candidates combined got about 58% of the vote. The Democratic candidates got 42% of the votes. Landrieu is on the far left of the Democratic party, although she is now trying to run as a moderate. Jenkins is the most solid conservative running for the U.S. Senate in the country. He is not backing away from his views at all. So we have a classic philosophical contest. Of course, the turnout in November will be far higher and right now Bill Clinton has a huge lead in Louisiana, but still Jenkins can be considered the slight favorite. 
<P>
What happened in Louisiana mirrors what has happened in just about all the states except in the East. Conservatives have been nominated for the U.S. Senate. Except for Maine, Massachusetts and Rhode Island, the Republican nominees are good on the issues. 
<P>
The liberal mantra is that conservatives can win primaries but they will all be defeated in the general election. Some no doubt will. But some will also likely be elected. Al Salvi is running an outstanding campaign against Congressman Dick Durbin in Illinois. He is behind, but he showed in his primary that he knows how to come from behind to win. Sam Brownback in Kansas is an excellent campaigner. He is slightly ahead in his contest with Jill Docking. In Alabama, Attorney General Jeff Sessions is slightly ahead. Congressman Tim Hutchinson has a shot at winning the Senate seat in Arkansas despite Bill Clinton's being at the top of the ticket. In Colorado, Congressman Wayne Allard is even in the polls with lawyer/lobbyist Tom Strickland. And so it goes. I don't have time to mention all of the races at this point. 
<P>
But the point is this. Unless the Republicans are completely destroyed by a Democratic surge at the end of the election, similar to what happened with the Republicans in 1994, the Senate should be an improved body after November.
<P>
That is good news for those of us who have been so frustrated by the Senate's resistance to constructive measures passed by the House.
<P>
Oh, and by the way. If it is clear that Bill Clinton is going to be re-elected, the Wall Street Journal poll reports that by a margin of 53% to 39%, voters want a Republican Congress to keep Clinton in check, rather than a Democratic Congress which can enact more of Bill Clinton's agenda.
<P>
The fact is there is some hope after all in this otherwise dismal political season.

September 24, 1996
</h3>
<h2>VMI Decision Tragic for the Nation</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
A tragedy occurred in the State of Virginia over the weekend for which the whole nation will pay. By a one-vote margin, the Board of Visitors of the Virginia Military Institute voted to end its 157 years as an all-male academy. Beginning with the 1997 school term, VMI will admit women.
<P>
By the same 9 - 8 vote, the Board also rejected a plan to take the school private - a move by which the Board could have avoided a court order requiring the admittance of women.
<P>
The action against VMI began in the Bush Administration. The State of Virginia fought against it. But earlier this year, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that state-supported all-male schools are unconstitutional. Never mind that the State of Virginia has opened a military academy just for women so that women who desired a military education could have an equal chance to do so under the law. No, that wasn't good enough for the fanatical Supreme Court, the majority of whose Justices deserve to be impeached for undermining the Constitution.
<P>
Nevertheless, the Virginia Board of Visitors could have maintained VMI's all-male status by voting to take VMI private, thereby placing the school out of the reach of the court ruling. But, the Board voted not to. What was tragic about that narrow decision is that it was dictated not by what is right for the country whose military VMI serves, not by what was best for the students attending VMI, not by the wishes of the alumni who were prepared to raise the money to buy the school, but by the liberal media and its accomplices in the political community.
<P>
Virginia's Republican Governor, George Allen, who had originally supported VMI in its court case, changed his position, a few days before the Board of Visitors meeting. Allen got a case of political correctness and declared VMI should not go private because the media would make it into a pariah institution. That statement was enough to tip the balance in favor of admitting women. Several of Governor Allen's appointees to the Board of Visitors voted to reject the motion to take the school private.
<P>
Thanks, Governor Allen, the supposed conservative Republican with national ambitions. We'll remember this whenever you seek whatever office it is you want after leaving the Governorship next year.
<P>
I well recall the words of Dr. Ben Alexander, the former President of The University of the District of Columbia. He courageously tried to get rid of the politician imposed students who were not there to learn but just to get a worthless degree. Dr. Alexander wanted to place standards on UDC. He was doing exactly the right thing. Many of us tried to help him. But he resigned. Afterward, I asked him why he resigned when it was the right fight at the right time. He said because he was told that if he continued to fight the Washington Post would ruin him. "If I had NET back then, I might well have stayed to fight," Dr. Alexander said. But this was in the early 80's before there were many alternative means of communications.
<P>
Ben Alexander at least had an excuse. What is the excuse of the majority on the VMI Board? That their Governor considers them an embarrassment? That they would be attacked by the national media? Just when are we going to get some people in this country who will say "I don't care if we get attacked. This is the right thing to do. We are going forward." I will tell you there would be an emotional outpouring of support that would amaze and overwhelm the politicians. 
<P>
But no, the majority on the VMI Board had to listen to the state's chief politician who just didn't want the fight, lest it damage his plans for national office. Well, Governor Allen has likely brought VMI to the end of the line as a viable institution. "Without a distinctive, attractive educational niche, VMI, a small school with limited offerings in close proximity to three major state universities, will lose its ability to compete for students," Anita Blair, a VMI trustee who voted in favor of taking the school private, said after the vote. "A coed VMI soon will become indistinguishable from the existing cadet programs at Virginia Tech and elsewhere." She is absolutely right. And who will suffer in the process? The U.S. military which has used VMI to train officers now for over a Century and a half.
<P>
Isn't it time that the American public and the politicians asked themselves why it is that the media should be able to dictate what private citizens want to do? The pseudo macho majority on the VMI Board said they aren't going to change a thing at VMI when it admits women. Right. They claim that the tradition of treating freshmen cadets as rats, with shaved heads, will continue. It will never happen. But even if it did I would be against it. Women, even if they desire this kind of punishment, should not be treated this way and as the Citadel has proven, at the end of the day, they won't be.
<P>
It is all part of the effort to pretend that men and women are all the same. It is the same sort of pretend world that the Soviets invented with their concept of the "new man." It defies reality. But this sort of fiction is permitted to continue because politicians such as Governor Allen refuse to stand up and fight for what is right.
<P>
It is no wonder that Robert Bork was motivated to write his new book "Slouching Toward Gomorra." The culture is collapsing, not just because forces of evil such as elements of the media are pushing it in that direction, but because in public life there are no real men left who are willing to stand up and say "enough is enough."
<P>

<h2>A Gap Bigger Than Gender</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
Kellyanne Fitzpatrick of the Polling Company provided us with data on a survey taken from September 5th through the 12th on who will control the Congress. Her conclusion is that whatever happens in the Presidential race, Congress is going to remain in Republican hands. That conclusion is verified by several other recent polls which show the Republicans even or with a slight edge. The Polling Company finds Democrats with a one point edge, but traditionally Republicans perform better than the so-called generic ballot-test for Congress.<P>
We hear a great deal about the gender gap and indeed Kellyanne does find such a gap. But her research finds the gender gap at 8 points and not the 20 plus points which the so called mainstream media keeps touting. Kellyanne is the one, genuinely culturally-conservative pollster in the business and I trust her results. Meanwhile, Republicans hold a three-point advantage with Generation X voters (from 18 to 29 years of age) and a two-point advantage with Baby Boomers. But Republicans are down two points with so called pre-retirees (thats my age group) and down five points among seniors. Thats not surprising considering the amount of propaganda put forth by the unions and liberals on Medicare and Social Security.<P>
Now come the kickers. Here are the real gaps in American politics. Singles favor the Democrats for Congress by six percentage points. Those who are married but without children favor the Democrats by eight percentage points. But those married with children favor the Republicans by a whopping 10 percentage points!<P>
I mentioned this to Kellyanne at a dinner last night and she said, "Yes, Its the three Ms." Three Ms? What are the three Ms? "Marriage, Mortgage and Munchkins," she replied. If you want your children to vote for conservatives for Congress, not only do they need to be married, they also need to have children, Miss Fitzpatrick said. So the gap between those who are married and have children and those who are married without children is greater than the gap between men and women. Apparently, there is nothing like a few responsibilities to make voters understand who favors policies in their best interests.<P>
But lets talk about the truly gigantic gap in American politics. Yes, there is a gap bigger than either gender or marriage. Among those who dont listen to talk radio at all, the Democrats hold a nine-point advantage in the race for Congress. Among those who listen to talk radio five hours or more a week, the Republicans hold an incredible 16-point margin. Among those who listen to talk radio only one to four hours a week, the margin for the Republicans is just three points.<P>
So now things are clearing up nicely. If we care what kind of Congress we have, we must see to it that the young people we know get married and have children quickly. We must introduce talk radio to these young families immediately. I dont have the figures for those who are married, have children and listen to talk radio, but the gap must be gargantuan.<P>
Mrs. Weyrich and I are about to become grandparents for the first time. My wife has all sorts of plans to get a cradle for the baby and car seats for each of the cars, and heaven knows what else. Well all of that is fine. But as for me, Im buying this new little family several radios, each tuned to the best talk shows in the business. Hey, I care about my future!<P>

Yesterday I attended part of a two day conference called " A Dialogue on race" at Towson State University in Baltimore. The conference was sponsored by a group called "Search for Common Ground" which promotes dialogues between opposing groups worldwide. They are active in Northern Ireland and Bosnia and have set up a dialogue between pro life and pro choice groups here in the United States.<p>

I stayed for only part of the conference because once my friend Lawry Chickering, the President of the Institute for Contemporary Studies in California, for whom I have great respect, persuaded me to go, we had a next to impossible time finding out the schedule of the event and meanwhile I got committed to other things. <p>

But I was present for the entire session which dealt with the barriers to racial progress. The group consisted of about half whites and half blacks. There were no Hispanics and only one Asian American present. Four of us were conservative philosophically. The rest ranged from left to far left. <p>

What struck me about the whole exercise was the fixation most of the blacks and many of the whites had on the past. The outstanding editor of the Heritage Foundation's magazine Policy Review, Adam Meyerson, tried to introduce the notion that many blacks represent the American dream. They have overcome slavery and segregation and have gone on to become prosperous and successful and have made important contributions to the society in which we live. Meyerson suggested that it would be well to study those examples as role models since they had, in fact, achieved the progress the others were seeking. <p>

That did not go over very well in this room filled with professionals, many of whom make their living working on the issue of racial conflict. After all, if we solved racial problems, some of these folks would be out of work. 
We were told that unless we could identify with and experience the pain suffered by blacks because of slavery, segregation and racism, we could never  make any progress. <p>

I began to think about that. The Treaty of Versailles, which imposed impossible demands on Germany after World War One, caused my family terrible trouble. They had never been wealthy. But what little they had was wiped out. They became poverty stricken and unable to support themselves financially. For such a reason did my father become the first in his family, at age l9, to journey to America in l923 to seek a decent living.<p>

All my life I have heard stories about that era and the pain it caused. I can acknowledge, and have done so, that the Versailles Treaty was unwise and unjust. But should I go around and insist that everyone else comprehend the damage done to my family because of that injustice? Granted, those conditions lasted a much shorter time than did slavery and segregation. But the principle is the same. <p>

I want to know about that era because I want to understand why my family on my father's side came here. I want to understand what happened in case world leaders ever again try to humiliate a nation the way France insisted on humiliating Germany back then. We know the consequences of that action. The Versailles Treaty created the conditions which made Adolph Hitler possible. <p>

But I did not remain dead in the water because of that injustice. Nor do I insist on discussing it constantly. 
Now I was told at that conference that, of course, my family could make progress because we were white. Oh, really? Does anyone remember what it was like being a German in-between the two World Wars? You were suspect. You were discriminated against. Laws were passed to prevent German language newspapers from being printed. A law in Wisconsin even stopped the sermons in German at the local parish church and the church bulletin had to be printed half in English and half in German. It was not a fun era. It was overcome by perseverance, discipline and hard work. <p>

Even though my family came from Germany and Norway, long after slavery had been instituted here, I am perfectly willing to acknowledge that this did great injustice to black people. I am perfectly willing to stipulate that segregation laws were unjust and that blacks got the short end of the stick for many years. <p>

But I am not willing to try to go through some exercise where I am expected to identify with the pain black people suffered back then any more than I should expect them to understand the pain my family suffered because of the unjust Versailles Treaty. These things happened. One participant did acknowledge that it was liberating for him to have learned that in history blacks sometimes oppressed other blacks and that whites sometimes enslaved other whites because he had been brought up with the notion that only whites had enslaved blacks.  True enough. Some of the blacks who came to the United States were sold to their white slave owners by other blacks. <p>

History is good to know and to understand, but it is not healthy or, productive to try to constantly relive that history. That is what prevents progress in Northern Ireland and Bosnia and elsewhere. Yes, we must acknowledge and ask God's forgiveness for injustices. But the main thing is that we work to be sure there is a level playing field because, as Meyerson has pointed out, many who have used that level playing field have made great progress.<p>
 
As for me, I don't need a conference to tell me what needs to be done. All I have to do is to take my Christian faith seriously. Many blacks are very religious people. I have more in common with them than I have with secular non believing whites. We can all move forward because of shared beliefs. Christianity is nothing if it is not a religion of forgiveness. In that context, and with the acknowledgment of past injustices, we have the framework for real progress. <p>

No, we should never forget the past. Nor should we try to relive the past. God put us here and now in this time and in this age. For that we should be grateful. We might start by thanking God for the privilege of living here. Having visited more than 50 nations in the world, I can affirm that it is a privilege even for the poorest of the poor.  Perhaps then, with a sense of gratitude, we can move to overcome artificial barriers to progress, some of which are constructed by the very people whose job is supposed to be to tear them down.

<h2>Absent Shame, Morris Profits</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>




<P>In the latest chapter involving former Presidential advisor Dick Morris, it now seems that he is about to become a TV talk show host and will be paid a huge talent fee for doing so.
This comes after his $2 million deal with a publisher in which Morris has agreed to write a book about his exciting year and a half with Bill Clinton.<P>
The more sordid the details which emerge about this whole affair, the greater the profit for Dick Morris. And that says all you need to know about the wretched state of things in contemporary America.
When the story first broke about Morris during the Democratic convention and he was forced to resign, who was it that called him from their campaign bus to offer sympathy? Why President Bill Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. As one observer noted, it was as if Morris had been injured in a car accident. Not since that day has Bill Clinton or the prematurely canonized Al Gore ever said a single word to the effect that they disapprove of what Dick Morris did. We know Clinton and Gore think it is terrible that the prostitute was disloyal. We know they think it is terrible that the rest of the media published her tabloid account. What the American people have not heard from the President and Vice President are words to the effect that "we are sickened by what has been done here and we think Dick Morris should be ashamed of himself."<P>
No, indeed. In the past, political figures who had done far less were sent into exile for years. But Morris didn't have to endure even a day of shame for what happened. Not even from his wife. I am all for forgiveness and I don't like to see any marriage break up for any reason. My initial reaction when I heard the Morris story was to extend sympathy to Mrs. Morris whom I regarded as the real victim. But I should not have bothered. She didn't need my sympathy. She was too busy posing for the front cover of Time Magazine. By that gesture not only did she tell her husband that such behavior was acceptable, but by implication she was critical of any other wife who would have suffered extreme humiliation over what happened. She said she didn't want the details because she is an adult. How positively noble. She even quoted scripture saying that "let he who is without sin cast the first stone". It is comforting to know, I suppose, that anything from the scriptures has penetrated the consciousness of those two. <P>
Far from suffering, Dick Morris is actually better off financially from what happened than if he had simply stayed in the background and had continued to advise Clinton all the way to the election. No doubt, if Clinton is re-elected, there will be a line of future candidates at Morris' door just waiting to sign him up for all his brilliance. In fact, now even if Clinton loses, Dick Morris won't suffer. He can claim it is because he was forced to resign.<P>
It isn't just that all of this has happened that is so bad. It is the deafening silence about it from the rest of the political community. Granted Bob Dole is not in a position to say much about this, but what of the rest of his party? In their bid to show extreme tolerance, the Republicans have contributed to this dreadful situation by failing to proclaim that what Morris did is just plain wrong. The most we heard from the Republican camp was a bit of chortling because the incident caused Bill Clinton problems. That even stopped abruptly when the media pointed out that Morris had worked for Trent Lott and Jesse Helms among others. <P>
In the Old Testament God sent a plague of snakes to bite the Israelites just because they complained that they were sick of  eating the Manna from Heaven which the Lord had provided. God punished their audacity.<P>
What will it take to punish ours?<P> 
It is true that all through the history of humanity, from the Garden of Eden on, God's laws have been broken by mankind . But I guess one would have to go back to Sodom and Gomorra to find a time when people flaunted their immorality as much as they do today. Of course, God destroyed those cities.
Must we tempt God to do the same here by completely destroying the sense of shame in this nation?<P>

<h2>Conventions Losing Their Convention</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>

<P>

<P>

<P>A few parting thoughts about the Republican convention in San Diego.<P>
First, we will never know if my VP prediction would have come true. I had Bob Dole picking Gov. George Voinovich of Ohio as his running mate, but Voinovich took himself out of the running before the convention ever started. He told me privately that "no one with a last name like mine would ever get selected as a nominee of this party," a reference to his Eastern European roots. Be that as it may, Voinovich was a Catholic from a large Midwestern industrial state and might have helped Dole there. But I admit that Dole got a great deal more from his actual choice. Jack Kemp has fused the Dole campaign and Dole himself with energy and that is something that Voinovich would not have done as well. Moreover, Kemp is able to communicate with lots of voters Dole had virtually no chance of getting. To the extent that Vice Presidential picks ever help their Presidential nominees, this one certainly did and Dole has to be given an A for imagination and surprise on his choice.<P>
The convention itself was another matter. Having participated in one way or another in eight other Republican conventions since 1960, this was not, by any stretch of the imagination, a real convention. It was a four-day glorified infomercial. To be fair, the Democrats started that trend with the convention they produced in 1992 which bore little relationship to the delegates in attendance but was calculated to recast Bill Clinton as a New Democrat. They succeeded and Republicans got the picture.<P>
The delegates themselves had nothing to say about this convention. Every word, every image, even the demonstrations were scripted. To be sure there was a certain amount of scripting which occurred at every convention in the modern era. But the control of this convention was breathtaking. Members of the Politburo would have been proud. Next week we will have the Democratic version of the same scripted orchestration.<P>
The institution of the political convention cannot endure this level of contrivance for very long. Delegates who go to the trouble of getting themselves elected, based on representing grassroots networks of followers, are simply not going to tolerate paying all of that money to become a delegate only to be told they count for nothing and can't even cast the vote for which they were elected in the first place.
No, what we witnessed in San Diego and what we will witness in Chicago is not a political convention. I've been to enough of them to know the difference. What we witnessed was a grand scale TV production, in the case of San Diego, run by Mike Deaver, the Ronald Reagan image maker who later went to federal prison for improper lobbying. The irony is that most people did not watch this television spectacular. The Democrats are now worried that even fewer people will watch theirs. Except for the question of how Hillary's speech will match Elizabeth Dole's, there is really nothing interesting likely to take place there. So for all of their efforts to put on a good TV show, and it was that, the convention handlers did not achieve what a real convention, with some drama, conflict and good old fashioned political battles would have done. It did not produce an audience.<P>
With major media outlets already saying enough is enough, the era of this sort of political convention is about over. For my money good riddance. If the price of a party getting its message out is to deprive the delegates of their freedom to act as delegates, then this kind of convention is not worth having. Haley Barbour, Republican National Chairman, is busy congratulating himself on a flawless convention. I hope he has fond memories. It will probably be the last of its kind.<P>
Thanks to the many of you who called us, wrote us, E-mailed us or faxed us on our convention coverage. Our crew in San Diego, led by Peter Estrada and Greg Jenkins, worked incredibly hard. They drove themselves to the point of exhaustion. While others were out partying, the NET crew was still working. We had to. We did with less than 20 people what the major networks did with 500. We appreciate many of you saying that our coverage was better than theirs.<P>
As to Bill Lind's commentaries which some of you disliked, I asked Bill to write about this convention the way that the late H.L. Menken wrote about politics in the earlier part of this Century from his headquarters at the Baltimore Sun. Lind did just that, and he made some people angry in the process. Well stay tuned. He is going to write about the Democratic convention as well.<P>

<h2>Republicans Can Count on Whitewater</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>

<P>

<P>
Some Republicans have been smug all along  since the l994 elections, believing that they were destined to win the Presidency and keep the Congress. Even as even their own polls show Bill Clinton way out front, the smugness in these same Republican circles had continued. The reason? The belief that that somehow Whitewater or some related Clinton scandal was going to bail them out. <p>

Well, look again, Republicans. A jury in Arkansas has acquitted two Arkansas bankers on four charges of fraud in connection with the l990 Clinton gubernatorial campaign and it has deadlocked on seven others.<p>

 That trial had the most promise of directly linking Bill Clinton to wrong doing. It failed. Moreover, Whitewater Special Counsel Ken Starr has indicated that he does not believe that his investigation should interfere in the political process. What that means is if Starr did have plans to indict Hillary Clinton, and there are solid reasons to believe he did, such an indictment will wait until after the l996 elections. Starr well remembers Lawrence Walch's political inspired indictment of former defense Secretary Cap Weinberger on the eve of the l992 election and he was bitterly critical of it. He does not intend to follow that model.  <p>

So now here are the Republicans. 90 days away from the general elections and their silver bullet theory has gone out the window. Moreover Bill Clinton has done an excellent job of running to the center politically. It is hard for the electorate to distinguish Clinton's positions from Bob Dole's positions.<p>
 
What that means is that if they have any chance to win, the Republicans are going to have to come up with some real barn burner issues. These must be issues that excite the electorate. These must be issues which indicate that there is a clear cut difference between the candidates. These have to be issues which would force Bill Clinton to abandon his own base and risk losing the Presidency if he chose to echo the Republican position as he has thus far done with most of the issues Dole has weakly raised .<p>

That is a tall order for any Presidential candidate. It is an especially tall order for candidate Dole, who has made a point of running as fast to the center from the right as Clinton has run to the center from the left. It is little wonder that a poll issued late last week indicated that there is almost no interest in this year's Presidential contest, with only 20% of the electorate feeling strongly about re-electing Bill Clinton and a mere 11% of the electorate feeling strongly about electing Dole President.<p>

Miracles do happen. The Olympics demonstrated that very well. But usually they happen to people who have been working hard to prepare to take advantage of the moment. Unfortunately for Dole and the Republicans, that doesn't seem to fit the description of their candidate. With Whitewater all but gone from the political scene, Dole and the Republicans will need a sharply defined message to take to the electorate and that is something which is strangely missing from this year's political process. 

<P>

July 31, 1996
</h3>
<h2>Congressman Gunderson's Allegations</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>

<P>
A point of personal privilege. Congressman Steve Gunderson of Wisconsin yesterday held a press conference which attacked me personally. Here is the background. Last year Gunderson, who has served in office in the 3rd Congressional District from Wisconsin since l980, announced that he would not seek another term in Congress. <p>

Subsequent to that time, Congressman Pat Roberts, who has been Chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, decided to run for the U.S. Senate for the seat now held by Nancy Kassebaum. The man in line to succeed Roberts as Chairman of the Agriculture Committee, Bill Emerson, died. Thus Gunderson, who was next in line, began to change his mind. He asked the Republican candidate for Congress Jim Harsdorf to step aside. He declined to do so. Notwithstanding that Gunderson, one of the openly homosexual Members of Congress, encouraged a write in candidacy on his own behalf. Yesterday he announced that he was pulling the plug on that effort and that he would not be a candidate for re-election after all.<p>

In the process of making that announcement, Gunderson said the following: "It has come to my attention that conservative social groups in this country, led by Paul Weyrich, have informed the Speaker they would initiate a major independent expenditure against me. I have been informed that these people were prepared to do whatever was necessary to not only defeat me, but destroy me. I have been informed these groups were going to make allegations regarding my health status and AIDS. I have been informed that they were going to engage in other elements of character assassination....... Ladies and gentlemen, the reality is that to some people in this country, the possibility of someone who is openly gay assuming the chair of a major Committee in Congress somehow legitimizes their personal life. And sadly, they could not accept that. "<p>
 
Gunderson said he had been assured by Speaker Gingrich that he would support Gunderson all the way if he chose to do the write in. This is the same Speaker Gingrich who is punishing Congressmen Smith and Dornan for standing on principle. <p>

Now let me make this clear. I wish I could take credit for driving Steve Gunderson out of the race. His lifestyle is his own business, and I have not sought to make it an issue. He did. He openly flaunted his lover at Congressional functions. His partner, whose name is Rob, even enjoyed a spousal pass in Congress which meant he had a special parking place and get into otherwise restricted areas. <P>

But I opposed Gunderson because of what he believed in. He was one of these so called "moderates" who was nearly always working at cross purposes with those of us who believe in traditional values.<p>
 
The fact is , however, that Gunderson made up this charge about an independent expenditure against him. I have made no such move. I have never discussed such an idea with anyone. Anyone who knows me knows that I deal with issues. Lifestyles only become important when the high nature of the office demands it (for example, a President who was on drugs could not perform his duties appropriately) or when the person himself makes it an issue by his or her conduct. <p>

Speaker Gingrich would not possibly have known about such an independent expenditure because I have not spoken to the Speaker or his staff or any other Member of the leadership or their staffs or anyone else for that matter about such a campaign. <p>

The fact is, and he admits it in his own statement, that leading Republicans in his own state were adamantly opposed to his running. I had nothing whatsoever to do with that. I never spoke with any of them. Gunderson, despite the poll he released which claims that the people were clamoring for him to run, was afraid he would lose. In Washington, the game these days is to blame someone else for your decisions. I guess for Gunderson, I was a convenient target.<p>

As difficult as it is for anyone who is considered a public figure to win a libel or slander suit these days, I have my attorneys looking into the matter. As happy as I am to see him leave the Congress, Steve Gunderson should not be permitted to make things up about me or anyone else. He should not be permitted to sully my good name.<p>
 
Gunderson said that "ugliness has become the rule, rather than the exception in modern day campaigns." If that is true, then what Gunderson did is one of the worst examples of ugliness I have ever seen in the electoral process. He is truly a pathetic public figure. All of us should pray for him.<P>

<h2>Clinton and Terrorism</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<P>
It is an all too familiar sound. President Clinton, in a broadcast to the nation, offers
                      sympathy to the families of the victims of terrorism. Then he insists that no stone
                      will be left unturned to track down and punish those responsible. 
<P>
                      Those words, used over and over again recently after the blast in Saudi Arabia,
                      after TWA's Flight 800 and after the Olympic pipe bomb incident, just to name a
                      few in the past weeks, may comfort the nation. But the deeds of the Clinton
                      Administration are another matter. 
<P>
                      One of the nation's leading experts on terrorism told me privately the other day that
                      this Administration has resisted doing what is absolutely necessary if we are
                      actually serious about tracking down those responsible, and if we truly want to
                      prevent future incidents of terrorism. The Administration doesn't want to use human
                      agents to infiltrate suspected terrorist groups. 
<P>
                      "The problem with the Clinton Administration", this expert in terrorism told me, "is
                      that they think you can track down everything by satellite and other electronic
                      means. But in combating terrorism, there is no substitute for having real live bodies
                      on the scene. That's how you really get the job done". 
<P>
                      It is ironic too because after Oklahoma City, when it was clear that the suspects
                      were domestic anarchists, the Administration was only too willing to engage in
                      spying. The Republican Congress finally stripped most of those powers from the
                      legislation which Bill Clinton submitted to Congress. 
<P>
                      But when it comes to the international variety, the Administration, trapped by its
                      own l960's view of the world, rejects escalated spying. 
<P>
                      That is, in fact, typical of the attitude of the far left, which formed its attitudes about
                      spying in the depth of the cold war. Somehow, for the far left, it was acceptable for
                      the Soviets to have their agents everywhere in the United States. But it was
                      impermissible for the United States to spy on Soviet activities. The left has never
                      been shy about double standards. 
<P>
                      President Clinton is one of the most able Presidents we have ever employed when
                      it comes to sympathizing with the victims of terrorism. The relatives of those killed
                      in TWA Flight 800 sang the praises of Clinton as he spent several hours with them
                      last week. His efforts in that regard are commendable.
<P>
                      But the one effective thing Clinton could do for those relatives-- to track down
                      those who were responsible for the tragedy itself by the most effective means
                      possible, the President is reluctant to do.

<h2>Sacrificing Conscience to Republican Totalitarianism</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p><p>

In two nations which were part of the NATO alliance, conservative political parties which were at one time dominant forces in those countries, have all but disappeared. In Canada, the Progressive Conservatives went from a solid outright majority in the Parliament to just two seats following the last Canadian election. In Italy, the Christian Democrats, long the party of the Roman Catholic Church, and nearly always the central partner in Italy's many post-war governments, has nearly vanished following recent elections there.
<p.
In the United States, the Republican party may be next. This week the party took another giant step in that direction. House Speaker Newt Gingrich inflicted ex post facto discipline on Reps. Bob Dornan (R-CA) and Chris Smith (R-NJ) for supporting former Congressman Joe DioGuardi in his primary race against the militantly pro-abortionist Rep. Sue Kelly (R-NJ). Dornan and Smith were forbidden to serve on key conference committees which are bringing forth crucial bills to be passed before this Congress becomes history. Moreover, both Congressmen have been denied travel funds even though both are chairmen of international subcommittees where travel is required as part of the responsibilities of the committee.
For Rep. Smith especially, opposing Kelly was an exercise of his conscience. Rep. Kelly is one of five Republicans to vote with Bill Clinton on the partial birth abortion issue. Catholic Cardinal John O'Connor of New York has called the brutal murder of the baby in the partial birth abortion procedure infanticide. Mr. DioGuardi is in the race because of that issue.
<p>
Rep. Smith has introduced a freedom of conscience resolution in the House Republican Conference. It declares that any Member of Congress shall have the right to back any candidate for office according to his own conscience. Moreover, if sanctions were to be imposed on a Member for doing so, the resolution would require a vote on the issue by the entire House GOP Conference.
<p>
Smith needs 50 signatures on his resolution to have it considered. He is having trouble getting the signatures because Speaker Gingrich has so intimidated Members with his disciplinary measures that many who are sympathetic to Smith are now afraid to sign up.
<p>
The fact is there was no rule in the GOP Conference against a Member supporting a primary opponent of a sitting congressman. In a display of Soviet style justice, the sanctions were imposed after the fact.
If we have come to the point where, because he serves as a Republican Member of the House, a Member of Congress can no longer follow his conscience (and anyone who knows Smith knows that he is genuinely a man of conscience), then we have changed our form of government overnight without the consent of the governed. If these sanctions are allowed to stand, the Republican party, in due course, will surely follow the way of the Canadian Conservatives and the Italian Christian Democrats.
<p>
If to be a Republican means one has to give up his freedom of conscience, then the price, as Rep. Mark Neumann (R-WI) has suggested, is much too high.

<h2>Casino Gambling Reform Hits Roadblock</h2>
<p><p><p>
<blockquote>
When both sides of a highly contentious issue claim they are satisfied with the result of a compromise, it is a sure sign that very little will be accomplished. That is exactly the case with a bill, for which the House of Representatives gave final approval, which would create a federal commission to examine the $40 billion gambling industry.
<p>
That any bill was passed at all was due to a rare combination of the religious right, who believe that gambling has hurt families, and liberals who target the gambling industry as another example of the corruption of free enterprise. 
<p>
The original bill, as conceived by Congressman Frank Wolf, an evangelical Christian from Virginia, was greatly weakened. 
<p>
Originally the commission would have had broad subpoena power. But the bill which passed the Congress, now permits the commission to only subpoena documents, not people. In addition, if material is not available from public sources, the Commission must keep its information confidential. Wolf said he is satisfied with the powers the commission has. But so is Frank Fahrenkopf, the former Republican National Chairman, who represents the gambling industry in Washington. He says he welcomes a "balanced" inquiry into the industry. 
<p>
What all of this means is that Congressman Wolf got just enough out of the commission that he doesn't have to deny that his bill was gutted, while Fahrenkopf is satisfied that the commission doesn't really have enough power to do any real damage to the industry. So there you have it. Another "Washington Commission" has been born. It will spend lots of taxpayer money. It will issue reports. Most likely few will read the reports. Nothing will change. 
<p>
Congressman Henry Hyde, the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said the commission was needed to know the implications of the growth of the gambling industry. A couple of decades ago there was legalized gambling in only two states, Nevada and New Jersey. Now only two states, Utah and Hawaii, ban legalized gambling, and there are operating casinos in 23 states. 
<p>
The Family Research Council points out that in states where gambling is flourishing, more and more families are becoming impoverished. They contend that gambling is addictive in many cases and has led to financial ruin for many families who otherwise would be able to maintain themselves. The gambling industry, on the other hand, contends that only 5% of gamblers are addicted. And so the debate goes on and on. 
<p>
It is really a part of an age old debate about what sorts of activity, which if done in excess can lead to the destruction of human beings, should thus be legal and open for all citizens to participate. Such a debate preceded the passage of the Volstead Act, the Constitutional amendment which outlawed the sale of liquor and was in force for more than a decade. Enforcement of the Volstead Act, critics claim, was responsible for the establishment of the Mafia in the United States, as liquor sales went underground. The same question now pertains to gambling. Should it be open and above board where it can be seen and regulated? Or is society better off if gambling is underground, even if authorities have a much harder time policing it?
The new Gambling Commission may provide some data, but it is unlikely to resolve the issue. The real question, as it is with pornography on the Internet or drug usage and other such matters, is simply this: what damage is caused to society when potentially sinful activities are engaged in by a substantial percentage of its population? And if it can be proven that substantial damage is done by such activities to society as a whole, what right does society have to curb the choices which can be made by free citizens?
Libertarians contend that citizens should be free to do as they wish, because it is a matter of their choice to use their resources as they see fit. Traditionalists contend that society must protect itself against any behavior which is seen as self destructive and should therefore be free to curb such behavior. Thus far, the Supreme Court has tended to side with the Libertarians. 
<p>
But in any case, that will continue to be debated so long as we have the freedom to do so. It will be debated long after the new Gambling Commission issues its ponderous reports, which when all is said and done, are not likely to effect the outcome of the debate in this society much at all. That's all for Direct Line for tonight.

<p></h3><h2>
The Next American Revolution
<p></h2><p><p>
<blockquote>
This past Spring, President Clinton took the unprecedented step of praising his opponent, Bob Dole, for insisting that a disclaimer be added to the Republican Party platform.  The disclaimer calls for tolerance for opposing opinions.  For weeks, the issue was the Republican's so-called anti-abortion plank.  The establishment media feasted on the debate over whether to amend the language.  While Clinton cheered him on, Dole finally resolved to put the tolerance disclaimer in the preamble to the platform, although for awhile he seemed wrestle with a decision to put the tolerance language directly in the paragraph which addresses the issue of abortion.
<P>
Interestingly, no such call for tolerance is leveled against the Democratic Platform.  Look at the language of the two platforms: the Republican plank actually says little about abortion and weakly calls for a human life amendment which would have no guarantee of saving unborn lives.  The Democratic Party Plank strongly asserts the practice of abortion on demand and even calls for a national law to enforce the practice.  Again, not one word is offered to suggest Democrats should adopt changes in their pro-abortion plank, not even words of tolerance.
<p>
Ultimately the real debate this year is much larger than opposing platforms.  The real contest this year is no longer between Republicans and Democrats. It is a contest which pits Washington against its own citizens.  Let's be honest about one thing: the Republican and Democratic parties are both pretty much run by establishment politicians. Yet, what our culture badly needs is honesty in its political process.  Our society desperately needs elected leaders who maintain the courage of their convictions.
<p>
All of this may require a third political party.  If that is the case, then so be it.  You see, America has reached a great crossroads in its history.  Our nation faces a great dilemma  our government is in debt bordering on insolvency.  Meanwhile, increasingly, our country faces threats from unknown entities throughout the world in the form of terrorism.
<p>
What we need more than anything else is prayer; the prayer of honest citizens that our elected leaders act responsibly; prayer that our culture turns from its tailspin of depravity; prayer that God, who at one time blessed this great nation of ours, will again restore our nation to moral and fiscal health.
God has given us a wonderful gift. He has given us a nation in which its citizens are free to worship, speak, own property, and elect popular leaders. But slowly we have allowed our elected leaders and cultural elitists to squandered that gift, through debt, moral erosion, lawlessness and political deceit. I believe God can judge America or save America. It's up to us. But time is running out, both for our economic and spiritual well-being.
<p>
If we as a nation return to the faith and righteous principles upon which this country was founded, I believe God will once restore to our nation the America we once were. May God help us to pray for that to happen.

<h2>Business-As-Usual No Longer Works</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<P>

This morning's Washington Post is just gloating over Republican Senators who, the Post says, have rediscovered government. They cite among others, Senator Bob Bennett of Utah who fought to add another $10 million to the appropriations for the National Endowment for the Arts because, he says, the Endowment supports dozens of small cultural entities in Utah.<P>
The Post describes Bennett as a Mormon with strong culturally conservative views. Those views, the paper is happy to report, were not enough to override his desire to bring federal money to his state, even though the National Endowment for the Arts funds pornography and homosexual art. The last time I checked, neither was well thought of in Mormon circles.<P>
But the case of Bennett, and several other Republican Senators mentioned, serves to illustrate why the Republican attempt to balance the budget by 2002 absent a Constitutional Amendment is folly. There are always just enough so-called conservative Senators who are willing to play the game of trying to be the local hero who brought home the federal bacon. Therefore cutting federal spending becomes next to impossible.<P>
We had cultural activities in my hometown, but local people supported them with their own money. If they didn't, the local symphony and museums and other projects would have disappeared. And this is as it should be.<P>
If the question is should cultural projects in Utah be funded by the rest of us taxpayers, sure voters will say yes. But if the question is should we as a nation go into debt to fund these projects, my betting is the answer would be different. Bennett, I am willing to wager, could maintain his political support by posing the second question rather than the first.<P>
This Congress came within a single vote of passing a Constitutional Amendment to balance the budget. With Bill Clinton continuing to lead Bob Dole and Ross Perot by such impressive numbers, I fear that the next Congress will be even less willing to pass such an amendment. Yet the fiscal condition of the nation demands that this be done. We are on the verge of bankruptcy.<P>
I have to give credit to Perot and Dick Lamm, the rivals in the Reform party. At least they are talking about this issue. You don't hear either Bill Clinton or Bob Dole saying much about it, and they would say nothing at all if the Reform party weren't in the mix.<P>
If the next Congress is unable to muster the two-thirds vote necessary to pass a Constitutional Amendment, then there is no alternative to a Constitutional Convention to take up that issue, term limits and other such questions which are beyond the courage of the Congress. Then at least the states would be given the chance to ratify or reject such proposals. My guess is that at the state level, a balanced budget would get overwhelming approval.<P>
The politicians like Bennett just don't get it yet. The way we've done business for the past sixty years just doesn't work anymore. The nation can't afford it. But since there seems to be no hope of replacing enough ordinary politicians in the Congress, our only hope is an extraordinary measure such as a Constitutional Convention. I regret that is the case and there are dangers in calling such a convention. But the alternative is to have business as usual and this business is going belly up.<P><P>

<h2>Bob Dole and His Convention</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<P>
<P>It is a strange world, this world of politics. Reality seldom penetrates the consciousness of the players. Perceptions, which are often created by one's political enemies, become reality. And politicians act upon that false reality. <P>Such is the case concerning the 1992 Republican national convention in Houston.<P>On the first day of the convention, the man who challenged President Bush, Pat Buchanan, gave a barn burner of a speech. The late John Chancellor of NBC called it one of the finest speeches he had ever heard at a convention and that was saying something since Chancellor had covered politics since the 1950's. Also speaking that evening were former Education Secretary and Drug Czar Bill Bennett and former President Ronald Reagan. Both gave excellent speeches. Polls were taken that night and for the one and only time during the peak political season, George Bush led Bill Clinton in the Presidential race.<P>But other media began to criticize both the Bennett and Buchanan speeches, especially the part of Buchanan's speech where he suggested we were in the midst of a culture war. Excerpts of that speech were played over and over again, out of context, and Buchanan was ripped apart by the media and by liberal politicians. When George Bush lost to Bill Clinton, this same media blamed his loss on Buchanan and conservatives who allegedly scared moderate women away from the Republicans. <P>Now mind you, those speeches, including Buchanan's, only helped Bush in all actuality. In truth, George Bush was fired by the American people for two reasons. First because he pledged not to raise taxes and then engineered the largest tax increase in history up to that point. Second because Bush seemed to be preoccupied with foreign affairs at a time when the United States was in a mild recession. <P>One person, however, bought the media line about 1992 wholesale. That person is Bob Dole. Determined not to scare these same fictitious voters, Dole has banned Pat Buchanan from speaking in a major time slot at the convention, even though Buchanan ended up the runner up in the Presidential contest. Such a move is without precedent in modern American politics. Moreover, Dole has put forward the feminist Republican Susan Molinari as the keynote speaker. Colin Powell, a self declared Rockefeller Republican who disagrees with most of the GOP platform, will also be featured that first night. The Dole advisers are confident that when he puts forth this moderate image to the American people they will come flocking to him in droves. <P>It is an interesting theory. By that measure, Dole can be elected President by doing what the media wants. Never mind that in reality Dole will be driving away millions of conservative voters in the process. That is the truth. Oh, yes, and there is one other little problem. The media loves Bill Clinton much more than Bob Dole no matter what Dole does to try to please them. When all is said and done they won't give him much credit for doing what they have proscribed for the Republican party. Perceptions will vanish and reality will hit home to Bob Dole on election night. For Dateline Washington, I'm Paul Weyrich.

<h2>Racism, Sexism Revisited</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>
<P>
<P>
Bill Lind's recent series of commentaries on Political Correctness created quite a stir here at NET.  We have had a substantial internal debate about whether, particularly, his commentary of Monday, July 9 promotes or invites racism.  We've also had some discussion about his July 10 commentary on sexism.
When authentic, racism is extremely harmful because it fails to consider the worth and dignity of each person as an individual.  As Mr. Lind noted in one of his commentaries, "Wise people judge other individuals as individuals, not as members of any group."<P>
Our culture has indeed become so Politically Correct, so infected by false racism and irrational sexism, that it has become quite difficult to discuss any of these issues without being accused of committing that which one would condemn.  People today are so often told that they are victims of characteristics beyond their control that they tend to believe it.  Worse, those who have experienced real discrimination, yet whose lives are dedicated to rising above it by courageously finding ways up, over and around it, are the most seriously harmed by false discrimination.  Why?  Because false discrimination tends to become confused with authentic discrimination.  Real discrimination thus becomes harder to detect, which means that fewer citizens take action to stamp it out.<P>
The late Dr. Martin Luther King urged Americans to judge people by the content of their character.  We at NET, and at its founding organization, the Free Congress Foundation, agree with that statement.  We do not espouse or condone racism in any form.  We are committed to the fair treatment of everyone.  Consequently we condemn both real and false racism.<P>
As Mr. Lind also noted in last week's series, we recognize that men and women are different.  Complementary, but different.  Thus we believe, for example, that single-sex education, recently condemned by the Supreme Court, should be supported in this country; we endorse parental choice in education.  That does not deny that many young men and women do well in a co-educational environment; nor does it deny that most men and women are able to perform the vast majority of  jobs equally well.  However, we disagree with the feminist view that there are no differences between men and women.  That view is a delusion. It is a failure to recognize physical reality.  We are not all the same; each of us is a unique individual, deserving of respect as such.<P>
In our NET commentaries, we intend to discuss difficult, contentious issues.  Our editorial viewpoint is, for example, uncompromisingly pro-life and pro-family.  We will continue to express ourselves, and to present guest commentaries on controversial issues, because we believe you, our viewers, are well-served by discussions of issues rarely presented elsewhere with forthrightness based on a search for truth.  And when our commentaries create controversy internally, we will continue to have open, frank discussions.  Your views are important to us as well; they enrich our discussions, and they help us to know you better.  So we invite you to call, write, fax and e-email us whenever you wish to comment on an issue, or on anything else we do.<P>

<h2>Lamm Candidacy Adds Dimension</h2>
<P>
<blockquote>
<p>

<P>
I was out of the country when former Colorado Governor Dick Lamm announced that he was going to run for President. Fortunately, I returned last night from Bulgaria just in time to see the repeat of that press conference on C SPAN.<P>
Lamm has burned his bridges and has now agreed to support the nominee of the Reform party, even if that nominee is Ross Perot, against whom Lamm is now running for the Presidential nomination.<P>
On the surface Lamm's candidacy looks like a quixotic one. He is barely known outside of Colorado. He is running in the party which Perot founded with Perot's money. It is unclear who will vote in that party primary, which is being conducted by mail over a several day period.<P>
Lamm has only about a month to get himself well enough known that he would have a shot at defeating Perot in the Reform party primary. Given his lack of financial resources, Lamm would seem to be a sure loser to Perot. But Lamm is touching a chord with his message. In fact, his candidacy was the result of his stark assessment of where we as a nation have gone wrong. He delivered that assessment to a state convention in California. Delegates, right then and there, circulated a petition and urged Lamm to run. Other states followed. This prompted Perot, who had planned on a coronation for the Reform party nomination, to announce prematurely that he was likely to run again and so the campaign has begun.
Mind you I completely disagree with Governor Lamm's social issues policies. We are about as far apart as two people can get on that spectrum. But I have long admired Dick Lamm as a man who believes in what he says and has the courage of his convictions.<P>
I am also a big fan of former Colorado Senator Bill Armstrong, who in my view, missed his calling by not being a Presidential candidate in 1996. I think he would have swept all the others away. Were he the nominee, Republicans would not now be facing the sort of electoral disaster that awaits them if Bill Clinton continues to hold on to the sort of numbers he has now.<P>
The year was 1984 and Armstrong was seeking his second term in the U.S. Senate. Dick Lamm was then Governor of Colorado and widely thought to be a possible candidate for the Senate. Armstrong proposed that if Lamm were the Democratic candidate for the Senate, the two of them should go city by city throughout Colorado together, debating the issues. For whatever reason Lamm did not run that year. I suspect he wasn't sure he could defeat the equally articulate Armstrong.<P>
What a Senate campaign that would have been. Two of the most knowledgeable and attractive candidates ever to have run for public office debating real issues in the public forum. That is the way our system ought to work. <P>
Now Lamm is out there for President and the odds are very much against him. Unfortunately he has to run at a time when the American voters are least tuned into politics. It is a pity because, agree or disagree, they need to hear what Lamm has to say. He is making points that other politicians simply refuse to talk about. True, Bob Dole does pay lip service to the notion that excessive spending by government is not a good idea, even though he has helped to pass much of what he now complains about.<P>
Lamm, coming as he does from the liberal wing of the Democratic party, has the greater impact on such issues. What Dole says is expected from a Republican candidate. When Lamm says it, it has real credibility. Dick Lamm is to entitlements and the bankruptcy of America what Richard Nixon was to China. His message is tough, but he has a non-threatening personality. Lamm can say what he says without scaring people the way some republicans manage to do so. He makes you stop and think. And by the way, what he says about entitlements is the same thing that senators Al Simpson of Wyoming and Robert Kerry of Nebraska have been saying now for some time. Perhaps at the Presidential level Lamm can get the audience Simpson and Kerry have never managed to get.<P>
I wish Dick Lamm well. His policies on values questions preclude my voting for him but I think he is doing the nation a service just by running. He brings a desperately needed level of candor to the Presidential campaign in which Bill Clinton lies, Bob Dole speaks unintelligibly, and Ross Perot speaks only in platitudes.<P>
If by some wholly unexpected chance he were to defeat Perot in his own primary and go on to the general election, Lamm would totally destabilize the November election scene. Liberals would have an alternative to Bill Clinton and conservatives whose primary focus is our entitlement mess would have an alternative to Bob Dole. A debate between the three of them is a Presidential campaign to die for.<P>
Just like the exciting possibility back in Colorado in 1984, it is unlikely to happen. But given this uninspiring political campaign, our thanks to Dick Lamm for giving us something to at least dream about.<P>

<h2>Disney's Moral Whitewash</h2>
<P>

Awhile back the Southern Baptist convention passed a resolution at their annual convention of Messengers calling on their members to boycott Walt Disney theme parks, movies and merchandise.<P>
Granted the Southern Baptists cant control what their members do and many of them are not likely to go along with the boycott; still it is an uncomfortable position for Disney to be in with the largest Protestant denomination in the United States telling its membership to stay away from Disney properties.<P>
The Southern Baptists were protesting not only the Disney decision, as a corporation, to grant benefits to homosexual partnerships but also recent Disney distributed films.  For example, last year Disney released "the Priest," a movie which portrayed a homosexual clergyman sympathetically. Indeed, even what are supposed to be classic style Disney movies such as "the Lion King" and the "Hunchback of Notre Dame" are now filled with sexual references. Reviewers are even suggesting that "Hunchback" is not an appropriate movie for children. Michael Eisner and company have taken the Disney company a long way from its pro family roots. No wonder the Disney theme parks now sport a Gay and Lesbian pride day with special discounts for public displays of such behavior.<P>
So to the rescue comes Father Leo ODonovan, the President of Georgetown University, one of the most venerable Catholic institutions in the nation. He has just been elected to a two year term on the Disney board. Father ODonovan can be expected to uphold traditional Judeo Christian moral values, right? ODonovan is Eisners market response to the move by the Southern Baptists, right?<P>
Well, think again. ODonovan is to traditional Catholics what John Chaffee is to traditional Republicans. ODonovan is a liberal Catholic. He has been elected to the board not to make the Disney company sensitive to traditional morality but to give Eisner cover. Already he has defended the Disney decision to grant benefits to homosexual couples as standard industry practice and he has defended the Disney distribution of the movie "the Priest." ODonovan says that a company or an individual cant be judged by "a single act or production, or wed never lead lives or have businesses."<P>
Are you surprised? Im not. Georgetown has its own Gay pride activities with the full blessing of ODonovan. Indeed ODonovan has done his best to remove what little vestiges of the Catholic faith remained at Georgetown.<P>
Soon after he became President six years ago, ODonovan showed up here at a dinner party I had to discuss our pioneer television efforts. I say showed up because I hadnt invited him. He came as the uninvited guest of someone we did ask to come. It was clear ten minutes into our conversation that he was a liberal who will defend just about anything on the liberal agenda.<P>
Eisner was not bowing to market pressure from the Baptists and the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights which has similarly blasted Disney. Eisner was looking for someone with credentials who could defend the company and give a thumbs up for its immoral practices. Well since Notre Dames former President Theodore Hesburgh is too busy serving on Bill Clintons legal defense fund board, I guess ODonovan was the next best thing. Besides, Hesburgh is well known as a liberal. ODonovan isnt, so he will be more useful to Eisner.<P>
No, if Disney is serious about wanting some moral input, I am sure Dr. James Dobson, or the Presbyterian intellectual D. James Kennedy or one of the many former Presidents of the Southern Baptists would be available. Or if Disney really does want the genuine Catholic point of view, I suggest Cardinal OConnor of New York or Cardinal Law of Boston.<P>
What Disney needs is someone on its board who will represent the point of view of parents to the company and not the other way around. Eisner is clever.  Appointing ODonovan is a good public relations move. But the Southern Baptists and the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights are still correct. What Disney is producing these days is a disgrace. The company should be boycotted. Real economic pressure will force real change. The ODonovan appointment, far from a bow to the traditional values community, represents business as usual.<P>

<h2>Faith and Global Stability</h2>
<P>
<P>
<P>
The White House, the State Department, and the United Nations are happy over the result of the Russian elections this past week.  Incumbent Boris Yeltsin won.  The White House, the State Department, and the United Nations were not happy over the result of the Israeli elections last month.  The incumbent lost.<P>
This mentality speaks volumes for the modern world view of global stability.  The world leaders now put the concept of global stability above risk, higher than right and wrong, and ahead of principle.  This means that human rights, individual freedoms and even democracy now take a back seat to the new global imperative of maintaining stability, status quo, and "peace."<P>
No policy is without an overriding philosophy and global stability is no exception. Its philosophy is relativism, a mentality which holds that truth and even morality can only be defined within the context of todays events.<P>
Today, those who question the philosophy of relativism are scorned by the popular culture, in the press, on TV and in Hollywood.<P>
Ask U.S. Supreme Court justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.  Speaking at separate events, Scalia and Thomas recently told of the importance of faith in God.  Thomas was criticized for his religious views.  Academia laughed at Scalia for believing in angels.  The culture wants to stop jurists like Scalia, Thomas and William Rhenquist for applying Constitutional absolutes to legal cases for a society which has begun to question eternal truth and moral absolutes.<P>
I for one agree with Scalia. Let them laugh.  Angels are real.  We cant see God and we cant see the wind.  Yet God and the wind exist whether the cultural engineers like it or not.  In fact, its not what they think that matters but what God thinks that really matters.  Thats the faith perspective. Thats exactly whats missing from the new world view of the White House, the State Department and the United Nations.<P>
The faith perspective understands right from wrong.  The faith perspective realizes there is something much greater at stake than the futile pursuit of peace through stability.  A faith perspective requires leaders to take a moral stand, armed with absolutes which modern events simply cannot change.<P>
Murder and stealing are forbidden by our laws. Why?  Because life and charity are good things according to the precepts of God who does not change.<P>
Our society began with a belief in God and with faith.  Look at the words on our coins.  It doesnt say in the world we trust, in the UN we trust, or even in government we trust.  Our nation began with a cultural trust in God and a societal faith in Gods precepts.<P>
The faith of a nation is a powerful quality.  It has made the twentieth century the century of America, a nation founded on belief in God.<P>
Our nation will never end with a belief in God, but it can end without a belief in God, and we must never let that happen.  Its time to end the global stability and moral relativity lock on our future.  America doesnt need a UN to tell us where weve been or a faithless government to tell us where we can go.  What America needs today is a few good citizens, of faith and courage, to safely guide us into the next great century.<P>

<h2>Cigarettes and Aliens in Washington
</h2>
<P>

There's a new movie out this week, appropriately named "Independence Day."  In Washington, this movie is so hot, they are running a 4 a.m. showing at the Uptown Theater and even that is sold out.  "Independence Day" is about aliens who take over and eventually destroy the White House.  The world is next on their agenda.<P>
The trouble is, the movie is about three years too late.  The aliens have occupied the White House since George Bush left in 1993.  No plot from Hollywood could possibly come close to what we already have with these diabolical aliens.  There's the First Lady who doesn't remember making a call from Arkansas the night lawyer Vince Foster mysteriously died.  There's the Vice President who advocates a new world order run by environmentalists.  There's the president who tells one group he's pro-life and then supports the practice of partial birth abortions.  This is the White House that ordered FBI summary files on its political enemies.  These are the aliens who brought us Whitewater, travel-gate and "I feel your pain."<P>
Let's just say I'm glad I'm not running the President's reelection campaign.  His party has their hands full trying to contain a candidate who has begun to hemorrhage in the polls.<P>
Perhaps the Democratic party has found a way out.  They recently discovered what they are sure will be a scandal against Republican opponent Bob Dole.  The scandal they have begun to stoke is cigarettes.  It seems Bob Dole used to smoke cigarettes. Unlike the President, Mr. Dole admits that he actually inhaled.  The Democrats are so certain they have a marketable scandal against Dole, they've even hired an actor to follow the Dole campaign.  Each morning the actor dresses himself as a seven-foot cigarette.  The actor who portrays this giant cigarette calls himself "Butt Man."  The idea is that Mr. Dole is somehow villainous because his campaign has received money from cigarette conglomerates.  What's worse, Mr. Dole won't even say he's sorry.<P>
The Democratic National Committee says it is proud of "Butt Man."  What else can they talk about?  After all, Dole is about as scandalous as Socks the Cat-and we're told Socks even counts mice among his friends.<P>
"Butt Man" probably won't be coming to a town near you.  Certainly "Independence Day" will soon be playing at theater near you.  If you go to see it, remember to follow these simple rules of theater etiquette.  First, don't talk when the movie begins, that irritates other viewers. Second, don't laugh when you see the White House blow up, it really isn't funny. And finally, whatever you do, don't smoke. The real aliens just might attack you, in the press.<P>

<h2>The Establishment is Having a Fit</h2>
<P>

<P>
                      Establishment Republicans across the country are upset at the rising influencing of
                      anti-establishment Conservatives in their party. These party professionals have drawn
                      quiet sympathy from their Democratic counterparts who share their disdain over the
                      revolutionary voices of an anti-Washington public threatening the status quo of the
                      cozy two-party system.
<P>
                      In Kansas, the establishment has quietly criticized Sam Brownback, a conservative
                      freshman Congressman, because he is running for Bob Dole's vacated Senate seat.
                      The Republican establishment has chosen a liberal to fill the seat, and view
                      Brownback as a threat to the carefully-crafted status quo.
<P>
                      In South Carolina, eleven Christian conservatives outpaced former Governor Carroll
                      Campbell this Spring in the voting for the state's delegates to the National Convention.
                      Campbell was furious that unknowns would challenge the establishment. "I play in a
                      much bigger league than they do," Campbell later told reporters. "I don't have time to
                      fool with them."
<P>
                      All of this intolerance towards anti-establishment conservatives is masked in official
                      calls for tolerance toward liberals in the Republican party. The center of gravity in
                      today's political debate is the culture. The issue most symbolic of the cultural debate is
                      abortion. It is for this reason that the establishment insists on language of tolerance
                      only in the abortion plank.
<P>                      At the same time, no such call for tolerance is leveled against the Democratic
                      Platform. Look at the language of the two platforms: the Republican plank actually
                      says little about abortion and weakly calls for a human life amendment which would
                      have no guarantee of saving unborn lives. The Democratic Party Plank strongly asserts
                      the practice of abortion on demand and even calls for a national law to enforce the
                      practice. Again, not one word is offered to suggest Democrats should adopt changes
                      in their pro-abortion plank, not even words of tolerance.

                      While the two parties continue to apply a double meaning to the term "tolerance," a
                      vast group of Americans have begun to rethink their support for the Republican Party.
                      In fact, the day is coming when ordinary American voters will no longer be able to tell
                      the two parties apart. When that happens, it is likely that a new, anti-establishment
                      party will arise, fueled by a public outraged at being ignored by both Republicans and
                      Democrats.

                      You see the real debate this year is much larger than opposing platforms. The real
                      contest this year is no longer between Republicans and Democrats. It is a contest
                      which pits Washington against its own citizens. Let's be honest about one thing: the
                      Republican and Democratic parties are both pretty much run by professional
                      politicians. It is this same establishment that long ago took Washington into captivity,
                      controlling the media, lobbying for special interests

<h2>When Whitewater Wasn't Cool
</h2>
<P>

There is an old country song which goes, "I was country, when country wasn't cool."  Like the song, there was a time when Whitewater, as a news story, wasn't cool.  Now that Special Counsel Ken Starr has secured actual jury convictions, and now that Attorney General Janet Reno has added "Filegate" to Starr's portfolio, Starr and Whitewater enjoy generally-accepted credibility.<P>
Today Whitewater is cool.  But I remember the days when Whitewater wasn't cool.  I recall 1994, when Washington Times investigative reporter Jerry Seper uncovered factual Whitewater information on an almost daily basis. On Whitewater, Seper spent weeks meticulously fitting together the factual pieces of a puzzle scattered over a ten year period, strewn across Arkansas and Washington, DC, and overlooked by establishment reporters who sat on the facts because Whitewater wasn't cool.<P>
At the same time, NET-television network began a weekly "Whitewater Update" on "Capitol Watch."  NET tried to get the painfully uncompromising Mr. Seper on our program, but found him routinely unavailable for the limelight. Fortunately, we managed convince several of his colleagues to help us present to our live call-in audience the factual details known at the time.  Editorial Page Editor Tod Lindberg, editorial writer Eric Felton, and even Wesley Pruden helped NET interpret the latest facts in a case which was, for other networks, too difficult for the nightly news.  Indeed, Whitewater wasn't cool.<P>
Talk radio played a hand back then. The Seper and Times reports were reliable talking points for an audience trapped between a media establishment trying to avoid Whitewater as a story and hucksters trying to exploit Whitewater for profit.  Even then much of the public new there was a story amidst the confusion.  Whitewater was a story which simply wouldn't go away.<P>
Whitewater wasn't cool then, but it became fashionable later.  As the 104th Congress began its hearings and Special Counsel Starr took over the investigation, gradually the story began to achieve its acceptance.  Seper continued his work. The editorial page added its perspective for readers of the new National Weekly edition and for Insight magazine.  Talk radio and NET continued to take calls.<P>
Finally Starr's work produced its first indictments  former business partners of the First Lady, Susan and James McDougal, and the Governor of Arkansas, Jim Guy Tucker. Conventional wisdom said the Governor and Susan McDougal would win acquittals partly because the Little Rock jury had not been sequestered and names of the jurists were published in the local papers.  Yet, Starr's efforts prevailed and the jury convicted each of the defendants.  Thus, Whitewater became "cool."<P>
Today Whitewater and its cousins, "Filegate" and "Travelgate," have become the story of the year.  Today a pool of reporters have jumped into the cool current of Whitewater.  They go to bed with visions of Pulitzer dancing in their heads. Few may realize they have a story built on the foundation of work quietly produced by the likes of Jerry Seper. To the readers of the Washington Times, the listeners of talk radio, and the viewers of NET, Whitewater was always a story.  We were Whitewater when Whitewater wasn't cool.<P>

<h2>The Communists are Going to Lose
</h2>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>



It appears to me that the Communists are about to lose the elections in   

Russia.  I say this because I have watched elections in which they have   

participated in for over 35 years.  Absolutely every time they think they   

are going to lose they begin to complain that the election process is   

rigged with fraud ahead of time.  Well that is happening now with a   

vengeance as the Communists hope to discredit any victory by Russian   

President Boris Yeltsin.<P>

Yeltsin, for his part, has been running very tough television commercials   

narrated by famous Russian actors calling to mind the days of terror   

inflicted on the Russian people by Stalin, the times of famine due to the   

Communist system, the lack of freedom to travel and worship and so on.<P>   

The pro Yeltsin narrators say of Gennady Zuganov, the Communist candidate   

for President, that the Communists now claim that they are different than   

those of old but, in fact, they are not. These American style television   

commercials have a point. While Zuganov tones down his views when he is   

speaking to Western reporters, out on the hustings when speaking to the   

party faithful he doesn't hesitate to invoke the name of Stalin and he   

makes no apologies for the Communist era which he said brought Russians   

stability.<P>

One aspect of the Russian campaign which has interesting implications is   

the effort by Boris Yeltsin's newfound electoral partner Alexander Lebed   

to denounce aspects of Western culture.  Since the fall of the Soviet   

Union in l99l, Russia has been invaded by American soap operas, American   

pornographic magazines, American R and X rated movies, American punk   

fashions and contemporary American morals.  Lebed, while somewhat friendly   

to the West politically, has denounced this trashy Western influence on   

the Russian culture and has promised that , if continued in power, he   

will do his best to rid the nation of such corrupting elements.  Lebed   

placed a strong third in the first round of the Russian elections and   

Yeltsin hired him as his security chief the next day.  Lebed has been more   

visible than Yeltsin this past week as the campaign heads to July 3rd for   

the final round.<P>

It will be interesting to see if the Russian voters respond to Lebed's   

promise to rid Russia of the degrading aspects of Western culture.  If   

they do, American politicians might take note.  While this country would   

not respond well to the authoritarian suggestions of Lebed, I think the   

climate is right for a political figure to finally have the courage to   

say "enough is enough" when it comes to the ever degrading television   

shows, movies and printed material that constantly flows forth these   

days.  There are still enough people who adhere to the Judeo Christian   

moral structure in this country to make a mighty difference if any   

credible political figure would tell them what they are anxiously waiting   

to hear. <P>

<h2>Second Thoughts About a Constitutional Convention
</h2>
<P>
<P>
<P>


I am about to upset a lot of people. So get your pens ready, crank up your computers, and oil your fax machines. Here we go. <P>
I am sitting here thinking about another dreadful Supreme Court decision, the 7 to 1 rendering on the VMI case which outlaws same sex educational institutions. It paves the way for women in combat and a host of other things we have fought over the years. It continues what my colleague Tom Jipping has called "the cultural Jihad." <P>
I, of course, have called for the impeachment of the majority on this court, although I know how far that will get. Still, the question is, as Lenin once said, "What is to be done?" <P>
If you watched Direct Line Wednesday night you understand that Congress will do nothing about this decision. There are constitutional remedies available to the Congress, such as withdrawing jurisdiction from the Court on certain issues, but they never, ever use them. Lets face it, after more than fifty years of watching the Court erode its power, the Congress is afraid to do anything about it. <P>
I keep thinking of what the Court has done to votes of the people such as in the Colorado homosexual rights case and in the Arkansas term limits case and on and on. I will bet that had the people in Virginia voted on VMI or the people of South Carolina voted on the Citadel they would have voted to uphold tradition. It is clear that with this Court the votes of the people dont matter. <P>
This Court keeps altering the Constitution to the point where it can no longer be recognized. They find rights which are not there. They do not respect, in any way, the 10th Amendment which reserves to the states and to the people those matters which are not specifically enumerated in the Constitution. <P>
The argument against a Constitutional Convention is that it would change our constitutional form of government. But our form of government is being changed by this Supreme Court case by case, year by year. The Court does so without the consent of the governed or even of the Congress elected by the governed. With this Court there is no Constitution unless it is found convenient to resurrect it from time to time. <P>
I know this is going to send my friend Phyllis Schlafly into orbit and I will be forever branded as a traitor to my country by various committees of correspondence who busy the fax machines and the Internet. But I have to ask the question. Can we be worse off with a Constitutional Convention elected by the people than we are with a Court that constantly undoes the work of the people? <P>
I guess I have more faith in the people than others do. I recall that the same fears which have been expressed about a national Constitutional Convention were expressed about both Maryland and Louisiana when they held such conventions to rewrite their state constitutions. No real damage was done in Maryland, despite it being one of the most liberal states in the country. Louisianas constitution came out far better after the convention than before. <P>
If my good friends at the NRA, the Christian Coalition, in pro-life groups, and a host of other groups can help win elections all around the country, why cant they help elect a majority to a Constitutional Convention? If we ran slates of delegates to such a convention on a reform ticket which included items such as term limits and a real balanced budget amendment with tax limitation and so on, Ill bet we would win a majority of the convention hands down. Maybe then we could change the Constitution to protect the unborn, insure that citizens have their rights restored on issues such as Amendment Two in Colorado, insure that the court cannot repeal human nature as they have tried to do in the VMI case, and so on.
It is true that we could lose the elections to such a convention. That is always the chance you take when the people vote. But what is the alternative? At least such a Convention would be acting on a vote of the people. The way things stand, our way of life, our Constitution, our culture, our system of government are all being changed by a Court which is responsible to no one. Do we sit here and let it happen? Or do we try to take back our country? My colleague Bill Lind wants a new political party. Well and good, but what will that accomplish if this Court takes all of our rights away in the meanwhile? <P>
Let me make something clear. I revere the work of the Founding Fathers. I think the Constitution they produced has a near sacred quality to it. I believe it produced the best government the world has seen for a century and a half. Remember that these same Founding Fathers provided for the very Constitutional Convention we are discussing. <P>
But lets face it, the era when the Constitution was respected by the Supreme Court has long been over. Several Republican Presidents have tried to appoint so called "strict constructionists" to the court to reverse what has been happening since the New Deal. It hasnt worked. The majority in the VMI case were Republican appointees. <P>
It seems to me that we have to face reality. I want the opponents of a Constitutional Convention to make the case to me that we are better off letting this runaway Court strip us of our heritage on a systematic basis, than we would be if the people had a chance to elect a convention that could express their will.
I think a national election for a convention would be a very serious affair. Ill bet it would be treated that way by the voters and it would be a remarkable opportunity to educate people about what our constitutional form of government should be. Im sorry, but I cant accept the view that we should do nothing. We mourn and we complain and we express regret at what is happening but we do nothing.
I say it is hard for me to imagine that we would be worse off than we are now with a vote of the same people who passed term limits, voted for Amendment Two in Colorado, voted for three strikes and youre out in California, and so on. <P>
Go ahead. Come at me. Lets debate this proposition. It sure is better than sitting around and ringing our hands. <P>

<h2>Clinton Dodges Another Scandal
</h2>
<P>
<P>
<P>







It is always nice to have friends on the Supreme Court. Bill Clinton had at least four of them which is why he won't be giving depositions this Summer in the Paul Jones sexual harassment suit. The court agreed to take up the question of whether or not a President can face a civil suit during his term in office. Now the court will decide in l997 if the decision by the court of appeals that the lawsuit may proceed is valid. Had the High court simply upheld the decision of the appeals court, the law suit would have gone ahead. <P>

But then we shouldn't be surprised. Bill Clinton's entire history is one of close calls and of voters giving him the benefit of the doubt. And it appears they are about to do so again.<P>

Of all the data I have reviewed on elections, which began with a tutorial the pollster Richard Wirthlin gave me in l970 right after then California Governor Ronald Reagan's re-election, I must say I consider some of the recent findings most remarkable.<P>

The public does understand that President Clinton is less than honest. The public believes that the White House is not telling the truth on filegate. The public believes that Hillary Clinton is lying. The public thinks that Bill Clinton is not a good role model for children. The public thinks that the Clintons have covered up their role in Whitewater. But the public says they want Bill Clinton to be President anyway.<P>

Because I rise at 4:30 every morning, I seldom watch the late night TV shows. But I didn't have to get up Saturday morning so I tuned in for a change. Non stop jokes about Bill and Hillary. Jokes about the President dating while in office. Jokes about the President's friends serving time in prison. Lots of jokes about the First Lady, and that was before the revelations about her conversations with long dead political figures. For example, in comparing music to politics, Jay Leno said that in music Dolly Parton does 9 to 5. But in politics Hillary Clinton will be doing 5 to 9. And so it goes, I am told, night after night and the audience cheers, yet they continue to favor the President's re-election. <P>

What gives here? How could voters believe someone is dishonest, has become a sort of national joke, and yet is favored to win in November.<P>

Senator Kay Bailey Hutchinson thinks the problem is that the media has so devalued the Presidency that voters now believe it doesn't matter who we present as our leader to the rest of the world. Author Kevin Phillips believes that the voters are so cynical, since they believe all politicians are dishonest, that they simply are inclined to be with the devil they know rather than the devil they don't know.<P>

I think there is a third factor at work. When you quiz voters about why they favor Bill Clinton's re-election, they will tell you that he understands their problems more than his rivals. Others will say he will do more for them than his opponents. I think what we have here is the ultimate conclusion of the "me generation". Bill Clinton is the defender of the status quo as far as government benefits are concerned. So voters are saying "I know this President is dishonest, but what the heck. He'll see to it I don't get hit too hard, so I'm going to support him and frankly I don't care what happens to the rest of the country." <P>

I think back to the young man who asked the l992 Presidential candidates at one of the debates how they were going to take care of him. Instead of telling the kid to go take care of himself, the candidates all fell over themselves telling him what they were going to do for him, but Bill Clinton gave him the most sympathetic answer. <P>

I think my driver John Blackwell, who also drives a taxi part-time in Washington and thus is in touch with the real world, has the right answer. Blackwell points out that over half of the population is now dependent on a government check of one kind or another. "The voters are just looking at their own pockets and thinking that Bill Clinton will keep their checks coming", Blackwell said. I am afraid he is right. <P>

It worked in Roman times. Bread and circuses kept the population happy as their freedoms were taken away. The public doesn't want to face the bad news that we are going bankrupt as a nation. That our debt is robbing us and especially our children and grandchildren blind. In a few more years, there simply won't be any money at all to pay the bills. But, hey, that's after Bill Clinton leaves office after his second term. Why should we worry? <P>

<h2>Hillary Talks to the Dead?
</h2>
<P>
<P>
<P>



According to Bob Woodward's new book "The Choice", Hillary Clinton held an imaginary conversation with the late First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, who died in l962. <P>

      Talking to Eleanor was the brainchild of Jean Houston, the Co-Director of the Foundation for Mind Research. <P>

      Now, of course, I wasn't present for that conversation between Hillary and Eleanor, but I can well imagine how it went. <P>

       "Oh, Eleanor", said Hillary," You just can't imagine what it is like being married to a man who almost never tells the truth". Replied Eleanor : "Come, come dear. I know exactly what it is like. In fact, that is why my husband is your husband's role model. And I must tell you it works. Take the Depression, for example. We never really did anything to solve it. In fact, things were worse in l938 than they were in l933 but people THOUGHT we had done something, and that's what is really important. You tell Bill to always sound confident. He should keep on saying things like 'the economy is in the best shape it has been in fifty years'. Now never mind that it isn't true. If he just says it often enough, people will believe it. Just think of how well he did by telling the voters in l992 that the economy was in the worst shape since the Depression. People believed him even though it was an outright lie. It's all in how you say it, my dear".<P>

           The conversation continued with Hillary asking for advice on Bosnia: "I'm not sure what we should do. My husband got us into the war over there. We promised to get our troops out before the election, but there is no way we are going to be able to do that. In fact, we may be there for years. What do we do?" Eleanor Roosevelt answered : "Well, that's a tough one. Franklin got us into the war by ignoring all of the warnings and failing to prevent Pearl Harbor. But you see, Hillary dear, we had Hitler and the Japs. You don't have enemies people can identify with. I'm afraid you have a harder task. About the only thing you can do is to start to remove the troops before the election. Send new ones quietly a few at a time and be ready to deploy lots of them the day after the election. But if people think they are coming home on schedule, they will go ahead and vote for Bill."<P>

             "Now let me ask you Eleanor, you don't mind if I call you Eleanor do you?", Hillary continued, "I feel as if I know you. I've read everything I can about you, I admire you so much." Eleanor replied "It's all right dear. We used to be more formal, but I understand the times, so go ahead call me Eleanor". <P>

               "Well", said Hillary, "I don't quite know how to raise this question. But I know you've had experience. You see Bill hasn't been exactly faithful. I mean dealing with the Paula Jones matter in public and all, how ever did you cope?" Eleanor turned somber. "Well I had one advantage over you. The press didn't pry into our personal lives in those days. The boys who covered Franklin all knew about Lucy. But they didn't say anything. All the things that have been published have seen the light years after Franklin died. In fact, decades after I died. So I never had to cope with the public humiliation of it all."<P>

               But Hillary persisted. "I'm sure you knew. How did you put up with it?" Said Eleanor in reply: "My dear. It is worth it being First Lady, especially when you have your own agenda. I did. Franklin didn't much agree with it. But he was in no position to object. In those days if I had left him, he would have been finished. So he let me do my own thing. I see that Bill lets you do what you want as well. That's good. Any time he gets testy about your doing what you want, you just remind him of what you know and how if you confirmed all the rumors, even in this day in age, he'd be packing for Tennessee". <P>

               "Arkansas", Hillary interrupted. "We're from Arkansas." Eleanor apologized. "Oh, I'm terribly sorry. I knew it was one of those states down there. Personally I preferred the North."

               Hillary went on : "I have other problems. There is the cattle futures issue and the billings at the Rose law firm and the allegations that I was the go between for people who wanted favors from Bill when he was Governor. Franklin was Governor before he was President. How did you manage these things?" Eleanor shook her head. "I'm afraid I can't help you. Women didn't hold down those kind of jobs when I was around. I will say this. I did get into trouble from time to time, and I found loss of memory to be an excellent way to handle things. No one can prove you remember anything." <P>

              "I've tried that and so far it has worked. But I'm worried", Hillary confessed. Eleanor broke into a smile. "My dear, so long as you have Bill to lie for you, don't worry. People want to believe their President. And even if his wife is unpopular, and believe me dear I was unpopular, so long as they are comforted by what their President says, they'll keep you right where you are."<P>

                "Even if I am indicted?", Hillary asked. "Well now", said Eleanor, "I don't know about that. I was careful. I never did anything they could get me for later."<P>

                "And what do I do if Bill loses?", Hillary whined. Eleanor looked puzzled. "We never had to cope with that problem. And I don't think you will either. After Bill's term, you run and then the two of you can serve longer than Franklin and me. But don't worry, there is life after the White House. I mean I did commercials for oleo margarine. I'm sure there are plenty of things you can sell. And you can always try writing a book."<P>

                  "I just did", Hillary replied. "I'm surprised you haven't heard about it. It's called 'It Takes a Village.'" <P>

                   "I'm terribly sorry", said Eleanor", But down here we don't hear about many new books. We do see MTV videos a lot, so if you make one of those I'm bound to see it. It is part of our punishment."<P>

                   "I think Bill is about to make one. Do you think he should wear boxers or briefs", Hillary asked. Eleanor pretended not to hear the question. <P>

<h2>For Less Than This Colson Went to Jail
</h2>
<P>
<P>

<P>
What a difference a couple of years makes. On May 22, 1994, White House advisor George Stephanopoulos said this of Craig Livingstone, the then director of the White House office of personnel security: "He does a terrific job. All I know is that anything that has to do with security or logistics  Craig's going to take care of it. You don't have to tell him how to do it, when to do it. Just that it needs to be done, and he does it. And he knows how to cut through the bureaucracy and get things done." Stephanopoulos told this to the Pittsburgh Post Gazette, Livingstone's home town newspaper.
<P>When confronted with the quote late last week, Stephanopoulos now says, "I don't know him that well. He's a guy that was around. He came up to me one day and said 'my paper's doing this and would you give them a quote' and I said 'sure.' I never worked with him on a campaign but he seemed competent. What can I tell you?"  As to the contention that Livingstone knows how to cut through the bureaucracy, Stephanopoulos says, "I just can't think of a specific thing he handled."
<P>Which version of the truth from the White House do you believe? This is, in fact, THE crucial question as we ponder the meaning of the issue over the hundreds of FBI files on Republicans turned over to the White House. The first spin put out by the White House was that Livingstone and Anthony Marceca were just low level bureaucrats who made a mistake.
<P>Now comes Denis Casey, the former Gary Hart for President campaign coordinator in Western Pennsylvania, who tells us that Livingstone and Marceca were busy gathering dirt on union officials who supported Walter Mondale in 1984.  They were doing this in an effort to try to blackmail the officials into switching to Hart's side to the point where Casey demanded that they be fired. The Casey testimony casts a whole different light on this issue. Livingstone and Marceca, it would seem, were professional political assassins who placed in charge of all of the sensitive material gathered by the FBI on their political opposition.
<P>Now the question is who put them in their positions? Who understood their background? To whom did they report? What did Bill Clinton know and when did he know it?
<P>Attorney General Janet Reno is absolutely right in asking that Independent Counsel Ken Strarr investigate this matter. It is not something which any person connected with the Clinton Administration can be trusted to handle. Let's remember that Chuck Colson, former Nixon White House aide, went to jail for showing a single FBI file to a reporter. We need to know why these FBI files were requested and exactly how the information therein was used.
<P>The fact that George Stephanopoulos could change his story on Livingstone so easily suggests that it is going to be very difficult getting at the truth on this issue. At the heart of the matter is no less than this question: Is the United States still a free nation where reasonable people can disagree and still continue to practice politics, or have we gone down the road to a dictatorship where if our opponents win the election, the rest of us have to live in fear over what comes next? <P>

<h2>Hope for Continued Democracy in Russia
</h2>
<P>
<P>
<P>The Russian people had themselves a remarkable election on Sunday. This is not a nation which has a tradition of democracy and yet turnout was higher than for most nations which do not make voting mandatory.
<P>Terrorists tried, with a series of bombs throughout the nation, to intimidate the voters. They did not do so. And while the election wasnt as fair as our elections, since the incumbent Boris Yeltsin controlled much of the television media, there is, nevertheless, substantial evidence that most of the Russian people followed the election.  There is also evidence that most of the Russian people were aware of the positions of the different candidates. 
<P>Since no candidate received the required 50% plus of the vote to be elected outright, there will be a runoff in three weeks between Yeltsin and Communist party boss Gannady Zyuganov. A word about that election in a moment, but first some thoughts on a few of the other candidates who ran.
<P>The surprise candidate who did far better than expected was General Alexander Lebed.   Lebed, on the one hand, is a supporter of democracy and free markets. On the other hand, he promises an authoritarian regime which will get tough with criminals. He often cites Chile under Gen. Pinochet as the appropriate model for Russia to prosper. The outcome in the runoff will probably be determined by where his votes go. Although Lebed is not pro-Communist, many of his supporters favor the Communist candidate Zyuganov because like Gen. Lebed, Zyuganov promises to bring back law and order. 
<P>Vladimir Zhirinovsky was the big loser in this election. The Russian voters apparently now see him for the fool that he is. He received only about 7% of the vote, a far cry from his showing in the last two parliamentary elections. No doubt he will favor Zyuganov in the runoff. But even if all of his voters go that route, it wont be enough to put Zyuganov over the top. 
<P>The democratic reformers did make somewhat of a showing with their candidate Gregory Yavilinsky who drew more votes than Zhirinovsky. Yavilinsky may reluctantly support Yeltsin in the runoff. Therefore, he could emerge in a new Yeltsin cabinet if there is one. 
<P>Meanwhile, Mikhail Gorbachev got so few votes that he hardly made the charts. This comes as a surprise only to Gorbachev. When Gorbachev left office he was terribly unpopular but he never believed that. His place secure in history as the man who opened up the process in Russia, he would have been well off to try to play the role of elder statesman. Instead he insisted on running because he believed the people were demanding his return. Now his stature is so diminished that it is clear he will never again play a role in Russian politics. 
<P>The runoff election is likely to be very close. First of all, some who voted for other candidates in this round will simply stay home. They feel they have no choice between Yeltsin and Zyuganov. Second, supporters of Yavilinsky, Sergei Filatov, and other Democrats will likely, very reluctantly, support Yeltsin. However, there are not enough of those votes to get Yeltsin the extra 15% he needs to win. 
<P>That is where Gen. Lebed comes in. Lebed will likely determine the outcome. If he goes with Yeltsin, he may be able to deliver enough of his vote to make the difference. If he goes with Zyuganov, he could give the Communist leader a real shot at being elected. 
<P>While the 35% of the vote is not exactly a ringing endorsement, it is remarkable that Yeltsin managed to get the most votes in the first round. Yeltsin has had to bear the burden of the enormous changes which have been visited on the Russian people these past five years. At one point he had sunk to only 8% in the public opinion polls and was written off as politically dead. The fact that he now has a fighting chance to win the runoff makes him the real "come back kid" of the democratic process. 
<P>The joke going around Moscow these days is that on the morning after the election, a Yeltsin aide comes to him and says he has good news and bad news.
<P>"Whats the bad news?" Yeltsin asks. 
<P>"The Communists got 55% of the vote," the aide says. 
<P>Yeltsin makes a terrible face and asks, "Then whats the good news?" 
<P>"You got 65% of the vote!" the aide declares.
This election may not have been totally honest, but it is a far cry from the rigged-in-advance kind of elections the Soviets staged for the 70 years they were in power.
<P>Russia took a major step forward in its fledgling democracy with this election. Now the voters in the runoff will have a choice between continuing to edge forward, no matter how erratically, or to try to restore the past. My bet is, that despite all the hardships they are enduring, the Russian people will not try to turn back the clock. <P>

<h2>Schott Censorship Sets Bad Precedent
</h2>
<P>
<P>Schott Censorship Sets Bad Precedent
<P>What is going on here? On the same day that a federal appeals court rules that the attempt by Congress to keep children from getting access to pornography on the Internet is unconstitutional, baseball owners have deprived Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott of the right to run her own baseball club for two years.
So let me understand this. It is okay to make all sorts of filthy material readily available to kids via the Internet, but the owner of a baseball team doesnt have the right to say stupid things.<P>

Far be it from me to defend the things Marge Schott has said. Most of her remarks display ignorance of history and disregard for the concept of the United States as a melting pot. But so what? Is this a crime?
Baseball owners have made it clear that Schott was disciplined, not for anything she did in connection with the management of the Reds, but because of "insensitivity." Wow! If insensitivity is a crime, some of our greatest athletic coaches will be soon out of jobs.<P>

It seems to me that the game of baseball, once known as Americas favorite pastime, has succumbed to a case of extreme political correctness. Schott has made some highly questionable remarks about Asians, for example. But no charge has been made that she discriminated against any Asian employee who might have worked for the Reds.<P>

It is quite one matter if Marge Schott were charged with discriminating against minorities who worked for her. That, after all, violates the law. But expressing her opinion? Louis Farrakhan has opinions which make me physically ill. No one, however, suggests he isnt entitled to his opinions even though they exude racial and religious hatred. So why pick on Marge Schott?<P>
If patrons are offended by what Schott says, they can boycott Cincinnati Reds games. Thats the American way. But to punish the lady by taking away her property rights because she said "insensitive" things is anything but American.<P>

I am sure that acting Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig feels good about himself now that he has exhibited this burst of political correctness. Well, he shouldnt.<P>

The precedent Selig has set may well come back to haunt him. Thats because the dictators of political correctness are always changing their standards. Who knows, maybe Selig will one day be deprived of the right to operate the Milwaukee Brewers because of something he says, which by todays standards is perfectly acceptable.<P>

As to Marge Schott, she ought to find the same ACLU lawyers who handled the Internet case. Ill bet the courts would overturn the decision of the baseball owners in a flash if they were given half a chance.<P>

<h2>"Dole Trashes his Base"
</h2>
<P>

<P>Bob Dole must have a death wish. His campaign seemed to get recharged when he announced his resignation from the Senate a few weeks ago. Last weekend he even seemed to forge a compromise on the abortion issue which everyone from Christie Todd Whitman, the liberal Governor of New Jersey, to Pat Buchanan, Doles rival for the GOP nomination, could live with. 
<P>The compromise would have retained the pro-life language in the GOP platform as it has been since 1980, but it would have included in the preamble a declaration of tolerance for opposing views on not only the abortion issue but other matters as well. It was a shrewd compromise which gave something to both sides who are deeply divided on the issue. Dole was widely praised for his leadership on the issue.
<P>No sooner had that matter been put to rest than the presumptive Presidential nominee re-opened the issue. Dole now insists that the so-called "declaration of tolerance" be included, not in the preamble, but as an amendment to the pro-life plank. That would have the effect of rendering the pro-life position of the party as meaningless. Moreover, such a declaration of tolerance wouldnt apply to other issues that divide Republicans including NAFTA and GATT to the assault weapons ban to term limits. Dole denounced Gary Bauer of the Family Research Council in ferocious terms, the likes of which he has never unleashed on Bill Clinton. 
<P>This move was taken as a declaration of war by social conservatives. Ralph Reed of the Christian Coalition, who has been very friendly to Dole throughout the primary season, told Dole in plain English that what Dole was proposing was unacceptable. Later, a spokesman for the organization suggested that if that position prevails, Christian Coalition will have to sit out the Presidential election. Christian Coalition oriented voters constitute about a quarter of the Republican vote.
<P>As if that werent bad enough. Dole, in his departing speech from the Senate which was carried live by a number of the networks, went through a litany of the programs he had helped to pass during his years in the Senate. Almost all of them were liberal programs such as food stamps and the Americans for Disabilities Act which were fought hard by conservatives. As Steve Moore of the CATO Institute put it : "Some of us have tried hard to find a reason to vote for Bob Dole. By emphasizing terrible programs that we all fought, he is just reminding us why we cant vote for him." 
<P>Indeed Doles speech had that effect among his hard core base. "It is clear that in a Dole Presidency we will get the same policies we are getting under Clinton. The difference is that there will be no resistance to those policies if they are pushed by Dole," one veteran conservative Republican pronounced. "Let him get elected with the votes of liberals," said another.
<P>But Dole wasnt content in just alienating his activist base. He went on to put distance between himself and the freshmen House Members who have been the only breath of fresh air to hit the Republican party in years. In a broadcast interview, Dole said the freshmen had gone too far in the areas of education and the environment. That caused Rep. Mark Neumann of Wisconsin to send a message to Dole: "If that is the party line, let me know and Ill go and do something else. I have no intention of running against both Bill Clinton and Bob Dole this year." Neumann, who was elected in the closest race percentage wise in the nation in 1994, said Doles comments have put him in an impossible position politically, one which cannot be sustained in his district. 
<P>The freshmen, the only group to stand up and fight for principle in Washington in recent memory, now find themselves isolated from their party standard bearer. What Dole has done is to play right into the hands of the Democrats who have denounced the freshmen as "extremist." One Dole staffer suggested that Bob Dole wouldnt be all that unhappy if some of the freshmen were defeated for re-election because then Dole wouldnt have to deal with them when he becomes President. 
<P>There is a rule in politics which is almost never violated by successful candidates for President. First, consolidate your base. Then move outward from there. Bob Dole has spent the last week carpet bombing his base. If he wins the Presidency, it is clear that Dole wants to do so without the Christian right, principled economic conservatives, or the tough minded House freshmen. A Dole Presidency under those conditions, which no doubt would be accompanied by a Democratic Congress, would produce more victories for liberalism than Bill Clinton could ever hope to deliver.  As Eric Licht, President of Coalitions for America put it, "Bill Clinton couldnt pass national health insurance, but Bob Dole could well do so." 
<P>I guess I am always open to being shown new ways to put together a winning electoral coalition. If Bob Dole can be elected President by trashing the heart of the party which nominated him, it will truly be an election for the history books. <P>

<h2>Justice Thomas Bests His Detractors
</h2>
<P>

<P>
<P>Three cheers to Justice Clarence Thomas for ignoring my advice. I talked to the Justice last Thursday (he is one of the three I dont want impeached) and suggested that he not appear at an awards ceremony in suburban Washington because it would give too much of a platform to his opponents. Instead, I suggested, he ought to have a special picnic for the eighth grade students at the Supreme Court where he would be  in control of the situation.
<P>You will recall that Justice Thomas was invited by students at the Pullen School to speak at an awards ceremony held at Central High School in Prince Georges County, Maryland. The students had invited him after meeting with him while on a tour of the Supreme Court where he was the only Justice to take the time to visit with them in his chambers.
<P>When school board member Kenneth Johnson heard about the invitation, he went ballistic. Johnson said he would disrupt the appearance if Thomas came to the ceremony. That led the school Superintendent to un-invite Thomas. The school board, however, overruled the Superintendent and re-invited Thomas. Thomas was silent about his intentions right up until the time of the event last night.
<P>Armstrong Williams, the host of "The Right Side" on radio and on NET, and I both talked with Thomas late last week and got the impression that he was seriously considering not making the event. I suggested that if he went, the lead story would be the protest against him and his message to the students would be lost. Thats why I recommended the alternative, which would be a special event just for the students and no one else. Thomas could have legally kept the protesters out of the court.
<P>In retrospect I am glad Thomas ignored my advice. The likes of Kenneth Johnson should not have been able to silence the Justice by promising disruption. In fact, Johnson was able to muster only 80 protesters who were confined to another part of the building. Johnson complained bitterly that because Thomas had hinted, through Armstrong Williams, that he might not come, Johnson couldnt get people to turn out. Maybe Thomas should be in charge of our military strategy as well!
<P>Thomas told the parents and children who, by the way, gave him standing ovations, "I deeply regret having brought some unwanted attention to this wonderful ceremony." In fairness, Thomas didnt cause the attention. His detractors did.
<P>Late last night, following the appearance of Thomas at the ceremony, I did a half hour segment of Armstrong Williams syndicated radio show. Just about every caller was against Thomas. Williams and I did battle with them. The party line against Thomas is that he is a hypocrite because he is the beneficiary of affirmative action programs and now he wants them eliminated. I dispute that theory. Read Justice Thomas opinions. They are among the most profound ever rendered by any Justice.
<P>I do not think Justice Thomas needed affirmative action to get where he is. I think he succeeded on his own merits. One caller insisted, "I dont want Justice Thomas as a role-model for my daughter." I asked him if he wanted Louis Farrakhan as a role model, since the same Kenneth Johnson who promised to disrupt a Thomas appearance sponsored a resolution before the Prince Georges County School Board which would have given teachers and students a day off to participate in the Million Man March. The caller said my point was irrelevant.
<P>There is something to the intensity of some of these callers and protesters which is beyond all reason. Maybe the Rev. Imogene Stewart, a  Black Washington civic activist who appeared on "The Right Side" last Friday, is on to something. She contends that while some in the black community cloak their opposition to Thomas in the rhetoric of affirmative action, what they are really angry about is that he married a white woman.
<P>Well, whatever it is, Thomas showed up his detractors. He proved to be a man of his word. He was gracious and self effacing. He gave the students good advice  such as "remember that good manners will open doors that the best education will not and cannot. Even though you may have strong feelings about matters, that does not give you license to have bad manners." Great advice. Kenneth Johnson can you hear what Justice Thomas said over the clatter of your own rhetoric?<P>

June 10, 1996

<h2>
Some Freshmen Have Some Problems
</h2>
<P>
<P>
<P>Ive said a fair amount over the past year and a half about the freshman class of Republicans, that eager group of legislators that swept into office in the Republican landslide year of 1994. As a group they have performed well for the nation. Unfortunately, their elders for the most part were not as eager to make the changes these freshmen felt they had a mandate to make. So the overall record of the 104th Congress is disappointing to say the least, but as a group, the freshmen are not to blame for this unfortunate fact. 
<P>As I say, taken as a group, the freshmen Republicans are an impressive lot. Individually, however, some of them have problems. There is Congressman Jon Christensen of Nebraska, whose campaign centered around family values. He wasnt in office for a year when he filed for divorce and took the unusual step of forcing his wife to file an affidavit that she had been unfaithful. She now is contesting the divorce, saying she doesnt want to break up the marriage. He says it is all over. He is in one tough race for re-election. 
<P>There is, of course, the soap opera like drama of Enid and Joe Waldholtz. Joe is on his way to the federal pen and the big question is whether or not he takes Enid with him. She has already dumped Joe and has even changed her name back to Enid Green, but she wisely chose not to run for the House again. 
<P>Then there is the very strange case of Rep. Wes Cooley of Oregon. Cooley came out of nowhere to win a state senate seat in 1992. When Rep. Bob Smith unexpectedly announced his retirement in 1994, everyone and his mother got in the race for the Republican nomination for Congress. Cooley won a seven way primary with under 30% of the vote and went on to win the rural conservative district rather handily with 57% of the vote. 
<P>Cooley is as affable a person as you would want to meet. You can well imagine him operating a country store, sitting around the cracker barrel and spinning tales. The problem for Cooley is that he is a Congressman now and people take what he says for real. 
<P>Cooley already has admitted that he lied about being married to the woman he now calls his wife. It seems that if the couple wasnt married, she could still collect widows benefits from a previous marriage. But after he got elected to the state senate, Cooley thought perhaps they ought to regularize things. He had what was called an anniversary party, but it would appear that when he was said to be renewing his vows, he was, in fact, actually getting married. We dont know for sure because Cooley has gone to the extraordinary length of having the date of his marriage kept sealed by the courts. 
<P>Cooleys biggest problem stems from his claim that he served in a special unit of the military during the Korean war. He claims that the Pentagon lost all of his records. He also claims that every single person with whom he served is now dead. The unit was a secret one, he says, so he cant disclose anything about it. When asked to at least recite some recollections from his days in the service, Cooley says his memory fails him. 
<P>Cooley blames all of his troubles on the news media and left wing opponents. Now lest you think I have taken up unsubstantiated claims by a media out to get the Oregon Congressman, consider this: Coalitions for America, a lobby organization of which I am the national chairman, holds a weekly luncheon in this building which is attended by Members of Congress and various conservative and pro-family groups. Among the attendees of this luncheon from time to time has been Rep. Wes Cooley. So when the allegations against him broke, I expected that he would want to give his side of the story. <P>
Instead, Cooley said nothing. Finally I called on him and asked him if there wasnt something he wanted to tell his colleagues and philosophical allies. He said that all of the charges against him were false and made up by his enemies. I told him that if such charges were really false that we were the sort of people who would go to bat for him, we just needed to be equipped with the facts. He promised he would supply them just as he promised he would hold press briefings to refute the charges against him. No facts were produced and no such press briefings were held. <P>
Lets be perfectly candid about it. Wes Cooley is lying. Former Rep. Bob Smith, who campaigned hard for Cooley after he won his primary, now says he is embarrassed by Cooley and has called on him to step down. Cooley says he will let the voters decide. They will indeed. His Democratic opponent now has a commanding lead in a district which is solidly conservative and Republican.<P>
The fact that Enid Green and Cooley vote right is beside the point. Members of Congress need to be role models. People in the community should be able to look up to them as prototype citizens.<P>
Enid Green at least had the decency to retire, although she should have resigned from her seat because she clearly obtained it by fraud. Cooley deceived the voters of Oregon by making exaggerated claims about his service to his country, about his education, about his marital status, and who knows what else. Cooley, having just won renomination for second term, should now step down and permit the Republican party to name some one else to take his place. By the way, in his district more people voted for others on the primary ballot than those voting to renominate Cooley.<P>
This is clearly a case where "None of the Above" or NOTA is badly needed. These conservative voters should have an additional choice between Cooley and his Democratic opponent who will vote against their wishes. They ought to have the chance to vote for "None of the Above" and void the election. But since NOTA is not on the Oregon ballot, it is now up to Cooley. Former Congressman Smith says now that he has spoken out against Cooley, no doubt Cooley will label him as part of a great conspiracy against him. Thats what Cooley told us at our lunch  that a great conspiracy was out to get him. Sorry, Congressman. The only thing that is out to get you are the lies you have told, the stories you have made up, the deceptions you have concocted. If you care at all for your country, instead of just yourself, then resign.  Resign so that your district, as conservative as it is, doesnt contribute to the possibility of the Democrats re-taking the Congress. <P>
After so many years of telling so many lies, you may believe all of your own stories, Congressman. Thats fine. Retire to your ranch where no doubt the dumb animals will give you the attention you deserve.

<h2>
Third-party Candidate Would Force the Issues
</h2>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>Former Colorado Governor Dick Lamm has announced that he is joining the Reform Party of Ross Perot and has suggested that if Perot himself does not run for President, he (Lamm) just might do so. I hope he does. Not that I could vote for the former Governor of my adopted state. His positions on some of the social issues preclude that. But Dick Lamm is one very forthright and candid fellow. 
<P>Unlike Bill Clinton and Bob Dole, Lamm is willing to frankly discuss the need to get entitlements under control. Dick Lamm doesnt mind touching the so called third rail of American politics, namely Social Security. Governor Lamm is willing to tackle the enormous problem of the trillions of dollars in unfunded mandates. Lamm will discuss, while the others will not, the effect that our crushing national debt will have on future generations. Governor Lamm is not afraid to raise the conflict of interest questions which plague both political parties. He may be wrong on some things, but he is one honest fellow. 
<P>Dick Lamm, barring some remarkable turn of events, wont be elected President if he is out there running on a third party ticket. But Dick Lamm can do an immense service to the American public by forcing the major parties to face up to the issues he raises. True, Perot has raised some of the same issues. But Perot is regarded as an eccentric. Lamm is non-threatening, yet highly articulate. He was very popular among voters in both parties when he was Governor of Colorado, even though he frequently said the unthinkable. 
<P>Numbers, charts, graphs, and even the reality of the impending bankruptcy of Medicare have not forced the major parties to face the truth. Americas debt is killing its future. But Dick Lamm, if he turns out to be the Reform Party candidate, will force the debate which America should have been having on these issues since 1960, indeed since the 1930s. 
<P>America badly needs this debate. Our future depends on it. Thats why members of all parties, regardless of philosophy, ought to be cheering on Governor Lamm. If he runs, and raises the issues the other candidates refuse to face, the entire political landscape will change. Then maybe, just maybe, the 1996 election will have a lasting impact. <P>

Virginia Primary a Test of Loyalty
</h2>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<P>A visitor from another state who might have happened upon one of Senator John Warners television commercials, aimed at voters in next Tuesdays Virginia Republican primary, would probably think that Warner is the conservative candidate. The Warner commercial talks about tradition and how proud he is to be a part of Virginias venerable conservatism. But the record of three term Senator John Warner suggests he is anything but a true blue conservative. 
<P>Warners election was a fluke. In 1978, the newly found conservative majority in the Republican party nominated the young, articulate, and very attractive party chairman Dick Obenshain for the Senate. Obenshain seemed to be on the road to victory. But Obenshain was tragically killed when his light plane crashed in the Virginia countryside, leaving the party without a nominee for the Senate at the ninth hour of the election content. John Warner, who had spent a huge amount of money in trying to win the nomination, but who was gracious in defeat and had pledged to support Obenshain, was drafted as the GOP nominee.  
<P>Warners campaign was going nowhere and the conservatives who had picked Obenshain declined to support him. My longtime friend Dick Scaife of Pittsburgh called me and asked if I would put together a meeting of conservatives with Warner. I did so on October 7th of 1978. It was a contentious meeting which lasted two and a half hours. Warner ended up pledging to vote conservative on every issue that was raised from the Equal Rights Amendment to abortion and the SALT treaty with the Soviets. Conservatives got behind Warner and he pulled off the closest senate election in Virginia history. 
<P>Warner kept most of his promises during his first term although he had to be reminded of them from time to time. When he came up for re-election in 1984, he hardly had opposition. It was during his second term that he moved to the left. He opposed, for example, Ronald Reagans nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court. On many crucial votes, he could be counted on by the liberals if they needed him. When he won his third term in 1990, nearly unopposed, he decided to go the distance. Up to that point, Warner had pretty much stayed out of Republican politics in the state of Virginia. 
<P>Looking at himself as invincible, the onetime husband of actress Elizabeth Taylor, waded in knee deep. When conservatives prevailed and nominated home school association executive Mike Ferris as their candidate for Lt. Governor, Warner refused to support him. Ferris lost narrowly to Don Beyer, the man who will be the Democratic standard bearer for Governor next year. 
<P>Then when some conservatives put forth the candidacy of Oliver North for the Senate against Senator Chuck Robb, Warner backed Norths intra-party rival, former Reagan budget director Jim Miller. Miller lost narrowly to North. So Warner went out and recruited former Virginia Attorney General Marshall Coleman to run as an Independent. Coleman drew just enough votes away from North to send Chuck Robb back to the Senate for another six years. So Miller, who had enjoyed Warners support in 1994, decided that was too much for him and declared his candidacy against Warner.
<P>Warners incumbency has drawn big bucks and Miller has not had the funds to run an aggressive campaign. Still, many conservatives are very bitter about Warners betrayal of their candidates. Republican National Committeeman Morton Blackwell, just overwhelmingly re-elected to a third term to that post last week-end at a state convention, said that if the Republicans re-nominate Warner, "we ought to take up a collection and erect, on Monument Avenue in Richmond, a statue of Benedict Arnold." 
<P>Warner, for his part, is openly courting Democrats to vote for him in the primary. Virginia has no party registration so anyone may vote in this primary. Polls show Warner ahead by a large margin but the Warner folks are worried. Moral indignation against Warner runs so high among activists that if they turn out and Warner supporters take his election for granted, Miller just might pull an upset.
<P>Miller is a solid down the line conservative but a colorless campaigner who has failed to excite people. Warner enjoys so much support among Democrats, that the Democratic nominee for the Senate, Mark Warner (no relation) is given no chance to win. 
<P>Still the contest in Virginia boils down to this: in this last half of the last decade of the 20th Century, is loyalty still a virtue?  Many Republicans say that Warner turned his back on them and his party and he has no right now to turn to them to seek another term in the Senate. When the votes are counted on Tuesday, it will be known if dancing with the girl who brought you to the party is still in vogue or if Republicans prefer someone who is more loyal to the Democrats and to himself than to the party whose label he reluctantly wears.<P>

<h2>
Qualifying Welfare Reform
</h2>
<P>
Guest Commentary by Rep Mark Neuman<P>

<P>This week in the House, a very important issue will be debated about a welfare reform plan known as W-2 Wisconsin Works.  
<P>While this plan is certainly about welfare reform, it is also about a much bigger, perhaps much more important issue.  Its about taking power out of the hands of Washington bureaucrats and giving it back to the people.  It is about whether you control what goes on in your state, or whether the Washington bureaucrats will micro-manage every facet of your lives.  When the House passes this bill this week, we take the first major step toward saying "no" to Big Government and federal bureaucrats and saying "yes" putting power back in the hands of the people.
<P>Governor Tommy Thompson of my state has written a welfare reform plan which, I believe, could easily serve as a model for all states to follow.  
<P>This plan was debated for 18 months in Wisconsin.  It was the subject of countless public hearings and meetings.  And then it was overwhelmingly endorsed and passed by both Houses of the Wisconsin legislature  with bipartisan support  both Democrats and Republicans put their stamp of approval on this welfare reform plan.  
<P>But now, many inside the beltway want Washington bureaucrats to tear it apart.  
<P>Washington bureaucrats have grabbed so much power from the states recently,  that Wisconsin needs federal approval before the plan is allowed to be implemented.  That is why I have introduced legislation in the House that allows this plan, which President Clinton himself called "one of the boldest yet," to be put into action in Wisconsin.
<P>While I believe Governor Thompsons welfare reform plan is an excellent one, my legislation doesnt force any other state to adopt it.  It simply clears the way for Wisconsin to move ahead with its own welfare reforms.  
<P>This welfare reform plan was researched, written, debated and passed into law by the citizens of Wisconsin and their elected representatives.  It underwent the scrutiny of numerous public hearings and 18 months of public debate.  And as I mentioned, it was overwhelmingly passed with bipartisan support in the Wisconsin legislature.  
<P>Each House passed it with at least a two-thirds vote.  Further, Governor Thompsons welfare reform plan was enthusiastically endorsed by President Clinton in his weekly radio address just three weeks ago.
<P>But as I said, regardless of the merits of this bill, this legislation represents a much bigger issue: and that is the issue of returning power back to you  the people.
<P>When I came to this Congress in 1995  along with 72 other freshmen  we had two very specific goals in mind: 
<ul>
<LI>balance the budget; 
<LI>and reduce the size, scope, power and influence of the federal government. 
</ul>
<P>We were given a mandate from the people to get Washington off their backs and reduce the burdens and regulations Washington routinely imposes upon them.  My constituents are tired of mandates from Washington; they are fed up with the massive tax burden; and they are sick of Washingtons wasteful spending habits that put their children and grandchildren further and further into debt.  
<P>But this freshmen class is changing the way Washington works.  As I mentioned several weeks ago on this program, we are making great strides in balancing the budget and reducing wasteful Washington spending.  And this week the Senate takes another try at passing a constitutional amendment to balance the federal budget  a measure which I wholeheartedly support.
<P>And now, with the legislation I have introduced this week, this Congress is taking a very important step in taking power and  influence out of the hands of Washington bureaucrats and returning it to you, the people who sent us here.  
<P>Some would have you believe that only the folks in Washington can have a monopoly on compassion.  Only they can truly see what the people out in the country really need.  Only Washington bureaucrats are fit to determine the needs of the people in Wisconsin and elsewhere.
<P>Folks, thats just silly.  Governor Thompson, along with a bipartisan effort of both Democrats and Republicans in Wisconsin approved this welfare reform plan.  They know what is best for the people they represent, not the bureaucrats in Washington who never have to face the consequences of regulations they impose.  
<P>But now the Washington bureaucrats cant stand not having their fingerprints on this welfare reform plan.  They want to review every detail.  They want to prescribe for you and for me what is best for us.
<P>This issue of welfare reform, perhaps more than any other, demonstrates the need to strip Washington of the immense power it now holds.   
<P>When we pass this welfare reform measure, it will open the door for other states to say "no" to mandates from Washington and "yes" to the wishes of the citizens. <P>

An Old Dog Learns New Tricks
</h2>
<P>
<P>An Old Dog Learns New Tricks
<P>Ever since Bob Dole became Senate Majority Leader in 1985 I have had a running argument with him. I often told Dole to bring measures to the floor of the Senate for a vote, regardless of whether or not you have enough Senators willing to pass the bills. By losing, you win. Those votes would reveal the liberals for what they are and help elect more conservatives to the Senate.<P>
Dole disagreed. He didnt want to vote on anything unless he thought he had the votes to pass it. That is why he and his chief of staff Sheila Burke always sought the lowest common denominator legislation. The less controversial, the better the chance to rack up a big win. Of course, the less controversial, the less chance of accomplishing anything with the legislation. Historic opportunities were lost in many fields because the legislation Dole usually got passed was so bipartisan that it demonstrated no differences between the parties. I argued that without this contrast, voters would have no incentive to add to Doles ranks. He never seemed to get it, that is, until now.<P>
There is a great irony in the way Bob Dole will finish out his last week as the Senate Republican Leader. He will bring up measures, including the Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution, which have no chance of passage. In doing so, Dole will be trying to get across to the American voters some of the main differences between the parties. Dole has dared President Clinton to help get the last two votes needed to pass the Balanced Budget Amendment through the Senate. However, the President opposes the Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution. <P>
Who says you cant teach an old dog new tricks? Dole now seems to understand, albeit during the last moments of his Senate Leadership, that you can win by losing. I honestly believe, had this been done more of the time, with thorough preparation and lots of prolonged debate, the public would finally see who was on which side of the different debates and would act accordingly at the next election. The fact that meaningless bipartisan, vanilla legislation would pass the Senate by big margins only served to confuse the electorate. All sides could take credit for almost nothing. No wonder so many incumbents were re-elected. <P>
Now at the eleventh hour Dole is going to lose in the Senate in a very high profile way. But in losing he may gain points with the American voter.<P>
Although Dole has seemed to learn something new at this last moment, in some things he is sticking to the past. Chief of Staff Sheila Burke, it seems, may end up in the Dole campaign after all. <P>
Some, such as American Conservative Union Chairman David Keene, say this just proves Bob Dole is loyal to his friends. Perhaps. I think it proves that Bob Dole does not believe he can get along without Sheila Burke after having become so dependent on her over these last few years. Keene says that Sheila Burke never pursued her own agenda, but rather she served Bob Dole by doing exactly what he wanted done. If that is the case, then Dole is, indeed, a lot more liberal than his voting record suggests. <P>
At any rate, we will soon learn the truth. Since Doles announced resignation from the Senate, the Dole campaign seems to have found new life and has begun to develop a consistent message. If Sheila Burke is truly the team player her defenders claim she is, she will go along with all of it and blend right in. Then Sheila, old Senate dog that she is, will have learned new tricks too. <P>
On the other hand, if Sheila behaves as she has over the past years in Doles office, she will begin to impose herself on various aspects of the campaign. If you read news accounts about how Burke is trying to get the Republican platform liberalized, then you will understand that it is the same old Sheila at work. And if David Keene is correct, she will be doing so at Doles bidding. <P>
Im encouraged that Dole has finally caught on to how you can win in the long run by losing in the short run. Now lets see if his new found wisdom rubs off on Sheila. Hope springs eternal, as the saying goes. <P>

Phony Jurist Takes Reporters for a Ride
</h2>
<P>
<P>On Friday morning I was driving to the NET offices when ABC radio news, at 9 a.m. Eastern, broadcast that one of the jurors in the Whitewater case in Little Rock had said she had read about the defendants before the trial and had a negative impression of them. What happened at the trial confirmed that view.<P>
I was stunned. If that statement were true, it meant big time trouble for prosecutor Ken Starr. Subsequently I heard the same story on another radio network and on CNN. I asked a couple of attorneys for their opinion and they told me that if such a juror had indeed come forward, it meant that the defense had solid grounds to get the convictions overturned.<P>
As viewers of "Paul Talk" know, we discussed this story on the show. Others had heard the same story and called in to ask questions. One viewer raised the possibility that perhaps this had been a planted juror  not an unreasonable suggestion under the circumstances. As I answered the questions I was thinking that the Clintons must be the luckiest people on the face of the earth and such a development, if true, could effect the plans of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr to move forward on other cases.<P>
Friday night I was preoccupied with the wedding rehearsal dinner of my son, Steve, so I really didnt  pay close attention to newscasts, although I did hear one or two. On early Saturday morning when our two Washington papers arrived, I expected to see this story on the front page. Perhaps it would be a banner headline in the Washington Post. I was puzzled when I saw nothing about it but the wedding was a few hours away and our household was preoccupied with other thoughts. Again, with the reception going on into late evening, I didnt pay much attention to newscasts.<P>
When the Sunday papers arrived and I saw nothing of this story I knew there was something wrong. The Post, as a matter of fact, ran a four page spread, not including the beginning of the story on page one, to the effect that Hillary Clinton may now be in real trouble because her public statements do not match the facts in the Whitewater case. I dont remember pages of coverage like this in the Post since Watergate.<P>
In any case, I began to search for the story of what happened to the juror. I listened to radio newscasts. I heard nothing. Finally, after church and before leaving home for a graduation party, there was the story on CNNs Headline News, almost all the way through the news segment.<P>
It seems that the prejudicial statement which had been printed in the newspapers about the Whitewater trial was made not by an actual juror but by a woman of the same name as one of the jurors. The media kept hounding this woman, insisting that she was the real juror, despite her protestations that she was not. Finally, she became annoyed that they didnt believe her and she decided to go along with their demands for a statement. That was when she said what was quoted on the various newscasts which I had heard. <P>
In short, the so called mainstream media had been had. I picked up my information from them which resulted in my comments on Fridays show. I did add the caveat that my predictions would be true IF the woman had been quoted accurately. Nevertheless, I accepted as true what they had broadcast. So my apologies to all the viewers of "Direct Line" who went about their week-end thinking that the Whitewater convictions would be overturned and that even Governor Tucker might not resign the governorship of Arkansas after all.<P>
What of the responsibility of the networks, who promoted this story, to broadcast the fact that they had been had on their same newscasts? Although I was preoccupied, I did hear several newscasts on Saturday as we were going to and from the church and the reception and back home. But I heard not a word about this from the same news organizations which had made the story a big deal the day before.<P>
What of the newspapers which were giving extensive coverage to Whitewater? Why was there not a word that the electronic media had been taken? An attorney I discussed this case with at last nights graduation party told me that the real juror would probably have a good slander case against the media which broadcast information, damaging to her reputation, when they were quoting someone else. The real juror, so far as I know, has made no comment. Maybe she is busy talking to her lawyers.<P>
Someone ought to hold the broadcast news organizations accountable for what they did. That includes NET. None of us checked ourselves to determine if, in fact, a juror had made this statement before we broadcast it. It was the height of irresponsibility for them to have broadcast what they did and it was, frankly, irresponsible of me to have just repeated it without a call to Ken Starrs office to verify the story. The only thing I can say in our defense is that we dont have the huge news departments that the other networks have, and I, unfortunately, have almost no time to prepare for my show since I do this as a sideline, second to my duties as the CEO of NET as well as the CEO of the Free Congress Foundation.<P>
I hope all of us involved have learned a lesson about old fashioned journalism. Verify your story before airing it. I should not have assumed that because I had heard the story on three networks it was gospel. For that I profoundly apologize to my viewers. You deserved better. And all I can promise is that I will do my best to see that we dont repeat the same mistake again. Thats all for Direct Line for tonight.<P>

"Elite Hits Justice Thomas Again"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<p>

<P>Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas was invited to speak next month at the Thomas G. Pullen Creative and Performing Arts School in Maryland.  This week, school officials say they have now "uninvited" Justice Thomas.  They have told him not to address the schools June 10 awards ceremony. The reason: because of  threats of a protest.
<P>``Several parents and other community members ... expressed their concern about a possible visit by Justice Thomas and in fact, threatened to stage some kind of protest, Chris Cason, a spokesman for the Prince Georges County school system in suburban Maryland, said Wednesday.
<P>In short, Maryland school officials have told a member of the United States Supreme Court he is suddenly no longer welcome at their event because the school system is now worried about even the threat of a protest from several people.  What the leaders of this school system have done is shameful. They have dishonored their original commitment to Justice Thomas and by doing so they have dishonored themselves as well as the school system they are supposed to represent. They have chosen to cower to threats of a few rather than stand on the principle of their original commitment.
<P>The action by Marylands Prince Georges County school system sends a chilling message to students. In effect what the school system says by this is that children must heed the bullying threats of the few in order to get along. It says children must put aside doing what is right in favor of doing what is safe. The action signals to children that freedom of speech for the many can be shouted down even by the threatened protest of an elite few.
<P>Of course, it is no accident that the uninvited Justice is Clarence Thomas, who is, by the way, one the most principled jurists ever named to the bench.  You see, unlike the leaders of this Maryland school district, Justice Thomas is not politically correct. His actions are not dictated by the threats of the radical few. In decision after decision on the bench, he has proven an unwavering loyalty to one thing: the United States Constitution. Because of that, almost daily, Justice Thomas is pummeled by the liberal media which hates the idea of a black conservative holding a such a powerful position.
<P>But theres one thing in particular that Justice Thomas has going for him: he doesnt care what they think. In a meeting several months with liberal reporters who complained about his position on the issues, Justice Thomas told them, "Im here to stay. Deal with it!"
<P>Deal with it. The character of Justice Clarence Thomas has been horribly and ignobly assassinated by the establishment elite and yet this man lives.
<P>The action of the Prince Georges County, Maryland, school system proves one thing: there are two kinds of public officials: those who cower before the shrill of an elite few and those who act according to principle. Pity the students: the former have defrauded these children the right to hear the latter.<P>

"the Jury Did Not Believe the President"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<p>
<P>Last Week, President Clinton went into a tirade before the cameras, accusing Bob Dole of raising the character issue.  Over the weekend President Clinton was busy down-playing the active duty military defense his attorneys want to use against the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit.  Yesterday President Clinton went before the cameras to remind the voters that he was not on trial in Arkansas.  Bob Dole need not utter a word about it. With each action, President Clintons character is becoming his own third rail.
<P>Before convicting Susan McDougal, her former husband James McDougal and Arkansas Governor Jim Guy Tucker, the jury in the Whitewater trial heard taped testimony from President Clinton.  It is extraordinary for a sitting president to testify in such a trial.  That testimony was critical to the defense.  The McDougals were former partners of Bill and Hillary Clinton.  At the very least, the presidents testimony ought to have led to the acquittal of Susan McDougal.  Instead the jury returned 24 guilty verdicts against the each of the defendants.  The president testified and yet the jury did not believe him.
<P>Were told jury members even prayed before reaching their decision. With yesterdays conviction, Arkansas Governor Jim Guy Tucker  a Democrat  said he will resign by mid July.  In doing so, he chose not to try and run the state from the "big house" but instead to surrender his post to Lt. Governor Mike Huckabee  a Republican.  That conviction and subsequent resignation alone breaths new life into an issue which has dogged this Administration since the beginning.  After all, the president testified, and the jury did not believe him.
<P>Now the voters will see Whitewater as a warning to check the White House silverware.  Now the Congress will see Whitewater as a green light to pursue its own investigations with little risk of finger pointing over partisanship.  Now reporters will see Whitewater as an opportunity to compete for the Pulitzer prize.  But more than anything else, yesterdays Whitewater convictions give instant credibility to the efforts of special prosecutor Kenneth Starr. Why? Because the president testified and the jury did not believe him.
<P>Now Starr will be free turn his attention to the one most vulnerable figure in this case  first lady Hillary Clinton. Already a compelling question is being asked in the minds of those familiar with this case.  It is a question establishment players may find too indelicate to ask. So Ill ask it.  Did Hillary Clinton perjure herself?  Now, mind you, that is not a question for Bob Dole to ask.  Whitewater is not an issue to mingle with a presidential race designed to run on issues.  If Whitewater does prove the undoing of President Clinton, it will happen because of Bob Doles obvious silence than were he and his campaign to attempt to force the issue. Now Dole can boldly proclaim real issues without ever mentioning Whitewater. All because the president testified and the jury did not believe him.

"Clinton Should Stay Out of Foreign Elections"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
<P>
By this time tomorrow we may know the projected winner in the Israeli elections. 
<P>By all measures, the contest will be determined by a razor-thin margin. The choice for Prime Minister is between the incumbent Shimon Peres and the challenger Benjamin Netanyahu. But in a sense, it is a contest between the old political order and a new order where the outcome depends largely on teenagers voting for the first time and refugees from the former Soviet Union who are also participating in their first Israeli election. 
<P>It has been an interesting roller coaster of an election. Netanyahu was chosen by the opposition Likud bloc last year and immediately began to challenge the so called peace process supported by the late Prime Minister Yitzak Rabin. Netanyahu jumped to a substantial lead in the polls and there was talk that Rabin was finished politically. Indeed the rally at which Rabin was shot was being held to drum up political support for the sagging fortunes of Rabin. 
<P>When Foreign Minister Shimon Peres took over from Rabin and the media tried to blame Netanyahu for creating the climate which led to Rabins death, Peres took what seemed to be an insurmountable lead in the polls. But Arab terrorist attacks and the ineffective Israeli response to them has permitted Netanyahu to climb back, inch by inch, to the point that he is now in a statistical dead heat with Peres and may even be slightly ahead with only 2% of the vote still undecided. 
<P>The outcome in this election will have an impact here in Washington. Throughout our history, we have always had our favorites in foreign elections. Hints were dropped here and there about what Washington thought and there were subtle moves to indicate our preference. But this time, President Bill Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, and other Administration officials have gone full tilt for Peres. At the moment polls showed the election tightening, Clinton called a hastily improvised summit meeting with Peres which was nothing more than a photo opportunity for the commercials which are now running on Israeli television. Of course promises of more foreign aid to Israel were suggested, IF Peres is re-elected. 
<P>The Clinton Administration in word and deed has left no stone unturned in its effort to influence the Israeli voters who know full well that there would be no Israel at all were it not for America. They also know how dependent Israel is on American economic aid so when "big brother" says he wants Peres, it is politically significant. But it may have backfired on Clinton and if so, the price to be paid will be high. 
<P>I had discussions with Netanyahu some years ago when he served in Washington. He is one tough customer. In fact, he may be the bluntest politician running for any office anywhere in the world. He would have no hesitancy in facing down Clinton and company the way he has faced down all of his domestic political enemies, which are many. 
<P>The Arabs, who have found common ground with Peres, would find that they had quite another kind of politician to deal with if Netanyahu wins. The Arabs who are eligible to vote in the Israeli elections are backing Peres nearly unanimously. 
<P>Directly interfering in a foreign election is not only a big gamble, it goes against the democratic principles we claim we espouse. This is an election for the citizens of Israel to decide, not for Washington to dictate.
<P>The United States is also intervening similarly in the Russian elections where we have done everything but carry the suitcases for Boris Yeltsin. Indeed our involvement has become one of the principal issues in the elections. Gregory Yavilinsky, who is the one candidate who comes closest to professing the democratic and free market ideals we claim to stand for, is outraged because until the United States and its Western partner intervened massively for Yeltsin, he was thought to have a shot at the election. That intervention, done at the taxpayers expense, may have propped up Yeltsin but it has also played right into the hand of the leading candidate, Gennady Zyuganov, whose main issue is that a plot on the part of the West caused the Soviet Union to collapse and thus it must be restored. 
<P>Bill Clinton has proved to be a masterful politician when it comes to handling the Republican Congress. With the media as his ally, he seems to be galloping to a second term and perhaps taking the Congress with him. His opponents claim he is guilty of deception and political manipulation. Be that as it may, Bill Clinton ought to stick to campaigning in this country. His overt intervention in foreign elections is dangerous either way those elections go. 
<P>Bill Clinton and company are big supporters of the New World Order so they see it as their duty to intervene. But the American taxpayers have no such obligation and through our elected officials in Congress we ought to demand that this worldwide manipulation of the democratic process be stopped before it drags us headlong into another world war.<P>

"God Is the Answer for the 21st Century"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>

<P>

<P>On this Memorial Day we remember those who have given their lives so that America may remain a free and independent nation. That question  whether we will remain a free and independent nation  as relevant at the close of what has been called the American Century as it was at the beginning of this Century. Only now the threat to Americas future is not coming from an ancient European order, nor Hitlers National Socialists, nor the evil empire of Communism. The external threat comes from Moslem fundamentalists who wish to destroy the concept of the nation state, the Chinese and Japanese military/commercial complex which seeks to overrun the rest of the world by economic invasion, as well as from the United Nations which seeks to destroy the concept of sovereignty.
<P>As we pray for those who have served their country well this past Century and before, let us call to mind those who assisted their country in unpopular causes. As painful as it was for the families whose loved ones were killed in the Great World Wars, they nevertheless had the esteem of the community because a member of their family was killed in pursuit of what was believed to be a great cause by the populace. 
<P>Pity those families who had loved ones killed in Vietnam, or who served America silently in the Cold War. There was little community comfort for those killed in the unpopular Vietnam war and as to the cold war, its many victims remain largely unknown because they served as silent agents of America in this undeclared conflict.
<P>And while we are at it, let us call to mind those who now serve their nation in unpopular locations from Bosnia to Macedonia to Haiti. Some will not return and because these conflicts lack popular support back home, the families involved will not enjoy the sort of support from mediating institutions which was forthcoming during the World Wars or even the Korean conflict. 
<P>This dark Century is ending with many of the names and locations with which the 20th Century began. We have by no means fought the wars which ended all wars. Indeed there are a record number of conflicts worldwide, many of them brutal civil wars where there seem to be no good guys or bad guys or even any rational cause at stake. 
<P>For the deaths of those Americans we commemorate on this day not to have been in vain, this nation must get back to the understanding that there will be no peace without a change in mens hearts, and there will be no change in mens hearts without God. As we head toward the 21st Century, mans synergistic co-operation with God will alone bring the tranquillity and order we all seek. If only God will grant our leaders the wisdom to understand that reality.<P>

"Why Clinton is Winning in the Polls"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>


<P>Remember those grade school stories of long ago about George Washington telling his father, "I cannot tell a lie. I chopped down the cherry tree," or Abraham Lincoln reading books by the light of the fire in his familys log cabin?
<P>Well if the latest ABC News/Washington Post poll is correct, you can forget all of that. 
<P>When asked if having someone of sound moral character was important in electing a President, only 22% of the respondents said yes. When asked if having a President who understood the problems of people like you was the most important factor in choosing a President, 77% responded in the affirmative.
<P>No wonder Bill Clinton is killing his rivals in the polls. In the same survey, 57% said he deserved another term in the White House. 
<P>The American people now want a President who feels their pain, not a President who has the strength of character to lead the nation. I guess that is why Bill Clinton will get by with asking that the Paula Jones lawsuit be delayed because he is Commander-in-Chief and thus is eligible to invoke a law passed at the time of World War II.  The law Bill Clinton is hiding behind was aimed at preventing a GI in a fox hole from being sued because he didnt send a payment for an appliance on time. 
<P>At a time when Admiral Boorda supposedly killed himself to avoid shame, Bill Clinton has no shame and the public thinks it is great. I guess if their President has no standards, they can excuse their own behavior somehow.  
<P>If moral character means next to nothing to Americans then no wonder Bill Clinton is Americas favorite. 
<P>Bill Clinton does tell people what they want to hear. He is for the gas tax repeal. He is for Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompsons welfare plan. He is for the bill to permit states to ban same sex marriages. He is for the balanced budget. He supports all the things the rest of us do. Never mind that his Administration has been in the opposite camp on all these issues. He passed the gas tax he now seeks to repeal. He vetoed the same sort of welfare reform Thompson has initiated. His administration has been in the forefront of supporting the homosexual agenda. He has vetoed the balanced budget. But reality doesnt matter. As long as Clinton says the right things, never mind what he does. 
<P>Yes, Bill Clinton is obviously the right man for these times. Times when apparently honesty and truth and integrity and morality take a distant second place to feeling good. One thing Bill Clinton can do better than anyone else, no matter how bad things really are, is make us feel good. Chelsea is such a lucky kid to have a father like Bill.
<P>

"A Call for Impeachment of the Six Justices"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>

<P>In the history of nations, there comes a time when a crossroads is reached. Down one road is the slippery slope to perdition. It is the easier road, but at its end civilization lies in ruins and historians are left to chronicle the demise. Up the other road is the narrow, difficult path to the recovery of sovereignty of the people. The latter road is fraught with peril and many turn back along the way. But for those who make it, the possibility of passing on the heritage of the nation is made possible. 
<P>I believe we have reached such a crossroads with the Supreme Courts decision this week which struck down Amendment Two of the Colorado Constitution. This sweeping declaration by the Court is now being celebrated, if you will pardon the term, with gay abandon by those in the society who seek to undue all civilized restraints. It will take us down the road to the ultimate destruction of our society. 
<P>Again the Court has invented a new right under the Constitution which was never contemplated by the Founding Fathers. It was never given to the Court by any vote of the legislature or referendum of the people. The Supreme Court has now struck down, it would seem for all time, the one weapon citizens thought they had to preserve their society  the vote of the people.<P>
The issue was simple enough. The people of Colorado voted to instruct their own legislative bodies not to give special rights to homosexuals. No rights were taken away. Only rights not enjoyed by other groups in society were enjoined. <P>
The state of Colorado presented several arguments to meet the reasonableness test which the Court imposes in consideration of such issues. But six Supreme Court Justices rejected all those arguments and told the people of Colorado: You have lied to us. We here know that the reason you voted as you did is because you are bigoted against homosexuals. So we will thwart your will. We will void your sovereignty. We, the elite, will overturn your decision and we will open the door to anyone who feels he has been defeated by the democratic process to seek our protection from the people. <P>
The Justices said that the Colorado amendment "imposes a special disability upon (homosexual) persons alone. Homosexuals are forbidden the safeguards that others enjoy or may seek without constraint." But as an editorial in the Chicago Tribune suggests, "The inflated rhetoric masks analytical weakness. All the amendment says is that gays cant obtain civil rights protection without amending the state constitution, which they are free to attempt. They are at no more of a disadvantage than any other group adversely affected by their state constitution."<P>
This same Court, not a decade ago, said that it was constitutional to criminalize the behavior of homosexuals. They can be arrested and jailed for what they do, but the rest of us can be jailed for trying to prevent them from having special rights and protections not enjoyed by other groups of citizens. <P>
This is only the beginning, as various homosexual rights groups gleefully proclaim. This decision paves the way for the complete acceptance and sanction by this society of a lifestyle which is openly condemned in the Bible more times than any other specific sin. "An abomination unto the Lord" can now receive privileged treatment from legislative bodies. If this decision is allowed to stand, historians will look back upon this time as the critical turning point in our society. <P>
What is to be done? In the past I would have exhorted you to elect a President who would change the High Court by the appointment Justices who would adhere to the Constitution. That was the cry of Richard Nixon in the 1968 Presidential election. Nixon effected no such change. Nor, as it turned out, did Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, George Bush, or, of course, Bill Clinton. Each of them contributed Justices who constituted the 6 to 3 majority of the Court on the Colorado decision.<P>
It is clear that no matter who we elect to the Congress and no matter what protective statutes they pass, this Court will declare them unconstitutional. The Marriage Protection Act is making its way through the Congress right now. By the standard of this Court, declaring that homosexuals cant marry constitutes bigotry. It is also clear that a vote of the people in the so-called sovereign states means nothing to this Court as it demonstrated in this case as well as in the recent case on term limits.<P>
There remains but one option for citizens who wish to protect themselves from the tyranny of the majority on this Supreme Court: impeachment.<P>
It is not a course I recommend lightly. In the early 1960s when the John Birch Society was pushing to impeach Earl Warren, I didnt buy into the idea even though I detested the decisions of the Warren court. There were many other remedies available, or so I thought, such as electing the right kind of President. In the mid 1960s when then Congressman Gerald Ford first raised the possibility of impeaching Justice William O. Douglas, I opposed the idea in a radio editorial even though I found Douglas and his views reprehensible. But this time it is different. We are out of remedies. Impeachment is our only hope of bringing a Court which is out of control, back under control. <P>
I would remind you that Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist paper number 81, wrote of the "important constitutional check which the power of instituting impeachment would give to (Congress) upon members of the judicial department."  Hamilton said, "This is alone a complete security. There can never be danger that the judges, by a series of deliberate usurpation on the authority of the legislature, would hazard the united resentment of the body entrusted with it."<P>
Indeed, the National Legal Foundation has compiled a history of impeachment which shows that in the early part of our nations history, the legislature was far more ready to act upon impeachment of judges, even a Justice of the Supreme Court, than we are today. That time was closer to the intent of our founding fathers. <P>
To the argument that impeachment can only be initiated for matters such as embezzlement or bribery, let me cite what then Minority Leader Gerald Ford said in 1970 during his drive to impeach Justice Douglas:  "What, then, is an impeachable offense? The only honest answer is that an impeachable offense is whatever a majority of the House of Representatives considers it to be at a given moment in history; conviction results from whatever offense or offenses two thirds of the other body considers to be sufficiently serious to require removal of the accused from office." As Justice Felix Frankfurter wrote in his opinion in Rochin vs. California, justices who do not restrain themselves are subject to only two remedies. A constitutional amendment or impeachment. <P>
I understand the implications of what I am recommending. I have no illusions that the Senate would remove these Justices from office. But the mere act of initiating impeachment would finally focus the attention of this nation on the enormity of the crimes which this Court has committed against our constitutional form of government.<P>
Rather than stand aside and watch this nation slide further down the path to ultimate destruction, I hope and I pray that citizens will petition their Representatives to impeach the majority of this court and in doing so, will employ the one remaining remedy they have to save the nation. Thats all for Direct Line for tonight. <P>

"Doles Bold Move"
</h2>
</center>

<P>


<P>
<P>
<P>
"Doles Bold Move"
<P>
I thought I would wait until the dust settled a bit before commenting on Senate Majority Leader Bob Doles gamble to resign and run without office for the Presidency. That I was surprised by this development is an understatement. That Sheila Burke was not one of the five people in the world who knew several weeks ahead of time that Dole was going to do this, is the best element of all. It demonstrated that at last Dole had shed his emotional dependence on Burke, which is a positive development. <P>
Dole demonstrated that it is possible to teach an old political dog new tricks. Most of us who thought we knew him well did not believe he had it in him to pull this off. After all, even if he lost the Presidency, Dole still would have been the Republican Leader. Although there was brave talk about running someone against him, when it came to the moment of truth, he probably would have remained Republican Leader for another two years. <P>
The Dole move probably means that Senate Majority Whip Trent Lott becomes Majority Leader. He will likely prove to be a far more energetic and able Leader than Dole and that has boosted the morale of the Republican Senators. So giving all of this up to go after the big prize indeed was a stunning development, at least in Washington. In the rest of the nation, it was not greeted as such a remarkable event because the rest of the nation is sensibly not as caught up in politics as Washington. <P>
The Dole move did have an effect on his campaign. It gave his troops new hope that he could win, which is something he badly needed to do. It afforded him a new opportunity to redefine himself. Up to now, to the extent that anyone knew anything about Bob Dole, it was that he was the consummate Washington Insider, not exactly a compliment these days. The Dole move represents a break with the past, even though stunned Democrats bitterly complain that Dole cant shed 36 years of Congressional service just like that. <P>
Now comes the hard part. Without the advantages that being Senate Majority Leader gave him to generate headlines, Dole must distinguish himself boldly from President Bill Clinton. Can Dole, who supports Clinton on Bosnia and China really distinguish himself from Clinton on foreign policy? Can Dole, who is no stranger to tax increases, really be credible in calling for a tax rate reduction? Can Dole, who voted for almost all of Bill Clintons judicial appointments, really come down hard on the sort of judges Bill Clinton has appointed? <P>
The Dole camp has maintained that this election would be about character and integrity. Unfortunately for Dole, all of the latest polls show that the public, by a large margin, actually believes Bill Clinton is more honest and has greater integrity than Bob Dole. That is probably the most remarkable development of this campaign. If someone like Bill Clinton, who has made a career out of dissembling, can sell honesty and integrity to the American public, Bob Dole had better hope that he can distinguish himself from Clinton on issues.<P>
Clinton is not helping Dole in any way. Dole was about to deliver a speech on welfare reform and the Clinton folks heard about it. Clinton rushed to embrace the welfare reform model proposed by Wisconsin Republican Governor Tommy Thompson. Republican Governors were outraged, but Bill Clinton got on the scoreboard first. <P>
A  Washington Times cartoon showed Clinton in the form of a parrot in a cage next to a radio. On the radio was news of Doles impending speech on welfare reform. The Clinton-like parrot squawked "Welfare reform. Bawk. Welfare reform." That is about the size of it but Clinton has done it well. <P>
The truth is that the Republican Congress sent the President two versions of welfare reform, both of which he had praised at one point. Clinton vetoed both. <P>
Therein lies the one hook that Dole has on Clinton and one which could prove to be decisive in this campaign. The President says one thing and does the opposite. Voters may think they trust Bill Clinton right now. They may think he agrees with them on the issues. But if Dole can pound home the truth that Bill Clinton is, in a sea of Washington hypocrisy, the biggest fish of them all, then Dole may actually have an effective weapon against the President. <P>
Voters, at the end of the day, dislike hypocrisy more than anything else. It remains to be seen if Dole can be bold enough, after this very bold restart to his campaign, to carry that issue to the finish line. <P>

"Preempting the FDA Power Grab"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>


<P>
<P>

<P>
I am not a chess player but it seems to me that Philip Morris has dealt a rather decisive blow to the plan of food and drug czar David Kessler to assert jurisdiction over the tobacco industry. <P>
Philip Morris has announced that it will seek federal legislation to make it a crime to sell tobacco to kids under age 18. Vending machines would be banished. Sale of single cigarettes would also be forbidden. Sampling would not be permitted except in areas where minors are denied access. Retailers would have to certify that they and their employees will enforce the law. <P>
The plan would also ban tobacco products from T-shirts and hats. There would be tobacco free zones where advertising tobacco products would not be permitted. No advertising would be allowed in any transit vehicle or in terminals. Tobacco products could not sponsor any sporting event where there is a significant youthful audience. <P>
Philip Morris Vice President Steve Parrish challenged President Clinton to support this legislation and to drop what Parrish calls the unconstitutional efforts of the FDA to assert jurisdiction over tobacco products. The President can avoid years of costly litigation, Parrish said, by getting on board this legislation and getting the FDA to drop its rule making procedure. Now, clearly, we will see if President Clinton wants to do something about the problem of teenage smoking or if he just wants to expand the power of one of his favorite government agencies. <P>
As commendable as the Philip Morris initiative is, still it federalizes a matter which ought to be left up to the states. But even if the states were to adopt all of the suggestions of the Institute of Medicine, whose recommendations Philip Morris followed in coming up with their legislation, there is still no substitute for parental guidance and parental example. <P>
If adults are really concerned about teenage smoking, they ought to take it seriously when they learn that their children are smoking. They ought to stop smoking themselves. Laws, especially federal laws, are no substitute for parental responsibility. <P>
While we would rather see Congress pass a law than a federal agency seize power in an unconstitutional fashion, members of society should turn less to federal laws and more to themselves if societal problems are going to be solved. <P>

"New Spin on Natural Laws"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
<center>
by Mark Weaver
</center>

<P>
The past hours discussion of the issue of gay marriage may make you wonder where our culture is heading.  What wont people do for a thrill?  What natural laws wont they flout?  Well, wait till you hear this!
<P>Frightful new attractions are popping up across the country this summer, luring children and flouting the law of ...GRAVITY.  
<P>A new roller coaster opening June 1st at Six Flags Magic Mountain is designed to break the 100 mile-an-hour barrier for the first time. The ride, called Superman the Escape, propels you from a standstill to 100 mile-an-hour in seven seconds up a four-hundred-foot tower, where you float in zero gravity until you drop backward.    Thats also at one-hundred miles an hour.  You are weightless for about 6 seconds, another record.
<P>But thats not all.  Competition is pushing designers to make rides faster and higher.
<P>Paul Ruben of the trade magazine Park World says "Were in the roller coaster arms race."   He should know.  His job has involved riding 400 roller coasters.  He says "Ive seen this occurring for 20 years or more. Every park likes to have bragging rights to the fastest, wildest ride for at least one year."
<P>Las Vegas makes its bid with two rides called The Big Shot and The High Roller, both on top of a new one-thousand foot tower. The High Roller tools around a track near the top. The Big Shot shoots you up toward the top then drops you back.  Said one man,    "This is the most exciting thing Ive ever done next to jumping out of an airplane," (which I wouldnt do either.)
<P>Superman and Big Shot use "Star Wars" technology - electromagnetic motors developed for the military.  The motorswhite boxes along the trackspull magnets on the cars, shooting you faster as you cross each one.    Scientists experimented with them to shoot satellites into orbit on tracks. On Superman, YOU are the payload.
<P>Electromagnetic propulsion has already replaced chains and motors on rides in Mexico City, Kentucky and Wisconsin. Other such rides are opening at Worlds of Fun in Kansas City, Mo.; Universal Studios Florida; and Dreamland, near Sydney, Australia.  
<P>Promoters in the amusement business have been bragging about hundred mile-an-hour roller coasters since the 1920s. But that was before radar guns and truth-in-advertising laws.    Actually, 82 mph is the record right now, claimed jointly by Desperado at Buffalo Bills Casino in Stateline, Nev., and the Steel Phantom in Kennywood, outside Pittsburgh.    
<P>Whats it going to be like to ride Superman the Escape?  Rumor has it that Paul Weyrich is going to be the FIRST rider, and hell give you a full report.<P>

"We Are Winning"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>

<P><center>
by Rep. Mark Neumann (R-WI)
</center>
<P>
<P>In 1995, I came to Congress along with 72 other newly elected freshman Members.  
<P>Before any of us even took our oath of office, we resolved ourselves to achieving a very specific goal  to reduce the federal deficit, to balance our budget and to eliminate wasteful Washington spending.  	
<P>Now, just 16 months later, I have good news to report: we are winning this battle!
<P>It hasnt been easy, I can assure you of that.  But the results we have achieved, are well worth the effort.
<P>Let me show you the financial picture of our nation, when I came here, and where we stand now. 
<P>When we arrived here a year ago, this is what we found:  The red line on this chart illustrates the problem of the federal deficit.  It was at about $200 billion per year and growing indefinitely.
<P>If we had allowed this trend to continue, our country would sink further and further into debt, creating a disastrous future for our children and grandchildren.  But we did not allow that to happen.  We took action.
<P>First, we passed a recessions bill.  That means that right off the bat, we took $11 billion of wasteful spending out of the budget.
<P>Then the appropriators went to work.  John Kasich, the chairman of the Budget Committee, set a goal and said $23 billion of wasteful spending had to be eliminated. "Come in $23 billion under the previous year, or our plan to balance the budget wont work," Kasich told them.
<P>Folks, this is the first time in a generation this has been done. 
<P>By December, this is where we were.  We were making progress, but still, we dared to dream.  We dared to dream that we could restore a better future for this Nation.  We dared to dream that we could get our country back on track.
<P>If you look at this chart, you see that this green line is the path to a balanced budget, and the road to a secure financial future for our children and grandchildren.
<P>So we set a deficit target for fiscal year 1996.  That target was $157 billion.  So what happened?  The financial markets looked at this and they reacted positively, and exactly as predicted.
<P>The most positive and helpful sign for the American people was that interest rates stayed down.  And when that happened, more people  especially younger folks  could afford to buy houses and cars.
<P>This created jobs and job opportunities for our young people because somebody has to build those houses and cars.
<P>Folks, this is exactly how America is supposed to work.
<P>What followed next was our unemployment rate went down, as did the welfare rolls and interest cost to the government.
<P>But that was not the end of the story.  When the markets reacted in a positive way, and the appropriators fulfilled their commitment to our Nation, not only did we hit our target for a balanced budget, we came in $8 billion less than where we needed to be in order to reach a balanced budget in 2002.
<P>That is the story behind the story. We are $8 billion ahead of where we need to be in order to reach a balanced budget by the year 2002!
<P>This is great news, and Im happy to deliver it to you, because its not often that you hear good news out of Washington.
<P>And theres even more good news.  Were on track to balancing the budget without raising your taxes.  We did not go back to the 1993 way of raising your taxes.  Weve accomplished this by truly shrinking parts of this government.
<P>This Congress has kept its commitment to balancing the budget.  In the past, other Congresses have spent money hand over fist thinking that was the way to win over the voters.
<P>But this Congress understands that the best thing we can do right now for the American worker, and for our children and our grandchildren is to balance the budget.
<P>A balanced federal budget is a permanent solution to our Nations economic problems.  Never again should we give in to quick-fix gimmicks, election year charades, and snake-oil solutions.<P>
What does a balanced federal budget mean to you and your family?  It means:<P>
<ul><li>lower interest rates which makes it easier to buy houses, cars and other goods;
<LI>it means lower taxes;
<li>it means more jobs, lower unemployment, and fewer people on the welfare rolls;
<li>and finally it means higher salaries and more take-home pay to spend as you see fit.
</ul>Folks, we are winning! Is there more to be done?  Sure there is.<P>
But with your help, we can cut through the demagoguery of the other side and keep our focus on balancing the budget.  When we do that, we will return economic security to you, and a brighter financial future to your children.<P>

"A New Scenario for Dole"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>

<P>
"A New Scenario for Dole"
<P>
Right now things are pretty grim in the Dole camp. As former Vice President Dan Quayle suggested yesterday, things will probably get worse before they get better because Dole is out of money. Moreover, because Bill Clinton was unchallenged in the primaries, he has millions to spend. Dole, on the other hand, remains mired in the muck of Senate procedures where the likes of Ted Kennedy can get the best of him.<P>
There is an alternative scenario kicking around which, if Dole can pull it off, would transform his campaign overnight. You will recall that the Balanced Budget Constitutional Amendment failed by a single vote in the U.S. Senate last year. It received the two-thirds majority needed in the House with votes to spare. But six Democrats who had previously voted for such an amendment suddenly switched positions and the Amendment went down to defeat. When that happened the whole push for the "Contract With America" went into the tank.<P>
The reason that some of the Democrats claimed they switched was articulated by Senator Byron Dorgan of North Dakota in two words: Social Security. Because the so called Social Security Trust Fund is considered on budget, the surpluses it presently produces are used to offset other government spending. Dorgan insisted that this does not offer enough protection for Social Security. In fact, Dorgan came off as some sort of hero in North Dakota because voters believed he had helped to save Social Security.<P>
Well, Republicans ought to just accept that argument. Taking Social Security off budget would mean that to achieve a balanced budget another $35 billion per year would have to be cut from domestic spending. Sounds good to me. Maybe we finally could eliminate the Legal Services Corporation, the National Endowment for the Arts, Goals 2000, Americorps, and other such programs which produce more harm than good.<P>
Right now, quietly behind the scenes, Dole and Illinois Democratic Senator Paul Simon, who fervently believes in a balanced budget and who would like to cap his Senate career by seeing such an amendment passed, are trying to see if the votes are there to pass a new version of the Amendment which takes Social Security off budget.<P>
It is hard to believe that Democrats would provide Dole with such an opportunity. However, the two North Dakota Senators, especially, were so high profile in their contention that they really did favor a balanced budget. If the Amendment got Social Security off the books, it may be hard for them to back away from the issue now.<P>
This new version of the Balanced Budget Amendment should be able to easily pass the House. And guess what? A Constitutional Amendment does not go to Bill Clinton for his signature. It goes directly to the states for ratification.<P>
Picture this:  there are now 31 Republican Governors and half of the state legislative houses are controlled by the Republicans. Imagine that Presidential candidate Bob Dole, now lacking money to run a regular campaign, would go from state to state urging the legislatures to ratify the Balanced Budget Amendment. It would highlight the fact that he was able to get such an amendment through the Congress; it would give the Republican Governors and legislatures a chance to showcase positive changes they are making in state government; and Dole addressing state legislatures would probably get live coverage in most of the states where it would take place.<P>
The Dole campaign, which is on the rocks in every way right now, could be transformed overnight into a positive force for an initiative which is supported overwhelmingly by the American people. There is little that Bill Clinton could do about it. Clinton opposed the Constitutional Amendment for a Balanced Budget when it was before the Congress. His liberal allies know that if such an amendment is in place, federal funding for many of their favorite programs becomes dubious at best.<P>
This scenario is probably too good to be true. My guess is that if Dole and Simon do come up with a Balanced Budget Amendment that satisfies the two Senators from North Dakota, a couple of other Democrats who had previously voted for the Amendment will switch to be against it on the grounds that removing Social Security from the budget will require cutting too much from domestic spending.<P>
As Peter Ferrara suggests in a column in today's Washington Times, Dole should then be commended for trying. In the off chance Dole would be able to make it happen, all bets would be off on the Presidential race. The chance to hammer home the fact that Dole favors a Balanced Budget Amendment and Bill Clinton does not, and make that case before state legislatures in very real and graphic terms, live and in person, would turn around the dour prospects for a Dole presidency.<P>

"Sacrificing Principle for Party Loyalty"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>

<P>
How do I hate this town? Let me count the ways! For one thing, almost no one really puts himself on the line for what he says he believes in.<P>
Case in point. Majority Leader Dick Armey wears his conservatism on his sleeve. To hear him talk, you would think he is one of the most principled of men ever to grace the Leadership of either party. I am sure he thinks of himself as principled. But Dick Armey is a party man first and foremost. And as a party man he puts protecting incumbents ahead of principle.<P>
Congresswoman Sue Kelly is one such incumbent. She voted against many items in the "Contract with America." When the Leadership said last summer that the Labor HHS Appropriations Bill was Armageddon and twisted arms until they hurt with GOP members who were reluctant to vote for the bill, Sue Kelly defied the Leadership. Worst of all, Sue Kelly was one of five Republicans to vote with President Clinton against the partial birth abortion bill.<P>
Sue Kellys opponent in the GOP primary is former Congressman Joe DioGuardi. DioGuardi is famous for having been the candidate who retired Bella Abzug from the House of Representatives. DioGuardi, when he served in the House, was the only certified public accountant to ever to do so. It is DioGuardi who pointed to the irregularities of the House majority which Speaker Gingrich was pleased to pick up on when he took over a year and a half ago.<P>
DioGuardi would be a loyal soldier when it came to things such as the "Contract." He would never vote against the Leadership on a key appropriations bill. In New Yorks multi-party system, DioGuardi already has the Right to Life party line. He would not be a dissenter on an issue like partial birth abortions. Yet Dick Armey, to help protect Sue Kelly, has gone so far as to call potential DioGuardi contributors in New York to ask them not to give to the DioGuardi campaign. Other members of the Leadership have tried to make the case for Kelly as well on the grounds that the GOP will lose the seat if she is not the nominee.<P>
First of all, if DioGuardi wins the GOP nomination and already has the Conservative and Right to Life party nominations, he will have an excellent chance of getting elected. But even if Kelly had the better chance of holding the seat, is incumbent loyalty worth sacrificing ones principles? Is it worth helping someone who is so liberal that even partial birth abortion doesnt stir her conscience? Is incumbent loyalty worth stabbing a fine upstanding man like DioGuardi in the back?<P>
Take the case of Congressman Bill Goodling of Pennsylvania. Speaker Gingrich gives passionate speeches about how the labor unions are out to destroy his Republican majority. Indeed they are and first among them is the National Education Association, the teachers union. When push comes to shove, Congressman Goodling, a former teacher, does the NEAs biding inside the GOP caucus.<P>
Goodling, who was first elected to replace his father George Goodling in 1974, was challenged in the Republican primary by civic activist Charlie Gerow. Gerow ran because he wanted to join the likes of the eager young freshmen who have made such a difference in Congress. Goodlings cozy relationship with the NEA was one of the key issues in the campaign. Well, who made an all-embracing appearance in the district for Bill Goodling at the strategic moment when it was clear it was a horse race? Why Speaker Gingrich, of course. <P>
When the results were in, Goodling was only re-nominated with a 53% to 47% vote. Gerow contends that if Gingrich had just stayed out, he would have defeated Goodling in this heavily Republican district. Then the NEA would not have had a mole inside the GOP ranks. But incumbent loyalty is more important to the Leadership than principle, when principle means standing up for those who believe the same things that the Leadership professes to believe.<P>
Perhaps one can morally justify neutrality on the part of the Leadership in such cases.  After all, members of the Leadership are put in a difficult position when one of their members is challenged in a primary. But all out support for incumbent members who are challenged by candidates of principle is next to impossible to justify if you really believe in the causes you preach to the faithful on a daily basis. No wonder the American electorate has grown increasingly cynical.<P>
Contrast this incumbent loyalty among Republicans with the Democrats. Congressman Ralph Hall of Texas is perhaps the most conservative Democrat in Congress. His voting record is better than that of most Republicans. A couple of times since he was first elected in 1980, Hall was perceived to be in trouble. He might have been replaced with a Republican. The Democratic Leadership was nowhere to be found. Hall was on his own. That is because Hall routinely votes with the Republicans on issues and defies the Democratic Leadership even on crucial votes. Their loyalty to liberalism was greater than their loyalty to one of their incumbents who votes against them. Even though Hall is a close friend of mine and I am glad he survived those challenges, I have to admire the liberals for at least standing for something.<P>
One possible Republican exception to this sorry state of affairs is Oklahomas freshman Representative Steve Largent. Late last year Speaker Gingrich sought to punish a group of conservatives because they didnt cave in when he did on shutting down the government. Largent then stepped in and did the fund-raisers for those on whom Gingrich canceled out. It worked out well. The public would rather pay to see a star athlete like Largent any day over a Washington politician.<P>
What Largent did took real fortitude. But of course he is a freshman. Were he serving his ninth term like Gingrich or his sixth term like Armey, he might not be as eager to cross a member of the Leadership.<P>
There is a reason that many of us who used to be adamantly opposed to term limits are now among its most ardent backers. The longer I stay here and see good men like DioGuardi and Gerow stabbed in the back by supposed philosophical standard bearers such as Gingrich and Armey, the more passionate about term limits I become.<P>

"Making a Tax Cut Better"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
Last week, Wednesday, I was witness to a dialogue between a freshman Senator and a freshman Congressman. That conversation got to the essence of where this nation is going in fiscal terms.<P>
The Senator was John Ashcroft, the former Governor of Missouri. He was explaining his proposal to make social security taxes deductible. Such a tax cut would mean an average middle class family would save more than $1700 a year in federal taxes. The Ashcroft program would cost $35 billion for its first year and more than $50 billion each year thereafter.<P>
The Congressman was Wisconsins Mark Neumann, the single most focused Member of the House on the question of our national debt.<P>
Neumann asked how the Senator was going to "pay for this legislation in terms of spending cuts."  The Senator from Missouri was vague.  "Well cut some money from corporate welfare and well get some money through welfare reform and from overhead expenses from the federal government," Ashcroft told the Congressman.<P>
"No, I mean specifically," Neumann replied. "What exactly would you cut and how much?"<P>
The Senator didnt know. Neumann continued, "Look, I like tax cuts. I want to vote for this legislation. But I cant vote for anything which will enlarge the deficit. Unless you know exactly what you are going to cut and from where youre going to cut it, the bill will end up enlarging the deficit."<P>
The Senator was silent. Neumann was exactly right. <P>
I think the Ashcroft idea is a splendid one. It would provide a middle class tax cut in exactly the way it should be provided. I hope his bill gains traction. But the day has passed when any responsible legislator should propose any piece of legislation without giving specific consideration to what will be cut from federal spending if the legislation is passed. <P>
With trillions of dollars in off book debt and unfunded liabilities, not to mention the current budget deficit, we simply cannot afford to pass legislation without looking at the precise consequences of enacting such bills. We have been avoiding such consequences for the past several decades. Look where it has brought us.<P>
The correct answer to all this is that we should do both. We ought to pass Ashcrofts bill, but Ashcroft should spell out precisely what portions of the federal budget he will cut out in order to make up for the lost revenue his bill would engender. Then we will have the best of both worlds. We will be giving a tax cut to the people who need it most, in the most equitable method possible. At the same time we will further cut federal spending in other areas so as not to enlarge the debt. All responsible legislators need to ask the questions Mark Neumann asked. Then we will truly be making progress. <P>

"Supporting Tyranny over Freedom"
</h2>
(Delivered by Brad Keena)
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>

<P>
A 58-year-old, highly educated, and soft spoken freedom fighter is, as we speak, 
conducting a hunger strike in a Belarus jail. He is the victim of a Stalinist style 
crackdown which is taking place in the former Soviet Republic. 
<p>Yuri Khadykas crime is that he dared to speak out against the repressive and dictatorial 
regime of hard line Communist Alexandr Lukashenko. Lukashenko is trying to 
reintegrate his country with Russia without a vote of the people giving him authority to 
do so. Lukashenko admires Adolph Hitler and yearns for the return of a true Russian 
leader like Josef Stalin so that at least real order can be restored. 
<p>Among all of the former Soviet Republics, Belarus has made the least progress in moving 
toward democracy and free enterprise. Even in places such as Georgia, Armenia, and the 
Central Asian Republics things are better off than in Belarus. Lukashenko has suspended 
the parliament, even though his fellow Communists have a lopsided majority there. He 
does not want to give a forum to the few Democratic voices who serve in that body and 
that is where Yuri Khadyka comes in. 
<p>Freedom fighters are given no access to the media. Their voices in elected government 
have been silenced. The only alternative for them now is to take to the streets. But for 
doing so, Khadyka and a couple hundred organizers of a 30,000 person demonstration in 
downtown Minsk were arrested on April 26th. 
<p>Khadyka has not been allowed to talk to his lawyer. He may languish in jail for up to six 
months before there is any trial, if there is one. And in Lukashenkos Belarus, the 
outcome of the trial will be a forgone conclusion, just as the trials of dissidents were 
foreordained in the former Soviet Union. 
<p>What is happening in Belarus is symbolic of what is happening in other places in the 
East. It is the prototype for what will take place if Communist candidate Gannady 
Zuganov is elected President in the upcoming elections. He has promised a similar 
crackdown on those regarded as opponents of the Communist ideology.
<p>To us, Khadyka is not just some remote figure we hear about in short- wave radio 
coverage of foreign developments. He is someone we know well. Bob Krieble and I have 
had lengthy discussions with him on several occasions. His son, 29-year-old Alexey, has 
worked for us at the Krieble Institute of the Free Congress Foundation for the past four 
years. He is one of the young, dedicated freedom fighters who have risked their lives to 
help promote freedom and democracy in the former Soviet empire. 
<p>Last Saturday night I was awakened in the middle of the night with news of the ominous 
developments in Belarus. Alexey pleaded for our help to get word of the plight of the 
Belarus freedom fighters to American officials. Well, our discussions with the State 
Department were exactly what you would expect. This Administration, while willing to 
involve itself in imposing a leftist government in Haiti, is unwilling to lift a finger to 
protest repression in Belarus. 
<p>The realities of the repression there do not square with this nations policy of the 
reconstruction of the former Soviet Union. Yes, the State Department wants to see the 
former Soviet Union re-established in some new form. Our officials think that will bring 
stability to the region. Yes, it will bring stability the stability of the graveyard. 
<p>While most of the other organizers who have been arrested in Belarus have now been 
released from jail, Khadyka remains there. He is a special problem case because he is also 
a Christian leader who has sought the return of the ancient Bylorussian language as well. 
Someone with his views is not convenient for the Lukashenko regime. 
<p>We have managed to interest some Members of Congress in what is happening in 
Belarus. Robert Novak devoted todays syndicated column to this subject. Perhaps little 
by little we will bring world attention to the plight of freedom loving people in this small 
former Soviet Republic of l2 million people. 
<p>The issue here isnt that Yuri Khadyka is a truly fine man, which he is. The issue here 
that the United States government is cooperating with pro-Communist forces in the 
reconstruction of the Evil Empire. That is not why our men and women died on the 
battlefield opposing tyranny in this long and bloody twentieth Century. This is not why 
countless more unsung heroes died during the Cold War.
<p>The time to speak up against this evil is now before it is too late. Failure to do so may 
well mean that the next Century will bring confrontation with a new evil empire all over 
again. Only this time, the outcome might not be the same.

"Washingtons Misplaced Perspective"
</h2>
(Delivered by Brad Keena)
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>

<P>
	There is old adage that says "politics is like sausage  you don't want to know how it is made!"
	Considering this is an election year, each passing day is proving those words were inspired to describe Washington and its establishment.  Washington today is like a great big sausage factory.  Broadcasting here so close to the factory, we sense it all around us.  Even now, as I listen carefully, I can hear the haunting screams of ordinary citizens falling into giant tax machines ripping out their wallets; tossing what remains in huge grinders designed to pulverize faith and morality through the terrible engines of an unstoppable federal judiciary.  In the air this election year is the malodorous waft of this huge sausage factory we call Washington.  The mixture created in this factory is ghastly to look at until the Administration adds its coloring to give the final grind an appearance of being edible.
<P>	Like short-order cooks, the establishment media fries up this nasty glop into bite size bits, served on plates with ugly china patterns with names like HUD, Education, Commerce, and Labor.
The table is set before the hungry establishment elite competing in a sausage-eating contest  a game which will last until November.  No one at the table is willing to admit where the sausage came from, how it is made, or what's in it.  To admit this would cause each at the table to lose his or her appetite:  for the sausage has come from outside of Washington.  It has been scandalously and horribly made with the most vile additives.  Its ingredients include the faith and hopes and dreams of ordinary Americans.  Together the future of each has been reprocessed into morsels prepared for the gluttonous elite seated at Washington's table.
<P>	The machine grinds on.  The terrible sounds continue night and day.  The stench of this factory permeates the air.  Unending is the Establishment's voracious appetite for power over its citizenry.
Perspective is a remarkable thing.  As humans, we tend to get lost in the false perspective of seeming permanence.  Time is slow moving.  Often we think what we see at the moment is permanent, but we're wrong.  America did not always look this way.  We have allowed our own government to remove itself from morality's scale.  The courts have overruled God's moral measurements, the government has thrown aside God's ethical scales.  The true measurement is sure.  It's weight is exact.  It's precision remains for all time.  Yet our culture has chosen a perspective which avoids to close a look at the moral and ethical realities.  Don't ask, don't tell about homosexuality in the military; don't ask, don't tell about the murder of babies even moments before birth; don't ask, don't tell about a political process promising to deliver everything we want at the expense of everything we've got.
<P>	This is not America.  This is another nation.  It's capital has become the sausage factory.  
In the banquet hall, its king and his lords, his wives and his concubines are drinking the blood of society in silver vessels, praising the gods of the Establishment.  On one wall of Washington's terrible banquet hall is a great hand.  It is writing Washington's future, telling the measurement and weight of the moral scales society had allowed Washington to disregard.  The writing on this wall is becoming visible for all to see:  "Moral integrity has been found wanting. Days are numbered. The kingdom is about to become divided."
<P>	Meanwhile, the banquet continues.  The writing on the wall has gone yet unnoticed.  The Washington sausage factory drones on.<P>

"FDA Commissioners Arrogance"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>


<P>
I have spoken before of the arrogance of the federal Food and Drug Administration, the FDA, in its constant effort to seize more power for itself. Further evidence of that arrogance just keeps on building. <P>
The Washington Legal Foundation has filed a First Amendment lawsuit against the FDA, challenging the agencys crackdown on the dissemination of information regarding the "off label" uses of FDA approved drugs and medical devices. The Washington Legal Foundation lawsuit contends that the FDAs restrictions violate the First Amendment rights of both the providers and the recipients of such information. <P>
Federal law currently prohibits the manufacturer of an FDA approved drug or device from specifying on the product label any uses of the product other than the precise use approved by the FDA. However, doctors are free to prescribe FDA approved products for uses other than those specified by the product label. In fact, in many areas of medicine, most of the treatment recognized by the medical community consists of off label uses of FDA approved products. <P>
Recently the FDA has begun a crackdown on manufacturers who become involved, in any way, in the dissemination of information about the off label uses of their own products, such as distributing to doctors medical text books which contain information about the off label drug uses. The Washington Legal Foundation suit contends that this is a violation of the First Amendment which effects not only the producer of the product but also the recipients, first the doctor and ultimately the patient. <P>
Commissioner David Kessler of the FDA refused to appear at a scheduled deposition on April 24th. The legal foundation is trying to depose Kessler in order to, in its words, "establish that he was personally responsible for the FDA crackdown and that in directing the FDA to implement its no policy, he gave no thought to whether the crackdown might violate free speech rights." Washington Legal Foundations lawyers claim that senior FDA officials deposed to date in the lawsuit have admitted that First Amendment concerns played no role in their policy deliberations. The foundation contends that it needs to depose Kessler as well to establish that he too was oblivious to First Amendment rights in formulating agency policy.<P>
Well, Kessler was a no-show. Instead he filed a motion to quash the deposition which Federal Judge Royce Lamberth will rule on shortly. Such a move on Kesslers part is unprecedented. "It is outrageous that Commissioner Kessler thinks he is above the law and not subject to the same litigation rules as anyone else who gets involved in a lawsuit," said the Foundations Chief Legal Counsel Richard Samp. Samp pointed out that even Bill Clinton has had to give a deposition in connection with Whitewater and the First Lady has had to appear before a grand jury in connection with the White House travel office. <P>
Samp contends that Kessler said one of his top priorities as Commissioner would be to crackdown on the off label uses of FDA approved products. Never mind that people are being cured by these products. Never mind that such products are recognized as the only possible remedy in some medical cases. What the FDA seeks is total control. <P>
That attitude was reflected in a very personal letter former Congresswoman Marilyn Lloyd  sent to some Members of the House. The Congresswoman from Tennessee served in the House for 20 years before retiring after the 1994 elections. Marilyn Lloyd told her former colleagues that she had undergone a mastectomy in 1991 and had chosen silicone breast implant surgery. But just before her surgery was to take place the FDA ruled that such operations could not go forward. <P>
Mrs. Lloyd contends that the FDA made this ruling with no scientific evidence that such implants were harmful. She quotes Dr. John E. Woods, vice chairman of the Department of Surgery at the Mayo Clinic as saying, "Instead of protecting the health and concerns of women, this moratorium caused undue stress and anxiety for women with implants and women who wanted them around the world." Mrs. Lloyd told the Members of Congress to whom she wrote, "I want you to understand that the irresponsible nature of the FDAs decision has led to real women  mothers, wives and daughters  dying needlessly." <P>
Again the issue here is one of control. That is what David Kessler and his agents are all about. Control over other peoples lives. <P>
There is more and more evidence that the FDA is a government agency totally out of control. This Congress owes it to the long-suffering American public to take the steps necessary to tie Commissioner Kesslers hands.  Congress must do this before more innocent people die needlessly because they are unsuspectingly caught up in one of Kesslers little power games. <P>

"House Speaker Cultivating Challengers"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>


<P>
These are not the best of times for Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich. First, he was savagely attacked by New York Senator Al D'Amato who claimed that Gingrich had misread the 1994 elections and thus had proposed radical initiatives instead of the incremental changes the voters wanted. Now comes word from inside the House that some Members are talking seriously about challenging Gingrich for the Speaker's post in the next Congress.<P>
The challenge comes not from the dozen or so hard-core conservatives among the freshmen who have never cared much for the Speaker. Rather, the challenge comes from an outer core of less-adamant conservatives. One multi-term Member told me he knew of at least two candidates who were considering the run. All of the current members of the leadership strongly back Gingrich and are opposed to any run against him.<P>
This whole issue is relevant only if Republicans keep control of the Congress, because in the event they become a minority, the Republicans will lose one leadership position and Gingrich has already said publicly that he would drop out in such a case.<P>
The rap against the Speaker from those who want an alternative is two-fold. First, his opponents claim, he plays games on crucial issues. There is now a dispute, for example, between the Speaker and Majority Leader Dick Armey over the minimum wage issue. Armey says he doesn't want to vote on the issue at all because the minimum wage is part of the Democratic agenda. Gingrich points to a letter he received from 38 "moderate" Republican Members of the House who back the Minimum wage.  He says a vote on the issue is inevitable and so he wants it brought to the floor with Republican provisions attached. <P>Conservative opponents of Gingrich claim that he actually encouraged the "moderates" to write the letter to him in the first place. They quote one of their colleagues as telling them "I didn't want to sign the letter (on the minimum wage) but Newt asked me to." Their claim is that this is all too typical of how Gingrich operates, pitting one side against another. Moreover they contend that when liberal Republicans bolt the party line, nothing is said to them at all. But when conservatives disagree with Gingrich they are taken to the woodshed, cursed at, and told to get in the real world.<P>
The second rap against Gingrich is that he is often unfocused and flits from issue to issue. The Gingrich opponents claim that the Speaker all but abrogated his responsibilities earlier this year, telling the other House leaders they were going to run the show while he concentrated on strategies to get Bob Dole elected President and to raise money for the Republican party.<P>
Opponents think they have a chance to defeat Gingrich because of the dissatisfaction among the current freshman class as well as the fact that a number of older Members were never fond of the one-time fire brand in the first place.  In addition, they believe, incoming freshmen won't have the kind of attachment to the Speaker that this class once had.<P>
As I see it, the challenge to Gingrich, when all is said and done, probably won't work. I think his adversaries ought to step back and look at the situation and then take some action.<P>
First off, they should acknowledge that Gingrich is without peer in proclaiming a vision for their party. It is a party which otherwise lacks vision.  They should be reluctant to toss overboard the one person they have in their midst who has that capability.<P>
Second, they should call the Speaker's bluff when they think he is playing games with them. Newt is, above all, a realist. If he knows he can't get by with the sort of tactics which enrage his opponents he won't try them. The next time they get "woodsheded" for doing the right thing, they should go public with the issue. In such cases, the vast majority of ordinary folks will be with Members trying to do the right thing, not with the Speaker. This is part of Newt's style. Last year, for example, a delegation from Focus on the Family visited the Speaker expressing extreme discomfort at the direction of the Republican party. Gingrich told the delegation if he were in their position, he would threaten a third party. This is exactly the way Gingrich operates.  If things like that become a public issue, the Speaker is not likely to continue down the same path.<P>
Finally, these conservatives should look for someone among their ranks to fill the shoes of Vin Weber and Bob Walker. When Newt Gingrich first came to the Congress back in 1978, he was extremely unfocused.  As a result, he was not taken seriously by his colleagues. Mr. Weber, a former six-term Congressman from Minnesota, recognized great potential in Gingrich. So did Rep. Walker (R-PA), the watchdog of the House floor. Together, they gently but firmly took Newt's hand and helped to organize and focus him. They were an integral part of his success. But Mr. Weber left the Congress in 1992.  Rep. Walker is leaving at the end of this term. Both need to be replaced. Speaker Gingrich came to trust them and rely on them even though initially they were not the best of friends. I would suggest that conservatives disgruntled with the Speaker try to become to Gingrich the kind of assets that Weber and Walker were.  This would afford them the type of positive influence over the Speaker that these two Members had.<P>
Most challenges to Republican leadership figures turn out to be just talk. This challenge, although being discussed by serious Members of the House, will likely also turn out to be just talk.  That is, unless of course, the Speaker himself performs in such a way that he drives Members into the arms of his opponents.<P>

"The Real Solution to Illegal Immigration"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>

<P>
"The Real Solution to Illegal Immigration"
<P>
The Senate has passed an immigration bill by a 97 to 3 margin. The bill is similar to a measure which has already passed the House. President Clinton is signaling that he will sign the bill. So our worries about immigration are over, right?<P>
Sorry, but I've heard this one before. In 1986, the same Senator Alan Simpson of Wyoming who guided this bill through the Senate, assured us that immigration was going to be under control because employers would be required to verify that a prospective employee was in the country legally. The measure didn't work. It did, however, increase the number of illegal documents in circulation.<P> 
This bill does contain some provisions which have merit. The bill doubles the number of officers on boarder patrol. It also provides for enforcement of the measure, which has been on the books since 1882, regarding legal immigrants. A sponsor is supposed to guarantee that the person he brings to this country will not be on the public assistance rolls for five years after coming here. Since the 1960's that provision has never been enforced. A combination of court decisions and lenient administrations have caused the law to be ignored. This bill gives that measure some teeth if an Administration has the courage to use it.
<P>The legislation also contains a provision for a pilot program to create new documents that would be difficult to copy.  However, one of the bill's chief sponsors, Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa), was unable to answer how such a law would keep the new documents out of the hands of those who misrepresent themselves to authorities.
<P> All of this aside, this bill is utterly meaningless without true welfare reform. Welfare reform has been twice vetoed by this President. The reason some immigrants come here is to work. Fine. If they are taking jobs Americans won't fill, I don't have a problem with that. But many illegal immigrants come here for our welfare benefits. Unless, and until, it is clear that we as a society can deny welfare benefits to anyone who is not here legally, no beefed up boarder patrols or document controls are going to mean very much. 
<P>Pass genuine welfare reform and watch the flow of illegal immigrants dry up to manageable proportions. Don't pass welfare reform and watch this bill fail the way the immigration reform bill of 1986 failed. It is almost that simple. 
<P>

"Mayor Should Heed Friends Advice"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>


<P>
It is an American tradition that local politics is always more colorful than national politics. So ordinarily the strange wanderings of a Mayor would not be suitable for a commentary with a national focus. But when it comes to the Mayor of the nation's capital, it is another matter. <P>
Marion Barry is a national, indeed, international figure. So when the Mayor suddenly leaves town for a retreat in St. Louis to reconnect with God and his spirituality, it is news. It is news, even more so, because one of Mayor Barry's closest friends, Rock Newman, who headed up the "Rock The Vote" effort for Barry to return to office in 1994, has now called on the Mayor to resign. The Mayor isn't denying that this is a consideration.<P>
Now, Marion Barry is still recovering from prostate cancer. He has had alcohol and drug problems in the past. He served six months in jail for a charge related to the use of cocaine. His subsequent election as alderman and then comeback as Mayor was called the political miracle of the century.<P>
I am not trying to pile on here. But it was Marion Barry's aides who called the news media in the middle of the night to tell them to show up at the Baltimore airport at 6:30 a.m. Wednesday for a Barry press conference.  The press arrived only to have the Mayor tell the reporters that they should leave him and his wife alone. He was headed to St. Louis to a retreat house. On the surface it is very confusing; but since just about everyone else in this town is offering an opinion about what is happening to the Mayor, I shall offer one of my own.<P>
For decades now, Marion Barry's faith has been in government. Even as a young radical agitator he was always trying to get the government to spend more on his people. He upset the city's establishment in getting elected Mayor. When he did so, he greatly expanded the city government. Marion Barry became a hero to many because he was able to put them on the payroll. His liberal friends in the Congress blessed him with every sort of experimental federal program imaginable. They gave Barry control over billions of federal dollars with which to put more people on the payroll. None of these programs was ever monitored very closely.<P>
Washington, DC, was the laboratory of liberalism. If you needed help, the Mayor had a taxpayer-supported program for you. It worked for a time. But as is the case with all solutions which are not based in reality, the fix was not permanent.<P>
Marion Barry knew the heights of power. While in prison he knew the depths of powerlessness. He vowed he would come back and indeed, five years after he was released from jail, he was back at City Hall. But what the Washington, DC, Mayor came back to was not the same place he left. The consequences of his liberal programs had come back to haunt the city. The population was down. Crime was up. The deficit was high. Private sector jobs were low. New federal programs were out. Federal control over Barry's budget was in.<P>
The politics Marion Barry had practiced so well over so many years had ground to a halt. The Mayor, who was used to solving a problem by giving someone a taxpayer supported job no matter what their skills or productivity, was now virtually powerless to act. He was presiding over a city with sharply increasing problems; a city which no longer could be run by the whims of its Mayor. It was run by tough regulators determined to bring spending under control.<P>
Marion Barry's total faith in government had brought him to this dead end. That is the making of a spiritual crisis. At such times, even people who have disregarded most of what the Bible teaches will turn to the Scriptures. I believe that what is causing at least some of the Mayor's problems is the realization that he has placed his faith in the wrong place. Bigger government did not bring salvation.<P>
Facing the ruins of what once was a well-ordered city, Marion Barry cannot come to grips with reality. Even after the Republicans took over the Congress and made it clear the city was going to have to shape up, Barry went on acting as if nothing had happened. Committee Chairmen and even the minority Democrats on Capitol Hill accused the Mayor of engaging in fantasy. He did not want to believe that the way things had been for decades was now at an end.<P>
The Mayor has come face to face with the real world and he doesn't like what he sees. It doesn't conform to the untruths he has sold himself and his followers. The world as it really exists, which Mayor Barry now confronts on a daily basis, is really an unpleasant place. The instant gratification solutions Barry has applied  all these years are no longer available. 
<P>I wish the Mayor well in reconnecting with God. I hope this time it is the true God and not the gods of liberalism who have been enshrined in Washington these many years. Meanwhile the Mayor would be well to heed the advice of  Rock Newman. The nation's capital could use new leadership that has the ability to cope with the new realities.<P>

"Republicans Should Stick to the Issues" 
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
There is no doubt that Bill Clinton is on a roll. His latest poll numbers show him with an unprecedented 21-point lead over presumed Republican nominee Bob Dole. That poll doesnt even take into account what will happen if, as is likely, Ross Perot runs again and splits the anti-Clinton vote.
<P>All of the dire predictions which many of us made about Clintons foreign policy adventures, especially our involvement in Bosnia, have thus far not come true. For a President who said that domestic issues would be his primary focus, Clinton seems to be making quite a name for himself in the Balkans, in the Middle East, in Russia and  elsewhere.
<P>And while the economy isnt exactly bustling along, growth is probably just adequate enough to prevent electoral problems for the President.
<P>Then there is Whitewater and associated problems. Whitewater was supposed to draw Clinton a primary opponent. It did not. He is the first Democrat since FDR not to have one. he President just made a three-and-a-half-hour videotaped interview for the criminal trial of James and Susan McDougal and Governor Jim Guy Tucker of Arkansas. They are the three charged with conspiracy and fraud in the Whitewater affair. The text of the tape will be released but not the tape itself because the White House believes that Clinton opponents would try to turn the tape into a 60-second commercial.
<P>Whitewater has been in the news since before Clinton took office and yet it has failed to effect the standing of this President. My co-hosts and I debated this on last nights Campaign 96 show with Mark Levine of Landmark Legal Foundation. Levine believes that Clinton is in for big-time trouble down the road on Whitewater. I disagree. I think if, as is probable, Gov. Tucker gets acquitted, Whitewater will be over and done with. To pursue it after such a verdict will simply appear too partisan. Republicans would run the risk of a significant backlash.
<P>The polls show that a majority of the people in the United States believe that the Clintons are hiding something. But the same polls show that the majority doesnt care. The question is why dont they care? Well, first off Whitewater is too complicated to understand. The public will not be interested in this case unless and until there is something simple which they can relate to. They understood Hillary and the cattle futures issue. They understood the Watergate break-in. They understood Chairman Rostenkowskis misdeeds. They dont understand this case. Secondly, whatever the Clintons did, it mostly took place before he was President. True, Vice President Spiro Agnew was driven from office by what he did as Governor of Maryland. But most voters want to know what Clinton has done while President, not something which happened a decade and a half ago. Thirdly, the voters today are cynical about politicians. There is no shock value to the notion that a politician and his wife might be in this game to get something for themselves. In fact the public believes that all politicians are similarly guilty.  Since it is presumed, guilt that is confirmed just doesnt have that much of an impact.<P>
Yes, of course, there is the media which made a national cause out of John Sununu getting dental work while on official business. But the media has not covered Whitewater with any intensity. Still, I cant fault the national media on this one as I have done on many other issues. After Clinton came into office, hundreds of Pulitzer Prize seeking reporters swarmed into Little Rock seeking to break the story that would bring this President down. They did that, not because they disliked Clinton, (most of them voted for him) but because it would bring them more power. Some journalists really worked at it for months going on years, and with unlimited expense accounts. They simply never found the smoking gun.
<P>Looking at Clintons standing with the voters, some Republicans are hoping against hope that Whitewater will turn into something to rescue their fortunes. They are foolish to count on it. If it comes at all, it could well be after this President is re-elected.
<P>I have said from the beginning of this case that I didnt think it would impact politically. Republicans, I suggested, would be well off to make the philosophical case against liberalism and the Clinton Presidency. If something does come of Whitewater they will get an added benefit but meanwhile the 1996 election would be about real issues which matter to the American people. They have not done so. And now they are reduced to hoping that one of Clintons friends will drop something sensational at the Whitewater hearings or that somehow the jury in Arkansas will find Governor Tucker guilty. Thus the reality is that Bob Dole cannot win the Presidency. Only Bill Clinton can lose it. That has never been a winning strategy to gain power in this country. Even if the Republicans do take power under these circumstances, they do so without any mandate to change anything.
<P>It is the ninth-hour and the sun is nearly setting on this election season. It is still not too late for this election to be about opposing philosophies and clear differences on issues. If that case is made, Whitewater wont be needed. If something substantive relating to Whitewater does break between now and the election, it will only underscore the philosophical case which has already been made. It remains to be seen now if, at least, conservatives will stick to the issues this year instead of waiting for the political equivalent of the lottery known as Whitewater.<P>

"Defending Caesar Against God"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>

<P>
The Capitol today is filled with believers who are praying for their country. Although the "Washington for Jesus" rally did not live up to the crowd expectations of its promoters, it is nevertheless impressive to see that thousands of people are willing to take time off to come to their nation's capital to ask God's blessing on this land. 
<P>Indeed, it will take the intervention of the Almighty if this nation is going to reverse its course. Yesterday's hearings on assisted suicide, chaired by Rep. Charles Canady of (R-FL), pointed to another tragedy for the nation which is coming at us with thunderous speed. Yet hardly a whimper is heard about it from the nation's religious leaders. <P>
Saving this nation will be up to ordinary people. History is replete with examples of religious leaders who were either silent in the face of great moral crises or who actually cooperated with those inflicting moral crimes on the nation. I am not indicting all religious leaders here. There were a few leaders who did stand up to be counted at the moment of truth and there are some today. But usually those leaders are bucking the trend.<P>
Yesterday some 30 so-called religious leaders from Protestant and Jewish denominations sent President Clinton a letter backing him on the partial birth abortion veto. They wanted to give the President cover for one of the worst decisions ever made by an American President. Clinton's decision even earned him a particular denunciation by the Pope, something which almost never happens. But these Church leaders, including the presiding Bishop of the Episcopal Church, have seen fit to tell the President he was right in vetoing the bill. They defend Caesar against God.
<P>White House staffers say that the President has actually profited from his stand. The latest Gallop poll, taken after the President's veto, shows that Bill Clinton is leading Bob Dole by the largest margin ever, 58% to 36%. Thus, they claim, the President has done the right thing because the people back him. 
<P>Well, as I said, the ordinary folks, including the generation-X contingent who raised their hands in prayer on the mall today, are the people who will help turn this nation around. They are speaking out against the moral outrages of our time. The "Washington For Jesus" rally held a mock trial with secular society and its deadly sins as defendants. One of the teenagers wore a T-shirt which read, "I fear no evil because He is with me." Indeed, it is evil which stalks the land.
<P>When a six-year-old boy kills a two-month-old child, it is the product of evil. Yet in our time, we scarcely acknowledge evil. In fact, we attempt to turn evil into good. A new movie called "The Craft" attempts to glorify witchcraft. One of the stars of this movie says that all she is trying to do is to show that there is power all around us of which we are unaware. Yes, the power of death. All of these events happening in todays society have something in common. They are all a part of the ancient struggle between life and death. This struggle dates back to when God put man on earth.
<P>Today, however, death has more advocates. Death has the apologists. Death, whether by killing the unborn, or killing the terminally ill, or killing innocent bystanders with guns, or seducing the innocent through witchcraft, or by a thousand other means, death is triumphing over life in contemporary society. But God is life. So what the cult of death really translates to is a rejection of God. 
<P>Don't expect this nation's government or religious leaders to give the principle of life the upper hand. That will depend on the prayers of not only those who could show up in Washington today, but the prayers of all believers, of all faiths, wherever they are in this nation.  In the end it will depend on those who are willing to stand up and intone that ancient refrain, "Choose Life. Choose Life."<P>

Revolution?
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
<P>
Last year at this time the new Leadership in the House of Representatives spoke boldly of "revolution." Speaker Gingrich especially insisted that business-as-usual was out; fundamental changes in the way that Washington does business were in. When some of us suggested that the Senate and President Clinton were unlikely to go along with such changes, House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob Livingston retorted, "President Clinton is irrelevant and the Senate doesn't matter. Not one dime can be spent on a single program unless the House of Representatives okays the spending." Known as the One-House Veto strategy, this was the way Republicans were going to force an end to programs which they considered bad for the country.
<P>What a difference a year makes. Speaker Gingrich may have fun cavorting with Jay Leno or acting as substitute host for "Larry King Live," but these days there is no talk of revolution. The rest of the Republican Leadership tries to put a happy face on what happened with the budget process, but it is hard for them to do. As for Chairman Livingston, he doesn't much like to answer questions on the One-House Veto strategy. 
<P>That is because on substance Bill Clinton won just about everything he fought for in the fiscal year 1996 budget which was finally approved by Congress. Americorps, which is a device to pay volunteers to be active in politics, supporting Clinton and his friends, is still with us. The National Endowment for the Arts, despite its subsidies for pornographic art, is in the budget. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting, despite its ability to earn billions by marketing its own products, gets subsidized for a longer term than even budgets approved by Democratic Congresses. The Legal Services Corporation, which over the years has done more harm than any other single federal program I can think of, is alive and well. Goals 2000, which is an attempt to federalize education and to impose "outcome based" methods on local school districts survived because Bill Clinton fought for it and the Republicans were unwilling to stand up and fight against it. The Commerce Department, Department of Education, and even HUD are still with us.  
<P>I could go on and on, but you get the picture. It is true that this budget does cut more money from discretionary programs than even the Republicans had proposed when they first put forth their seven-year balanced budget. So in that sense, the Republicans have a right to some credit. They are actually ahead of where they said they would be in reducing the deficit and getting the budget into balance, which is a little-known fact completely lost in the national debate.
<P>The bad news is that the federal programs the Republicans sought to kill have been funded and will be funded again in the 1997 budget. If Bill Clinton is re-elected and if the Democrats take over Congress, as well they might, these programs will grow again and be right back where they were. True, most of them have been significantly reduced under the newly-approved budget, but the bureaucrats don't care. As long as they stay alive, as long as the infrastructure stays intact, they can survive to fight another day. That is why the freshmen Republicans wanted to pull these programs up by their roots. That is why they proposed eliminating three or four cabinet departments. 
<P>I am not faulting the Republicans because these things didn't happen. The fact is that one election simply isn't enough to turn a nation around which has been heading in the opposite direction for seventy years. What the Republicans should be blamed for is not waging an all-out fight to accomplish the ends which they originally sought. In the process of such a fight they probably would have managed to get half again as much as they got. But even if they didn't, the public would understand what the 1996 election is about.
<P>Elections are best for the country when there are clear-cut differences between the parties. Now everything is fuzzed up. Both sides are claiming credit for the budget. Under these circumstances Bill Clinton and Congressional Democrats win hands down. 
<P>It was said of Bill Clinton that he didn't really believe in anything. Indeed, if you follow his rhetoric, he is masterful in appropriating the themes of his opponents. "The era of big government is over," intoned the President in his "State of the Union" speech. But Bill Clinton fought, and fought hard, for liberal federal programs. He fought on principle. He got every single thing he fought for in one way or the other. I haven't even mentioned the wholesale Republican retreat on environmental issues. 
<P>The problem here is that one side was willing to go all out to win. The other side was embarrassed by what it was fighting for. The Republicans didn't want to defend killing the Endowment for the Arts because too many upper class suburban women gave them a hard time. They didn't want to defend killing the Legal Services Corporation because they heard from too many Republican lawyers who were afraid they would get stuck with more pro-bono work. They didn't want to defend cutting off the government subsidy for PBS lest they see one more bumper sticker proclaiming that Newt killed Barney. 
<P>In short, they didn't have the stomach to face down their opponents. Bob Livingston was right. If the House had stood its ground, none of this would have happened because not a penny can be spent by a President which doesn't get money from both houses of Congress.
<P>The voters are going to take it out on the Republicans for their cowardice because it was they who built up expectations to an unreasonable level. The sad thing is that the freshmen, most of whom fought the good fight even against the wishes of their own Leadership, are likely to get hit the hardest by the voter wrath. And when that happens, the assumption will be made that cutting back federal programs is anathema with the voters and cannot be attempted again. 
<P>No Greek drama or Middles Ages morality play ever had a more tragic ending. 
<P>

"Senator Cochrans Exemplary Actions"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
<P>
On occasion, there is honor among politicians and it is worth our taking notice. Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi is Chairman of the Senate GOP Conference. It is one of the top leadership positions in the Senate. He is sort of the Chairman of the Board of all Republican Senators. He has a significant staff. He has occupied the position for six years and no one has even hinted about running against him for that leadership position in the next Congress. Cochran is a shoo-in for a fourth term in the Senate this November.<P> 
But Thad Cochran helped freshmen Senators engineer term limits for the Senate Leadership and Committee Chairmen. As part of a reform package, it was adopted by the majority at the beginning of the 104th Congress last year. Cochran was one of the very few senior Senators to have assisted the freshmen in getting the reforms they sought.<P>
The term limits for Leadership provision grandfathered Cochran and others so the six year time clock would not apply to them for another couple of Congresses. But Thad Cochran is an honorable man. Having been a chief proponent of six year term limits for the Leadership, and his six years as Leader being up at the end of this Congress, Cochran announced that he will not seek re-election as Chairman of the Conference.<P> 
Thus Cochran sets the sort of example inside the Senate which Senator Malcolm Wallop set in 1994 in Wyoming. Wallop was an ardent opponent of term limits. However, the people of Wyoming voted for term limits by more than 70% of the vote. Their vote also grandfathered Wallop, who didn't agree with the outcome, but he felt the people had spoken so he announced that he would abide by their will and retire. That forced the hand of his colleague Alan Simpson who also announced his retirement from the Senate, after three terms, at the end of this Congress. <P>
Cochran's announcement was a thunderbolt in the Senate. Here is a Senator who is actually putting into practice what he says he believes. Cochran's actions will likely effect what other Senators, who have been in the Leadership for many years, will do as well. <P>
One can only speculate what it will mean for Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole. If Dole loses the Presidency, the question of his continued leadership in the Senate will be front and center. Dole was first elected Leader following the 1984 election. He has been either Majority Leader or Minority Leader ever since. 
<P>Cochran's principled actions will put Dole in a box. Even though the reforms passed by Senate Republicans specifically exempt the Majority Leader, will Bob Dole, should he lose the Presidency, dare to come back to his colleagues and say, "Others are leaving after six years, but I want my job back for the 13th and 14th year?" I frankly doubt, now that Cochran has done what he has done, Dole would get by with it. For Dateline Washington, I'm Paul Weyrich.

The Independent Council
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>

When Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh was busy harassing witnesses over Iran-Contra during the Reagan Administration, Democrats cheered. As Independent Counsel Ken Starr conducts his Whitewater trial in Little Rock, Republicans cheer.<P>
What of the ordinary Americans who are not part of the established political parties? Well, in my opinion, they have little to cheer about when it comes to the way the Independent Counsel system functions. It is a system out of control.<P>
In reality, Independent Counsels are accountable to no one. Lawrence Walsh spent $40 million of taxpayers money, obligating his victims to spend millions of their own money defending themselves. For this he got a couple of forced convictions which probably would not have taken place had Walsh's targets not panicked and agreed to plead guilty. The Independent Counsel, investigating former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, went so far afield in his investigation that he even drew a rebuke from the federal judges who appointed him. <P>
I know that Republican partisans are hoping against hope that Independent Counsel Starr will get convictions in Arkansas. However, there is every indication that Governor Tucker, at least, will be found not guilty and that the Starr investigation may collapse thereafter. Meantime, Democratic Senators Harry Reid of Nevada and John Breaux of Louisiana have called on Starr to resign because of alleged conflicts of interest in his private law practice. Among the charges that these Senators and others make is that Starr represented the Bradley Foundation in a Milwaukee school choice case and the Bradley foundation has provided funds for, among other entities, NET. NET, after all, doesn't approve of much of what the Clinton Administration has done. What many think about the work of Independent Counsels depends upon whose ox is being gored.<P>
Against this background, Congressman Jay Dickey, a Democrat turned Republican from Arkansas, has introduced legislation which would require that after two years the Independent Counsel would be subject to the usual oversight process of the Congress. Such counsels would have to come to the Appropriations Committees to seek a renewal of their funding. Moreover, the Dickey legislation would require that Independent Counsels drop outside legal work while serving in that capacity.  This would prevent accusations of conflict of interest.<P>
Dickey's bill is getting a lot of favorable coverage in Arkansas because it is seen as a slap at Ken Starr. But, in fact, Dickey has made it clear that he has high regard for Starr and does not think the charges of conflict of interest against him are meritorious. Dickey is moving on a principle here. He believes, as do I, that no one should be above our system of checks and balances.
<P>Right now Independent Counsels have a blank check to spend as much as they want for as long as they wish. Their mandate is limitless so they often conduct fishing expeditions at the taxpayers expense. Those of us who believe in a rule of law know very well that our Founding Fathers would have a collective heart attack if they saw this system in operation. 
<P>Dickey's bill should be approved by this Republican Congress. The Democrats would have to vote for it. Senate Democrats certainly could not filibuster the legislation after what they have said about Ken Starr. President Clinton, thinking he will be re-elected, will eagerly sign the legislation.
Regardless of who is in power, this bill is necessary because it will end the highly dubious status of these Independent Counsels who have no accountability.
<P>Two years is enough time to pursue a valid investigation if there is substance to charges being made. In that case, an Independent Counsel will have no problem justifying his work and even a partisan Congress, under pressure from the media, will have to continue an appropriate level of funding. 
This legislation restores some badly needed balance to the system.
<P>The problem here is that some in the Republican Leadership rather enjoy seeing President Clinton and his associates twisting in the wind. They have forgotten what it was like to have Lawrence Walsh on his rampage. Now they've gotten their pay-back at the expense of Bill Clinton. But a pay-back in reverse may be coming with a vengeance if Bob Dole gets to be President. 
<P>No partisan advantage is worth the distortion to our constitutional system which the Independent Counsel system represents. This Congress should immediately pass the Dickey initiative. In fact, Dickey's bill doesn't go far enough for me. The whole system should be repealed. But since the votes aren't there to accomplish that, at least the Dickey bill is a step in the right direction. If the Republican leaders have any sense of integrity they will act on the Dickey measure forthwith.

"Republicans Have Lost Their Vigor"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>

<P>These are dark days for the Republicans.<P>
<ul>
<LI> Speaker Newt Gingrich says his party is in a funk.
<LI> Former Cabinet Secretary Bill Bennett says that the campaign of GOP Presidential nominee Bob Dole is uninspiring and unfocused. Bennett suggests that Dole step down as Majority Leader. 
<LI> Liberal attacks on Whitewater prosecutor Kenneth Starr have begun to take hold. The Democrats believe they can now blunt the effects of any convictions which might come out of the current Arkansas trial as well as any revelations from concurrent Senate hearings. 
<LI> Democrats in Congress unite to defeat any and all significant Republican initiatives on any legislation, leaving Bill Clinton in the driver's seat. 
<LI> The respected political analyst Charles Cook now says the Democrats have a one-in-three chance of recapturing the Congress, something which would have been unthinkable six months ago. 
<LI> Organized labor is spending huge sums of money targeting freshmen Republicans on the minimum wage through radio and TV commercials. No comparable spending is countering this from the Republican side.
<LI> Talk show host Rush Limbaugh, one of the most reliable parties supporting Republicans on the air, now says he may file for a trial separation from the Republican party because he doesn't want to be associated with people who are unwilling to stand up and fight for what they say they believe. 
<LI> All polls now show Bill Clinton leading Bob Dole by double digits. Polls also show Democrats in the lead for Congress. 
</UL>
<P>As I say, these are not happy times for Republicans. Rush Limbaugh is on to something. The problem here is not that the electorate has suddenly turned liberal. The problem is not that the so called mainstream media is more vicious than they were during the 1994 election season, for example. The problem is not that the liberals suddenly have a set of ideas which have captured the imaginations of the American people. The problem is not that times are so good that it is inevitable that the incumbent President will win. 
<P>The problem is simply this: The Republicans have lost all passion for their beliefs. A year ago, as they worked through the Contract with America, Republicans fought for their ideas with great conviction and the public was with them. They did so, it turns out, because they were dead certain that Bill Clinton would collapse from the momentum they had started. Republicans had but one battle plan: force Clinton to surrender, then declare victory and go on to the next triumph. 
<P>But Bill Clinton did not surrender. In fact, Bill Clinton rallied his troops. There seems to be a lot of passion left in those who believe in big government. The Republicans collapsed, not Bill Clinton. The Republicans began to compromise and compromise and compromise. The more they gave in, the more the Democrats united in the Senate to stop Republican initiatives. The more the initiatives died, the less the Republicans wanted to continue fighting for them. Now all the intensity is on the side of the Democrats who smell the chance to come back to power in a major way. 
<P>Republicans, meanwhile, are paying lip service to a host of good ideas in which they once insisted they really believed. These range from term limits to cutting out harmful federal programs to medical savings accounts. The problem is that there is no passion behind their rhetoric. They give their supporters little to get excited over. Compare what is happening today to the fight the Republicans waged against Bill and Hillary's health care plan in the 103rd Congress. The intensity back then was all with the Republicans. 
<P>So what happened? What happened is simply this. The mainstream media attacked the Republicans vigorously. Some among their ranks couldn't take the heat. They urged compromise. Republican leaders tried to appease this group through compromise. Democrats, upon hearing of proposed compromises, sensed weakness and decided to go for the jugular. 
<P>Then came the 1995 off-year elections. Republicans lost them. Fear and panic swept their ranks. They offered more compromise, emboldening the Democrats, who managed to get themselves together after having been badly split last year. Republicans, then, all but threw in the towel on a variety of issues, demoralizing their own troops. This, combined with a bruising Republican primary season where all the passion and excitement was with the losing candidates for President, brought us to where we are today. 
<P>Limbaugh is essentially correct. If the Republicans don't want to go all out to fight for their ideas, if they don't want to stand up and defend themselves, and if they don't want to be on the offensive instead of the defensive, then they do not deserve the blind loyalty of Limbaugh or anyone else. Defeat is not inevitable. But as any good coach knows, to win on the playing field you have to believe in your own team. If the Republicans don't believe in their own ideas enough to fight for them, then they shouldn't be surprised when people who believe in contrary ideas, no matter how wrong they may be, end up trouncing them for good. 
<P>If the Republicans keep going where they are going, they will give Limbaugh one more chance to say, "See, I told you so." 
<P>

<h2>
"Liberal Media Bias"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>

<P>
<P>
Speaker Newt Gingrich said yesterday that if the news media really believes so much in affirmative action, they should hire conservative Republicans. Gingrich was reacting to a Freedom Forum study, released by the Gannett-sponsored organization last week, which demonstrates that reporters covering politics and government are predominately liberal. 92% voted for President Clinton, as compared with 43% of the population as a whole. 
<P>
The study reveals something else, however, which is in my view, even more disturbing. It highlights the overwhelming cynicism of the national media toward anyone serving in office. This cynicism is especially pronounced, no doubt, when reporters cover politicians with whom they disagree.
<P>When I worked in the newsroom of a major metropolitan daily during the 1964 Presidential campaign, the reporters were overwhelmingly for the re-election of Lyndon Johnson. In fact, out of a staff of close to 100, I found only four supporters of the Republican nominee, Barry Goldwater. Editorially, the itself supported Goldwater, but the reporters who covered the campaign were against him. <P>

I have to say that, by and large, the professionalism of this group of reporters overcame their bias. Goldwater got fair coverage from the Milwaukee Sentinel despite the views of the reporters covering him.  When President Eisenhower got such a thunderous ovation at the 1964 GOP convention in San Francisco for criticizing the media, he was referring to columnists and editorial writers, not news reporters. Eisenhower suggested that lots of people were giving advice to the Republicans -- pundits who would, themselves, never vote for Republican candidates. The delegates roared their approval. 
<P>Today, the situation is reversed. In most papers the majority of columnists are from the center-right point of view. Even dedicated liberal papers such as the Washington Post and the New York Times have conservative columnists. Where those who believe in limited government, free enterprise, a strong national defense and traditional moral values take it on the chin is on the reportorial side of the equation. The people who cover the news are no longer taught, as they were when I was a reporter, that their personal opinions are not to show up in their reporting. <P>

The change came during Watergate. Prior to that time, there had been a small group of advocacy journalists who had made their way into America's newsrooms. They were in conflict with the traditional journalists who believed that their responsibility was to cover news, not to make news. When the Washington Post brought down the Nixon Administration, the advocacy journalists had won the day. Traditional journalists could no longer prevail because what the advocacy journalists had accomplished was to make the media a fourth and most powerful branch of government. 
<P>From that time to the present, the cynicism of journalists, many of whom do not hide their point of view, is overwhelming. They begin with the presumption that politicians, especially ones with whom they disagree, are guilty. All that remains is for them to identify the wrong the politicians have done. 
<P>
It is inconceivable, in the minds of these reporters, that the freshmen Republicans who got elected in 1994 actually believe in something and want the country to change. Rather, the reporters believe these freshmen have to be serving some special interests. They must be fronting for big money. Or at the very least they are serving their own interests. 
<P>It is not only a liberal bias, but this cynicism, which makes for the sort of coverage that has caused Speaker Gingrich to tell supporters that over the next six months they must become "personal radio stations" to overcome the bias of the media. The preference for liberal and Democratic politicians was in the newsrooms more than 30 years ago. What is different between now and then is that editors back then insisted that personal views be kept out of the news pages. This didn't always happen, of course, but the bias was subdued. Today the bias is blatant. 
<P>The only cure for this in the long run is the market place. Newspapers are in a state of steep decline. Each time new ratings come out, network television has lost some additional viewers to rival cable or direct broadcast channels. At some point, the owners of these media properties will stop being in a state of denial and will begin to examine their coverage. It is then that they may insist once again that advocacy journalism is for opinion columns and commentaries. 
<P>So when reading newspaper coverage makes you so angry you can't see straight, or when watching television news makes you want to smash the set, contribute to the growing market forces which will change the system. Don't buy the paper. And turn off that channel. There are other sources of news. The more you patronize the other sources instead of the ones which distort reality, the sooner the owners of the so-called mainstream media will be forced, for their own economic well being, either to change things or get out of the business.<P>

"Earth Day' its Own Religion"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>

<P>
Thirty-two years ago today, two momentous things happened. Our first
daughter, Dawn Ceol, was born and the first "Earth Day" was proclaimed.
There is no connection between the two, I can assure you, although Dawn has
shown a lot of interest in gardening of late. <P>
It is true enough that we human beings have been given custody of earth and
that we should take appropriate care of what has been entrusted to us. 
But it is also true that in the Book of Genesis, it is clear that man was
given dominion over the earth. There was not a word from God suggesting that
we should preserve everything just as it was created. Quite the contrary,
God gave man an intellect and the ability to develop the earth.<P> 
Rather than a call for us to be responsible, as we continue to make progress
in unlocking what God knows anyway, "Earth Day" has become an ideology or a
substitute religion. The underlying assumption behind this ideology is that
the earth was created in a pristine state and it is man who is the problem.
If only we didn't spoil the earth with our use of resources, then we could
live in the beauty of nature again.<P> 
No one defends the real polluters. No one suggests that all businesses or
individuals have been completely responsible or even efficient in the use of
natural resources. But the idea that we are the problem is a direct denial
of God's word in Genesis. And that is the heart of the conflict over "Earth
Day." <P>
While not all who celebrate this occasion have adopted that philosophy,
those who have created the occasion have a neo-Pantheism at the heart of
what they believe. They worship not the God of creation, but nature itself.
These views are hardly new. We have evidence of similar ideas going back to
ancient times. Since nature is to be elevated, and man is to be subject to
nature, of course private property becomes an outmoded concept.<P> 
Nature, so many of the "Earth Day" advocates believe, cannot be confined to
a single individual but belongs to us all. Private property flies in the
face of this ideology. So behind the niceties of celebrating the beauties of
the natural state of the earth is an attack on the individual and his
rights. Thus it is fair to say that most so-called "Greens" are only green
on the outside. At the core they are red or at least pink.<P> 
When all is said and done there is little difference between what the
radical elements of the "Earth Day" movement believe and what the Marxists
teach. I say teach, because if you have ever visited a Communist nation you
will note that the reality is in stark contrast to Marxist beliefs. This is
especially true about the environment. At all of the international meetings,
the Communists were always pushing the Green agenda. Yet they left their own
nations in environmental ruins. <P>
So on this "Earth Day," while mindful of the importance of taking good care
of what has been entrusted to us temporarily, I prefer to celebrate Dawn's
birthday instead. She has been an outstanding example of what it means to
develop one's God given talents. I'd rather trust Dawn and her good husband
Ed to do good things with the property they own, then to put my trust in an
ideology which defies not only the Scriptures but reality as well. So Happy
Birthday, Dawn. Now get busy in your garden.
<P>

"Another Off-Book Mistake"
</h2>
</center>
<blockquote>


Congressman Bud Shuster (R-Pennsylvania) led a successful effort in the House of Representatives to pass his Truth-in-Budgeting bill by a vote of 284-143. The Shuster measure takes the Transportation Trust Fund out of the budget. This presumably would release more of the money collected through transportation taxes to be spent on local roads and other projects. On the surface that seems fair enough. People pay taxes on gasoline and airline tickets and the money should be spent for projects relating to their taxation.
<P>
The problem is that the transportation trust funds are used to offset other spending in the federal budget. So, in effect, this move means that another $30 billion will have to be cut from discretionary domestic spending to balance the budget if the Shuster measure should become law. That is why Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich (R-Ohio) and Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob Livingston (R-Louisiana) strongly opposed the bill. "We will never eliminate the deficit if we give some programs exalted, protected status," Livingston said.
Another opponent, Rep. Chris Shays (R-Connecticut) said, "While some call it the Truth-in-Budgeting Act, I would call it the Unbalanced Budget Act of 1996 or frankly the Pork Barrel Bill of 1996."
<P>
Shays and Livingston are correct. Even this strongly conservative House of Representatives couldn't bring itself to eliminate the Legal Services Corporation, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, or the National Endowment for the Arts. That being the case, who is going to seriously suggest that this Congress or a subsequent Congress is going to come up with another $30 billion in domestic budget cuts to balance the budget?
<P>
This is just another attempt to hide spending off-book. As Harrison Fox of Citizens for Budget reform has pointed out, the off-book obligations of the federal government are greater than those of the federal budget and in many cases more dangerous because they are hidden from the public. I have complained about the Senate stopping most of the reforms which the House has passed in this Congress. Well, this is one time I hope the Senate doesn't go along with what the House has passed. 

<P>
In theory, Congressman Shuster is right. In practice, this measure would be a disaster and would move us that much further away from ever bringing our budget into balance.
<P>

<P><B><A NAME="ISSUES">THE ISSUES</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>America's tax system is a disgrace. It severely penalizes  productive
economic behavior, especially by savers and investors  whose capital income is
subjected to as many as four layers of taxation.  It is so bewildering that
complying with its increasingly  complex forms, regulations, and other documents
consumes billions  of hours each year. And it imposes staggering economic damage
 reducing economic output by hundreds of billions of dollars  each year. The
real cost, however, is measured in lost jobs,  foregone income, lower living
standards, and reduced economic security.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>But lost prosperity is only part of the story. For many  Americans the most
reprehensible aspect of the current system is the way  it allows special
interests to manipulate the tax code for their  own advantage. Lobbyists with
enough money and access tilt the  playing field, creating special preferences
for the politically  well-connected. With the tax burden at record levels, many
taxpayers  understandably want to protect their earnings, but today's system  of
loopholes, credits, exemptions, and deductions fosters a  pervasive sense of
unfairness and encourages lawmakers to impose  even higher tax rates on income
which does not enjoy special status.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The best way to solve America's tax problem is to adopt a flat  tax. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  No tax system is good for the
economy, but a flat tax would  allow significantly stronger economic growth by
replacing the  current tax code with a low rate, simple tax that removes the
bias  against savings and investment. Perhaps equally important, it would 
restore integrity to a tax system that has become synonymous  with
special-interest corruption. Under the flat tax, every taxpayer  plays by the
same rules. The multitude of forms required by today's  arcane tax law are
replaced by two simple postcards, one for  individuals' labor income and the
other for business and capital  income. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1995, the new Congress took a significant step in the right  direction by
delivering on its promise to pass badly needed  family tax relief to spur
economic growth. Taxpayers were  disappointed, however, when  just two years
after signing the largest tax  hike in U.S. history  President Clinton vetoed
the Balanced  Budget Act of 1995, which included about $220 billion in tax
relief over  a seven-year period. This relatively small package  which  amounts
to returning to the taxpayer just 2 cents of every dollar from  the $11.5
trillion in tax revenues the government expects to  collect over the next seven
years  included a $500-per-child tax credit,  a reduction in the capital gains
tax, and a modest expansion of  Individual Retirement Accounts. This legislation
marked the first  time since 1981 that Congress had voted to ease the tax
burden, but  it still did not come close to offsetting the negative impact of 
tax increases imposed by Presidents George Bush and Bill Clinton  in 1990 and
1993; the 1995 tax cut was less than one-third the  combined size of these two
tax increases.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P> 
<P>As important as Congress's proposed tax cuts were to  taxpayers 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  and economic growth, they amounted
to using a Band-Aid  when what the situation really required was radical
surgery.  Serious, fundamental reform must be based on a recognition of two 
essential realities: Excessive taxation harms the economy, and the  liberal
notion that any problem can be solved by taxing the rich  is self-defeating.
Higher tax rates simply encourage wealthy  taxpayers, who already are
over-taxed, to hide, shelter, underreport,  and reduce their income. A much
better way to get the rich to  pay more, and one that will help lower - and
middle-income  workers by boosting savings and investment, is to cut tax rates.
The  attached <a href="tax_1.gif">chart</a> illustrates how lower tax rates in the 1980s  dramatically
increased the percentage of the income tax burden borne  by the rich. Even more
important, however, these reductions  triggered the longest peacetime economic
expansion in U.S. history and  led to the creation of 21 million new jobs.

<P>
</P>
<P>The conclusion is obvious: The tax system today is so  fundamentally flawed
that the only realistic solution is to scrap it and  begin again.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>These flaws in the current tax code can be communicated by  emphasizing
three main themes:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>1. Excessive tax rates.</B> The federal income tax has a top rate  of
39.6 percent. This means that successful entrepreneurs and  others with high
incomes receive barely 60 cents of benefit for every  dollar they contribute to
the nation's economy. The result is less  incentive to engage in productive
behavior, which leads in turn  to lower levels of work, saving, investment,
risk-taking, and  entrepreneurship. Added to this are state and local taxes,
which can  increase the total burden by as much as 11 percent, and the  Medicare
payroll tax, which adds another 2.9 percent. Moreover, while  those with lower
incomes may seem to be penalized less, usually  facing income tax rates of 15
percent and 28 percent, they also are  subjected to the full 15.3 percent
payroll tax, <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt2.htm#1">1</A></B></TT> in
addition to state  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  local taxes. In other words,
almost all taxpayers are paying  about 40 percent of each additional dollar of
income they earn to  the government.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>According to the Tax Foundation, the average taxpayer in  1995 worked until
May 6 to satisfy the revenue demands of  federal, state, and local government.
This number could have dropped by  a day or two in 1996 if the President had
signed the legislation  approved by Congress in 1995. Nevertheless, the cost of
the tax  system remains the largest item in the average family's budget, 
exceeding the combined cost of food, clothing, shelter, and  transportation. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2. Complexity.</B> Americans spend too much time deciphering  IRS forms,
regulations, and rulings. Several years ago, an  IRS-commissioned study
estimated that taxpayers spend 5.4 billion hours  on their federal tax returns 
more than all the man-hours used in  the entire automotive industry in America.
According to the  Tax Foundation, our tax system imposes $192 billion in 
compliance costs on the economy: not money sent to Washington, not  foregone
economic growth, but the cost of the lawyers,  accountants, lobbyists, tax
preparers, and man-hours needed to comply with  the current tax code. Of this
amount, three-quarters is due to the  federal income tax alone.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>3. Bias against savings and investment.</B> The current system 
discourages Americans from saving and investing. Perhaps the  most pernicious
feature of the tax code is the way it subjects capital  income to discriminatory
treatment. If a taxpayer earns a dollar,  he can choose (after paying tax on the
money) to consume that  income or use it for savings and investment. If he
consumes the  dol
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 -->  lar, he will pay very little, if
any, additional federal tax. If  he chooses to invest his earnings, he is
treated like a criminal.  Depending on the type of investment, the government
may  subject any returns to as many as four additional layers of tax; needless 
to say, however, it does not share in any losses if the investment  does not
perform as expected. Not only is this policy unfair, but it  has profoundly
adverse consequences for the economy since all  economic theories agree that the
only way to generate higher  wages and rising living standards is through
savings and investment.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>How Taxes Slow the Economy and Cost Jobs </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The biggest long-term problem with the tax system is its impact  on income
and productivity. Although much has been made of a  supposed decline in
middle-class incomes over the last 20 years,  all income groups have seen their
incomes rise over time.  However, our current tax system has made this increase
smaller than it  could have been.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There is almost universal agreement among economists   even Marxists  that
incomes depend on productivity. Workers are  paid on the basis of what they
produce. Put another way, for incomes  to rise, productivity must increase, but
productivity increases  are closely linked to savings and to investment in
capital and  labor. Thus, the ability of workers to produce more is a function
of  increases in the quantity and quality of the machinery, tools,  equipment,
and technology with which they work. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The only systematic way to increase living standards and  income over time
is through more savings and investment in capital  and labor; in other words, in
the language of economics,  increased 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  capital formation boosts the
productivity of labor. Capital and  labor are what economists call complementary
goods, because  the value of each increases when they are linked together. A 
citizen who invests money in a pension fund will get a good return on  that
money if it is put to work producing goods. Labor, conversely,  will receive
higher wages as a result of the new investment made  possible by those
retirement savings.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>This link between labor and capital explains why farmers  in America earn
more than farmers in Bangladesh. American  farmers do not work harder. They are
not smarter. They earn more  because they produce more, and they produce more
because they work  with sophisticated machinery, equipment, tools, technology,
and  production processes. This is also why factory workers in  America,
Germany, and Japan earn more than factory workers in  Brazil, Nigeria, and
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Unfortunately, our tax code imposes particularly harsh penalties  on
so-called capital income. Consider, for example, a family that  decides to
sacrifice by setting aside 10 percent of its income in  order to build up a
retirement nest egg. It invests the money in a  new company, exposing itself to
the possible loss of all its savings.  One would assume the government would
want to reward this type  of entrepreneurial decision, but just the opposite is
the case. If  the family's investment turns out to be a wise one, the 
government imposes at least three, and sometimes four, levels of tax. First, 
any income of the new company is subject to the corporate income  tax; second,
when the money is paid out as a dividend to the  shareholder, the income is
subject to the personal income tax; third,  if the family ever decides to sell
its stock, it must pay a tax on  capital gains; and fourth, if this family
invested very wisely and  helped 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 -->  create tomorrow's Microsoft, the
government will tax the value  of its assets through the estate tax as its
members die. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As bad as all this sounds, it gets even worse. Policies such as  the
alternative minimum tax and depreciation often force  businesses and individuals
to overstate their income, making the real tax  rate even higher than the
statutory top rate. Our hypothetical  family could try to avoid some of these
taxes by simply putting money  in the bank, but even this has high costs. First,
the rate of return  on their savings will be lower because excessive taxes lower
the  demand for credit. Second, the government double taxes  savings. With the
exception of strictly limited IRAs and a handful of  other savings plans like
401(k)s, the money put into savings accounts  is taxed when it is deposited and
taxed on any interest it earns.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Needless to say, this pernicious anti-savings, anti-investment  bias in the
tax code sharply reduces the level of capital  formation. Many taxpayers look at
how the government punishes  success, decide that the financial sacrifice is not
worth it, and  consume their income rather than save and invest it. Ironically,
many  of these tax policies are designed to punish the &quot;rich,&quot; since 
they naturally have more money available for savings and  investment. The main
effect, however, is to reduce the wages and salaries  of people with lower and
middle incomes. Most wealthy people  can use tax shelters like municipal bonds
or hide their money  offshore to avoid taxes targeted at the so-called rich.
What these taxes  really do is discourage those on the lower rungs of the 
economic ladder from trying to become rich.
</P>
<P>
</P> 
<P>By contrast, the tax cuts of the 1980s show what happens if  tax 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  policy reduces the burden on
working, saving, and investing.  Once the economy received an unambiguous tax
cut, everything  President Reagan said would happen if tax rates were reduced
began  to happen. The economy began its longest period of growth in  peacetime
history. Incomes began to rise, with the increase benefiting  all groups  rich,
middle-class, and lower-income (see <a href="tax_3.gif">chart</a>). And,  of course, the miraculous job
creation machine began: 21 million  new jobs were created during the Reagan
boom.

</P>
<P><B>How Washington has Hiked Taxes on  Children  </B><TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt2.htm#2">2</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Federal taxation of families with children has increased  dramatically over
the past four decades. In 1948, the typical family of  four paid just 3 percent
of its income to the federal government in  direct taxes. In 1994, the
equivalent family paid 24.5 percent of  its income to the federal government. As
the <a href="tax_2.gif">chart</a> below  shows, when state and local and indirect federal taxes are
included, the  tax burden on that family equals 37.6 percent of its income.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Federal income taxes have risen much faster for families with  children than
for other groups of Americans in the last four  decades. The root cause of this
growing anti-family bias is the  eroding value of the personal exemption. The
personal exemption for  children was intended to offset part of the annual cost
of raising  a child by allowing families to deduct an amount of money  from
their taxable income. In 1948, the personal exemption was  $600. This was equal
to roughly 17 percent of the median income of  a family of four (then $3,468)
and shielded 68 percent of  that family's income from federal income tax.
Families could  protect most of the remaining 32 percent by itemizing deductions
or  by taking the standard deduction. The result: In the late 1940s  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  early 1950s, the average family
with children paid little or no  income tax.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In the past four decades, however, increases in the personal  exemption have
lagged far behind the rise in incomes and  inflation. As the value of the
personal exemption has declined, the  income tax paid by families with children
has increased. For the  personal exemption today to have the same value relative
to family  income that it had in 1948, it would have to have risen to $7,000 in 
1992, and to $8,000 in 1996. Instead, it is worth only $2,250 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The second blow to family finances has been the increase in  Social Security
taxes, technically known as &quot;payroll taxes.&quot;  In  1948, workers paid a
2 percent Social Security tax on annual wages of  up to $3,000; 1 percent was
paid directly by the employee and 1  percent indirectly by the employer through
the so-called  employer share.<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt2.htm#3">3</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>By 1995, combined Social Security taxes have risen to 15.3  percent of wages
(7.65 percent each paid by employer and  employee) on incomes up to $61,200.
While all workers have suffered  from skyrocketing payroll taxes, the burden has
been most severe  for working families with children. Social Security taxes,
unlike  regular income taxes, are not adjusted for the number of dependents  in
the family, so a working parent trying to support a family of  four feels the
sting of this tax far more sharply than a single person  at the same wage level.
The effect of Social Security taxation is  particularly severe on lower-income
parents; a family with an  income of $25,000 per year, for instance, pays $3,825
in payroll taxes.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 --> 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>The Government Assault on Family Income. Direct federal  taxes as a share of
median family income has increased  dramatically over the past four decades. In
1948, effective tax rates equaled  3 percent of income for the average family of
four. By 1970,  they had risen to 16 percent; by 1994, to 24.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The income loss due to increased taxation has seriously  strained American
family finances and profoundly affected American  family life. Chart 4 shows the
effects of increases in federal  income and Social Security taxes since 1948 on
the finances of the  average family. Total pre-tax income for the median family
of four in  1994 was $56,608. <B><TT><A HREF="ftnt2.htm">4</A></TT></B>
 After taxes, this family's income fell to $45,104.  If federal taxes as a
percentage of family income were restored  to 1948 levels, the family's post-tax
income would have  been $10,084 higher, or $55,188. In other words, the loss of
income  in 1992 because of the increase in federal taxes as a share of  family
income, due to the falling value of the personal exemption and  the rise in
Social Security taxes since the late 1940s, was $10,084.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This income loss severely affects the ability of families to  support
themselves. For example, the typical family of four has  monthly mortgage
payments of $664 and grocery bills of $332. Thus  the $10,084 in income lost to
this family due to the 45-year rise  in federal taxes costs this family 15
months worth of mortgage  payments, or 12 months mortgage combined with six
months worth  of groceries.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Solution: Tax Credits for Children</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There are two practical ways to reduce the tax burden on  families with
children: by increasing the value of the personal exemption  or 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  by allowing for the use of tax
credits. Although many positive  arguments can be made for increasing the
personal exemption,  the tax credit is better in the long run because it is less
complex  and can be used more effectively to reduce the tax burden on 
lower-income working families.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>With an income tax exemption, income equal to the amount of  the exemption
is excluded from tax. However, the actual tax savings  a family receives from
such an exemption will depend upon the  tax rate to which it is subject. Thus,
for a family in the 15 percent  income tax bracket, a $500 increase in the
dependent exemption  decreases income taxes by $75. A $1,000 increase in the 
exemption, as some have proposed, decreases a family's tax burden by  $150. But
for a family in the 28 percent tax bracket, a $1,000 increase  in the personal
exemption reduces the income tax burden by $280   86 percent more tax relief
than for families in the 15  percent bracket.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>By contrast, under a tax credit, the amount of the credit is  deducted from
taxes paid  below the line, so to speak  directly  reducing tax liability. Also,
unlike a tax exemption, a credit gives the  same amount of tax relief to every
taxpayer, regardless of income or  tax rate status. The two examples below, one
for a family of four  earning $30,000 per year and the other for the same family
 earning $75,000 per year, show clearly how the credit works.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Example #1:</B> Under current law, a family earning $30,000 per  year
(which puts it in the 15 percent income tax bracket) has an  income tax
liability of $1,988. Because this family has two children,  the $500 child tax
credit reduces the income tax bill by $1,000  leaving a net income tax bill of
$988. This is a 50 percent reduction in  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->  family's tax burden.
</P>
<P>
</P> 
<P><B>Example #2:</B> Under current law, a family earning $75,000 per  year
(which puts it in the 28 percent income tax bracket) has a tax  liability of
$8,114. Deducting $1,000  $500 for each child   leaves this family with a net
income tax bill of $7,114. This is a 11  percent reduction in the family's tax
burden.

<P><B>The Crushing Burden of Social Security</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Much of this chapter has focused on the crushing burden of  taxes in general
and the anti-growth features of the income tax in  particular. No treatment of
federal taxation would be complete,  however, without some discussion of the
interrelated problems of  the payroll tax and the Social Security retirement
system. The need  for reform is critical. The Bipartisan Entitlement Commission 
estimates that Social Security faces an unfunded liability of $7.3  trillion.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     The burden of financing Social
Security has reached crisis  proportions. First, the payroll tax rate has risen
dramatically over  time. As the attached chart illustrates, the payroll tax has
jumped from  2 percent in 1949 to 15.3 percent today (the government  promotes
the fiction that half is paid by the employer and half by the  employee; in
reality, of course, the full burden is borne by the  worker in the form of lower
take-home pay). Of the 15.3 percent  payroll tax, 12.4 percent is dedicated to
Social Security, and 2.9 percent  is used to finance Medicare spending.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     The rapidly rising tax rate is only part of the
problem. When  Social Security was created in the 1930s, only the first $3,000
of  in
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 -->  come was subject to tax. As the
graph demonstrates, however,  the amount of income subject to tax has
skyrocketed to more  than $60,000. The combination of these two effects  higher
tax  rates and an increase in the amount of wages that can be taxed   has caused
the payroll tax to become the biggest tax burden for  the majority of taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     In 1937, the maximum tax bill for the program
was $60.  Twenty years later, in 1957, the maximum tax bill was less than $170. 
By 1977, it had climbed to more than $1,600. Today, a worker's  Social Security
tax bill can reach more than $7,500. The 2.9  percent Medicare portion of the
payroll tax compounds the burden,  particularly because there is no limit on the
amount of income  subject to this additional levy. This spiraling tax bill has a
negative  economic impact. The payroll tax is an unambiguous hindrance to  job
creation, lowering take-home pay and reducing the level of  labor-force
participation.

<P>The other major flaw in the Social Security system is that it  is bankrupt.
Simply stated, the Social Security system has  promised benefits that cannot be

</P>
<P><B>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1993, with nary a vote to spare in either the House or the  Senate,
President Clinton managed to obtain approval for the  largest tax increase in
history. In his second year, 1994, he proposed   but ultimately failed to get
enacted  an even larger tax increase  to pay for his government-run health care
scheme. Then, on  December 16, 1994, shortly after the mid-term elections that
put a  Republican majority in the House for the first time in 40 years, the 
President reversed himself and proposed a &quot;Middle-Class Bill  of Rights&quot;
which included modest tax cuts for families with  children, tax deductions for
education expenses, and an expansion of  Individual Retirement Accounts. This
effort was short-lived,  however, because the Administration spent much of the
rest of 1995  opposing the tax cuts proposed by the Republican Congress.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton's record tax increase was a complete failure.  Tax
revenues are rising slower than they did during the  tax-cutting Reagan years.
The Clinton tax hike also hindered deficit  reduction. The following chart shows
CBO projections of annual budget  deficits after the Clinton tax increase. After
a modest decline, due  primarily to the economy's slow climb out of the early
1990s  slow
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 16 -->  down, projected budget deficits
begin to climb rapidly,  reaching more than $400 billion after the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Higher taxes also slow income growth for American families.  The following
charts illustrate the strong relationship between  taxes and family incomes.
During the Reagan years, income rose,  reversing the dismal economic performance
of the Carter years  when payroll tax hikes and bracket creep resulted in major
tax  increases. Unfortunately, Ronald Reagan's pro-growth policies were 
reversed by the Bush and Clinton Administrations. The effect on  the economy was
both predictable and inevitable: Incomes again  began to fall. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>During the 1980s, Reagan's opponents charged that the rich  were getting
richer and the poor were getting poorer. As the  numbers clearly show, however,
all income classes benefited from  the economy's performance. For the most part,
conversely, all  income classes suffer when the economy falters. The only
exception to  this trend has been during the Clinton Administration when, for 
the first time, the rich actually have become richer as the poor  have grown
poorer. The lesson from these statistics is clear:  Higher taxes slow the
economy, but the rich usually can adjust their  affairs to limit the damage,
leaving the poor most vulnerable to  the downturn.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Reagan Years</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Some Americans have been seduced into thinking that the tax  burden is too
low. They have been told, often by the  establishment media, that &quot;Reagan
era&quot; tax cuts starved the government of  revenue and that higher taxes are
needed simply to offset the effect  of 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 17 -->  these the massive cuts. 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>As Chart 8 illustrates, however, there was no loss of tax  revenue during
the Reagan years. The effect is particularly  pronounced when one realizes that
the Reagan tax cuts were phased in, and  the economy did not actually receive a
net tax cut until January  1, 1983.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Even using 1981 as the base year (and effectively blaming  Reagan for the
recession that began during Carter's last fiscal year),  tax revenues expanded
from $599 billion in 1981 to $991 billion  in 1989. Even after adjusting for
inflation, revenues grew by 20  percent. Compare this to the level of revenue
growth under the  high-tax regimes of Bush and Clinton. As the <a href="tax_8.gif">chart</a> shows, tax 
revenues grew faster under the Reagan tax cuts than they have in  recent years
under higher tax rates.<TT><B><A HREF="ftnt2.htm#7">7</A></B></TT></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Critics claim that the Reagan tax cuts caused the deficit to  climb, but
this accusation does not withstand scrutiny. As the  following graph shows, the
deficit began to increase two fiscal years  before Ronald Reagan became
President and continued to rise during  his first two years in office, until the
economy received a  significant net tax cut on January 1, 1983. From that point
on, the deficit  began to shrink, falling to about $150 billion by the time
Reagan  left office.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Perhaps most important of all, the deficit would have continued  to fall had
Reagan's policies been left in place. In January 1989   the month Ronald Reagan
left office  the Democratically  controlled Congressional Budget Office
published estimates showing  what would happen to the deficit if Reagan's
policies were left in  place. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 -->  As <a href=tax_10.gif">Chart 10</a> shows, the CBO
projected that the deficit would  continue to fall every year. Unfortunately,
both George Bush and  Bill Clinton raised taxes, causing economic growth to
falter and  discouraging taxpayers from earning and reporting more taxable 
income, and the deficit increased.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The evidence is clear. Notwithstanding all the Washington  rhetoric, the tax
burden is too high. The deficit is the result of  excessive spending, not low
tax rates. The evidence of the past 20 years  confirms that high tax rates and
rising tax burdens mean higher  deficits.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Abandoned Families</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Clinton campaigned for President by promising to give tax cuts  to working
families with children, but he did little to honor  this promise until after the
electorate brought new leadership to  Congress in 1994. Almost one year after
introducing his  &quot;Middle-Class Bill of Rights,&quot; Clinton again
abandoned families when he  vetoed the Balanced Budget Act of 1995, which had as
its centerpiece  a $500-per-child tax credit for working families. Clinton 
claimed, among other things, that proposed reforms in the earned  income tax
credit (EITC) included in the plan would raise taxes on  families earning less
than $30,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Yet a comparison of President Clinton's &quot;Middle-Class Bill  of Rights&quot;
(with its $300-per-child tax credit for dependent  children below age 13 in
families with annual incomes below  $75,0008) and the Balanced Budget Act vetoed
by Clinton (with its  $500-per-child tax cut forall children in families earning
up to  $110,0009) shows that the congressional plan would benefit 5.4 million 
more 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  low-income working families with
children than the Clinton  plan, even after accounting for changes in the EITC
in the  Balanced Budget Act. Many families with children and annual incomes 
below $24,000 would be denied the $300 child credit under  the Clinton plan
(receiving only the EITC) but would be eligible  for both the $500 child credit
and the EITC under the  congressional plan.
</P>
<P>
</P> 
<P>Overall, Congress's $500-per-child tax credit would benefit  23 million more
children than the Administration's  $300-per-child credit. Congress would give
tax relief to 10.4 million families  with children who would receive no tax
relief under the Clinton plan.  In addition, there would be millions of families
under the  Clinton plan in which at least one sibling received tax relief but
others  did not. Taken together, the number of children not qualifying for  any
tax relief under Clinton would be 23 million less than under  the Balanced
Budget Act. These children would receive $15.4  billion in tax relief under the
BBA but nothing under the Clinton plan.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There are three major reasons why the Clinton plan denies tax  relief to so
many families with children:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reason #1:</B> Clinton's tax cut benefits only families with  children
under age 13, denying tax relief to the families of at least 2.8  million other
children whose parents earn less than $30,000 per year. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reason #2:</B> Clinton's tax cut phases out for families earning 
between $60,000 and $75,000 per year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reason #3:</B> The Clinton plan requires low-income families to  deduct
their EITC benefits from their income tax bill before  taking 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 20 -->  the $300-per-child tax credit. By
contrast, the Balanced  Budget Act allows a low-income family to take the
$500-per-child  tax credit first, then receiving the full measure of the EITC on
top  of the child credit. <B><TT><A HREF="ftnt2.htm#10">10</A></TT></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>These three elements of the Clinton plan make it substantially  inferior to
Congress's $500-per-child tax credit, even considering  the reforms in the EITC.

<P>THE 104TH CONGRESS
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The centerpiece of the new Congress's Contract With  America was a
commitment to pass a plan that balances the budget by  2002, provides
substantial tax relief to families with children and  seniors, creates jobs, and
spurs economic growth. The new House  leadership rightly understood that tax
cuts must be included in any  credible balanced budget plan for both economic
and political  reasons. First, cutting taxes gives the economy a needed boost
while  Washington curbs spending in order to balance the budget.  Economic
models show that cutting taxes while balancing the budget  produces higher
economic growth than balancing the budget  without tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There also is a political element to cutting taxes while  balancing the
budget. Tax cuts  especially broad-based cuts such as  the $500-per-child tax
credit and capital gains reform  build  powerful constituencies to counter the
entrenched interests who  survive by exploiting government programs. In the
absence of tax  cuts, these pro-spending lobbies would be the only voices heard 
during any debate over balancing the budget. So, too, tax cuts  &quot;sugar-coat&quot;
the political pain of spending cuts. For example, families  in the typical
congressional district would receive some $54  million per year from the
$500-per-child tax credit. It is difficult to  imagine that any single federal
spending project of similar  magnitude could benefit as many constituents at the
same time. Thus, the  political advantages of tax cuts more than outweigh the
political  disadvantages of cutting spending.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 22 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The good news for hard-pressed families and businesses is that  tax cuts
were at the forefront of the agenda during the 1995-1996  budget debate and that
the new Congress fulfilled its promise to  deliver a balanced budget plan with
tax cuts to Bill Clinton. The  bad news is that Clinton vetoed the balanced
budget and tax cut plan   just two years after signing the largest tax increase
in history   and that the vision of taking taxpayers' money back from 
Washington became a victim of the &quot;green eyeshade&quot; negotiations over
how  to balance the budget.

<P><B>Tax Cuts in the House Plan</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On May 18, 1995, the House of Representatives passed, by a  vote of 238 to
193, its sweeping budget blueprint  formally known  as the budget resolution  to
balance the budget in seven years  while providing over $350 billion in tax cuts
to help families with  children and seniors and spur economic growth. Although 
many Washington insiders charged that the projected tax cut was  too large (some
$354 billion over seven years), it amounted to  returning to taxpayers only 3
percent of the $11.5 trillion in total  tax revenues the government expects to
collect over the same  seven-year period.

<P>Unfortunately, the Senate-passed budget resolution failed to  provide
explicit tax cuts. The Senate plan did allow for  unspecified tax cuts for
families and economic growth, but only if CBO  certified that the plan would
balance the budget in seven years.  Once this certification had been made, tax
cuts could be financed  with the $170 billion economic windfall, or &quot;fiscal
dividend,&quot; the  CBO estimated would accrue to the government from lower 
interest rates and the increased tax revenues generated by higher  economic
growth.

<P><B>Tax Cuts in the Balanced Budget Act of 1995</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>After considerable negotiation, the House and Senate agreed  that the
Balanced Budget Act of 1995 (BBA) should contain $245  billion in tax cuts to
help families and spur economic growth. The  net size of this tax cut package is
reduced to $218 billion after  deducting $27 billion in revenues generated from
closing special  tax breaks for certain corporations and industries. Though this
 plan has come under considerable criticism from the media and  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 24 -->  Washington elite, it actually is
rather modest: Overall, it  promises to return to taxpayers roughly 2 percent of
the $11.5 trillion in  tax revenues the government expects to collect over the
next  seven years. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A full 65 percent of the tax cut plan is targeted to families,  especially
families with children. The &quot;crown jewel&quot; is a  $500-per-child tax
credit benefiting 28 million families raising 51  million children. The
remaining 35 percent of the plan is dedicated to  tax cuts to spur new
investment, jobs, and economic growth. A  small portion of the plan includes two
important tax provisions to  help seniors with their health care costs.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>The centerpiece of the Republican Contract With America and  of
the House-passed plan is a $500-per-child tax credit benefiting  28 million
working families raising some 51 million children.  The $500-per-child credit is
&quot;non-refundable,&quot; meaning the total  value of the credit may not
exceed a family's income tax bill. But it  does provide uniform tax relief to
all families with incomes up  to $110,000 per year, thereby reducing a
low-income family's  tax burden by a much greater proportion than an 
upper-income family's. For taxpayers filing jointly with incomes  above
$110,000, the credit phases out at a rate of $25 for each $1,000  in earnings
above the threshold (a range of $20,000), phasing  out fully at $130,000 in
income. For families with two children,  the two credits for which they are
eligible are phased out fully  at

<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Families with children are overtaxed.</B> In 1948, the
average  American family with children paid only 3 percent of its income to 
Uncle Sam. Today, the same family pays 24.5 percent.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Giving a family of four a $500-per-child tax credit is equivalent  to
giving that family one month's mortgage payment and  one month's groceries.</B>
The average family spends $644 per month  in mortgage payments and $332 per
month on groceries. Thus,  the $1,000 in tax relief the congressional plan would
give to a  family with two children would help this family pay one month's 
mortgage and groceries.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Millions of families stand to benefit.</B> The families of 51  million
American children (28 million taxpaying families) are eligible  for the
$500-per-child tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Family tax relief helps families in every state.</B> The typical 
congressional district has some 117,000 children in families eligible for  a
$500 tax credit. Thus, families in the typical district would  receive $54
million per year in tax relief. Tables showing the benefits  of family tax
relief by state and congressional district are included  in the appendix to this
chapter.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Congress's $500-per-child tax credit would eliminate the  entire income
tax burden for 3.5 million taxpayers caring for 8.7  million 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 26 -->  children.</B> These 3.5 million
families would receive over $2.2  billion per year in tax relief. Families with
two children earning up  to $24,000 per year would see their entire income tax
burden  eliminated by a $500-per-child tax credit, and families with three 
children and incomes as high as $26,000 also would have their  income tax bill
eliminated.

<P>

<P><B>Most families are middle-class</B>. The $500 child credit directs  89
percent of all benefits to families with adjusted gross incomes  below $75,000
per year  middle-income by any standard   and over 96 percent to families with
incomes below $100,000.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Cutting taxes for all families  regardless of income  is  fair.</B>
Congress's plan would cut the income tax burden of a family  of four earning
$30,000 per year by 51 percent and the income  tax burden of a family earning
$40,000 per year by 30 percent.  Meanwhile, a family of four earning $75,000
would see their tax  burden reduced by 12 percent, and a family earning $100,000
per  year would receive a tax cut of just 7.4 percent.

<P>Under current law, dual-income married couples who file a  joint return can
end up paying more taxes than two single  taxpayers filing individually. The BBA
takes a small step toward  reducing this &quot;marriage penalty&quot; by
increasing the value of the  standard deduction for these working couples
relative to the value of  the same deduction for singles. In 1996, for instance,
the ratio of  the standard deduction for married couples would be 1.68 of the

<P>The estimated two million families ready to adopt children  face huge
expenses during the adoption process, but current tax  law does not allow them
to deduct adoption costs from their tax  bill. The BBA plan makes a substantial
commitment to  encouraging adoption by giving adoptive families a tax credit of
$5,000 to  offset such expenses as adoption fees, court costs, attorneys' fees, 
and other related expenses. This credit is available in full to  families
earning up to $75,000 per year and phased out gradually for  families earning up
to $115,000 per year.

<P><B>4. Tax Deduction for Dependent Parents.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The current tax code provides little relief for the care of  elderly parents
or grandparents. The standard personal exemption  of $2,500 is available, but,
as with the dependent child  exemption, the value of the credit is greater for
middle - and  upper-income families than for modest-income families in the 15
percent  income bracket. For example, while the standard deduction of $2,500 
allows a family in the 15 percent bracket to lower its income tax  by $375, the
same deduction allows a family in the 28 percent  bracket to lower its tax by
$700.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The BBA plan offers additional tax relief for the care of  parents and
grandparents in the form of an &quot;above-the-line&quot; deduction  of $1,000
per family member. Such a credit could help many  families 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 28 -->  that prefer to care for elderly
relatives at home but cannot  afford the expense.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>5. Favorable Tax Treatment for Private Long-Term Care.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Although medical expenses are deductible from federal taxes  when they
exceed a certain percentage of income, long-term care  expenses today generally
are not tax-deductible. Under the  BBA, starting in 1996, long-term care
insurance generally would  be treated the same as accident and health insurance,
and  employers would be allowed to provide their employees with tax-free 
long-term care insurance just as they now often provide medical  benefits.
Eligible long-term care premiums and expenses for  qualified long-term care
services would be treated the same as other  medical expenses, and benefits
received under a long-term care  insurance policy would be tax-free (up to $175
per day).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Placing long-term care benefits on the same basis as health  care and
financing them under tax provisions similar to those for  medical insurance
could lead to substantial savings for state and  federal programs supporting
nursing home care.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>6. Accelerated Payment of Life Insurance Benefits for the  Terminally
Ill.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Under current law, life insurance benefits are not taxed, but  insured
individuals and their families have no way to obtain  benefits prior to death
without a severe income tax liability  even  though many insurance companies are
willing to offer such  &quot;accelerated 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 29 -->  benefits.&quot;  The BBA tax cut
plan would facilitate the practice  by which some insurance providers pay
benefits prior to death if  the insured person is terminally or chronically ill.
The plan would  allow such payments to be excluded from a taxpayer's gross 
income, just as payments to a surviving beneficiary now are. In addition,  it
would allow similar tax-exempt treatment for amounts  received from the sale or
assignment of a life insurance contract to a  qualified settlement provider.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>7. Reduction in Capital Gains Tax.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The U.S. tax code punishes capital investment by taxing  investment income
more than once: twice by taxing corporate and  individual income, and then a
third time by taxing capital gains.  The current maximum tax rate on capital
gains is 28 percent for  individuals and 35 percent for corporations, and these
gains are  not indexed to the inflation rate. By contrast, most of America's 
major economic competitors, such as Japan or Germany, either  exempt capital
gains from taxation or tax them at a greatly reduced  rate, often indexing the
basis of the gains to inflation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The BBA lessens this penalty in two ways. First, it lowers the  effective
maximum capital gains rate to 19.8 percent for  individuals and 28 percent for
corporations. Second, starting January 1,  2001, it permits individuals to index
the value of assets to ensure  that they are not being taxed on purely
inflationary gains. The bill  also includes a 14 percent maximum rate for the
sale of small  business stock by a taxpayer other than a corporation. A
qualifying  small business may not have gross assets of more than $50 million at
 the time the stock is issued. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 30 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As will be seen below, these measures would have a  substantial impact on
the long-term growth of the economy while the  budget is being balanced.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>8. New Individual Retirement Accounts.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In addition to Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), the bill  offers
another way for taxpayers to preserve the value of this  retirement savings by
creating a new American Dream IRA (AD  IRA). Contributions would be made from
post-tax income, but the  interest from such savings would not be taxed upon
withdrawal if  contributions have remained in the account for at least five
years  and the retiree has reached age 59 1/2. This is why the  American Dream
Savings account is sometimes known as a  &quot;back-ended&quot; IRA. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Initially, contributions to the new ADS account would be  limited to $2,000
per taxpayer per year ($4,000 for a married couple),  but this amount would be
indexed to the rate of inflation in  subsequent years. The plan also allows
penalty-free withdrawals for a  first-time home purchase or to pay certain
educational or medical  expenses.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>9. Alternative Minimum Tax. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Current tax law imposes an alternative minimum tax (AMT)  on certain
individuals and corporations whose tax liability, after  deductions and credits,
falls below the level specified by the  alternative minimum tax rate. For
individuals, the minimum tax is  im
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 -->  posed at graduated rates of 26
and 28 percent; for corporations,  it is imposed at 20 percent. In computing
their AMT, individuals  and corporations must adjust the annual amount they
deduct for  depreciated assets so that their tax liability does not fall below
the  AMT amount. 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>The bill modifies the AMT for both individual and corporate  taxpayers by
repealing the depreciation adjustment for  property placed in service after
1995, thereby conforming AMT  depreciation methods with the method used for
regular tax  purposes. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt2.htm#11">11</A></B></TT>

<P>
</P>
<P><B>10. Estate and Gift Tax Reform
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The BBA makes several important changes in the estate and  gift tax code to
reduce the punishing effects of this tax on estates,  especially the estates of
small businesses and farms. The bill  gradually increases the current effective
exemption of $600,000  to $750,000 in $25,000 increments through 2001, after
which  the effective exemption amount is indexed to inflation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For the estates of small businesses, which do not have special  tax rules,
the bil effectively excludes an amount equal to $1.75  million of the business's
value from the decedent's  estate. <TT><B><A

<P><B>Economic Benefits of the Tax Cuts</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Washington insiders, especially those within the White House  and some in
Congress, argued throughout 1995 that cutting taxes  was inconsistent with the
goal of balancing the budget. They  claimed, for instance, that Washington &quot;could
not afford&quot; to reduce  taxes 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 32 -->  while so much spending was being
cut to balance the  budget. These criticisms ignore the economic benefits that
would be  realized from combining tax cuts with a balanced budget.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To demonstrate this point, economists at The Heritage  Foundation used one
of the principal econometric models of the U.S.  economy to project the economic
effects of the tax cut elements of the  Balanced Budget Act. This analysis
showed that:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     The Balanced Budget Act with tax

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     The reduction in taxes on capital (including
capital gains tax  relief) accounts for $86.3 billion of this additional GDP and
leads  to a stronger economy in the long run. <TT><B><A

<P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     Many individual industries would benefit. For
example, a  balanced budget with tax cuts would result in the production of an

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>While balancing the budget is good for long-term  economic growth, even more
growth is generated by the tax cuts in the  Balanced Budget Act. The tax cuts on
family income  primarily  the $500-per-child tax credit  would allow more
households to  save or spend their hard-earned money instead of sending it to 
Wash
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 33 -->  ington, and this increased
private savings and spending would  help offset reductions in government
spending. In the long run,  increased private-sector activity with less
government  spending means a more efficient economy, more well-paying jobs, and 
a lower rate of inflation.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>During the early years of any reduction in government  spending, the economy
must adjust to a lower level of government  intervention. Businesses that
previously produced goods and services  for the government now must produce for
the private sector,  and workers previously employed by the government must find
 new jobs in the private sector. Analogously, there must be a  transition in
savings and investment. Money that would have been  invested in United States
bonds must be re-directed toward  private-sector securities, bonds, or other
vehicles. The transition from  government spending to private savings and
spending is necessary  and valuable, but it also takes time. In the short term,
returning  money to the private sector by means of the $500-per-child tax credit
 will help to offset these negative effects.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The tax cuts on capital income  especially the capital gains  tax reductions
 are necessary to ensure a stronger economy.  There are two reasons for this:
First, reducing the tax on capital  gains lowers the cost of moving an
investment from an average  company to one that is exceptionally productive and
well-run. This  lowering of the &quot;switching&quot; costs means that investors
will play a larger  role in promoting well-run, productive companies. Thus, the 
economy as a whole is likely to be more efficient. Second, lower taxes  on
capital cause the cost of capital to fall. Lenders, for example,  do not need to
charge quite as much interest on capital loans to  recoup the taxes they paid
when making the capital available to a  bor
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 34 -->  rower. Lower capital costs
usually mean more investment by  businesses in labor-saving equipment, which
commonly results in  increased labor productivity. This increased productivity 
translates into higher wages and, through the division of labor, more jobs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Individual Benefits of the Tax Cuts</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As the 1995-1996 budget debate wore on, the &quot;green  eyeshade&quot;
negotiations over how to balance the budget overshadowed  the benefits of tax
cuts to families and individual taxpayers.  President Clinton often charged that
the $245 billion tax cut package  was &quot;extreme,&quot; given how much
spending had to be reduced in order  to balance the budget. But the plan
actually is relatively modest:  It amounts to returning just 2 cents of every
dollar of the $11.5  trillion the federal government expects to collect in tax
revenues  over the next seven years. At the same time, the Washington elite 
often dismissed the $500-per-child tax cut as insignificant. For  most
hard-working American families, however, $500 is not only a  significant amount
of money, but could mean the difference  between paying and not paying the
mortgage.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For instance, the $500-per-child tax credit would eliminate  100 percent of
the income tax liability for families of four earning  up to $24,000 a year and
more than 50 percent of the income tax  liability for a family of four earning
$30,000 a year.  Moreover, while $500 may buy only a hammer in Washington, it
would  buy much more for the average family with two children. For  example, the
$500-per-child tax credit would cover any of the  following expenses for an
average family with two children:

allowing families and retirees to keep and  spend their own money. It is the

enactment of a flat tax.

<P>Americans are suffering from an income tax system that  punishes hard work,
penalizes thrift, and retards investment. To make  matters worse, the payroll

it equally certain  that they will be worse off tomorrow. Both systems need to

<P><B>Elements of a Flat Tax</B>

<P>

<P>Each of the income tax code's many shortcomings can be  addressed by

existing system with a flat tax. Whether the goal  is to address the major flaws
outlined earlier in this chapter or to  fix

specific problems, the flat  tax does the job. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There have been many flat tax proposals over the years, but  they all share
certain key features. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>One low tax rate -</B> All flat tax proposals have a single
tax rate  that applies to all income subject to tax. The actual rate imposed 
varies, but the upper limit would be about 20 percent. The  Armey/Shelby flat
tax legislation, for instance, begins with a 20 percent  rate which phases down
to 17 percent after a couple of years.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Elimination of deductions, credits, and exemptions -</B>
All pure  flat tax proposals eliminate provisions of the tax code that bestow 
preferential tax treatment on certain behaviors and activities.  Included in
this would be special tax breaks for businesses and  corporations and, for
individual taxpayers, the home mortgage interest  deduction, the charitable
contributions deduction, and the state and  local income and property tax
deductions. The combination of no  preferences, one low rate, and a generous
family allowance would  allow taxpayers to file their tax returns on a
postcard-size form.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>One-time taxation of income  -</B> Flat tax proposals are designed  to
eliminate the tax code's bias against capital formation by  ending the double
(and sometimes triple and quadruple) taxation of  income generated through
savings and investment. This is  achieved by ensuring that all income,
regardless of how it is earned or  how it is spent, is treated equally. Several
important tax policy  decisions flow from this principle, including repeal of
the estate  and gift tax, elimination of the double taxation of capital gains 
and dividend income, and neutral treatment of savings, either  through

have an immediate and dramatic impact.  Included among the many benefits are:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Faster economic growth -</B> A flat tax would spur
increased  work, saving, and investment. According to many economists, the rise 
in productive behavior would likely add one percentage point to  the annual rate
of economic growth. How significant is this?  An  increase in the growth rate of
just one-half of one percentage  point would boost an average family of four's
yearly income by  more than $5,000 after ten years.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Instant wealth creation -</B> The value of financial assets is 
determined by the after-tax income they generate over time. By  eliminating the
second, third, and fourth layers of taxation on  capital income, a flat tax
therefore would significantly boost the value  of all income-producing assets.
According to Professor  Dale Jorgenson of the Harvard Economics Department,
enactment of  a flat tax would boost wealth immediately by some $1 trillion.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Simplicity -</B> 600-plus tax forms would be swept into the trash  and
replaced by two simple postcard-size forms. Wage, salary,  and pension income
would be reported on the individual form,  and business and capital income would
be reported on the  business form. Neither form would require more than a few
minutes  to compile, substantially reducing the 5.4 billion hour yearly  burden
of today's tax code.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 40 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Fairness -</B> All taxpayers and all income would be treated  equally. A
taxpayer with ten times the taxable income of his  neighbor would pay ten times
as much in taxes. Successful entrepreneurs  no longer would be penalized by
discriminatory tax rates, and  no longer would the politically well-connected by
able to benefit  from special loopholes and preferences.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>An end to micromanagement and political favoritism -</B> All 
deductions, credits, exemptions, loopholes, and preferences would  be
eliminated. Politicians would lose their ability to pick winners  and losers,
reward friends and punish enemies, and use the tax code  to impose their values
on the economy. Investment decisions  would be guided by economic forces rather
than tax considerations.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Increased civil liberties -</B> The complexity of the tax code makes  it
nearly impossible for taxpayers or IRS agents to follow the law.  A greatly
simplified tax code would eliminate virtually all of  the conflicts and
controversies that make the IRS one of the  most feared agencies of the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Help for families -</B> The flat tax does have one exemption: All 
taxpayers, based on family size, are allowed to protect a base  amount of income
from taxation. In the Armey/Shelby legislation, a  family of four would not pay
taxes on income of less than $33,300. As  the attached <a href="tax_13.gif">chart</a> illustrates, this
large &quot;tax-free&quot; amount results  in either zero or very low tax rates
for lower - and  middle-income taxpayers.

to buy cars and fewer funds available to families looking  to buy their first

unfounded. Indeed, if the itemized  deduction is so critical, why did the
housing market do so well in  the 1980s when lower tax rates increased the
after-tax cost of  home mortgage interest payments by as much as 135 percent? 
As  the above <a href="tax_14.gif">chart</a> illustrates, there appears to be no correlation  whatsoever
between the value of the itemized reduction and either  home sales or home
values. Instead, the key to strong real estate  markets is a growing economy.
This is why realtors, homebuilders,  and homeowners will benefit from a flat
tax.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Would charities be harmed if the charitable contributions  deduction
was eliminated?</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> As is the case with housing, the evidence from the  1980s clearly
shows that charities have nothing to fear from a flat  tax. The graphs
demonstrate that charitable contributions more  than doubled during the 1980s
even though the tax benefit of giving  fell sharply. Likewise, the numbers show
that charitable giving  rises with income; thus, since a flat tax will boost
income, charities  will benefit.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Are there any groups that would pay more under a flat tax?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The flat tax is not a free lunch. Aggressive users of tax 
shelters could face higher tax bills. Wealthy wage earners who create  business
losses to cancel out their tax liabilities will lose that  gimmick under a flat
tax. Many businesses could see their tax bills go up  as well. Needless to say,
the political prospects for a flat tax  increase to the extent that the number
of &quot;losers&quot; is minimized. This is  a strong argument for maximizing
the size of the tax cut that  accompanies tax reform.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why do some opponents say dividends and interest would  not be taxed
with a flat tax?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Probably because they do not understand how the  proposal works.
Under the flat tax, capital income is taxed at the  business level. What changes
is that corporate profits are no longer  subject to a second layer of tax at the
individual level. In a flat tax  system, a dividend check becomes analogous to a
worker's paycheck   an amount of money left after taxes already have been paid. 
Similarly, interest income is taxed by making it non-deductible to  the
borrower. A company with $1 million in interest payments,  for instance, would
pay $170,000 in taxes on that amount. To tax  this income a second time by
including it in the taxable income of  the recipient would be double taxation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What happens to the capital gains tax?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Like all other provisions which double or triple tax income,  the
capital gains tax disappears. Individual taxpayers who buy  assets have paid
taxes on that income already. Whether that asset goes  up or down in value after
the purchase does not matter, since the  tax already has been paid. Businesses,
because they are able to  deduct the cost of purchasing assets, would pay tax on
asset sales.  This taxes the capital gain (if any exists), but avoids double
taxation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Will the estate tax disappear with a flat tax?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Estate and gift taxes are one of the clearest examples of  double
and triple taxation in the current tax code and will be  eliminated under the
flat tax. In addition to protecting the taxpayer from  hav
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 45 -->  ing to pay additional taxes on
income that already has been  taxed, abolishing the estate tax prevents family
businesses and  farms from being sold off for tax purposes. Another argument for
 elimination is that the estate tax drains private capital from the  economy
that is needed to finance future economic growth.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What happens to the IRS?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No tax reform proposal will eliminate the IRS. As long as  the
government intends to claim $1.4 trillion of tax revenue,  some level of tax
collection authority will be required. By radically  simplifying the tax code
and eliminating the provisions that cause  the most conflict (alternative
minimum tax, depreciation,  capital gains, itemized deductions, etc.), the flat
tax will significantly  reduce IRS abuses. For individual taxpayers, the only
things the  IRS will be able to question are total income and number of
children.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Will a flat tax encourage job creation?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> A flat tax will encourage more jobs and higher wages by  boosting
incentives to work, save, and invest. In the long run, the  elimination of most
of the tax code's bias against savings and  investment will have the biggest
effect. As studies show, a flat tax  will encourage capital formation, leading
over time to higher levels  of productivity, increased wages, and more jobs. A
flat tax also  will have a more immediate impact on job creation, however, by 
making work more attractive. High tax rates drive a wedge  between what it costs
a business to employ a worker and how much  the worker receives in take-home
pay. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt2.htm#15">15</A></B></TT>  By
increasing the cost  of labor, taxes lower the number of workers a company is
willing  to hire. Businesses do not exist to pay workers more than they  are 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 46 -->  worth. They exist to make money
and will hire only as long as  the value of each new worker's additional output
exceeds the total  cost of employing that worker.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>When politicians enact policies that raise the cost of  employment, the
total cost of some workers will rise above the value they  bring their
employers. In the long run, a business has only two  options when faced with
this predicament: close its doors or lay off  workers who are net money losers.
Even workers who retain their  jobs pay a price. Taxes on labor income, whether
paid by employee  or employer, dollar for dollar, unavoidably reduce the amount 
that finds its way into their paychecks. Politicians may pretend  otherwise, but
every time the tax burden climbs, workers' after-tax  income declines. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt2.htm#16">16</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Would a flat tax reduce the budget deficit?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> This depends on which flat tax is implemented. More 
specifically, it depends on the tax rate and whether the proposal  includes
limits on government spending. Even though lower rates  generally stimulate
economic growth and expand the tax base, at some  point they translate into less
revenue. A flat tax of 20 percent, for  instance, almost certainly would raise
more money than a flat tax  of 10 percent. The size of the personal
exemption/family  allowance also plays a key role, since the decision to protect
a certain  amount of income ($36,800 for a family of four in last year's Armey 
bill) generally means the rate on taxable income must be higher.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>According to a Treasury Department analysis leaked to the  media before the
1994 elections, the Administration estimates that  the Armey flat tax would
result in a $244 billion revenue loss to  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 47 -->  federal government in 1995. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt2.htm#17">17</A></B></TT>  But this study contained
a  $500 billion error, as the Department later  admitted, <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt2.htm#18">18</A></B></TT> and used the 17 percent
rate to analyze 1995 revenues even though the Armey  bill calls explicitly for
an initial rate of 20 percent (which would  be phased down to 17 percent). The
Treasury Department now  claims that, once fully phased in, the Armey flat tax
would &quot;cost&quot;  the government as much as $186 billion per year. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt2.htm#19">19</A></B></TT> Because it  is based on
static analysis, however, this figure assumes that  reduced tax rates and
simplification would have no positive effect on  the economy. Hence, it ignores
the additional revenues produced  by income growth (as well as the binding caps
on federal  spending that the Armey bill would impose). <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt2.htm#20">20</A>
</B></TT></P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>A flat tax almost certainly would reduce long-term  government borrowing
since its reduced rates and lower taxes on savings  and investment would boost
economic growth. Each year, the  result would be an expanding tax base and at
least some reduction  in outlays for certain means-tested programs and the 
unemployment compensation system. According to one relatively modest  estimate
of supply-side impact, a flat tax would increase the  economy's long-run annual
growth rate by just 0.5 percent. By the tenth  year, national economic output
would be $578 billion higher than  it would have been without a flat tax. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt2.htm#21">21</A>
</B></TT> Government's &quot;share&quot;  of this production of additional goods
and services would be $86  billion in tax revenue. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt2.htm#22">22</A></B></TT>  By the twentieth year,
added growth of  0.5 percent would mean an increase of more than $2 trillion in 
GDP and additional tax revenues in excess of $300 billion.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The revenue feedback from higher growth, however,  probably would not be
enough in the short term to offset the revenue  lost from lower tax rates and
elimination of the multiple taxation  of 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 48 -->  capital income. Achieving a
deficit-neutral flat tax (at least  the Armey version) would require some
restraints on  government spending. And if lawmakers were forced to balance the
budget  by 2002, the limit on spending increases would have to be even  more
stringent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What would happen to the price of other assets?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> While the potentially negative impact on housing markets  and
charity appears negligible, the positive impact on  income-producing assets
would be large. Assets such as stocks, bonds, and  rental properties produce a
stream of income over time. Their  market price is determined by calculating how
much income an asset  will produce over time, after taxes, adjusted to reflect
the fact that  income today is worth more than the same amount of nominal 
income in the future. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt2.htm#23">23</A></B></TT>
 By lowering tax rates and removing  the double and sometimes triple taxation of
capital income, a flat  tax can increase dramatically the after-tax income
stream an asset  will generate. Thus, a low-rate flat tax would be a boon to
asset  holders, offsetting any theoretical fall in housing prices, and  would
stimulate a surge of new investment in the economy. Harvard  professor and tax
economist Dale Jorgenson estimates that a flat  tax would increase national
wealth by $1  trillion. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt2.htm#24">24</A></B></TT>
 While this may seem high, it should be remembered that the mere  announcement
in Israel that a capital gains tax was being imposed caused the  Israeli stock
market to drop by 10 percent in just one  day.<TT><B>
<A HREF="ftnt2.htm#25">25</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Would a flat tax benefit everybody?
</B></P>
<P>
</P> 
<P><B>A.</B> If the question is considered narrowly (will anyone's tax  bill
rise?) it depends on how a flat tax is structured. If it is designed  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 49 -->  give the government as much money
as it receives under the  current system, and if there is no consideration of
the increased  revenue that would accrue from new job creation and higher 
economic growth, then it is impossible to avoid having winners  and losers. In
the long run, a flat tax presumably would generate  higher incomes and living
standards, raising after-tax income even  for those who suffered a short-term
tax increase. At the same time,  it doubtless would have an adverse impact on
the lawyers,  accountants, and lobbyists who profit from the current law's
complexity.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Many flat tax proposals are structured so that few taxpayers,  if any, would
have higher tax bills. This is because they are  designed to go beyond
simplification and rate reduction to include  significant tax cuts for the
American economy. The Armey plan is  a good example. Using static estimating
techniques, it  probably would save taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars
over a  five-year period. While the combination of a 17 percent tax rate  and
generous family exemption would not necessarily guarantee  lower tax bills for
everyone, few would face higher taxes.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Is there a way to stop politicians from raising tax rates in  the
future?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> There is no guarantee that a future Congress would not turn  a
simple flat tax back into a complicated &quot;progressive&quot; tax. This  is
the Achilles' Heel of tax reform. The sweeping reform enacted  in 1986 expanded
the tax base by eliminating many deductions  while simultaneously reducing tax
rates to keep the total tax burden  from climbing. Skeptics warned that
politicians could not be trusted  to honor this arrangement and that eventually
they would raise  rates while failing to restore deductions. This is exactly
what  happened 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 50 -->  under Presidents Bush and
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Could this happen with a flat tax?  Using the promise of low  tax rates,
could politicians take away the home mortgage interest  deduction, the
charitable contributions deduction, and other tax  preferences but then raise
tax rates in the future?  It is to reduce  this danger that most proponents of a
flat tax include an ironclad  provision to make raising tax rates difficult or
impossible. One way  to accomplish this would be by amending the Constitution to
 require that no increase in tax rates can be approved without the votes  of at
least three-fifths or two-thirds (in other words, a  &quot;super-majority&quot;)
of both the House and  Senate. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt2.htm#26">26</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Should the income tax be abolished instead?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Proponents of a flat tax note that the current &quot;progressive&quot;
 income tax penalizes growth, discourages savings and  investment, imposes heavy
compliance costs, destroys jobs, and  reduces America's international
competitiveness. It has been pointed  out, moreover, that a flat rate income tax
reduces but does not  eliminate these negative effects. Thus, the question for
some  becomes whether it would be better to replace the income tax with a sales 
or &quot;consumption&quot; tax. Proponents of this view, including  House Ways
and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer (R-TX)  and Senator Richard Lugar
(R-IN), usually suggest that the  foregone revenue could be offset by spending
cuts, consumption taxes,  or some combination of the two.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Most advocates of a flat tax recognize that this argument is  sound, at
least in theory. Abolishing the income tax, closing down  the Internal Revenue
Service, and repealing the 16th  Amendment 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 51 -->  clearly would be in the national
interest. Eliminating the  income tax would lead to even more economic growth
and job  creation than would occur under a flat tax. The real question is how 
that goal can be achieved.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>Supporters of the flat tax have decided that eliminating the  income tax is
unlikely, especially in the short run. Because so many  interest groups benefit
from the current tax system, enacting a flat  tax will be difficult by itself.
Moreover, there is some concern  that proposals to abolish the income tax could
play into the hands  of those who want a national sales tax, or value added tax
(VAT),  as an add-on tax. If implemented as a replacement for the income  tax,
either of these would be less destructive to the economy. The  experiences of
other countries, however, suggest that, while a  VAT would be implemented with
the promise to eliminate other  taxes, politicians would never take that second
step. The country  then would have the worst of both worlds: income and direct 
consumption taxes. <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt2.htm#27">27</A> 
</B></TT>In any event, enacting a flat tax is probably  necessary as an interim
measure for those who favor eliminating the  income tax.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Would a flat tax eliminate the marriage penalty?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Probably, but it depends on how the flat tax is structured.  The
marriage penalty refers to the increased tax faced by a  married couple compared
to two single people with similar incomes.  This penalty is most severe for
couples with similar earnings. A flat  tax automatically solves part of this
problem by making it no  longer possible for one spouse's income to push a
couple into a higher  tax bracket. But the marriage penalty also arises if the
personal  exemption for a married couple is not twice the size of the  exemption

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 52 -->  for those filing singly. The
Armey proposal solves this part of  the problem by giving a married couple twice
the exemption of  a single filer. Nevertheless, a flat tax could be constructed
that  retains this penalty.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. How would a flat tax affect business and payroll taxes?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> It would be possible to reform the personal income tax 
dramatically while leaving the corporate income tax untouched. As  mentioned
earlier, many businesses file using the personal tax code,  so many of their
problems would be solved by a flat tax that left  the corporate tax code
untouched. All flat taxes based on the  Hall/Rabushka model, however, reform
both the personal and  corporate income tax codes. Under the Armey proposal, for
instance,  the business rate would fall to 17 percent, the same as the  personal
rate, and the code would be reformed to eliminate the excess  taxation of
capital.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A flat tax can be designed to include substantial reform of  Social Security
and Medicare payroll taxes. Under current law,  payroll taxes totaling 15.3
percent are levied on the first $61,600 of  income (7.65 percent each from
employer and employee,  though economists agree that the entire tax is borne by
the  worker). <TT><B><A HREF="ftnt2.htm#28">28</A></B></TT>
 Although none has reached legislative form, some flat tax plans  incorporate
the payroll tax, making the total marginal tax rate a  fixed percentage
regardless of income.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Would a flat tax help America compete?
</B></P>
<P>
</P> 
<P><B>A.</B> The historic tax rate reductions launched by Ronald Reagan  in
the 1980s caused a chain reaction around the world. Many  nations 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 53 -->  followed America's example and
have made similarly  dramatic reductions in marginal tax rates in recent years.
In large part,  this worldwide shift in tax policy was driven by competition as 
investors avoided nations with high tax rates. Unfortunately,  America seems to
be one of the few nations that have not learned from  the experience of the
1980s. While the rest of the world has been  cutting taxes, the United States
stands alone as the only major  nation to impose sharply higher tax rates in
recent years. Investors  have reacted accordingly, and the amount of new
investment in  American jobs and business from overseas has dropped from an 
average of $175 billion per year during the low tax years of the 1980s to  an
average of only $108 billion in 1990. <TT><B><A
HREF="ftnt2.htm#29">29</A></B></TT>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What happens to capital gains taxes and estate taxes under a  flat
tax?</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> They are all eliminated. One of the key principles of a flat tax 
is that income is taxed only once. A capital gain for a financial  asset is
simply a reflection that the market's expectation of the  after-tax streams of
income from that asset has risen. Under a flat tax,  that income is taxed at the
business level when it is realized. To tax  the capital gain is double taxation.
Similarly, the estate tax is a  second layer of tax on earning which, under the
current system,  already has been taxed at least once.

Under the leadership of President Ronald Reagan, the 1980s were "the most prosperous decade in American history. That means the vast majority of Americans lived at a higher standard of living than they, or anyone else, ever had before, anywhere on the globe."<sup>1</sup>  Yet critics in the media and elsewhere persist in spreading such myths as the notion that the 1980s were a "decade of greed" in which the rich got richer and the poor got poorer.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Imagine what they would have said if the economic policy of the Reagan Administration had been a failure.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ronald Reagan did more than engineer sweeping economic policy changes that produced the longest peacetime economic boom in American history. He inherited an economic crisis of disastrous proportions that had been developing for over a decade and, in just a few years, reversed it to produce an economic triumph:<blockquote>

	Lest we forget, in 1979 the world stood on an economic precipice. Inflation ran 13.5 percent in 1980, real production dipped and the prime rate reached 21.5 percent. And economics as conventionally understood provided no intellectual tools for understanding this crisis, let alone curbing it. Worse, the affliction had struck the whole world, and threatened more damage to come.<sup>2</sup></blockquote><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the late 1970s, few believed the persistent inflation that had been building for more than ten years could be stopped, or at least stopped without creating another depression. Interest rates were at a crisis level, unemployment was rising, real incomes were falling, poverty was rising, productivity was stagnant, real economic growth had ceased, and both the dollar and the stock market were on the verge of collapse.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Reagan reversed each and every one of these trends. How did he do it?  The Reagan economic policy consisted of four basic components:
<ul>
<p><li>Deep across-the-board tax cuts.

<p><li>Across-the-board domestic spending cuts.

<p><li>Deregulation.

<p><li>Sound monetary policies to restrain inflation.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Reagan implemented these policies quickly, and the results were the largest peacetime economic boom in American history and nearly 20 million new jobs. To listen to many in the press today, however, it was a time of misery. The liberal establishment could not abide Reagan's policies of allowing people to keep more of their own money through real tax cuts and generally shifting power from the government to the people, so they have set out to tell us why the boom was a bust and the greatest of successes the greatest of failures.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This is hardly surprising. Liberals must attack Reagan's success if they are to build popular support for higher taxes, more regulation, and higher government spending. But their attack can be countered. The following pages provide the evidence, point by point, with which conservative candidates can refute this attempt to rewrite history.
<p>

<b>What Happened to Federal Revenues?</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

There has been a great deal of rhetoric about Reagan tax cuts draining the federal Treasury. The reality is that revenues increased significantly.
<ul>
<p><li>Total federal revenues doubled, rising from $517.1 billion in 1980 to $1,031.3 billion, or just over $1 trillion, in 1990. In constant inflation-adjusted dollars, this was an increase of 26 percent.

<p><li>As a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), federal revenues declined only slightly, from 19.6 percent in 1980 to 18.8 percent in 1990 (see <a href="1980st1.gif">Table 1</a>).

<p><li>Revenues from individual income taxes climbed from $244.1 billion in 1980 to $466.9 billion in 1990 (see <a href="1980st1.gif">Table 1</a>). In inflation-adjusted dollars, this amounted to an increase of about 25 percent.
</ul>

<p>
<b>What Happened to Federal Spending?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Much also is made of the Reagan budget cuts, but the truth is that federal spending also rose significantly during the 1980s.
<ul>
<p><li>Federal spending more than doubled, growing from $590.9 billion in 1980 to $1,252.7 billion, or $1.25 trillion, in 1990 (see <a href="1980st2.gif">Table 2</a>). In constant inflation-adjusted dollars, this was an increase of 33.4 percent.

<p><li>As a percentage of GDP, federal expenditures grew slightly, climbing from 22.3 percent in 1980 to 22.9 percent in 1990 (see <a href="1980st2.gif">Table 2</a>).
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

As discussed in detail in Chapter 7, government spending to aid the poor also climbed steeply throughout the 1980s and is now at record levels by every measure. The same is true of education, discussed in detail in Chapter 9.

<p>
<b>What Happened to Federal Deficits?</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

With federal revenues doubling in the 1980s, the cause of the deficit during that period is clear: runaway federal spending, which more than doubled (see <a href="1980st2.gif">Table 2</a>). Federal taxes in 1990 amounted to about 19 percent of GDP, which is approximately where they had been for 40 years, since the early 1950s. Federal spending in 1990 was about 23 percent of GDP, having fluctuated around 19 percent to 20 percent of GDP during most of the postwar era until the late 1970s. During the 1980s, taxes were maintained at historic levels as spending surpassed well-established historic levels, creating the deficit.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In Reagan's last budget year, however, the federal deficit actually had been <i>reduced</i> to $152.5 billion (see <a href="1980st3.gif">Table 3</a>). As a percentage of GDP, this was about the same as the deficit for 1980.<ul>

<p><li>The deficit in fiscal 1989 was 2.9 percent of GDP, compared to 2.8 percent in 1980. Reagan had cut the deficit as a percentage of GDP by more than half from 1983, when it was 6.3 percent.

<p><li>This was accomplished by reducing federal spending from over 24 percent of GDP to about 22 percent of GDP. The problem is that federal spending started to escalate again after Reagan left office. By 1992, the deficit had leaped to a record $290.4 billion, about one-third higher than its highest level under Reagan.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Total federal debt held by the public was 44 percent of GDP in 1990 (see <a href="1980st5.gif">Table 5</a>). This was the same level as in 1940 during the liberal-supported New Deal. It was also less than publicly held federal debt as a percentage of GDP during the Kennedy Administration in the early 1960s. Publicly held debt totaled 113.8 percent of GDP in 1946, as a result of World War II, and remained higher than the peak achieved during the Reagan years until 1964; but it did not prevent an American economic boom during the postwar period.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Critics have argued that the 1980s deficits were financed by a massive influx of foreign investment which bought up federal debt and left America vulnerable to economic calamity if foreign investors decided to withdraw. In fact, foreign interests held 16.7 percent of public federal debt at the end of fiscal 1990, compared to 17.5 percent at the end of fiscal 1980.<sup>3</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another perspective is gained by comparing U.S. budget deficits in the 1980s with the average budget deficits in the same years for the seven leading industrial countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Calculating deficits as a percentage of GDP for all levels of government within each country, the OECD reports that the total U.S. government deficit (federal, state, and local) was close to the average deficit as a percentage of GDP for all of the G-7 countries throughout the Reagan years (see <a href="1980st6.gif">Table 6</a>).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Finally, interest rates fell sharply and consistently throughout the Reagan years despite deficits, as shown below. The academic literature shows no correlation between federal budget deficits and interest rates.<sup>4</sup>  By 1992, when the federal deficit hit a record $290.4 billion, interest rates were at their lowest levels since before 1980 (see <a href="1980st10.gif">Table 10</a>).
<p>

<b>What Happened to Inflation?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Many Americans seem to have forgotten that inflation threatened the very foundations of the economy in 1980. Inflation soared during the late 1970s, reaching 11.3 percent in 1979 and 13.5 percent in 1980 -- a 25 percent rise in prices in just two years (see <a href="1980st7.gif">Table 7</a>). Many experts doubted that this problem, which had been gathering steam since the mid-1960s, could be cured without causing a deep recession or even a depression. Others doubted that it could be cured at all.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Conservatives argued that this inflation was caused by loose, "easy money" Federal Reserve policies which allowed the money supply to grow too rapidly. Thus, a central plank of the Reagan economic platform was a restrained monetary policy that would hold growth in the money supply to the level necessary to maintain real economic growth. Reagan pursued this policy vigorously and faithfully. The result: inflation was reduced by more than half, to 6.2 percent, by 1982 (see <a href="1980st7.gif">Table 7</a>), dropping to 3.2 percent in 1983 and remaining near that level for the rest of Reagan's term.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To this day, the inflation problem that seemed so threatening and unsolvable 15 years ago has not returned, but this overwhelmingly important achievement somehow has been all but forgotten in the debate over Reagan's economic policies and the 1980s.
<p>

<b>What Happened to Economic Growth?</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

By 1983, despite a steep recession in 1982 caused by the tight money policies needed to squeeze out the historic inflation level of the late 1970s, the Reagan policies of reduced taxes, spending, regulation, and inflation were in place. The result was an economic boom.
<ul>
<p><li>This boom lasted 92 months without a recession, from November 1982 to July 1990, the longest period of sustained peacetime growth in U.S. history and the second-longest period of sustained growth, including even wartime. It was also more than twice the average period of expansions since World War II.<sup>5</sup><p><li>The American economy grew by about one-third in real inflation-adjusted terms. This was the equivalent of adding the entire economy of Germany, East and West, or two-thirds of the economy of Japan, to the U.S. economy.<sup>6</sup><p><li>From 1950 to 1973, real economic growth in the U.S. economy averaged 3.6 percent per year. From 1973 to 1982, it averaged only 1.6 percent. The Reagan economic boom restored the more usual growth rate as the economy averaged 3.5 percent in real growth from the beginning of 1983 to the end of 1990.<sup>7</sup></ul><p><b>What Happened to Jobs?</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A central feature of the 1980s was a boom in jobs and employment. The figures are impressive.<ul><p><li>From 1980 to 1990, 18.6 million new jobs were created, increasing U.S. civilian employment by almost 20 percent. Almost 23 percent -- about 4.2 million -- of these jobs went to black workers.<sup>8</sup>

<p><li>By 1989, unemployment for the year had fallen to 5.3 percent, the lowest since 1973 and down from 7.1 percent in 1980 (see <a href="1980st8.gif">Table 8</a>).

<p><li>In 1989, labor force participation reached a record 66.5 percent, and a record 63 percent of the population was employed. Black labor force participation also hit a record 64.2 percent in 1989, with female labor force participation reaching an all-time record of 57.5 percent in 1990.<sup>9</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In addition, contrary to the myth makers' claims, most jobs created during the 1980s were good jobs.
<ul>
<p><li>About 82 percent were in the higher-paying, higher-skilled (technical, precision production, managerial and professional) occupations. Only 12 percent were in the lowest-paid, low-skilled service occupations, such as retailing and fast-food restaurants.<sup>10</sup><p><li>Data collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that during Ronald Reagan's first term, 48.7 percent of new jobs were in the best-paid managerial and professional category.<sup>11</sup>  This trend continued into his second term.</ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This represented a dramatic turnaround from the Carter years, when most new jobs were low-paid (defined as under $7,000 per year) and the number of high-paid jobs (more than $28,000 per year) actually declined.<ul><p><li>From 1977 to 1980, 41.77 percent of the new jobs paid under $7,000 per year in real 1984 dollars, while the number of jobs paying over $28,000 per year declined by 10 percent (see <a href="1980st9.gif">Table 9</a>).

<p><li>During Reagan's first term, only 6 percent of the new jobs paid under $7,000 and 46.7 percent paid more than $28,000 per year, both in constant 1984 dollars (see <a href="1980st9.gif">Table 9</a>). This was also a dramatic improvement over the 1973-1977 Nixon/Ford term, when 37.6 percent of the new jobs were in the low-paid category and only 11.2 percent were in the high-paid category (see Table 9).
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Critics often claim the period from 1979 to 1984 produced more lower-paying jobs, but this is misleading because it includes two terrible Carter years, 1979 and 1980. In the words of <i>The Washington Post</i> and <i>Newsweek</i> columnist Robert Samuelson, "Welcome to Economics Propaganda 101. The notion that the U.S. economy is producing mostly low-paying, unskilled jobs is an economic fiction."<sup>12</sup><p><b>What Happened to Interest Rates?</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;President Clinton likes to claim that he reduced interest rates to their lowest levels in 15 years. The truth is that they have been falling steadily ever since Ronald Reagan took office in 1981 (see <a href="1980st10.gif">Table 10</a>).
<ul>
<p><li><b>The prime rate</b> declined from an average of 18.87 percent in 1981 to 6.25 percent in 1992 and was down to 6 percent in December 1992 from a peak of 21.5 percent at the end of 1980.<sup>13</sup><p><li><b>New home mortgage rates</b> declined from an average of 14.7 percent in 1982 to 8.07 percent in November 1992.<p><li><b>AAA corporate bonds</b> declined from an average of 14.17 percent in 1981 to 8.14 percent in 1992. In December 1992, the yield dropped to 7.98 percent.

<p><li><b>The yield on new three-month Treasury bills</b> declined from an average of 14.029 percent in 1981 to 3.45 percent in 1992. In December 1992, it fell to 3.25 percent.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Clearly, today's low interest rates are a product of the Reagan and Bush years, not the Clinton years.

<p>
<b>What Happened to Incomes?</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Reagan economic boom also boosted family incomes across the board.
<ul>
<p><li><b>Real median family income</b>, adjusted for inflation, began to decline during the Carter years, falling almost 10 percent from 1978 to 1982. The Reagan recovery reversed this trend. Median family incomes started to rise again in 1983 and had increased by 11.3 percent by 1989.<sup>14</sup><p><li><b>Real average income</b> of U.S. households rose by 15.2 percent from 1980 to 1989, and by 16.8 percent from 1982 to 1989, compared to a 0.8 percent decline from 1970 to 1980.<sup>15</sup><p><LI><B>Real, per capita, disposable income</b> increased by 18 percent from 1982 to 1990. In other words, American living standards increased by almost 20 percent during the Reagan economic boom.<sup>16</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Critics often cite a decline in income from 1979 to 1989 among families in the lowest 20 percent of incomes. This, too, is thoroughly misleading. Average real household income for the bottom quintile declined by 14.2 percent from 1979 to 1983. The Reagan boom reversed this trend, increasing this group's average real income by 12.2 percent from 1983 to 1989. Average real income was still lower in 1989 than in 1979, but the problem was the precipitous decline in such incomes during the Carter years. Reagan engineered a major recovery in the lowest group's incomes (see <a href="1980st9.gif">Table 9</a>).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Real household incomes also rose for every other 20 percent of income distribution during the Reagan recovery from 1983 to 1989:
<ul>
<p><li>For the second-lowest quintile, by 10.1 percent.

<p><li>For the middle quintile, by 10.7 percent.

<p><LI>For the second-highest quintile, by 11.6 percent.

<p><li>For the highest quintile, by 18.8 percent.<sup>17</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Real incomes rose for every quintile from 1980 to 1989, and from 1980 to 1990 as well, but declined for every quintile during the Carter years from 1977 to 1980.<sup>18</sup>  A study by the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that real, per capita, before-tax income rose substantially for every quintile of income distribution from 1984 to 1989:
<ul>
<p><li>For the lowest quintile, by a stunning 68 percent.

<p><li>For the second-lowest quintile, by 18.7 percent.

<p><li>For the middle quintile, by 9 percent.

<p><li>For the second-highest quintile, by 12.1 percent.

<p><li>For the highest quintile, by 19.2 percent.<sup>19</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover, there is broad movement of people among quintiles in income distribution over time. This is clearly demonstrated in a Treasury study which found that 85.8 percent of those in the bottom 20 percent of income distribution in 1979 had climbed to a higher quintile by 1988, and 65 percent had moved up at least 2 quintiles.
<ul>
<p><li>Only 14.2 percent remained in the bottom 20 percent, and 14.7 percent of those who were in the bottom 20 percent in 1979 were in the top 20 percent by 1988. Thus, people in the bottom quintile in 1979 were more likely to be in the top quintile than in the bottom quintile by 1988.

<p><li>60 percent of those in the second-lowest 20 percent in 1979 had moved into a higher quintile by 1988.

<p><li>Of those in the middle 20 percent in 1979, 47 percent had moved up to a higher-income quintile by 1988 while fewer than 20 percent had moved down to a lower quintile.

<p><li>By contrast, a third of those in the top 20 percent in 1979 had fallen to a lower-income quintile by 1988, and over half (52.7 percent) of those in the top 1 percent in 1979 had fallen to a lower-income category by 1988.<sup>20</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The results of another study by Isabel Sawhill and Mark Condon of the liberal Urban Institute are similarly instructive.<ul><p><li>The average family income of those who were in the lowest quintile of income distribution in 1977 had increased 77 percent in real inflation-adjusted terms by 1986 when many had moved to higher quintiles.<p><li>The average for those in the second-lowest quintile in 1977 had increased 37 percent in real terms by 1986.

<p><li>The average for those in the middle quintile in 1977 had increased 20 percent in real terms by 1986.

<p><li>The average for those in the second-highest quintile in 1977 had increased only 10 percent in real terms by 1986.

<p><li>The average for those in the top quintile in 1977 had increased only 5 percent in real terms by 1986.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

According to Sawhill and Condon, "when one follows individuals instead of statistical groups defined by income, one finds that, on average, the rich got a little richer and the poor got much richer."  The reason:
<blockquote>
	People who start at the bottom have nowhere to move but up, and are likely to do so as they become older, gain more seniority, and earn higher incomes. People who start at the top, some of whom may be there because of temporary sources of income like capital gains, have nowhere to go but down. This pattern, however, may be surprising to the general public, which has been led to believe that the poor were literally getting poorer over the past decade or two, and that the incomes of the rich were skyrocketing. This is simply not true.<sup>21</sup></blockquote>A widely cited study by the Democrat-controlled Congressional Budget Office erroneously contended that the top 1 percent of income earners received 60 percent of the income gains in the 1980s, but this study was filled with faulty calculations.<ul><p><li>Capital gains income was not adjusted for inflation.<p><li>Most capital losses and partnership losses were not counted.

<p><li>Appreciation of pension fund assets and homes was not counted, understating the gains of the middle and working classes.

<p><li>Incomes of the bottom 60 percent of earners were substantially undercounted, compared to incomes for those groups reported by the Census Bureau.

<p><li>Families were assigned to income quintiles with an adjustment for family size, but incomes in the study were not adjusted for family size.

<p><li>Most shocking of all, using this same flawed methodology, the real era of greed would have been the Carter years of 1977-1980 when, calculating income distribution in the same way, 100 percent of the income gains went to the top 1 percent.<sup>22</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In his careful book <i>What Went Right in the 1980s</i>, on the other hand, University of California Professor Richard McKenzie presents the actual distribution of income gains based on data collected and reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. He shows the percentages of the increase in real, before-tax, per capita income actually earned by each quintile from 1984 to 1989:
<ul>
<p><li>For the lowest quintile, 15.4 percent.

<p><li>For the second-lowest quintile, 11.9 percent.

<p><li>For the middle quintile, 9.0 percent.

<p><li>For the second-highest quintile, 16.7 percent.

<p><li>For the highest quintile, 46.9 percent.<sup>23</sup><p></ul>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The impression conveyed by these Tables, which show that the top 20 percent earned less than 47 percent of the income gains, stands in stark contrast to the picture painted by the Congressional Budget Office, with its top 1 percent earning 60 percent of the gains.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Another widely cited article, "The Incredible Shrinking Middle Class," published in <i>American Demographics</i> for May 1992, argued that the middle class shrank in the 1980s as the number of families earning between $15,000 and $50,000 in constant 1990 dollars fell from 58 percent of all families in 1980 to under 53 percent in 1990. According to the article's own data, however, this occurred because the incomes of so many families grew above $50,000, not because middle-class incomes fell.
<ul>
<p><li>The percentage of families earning less than $15,000 in 1990 dollars fell from 17.5 in 1980 to 16.9 in 1990.

<p><li>The percentage of families earning more than $50,000 in 1990 dollars rose from 24.5 in 1980 to nearly 31 in 1990.

<p><li>During the 1970s, while the percentage of families earning $15,000 to $50,000 in constant dollars fell from 60.5 to 58, the percentage earning less than $15,000 rose from 16 to 17.5, while the percentage earning over $50,000 rose only from 23.5 to 24.5.<sup>24</sup></ul>Statistics on income growth for different percentages of the population will always show a somewhat larger income gain for the top group studied, whether it is 1, 5, 20, or some other percentage. There are two reasons for this.<ul><p><li>Income gains for the lower groups will be reduced because the fastest gainers from each group will climb to a higher group and be counted in that group's average incomes in later periods. For example, assume the income of a person in the bottom 20 percent rises from $5,000 in the first period to $20,000 in the second period. Because this puts him in the second-lowest quintile, his income will not be among those counted in the bottom quintile in the second period. Therefore, it cannot push up the bottom quintile's average for that period. On the other hand, all income gains for those in the top group will still be counted in that group's income in the second period, simply because there is no higher group into which the fastest income gainers can rise.

<p><li>Also, as incomes rise over time, the cut-off necessary to be in the top 1, 5, 20, or other percent will rise. This means the average income needed to qualify for the top group also will rise. For example, it may take $100,000 to be in the top 1 percent in the first year; in the second year, if the incomes of the next 9 percent rise rapidly during the year, it may take $110,000 to qualify for the top 1 percent. Many in the next 9 percent may climb over some in the top 1 percent to form a new top 1 percent with a higher average income.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Another device often used to distort income or other economic statistics for the 1980s is to include some of the Carter years or other bad years from the 1970s in the calculation. Periods cited may start with 1979, 1977, or even 1973. Shifting the starting point to years before 1981, when Ronald Reagan took office, lumps declining incomes or other declining economic performance from the 1970s with rising incomes or other economic performance from the Reagan years, leaving a distorted impression.

<p>
<b>What Happened to the Federal Tax Burden?</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Probably the greatest myth about the 1980s is that Ronald Reagan slashed taxes dramatically for the rich, the result being that they no longer pay their fare share. The flaw in this claim is that it mixes tax rates with taxes actually paid and ignores the real trend of taxation.
<ul>
<p><li>In 1991 (the last year for which data are available), the top 1 percent of taxpayers in income paid 25 percent of all income taxes, the top 5 percent paid 43 percent, and the bottom 50 percent paid only 5 percent (see <a href="1980st11.gif">Table 11</a>). To suggest that this distribution is unfair because it is too easy on upper-income groups is nothing less than absurd.

<p><LI>The proportion of total income taxes paid by the top 1 percent rose sharply under Reagan from 18 percent in 1981 to 28 percent in 1988 (see Table 11).

<p><li>Average effective income tax rates were cut even more for lower-income groups than for higher-income groups. While the average effective tax rate for the top 1 percent fell by 30 percent between 1980 and 1992 -- and by 35 percent for the top 20 percent  of income earners -- it was reduced by 44 percent for the second-highest quintile, 46 percent for the middle quintile, 64 percent for the second-lowest quintile, and 263 percent for the bottom quintile (see <a href="1980st12.gif">Table 12</a>).

<p><li>The reductions for the lowest-income groups were so large because Reagan doubled the personal exemption, increased the standard deduction, and tripled the earned income tax credit (EITC), which provides net cash for single-parent families with children at the lowest income levels. These changes eliminated income tax liability altogether for over 4 million lower-income families.<sup>25</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Critics often add the Social Security payroll tax and argue that the total federal tax burden shifted more to lower-income groups and away from upper-income groups, but Reagan's changes were in the income tax, not in the Social Security payroll tax. The payroll tax was imposed by liberal members of Congress over the last 50 years, and it is they, not Ronald Reagan, who should be held accountable for its distributional effects.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Even if one counts the Social Security payroll tax, the share of total federal taxes increased for the following:
<ul>
<p><li>For the top 1 percent of taxpayers, from 12.9 percent in 1980 to 15.4 percent in 1989.

<p><li>For the top 5 percent of taxpayers, from 27.3 percent in 1980 to 30.4 percent in 1989.

<p><li>For the top 20 percent of taxpayers, from 56.1 percent in 1980 to 58.6 percent in 1989.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Similarly, even if one includes the Social Security payroll tax, the share of total federal taxes declined for four groups:
<ul>
<p><li>For the second-highest 20 percent of taxpayers, from 22.2 percent in 1980 to 20.8 percent in 1989.

<p><li>For the middle 20 percent of taxpayers, from 13.2 percent in 1980 to 12.5 percent in 1989.

<p><li>For the second-lowest 20 percent of taxpayers, from 6.9 percent in 1980 to 6.4 percent in 1989.

<p><li></ul>For the lowest 20 percent of taxpayers, from 1.6 percent in 1980 to 1.5 percent in 1989.<sup>26</sup><p><b>What Happened to Poverty?</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Despite claims to the contrary, the Reagan economic recovery was effective in reducing poverty.
<ul>
<p><li>The poverty rate actually started to increase rapidly during the Carter years, rising by one-third from 1978 to 1983, when it climbed from 11.4 percent to 15.2 percent. It fell every year from 1984 to 1989, however, dropping by one-sixth from its 1983 peak to 12.8 percent in 1989.<sup>27</sup><p><li>The black poverty rate fell to 30.6 percent in 1989, the lowest on record except for 30.6 percent in 1978 and 30.3 percent in 1974.<sup>28</sup><p><li>From 1978 to 1983, the number of people in poverty increased by about 40 percent, from 24.7 million to 35.3 million. The Reagan recovery again reversed this trend, reducing the poverty population to 31.5 million -- a drop of 3.8 million -- in 1989.<sup>29</sup></ul><p><b>What Happened to the Misery Index?</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A popular indicator of the economic performance of Presidents has been the so-called misery index, defined as the total of inflation and unemployment each year. Ronald Reagan engineered the largest reduction in the misery index in history. From 1980 to 1988 (Reagan's last year in office), the index fell by over 50 percent. At 9.6, the index in 1988 was lower than in any other year since 1970, except for 1972 (see <a href="1980sc1.gif">Chart 1</a>). The Presidency of Jimmy Carter, who invented the term, still holds the record for the highest misery indices.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Harvard University economist Robert Barro has developed a different index of Presidential economic performance. His Economic Report Card for Presidents includes the change each year in inflation, unemployment, interest rates, and growth in Gross National Product (GNP) under each President.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Of all eleven Presidents since 1949, Reagan ranks both highest (first term, 1981-1985) and second-highest (second term, 1985-1989) in economic performance under Barro's index. Jimmy Carter ranks lowest, and George Bush ranks fifth (see <a href="1980st13.gif">Table 13</a>).

<p>

<b>The Boom in Charity</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The 1980s has been labeled by some as the decade of greed. The truth is that total giving to charitable causes in the United States grew at a record pace.
<ul>
<p><li>Between 1980 and 1989, charitable giving in real terms increased by 5.1 percent per year, compared to 3.3 percent per year from 1955 through 1979.<sup>30</sup><p><LI>Charitable giving per capita in real terms grew at a rate of 4 percent per year, double the rate of 2 percent per year from 1955 to 1979.<sup>31</sup><p><li>Between 1980 and 1989, charitable giving in real dollars rose by 56 percent to $121 billion.<sup>32</sup></ul><p><b>The Surge in Manufacturing</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another myth holds that during the 1980s, the U.S. economy was deindustrializing as manufacturing became uncompetitive and fell into decline. The facts tell a vastly different story.<ul><p><li>Manufacturing output rose by 38 percent in real inflation-adjusted dollars between 1980 and 1989. This left output at 23 percent of GNP in 1989, compared to 21 percent in 1980, and higher as a percentage of GNP in 1988 and 1989 than in any other year since World War II.<sup>33</sup><p><Li>The total industrial production index rose by about 30 percent from 1980 to 1990 and by about one-third during the Reagan recovery years of 1983 through 1990, about the same as total real economic growth. The more narrow manufacturing production index rose even faster, climbing by 39.5 percent from 1980 to 1990 and by 43.5 percent from 1983 to 1990.<sup>34</sup><p><li>Manufacturing productivity tripled, climbing almost 42 percent from 1980 to 1990 at a rate of 3.5 percent per year.<sup>35</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As a result of this sharp rise in productivity, U.S. manufacturing employment fell from 20 percent of total employment in 1980 to 16 percent in 1990, even though manufacturing output was near its highest-ever levels of GNP.<sup>36</sup>  Producing more and more with fewer workers is a sign of economic health and efficiency, not of failure.<p><b>Understanding the Trade Deficit</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Critics have made much of the fact that our trade deficit climbed from $19.4 billion in 1980 to $109.1 billion in 1984 and $145.4 billion in 1987 (see <a href="1980st14.gif">Table 14</a>). This is among the most meaningless economic statistics collected, however, and in no way indicates economic weakness during the Reagan years.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Deficits in the international trade in goods and services inevitably are balanced by surpluses in international capital transactions. A dollar earned overseas by selling to the United States ultimately can be used only to buy U.S. goods and services or to invest in the U.S. Therefore, dollars sent overseas for imports must be used to buy U.S. exports or to invest in the U.S., and total transactions must always balance. Even if the money is held overseas, the foreigner is investing in dollars, which is also a form of investment in the U.S.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

An inflow of capital investment means generally that foreign interests, instead of buying U.S. goods and services with money made by selling imports to the United States, are using it to buy capital assets in the U.S. The result is a deficit in trade, but a surplus in capital transactions. This is not a sign of economic deterioration, however; it is a sign of economic strength. It means the U.S. economy is strong enough to attract foreign capital investment to fuel still more economic growth.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This was the chief cause of the rising U.S. trade deficit during the 1980s. President Reagan's reductions in taxes, regulation, and inflation made the U.S. economy very attractive to foreign investors. The results:
<ul>
<p><li>Foreign private investment in the U.S. more than doubled in just two years, from $42.6billion in 1980 to $88.8 billion in 1982.

<p><li>By 1986, it had more than doubled again to $187.5 billion; by 1989, it had climbed to $205 billion (see <a href="1980st14.gif">Table 14</a>).
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The effect is similar when U.S. citizens who have been investing abroad bring their capital home. Foreign interests, because they no longer are receiving dollars from those investments, also cannot use these dollars to buy U.S. goods and services, offsetting U.S. purchases of goods and services overseas. Everything else being equal, the trade deficit will rise when U.S. capital investment overseas falls and U.S. investors put their money in the U.S.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This was another cause of our rising trade deficit; but like the inflow of capital investment from abroad, it is a sign of strength, not deterioration. It means the economy is attracting the increased investment that leads to still more economic growth. Under Ronald Reagan, the net outflow of U.S. investment abroad collapsed in just two years, from $111.2 billion in 1982 to $20.6 billion in 1984 (see <a href="1980st14.gif">Table 14</a>). Reductions in taxes, regulation, and inflation appealed to U.S. investors just as they did to foreign investors, leading them to bring their capital home to invest in the booming U.S. economy.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Booming economies also tend to run trade deficits, however. They import increased inputs from around the world to fuel their rapidly increasing production, which may be sold to their increasingly rich citizens rather than abroad, leaving a net trade deficit.<sup>37</sup>  This happened in the U.S. as the Reagan economy boomed from the end of 1982 to the middle of 1990, as discussed above.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The 1980s trade deficit certainly did not come about because U.S. goods and services were not competitive.
<ul>
<p><li>U.S. exports of manufactured goods rose by 90 percent from 1986 to 1992, compared to an increase of only 25 percent for the other leading industrial countries in the OECD. Our share of world manufacturing exports consequently increased from 14 percent in 1987 to 18 percent in 1991.<sup>38</sup><p><li>U.S. services are recognized as the best in the world, and net exports of those services multiplied by several times from 1986 to 1992.<sup>39</sup>  Exports accounted for 15.2 percent of GNP by 1990, up from 12.2 percent in 1980.<sup>40</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The U.S. ran a trade deficit for almost all of its first 100 years as it attracted tidal waves of foreign investment and its economy boomed, bringing in goods and services from around the world to fuel production and create the mightiest economic machine in world history. Trade deficits were an indication not of economic weakness, but of the skyrocketing economic strength of the new, free-market nation. During the Great Depression, by contrast, the U.S. ran trade surpluses.<sup>41</sup> Similarly, during the 100 years from Waterloo in 1815 to World War I in 1914, Britain dominated the world economically but also ran chronic trade deficits. As Wall Street financier Evan Galbraith has written, "America in the 1980s should be compared to Britain in its glory years, and not to a country that shows a trade deficit because its products are not competitive."<sup>42</sup>
<ul>
<p><li>By 1990, the trade deficit was falling rapidly, declining to $76.8 billion in that year (see <a href="1980st14.gif">Table 14</a>). Of course, U.S. economic growth all but disappeared during these years as well, as the Reagan boom ended in 1990. Just as the 1980s trade deficit was not a sign of economic weakness, its decline around the turn of the decade clearly was not a sign of economic strength.

<p><li>In line with the decline in the trade deficit, foreign investment in the U.S. dropped precipitously, from $205.2 billion in 1989 to $65.5 billion in 1990 and $48.6 billion in 1991 (see Table 14).

<p><li>Private U.S. investment abroad also had climbed back up to $71.4 billion in 1991, and the weak U.S. economy no longer was pulling imported inputs to fuel booming growth. These factors accounted for the decline in the trade deficit, just as their reverse accounted for its earlier increase.

</uL>
<p>
<b>Understanding Debt and Wealth</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The claim that the U.S. economy was burdened with excessive debt during the 1980s also is erroneous. Wealth soared, creating the capacity for additional debt, but debt generally increased no faster than the trends of earlier decades.
<ul>
<p><li>Real personal assets rose by nearly $6 trillion, from $15.5 trillion in 1980 to $21.1 trillion in 1990, an increase of 36 percent. Because the increase in real personal assets was three times the increase in personal debt (which rose by $1.8 trillion), personal real net worth rose by $3.8 trillion, or 29 percent.<sup>43</sup>

<p><li>The stock market more than tripled in value from 1980 to 1990, a larger increase than in any previous postwar decade. The ratio of corporate debt to market value of corporate assets was the same in 1989 as in 1969.<sup>44</sup><p><li>Total debt liabilities of all private, non-financial sectors rose at a rate of 5.4 percent, compared to 6.15 percent for the 1950s and 5.01 percent for the 1960s.<sup>45</sup>  This hardly seems excessive when compared to previous years.<p><li>Total real private net worth rose by $4.3 trillion from 1980 to 1989, at which time it totaled $17.1 trillion in constant 1987 dollars, an increase of about one-third over 1980.<sup>46</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another popular complaint has been that the United States became a "debtor nation" in the 1980s. The value of foreign investment in the United States exceeded the value of U.S. investment overseas for the first time in 1988, we are told, and the "investment deficit" has grown every year since then.<sup>47</sup>  This actually is another sign of economic strength, however, because it means the United States became more attractive to the world's investors.
<ul>
<p><li>U.S. investment income from overseas continued to exceed income to foreign interests from U.S. investments over this period by close to $20 billion per year.<sup>48</sup>  This indicates that a true valuation would show that U.S. investments overseas still are worth more than foreign investments in the U.S.<p><li>U.S. investments overseas are older on average, and their historical costs,upon which "debtor nation" statistics are based, underestimate their current market value even more as a result. The government has yet to find a way to account fully for the current market value of investments.

<p><li>Much foreign investment is equity investment, which represents no burden of repayment by the American people. It simply will earn the value of what it produces, with no guarantee of profits, as the increased capital invested enhances overall economic growth, jobs, and incomes.<sup>49</sup></ul><b>The Bottom Line: International Comparisons</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The United States today remains the wealthiest society on earth.<ul><p><li>Adjusting exchange rates for purchasing power parity, which compares what goods and services families in each country can buy, the U.S. standard of living is easily the highest in the world, exceeding West Germany's by about 25 percent and Japan's by about 40 percent.<sup>50</sup><p><li>Measured by actual physical conditions, the United States has much more and newer housing space, more cars per capita, more appliances, and more comforts generally than Western Europe, Japan, or any other nation or region.<sup>51</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some have argued that America is declining because the U.S. economy has fallen as a percentage of the world economy during the years since World War II. This decline stopped in about 1975, however, with the U.S. economy remaining through the 1980s about 34 percent as large as the rest of the world's economies combined.<sup>52</sup>  Moreover, after World War II, with most of the world's other major economies devastated by the war, the U.S. economy accounted for a huge percentage of the world economy.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One should hardly be surprised to find that our share of the world economy has declined as these other economies have rebuilt; nor should one be surprised or alarmed that it has declined further as some of the world's underdeveloped countries have learned to prosper. Far from indicating a problem with U.S. economic strength, these developments benefit the U.S. as well as the rest of the world. It would have been unrealistic indeed to expect our unusual postwar position relative to 
other countries not to decline as a result of the mutually beneficial and hoped-for economic development of those countries.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Virtually from the beginning of government in human society, death and taxes have been closely linked as well as inevitable. The passing of well-to-do individuals has been a lucrative moment for tax collectors. Most nations today impose death, estate, and inheritance taxes, and the United States is no exception.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This ancient practice, however, is beginning to change. Motivated by mounting evidence that death-related taxes may hold back the economic well-being of the living, several countries and American states recently have repealed their taxes on estates or significantly scaled them down. The U.S. Congress also is reexamining the wisdom of these taxes. Two bills, one in the House and another in the Senate, call for outright repeal of the estate and gift tax,<sup>1</sup> and dozens of others in both chambers propose significant modifications that give taxpayer relief.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Support for these proposals still comes primarily from advocates of limited government. But a growing number of liberals recently have shown a keen interest in repeal. Like so many critics of the estate tax, these new critics are disturbed by the growing evidence that this tax:
<ul>
<p><li>Reduces economic growth, hurting the jobs and incomes of the very people that wealth redistribution was intended to aid;

<p><li>Increases the cost of capital, slowing down research and development and the use of machines that would increase worker productivity -- and thus wages;

<p><li>Keeps interest rates on home loans and other major purchases higher than they should be; and

<p><li>Raises very little money -- in fact, it may cost the government and the taxpayers more in administrative and compliance fees than it raises in revenue.
</ul><p>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Current wealth taxation policy stems from the mistaken view that redistributing income leads to the redistribution of economic power. Nearly a century of wealth taxation, however, shows that well-to-do Americans (including a great number of middle-class families) simply find ways of legally avoiding the tax collector. Not only do they save less and consume more of their income, thus benefiting from the lower taxes on consumption, but they also make less productive investments, such as large life insurance policies and substantial charitable contributions, thus reducing the chances that their death will leave a large taxable estate. The policy of using the estate tax to redistribute economic power actually leads to a distorted distribution of consumption and a less productive economy. Both of these unexpected outcomes worsen the economic condition of the less economically powerful.
<p>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Founders understood the critical importance of reducing legal barriers to economic opportunity as the best public means of allowing every citizen to achieve economic fulfillment. This understanding found a home in the original U.S. Constitution, where direct taxes on wealth and income were prohibited except in time of national emergency. But soon after the ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment (which lifted the ban on federal income taxation) in 1913, the federal government began a 60-year effort to create a more democratic economy through the forcible redistribution of wealth. That policy has imposed costs on economic growth as well as fundamental liberties.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is time to repeal the estate, gift, and generation-skipping tax. The case for this turns on three factors: the diminishing importance of the estate tax as a federal revenue stream; the failure of the tax to achieve its public policy objectives, principally the creation of economic benefits for lower-income Americans; and the continuing damage the tax exacts on the economy in terms of jobs, output, and growth. Transcending all of these factors is the growing appreciation that wealth taxation infringes on fundamental liberties and is inconsistent with the principle of limited government.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If the estate tax were repealed, the effect on the economy would be significant. According to an econometric study conducted by Professor Richard Wagner of George Mason University, the effect of the estate tax on the cost of capital is so great that within eight years, a U.S. economy without an estate tax would be producing $80 billion more in annual output and would have created 250,000 additional jobs and a $640 billion larger capital stock.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;An analysis by The Heritage Foundation using two leading econometric models also found that repealing the estate tax would have a large and beneficial effect on the economy. Specifically, the Heritage analysis found that if the tax were repealed this year, over the next nine years:
<ul>
<p><li>The nation's economy would average as much as $11 billion per year in extra output;

<p><li>An average of 145,000 additional new jobs could be created;

<p><li>Personal income could rise by an average of $8 billion per year above current projections; and

<p><li>The deficit actually would decline, since revenues generated by extra growth would more than compensate for the meager revenues currently raised by the inefficient estate tax.
The estate tax has few friends, other than tax attorneys, and raises very little revenue at a heavy cost to the economy. It generates complex tax avoidance schemes. The hardest hit by the tax are small businesspeople who work hard to pass on an enterprise of value to their children. And its bias against saving and wealth generation is the antithesis of the American dream.
</ul><p>

<b>HOW WEALTH TAXES BEGAN IN AMERICA</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Current public policy on the taxation of intergenerational wealth stems from roots laid down in the American Revolution and, oddly enough, in the Revolutionaries' efforts to create a society in which all citizens would be free to become as wealthy as their talents allow. As with so many principles that trace back to the Revolutionary period, the liberty to acquire and dispose of personal property became, by the 20th century, subsidiary to another element of the country's founding: the drive to create democratic equality of economic opportunity.<sup>2</sup><p><b>The Early Years</b><p>Alexis de Tocqueville paid considerable attention to the views Americans held about wealth and economic opportunity when he made his famous tour of the early Republic in 1831. On the one hand, Americans had a nearly universal disdain for aristocracy and any non-republican show of wealth. But on the other hand, nearly everyone with whom Tocqueville became acquainted wanted desperately to be rich:
<blockquote>
	I do not mean that there is any lack of wealthy individuals in the United States; I know of no country, indeed, where the love of money has taken stronger hold on the affections of men and where a profounder contempt is expressed for the theory of the permanent equality of property. But wealth circulates with inconceivable rapidity, and experience shows that it is rare to find two succeeding generations in the full enjoyment of it.<sup>3</sup></blockquote><b>Removing Barriers to Wealth.</b> The democratization of acquiring wealth constituted the touchstone of the new civilization that the Revolutionaries sought to build. Theirs was a battle against barriers erected in the Old World to prevent the rise of the common man. For centuries, laws had been applied differently to rich and poor people. The Revolutionaries overturned this by embracing the legal principle of equality before the law, extending it to all free Americans, and giving it the sharp legal teeth of natural liberty in one's life and property. They freed labor and capital from taxes, turned over to communities virtually all regulation of commerce, and tried in many other ways to remove government from everyday life. This truly was the age of the individual. Liberated from the oppressive economic and social networks that had surrounded the Crown and that prevented ordinary people from rising, the Revolutionaries emphasized the importance of allowing the marketplace rather than birth and influence to be the measure of personal worth. As Gordon Wood writes in his Pulitzer Prize-winning history of this period,
<blockquote>
	A man was now praised for having arrived and risen "without friends," for having been "the architect of his own fortune," or for never having been "borne on the shoulders of patronage."  For many Americans the ability to make money -- not whom one knew, or who one's father was, or where one went to college -- now became the only proper democratic means for distinguishing one man from another.<sup>4</sup></blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Nothing epitomizes the zeal of the Revolutionaries for fundamentally altering the process of acquiring wealth better than the rapid abolition of primogeniture and the narrowing of entail. The ancient practice of primogeniture settled the entirety of an estate on the first-born male, thus leaving the remaining male children and all female children without inheritance. Primogeniture made birth order rather than merit the principal cause of wealth. Thus, dullards were as likely as commercial geniuses to end up ruling vast properties and exercising immense social and political influence. Entail nicely complemented primogeniture by making it all but impossible for real estate to leave a family, no matter how desirous a family one day might be to part with the property or how badly they managed their estate. Together, primogeniture and entail put a gigantic weight around the neck of economic progress and reduced the rate of commercial improvement to an obese creep.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Thomas Jefferson, himself initially a victim of primogeniture and then its beneficiary upon the death of his older brother, vigorously opposed both practices and saw legislation that he had written in 1777 abolishing primogeniture passed by the Virginia House of Burgesses in 1785. Within a few years, every new state government had followed Virginia's lead, and no subsequent state ever seriously considered allowing it. For Jefferson, the reform of entail and abolition of primogeniture were two of the most important actions taken in the early Republic to create "a system by which every fibre would be eradicated of ancient or future aristocracy, and a foundation laid for a government truly republican."<sup>5</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even a cursory reading of the Revolutionary texts underscores this unrelenting focus of the Founders on removing barriers to the wealth-creating process. Early American public policy was not aimed at redistributing wealth or at restraining its growth. Rather, the early Republic pursued a public policy of removing obstacles to entrepreneurship and economic self-improvement. If an egalitarian theme was present in early American public policy, it was the theme of equality before the law, which often meant the elimination of legal privileges that gave one class an economic advantage over another.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This attitude to wealth creation can be found in the Constitution of the United States. A straightforward reading of the following paragraph from Article I, Section 9 appears to prohibit all direct taxes, which would include a prohibition against taxes on income and wealth: "No Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion to the Census or Enumeration herein before directed to be taken."<sup>6</sup><p><b>Changing Attitudes Toward Wealth and Taxation</b><p><b>National Emergencies.</b> It was generally accepted during the 19th century that Congress had extensive authority to bend the Constitution during times of national emergency. For example, the writ of <I>habeas corpus</i> could be suspended in times of war or rebellion in order to advance the public good. Thus, it appeared well within Congress's emergency powers to impose taxes on wealth and inheritance to meet the wholly unexpected revenue requirements of the federal government during dangerous times.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Congress wasted no time in testing its expansive wartime authority: Taxes on estates were imposed first during the Quasi-War with France (1797-1799), but repealed in 1802. Still, had it not been for the Civil War, it is possible that after 1802, the 19th century would have been an uninterrupted period of no estate or intergenerational wealth taxation. But the expenses of the Union government exhausted its revenue sources so quickly that President Lincoln and the war Congresses employed the emergency clauses of the Constitution to enact the first modern intergenerational wealth tax. The Revenue Act of 1862 revived the death tax of the Quasi-War Congress and recrafted it into a true inheritance tax. Congress repealed the tax on wealth in 1870.<sup>7</sup><p><b>Wealth Seen As an Obstacle to Economic Opportunity.</b> While costly national emergencies occasionally challenged the idea of unrestricted wealth creation and ownership, more important in the long run was a change of attitude in some circles toward the relationship between wealth and economic opportunity. Between 1880 and 1916, the party of Lincoln overflowed with political warriors who saw no American problem that could not be solved by righteous citizens wielding the policy tools of the newly powerful federal government. Just as they had overcome the Southern assertion of states' rights, they would be victorious over the growing concentrations of private economic power that they viewed as fundamentally threatening the bedrock American value of equal economic opportunity.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The reform Republicans created many tools for achieving their "new economic democracy," but perhaps none was so important to this project as the income tax. If the principal post-war threat to the Republic came from the great wealth that industrialization created for a few privileged people, and from the opportunities this wealth provided for corrupting political institutions, reformers needed above all else a legal means of redistributing wealth, thus diffusing the political power that great wealth provided. In 1894, Congress took its first tentative step in this direction by passing the Income Tax Act. Significantly, the heart of the Act was a definition of gifts and inheritances as income.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Supreme Court wasted little time in striking down the Income Tax Act. In 1895, the Court ruled<sup>8</sup> that the Act constituted a direct tax on certain forms of income that did not meet the Constitution's requirement of apportioning such a tax according to population. Without a change in the Constitution, the Court concluded, all such efforts at taxing income would fail to pass constitutional review.<p>The constitutional obstacle was removed in 1913 with ratification of the Sixteenth Amendment.<sup>9</sup>  Congress quickly passed an income tax in 1914 that levied a 3 percent rate on all incomes above $30,000 (about $900,000 in 1996 dollars).<sup>10</sup>  It then launched the modern period of estate and gift taxation through the Revenue Act of 1916.<p>The Revenue Act of 1916 established rules for valuing a decedent's estate, for capturing taxable lifetime transfers into the estate, and for determining those transfers made for inadequate consideration and those that became effective only upon death. It created exemptions and deductions that continue to be a part of estate tax law today. Most important, the Act introduced progressive taxation into estate tax policy.<sup>11</sup>  This element clearly distinguished its public policy objective from earlier death taxes: The central mission of federal estate and gift taxation would be the redistribution of wealth.<sup>12</sup><p>After 1916, and despite a few efforts to retreat from estate and gift taxation immediately following World War I, taxes on intergenerational wealth transfers became a permanent feature of U.S. tax policy.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The history of wealth transfer taxation between 1920 and 1976 consisted largely of expanding the tax base for estate and gift taxes and increasing the tax rates. Congress raised the top marginal rate for estate taxes to 40 percent in 1924. In 1932, the top rate rose to 45 percent and the gift tax became permanent. The imminence of hostilities in 1941 caused Congress to search for additional revenues and led to a further increase in the top rate on estates to 77 percent.<sup>13</sup><p>Figure 1 shows the rapid increase in estate and gift tax collections after the end of World War II. Intergenerational taxes grew significantly in both amount and rate, even when adjusted for inflation. This growth probably stemmed as much from the demographics of the transfer taxes as from high tax rates: The late 1960s saw the beginning of generational transfers from those Americans who had weathered the storms of depression and world war. Transfers increasingly consisted of small businesses and farms as well as stocks, bonds, and liquid assets. And as the number of taxable estates containing businesses grew, so did the pressure for estate tax relief.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Congress recognized in 1976 that a tax intended to diminish the power of great wealth more frequently ended up taxing ordinary Americans who had accumulated taxable estates through nothing more than frugality, entrepreneurship, and plain hard work. The Tax Reform Act of 1976 addressed the concerns of these people through a number of policy changes. Specifically, the Act:
<ul>
<p><li>Unified the estate and gift tax, enabling taxpayers to apply unused gift tax allowances as deductions against their taxable estates;

<p><li>Lowered the top marginal rate to 70 percent and expanded the marital deductions for estates of moderate size; and

<p><li>Created special rules for estates consisting primarily of small businesses and family farms that allowed more of these entities to escape estate taxes altogether.<sup>14</sup></ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Congress's eagerness in 1976 to address problems with intergenerational taxation coincided with a growing understanding among many academics and politicians that high tax rates retard economic growth.<sup>15</sup>  This growing awareness led the Congresses of the 1980s to reduce the economic influence of intergenerational taxes, largely through tax cuts and more generous deductions. The Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 in particular reflected this redirection in public policy. For example, the Act created the unified credit that currently exempts the first $600,000 in an otherwise taxable estate from any tax liability,<sup>16</sup> and it cut the top marginal rate from 70 percent to 50 percent. In addition, the Act further liberalized the rules governing the tax valuation of closely held businesses and farms, and lengthened the period of time for the payment of estate taxes by estates that contain such businesses.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

With few exceptions, tax and budget bills passed between 1981 and 1992 adhered to the policy changes contained in the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981.<sup>17</sup>  Even in the largest tax increase in U.S. history -- the Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1993 -- it was apparent that revenue goals and not class warfare was the basis of the wealth tax provision. While Congress added two new rates (53 percent and 55 percent) to the estate and gift tax, these still did not go above Ronald Reagan's top rate. And while two new income tax rates (35 percent and 39.6 percent) were enacted, they still were just over half as high as the nearly confiscatory rates that prevailed during the administration of Dwight Eisenhower. In fact, without notice, wealth transfer tax policy has lost its ideological thrust. Its philosophical justification is disappearing; its roots in public policy are growing shorter every year; and its retention depends on its value as a revenue-raiser. But as we shall see later, besides its damaging impact on wealth creation and economic well-being, as a source of revenue it is more trouble than it is worth.<sup>18</sup><p><b>THE ESTATE AND GIFT TAX TODAY</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Current federal wealth transfer law is a confusing maze through which only the bravest taxpayers will travel without an experienced guide. The federal government taxes intergenerational wealth transfers through the estate, gift, and generation-skipping tax systems.<sup>19</sup><p>

<b>The Estate Tax</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The largest component of the federal government's three-part wealth taxation system is the estate tax. Current estate tax law itself has three basic elements: 1) definition of the estate tax base, or the gross estate of a decedent; 2) deductions that can be made from the gross estate to arrive at the taxable estate; and 3) the computation of estate tax liability.
<ol>
	<p><li><b>The Tax Base</b><p><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Estate tax law defines the gross estate of a decedent as the "fair market value"<sup>20</sup> of all personal or real property, wherever situated and however tangible, at the time of the decedent's death.<sup>21</sup>  This valuation of an estate's property attempts to quantify such property at its "highest and best use."  However, the valuation of a business or a farm on a "fair market value" standard may actually result in an artificially low value of an ongoing enterprise. For example, consider a start-up business in a good part of town. The owner suddenly dies, and his son wants to continue the business. If the estate tax value is determined by recent sales of other businesses located near it, then it may be valued at an amount well above its actual worth based on the cash generated by the business (which may even be operating at a loss in this early phase). This makes a big difference to an estate, since the business may have to be sold in order to pay the estate tax because the son is unable to raise a loan to pay the tax. In 1976, Congress recognized this negative potential of the "fair market value" rule and permitted estates containing small businesses and farms to be valued at their present use rather than at their "market value."<sup>22</sup><ul><p><li><b>Insurance Policies.</b> Special rules apply to the value of insurance policies contained in the decedent's estate. If the life insurance policy is paid out to benefit the estate, of if the decedent either held a property right in the policy or conveyed this property right within three years of death, then the value of the policy is added to the gross estate. A similar rule applies to annuities.<sup>23</sup><p><li><b>Joint Property.</b> A property rights rule also applies to property owned jointly by the decedent and someone other than the decedent's spouse: Such jointly owned property is included in the gross estate to the extent of the ratio of consideration furnished. With respect to property owned jointly with a surviving spouse, only 50 perc
ent of such property becomes a part of the gross estate.<sup>24</sup><p><li><b>Gifts.</b> Gifts and other transfers of property made by the decedent well before death also may be included in the gross estate if the decedent retained the ability to influence the disposition and use of such property. Similar inclusion in the gross estate applies to gifts that occur only upon death. However, sales of property and other alienation of property from the decedent's control made throughout his or her life are not included in gross estate.</ul>	<p><li>Deductions
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Once the total value of an estate has been calculated, numerous deductions may be applied. The result of these subtractions from the gross estate is the taxable estate.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	
The first category of deductions relates to direct expenses of the estate: All costs of the funeral, of legal claims against the estate, of the executor's administration of the estate, and of mortgages paid by the estate may be deducted.<sup>25</sup>  Second, the value of property passing to the decedent's surviving spouse may be deducted. Finally, the estate may deduct the value of all charitable bequests to organizations recognized by the federal government as tax-exempt.

<p><li><b>Tax Liability</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


The taxable estate that results from the application of these gross estate deductions is taxed according to a somewhat cumbersome four-step process. First, the value of all taxable gifts made over the decedent's lifetime is added to the net estate. Second, a before-credits tax is calculated by multiplying this "grossed up" estate by the relevant tax rate. Third, this before-credits tax is reduced by subtracting the tax on all gifts made after 1976. And fourth, various credits are applied to the remaining sum.<sup>26</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are four credits available for estate tax reduction, but by far the most significant is the unified transfer tax credit.<sup>27</sup>  This credit is a flat $192,800, which equates to a $600,000 net taxable estate. Thus, the unified transfer tax credit means that current law exempts from taxation all otherwise taxable estates up to $600,000 in value.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Above $600,000, estates face a tax rate table that contains no fewer than 17 different rates, ranging from 18 percent to 55 percent. There is a 5 percent surcharge for estates between $10,000,000 and $21,040,000, intended to phase out the unified transfer credit. Thus, estates up to $21 million in value face a 60 percent marginal rate.<sup>28</sup></ol><p><b>The Gift Tax</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The second layer of federal wealth transfer taxation is the levy made on lifetime property gifts. Like the definition of gross estate, current law contains a host of decisions that the courts and executors must make in determining the value of taxable gifts.<ol>	<p><li><b>The Tax Base.</b> <p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps the most difficult decision of all is the one that must be made first: determining the value of the decedent's lifetime giving. This difficulty arises on two fronts:
<ul><p><li>
<b>First,</b> a gift is the transfer of property for something less than full legal consideration to a party generally within the donor's family. On the one hand, the executor must determine which gift transfers meet the test of insufficient legal consideration. On the other hand, the executor must distinguish gifts made for income tax purposes that require "detached and disinterested generosity" from those that qualify for the gift tax.<sup>29</sup><p><li><b>Second,</b> the executor or the court must wrestle with the question of "fair market value."  The federal gift tax requires that <i>all</i> wealth transfers made as gifts over the decedent's entire life be valued for taxation. That means, incredibly, that appraisals of value must be made for gifts made decades before the decedent's death. Moreover, these gifts must be appraised in terms of their "fair market value" at the time they were made, which is a task that often stretches the frontiers of property appraisal to its breaking point.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Such extraordinary efforts at valuation and record reconstruction must be made in order to determine whether the annual level of gift giving exceeded the allowed limits. An estate may exclude from the gift tax base all annual present interest gift transfers of $10,000 or less per donee.<sup>30</sup>  But if the donor made the gift to meet the donee's tuition or medical expenses, the limit does not apply. Furthermore, if the donor's spouse elects to make a similar gift to the same donee (a practice known as gift-splitting), the annual limit rises to $20,000. All gifts above these limits become part of the gift tax base.

	<p><li><b>Deductions.</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 

Like the estate tax base, the gift tax base can be reduced by certain deductions. Besides gift-splitting, certain gifts to one's spouse may be deducted. Also, gifts to charities recognized by the IRS as tax-exempt organizations can be deducted from the gift tax base.<sup>31</sup>  Finally, special rules apply to the division of property in a divorce or separation, and this leads to more gift tax deductions.<sup>32</sup>	<p><li><b>Tax Liability.</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Computing the amount of gift tax is relatively simple. First, taxable gifts for the current and all previous calendar years are summed and taxed using the tax rate table for estates. Second, this total amount of gift tax then is reduced by any unused unified transfer tax credit.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To illustrate, suppose that a married couple gave their only child $10,000 a year for a period of 20 years, for a cumulative total of $200,000. These gifts equal the maximum annual amount that taxpayers may exclude from the federal gift tax base. However, for four years this couple made additional gifts to their child of $100,000 a year, for a total of $400,000. This latter amount is above the limit and is taxable. Now suppose that the gross taxable estate of this couple equals $1,000,000, which includes the taxable gifts. The executor of the estate will use the unified credit of $600,000 to reduce the taxable amount and will pay taxes on the remaining $400,000, or the additional gifts the couple gave their child.
</ol><p>

<b>The Generation-Skipping Tax</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Wealth transfer taxes have been so consistently high throughout this century that a substantial cottage industry devoted to estate tax avoidance has blossomed within the legal and financial communities. One of their cleverest inventions was a trust established by a parent for the lifetime benefit of his or her children that passed tax-free to the parent's grandchildren upon the parent's death (or bypassed the children completely and went directly to the grandchildren). The trust avoided estate taxes altogether because such taxes are never levied on amounts that cannot be controlled by the taxpayer. However, some trusts were designed to pay out to the grandchildren upon the death of the taxpayer's children. Thus, the taxpayer could target specific individuals to receive benefits from the estate if the taxpayer could skip a generation through the creative use of a tax-free trust.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress enacted a cumbersome tax law change in 1976 to close the indirect generation-skipping transfer, but it left unaddressed the trust or bequest that directly skipped the parent's children. Both of these loopholes were addressed by Congress in 1986. As part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, Congress established a flat-rate tax of 55 percent on all generation-skipping transfers. Transfers subject to the tax are those made from a trust to a "skip person" (someone two or more generations removed from the donor); those made by a donor directly to a "skip person" without going through a trust; and those that result from termination of an interest in a property or trust, which usually happens upon the death of the donor.<sup>33</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As with the estate tax and the gift tax, several exclusions and exemptions apply. The same $10,000 annual exclusion and tuition and medical exemptions found in the gift tax law apply to generation-skipping taxes. A total lifetime exclusion of $1,000,000 ($2,000,000 for married couples) is allowed. Finally, transfers made prior to January 1, 1990, are exempt up to $2,000,000 ($4,000,000 for married couples).<sup>34</sup><p><b>THE LIBERAL CASE FOR REPEALING THE ESTATE TAX</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This complex tax edifice rests on the foundation that taxing intergenerational wealth transfers results in less concentrated wealth holdings and that this leads in turn to greater economic opportunity and a more democratic society. Certainly simplicity cannot be raised in support of this tax policy, as the above discussion indicates. And, as Figures 1 and 2 show, the estate and gift tax cannot be justified as playing an important role in financing government: The unified estate and gift tax now brings in less than 1.7 percent of total federal revenues.
<p>

<b>The Liberal Egalitarian Argument for Intergenerational Wealth Taxation</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The case for the estate tax turns on the tax's effectiveness in achieving greater economic democracy through the redistribution of wealth. If its supporters cannot sustain the argument that the estate tax improves equality of economic opportunity, then there exists little else (except perhaps inertia) to recommend continuation of this part of U.S. tax policy. Other, simpler taxes could meet revenue objectives far more efficiently.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Academic support for intergenerational wealth taxation remains warm, in large part because of the role it plays in the most important theoretical treatise on liberal egalitarianism, John Rawls's <i>A Theory of Justice.</i><sup>35</sup>  Since its publication in 1971, this careful, magisterial presentation of the case for liberal democracy infused with just institutions has permeated thinking on most issues in social and political theory. It is fair to say that no stronger theoretical case for intergenerational wealth taxation exists.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

At the center of Rawls's case for wealth taxation is the principle that "[a]ll social primary goods -- liberty and opportunity, income and wealth, and the bases of self-respect -- are to be distributed equally unless an unequal distribution of any or all of these goods is to the advantage of the least favored."<sup>36</sup>  While at first blush this principle would appear to suggest radical egalitarianism in economic and political life, Rawls recognizes the superiority of "free" over socialized markets to produce benefits for the least advantaged citizens, which leads him and many like-minded political theorists to support significant differences in the economic conditions of individuals within a generation. After a century of economic experimentation, there can be little doubt that everyone achieves greater economic benefit when individuals are allowed to discover their own comparative advantage and focus their labor in the area where they can make the greatest economic difference.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This tolerance for intragenerational differences leads Rawls to oppose all income taxes, since economic income stems from natural differences in talent and from differing propensities of individuals to apply themselves to hard work.<sup>37</sup>  However, two principled considerations compel Rawls to take substantial exception to intergenerational differences in economic condition.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<b>First,</b> Rawls opposes the transfer of accumulated property to succeeding generations because it undermines the first principle of a just society: that everyone has "an equal right to the most extensive total system of equal basic liberties compatible with a similar system of liberty for all."<sup>38</sup>  Those who begin with a significant unearned endowment of property resources place others not so advantaged in a less equal condition, and this undermines the principle that everyone should have access to the same system of equal basic liberties.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<b>Second,</b> this difference might be tolerated if it produced greater benefits for the least advantaged than for the advantaged. However, intergenerational wealth transfers create benefits that flow in the opposite direction: Over time, they enhance the advantages of inheriting generations and generally degrade the liberties of the unbenefitted. Thus, "[t]he taxation of inheritance and income at progressive rates (when necessary), and the legal definition of property rights, are to secure the institutions of equal liberty in a property-owning democracy and the fair value of the rights they establish."<sup>39</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;While Rawls does not advance confiscatory taxation of intergenerational wealth transfers, his argument does imply substantial taxing discretion by the state. In his universe, the state guides the institutions of distribution; should government determine that wealth transfers constitute significant barriers to the equal enjoyment of liberties (as defined by Rawls), it clearly has the power to tax away as much of the wealth that moves between generations as it deems necessary to restore justice.

<p>
<b>Objections to the Liberal Egalitarian Case for the Estate Tax</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A number of objections could be raised against the Rawlsian case for wealth transfer taxation, not the least of them being the questionable assertion of government authority over the intergenerational disposition of private property. If wealth is acquired legally and transferred peacefully (that is, in some non-tortious fashion that breaches no contract pertaining to the property), government has no ethical standing to interfere with its disposition.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Of course, liberal egalitarians claim a more expansive role for government, a principal element of which is the progressive enhancement of equality of condition among citizens. Thus, it is important first to consider the estate tax within the context of the argument that justifies the tax's existence. If it can be shown that the estate tax does not advance the ethical program of the liberal egalitarians, then other objections to this tax that can be raised without assuming this ethical and moral framework become more compelling.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This approach to analyzing the estate tax was taken in a seminal monograph by Edward J. McCaffery published in <i>The Yale Law Journal</i> in 1994.<sup>40</sup>  Professor McCaffery comes to the debate over the estate tax with impeccable political credentials. Unlike many critics of intergenerational taxation who frame their objections within a larger, politically conservative analysis of contemporary government, MaCaffery formulated his critique of the estate tax within a liberal framework. As he stated last year before the U.S. Senate Committee on Finance:<blockquote>	I am an unrequited liberal, in both the classical and contemporary political senses of that word, whose views on social and distributive justice might best be described as progressive. I used to believe in the gift and estate tax as a vehicle for obtaining justice. As to the latter belief, only, I am now prepared to confess that I "was blind, but now can see."<sup>41</sup></blockquote><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;McCaffery raises five general objections to the liberal egalitarian argument supporting intergenerational wealth taxation. Each of them assumes the ethical and moral objectives of the liberal political program.
<ol>
<p><li><b>The currently combined income and estate tax system encourages large <i>inter vivos</i> gift transfers, which have the effect of creating a greater inequality of starting points or a less level economic playing field.</b> This predictable effect of the estate tax law is aggravated further by the fact that high estate tax rates encourage the consumption rather than the transfer of wealth. Purchasing goods and services instead of saving the funds that support that consumption produces larger differences between rich and poor people. Thus, the estate tax is illiberal because it undermines rather than advances the liberal egalitarian objective of equality of economic opportunity.

<p><li><b>While higher wealth transfer taxes might reduce the level of <i>inter vivos</i> gifts, and other tax law changes could be made to penalize the spending behavior of rich families, it currently is both practically and politically impossible to do so.</b> On the one hand, analysts are becoming increasingly aware of the intergenerational focus of much current saving behavior at all income levels. Liberals should promote the creation of transferable wealth among the less advantaged. On the other hand, politicians are becoming increasingly aware of how much voters want taxes to fall, not rise. The estate or inheritance tax has been repealed in Australia, Canada, Israel, and California; and the movement for tax reform is a spreading, worldwide movement.
<p>
<p><li><b>There will always be differences between the starting conditions of people in a non-ideal world.</b> If liberal egalitarians attempted to eliminate all the differences that stem from intergenerational wealth transfers, they would risk leaving the least advantaged even worse off than they were before. Not only would confiscatory taxation reduce the consumption behavior of wealthy people, thereby also reducing employment and incomes among poorer citizens, but it would depress the amount of economic capital as well, thereby reducing economic expansion and income growth, both of which are central to improving the conditions of the least advantaged.
<p>
<p><li><b>"[It] is the use and not the mere concentration of wealth that threatens reasonable liberal values."</b><sup>42</sup>  Generally speaking, the accumulation of savings and the promotion of earnings that underlie the growth of savings are "goods" that liberals like. Earnings and savings create a "common pool" of resources that can be used to promote improvements in the general welfare through public and private means. Liberals generally regard the consumption behavior of the wealthy as objectionable; thus, wealth transfer taxation, which attacks savings and promotes wanton consumption, is wholly ill-suited to the attainment of an ideal liberal society.

<p><li><b>The best tax policy that liberal egalitarians could pursue, if attaining liberal social and political objectives truly motivates the liberal program, is one that taxes consumption, not savings.</b> McCaffery writes that:<blockquote>

	[b]y getting our reasonable political judgments wrong -- by taxing work and savings while condoning, even encouraging large-scale use [consumption] -- the status quo impedes the liberal project....  The real threats to liberty and equality from private possession alone turn out, on closer scrutiny, to relate to possession <i>qua</i> potential or actual use, each of which can be addressed -- indeed, can <i>best</i> be addressed -- in a tax system without an estate tax.<sup>43</sup>
</ol><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Not only, then, is the estate tax inconsistent with a liberal program of promoting equality of economic condition, but it encourages behavior that works against liberal objectives. It supports consumption and depletion by penalizing savings and earnings. It encourages the kind of strange world where it costs less for a millionaire like Steve Forbes to spend $30 million of his own money on a presidential campaign than to save $30 million for his children's future -- an investment upon which he will pay a 55 percent transfer tax as opposed to a campaign expenditure upon which no additional taxes are ever levied. How many new jobs and new businesses did Mr. Forbes's campaign create as opposed to the same amount saved in a bank that lends the funds to entrepreneurs and business managers?  Liberals and conservatives are beginning to answer this question in precisely the same way.
</ol>
<b>Few Friends.</b> The weaknesses of the estate and income tax system as a tool for redistribution long have been known, even to its academic friends. Joseph Stiglitz, who now serves as the Chairman of President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, concluded in 1978 that the estate tax effectively transfers resources from the saver to the spender, which, absent any offsetting tax policy change, reduces the stock of capital and leads to lower levels of national wealth.<sup>44</sup>  Furthermore, wrote Stiglitz,
<blockquote>
	because of capital accumulation effects, the estate tax may not achieve the objective to which it is presumably directed, that is, equalizing the distribution of income; if the government takes actions to offset these accumulation effects, the tax will lead to an increase in equality of income and wealth. The desirability of the estate tax may still be questioned, not only because of the distortions which it introduces but also because it may actually increase inequality in the distribution of consumption.<sup>45</sup>
</blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Alan Blinder, another member of the President's initial Council of Economic Advisers and subsequently Vice-Chairman of the Federal Reserve System's Board of Governors, also has raised serious doubts about the redistributional promises of the estate tax.<sup>46</sup>  He has been joined by Michael Boskin, Martin Feldstein, Gary Becker, Laurence Kotlikoff, Lawrence Summers, and many other economists with prominent connections to mainstream economics.<sup>47</sup>


<p><b>THE ECONOMIC CASE AGAINST THE ESTATE TAX</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In addition to the Left's declining enthusiasm for the ideology of wealth taxes, two economic issues have added to the momentum for repeal. One is the mounting weight of economic and financial evidence against the estate and gift tax as such. The other is the rapidly spreading general view that income taxes and the multiple taxation of savings reduce economic growth, which in turn slows the rate of economic improvement by the least advantaged. Among the economic problems associated with the tax:
<ul>
<p><li><b>The estate tax raises little money and encourages inefficient tax-avoidance schemes.</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 
Bolstering the skepticism about the efficiency of the estate and gift tax is the striking fact of how little revenue it raises for the federal government. Despite the tax's broad reach, theoretically touching upon nearly all transferable wealth, the unified tax raised only $14.7 billion in 1995.<sup>48</sup>  As Figure 1 shows, the estate and gift tax consistently has fallen as a percentage of total federal revenues, while at the same time the total amount of wealth has risen dramatically.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

When a tax raises significantly less than the estimate of its potential, it is often because taxpayers have discovered ways to avoid the tax and have changed their economic behavior in ways that reduce the pool of funds from which the tax is drawn. To understand the extent to which this happens, it is necessary to estimate just what estate tax collections theoretically should look like.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Public finance economists have struggled for a long time with this question. Producing an adequate answer, however, requires knowing a great deal more than we now do about the size of legal tax avoidance and the degree to which taxpayers change their economic behavior in order to reduce their estate tax liabilities. Moreover, economists do not know the size of the wealth pool within which estates are formed. The Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis periodically estimates household net worth, or the sum of durables, savings, and equities held by households.<sup>49</sup>  The Bureau currently estimates this net worth to be about $26.4 trillion, of which $8.4 trillion is in equities. While this amount by no means constitutes the tax base for the estate tax, a portion of this enormous sum most certainly does. For example, Laurence J. Kotlikoff estimates that slightly more than 50 percent of household wealth is held as intergenerational savings.<sup>50</sup>  If one assumes that this 50 percent (or $13.2 trillion) is transferred in equal amounts over two generations, or 46 years, then about $290 billion annually is moving to the next generation.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Even this figure probably overstates the tax base for the estate tax. Many economists argue that taxpayers who believe they will pay estate taxes will change their economic behavior in ways that result in a huge shrinkage of the estate tax base.<sup>51</sup>  B. Douglas Bernheim argues that high estate tax rates lead taxpayers to make far more cash gifts to their children than they otherwise would, in large part because their children pay taxes at lower rates than they do. Bernheim estimates that 50 percent to 75 percent of all intergenerational gifts are made because of the estate tax. Charitable gifts and other revenue losses are between 70 percent and 80 percent of total estate tax revenue. Put another way, indirect revenue losses in 1995 might have been $11 billion on revenues of $14.7 billion.<sup>52</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The revenue data strongly imply significant tax avoidance and other economic behavior that responds to high tax rates by moving national wealth (and thus taxable estates) from savings to consumption. It is exceptionally difficult, however, for analysts to go from implication to quantification. Recent breakthroughs in the economic understanding of household savings may lead ultimately to convincing estimates of how much savings behavior stems from income and estate tax policy. Even so, economists can offer a number of important insights about the deleterious economic effects of tax policy on economic performance.
<p>
<li><b>The estate tax discourages savings.</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Savings take many different forms -- cash reserves in a bank, stock in a corporation, art, land, housing, ownership of a business, and so forth -- that serve many different purposes. Households hold cash in a bank largely to finance future consumption, like the purchase of a house, or as a hedge against unanticipated household expenses like costly medical care. Similarly, the equity component of a mortgage is designed to be used to purchase future housing. These two forms of savings are largely liquid and thus earn relatively low rates of return. Households put money in a bank with the understanding that their funds can be withdrawn virtually at any time the household prefers. The bank, in turn, lends these savings with this same understanding in mind, and therefore prefers relatively short-term, low-risk loans that contain significant liquidity for the bank. So if a household saves in a long-term time deposit (for example, a 10-year certificate of deposit), it will demand a higher rate of return as compensation for not having these funds available for consumption. The bank, in turn, is freer to invest in riskier ventures for which it also can demand a higher rate of return. The bank's cost of a loan failure also falls when it is working with longer-term savings: It knows it has a certain period of time to make successful loans that cover its contract with the saver and yield the bank a profit.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The decision to save largely follows this simple story. When households consume most of their income, any long-term investment must earn a high return. However, when they increase their savings relative to their consumption of income, they require less compensation for foregone consumption, and the required rate of return falls. Economists are divided between those who believe that households have a relatively fixed savings percentage over their lifetimes (which implies relatively fixed time preferences) and those who see the percentage of savings as something that fluctuates as certain preferences (including time or consumption) and costs (particularly taxes) change. It is this latter viewpoint that is particularly relevant to estate tax analysis.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Taxes play a role in savings decisions because they increase the cost of saving relative to consuming income. For example, if a household invests 25 percent of its income after taxes in a bank account that earns interest, it will pay additional taxes on any interest it takes as income. If another household decides to invest its 25 percent in corporate stocks, it will pay additional taxes on any capital gains it takes as income. However, if both households take that same 25 percent of after-tax income and buy expensive shoes, no additional income taxes will be collected. No doubt sales taxes will be collected on the shoe purchases, but sales tax rates are almost always less than the income tax rate one would pay on the same amount of money. Thus, taxes discourage saving by increasing its cost relative to consumption. If the household saves anyway, it will demand a higher rate of return to compensate it for the taxes it must pay on interest earnings. Likewise, a household purchasing stocks will demand a higher and more secure rate of return on its stocks. In both cases, the cost of capital to the borrower -- to the bank or to the corporation -- has risen because of taxes.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

One way for a household to save and avoid additional taxation is to purchase an asset like art or land that appreciates slowly over a very long period of time. This kind of purchase, however, also increases the economy-wide cost of capital by reducing the fund of money available to banks and businesses. Still another way to reduce the tax cost of saving is to invest in tax-advantaged funds, such as IRAs or 403(b) and 401(k) plans. These types of funds annuitize savings, which means essentially that only low-risk, long-term, low-yield to medium-yield investments will be supported by them. While they do reduce current tax liabilities, they are especially costly for the saver in two ways: In addition to shrouding these plans in penalties and taxes should they be liquidated before the saver reaches a certain age, the government has significantly discounted the future value of these savings by delaying taxes on earnings until they are at their highest level.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The unified estate and gift tax adds yet another layer of taxes on any savings decision a household makes. Successful saving always raises the possibility of creating a taxable estate, at which point the tax cost of a dollar saved increases by an amount somewhere between 7.4 cents and 55 cents. So if the household persists in its decision to save, it will require some long-term premium return on its investments roughly equal to its estimate that estate taxes will not be avoided. Naturally, this premium further increases the cost of capital.

<p><li><b>The estate tax hurts small business.</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Investing in a business is one of the many forms of saving -- for some families, the only form. For most small firms, every available dollar goes into the family business -- the dry-cleaning business, the restaurant, the trucking company -- because the business creates an asset for the children and incomes for the owners. Women re-entering the work force after raising children often find self-employment the only entry-level employment open to them. Minorities know the reasons for self-employment only too well.
</ul><p><b>
Minorities Hit Hard.</b> All of the financial security provided by these businesses is put at risk if the owner dies with a taxable estate. In an important 1995 study of how minority businesses perceive the estate tax,<sup>53</sup> Joseph Astrachan and Craig Aronoff found that:
<ul>
<p><li>Some 90 percent of the surveyed minority businesses knew that they might be subject to the federal estate tax;

<p><li>About 67 percent of these businesses had taken steps (including gifts of stock, ownership restructuring, life insurance purchases, and buy/sell agreements) to shelter their assets from taxation;

<p><li>Over 50 percent of these same businesses indicated that they would not have taken these steps had there been no estate tax; and

<p><li>Some 58 percent of all the businesses in the survey anticipated failure or great difficulty surviving after determining their estate taxes.<sup>54</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Astrachan/Aronoff study echoes findings in a 1994 study by Patrick Fleenor and J. D. Foster of the Tax Foundation, a Washington-based tax policy organization,<sup>55</sup> who presented estimates of lifetime effective tax rates for a taxable corporation, a non-corporate business, an individual earning high amounts of labor income, and a large business. In each case, Fleenor and Foster found that the presence of the estate tax raised the lifetime tax rate to a figure above 65 percent. The large business simulation determined a tax rate of 72 percent. Nearly every public finance economist of the last 50 years has concluded that tax rates of this magnitude significantly reduce the taxpayer's willingness to earn more and take entrepreneurial risk. And these two effects -- reductions in labor and in new business formation -- directly depress the rate of general economic growth, which should deeply concern everyone interested in improving economic welfare in the United States.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While Professor McCaffery appears unaware of the Fleenor/Foster study, it includes precisely the kind of evidence he has marshaled to assail the estate tax as inimical to the expansion of economic opportunity. He is not, however, unaware of Richard E. Wagner's important 1993 monograph, <i>Federal Transfer Taxation: A Study in Social Cost,</i> which ties together the many threads of this emerging theoretical canon on estate taxation.<sup>56</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Professor Wagner's study stands virtually alone in presenting macroeconomic estimates of the estate tax's effects on individual decisions to work and save. Using a model that trades labor for capital according to their relative costs and that represents this dynamic interaction through key indicators of macroeconomic activity, Wagner found that the tax premiums created by the estate tax raise the cost of capital sufficiently to reduce national output, employment, and capital stock by measurable amounts. In a simulation that modeled the U.S. economy without the current estate tax, Wagner found that:
<ul>
<p><li>Nominal gross domestic product (GDP) would have been $80 billion higher after eight years than in an economy without the estate tax;

<p><li>228,000 more jobs would have been created;

<p><li>The capital stock would have been $640 billion larger;<sup>57</sup> and

<p><li>The larger economy resulting from the repeal of estate taxes produced increases in all other taxes over the eight-year simulation period, though not quite by an amount equal to the loss of the estate tax.<sup>58</sup>
</ul><p>

<b>THE IMPACT OF REPEALING THE ESTATE TAX</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While analysts have made significant progress in understanding the microeconomic effects of intergenerational taxation, the dearth of studies similar to Wagner's shows that much work still needs to be done on measuring the tax's macroeconomic effects. It is little wonder, however, that such studies are not more numerous. As Stiglitz noted, there are many remaining questions about the tax's effects on wealth accumulation. And without a good knowledge of these effects, economists cannot create that most elementary but crucial of concepts in any tax analysis: the tax base.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Bearing in mind these limitations, the author and Heritage Foundation analysts have estimated the economic impact of repealing the estate and gift tax beginning in 1997. The Heritage analysis made certain assumptions about the effect of repeal. Each of these assumptions was introduced into two leading models of the U.S. economy: the Washington University Macro Model (WUMM) and the Mark 11 macroeconomic model of Wharton Econometric Forecasting Associates.<sup>59</sup>  These two statistical models of U.S. economic activity are highly regarded, exceptionally accurate tools for estimating the effects of public policy changes on the general economy and are widely used for this purpose by America's leading corporations and government agencies.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Given the substantial doubt that annual estate tax filings fully reflect the size of the tax base,<sup>60</sup> estimates of the tax's economic effects must start from another foundation. The macroeconomic estimates presented here were built from estimates of changes in the U.S. labor force and domestic capital stocks associated with removing the estate tax portion of the after-tax cost of labor and capital. These estimates then were introduced into the macroeconomic models to compute the effects.

<p>
<b>Cost of Capital Assumptions</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 
The cost of capital (the so-called rental price of investment) results from at least three factors: 1) the cost of attracting investors to supply capital funds and not do something else with their money, 2) the ratio of a capital good's depreciation relative to the value of output it produces, and 3) taxes. If a business or a household borrows money, it must pay the lender or investor enough to attract that lender or investor away from other opportunities. A portion of this "opportunity cost" payment is the tax that the lender expects to owe on the loan's earnings. Under current law, a business may offset some of this tax premium by deducting its annual depreciation and interest payments. In some cases, businesses also may claim various investment tax credits that further reduce the tax premiums they have had to pay to lenders. However, a substantial portion of the cost of operating a business is not tax deductible, and this results in a positive, residual tax premium in real-world capital costs.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Of course, taxes on ordinary income constitute a substantial percentage of the tax premium in the cost of capital. Every investor attempts to earn the highest possible return on every investment so that his earnings cover the income taxes the investment incurs. The estate tax, however, also is a part of this premium. Just as households are the source of all investment funds, they also are the source of all estate taxes. When individuals begin to see that their income and investment efforts will produce a future taxable estate, they generally do two things: see a financial advisor or estate planner, and increase their earnings requirements to build the funds needed to pay the wealth transfer taxes.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Using data associating incomes with tax liabilities and holdings of corporate paper and equities, Heritage analysts estimated that the present value of future estate tax liabilities for the class of households that holds most corporate debt is slightly more than 3 percent of the average yield on corporate bonds. Thus, if corporate bonds currently yield 10 percent, eliminating wealth transfer taxes would reduce the required yield to 9.7 percent. This estimate of the estate tax component of the tax premium was used to adjust projected corporate bond yields over the period 1997 through 2005.

<p>
<b>Labor Effect Assumptions</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Economists also argue that high taxes reduce the supply of labor. At a certain point, when faced with rising taxes, workers decide to consume more leisure and produce less labor. Wealth transfer taxes are widely assumed to produce this effect, particularly among a class of individuals who clearly perceive the adverse tax consequences of working harder and building greater taxable net worth.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To capture this effect of estate taxes and introduce it into the U.S. macroeconomic model, Heritage analysts estimated the number of wage or salaried workers and self-employed individuals in this same class of households that hold most of America's corporate debt. Eliminating the estate tax would be equivalent to increasing after-tax lifetime earnings by the average effective estate tax rate, or by 18 percent. This percentage, of course, is the minimum amount of earnings change that estate tax repeal would cause: A significant but unknown amount of time and income now is devoted to positioning assets and paying accountants in order to avoid significant estate tax liabilities. This estimate also fails to capture the substantial costs borne by taxpayers and relatives when businesses fail because of estate tax liabilities. In any event, multiplying a standard labor supply elasticity of 0.3 percent by this percentage reduction in taxes, and then multiplying this product times the 18 million individuals in this class of households, yields a labor supply effect of 97,200. This number was used to adjust upwards all estimates of the civilian labor force for the period 1997 through 2005.
<p>
<b>Budget Assumptions</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Besides introducing new labor force and capital cost settings into the macroeconomic model, Heritage also made two adjustments in the federal government's budget for the period 1997 through 2005. First, the total amount of federal revenues was reduced by the forecasted amount of the estate tax. Second, expenditures for non-defense purchases were reduced by an amount exactly equal to the "lost" estate tax revenue. Thus, repealing the estate tax is assumed to be offset by spending reductions, so there is no net contribution to the deficit because of lost estate tax revenue.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

It is highly likely that eliminating the estate tax would result in slightly greater federal income tax receipts. Without an estate tax, taxpayers would make fewer gift transfers to their children, who commonly pay income taxes at rates lower than their parents. However, estimating the size of this effect on income tax revenues involves overcoming a host of problems raised by incomplete estate tax data. The IRS simply is unwilling to disclose important details on intergenerational giving. Thus, the following analysis does not contain estimates of the positive effects of estate tax repeal on income tax receipts. If we had made these estimates, the macroeconomic effects of repeal would have been even more positive.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

By adapting the macroeconomic models in the manner described above, the resulting estate tax simulation measures the economic effects of repealing this tax on December 31, 1996. That is, it shows how differently the economy would have behaved had taxpayers not faced the prospect of estate taxes beginning in 1997. This simulated economy is compared to a "baseline" economy in which the current estate tax is still present. The differences between the baseline and simulated economies are the dynamic impacts of estate tax repeal. Again, these estimates should be viewed as a minimum assessment of the tax's economic effects.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Table 2 indicates that a stronger economy would result from the repeal of wealth transfer taxes.
<ul><p><li>
The most general measurement of economic health (GDP adjusted for inflation) quickly jumps above baseline by as much as 0.4 percent in the Heritage analysis using the WUMM. The increase in real GDP averages $11.2 billion per year over the nine-year period between 1997 and 2005. Figure 3 shows the effects on GDP caused by estate tax repeal. When the Heritage assumptions are fed into the WEFA model, the economy grows above baseline by an average of $2.83 billion over this period.<sup>61</sup>
<p><li>
Behind the growth in GDP is a strong increase in investment. A drop in the cost of capital caused by estate tax repeal leads to increased business purchases of buildings and machines. Investment in the goods that make labor more productive grows 2 percent faster between 1997 and 2005 than it otherwise would. Using the WEFA model, investment grows 0.9 percent faster over this same time period. Economists widely believe that growth in capital goods is closely related to economic growth, and that this helps explain the higher growth in GDP.
<p><li>
In addition to stimulating the growth of private investment, repealing the estate tax reduces the tax costs that workers face. Lower taxes on income are widely believed to result in a larger labor force. The Heritage estate tax simulation results in a significant growth in non-farm private employment, whichever model is used. Total non-farm employment grows by an average of 145,000 above baseline during the nine-year period using the WUMM. This growth subsides in subsequent years as wages rise to reflect the greater productivity of labor caused by the greater amount of capital per laborer. By 2003, total non-farm employment has returned to its long-term growth trend. The Heritage analysis using the WEFA model estimates average employment growth to be 86,000 over this period.
<p><li>
Not only do businesses take advantage of lower capital costs to buy new plant and equipment, but families increase their purchases of new homes. Housing starts jump sharply during the first two years after repeal. The Heritage simulation using the WUMM model predicts that estate tax repeal would lead to a first-year increase of 49,000 in housing starts. This effect is caused by a significant drop in the mortgage interest rate. The fact that it does not drop more in subsequent years explains why housing starts return to baseline after the third year following repeal.
<p><li>
The boost in housing and the growth in business investment expenditures reflect the lower capital costs that result from removing the estate tax premium on capital. The cost of corporate capital and the secondary mortgage rate fall by an average of 21 and 27 basis points, respectively, in the Heritage analysis using the WUMM. While this decline is less dramatic in the WEFA model, the user cost of capital remains solidly below baseline throughout the nine-year period. As economic activity builds following repeal of the estate tax, demand for capital rises, leading to small increases in both the long bond rate and the federal funds rate. Subtle elevations in these market lending rates would be the expected result in an economy that is adding more jobs and creating more capital goods than an economy still burdened by high tax rates.
<p><li>
The growth in household income also supports the increase in housing starts. Between 1997 and 2005, inflation-adjusted household disposable income (broadly, what is left after taxes) grows by an average of $12 billion per year in the Heritage analysis using the WUMM model. Similar growth also occurs in total personal income, which increases by an average of $8 billion per year. Both of these income indicators rise because of higher levels of employment, greater worker productivity, and stronger household and business consumption. The WEFA model shows inflation-adjusted disposable income rising by an average of $9 billion per year and personal income growing by an average of $5 billion per year over this nine-year period.
<p><li>
Despite the loss of $15 billion in annual revenue and $15 billion less in government spending, the federal deficit does not worsen over this nine-year period. In fact, the WUMM simulation shows that a stronger economy leads to deficit improvement. For each of the first seven years in the estate tax simulation, the deficit is slightly less after estate tax repeal than in an economy with an estate tax. During the last two years of the simulation, higher interest rates cause a gentle rise in federal expenditures. Te WEFA simulation indicates minor deficit changes throughout the nine-year period. Both simulations, however, point to the same conclusion: The economic benefits from estate tax repeal should not be sacrificed because of concerns about a federal deficit.
</ul><p><b>
CONCLUSION</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

It is easy in this season of big tax reform proposals to overlook the federal estate tax. This tax, after all, is a relatively minor source of federal revenue that has been declining for the past 20 years. Indeed, many of those involved in the ongoing tax policy debate simply ignore it.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This is a mistake. As this study has shown, the economic cost of the estate tax is many times greater than the revenue it produces, and its reach into American households extends far beyond those few which pay it. Every day, social and economic decisions are made with the estate tax in mind. Minority businesspeople suffer anxious moments wondering whether the savings they have built in their businesses, and that they plan to hand to their children, will be destroyed by the estate tax bill. Poor people, for whom the estate tax has no immediacy, wonder at the scarcity of entry-level jobs or the absence of low-cost educational loans. Factories drone on with worn-out equipment that would be replaced if capital costs fell. Women who have raised their children struggle to find ways to re-enter the work force without upsetting the family's estate tax avoidance plan. Rich people buy vacations in Vail and fine art in Lisbon, rather than new businesses that create jobs and incomes, because the government has a claim on more than half of everything they cannot spend.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The estate and gift tax does much to perpetuate the social and economic distortions produced generally by taxes on income. Should Congress repeal this tax, however, the result would be a growing economy, more abundant jobs, and offices and factories with the kind of new equipment that elevates productivity and supports higher wages. Lower capital costs also would mean new small businesses, which traditionally have served as economic havens for minority families and launching pads for young workers. By repealing the estate and gift tax, Congress would be making significant progress toward creating a tax policy that complements rather than undermines other efforts to expand economic opportunity by creating a growing economy.

    There is little foundation for a claim that the U.S. government levied taxes on incomes in 1914 because it needed additional revenues. Federal budget surpluses in 1911 and 1912 led to a reduction in total federal debt in 1913 and 1914, and these latter two years had very small deficits of about $400,000 each.

    However, the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 (DFRA) extended until 1988 a 55 percent top tax rate that had been scheduled to fall to 50 percent in 1985. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 introduced a tougher penalty on generation-skipping wealth transfers by taxing all such transfers at the top marginal rate of 55 percent. And the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 further forestalled the fall in the top tax rate until the end of 1992.

<p><li>
    "Fair market value" apparently means the value of an asset that a fully informed buyer would pay in a market for the asset. The concept implies the existence of a willing seller and able buyer, which is rarely the case when an estate is valued for tax purposes. Thus, executors must rely on various proxy prices for an estate's assets, such as recent closing prices for stocks and bonds and property sales of similar assets that are contemporary with the death of the decedent. The value of "good will" is a particularly vexing problem in estate tax valuation. Due to the numerous artifices that executors and courts must employ to place a value on estates, the resulting "gross estate" frequently bears little relationship to its market value. For example, an estate consisting solely of art that has been held for many years may have little market value if the tastes of the art-buying public have changed dramatically during the holding period.
<p><li>
    While "fair market value" at the time of death is the most common method of quantifying a decedent's death, an executor of an estate paying tax can elect an alternative valuation date that is somewhat earlier or six months after the date of death. This alternative date method applies particularly to estates dominated by bonds or stocks in companies whose value is significantly affected by the death of the decedent. See 26 U.S.C. Secs. 2031(a) and 2032(a).

They have not been endorsed by, and do not necessarily reflect the views of, the owners of these two macroeconomic models.
<p><li>
    From an economic standpoint, a tax's base is composed of some quantifiable behavior that is being affected by the tax. The estate tax base could be viewed as the sum of all those dollars that are managed annually so as to avoid paying the tax, plus those that end up on a tax form.
<p><li>
     Even though these two estimates of additional GDP are different, the two models indicate the same general result: The economy grows more without the estate tax. The outputs of econometric models often differ, even when employing the very same assumptions, because of subtle differences in the theoretical viewpoints upon which the models are constructed. After all, such models are intended to give analysts insight into how changes in specific economic relationships affect the macroeconomy. The differences between the two models used in this study stem largely from WUMM's greater emphasis on the rental price of investment as a driver of economic activity.

<a href="fyi100.gif">Table 1</a>: Estimated Revenue Raised by 4.3 Cent per Gallon Federal Gas Tax, 1996
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress is now considering repealing the 4.3 cent federal tax imposed under the 1993 budget plan championed by the Clinton Administration.  Gasoline prices at service stations across the country have risen sharply over the last few months, raising concerns over the impact of these rising prices on already strained family budgets.  Nationally, since the beginning of the year, gas prices have risen approximately 16 cents.  In California, where prices have risen even more dramatically, gasoline now costs more than $2 a gallon in some areas.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

While recent gas price hikes are an unwelcome added cost to family budgets, they actually are far exceeded by the total gas taxes paid by Americans.  Combined federal and state gas taxes per gallon of gasoline now average 37.7 cents, more than twice the recent short-term spike caused by market conditions.  These taxes raise the cost of driving a car an average of $310 per year.  In response to the growing public concern over prices and the economic impact of the tax burden, Senator Phil Gramm (R-TX) introduced a <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:S.1727:">bill</a> on May 2 which would repeal the 1993 federal fuel tax of 4.3 cents applying to gasoline and diesel.  Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS) also is expected soon to offer a bill that will repeal the gas and diesel tax and possibly may roll back the 4.3 cent tax on jet fuel as well.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Eliminating the 1993 gas tax is a good start.  While gasoline would still be subject to a 14 cent federal tax, as well as substantial state taxes, repealing the 4.3 cent tax would benefit the economy by reducing transportation costs.  It also would help family budgets.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Unlike the rest of the federal gasoline tax, the 4.3 cent levy is not earmarked for transportation costs.  It flows instead into general revenues.  As Senator Dole has said, at least the previous gasoline taxes "helped build highways and bridges, but this tax was just for deficit reduction.  It doesn't do a thing for highways or bridges.... If we repeal this tax, it'll be 4 cents cheaper at the pump.  If we can find an offset, then we should repeal this tax."  Melvin Sherbert, Chairman of the Legislative Committee of the National Service Station Dealers and owner of two service stations himself, confirmed that tax savings would be passed on directly to consumers.  Sherbert testified on May 3 before theSenate Finance Committee that "We would pass the savings on because we are just waiting to lower prices [because] that helps us sell more gas while still making the same profit [per gallon]."<sup>1</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The poor and lower middle class would be the biggest beneficiaries of this repeal.  Susan Perry, Senior Vice President of the American Bus Association, testified on May 3 before the Senate Finance Committee that as the result of higher fuel costs since the imposition of the fuel tax, "there are fewer bus stops [and] the very poor, very elderly and very rural are mostly affected" because they disproportionately ride buses and fuel costs are passed on to passengers.<sup>2</sup>  Moreover, since the fuel tax is a flat 4.3 cents per gallon, it is regressive.  Because three-quarters of those Americans earning less than $10,000 per year commute to work in privately owned autos, a flat tax rate falls disproportionately on these poor as a percent of their income.<sup>3</sup>  Indeed, 1987 Bureau of Labor statistics data show that the poorest 20 percent of Americans devote 8.8 percent of their expenditures to gasoline and motor oil while the wealthiest 20 percent devote only 3.1 percent of their expenditures to gasoline and motor oil.<sup>4</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The benefit to the economy of repealing the fuel tax would be significant.  Carol Hallett, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Air Transport Association of America, testified that the airline "industry estimates that passing on this [4.3 cents per gallon tax] cost results in five million fewer passengers a year [due to higher ticket prices.  This] correlates to a loss of 1 passenger per flight.  This statistic alone is enough to drop many flights into the loss column, and will surely result in airlines cutting back."<sup>5</sup>  And according to the trucking industry, the 4.3 cent tax adds about $600 per truck annually to the cost of operations.<sup>6</sup>  These costs in turn are largely passed on to consumers in the form of higher priced products.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The burden of this tax for 1996 is $5.3 billion for gasoline alone and $7.4 billion total, based on Department of Energy daily use estimates.<sup>7</sup>  Too often ignored, however, is the regional and state disparity in the impact of this tax.  To assess the state-by-state impact of the 4.3 cent tax on motor, distillate, and jet fuel, we calculated the tax for each state based on Department of Energy state summaries of usage patterns for 1993, the most recent year for which complete data are available.<sup>8</sup>  While the pattern among states may have changed slightly between 1993 and today, the estimates of the tax burden in general would be higher than our state-by-state figures because of increases in consumption.<sup>9</sup>  According to this calculation, the drain on California alone is $772 million based on 1993 usage, while New York and Pennsylvania combined, with about the same number of people, have a cost of $586 million.

This calculation includes only taxable motor fuel, jet fuel, and distillable fuel used for highway-use diesel trucks and automobiles.  Distillate fuel is a general classification for a type of petroleum fuel used mainly for space heating, on - and off-highway diesel fuel, and electric power generation.

April 8, 1996<br>
<p>
<b>WALTER WILLIAMS:</b> I'm going to talk about the morality of taxation and, of course, the flat tax. While we're talking about taxation, I am going to spend most of my time raising some moral issues involved with taxation in general. Whether we like to think of it as such, our fiscal problems, as well as many other problems in our country, are rooted in immoral government conduct.
<p>

Let me start by referring to the United States Constitution, what I prefer to call the "citizen's rule book."  To say something meaningful about taxation, one must also say something about expenditures, and Article 1, Section 8 of our Constitution is very relevant to today's discussion. Article 1, Section 8 begins by granting Congress authority to lay and collect taxes. In the passages that follow, if you read carefully, Article 1, Section 8 enumerates a broad range of about 19 activities for which Congress can use its taxing authority. These 19 activities, for those of us who have not bothered to read the Constitution lately, include a common defense, the coining of money, and the establishment of post offices and courts, among other things.
<p>
I have not done the numbers on this, but I am guessing that the amount of money necessary for Congress to pay for these constitutionally authorized functions of the federal government would come to no more than $400 billion or so at the most. Obviously, that amount differs significantly from today's expenditure level of $1.6 trillion, and even that $1.6 trillion does not capture the total spending because we have the underground federal government, the so-called off-budget expenditures, as well as government-mandated spending by citizens, such as Americans with Disabilities Act, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and Environmental Protection Agency dictates.
<p>

I do not believe that we can restore government to its proper role in a free society by focusing our energies only on the taxation part of the equation. In saying this, I in no way wish to demean the yeoman-like efforts of all those who have worked to come up with a better method of taxation. But I see much of the debate between the flat tax and the national sales tax or our current tax code as boiling down to a question of which is the best way for government to subjugate its citizens (although this is not a meaningless question, because if we have to accept subjugation, I suppose some forms are better than others).
<p>

The debate over what form of taxation we should have somewhat legitimates the level of government spending; and I have always argued, as a number of colleagues have, that it is spending, not taxation, that is the true measure of the burden of government. You see this by recognizing that there is no necessary reason why government has to tax in the first place. At one extreme, Congress could raise all the resources it needed simply by printing currency, or could borrow and require its citizens and other entities to hold a portion of their holdings in government securities, as is done in some countries. Of course, there would be severe problems associated with either one of these methods of taxation, but the bottom-line point is that government spending, not taxation, is the proper measure of government activity, and that is the major problem that needs to be addressed.
<p>

Throughout most of our nation's history, up to the beginning of the 20th century, the federal government spent no more than 3 or 4 percent of GNP, except during wartime. It did not make much difference what form of taxation supported federal government activity. In fact, excise taxes carried the burden. But even during this interval, and even if we had had today's income tax code, there would not have been much of a problem raising 3 or 4 percent of GNP. Almost any kind of tax system would not have much of a problem raising 3 or 4 percent of GNP. I am sure that if that were still the case, we would not be gathered here today to discuss substituting a flat tax for the current code.
<p>

Some people might ask, and some Congressmen might ask, what forms of congressional spending should be cut so that we would not have to worry about the form of taxation. A French philosopher, Frederic Bastiat, gave us the best guide in a little book called <I>The Law</I>, wherein he suggested a way of identifying legal plunder. Bastiat said -- and you can think about our government while I am reading this quote -- "See if the law takes from some persons what belongs to them and gives it to other persons to whom it does not belong. See if the law benefits one citizen at the expense of another by doing what that citizen himself cannot do without committing a crime."
<p>

Clearly, at least two-thirds of federal spending fits Bastiat's description of legal plunder, what I prefer to call legalized theft. If we eliminated legal plunder from the scope of congressional activity, the form of taxation could easily be a non-issue; that is, getting us back to 3 or 4 percent of the GNP. Some may wish to quarrel with my description of Congress's business as being that of legal plunder, but just ask yourself: How does Congress get the money for farm subsidy programs, the savings and loan bailout, food stamps, and the like?  Clearly, it uses intimidation, threats, and coercion to take what rightfully belongs to one citizen and give it to another to whom it does not belong.
<p>

If you think I'm being too loose with terminology about intimidation, threats, and coercion, think about April 15. The mission of virtually every Cabinet department in this city is to distribute the loot that Congress collects. There is neither moral nor constitutional authority for Congress to commit plunder. That is the moral issue that we need to address.
<p>

Turning to the Armey-Shelby flat tax proposal, notwithstanding what I have argued so far, there are some benefits to its enactment. First, it would reduce Congress's ability to grant one group of Americans special tax privileges that are denied to another group of Americans. The House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee are two of the most powerful committees in Congress. Their members have the largest political war chest, and the reason is that they are the focus of Washington's lobbying groups, who pay handsomely and work diligently to have favors bestowed upon them. The Armey-Shelby flat tax plan would go a long way toward eliminating privilege-granting by the United States Congress, and that may explain some of the political resistance to having a flat tax.
<p>

Another benefit of the Armey-Shelby flat tax is lower compliance costs. According to various estimates, the compliance costs of our current code include the 5.5 billion to 6 billion hours Americans spend on such activity as recordkeeping, filling out tax forms, going to court, and seeking ways to avoid taxes. The Armey-Shelby flat tax would create a GNP windfall because if Americans were spending those tax compliance hours in productive activity, the country would be considerably richer. Current tax compliance costs are estimated to be equal to the entire annual output of the automobile and truck and aircraft industries combined.
<p>

As evidenced by my remarks, I am a purist -- what the news media, and maybe even some of you, might call an extremist. But I am not such a purist that I cannot see that a flat tax is a major improvement over the status quo.
<p>

If a flat tax is enacted, however, there should be an additional paragraph in the law requiring a supermajority, say four-fifths, to raise it and a simple majority to decrease it. Like the Framers of our Constitution, I do not trust the Congress of the United States. With the current complex tax code, there are numerous legal ways to hide our money from the revenuers. With a simple flat tax, those hideaways would be eliminated. Then, if Congress raised taxes, we would be up that proverbial creek without a paddle.
<p>

<b>J. KENNETH BLACKWELL:</b> <I>The New York Times</I>, in a 1909 editorial opposing the very first income tax, predicted that when men get in the habit of helping themselves to the property of others, they cannot easily be cured of it. The history of our tax code, in economic terms, mirrors the course of most addictions: first, advancing dependence; second, diminished returns; and third, deteriorating health of the afflicted. <p>

The 1.9 percent rate of economic growth experienced by the U.S. economy is not an accident. It is caused in large measure by a tax code that is impossibly complex, overly intrusive, manifestly unfair, and economically destructive. While some people oppose tax increases or favor tax reductions simply because they want to maintain or enhance their disposable income, I favor constraining government taxation because of the negative impact it has on economic growth.
<p>

Higher taxes mean lower rates of growth in income and jobs over time. This has been amply demonstrated in dozens of scholarly studies. Perhaps the most exhaustive recent study was performed by Dr. Richard Vedder of Ohio University for the Joint Economic Committee of Congress. Looking at the tax history and economic performance of 50 American states for the period 1960 to 1993, Professor Vedder concluded that relatively low-tax states grew nearly one-third faster than high-tax states.
<p>

Income taxes have a particularly adverse impact on income growth. Flat rate income taxes are significantly more favorable to economic growth than progressive taxes. Perhaps income in flat rate income tax states grew about 25 percent faster than did personal income in states with progressive tax structures. Professor Vedder lists over 50 other studies that similarly conclude that taxes adversely impact economic performance, whether measured by income growth, job creation, new business startups, or population change. These studies look at areas within the U.S. during a given period of time or, in many cases, at other countries. <p>


For example, one study of 107 nations by researchers at the National Bureau of Economic Research concluded, "We find that a balanced budget increase in government spending and taxation is predicted to reduce output growth rates."  Given that, it is desirable to provide a legal framework for fiscal policymaking in Washington that removes the bias that exists in the current system in favor of relatively large government and, thus, high taxation. Special-interest groups can and do use their concentrated financial and political power to overcome the general interest on a continuous basis, leading to spending in excess of desirable levels, as Walter has just demonstrated. By making it more difficult to tax the populace, we can reduce the fiscal drag on our long-term economic performance that high federal taxation imposes. This is a strong argument for a supermajority requirement for legislative approval of tax increases.
<p>

The current federal tax system provides perverse economic incentives to states and local governments. Because state and local income tax payments are deductible against federal adjusted income, state governments are encouraged to levy income rather than other forms of taxes or no taxes at all. Consider two otherwise identical families, both making $75,000 in income, one living in New York and the other living in Texas or Florida. The New York family probably pays $4,000 or more in state and local income taxes, while the Florida or Texas counterpart pays nothing. Because of federal tax deductibility, the New York family probably will pay close to $1,000 less in federal income taxes.
<p>

This is terribly unfair. It violates the concept of horizontal equity, a concept that says that people of similar economic circumstances should pay similar taxes. Beyond that, however, the federal government is subsidizing the citizens of states that engage in very high-tax policies, shown by Professor Vedder and many others to be so destructive of economic growth. The elimination or reduction of that federal deductibility, such as would occur with a pure flat tax, would increase pressures on high-tax states to reduce their income taxes, which would spur economic growth, something that most states in this union desperately need and desire. This, in addition to the economic stimulus that would come from lowering the federal marginal income tax rates, would be a tremendous boon to our nation's economy.
<p>

Moreover, the move to a lower, flat rate federal income tax fits with another theme that virtually everyone in both political parties is supporting, at least rhetorically: the devolution of power back to the states. The current tax code says, in effect, that Washington knows best. States that have high income taxes are considered good, progressive jurisdictions, so Washington rewards their citizens with lower taxes. States that raise revenues more by sales taxes, excise taxes, or user fees are punished relative to states that use high income or property levies. Rather than being neutral on state fiscal policy, Washington is trying to use financial incentives to dictate the nature of taxation.
<p>

What is particularly perverse about this is that the form of taxation Washington is trying to dictate has a particularly adverse impact on growth. Washington is telling the states to tax the production of goods, or the resources used to produce goods, rather than the consumption of income. That is economically wrong; it is inconsistent with empowering states and local governments to do what they feel is best for their citizens. We have an opportunity in this public policy-defining year to set the record straight: to junk the present tax code and replace it with a tax code that positions us for the 21st century.
<p>

When I was 14, I thought I was God's gift to amateur boxing. I won my first four bouts with relative ease. The fifth bout, I got hit so hard in the nose that I had to go home and tell my father that I was going to find a more scholarly career to pursue. I stayed away from the boxing arena until I was a freshman at Xavier University, where Father E. J. O'Connor, a 72-year-old Jesuit, would ask me and a friend of mine, Benji, if we would go to the amateur bouts with him at the old Cincinnati Gardens. We went out and watched 10 bouts. The 11th bout, a young boy from the western side of Cincinnati, also of Irish-Catholic heritage, came out and, before his fight, made the sign of the cross. Benji leaned over and said, "Father, what's the significance of that?"  Father said, "Tiger, it ain't enough if you can't fight."
<p>

I would suggest to you that it is time for us, as the revolutionaries at the grass roots, to move beyond lip service and get into action, put some muscle behind our rhetoric, and make sure that the Congress of the United States creates a tax code and a tax structure that spur economic growth, create jobs, and promote hope and opportunity.
<p>

<b>JOHN FUND:</b> Two dates are very significant to Americans every spring. One, of course, is April 15, when Americans have to wade through all of their tax forms and fill them out. The other one is May 6, which is Tax Freedom Day. That is the day when the average American family will have earned enough to pay its federal, state, and local taxes and begin keeping money for food, clothing, shelter, and all of the things that keep body and soul together.
<p>

The two dates are linked because we have the tax system that we have, because it is overly complex, and because it raises far too much money. Right now, only 29 percent of Americans fill out the tax form that requires itemization; 52 percent of Americans actually have to go and pay someone, a professional, to fill out those forms for them. If you fill out the form 1040, 66 percent of Americans have to pay a professional. There is something wrong with a tax system which requires people to get somebody with an accountant's training to fill out a tax form for them.
<p>

If you go further and look at its intrusiveness, the IRS employs 111,000 people. That is more people than work for the FBI; that is more people than work for the Border Patrol; that is more people than work for the Drug Enforcement Administration, the CIA, and the National Security Agency all combined. It is an enormous apparatus. It is said that perhaps the least believable thing you can say in this country is "I'm from the government, and I'm here to help you."  Well, perhaps the most believable thing someone can say in this country is "I'm from the IRS, and I'm here to hurt you."
<p>

Everyone across both political parties recognizes that this system is broken, cannot be fixed, and is irredeemable. House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt put it, I think, better than anyone: The tax system has become a test of legal brainpower and the ability of accountants to conduct a treasure hunt for hidden deductions and tax breaks. Our tax code has become a dense fog of incentives, inducements, and penalties that distort the most basic economic decisions, constrain the free market, and make it hard for Americans to run their own lives.
<p>

The IRS has become the very symbol of what is wrong with the American government. In order to clean it up, proposals are laid on the table like the flat tax. The flat tax is a way to shrink the IRS from the monolithic and intractable bureau it is today to a simple clearinghouse of information.
<p>

The flat tax as a concept, of course, is enormously popular. The flat tax was attacked mercilessly by almost every candidate in the Republican Party because it was the proposal by Steve Forbes that was most identified with his candidacy. In order to attack Steve Forbes and slow his momentum, you had to attack the flat tax. But the exit polls which were taken as Republican primary voters left the polling booth found that in 18 out of 22 primary states, the flat tax was still supported by a majority or plurality of people voting in those primaries. It received the equivalent of a political mugging, but it is still standing and walking around.
<p>

There are a lot of people who say the flat tax is a far distant goal. Well, not if you look in contemporary political terms. The flat tax was introduced to the American people on the editorial page of <I>The Wall Street Journal</I> on March 25, 1981, just over 15 years ago, in a famous essay by Bob Hall and Alvin Rabushka called "The Attraction of a Flat Rate System."  It has picked up adherents ever since. There are now two books on the bestseller list that discuss the flat tax, one by House Majority Leader Dick Armey. It is gathering momentum.
<p>

It is not surprising that it has taken us 15 years to get this far. I think Mr. Blackwell mentioned the first income tax. That was not really the first income tax; that was the first income tax that actually stuck. The first income tax was a peacetime income tax that came about in 1894. It was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, which said that you had to have a constitutional amendment to have such a tax. That effort took from 1894 to 1913, when we passed the Sixteenth Amendment -- 19 years; that is about how long it takes an idea that has irresistible political support behind it to come to realization in America. So I'm not surprised it has taken us 15 years to get this far. At the same time, I also would not be surprised if it takes us only four or five more years to achieve something like the flat tax, because this system is broken and is reaching a critical state of collapse.
<p>

There is another proposal on the table which I think is as significant as the flat tax, and which will be voted on in the House of Representatives on April 15. It has been referred to as the supermajority for raising taxes. This would mean that, as 10 or 11 states now do, you would require two-thirds of the House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate to pass a general tax increase. This is an insurance policy to make certain that, once again, the Constitution will have shape and form and will carry with it the force of law. As it is right now, the Constitution has been interpreted virtually into nothingness, as I think Walter Williams indicates.
<p>

We need something more dramatic than what the Founding Fathers envisioned. We need the supermajority, the two-thirds, to raise taxes. Couple that with a simple flat rate system and I think you will have a powerful engine for economic growth, a powerful engine for simplifying people's lives, and a powerful blow for civil liberties in this country. If we achieve either or both of these goals, the supermajority or the flat tax, I think there will come a day when the American people can say that April 15, more or less, is just like any other day -- and wouldn't that be a blessed relief?
<p>

<b>STEVE FORBES:</b> It is good to be here today, to see the flat tax discussed in an environment where you are seeking after truth rather than sound bites.
 I hope it is a theme that others will be picking up in the fall.

Everything we proposed in this year's presidential campaign, particularly the flat tax, had as its purpose -- it sounds like a clich, but it's the truth -- to help realize the American dream, which in its essence allows all of us the chance to discover and develop to the fullest our God-given talents. Anything that stands in the way of that, we resisted. Anything that promotes it, we supported. The flat tax is the first of many critical issues that came out of the campaign that will make it possible for America to realize its full potential -- as a people and as a nation.
<p>

One of the things that pundits occasionally do, and historians will do forever, is discuss why Americans were in a sour mood in the 1990s. After all, the standard of living, by any objective measure, is a bit higher than it was in the 1970s or even parts of the 1980s; we did win the 40-year Cold War; we are living longer; the world is looking to the U.S. for leadership. So why are we in a sour mood?
<p>

The answer is simple: We are not fulfilling our potential as a people and as a nation. One of the dangers of this era is that it will be known as the era of missed opportunities. Never in history, and certainly in the 20th century for this country, has a nation had a chance to do more things of a positive nature at home and to be an example of good overseas. Even in 1914, before the first World War, we were simply one of a number of powers in the world. People did look to us, but they looked to other nations and empires as well.
<p>

When the 20th century began, people felt that in spite of all of the problems in the world, this would be an age of material abundance. The rule of law would advance. Even autocratic Russia was beginning to lumber -- haltingly, fitfully, but in the right direction -- toward a constitutional monarchy. Then came the First World War. The devastation of that seemingly senseless loss of life undermined, in the minds of many, the foundations of Western civilization. The rise of communism in Russia, fascism in Italy, and Nazism in Germany following the First World War helped plant the seeds of the Great Depression and, of course, the Second World War. Now, with the Cold War over, we once again have a chance, at least in spirit, to go back to the optimism that began this century.
<p>

In America today is this mindset that we can't grow economically more than 2 percent or 2.5 percent, which is absolutely preposterous. Overseas, countries are looking to us. They want to know: How do we make the transition to a free-market economy?  How do we make it possible for liberty to sink real roots and not be uprooted as happened in the aftermath of World War I?
<p>

We should keep in mind, for example, that in the 1920s and early 1930s democracy was the prevalent form of government in much of the world. Yet, without external aggression, simply because of internal weakness and because the world did not create an environment to make it possible for democracy to sink real roots, democracy in Europe collapsed almost everywhere -- Central Europe, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia, Poland, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Greece, Turkey, and Italy. Everywhere you looked, most ominously in Germany and then in Asia because of Japan, democracy quickly collapsed.
<p>

Today we have an opportunity, not for a New World Order where we have direction from above, but to liberate the imagination and energies of people around the world. They are looking for guidance on how to do it, and we have so far failed abysmally in being an example of good -- not only at home but also overseas.
<p>

So the flat tax is a means to an end. This is something that I think our brethren on Capitol Hill have to get used to: that when they explain the issues, such as balancing the budget, they must never forget that the balanced budget is not simply a goal unto itself. It is a means to an end. Otherwise, we sound like accountants looking at numbers as numbers and not as representing real people dealing with real-life problems. That is why the Republicans lost the moral high ground last fall in the confrontation with the White House, and now we have to get that moral high ground back again.
<p>

The flat tax is the first means to revitalizing the American dream. It is no secret to most of you in this room that the tax code today is a monstrous deadweight on American life. It is the principal reason why two incomes in the family can't do the job that one income did in previous generations. As many of you know, a typical family today pays eight times as much in federal income tax on each dollar of income as a typical family did 40 years ago.
<p>

You see the effects of this deadweight in our slow-growth economy. It's not just because the Federal Reserve believes in the crazy Phillips curve that we can't grow more than 2.5 percent without triggering inflation. It is because taxes are not only a means of collecting revenue; taxes are also a price we pay: A tax on income, a tax on profit, a tax on capital gains is a price we pay for working; a price we pay for being innovative, imaginative, and successful. And as we know, when the price of those good things is too high, we are going to get less of them; when the price is lower, we get more of them.
<p>

Yet that seemingly simple insight is lost in policymaking circles in this town. When the Republicans took control of Congress a little over a year ago, they had a chance to get a dynamic model in place in the Congressional Budget Office, but instead they let the opportunity pass by. I remember before I got into the race, when I was with Empower America, I asked one of my opponents, "Why aren't you going for some form of dynamic model?"  "Well, Steve," he said in a tone that only a professor could adopt with a wayward student, "if we keep this old model, that means in order to get tax cuts, we're gonna have to cut spending even more."  He didn't realize that without a dynamic model, you'll get the tax cuts, but at the end of the day you won't get the spending changes as well.
<p>

What the Republicans must remember -- if they ever knew it -- is that if you are going to get long-term changes in Washington, if you're ever going to get serious cuts in spending, serious downsizing and reorganization of government, you must have an environment where fear is not prevalent, where people see that their lives are dramatically improving, that opportunities are there. Then voters will give you the political capital if you wish to use that capital to make those difficult long-term changes. That simple insight is seemingly lost in too many quarters of our party: You will not get economic growth unless you get rid of these high tax rates, and the most effective, dramatic way to get rid of them is with the flat tax.
<p>

But the tax code is also the principal source of power in Washington. For a couple of generations now the favorite activity has been trading loopholes, trading favors for political support and contributions. All you have to do is look at those graphs in Dan Mitchell's book to see what members of tax-writing committees get in contributions versus what their brethren on other committees in Congress get.<sup>1</sup>  The same thing is true of the state legislatures. The current tax code is the principal source of political pollution and corruption in Washington.
<p>

Today, as we all know, even the tax collector doesn't understand what's in the tax code. Half the time, if you call the IRS, even the IRS doesn't know what's in there; but if you take the IRS's advice and it's wrong, you're held responsible for it.
<p>

I liked to point out in my campaign that the Gettysburg Address is a little over 200 words; the American Declaration of Independence, 1,300 words; the Holy Bible, 773,000 words: the federal income tax code, 7 million words and rising. That puts the tax code in perspective. There's no way to "ER" this thing. You can't reform it. You really can't cut around the edges. The only thing you can do with this monstrosity is to scrap it, drive a stake through it, bury it, and hope it never rises again to terrorize the American taxpayer. There is no other way.
<p>

Let me briefly outline what my flat tax plan is. One of the most astonishing things that came out of this campaign was what people thought my plan was or what it was reported to be -- not what it actually was. <p>


The great virtue of the flat tax, in addition to its simplicity, is that it has generous exemptions for adults and children. An adult, for example, would get a $13,000 tax deduction; each child, $5,000. Also, the flat tax is a tax cut; I'll state that up front. When you're on the campaign trail, reporters expect you to say this isn't revenue neutral. No, my plan is not revenue neutral. And they ask with horror, "Why isn't it revenue neutral?"
<p>

"Revenue neutral" gets to the heart of the problem: the attitude that the nation exists to feed the appetite of Washington. What I tried to make clear on the campaign trail was that there are occasions when Washington should have to adjust to the needs of the nation, and under my flat tax plan, it would do just that. With generous exemptions -- $13,000 for an adult, $5,000 for each child -- for the first time since withholding was invented in 1942, millions of Americans would be removed from the federal income tax rolls.
<p>

With those exemptions, for example, a couple would pay no tax on their first $26,000 of income. For a family of four with two kids, it would be the first $36,000. With three kids, it would be $41,000. There are not many families of four in America, outside of a few major centers, that would have $36,000 of tax deductions under the current system. So the flat tax would remove millions of people.
<p>

Any income above those exemptions would be taxed at a simple flat rate of 17 percent. There would be no tax on the personal level -- on your pension, Social Security, personal savings, capital gains, or inheritance. For business, it would be equally simple. Obviously, the transition issues are much more complicated; it would take several years to phase in, especially on the business side. But once it was phased in, you would have a 17 percent rate on the net, and then investments would be written off, expensed in year one: no more ever-changing, complicated depreciation schedules. It makes no sense in this high-tech, information, micro-chip age for Congress, the IRS, the tax courts, or the government as a whole to dictate to entrepreneurs and executives the life of an asset -- to put an arbitrary life on an asset. That should be a business decision, not the government's.
<p>

That is, in essence, the flat tax, or my version of it. The good points of it I thought were self-evident. With that 17 percent rate, we'd get a true boom in the economy -- one that would dwarf even that of the early 1960s when we had growth rates that people today would say are impossible to achieve. In the early 1960s through the mid-1960s up to the Vietnam War, the economy grew almost 5 percent in real terms. That is the kind of growth rate, given the fundamentals of America today, that I think we can achieve again, not forever, but for several years as we begin to bring our new technologies on-line.
<p>

The flat tax is also a fair system because if you make more, you pay more. It is also postcard simple, which was, I thought, a very attractive feature. It is also honest; it rips away the principal source of political pollution and corruption in the nation's capital; and if we can do that in D.C., I guarantee you, you'll quickly do it in most of the 50 states.
<p>

What, then, were the arguments against something that would do so much good for America?  I hate to repeat them here, because many of you know that they are not really valid, but we will be hit with these arguments as this debate heats up.
<p>

First, critics said the flat tax would hurt or clobber housing. Only in Washington would people believe that a pro-growth overhaul of the tax code would somehow be a disaster for housing. After all, you get to keep more of what you earn, you don't have your personal savings taxed, so it's easier to put together a downpayment for a house. Even the Clinton Treasury Department acknowledges that the flat tax would mean lower interest rates, which would translate into lower mortgage rates. And realtors know that the principal determinant of a person's or couple's buying a house is the monthly payment. That is the key factor, and with lower interest rates you would have even lower monthly payments.
<p>

Put these three factors together -- more money in the pocket (not to mention the opportunity for better-paying jobs in the future), an easier-to-put-together downpayment, and lower monthly mortgage payments. How is that a disaster for housing?  No one ever explained it to me, certainly not the realtors. The bogus study they drew on came from one of Forbes magazine's competitors. I will admit I have a vested interest in downgrading DRI/McGraw-Hill, but, in the study they assumed a flat tax rate of 22 percent to 25 percent, not the 17 percent I was talking about.
<p>

Critics said it would be bad for charities. The blunt fact of the matter is that in America, when people have more, they give more. With a flat tax, we'd have more and would be persuaded to give more. The United States is known as a charitable, generous nation; Alexis de Tocqueville talked about it 160 years ago, long before we had a federal income tax.
<p>

Nay-sayers said it would be bad for municipal bond holders because other forms of debt would not be taxed directly to individuals and this would be bad for municipal bonds. No, it would not hurt the price of municipal bonds. When the general level of interest rates goes down, it does not hurt the principle value of municipal bonds.
<p>

What it would mean -- and this is what the issuers of municipal bonds hated -- is more accountability. You know and I know that when you buy a munibond, the only thing you want to know about is does it have a good rating, does it have insurance. Then you buy it. You don't look very hard at what's behind that bond. Well, the issuers of munibonds would not have that advantage anymore, and those products would get the same kind of examination that other forms of debt get -- not a bad thing in terms of political accountability. But in terms of hurting the principle value of the bonds, it wouldn't. If anything, once the flat tax was in place, the price of municipal bonds would probably go up a little bit. What's wrong with that?
<p>

Then the carpers said it would hurt the middle class. Somebody just showed me an item from Sunday's <I>Washington Times.</I> Dick Gephardt is flogging that crazy notion again. He says Dick Armey's plan, which is not much different from mine, will hurt the middle class, raise its taxes several thousand dollars. You know how they can make that statement?  They assume that it will be a flat 17 percent rate on all your income. No exemptions; they leave out the $36,000 of exemptions (in Armey's case, the first $31,000 or $33,000 of exemptions). They leave that out. So a family of four making $45,000 a year, according to Dick Gephardt, would owe a tax of $7,000. You know what the real tax would be under my variation of the flat tax?  About $1,600. Under Dick Armey's, $2,000. Millions of people would be removed from the tax rolls, but that fact also got lost in the shuffle during the campaign.
<p>

Critics said the flat tax would give advantages to rich people, because investment income would not be taxed. As you know, investment income would be taxed, only it would be taxed at the source, at the corporate level. Now, why it was considered populist to say that businesses should not write the checks to the government, that individuals should write the checks to the government, I have not been able to figure out. To give business the tax break, but not the individual, somehow was seen as liberal. Even Pat Buchanan was talking about lounge lizards in Miami getting these breaks.
<p>

For those of you not familiar with the arguments, let me reassure you: Investment income is taxed, only it's taxed at the business level. Businesses write the checks to the IRS, which means the IRS gets the money sooner. Because it's taxed at the source, it also means you get it more efficiently and faster. 
<p>

It's like withholding on your paycheck. When you get a paycheck, your employer takes out, or withholds, all of your taxes, all your payroll taxes, and you get the remainder. The rest is siphoned off, sent to the IRS. The same thing is true for investment income, only in this case the business withholds the 17 percent and writes the check to the IRS. Whatever the company decides to give its shareholders, the taxes on that amount already have been paid. It's taxed at the source, taxed once, taxed more efficiently.
<p>

During the campaign, this was made to sound as if it were going to be a giveaway to the rich, a disaster that would destroy the middle class. Actually, it would revive the so-called middle class, which, thankfully, in America is not static; its members are changing all the time.
<p>

The final argument has great resonance within my party, the Republican Party: that a flat tax would hurt the deficit. Again, you have to remember that the flat tax is a means to an end, just as deficit reduction is a means to an end. My own view is that the flat tax is the only way we're ever going to get Washington's finances reformed, because only if you have a vibrant, growing economy, as I said earlier, will you have the political capital to make those difficult changes.
<p>

The deficit would be eliminated, even by the way Washington keeps its books -- which is a disaster -- because you would have great growth. I think we could get 5 percent growth for several years. You would have more compliance. Even with the convoluted tax code today, whenever tax rates are reduced, compliance goes up.
<p>

There would be the efficiency factor: We spend, depending on whose numbers you use, $100 billion to $103 billion a year just complying with the tax code. We spend up to 6 billion hours a year just filling out tax forms. Already, at least in quality of life, our lives would improve. We would have a couple of extra billion hours a year for doing other things. You would have that efficiency factor in the economy as well, with people able to do more productive things -- at least more satisfying things -- than coping with tax forms.
<p>

And finally, with lower interest rates, you would pay less on the national debt. Not only would people have lower mortgage payments, but also there would be less owed on the national debt, which would also take some pressure off the federal deficit.
<p>

So whatever the arguments are -- whether it's housing, charities, munibonds, the middle class, deficits, or something else -- there are good answers to them. It was remarkable during the campaign that, despite the drumbeat of criticism, exit polls showed that in the primaries a plurality or majority of the voters were still in favor of the flat tax. That shows that information can get through some very distorted or polluted filters.
<p>

Let me close by quickly touching on how we got this tax monstrosity and what a unique opportunity we have to fundamentally overhaul the tax code. The background is very simple. Today's government is primarily a result of the wars that we had to fight in this century. Warfare is a centralizing force. In order to face the external threat, a country has to mobilize the resources of its society. And, with very few exceptions, for the last 80 years, America has faced a major external threat of one sort or another.
<p>

When the income tax was introduced in 1913, what was the top rate?  Six percent?  When did you hit the first 1 percent bracket?  I think you had to earn the equivalent of today's six-figure income before you became even eligible for the income tax. Yet five to six years later, because of World War I, what was the top rate?   Over 70 percent. After World War I lawmakers said, "We can't reduce these rates because it would hurt the budget deficit."
<p>

Fortunately, in the 1920s we got Republican Presidents, Harding and Coolidge and a Treasury Secretary, all vilified by the history books, who reduced tax rates to a top rate of 25 percent. But we got a piece of economic warfare: The Smoot-Hawley tariff. It and other policies waged trade and currency war against the rest of the world, and that led to the massive tax increases of 1932.
<p>

No sooner did the New Deal wind down than we had the Second World War, which, of course, was a great centralizing event in this nation's history. And along came tax withholding. And no sooner was World War II over than we found ourselves in a 40-year Cold War.
<p>

By the early 1960s, even though John Kennedy was reducing tax rates, it was accepted economic thinking that you needed high tax rates because if you didn't have them, the government could not spend money, and people might save too much. They really thought saving was a problem in the 1930s, and even in the 1950s: If we saved too much, the economy would stagnate. Without high tax rates, people would keep their money and might not invest it, might not spend it. And the economy would stagnate. In other words, if people won't use their money, the government will take it away and spend it for them.
<p>

That part of things was true: The government has spent it, and then some. By the early 1960s -- and this is important to understand -- a lot of people in America believed that if a government could win two World Wars, alleviate the distress of the Great Depression, put a man on the Moon, and be in the forefront of the civil rights movement, it could be used as an instrument to solve all of the nation's other problems, at home and overseas. 
<p>

 We have learned some very painful lessons in the last 30 years. We have learned the limitations of government in real-life experiences. Now, with the end of the Cold War, we don't have a centralizing trend. We have learned that at home, government is no more successful than it has ever been in creating utopias here on Earth. We do have a situation overseas, at least for a while, of relative peace. I say relative peace: This administration seems to be doing its best to revive bad forces in the world. We still have a window of opportunity, though.
<p>

We are in the midst of a technology age that is pro-individual, machines recentralizing events in and of themselves, big cities, big corporations, big unions, big government. Personal computers are almost Jeffersonian in their characteristics -- anti-hierarchy, anti-authoritarian; they let anyone roam around the world at will. You have the new age of the economy; you have the end of the Cold War. This is a good time to make fundamental reforms and get away from the debris that grew from the travesties, the errors, and the tragedies of the 20th century.
<p>

Why, then, is there so much opposition?  Why did it take this campaign for people to begin discussing making changes in Social Security, to push medical savings accounts?  And why is it that something so basic as the flat tax -- whether it's my version, Dick Armey's version, or somebody else's version, the concept is the same -- why is there so much opposition to it?
<p>

I think the reason is a basic one: A flat tax strikes at the heart of the power and culture of Washington, even as much as term limits does. That's why it will be furiously resisted. But public opinion -- if you nurture it, if you get out there and explain the flat tax, come out with books like Dan's or Dick Armey's books, go on the talk shows, do some little agitprops, as they used to say -- it can triumph.
<p>

And if that kind of tax reform triumphs, then all of our other reforms will be able to triumph as well. We're not talking about devolving power from Washington to the state municipalities; we're taking a more direct route, directly back to "We the people."  Whether it's parental control of education, term limits, a new Social Security system for younger people, medical savings accounts, and especially the flat tax, it's giving power back to us. If you allow people to keep more of the resources they create, they create more resources. It's that simple, as another would-be businessman-politician likes to say. It is that simple.
<p>

So the flat tax is more than an economic argument. It's more than a pressure-on-two-income-families argument. It gets to the essence of the wonderful potential and opportunities we have in America today. And if we take positive advantage of these opportunities, then the basic thrust of American civilization -- which is inclusive, glued together by a shared set of ideas and ideals; not by race, religion, or common ancestry, but by people sharing a set of ideas and ideals -- can triumph and revive, not only here but overseas as well.
<p>

Will this be an age of realized opportunities?  From my experience on the campaign trail -- even though I didn't go as far as I would have liked -- the answer is a resounding "yes."  You here today are proof of it, and as more people understand the possibilities, it is going to happen.
<p>

The history of ideas is never a smooth one, as some of the textbooks would suggest, and it is never one of inevitability. We have to make ideas happen; but in this new age, with the new tools available, and with people ripe for this kind of reform, we can make ideas become reality.
<p>

I hope that we can work together and can get others to work with us to make these reforms happen. When we do, this generation will be seen as doing what previous generations of Americans have done: as having faced opportunities, faced challenges, and risen to the occasion so that future generations can build on what we bequeath them.
