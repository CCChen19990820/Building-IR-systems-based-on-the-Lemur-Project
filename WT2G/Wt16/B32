<h3>PUBLIC HEARING TO HIGHLIGHT IMPORTANCE OF TAX
REFORM TO URBAN AREAS</h3>
<blockquote>
<B>Chairman Jack Kemp and Tax Reform Commission members
to hear from inner city entrepreneurs, congressional and policy
experts</B>
</CENTER>

<P>

<B>WASHINGTON, D.C. -</B> Access
to capital, credit and job opportunities in our nation's urban
areas will be among the highlights a public hearing at Howard
University in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday that will feature entrepreneurs,
as well as congressional and policy experts, according to Jack
Kemp, chairman of the National Commission Economic Growth and
Tax Reform.
<P>
&quot;Citizens from several important sectors will
emphasize the importance of tax reform to economic growth, jobs
and ownership in our nation's urban areas,&quot; said Kemp, former
secretary of Housing and Urban Development.
<P>
Among those scheduled as witnesses for the hearing
are: Steve Mariotti, President and CEO, National Foundation for
Teaching Entrepreneurship; Frank Almeda, a participant in the
National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship; Michele Dyson,
President and CEO, CIS, Inc., a high-tech information company
she founded; U.S. Rep. Linda Smith (R-WA), Chair of the Tax and
Finance Subcommittee of the House Small Business Committee; and,
Barbara Franklin, Barbara Franklin Enterprises, former U.S. Commerce
Secretary.
<P>
The hearing is scheduled for Tuesday, September 26,
beginning at 9:00 a.m. at the Blackburn Center, West Ballroom,
Howard University, Georgia Avenue and Howard Place entrance, Washington,
D.C.  It is free and open to the public. 
<P>
By the end of September, the Tax Reform Commission
will have held 12 public meetings in the three months since it
was formed.  The commission is determined to &quot;listen first.&quot;
It is holding this series of public hearings to learn from the
American people their frustrations, fears, and concerns with the
federal income tax system.  More than 100 witnesses, from a cross-section
of American life, have already testified before the Tax Reform
Commission, during hearings in Washington, D.C.; Boston, Massachusetts;
Omaha, Nebraska; Charlotte, North Carolina; Palo Alto, California
(Silicon Valley); South-central Los Angeles; and Harlem in New
York City.
<P>
&quot;We are searching for real ideas, from real
people, for real reform,&quot; said Kemp.  &quot;We have already
found overwhelming dismay and frustration with the current system.
 The federal tax code, with its high marginal rates, and mindboggling
rules and regulations, is choking economic growth in all sectors
of American life.  It is burdensome to minority men and women
who want the seed corn and venture capital necessary to achieve
their part of the American dream.&quot;
<P>
Kemp said that as currently written, the tax code:
<UL>
<LI>Punishes the most dynamic forces for growth in
our economy -- the small business owners and entrepreneurs who
turn bold ideas into new businesses, new jobs, and new products.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Discourages working Americans who are trying
to save for the future and to build a better life for themselves
and their families.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Is endlessly complex and confusing, costing literally
billions of dollars in lost time and effort.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
Senate Leader Bob Dole and House Speaker Newt Gingrich
have charged the 14-member commission with making recommendations
for a tax code that is &quot;flatter, fairer, and simpler&quot;
-- a system that will encourage economic growth and greater opportunity
for all Americans.  
<P>
The commission hopes to present recommendations that
will make the tax code more family friendly and create incentives
for saving and investment. Its aim is to help guide the tax reform
debate toward changes that will reinvigorate entrepreneurship,
risk taking, saving, investment, and work effort. It hopes to
contribute to changes that will make America more competitive
and expand the nation's worldwide leadership in the 21st century
economy. 
<P>
Among the issues it is studying:  What are the implications
to the economy of a steeply progressive tax system? What is the
impact on economic growth of higher marginal tax rates? What do
people mean whey they say they want a &quot;fairer&quot; tax system?
 What do we mean by &quot;flatter&quot; tax rates?  &quot;There
are a lot of different views, and we want to know what the American
people think and what are the ramifications,&quot; Kemp said.
<P>
&quot;We are setting the stage for American tax policy
for the new century.  We hope that this series of hearings will
help all of us to learn more about the changes that are needed
to make better informed decisions about the hard choices that
lie ahead,&quot; Kemp said. &quot;If we can find the core, central
principles of a new vision for tax reform that includes everyone's
views, we can get this done. The American people -- and our children
and grandchildren-- will be the winners.&quot;
<P>
Besides Chairman Kemp, <a href="/taxcom/commlst.html">Commission members</a> include

<h3>Tax Reform Commission Holds Five Public Hearings in September</h3>
</CENTER>

<P>
 
<P>
<blockquote>
<B>WASHINGTON, D.C. -</B> The
National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform, chaired
by Jack Kemp, will hold five public hearings during September
as the group continues to gather testimony from taxpayers and
tax experts around the country about the need for reform. 
<P>
The commission's next hearing will be<B> Friday,
September 8, </B>in Los Angeles at the Museum of Natural History
at 900 Exposition Boulevard in South Central LA. The hearing will
begin at 9 a.m.  It is free, and the public is invited.  Local
citizens will present their views on the problems with the current
tax system and principles of reform. Other hearings will be held
this month in New York City in Harlem on Wednesday, September
20; at Howard University in Washington, D.C., on Tuesday, September
26; and inner-city Cleveland, Ohio, September 27.
<P>
By the end of September, the Tax Reform Commission
will have held 12 public meetings.  The commission is determined
to &quot;listen first.&quot; It is holding this series of public
hearings to learn from the American people their frustrations,
fears, and concerns with the federal income tax system  as it
develops its recommendations.
<P>
Senate Leader Bob Dole and House Speaker Newt Gingrich
have charged the 14-member commission with making recommendations
for a tax code that is &quot;flatter, fairer, and simpler&quot;
-- a system that will encourage economic growth and greater opportunity
for all Americans.
<P>
One of the most important aspects of the commission's
work is to talk with Americans from all walks of life -- small
business people, farmers, factory workers, inventors, and entrepreneurs
-- who make America work.
<P>
&quot;In all corners of the country, we have found
overwhelming anger and frustration with the current system, but
much more needs to be learned before Congress can move forward
with change,&quot; Chairman Kemp said.
<P>
The commission has been asked to study ways in which
the current tax code -- with its high marginal tax rates and thousands
of pages of rules, regulations, and red tape -- poses a barrier
to economic growth.
<UL>
<LI>It punishes the most dynamic forces for growth
in our economy -- the small business owners and entrepreneurs
who turn bold ideas into new businesses, new jobs, and new products.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>It discourages working Americans who are trying
to save for the future and to build a better life for themselves
and their families.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>It is endlessly complex and confusing, costing
literally billions of dollars in lost time and effort.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
The commission hopes to present recommendations that
will make the tax code more family friendly and create incentives
for saving and investment. It hopes to help guide the tax reform
debate toward changes that will reinvigorate entrepreneurship,
risk taking, saving, investment, and work effort. It hopes to
contribute to changes that will make America more competitive
and expand the nation's worldwide leadership in the 21st century
economy. 
<P>
Among the issues it is studying:  What are the implications
to the economy of a steeply progressive tax system? What is the
impact on economic growth of higher marginal tax rates? What do
people mean whey they say they want a &quot;fairer&quot; tax system?
 What do we mean by &quot;flatter&quot; tax rates?  &quot;There
are a lot of different views, and we want to know what the American
people think and what are the ramifications,&quot; Kemp said.
<P>
&quot;We are setting the stage for a 21st century
tax policy for America.  We hope that this series of hearings
will help all of us to learn more about the changes that are needed
to make better informed decisions about the hard choices that
lie ahead,&quot; Kemp said. &quot;If we can find the core, central
principles of a new vision for tax reform that includes everyone's
views, we can get this done. The American people -- and our children
and grandchildren-- will be the winners.&quot;
<P>
The commission expects to issue its recommendations
and report by the end of the year.

<h3>TAX REFORM FIELD HEARING TO BE HELD IN CHARLOTTE,
SPONSORED BY THE NATIONAL COMMISSION

</CENTER>

<P>
<P>
<blockquote><B>WASHINGTON, D.C. -</B> &quot;Designing a flatter, fairer and
simpler tax system that will encourage economic growth and greater
opportunity for all our people,&quot; is how Jack Kemp described
his goal as Chairman of the recently formed National Commission

<P>
Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole
(R-KS) have appointed Jack Kemp, co-Director of Empower America,
to chair the 14 member Commission consisting of leaders in both
the public and private sectors.  Kemp states the purpose of the
TRC is &quot;to study how major restructuring of our tax code
can help unleash the entrepreneurial spirit of Americans, grow
the economy without inflation and create greater opportunity for
people to escape poverty.&quot;  
<P>
In its first field hearing on July 19, Commission members gathered
in Boston to begin discussions on tax reform.  Over one hundred
business leaders, government representatives, and citizens attended
the hearing to share their views. On August 2nd the Commission
travelled to Omaha, Nebraska for its second public hearing to
hear from business owners, farmers, and tax analysts.
<P>

&quot;The Commission will gather the views of American citizens
from all walks of life and collect and analyze the best available

The Commission is expected to issue its recommendation and its
report in December.  The Commission's report will provide recommendations
that will contribute to reinvigorating entrepreneurship, risk-taking,
savings, investment, and work efforts.  Our goal is to offer ideas
for a major overhaul of the tax system to make America more competitive,
expand the nation's worldwide leadership in the 21st century global
economy, and help eliminate, where they exist, any conditions
of despair and poverty,&quot; Kemp said.

<h3>Tax Reform Commission Continues Public Hearings</h3>
</CENTER>

<P>
<blocquote>
The National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform continues
to hold weekly hearings to explore the problems with the current
tax code and principles for reform.  The commission's next public
hearing is being held Wednesday, July 26, in the Lehrman Auditorium
at The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., N.E.  It will
begin at 9:30 a.m. and is open to the public.
<P>
 &quot;We know far too much about what doesn't work, and we know
that those who are hurt most by bad public policies, especially
tax policy, are those at the bottom of the economic ladder,&quot;
said Commission Chairman Jack Kemp. 
<P>
&quot;While there is overwhelming anger and frustration with the
current system, we need to explore more about citizens' experiences
with problems and solutions before we can go forward with radical
change,&quot; he said.
<P>
For example, what are the implications to the economy of a steeply
progressive tax system? What is the impact on economic growth
of higher marginal tax rates? What do people mean whey they say
they want a &quot;fairer&quot; tax system?  What do we mean by
&quot;flatter&quot; tax rates?  &quot;There are many different
views, and we want to know what the American people think and
what are the ramifications of various options for change,&quot;
Kemp said.
<P>
The commission will develop recommendations designed to make the
tax code more family friendly and create incentives for saving
and investment. Members will focus on proposals to reinvigorate
entrepreneurship, risk taking, saving, investment, and work effort.
Their charge is to develop recommendations for changes that will
make America more competitive and expand the nation's worldwide
leadership in the 21st century economy. 
<P>
Senator Dole and Speaker Gingrich, who created the Tax Reform
Commission,  asked commissioners to study ways in which the current
tax code -- with its &quot;high marginal tax rates and thousands
of pages of rules, regulations, and red tape -- poses a barrier
to economic growth.&quot; As they said:
<UL>
<LI>It punishes the most dynamic forces for growth in our economy
-- the small business owners and entrepreneurs who turn bold ideas
into new businesses, new jobs, and new products.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>It discourages working Americans who are trying to save for
the future and to build a better life for themselves and their
families.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>It is endlessly complex and confusing, costing literally billions
of dollars in lost time and effort.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
&quot;One of the most important aspects of our work is to talk
with Americans from all walks of life -- small business people,
farmers, factory workers, inventors, and entrepreneurs -- who
make America work. We will be holding hearings across the country
over the next several months to talk with taxpayers and to hear
from experts who study tax policy,&quot; said Commission Vice
Chairman Ed Feulner, President of the Heritage Foundation.
<P>
&quot;I am proud to serve with the distinguished men and women
on this commission who have offered to give of their time and
energy and talents so that all Americans can have a better chance
at the American dream,&quot; Kemp said.  &quot;Individually and
collectively, my colleagues on the commission have a huge font
of knowledge, experience, and courage that can help guide our
work.
<P>
&quot;We are setting the stage for a 21st century tax policy for
America,&quot; said Kemp.  &quot;It is imperative that everyone
work together to advance this monumental task.  What we are undertaking
may feel at times like moving a mountain. Making the tax code
simpler will be a very complicated process.
<P>
&quot;We hope that this series of hearings -- in which both citizens
and experts present views -- will help all of us to learn more
and to make better informed decisions about the hard choices that
lie ahead. If we can find the core, central principles of a new
vision for tax reform that includes everyone's views, we can get
this done. The American people -- and our children and grandchildren--
will be the winners,&quot; Kemp said.

<h3><center>COMMISSION GOAL - A FLATTER, FAIRER AND SIMPLER TAX SYSTEM</h3></center>

<p>
<p>
	<b>WASHINGTON, D.C., JUNE 14 --</b> "Designing a flatter, fairer and simpler tax system 
that will encourage economic growth and greater opportunity for all our people," is how Jack 
Kemp described his goal as Chairman of the recently formed National Commission on 
Economic Growth and Tax Reform.
<p>
"Senator Dole and Speaker Gingrich had it exactly right," Kemp said, "when they 
announced the formation of the National Tax Reform Commission and said that the current 
federal tax code with its high marginal rates and thousands of pages of rules, regulations and 
red tape, poses a formidable barrier to economic growth.  It is quite frankly a disaster for 
everybody.  It is a system that needs not just reform but a complete overhaul.  We must 
concentrate on creating a tax code for the 21st century."
<p>
In his charge to the members of the National Tax Reform Commission Kemp said, "Tax 
reform must move toward making the tax code family friendly and create incentives for work, 
savings and entrepreneurship.  The congressional leadership has asked the National 
Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform to start with a blank piece of paper and 
design a system that is flatter, fairer and simpler -- one that will encourage strong economic 
growth and greater opportunity for all."
<p>
"The Commission will gather the views of American citizens from all walks of life and 
collect and analyze the best available analysis and evidence from the experts who study tax 
policy.  The Commission is expected to issue its recommendations and its report in December.  
The Commission’s report will provide recommendations that will contribute to reinvigorating 
entrepreneurship, risk-taking, savings, investment, and work efforts.  Our goal is to produce a 
report that will make America more competitive, expand the nation’s worldwide leadership in 
the 21st century global economy, and help eliminate, where they exist, any conditions of 
despair and poverty," Kemp said.
<p>
Commission members include Loretta H. Adams, President, Market Development, Inc.; 
J. Kenneth Blackwell, Ohio State Treasurer; Herman Cain, Chairman and CEO, Godfather’s 
Pizza, Inc.; Carroll A. Campbell, Jr., former Governor of South Carolina; Pete du Pont, former 
Governor of Delaware; Jack Faris, President and CEO, National Federation of Independent 
Business; Edwin J. Feulner, President, The Heritage Foundation; Matt Fong, California State 
Treasurer; Ted Forstmann, Partner, Forstmann Little & Co.; Dean R. Kleckner, President, 
American Farm Bureau Federation; Shirley D. Peterson, former IRS Commissioner; John 
Snow, Chairman, President and CEO, CSX Corporation; and John Wieland, President, John Wieland Homes, Inc.

<b>USA TODAY</b><br>
June 15, 1995
<p>
<center><b>KEMP STARTS TAX TALK:</b></center>
<p>
Former HUD secretary Jack Kemp opened the first meeting of a Republican tax
reform commission promising to give fair consideration to the full range of proposals for overhauling the tax code.  Kemp is a fan of a flat-rate income tax but said the 14-member commission, appointed by Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., and House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.,
would evaluate a wide variety of ideas.  In addition to a flat tax proposed by House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, he mentioned proposals for a consumption tax from Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee; a national sales tax from Sen. Dick Lugar, R-Ind.; and plans offered by House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., and Sen. Bill Bradley, D-NJ.
<p>
"It look partisan.  We're all men and women of the center-right of the spectrum" he said of the commission of business executives and former government officials "I’ve taken stands, probably every one of us . . . has taken a stand on one sort of tax code or another. We're going to approach

<center><h2>Kemp vows fairness with tax reform ideas</h2>
<p>
GOP commission takes up alternatives</center>
<p>
(AP) -- Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp opened the first meeting of a Republican tax reform commission yesterday by promising to give fair consideration to the full range of proposals for overhauling the tax code.
<p>
Mr Kemp is a fan of a flat-rate income tax, but he said the 14 member commission, appointed by Senate
Majority Leader Bob Dole of Kansas and House Speaker Newt Gingrich of Georgia, would evaluate a wide variety of ideas.
<p>
In addition to a flat tax proposed by House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas, he mentioned proposals for a consumption tax from Rep. Bill Archer of Texas chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee; a national sales tax from Sen. Richard G. Lugar of Indiana; and plans offered by House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt, Missouri Democrat and Sen. Bill Bradley, New Jersey Democrat.
<p>
"It looks partisan. We're all men and women of the center-right of the spectrum," Mr. Kemp said of the
commission of business executives and former government officials. "I've taken stands, probably every one of us . . . has taken a stand on one sort of tax code or another We're going to approach it as open-minded as we humanly possibly, politically can."
<p>
Mr. Dole and Mr Gingrich asked Mr. Kemp to head the National Commission on Economic Growth and
Tax Reform two months ago; it is expected to issue its findings late this year in time for the presidential
primary elections.
<p>
"In no small way, this is the first day of the 21st century, at least in terms of taxes," Mr. Kemp said "This
.. . will be at the center of attention in '96 for the American people."
<p>
Republicans, who seized control of Congress last year for the first time in four decades, are hoping to make tax reform as powerful an issue in 1996 as tax reduction was in 1994.
<p>
"If Congress just stops at reducing taxes, then it will not have finished its job," Mr. Dole said at a news
conference at the start of the commission meeting "Americans . . . gave us control of Congress for the first time because they were fed up with the status quo. Now if there's one status quo that needs changing it's the federal tax code."
<p>
Mr. Gingrich said he is "really astonished by the intensity of resentment and irritation with the IRS."

<h4>Kemp Says Members Will Consider Variety of Reform Options</h4>

Former housing secretary Jack Kemp opened the first meeting of a Republican tax reform commission
yesterday promising to give fair consideration to the full range of proposals for overhauling the tax code.
<p>
Kemp has advocated a flat-rate income tax, but said the 14-member commission, appointed by Senate
Majority Leader Robert J. Dole (R-Kan.) and House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), would evaluate a 
wide variety of ideas.

In addition to a flat tax proposed by House Majority Leader Richard, K. Armey (R-Tex.), Kemp mentioned proposals for a consumption tax from House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer (R-Tex.),  a national sales tax from Sen. Richard G. Lugar (R-lnd.) and plans offered by House Minority Leader  Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) and Sen. Bill Bradley (D-NJ.).

At a time when the new Reagan administration was finding its way in an often hostile capital city, The Times quickly established itself as an independent and influential voice that was willing to break the stories that the dominant Washington Post was not. <BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>By its second year of publication, the Associated Press listed The Times as the third most widely-quoted newspaper in the nation. President Reagan let it be known that The Washington Times was the first newspaper he read every morning. The Times was must reading for his successors as well, including especially President Clinton.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>The implications of this aggressive and competitive presence in the press arena of the nation's capital have been far-reaching. The hundreds of bureau chiefs of American and foreign publications based in Washington, D.C. have since 1982 had more than one menu from which to select their leads. The House Banking Scandal and the Whitewater investigation are among the many stories The Times played a key role in bringing to the light of day.<BR><IMG SRC="../images/nop.gif" ALT="" ALIGN=top WIDTH=30 HEIGHT=0>Calling itself "America's Newspaper," The Times' editors make it a point not to mock the values of it readers.

<I>Actual Course Descriptions</I><BR>
(Emphasis Added)</B>
<P>
<B>BROWN UNIVERSITY:
<P><I>Women's Studies 196b</B></I> <B><U>Christianity, 
Violence, and Victimization</B></U>  This seminar will 
examine historical and contemporary Christian 
theological perspectives on suffering and violence. 
While Christianity may be said to provide a remedy 
for evil, sin and suffering, contemporary critics, 
including feminist ones, argue the opposite: that 
<I>Christianity has helped to create and perpetuate 
a culture of violence, especially against women and 
other dispossessed persons</I>....  Attention will also be 
given to contemporary proposals for reconstructing Christian theology and ethics and transforming 
a culture of violence and abuse.
<P>
<P><B>CORNELL UNIVERSITY:
<P><I>Psychology 277 </I><U>The Social Construction 
of Gender</B></U>  This course addresses the very 
broad question of how an individual's gender and 
sexuality are constructed. Although some attention 
is given to biological perspectives, <I>the course 
emphasizes the social-psychological processes by which the 
culture transforms male and female newborns into 
&quot;masculine&quot; and &quot;feminine&quot; 
adults.</I> In addition to being quite interdisciplinary, the course is also 
oriented to <I>questioning the &quot;naturalness&quot; of not only 
masculinity and femininity, but exclusive heterosexuality 
as well.</I> Among some of the specialized topics 
discussed are psychological androgyny, egalitarian relationships, gender-liberated child rearing, 
the male centeredness of the work world, female 
sexuality, sexual harassment and homophobia. 
<P>
<P><B>AMHERST COLLEGE:
<P><I>Black Studies 53</B></I> <B><U>Black 
English</B></U>  An examination of the language of African-Americans. 
Topics will include the historical development of 
black English; a comparison of black English and 
standard American English features; a review of major theories of research on the language 
abilities of African-Americans; linguistic issues 
underlying the black English language/dialect controversy; 
the role of black English in creative expression; 
and the impact of black English on the social 
economic and education opportunities of African-Americans.
<P>
<P><B>GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY:
<P><I>English 134</B></I> <B><U>Prison 
Literature</B></U>  The United States has the highest per capita imprisonment 
rate in the world. Over four million people are on 
probation, parole, in jail or prison. In this context 
we will read a selection of literature by and about 
the imprisoned....  This course directly promotes 
service learning through community involvement with youth offender programs, ex-inmate 
organizations, criminal justice internships and 
prison tutoring programs. <I>Students will be asked to 
create an outreach that will join the incarcerated 
community with the community at large in order to help 
halt the &quot;prison mill.&quot; </I>
<P>
<P><B>UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN:
<P><I>Psychology 211</B></I> <B><U>Social 
Justice</B></U>  <I>Learn about racism, homophobia, sexism, rape, incest, domestic 
violence, eating disorders, substance abuse, the AIDS 
crisis, and teen pregnancy. </I>Develop supportive 
and helping relationships with people as they 
encounter special challenges throughout the life-span 
of teens through elderly, or <I>join with local 
agencies working to bring about change in the lives of people 
of color, women, gay men, and lesbians.</I>
<P>
<P><B>CHAPMAN UNIVERSITY:
<P><I>Peace Studies 341</B></I> <B><U>Reversing the Arms 
Race</B></U> Why did the U.S. and U.S.S.R. pursue a 
costly and ecocidal arms race in the wake of World 
War II? What are nuclear weapons and what threat 
do they pose to the planet? As the Cold War wanes, what dangers lie ahead due to the spread of 
weaponry? How might we all benefit from conversion from a military to a peacetime economy? How 
do we ensure national security while doing so? 
This course is a primer for citizenship in the 21st century.

<H2>Bizarre Leftist Themes Dominate College Classrooms</H2>

<B>Frivolous `Multicultural' Courses Demean the Value of a College Degree </B><BR>
An annual survey conducted by Young 
     America's Foundation reveals that, 
     students are being offered heavy doses 
     of Leftist indoctrination in their college courses.  The survey, which examines the 
curricula of the nation's top colleges and 
universities, found that the &quot;victim studies&quot; triad of 
race, gender, and class dominated the course 
offerings on all campuses, showing up in courses 
including &quot;Inequality:  Class, Race, and Gender,&quot; 
at Princeton; &quot;Race, Class, Gender, and Ethnicity 
in the City,&quot; at NYU; &quot;Race, Gender, and 
the Politics of Rock `n' Roll,&quot; at Columbia; and 
even &quot;Issues of Gender in Sport,&quot; at Brown.
<P>Young America's Foundation uncovers the farce of modern college curricula in its 
annual study, <I>Comedy and Tragedy:  College 
Course Descriptions and What They Tell Us About 
Higher Education Today</I>.  Now in its second edition, 
<I>Comedy and Tragedy</I> is an in-depth documentation of the efforts 
of radical Leftists to implement their ideology on 
the nation's top college campuses.
<P>With recent surveys showing over fifty percent of employers seeking 
highly-skilled college graduates, the curricula offered by 
the nation's leading universities is now more 
important than ever before.  With a job market 
stifled by government regulations, employers need 
to choose the next generation of the work-force with much care and attention.      
<P>An examination of what students are learning quickly reveals that 
many of today's colleges are not meeting the needs of the work-force or the 
students, because they do not provide the learning skills integral to life 
after graduation.  Today's curricula neglects our nation's founding 
principles in favor of pushing politically charged courses such as &quot;The History 
of Socialist Thought,&quot; and &quot;Feminist Reading, Lesbian Writing.&quot;  
<table align=right width="200" hspace="5">
<tr><td><IMG SRC="cornel.gif" ALT="Cornell West"  ><BR>
<B>Cornel West</B> of Harvard University is a self-avowed socialist who teaches courses such
as "The Thought of W.E.B. DuBois" in the school's Afro-American Studies Department</td>
</tr>
</table>
<P>When traditional fields of learning are covered, they are often 
covered from a Leftist perspective.  Such is the case with religion, as seen in 
Carleton College's &quot;Witches, Saints, and Seers;&quot; Fordham's &quot;Religion 
and Feminism;&quot; and Smith College's &quot;New Age America:  The Role 
of Mysticism in Secular Culture.&quot;  Christianity and other Western religions 
are almost always cast as being &quot;oppressive&quot; to minorities.  Observe Cornell's 
&quot;Gender and Sexuality in Early Christianity;&quot; or 
UPenn's &quot;The Historical Origins of Racism:  Views 
of Blacks in Early Judaism, Christianity, and 
Islam;&quot; and &quot;A Feminist Critique of Christianity.&quot;  
There are no reports of a course dealing with the &quot;Christian Critique of Feminism,&quot; however.  
<P>Even hard sciences, such as physics and biology, must yield to the forces of 
Political Correctness.  Princeton students can learn 
about &quot;Gender and Science,&quot; which offers a 
&quot;feminist critique of scientific knowledge.&quot;  
Dartmouth College explores &quot;the wider implications of 
the contemporary critique of rational, binary, hierarchical, and patriarchal thinking&quot; in a 
course called &quot;Ways of Knowing:  Physics, 
Literature, Feminism.&quot;  Science also seems to be affected 
by the racial politics of multiculturalism, 
warranting an examination of &quot;Afrocentric Health 
Care Systems&quot; at Emory University.  
<P>These frivolous courses have now spread to all types of schools, 
from large State-run universities to small liberal arts colleges.  
Amherst College offers &quot;Taking Marx Seriously,&quot; 
for example.  The University of Georgia hopes to 
educate its students in the &quot;History and Analysis of 
Rock Music.&quot;  &quot;Freud, Fairy Tales, and Feminism&quot; is an 
official course at UCLA, and Fordham University offers a course 
simply entitled:  &quot;Victimology.&quot; 
<table align=left width="200" hspace="5">
<tr><td><IMG SRC="cartoon.gif" ALT="Cartoon" ><BR>
<B>Students <I>and </I>employers</B> are beginning to realize that college 
diplomas aren't worth much when students are taking &quot;victim studies&quot; courses 
such as Notre Dame's &quot;Economics of Gender and Ethnic Discrimination.&quot;<BR>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<P>
Classes that often offend a student's morals, upbringing, or religion are common fare 
in today's colleges, such as &quot;The History of 
Witchcraft and Magic,&quot; at Rutgers University, and 
a course drawing parallels between 
&quot;Christianity, Violence, and Victimization&quot; at Brown.
<P>
<I>Comedy and Tragedy </I>allows those outside 
of the Ivory Tower walls to see inside for themselves.  This study is especially helpful for 
concerned alumni, as they cannot rely upon the sterilized alumni publications of their alma 
mater to expose the proliferation of these bizarre classes.

On August 14, 1983 a seventeen year old Afghan Freedom Fighter spoke to Young 
America's Foundation's summer conference. He told of his struggle, including suffering the loss of 
his family and being personally maimed by the Soviet troops that invaded his country.
<P>The following day, Monday, August 15, a group of American students, led by 
<B>Floyd Brown</B> of Washington and <B>Will 
Faron</B> of Florida, staged a protest against the Soviet invasion in 
front of the Soviet compound in Washington. Many news cameras were already on site to cover 
a hoped-for defection of the son of the KGB chief who was being held hostage in 
the compound. This combination of events garnered the conservatives national 
television coverage.
<P>Brown and Faron were arrested and prosecuted for their &quot;political&quot; 
anti-Communist demonstration even though no individuals were ever prosecuted for the many 
anti-South Africa demonstrations in front of that embassy. The D.C. government claimed it 
was &quot;untenable&quot; to prosecute 
<I>those</I> demonstrators. Hundreds of Leftists had violated the 
same law including the Kennedys, Jesse Jackson, Amy Carter, and former U.S. Attorney 
General Ramsey Clark, and yet not a single liberal was prosecuted! Brown and Faron were 
thrown into the D.C. Central jail with hardened criminals and denied any opportunity to plea bargain.

<B>Bridget Brooker</B>, and George Washington University YAF leader 
<B>Michael Waller </B> filed a Federal action, <I>Boos v. Barry, 
</I>to halt the fifty year ban of demonstrations against Communist embassies. They lost at the district and 
appellate court hearings but the inconsistency of the government was gaining increased attention. 
<P>Finally, on March 22, 1988 the United States Supreme 
Court found that the young conservatives' Constitutional 
rights were violated. In a 5 to 3 decision written by 
Justice <B>Sandra Day O'Connor</B>, the Court held 
that &quot;our own citizens must tolerate insulting, and even outrageous, speech in order to 
provide adequate breathing space to freedoms protected by the 
First Amendment.&quot; 
<P>Brown's and Faron's convictions were overturned and 
the fifty years of the State Department protecting 
Communist governments from the free expression of the 
American people was over. The American Bar Association later called 
it one of the most important decisions of the Supreme Court.<BR>

<P>&quot;NEWT! NEWT! NEWT!&quot; chanted the three hundred student leaders as longtime Young America's 
Foundation lecturer, and newly installed Speaker of the House, 
<B>Newt Gingrich</B> entered the Cannon Caucus Room for 
a triumphant Foundation banquet. The July 26, 1995 event was carried by all major television networks and 
was followed by the Speaker signing copies of his book,
<I>To Renew America, </I>for Young America's 
Foundation students.

<P>The leader of the 1994 &quot;Republican

was organized by Foundation Vice-President <B>Ron

In early 1991 America was heading toward war in the Persian Gulf 
because of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Students seemed eager to support 
American troops and not follow the 1960s model when campus-based Leftists 
undermined America's armed forces. But college administrators were hostile to 
any patriotic sentiments. Some campuses, such as the University of 
Maryland, banned any display of the American flag!
<P>Young America's Foundation would have nothing to do 
with this &quot;political correctness&quot; and helped organize support 
for America's soldiers. An exemplary rally was held at Washington 
and Lee University by Foundation W&amp;L leader 
<B>Marc Short</B> and University of Virginia campus 
activist <B>Kate Obenshain</B>. They brought 
former Vietnam POW Admiral <B>Jeremiah Denton</B> onto campus for the first 
time since his imprisonment in the North Vietnamese &quot;Hanoi Hilton.&quot; The 
student response was spirited, with thousands of flag-waving students responding with 
the strongest patriotic fervor seen on campus in decades.

A similar rally, but this time a post-Persian Gulf war 
event, occurred on February 13, 1992, organized by Foundation 
Director <B>James Lacy</B> and staffer <B>Peter 
Schweizer</B> at Chapman University. Gulf war hero General 
<B>Norman Schwarzkopf</B> addressed over 3,000 supportive students while many 
of the Chapman faculty protested outside. General Schwarzkopf 
put an end to the &quot;Vietnam war syndrome&quot; that cast 
American military leaders in the role of villains. Norman took 
the country, and the campus, by storm--giving a real 
life example of why he is called Stormin' Norman!<BR>

Young America's Foundation leaders <B>Frank

renowned Conservative Political Action Conferences (CPACs) in the 
mid-1970s when they were leaders in Young Americans for Freedom.

<B>Ronald Reagan</B> was showcased at these conferences and its participants 
were looking forward to the March 1981 CPAC when newly elected 
President Reagan would again address CPAC.
<P>Young America's Foundation was a co-sponsor of the dinner, 
Foundation Director <B>James Lacy </B>was the master 
of ceremonies, and key Foundation supporters, including 
<B>John Engalitcheff</B>, were on hand for that electric 
night. Reagan chronicled the history of the conservative movement in one of his 
most moving speeches. Ronald Reagan has had a long and close affiliation with 
Young America's Foundation, but that March 20, 1981 evening at 
Washington's Mayflower Hotel was truly special.
<P>Nine days later, at a nearby Washington hotel, President Reagan was shot 
by John Hinckley. John Engalitcheff would later suffer a fatal stroke at a White 
House event with President Reagan. Mr. Engalitcheff would later become 
Young America's Foundation's most generous supporter by donating an eight 
million dollar bequest. But that CPAC dinner brought these key leaders together in 
the Conservative Movement's greatest night of celebration. <BR>

The lecture program has always been the cornerstone of

lectures have transformed America's campuses as Young America's Foundation lecturers 
have garnered increasingly large audiences.
<P><B>William F. Buckley, Jr.</B>, the &quot;godfather&quot; of the young conservative 
movement, consistently draws large and enthusiastic audiences. His speech at the University 
of North Carolina at Chapel Hill on April 20, 1993 was particularly notable.

<P>One week later Bill Buckley was scheduled to speak in the same hall. 
Young America's Foundation supplemented its usual promotions

 The two were married in 1945 and founded the Grover 
Hermann Foundation in the 1950s.  Mrs. Hermann became the foundation's president upon the death of her 
husband in 1979.  The Hermanns were early supporters 
of the conservative movement, and continued their support

Young America's Foundation is pleased to announce 
     the <I>Sarah T. Hermann Scholarship </I>intern program, 
     created in memory of one of the Foundation's most 
     loyal supporters.  The purpose of this program is 
to develop a cadre of young conservative leaders for our 
country through the hands-on experience that only an internship 
can provide.  The program will also provide direct financial 
assistance to these interns, who will be chosen from among 
the Foundation's finest student leaders.
<P>Young America's Foundation will seek out 
motivated students to serve as semester- or summer-long interns.  
Student leaders selected as <I>Hermann </I>interns will conduct 
original research on campus issues to be published and distributed 
as issue briefs.  <I>Sarah T. Hermann </I>interns will also be involved 
in planning Foundation conferences and lectures, and will, in 
the course 
of their duties, be encouraged to become more involved in 
the Conservative Movement and expand their knowledge 
of conservative and free market ideas and principles.
<P>In the past, many of the Foundation's most 
dedicated student activists have been former interns.  Now, through 
the generosity of the Grover Hermann Foundation, 
Young America's Foundation will be able to greatly increase 
the number of students participating as Foundation interns, 
and will simultaneously help to strengthen America's next 
generation of leaders.

<P>The Foundation's efforts to fight the Leftist monopoly on our nation's campuses is a

<h3><a name="quayle"></a>Quayle Addresses Thousands of Students at Foundation Lectures</h3><p>
<b>Vice-President Draws 1100 at Southeast Missouri State and 900 at Northwestern</b><p>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]</center><P>
In a matter of hours, all 900 tickets made                available to students at Northwestern      
          University were taken by young people      
          eager to hear former Vice-President 
<B>Dan Quayle</B>.
<P>&quot;The demand was much greater than we anticipated,&quot; remarked 
<B>Kevin Frost</B>, the Northwestern student who coordinated the 
event with Young America's Foundation.  &quot;This 
was truly a great speech,&quot; he added.  &quot;There 
aren't many events on campus when tickets are all taken within hours and the crowd is as 
enthusiastic as this one was tonight.&quot;
<P>This spring, Mr. Quayle has addressed standing-room-only crowds at 
Northwestern University and Southeast Missouri State 
University, speaking on the values and principles upon which our country is built, and 
the qualities and characteristics our national 
leaders need to possess.
<P>&quot;Character <I>does </I>matter,&quot; the former 
Vice-President assured students.  &quot;The 
American people today simply want to have a 
president who will tell the truth.  It's that simple.&quot;
<P>The Quayle speech was greatly anticipated by students at both campuses.  
Young America's Foundation has found that students are eager to hear conservative and free 
market ideas and will turn out enthusiastically 
when given the opportunity.  Many students are now beginning to protest when their professors 
and administrators exclusively promote Leftist 
ideas on campus.  Prior to Mr. Quayle's Northwestern University speech, many students 
expressed these very sentiments:
<P>Northwestern student <B>Jason Goch </B>was one of many students who was anxious to hear 
an alternative message, saying that he hoped that Mr. Quayle would &quot;provide a bit of balance 
to the overwhelming number of liberal speakers who are brought here.&quot;
<P>Student <B>Danny Rashburn</B>, who serves as the head of Northwestern's student 
Senate, commented that even though he considered 
himself a liberal, he was anxious to hear Mr. Quayle speak. 
 &quot;I'm pretty involved with politics and I 
don't really know much of what he stands for because 
the media has developed an image of him that preceded 
all of his politics,&quot; he admitted.  &quot;I'm 
interested in seeing not only what he stands for but whether or not 
that image is correct.  It will definitely be one of 
the most memorable events for me.&quot;
<P>In his speech before 1100 students at Southeast Missouri State, Mr. Quayle 
stressed the need for a less burdensome tax system, 
and the need for our country to dismantle the welfare system.
<P>
&quot;I'm not talking about just reforming [the welfare system],&quot; Mr. Quayle declared.  
&quot;Some people say that all we need is to tinker with 
it on the edges, just a little reform.  Well, 
forget it.  It doesn't work.  It doesn't help the 
homeless, doesn't help the poor, and doesn't help 
the disadvantaged.  The system is a destroyer of families.  It penalizes marriages, it 
discourages work and it subsidizes illegitimacy.  What 
kind of system is that?  We have unfortunately created a culture of dependency, where we need a culture of opportunity.&quot; 
<P>Vice-President Quayle is just one of the highlights of the Foundation's spring 
lecture program which features such prominent 
figures as Supreme Court Justice <B>Clarence 
Thomas</B> at Southeast Missouri State on April 30, 
<B>William F. Buckley</B> at Weber State University on 
April 18, <B>Jack Kemp</B> at Loyola 
University-Chicago on April 24, <B>Edwin Meese</B> at the University

firsthand, the thoughts and principles espoused by 
our country's greatest leaders and thinkers.  Over the years, Young America's Foundation 
has been fortunate to develop close working relationships with many of America's most 
distinguished congressional leaders, and has been able to bring their valuable messages to 
students, who represent the next generation of national leaders.
<P>Each summer, at the Foundation's National Conservative Student Conference, 
attending students are treated to a Congressional 
Briefing featuring conservative legislators from both 
the House and Senate.  In past years, students 
have been able to meet and hear from figures such as Speaker <B>Newt Gingrich</B>, Senate 
Majority Leader <B>Robert Dole</B>, Senator <B>Phil 
Gramm</B>, House Majority Leader <B>Dick Armey</B>, 
Senate Majority Whip <B>Trent Lott</B>, 
Conservative Democratic Forum founder 
Representative <B>Charles Stenholm</B>, and Senator 
<B>Jesse Helms</B>, to name just a few.  The Foundation's 
Congressional Briefing is often carried on C-SPAN, 
and last summer, a special Foundation luncheon with Speaker Gingrich was covered by 
NBC, ABC, and CBS.  
<P>This briefing is organized each year by the Foundation's vice-president, 
<B>Ron Pearson</B>, who served as chief of staff to 
Representative <B>John Ashbrook </B>and Representative 
<B>Bill Dannemeyer</B> before opening his own 
political management and government relations 
consulting firm on Capitol Hill.  Mr. Pearson notes that he tries 
to find congressmen who might have a wider appeal 
to students than simply just as a &quot;politician.&quot;  
<P>&quot;I try to identify congressmen who would have 
an interesting message for college students.  That's one of the 
first things I look at,&quot; says Mr. Pearson.  &quot;I 
try to look at freshman members and newer members who 
might be of interest, and that's how I first started 
inviting Congressman Gingrich almost seven years ago.  
Although he was known as a `backbencher' back then, he really wasn't.  He was a leader 
in the House as far as having some strong ideas on how to take control of 
the Congress.  He was also very active on issues in Congress.  So I started 
inviting him because I thought he would be of special interest to the students, and 
also because he was a college professor before he became a congressman.&quot;
<P>Many of the most popular speakers at the Foundation's Congressional 
Briefing share an academic background.  In addition to Speaker Gingrich, who 
was once a history professor at West Georgia College, other former professors 
include Senator Gramm, Representative Armey, and Representative 
<B>Phil Crane</B>, who has spoken before Foundation audiences 
for more than 15 years.  Congressman Armey notes that his experiences as 
a college professor give him a great understanding of the unique service that

<HR>
<blockquote>
<B>&quot;I have worked closely with Young America's Foundation over the years 
and have found their commitment to promoting balance, academic 
integrity, and free market values on campuses is unsurpassed.  If students are 
serious about effectively challenging the liberal monopoly on campus, they must 
contact Young America's Foundation.&quot;
<P> Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich</B><BR>
</blockquote>
<HR>
America's Foundation conferences provide.  &quot;As a former professor myself, I know 
the challenge that these students face on college campuses,&quot; he acknowledges.  &quot;The work 
of Young America's Foundation is a useful antidote to the usual liberal litany on the 
college campus.&quot;
<P>Above all, Mr. Pearson looks for speakers that are activist leaders and who have 
bold ideas and a strong message.  When asked what sets these leaders apart from the rest, he 
replied that he seeks legislators who &quot;want to come 
to Congress to <I>do things</I>, rather than just come 
to Congress.  They have some idea in mind of 
<I>why</I> they were elected to Congress and what 
they want to accomplish.  They have some specific ideas, not just, `Well, I want to make 
things better.'  You can usually tell when members 
get to Congress, in their first couple years, if they're going to be active or inactive.&quot;
<P>Mr. Pearson also recruits speakers whose lives can serve as an inspiration to students. 
 One such speaker, Representative <B>Chris Cox</B> 
of California, is an excellent role model for students.  &quot;When Chris was in law school,&quot; 
Mr. Pearson explains, &quot;he was working on his 
MBA at the same time he was working on his Law degree, and he was also one of the editors 
of the <I>Harvard Law Review</I>.&quot;  Mr. Pearson 
points out that congressmen such as Chris Cox, 
<B>Dana Rohrabacher</B>, and <B>Mark Souder</B> were 
conservative activists as students and &quot;have 
remained conservative activists in Congress.&quot;
<P>Mr. Pearson also has advice for students wishing to pursue careers on Capitol Hill: 
 &quot;The important thing is to get involved 
early, as a student, get involved on a 
philosophical basis.  Be well educated and well read.  So 
you not only have a knowledge of the issues, but also 
the philosophy behind them.  It gives you a much wider 
background and better grasp of the process and lets you 
handle issues much easier; particularly if you want to work in 
a congressional office.
<P>&quot;As a student, it is also important to be involved, 
by bringing speakers to campus, by sponsoring the 
programs that the Foundation encourages, because that helps to 
develop the skills that are necessary to succeed in any field.&quot;

<B><a name="rotc"></a>New Law Prohibits Defense Department Funding of Schools that Discriminate Against ROTC </b><BR>
<h3>Foundation, ROTC Students Defeat Campus Leftists</h3>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]</center><P>
Young America's Foundation activists scored a major victory  on February 10, when the ROTC Campus Access Act was signed into law by the President.  The legislation, which cuts off Department of Defense funding to colleges and 
universities that ban the Reserve Officer Training Corps was part of this year's 
Defense Authorization Act.  It was introduced following a public information 
campaign, conducted by Young America's Foundation, designed to expose 
unfair discrimination against ROTC cadets and bolsters the right of students to 
participate in ROTC on their campuses.
<P>The law marks a huge defeat for campus radicals intent on 
denying students the right to participate in military programs on campus.  
Historically, the ROTC program has assisted economically disadvantaged 
students, providing scholarships for those willing to make a commitment to serve 
their country.  By limiting access to ROTC, many academics who purport to 
promote diversity and educational opportunity have in reality undermined these ideals. 
 Many poor and middle class students are able to afford the costly price of higher 
education solely because of the financial assistance 
ROTC provides. <B> Colin Powell</B>, Secretary of 
Education <B>Richard Reilly</B>, Senator <B>Strom 
Thurmond</B>, and former senator and current University of Oklahoma President 
<B>David Boren</B> are a few of the many 
distinguished Americans who benefited from the 
ROTC program.
<P>The first massive wave of expulsions of ROTC programs dates back to the 
Vietnam War, when radical activists forced the 
military off campus through protests, violent 
demonstrations, and even bombings.  Today, many of those same 1960s protesters now call the 
shots on campus as faculty and administrators, 
using the armed forces' &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; 
policy on homosexuals as a pretense to prevent students from participating in ROTC. 
<P>Many Young America's Foundation supporters will remember the story of 
<B>Flagg Youngblood </B>and the persecution that he 
and his fellow ROTC cadets at Yale University faced.  Banned from meeting on their 
own campus by leftist faculty and administrators, Yale's cadets are forced to travel 65 miles to 
the nearest ROTC unit if they wish to participate 
in the program.  Not only does this policy cut off educational opportunities for students and 
deny the armed forces the quality officers it 
deserves, it also endangers the lives of students 
who choose to defend our country.  Three times in the past two years cadets making the trip to 
the distant campus have been involved in serious car accidents.  These accidents were 
attributed to slick New England winter roads and 
exhausted cadets falling asleep at the wheel.  
This is all happening while Yale's faculty and 
administrators solicit and accept Department of Defense research grants and contracts. 
<P>Sadly, Yale's hypocritical stance of banning ROTC while accepting defense funds is 
followed by a number of other schools including Harvard, Stanford, Columbia, and Brown 
to name a few.  
<P>After Young America's Foundation disseminated these disturbing facts to the 
general public, members of Congress began taking action against academia's 
pervasive anti-military policies.  This educational campaign included 
appearances on over 20 talk shows, including National Empowerment Television's 
<I>Capitol Watch</I>, where Foundation staffers described the discrimination members 
of the armed forces face on campus.  A petition drive succeeded in alerting 
tens of thousands of Americans to the problems patriotic students serving 
their country encounter as a result of leftist faculty and administrators.  
<P>An education campaign by Young America's Foundation activists both 
on Capitol Hill and through the mail resulted in Congressman 
<B>Richard Pombo</B> introducing the ROTC Campus Access Act.  Revealing op/ed 
articles written by Foundation Program Officer <B>Dan Flynn 
</B>for <I>The Washington Times</I> and <I>Human 
Events</I>  the latter of which was read from on the floor of the 
House of Representatives by Congressman <B>Jack 
Kingston</B>  provided much of the information used in debate against 
anti-military colleges and universities.
<P>With the passage of the ROTC Campus Access Act, ROTC supporters look to 
the future with much optimism, citing the example of a 1993 law which cut off Defense funds 
for schools that banned military recruiters from meeting with students on campus. 
Following the passage of that legislation, all but one of 
the 140 colleges and universities which had previously banned military recruiters opened 
their doors rather than risk a loss of funding.  It 
is uncertain whether any school will continue to ban ROTC 
and risk losing millions of dollars in grants and 
contracts.
<P>Commenting on the success of this type of strategy, 
Young America's Foundation President <B>Ron 
Robinson </B>explained, &quot;While left-wing 
academics may not listen to reason, they often listen 
when the flow of money, the lifeline of many colleges 
and universities, is jeopardized.&quot;<BR>

<BR>
<B>Conservative Political Action Conference Luncheon Features Radio, T.V. Host Armstrong Williams</B><P>
[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]</center><P>

&quot;Personal responsibility.  Economic independence.  Thrift.  The work ethic.  Optimism.  Hope.  Ambition.  Enthusiasm.  Perseverance.  Pride... These are some of the many values my parents taught their children...&quot;  And they are some of the many ideals <B>Armstrong 
Williams</B> imparted to his <B>student audience of 300</B> at a recent Young America's Foundation's luncheon. Armstrong Williams is the host of two nationally syndicated radio programs, 
<I>The Right Side</I> and <I>The Armstrong Williams  Show</I>, and a weekly program which airs on 
National Empowerment Television.  His columns frequently appear in <I>Reader's Digest </I>and <I>USA Today</I>, and run nationally on the  <I>L.A. Times</I> Syndicate.  He is the author of 
<I>Beyond Blame:  How We Can Succeed by Breaking the Dependency Barrier</I>, and also serves as the CEO of a Washington D.C. based public relations firm.
<P>Mr. Williams' message of personal responsibility and the importance of family 
resonated with the students and was met with fervent applause as he stated, &quot;Families are the 
first, best departments of Health, Education, and Welfare.  Our policies must assist families, rather than punish marriage and reward promiscuity.  Our policies should encourage industry, rather than reward indolence.  Our laws should be equally and fairly applied to all Americans, offering opportunity to all, and special treatment to no one, be they wealthy or poor, man or woman, black, white or brown.&quot;
<P>Held annually in Washington, D.C., the Foundation's CPAC luncheon attracts 
student leaders from across the nation.  <B>Tina 
Tran</B>, a student from UCLA, thought Armstrong Williams' speech &quot;was absolutely fantastic!&quot;  Loyola College student <B>Sergio Vitale</B> was 
so inspired by Mr. Williams' message that he is already making plans to sponsor him on 
campus next fall.  &quot;Armstrong Williams' speech 
was by far the best event in the whole CPAC line-up!&quot; raved Sergio.
<P>Deeply proud of the liberties we cherish in America, Armstrong Williams impressed 
upon the students that, &quot;Freedom is not free.  
It requires as much exertion to maintain it as to establish it.  Especially in a free nation, 
every citizen has certain duties:  to him-self, his family, and to his 
fellow countrymen.  Freedom requires risks, but 
its rewards are great.&quot;<BR>

Court finds University of Virginia Committed "Viewpoint Discrimination"</h4>[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]<P></center></center>
<p>
On June 29, in a dramatic victory for students on campuses, the Supreme Court vindicated what conservatives have been arguing for years: universities are not permitted to treat religious speech as second class speech. In <i>Rosenberger v. Rector and the Visitors of the University of Virginia</I>, the Court determined that the University of Virginia discriminated against a Christian student newspaper when it denied the paper equal access to student activity fees. Young America's Foundation Program Officer <b>Ron Rosenberger</B>, who had founded the magazine, <i>Wide Awake</I>, while a student and Foundation activist at the University of Virginia, was the plaintiff in the case.
<p>
Mr. Rosenberger said, "The decision puts an end to the double standard used in university funding of student groups and guarantees a free marketplace of ideas on campuses across the country."
<p>
The Supreme Court case grew out of a 1991 decision by the University of Virginia to deny funds to a Christian publication due to its content. This decision came despite the fact that the university funded Jewish and Muslim groups on the basis of their being "cultural" activities. Funds were also granted to 116 other student groups, including Students for Animal Rights, the National Organization of Women, and several homosexual advocacy groups. Believing that he had been denied equal access to student activity fees,  Mr. Rosenberger, a Young America's Foundation activist, took his school to court.
<p>
The Supreme Court decided on the side of Christian students and Wide Awake. In a damning indictment of current university practices nationwide, Justice <B>Anthony M. Kennedy</b> wrote for the majority: "For the university, by regulation, to cast disapproval on particular viewpoints of its students risks the suppression of free speech and creative inquiry in one of the vital centers for nation's intellectual life, the college and university campuses."
<p>
Justice Kennedy argued that the most offensive aspect of UVa's position was that it monitored the content of student publications: "The viewpoint discrimination inherent in the university's regulation required public officials to scan and interpret student publications to discern their underlying philosophic assumptions reciting religious theory and belief.
<p>
"That course action," he continued, was a denial the right of be speech and would risk fostering
a pervasive bias or hostility to religion, which could undermine the very neutrality the Establishment Clause requires. There is no Establishment Clause violation in the University's honoring its duties under the Free Speech Clause."
<p>
In his dissent, Justice <b>David Souter</b> rationalized the university's position by stressing the religious content of the magazine. He quoted certain passages and cited the "frankly evangelistic character of the magazine" as justification for the university's actions.
<p>
Justice Kennedy took issue with the dissent, writing that Justice Souter's position would raise "the specter of governmental censorship, to ensure that all student writing and publications meet some baseline standard of secular orthodoxy. To impose that standard on student speech at a university is to imperil the very sources of free speech and expression.... official censorship would be far more inconsistent with the Establishment Clause's dictates than would governmental provision of secular printing services on a religion-blind basis."
<p>
In a concurring opinion, Justice <b>Clarence Thomas</b> wrote, "Though our Establishment Clause jurisprudence is in hopeless disarray, this case provides an opportunity to affirm one basic principle that has enjoyed an uncharacteristic degree of consensus: The Clause does not compel the exclusion of religious groups programs that are generally available to a broad class of participants."
<p>
Citing the intent of the Founding Fathers, Justice Thomas wrote, "The dissent identifies as evidence that the Framers intended to disable religious entities from participating on neutral terms in evenhanded government programs....Even if Madison believed that the principle of non-establishment of religion precluded government financial support for religion per se, there is no indication that at the time of the framing he took the dissent's extreme view that the government must discriminate against religious adherents by excluding them from more generally available financial subsidies."
<p>
Justice <b>Sandra Day O'Connor</b>, also concurring, wrote, "By withholding from Wide Awake assistance that the University provides generally to all other student publications, the University has discriminated on the
basis of the magazine's religious viewpoint in violation of the Free Speech Clause." Justice O'Connor relied on the principle of government's neutrality toward religion as the Court "held that schools may not discriminate against religious groups by denying them equal access to facilities that the schools make available to all."
<p>
She noted that widely divergent expressions of viewpoints are funded by the university, therefore there is no danger of any one opinion being perceived to be that of the university. She wrote, "Besides the general new publications, for example, the University has provided support to <I>The Yellow Journal</I>, a humor magazine that has targeted Christianity as a subject of satire, and <i>Al-Salam</I>, a publication to 'promote a better understanding of Islam to the University Community."'
<p>
Justice O'Connor opened the door to a challenge of the compulsory student activities fees "by an objecting student that she should not be compelled to pay for speech with which she disagrees."

of Rosenberger Decision</a></h3>
<h4>"Subdued Celebration" Urged In Wake of Supreme Court</h4>[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]<P></center><P>
One day after the landmark Supreme Court decision supporting the rights of religious students on campus, over 125 students from more than 50 colleges and universities gathered in the nation's capital for a conference sponsored by Young America's Foundation. The conference, held on June 30, highlighted the case's ramifications for college students and informed campus activists of their rights of free speech on campus.
<p>
The lead plaintiff in the case, Foundation Program Officer <b>Ron Rosenberger</b>, opened the conference, saying, "The Supreme Court sent a message loud and clear that it is unconstitutional to treat religious students as second-class citizens or religious speech as second-class speech. Publicly funded colleges and universities will no longer be able to exclude religious groups from benefits that are made available to a wide array of student groups."
<p>
Two student panels, composed of students who have been subjected to similar harassment at their schools, spoke to conference attendees. <b>Bryson Koehler</b>, a student at the University of North Carolina and editor of the independent student newspaper there, the Carolina Review, related the tale of his magazine's defunding by the school. The school found the Review "to be politically partisan" due to a picture of Jefferson Davis in the paper. Ironically, the school funds the Daily Tar Heel which ran a page devoted to the endorsement of political candidates. The Daily Tar Heel has come under no scrutiny from the funding agencies of the school. Mr. Koehler will follow Ron Rose Iberger's example and take his case to the Federal District Court in North Carolina.
<p>
<b>Morgan Knull</b>, a junior at Wabash College in Indiana and an intern with Young America's Foundation, said students have to be willing to "stand up and face public ridicule. There will be other students who are sympathetic, but you have to go against the grain." He went on against the grain." He went on to say that at most campuses today, "Liberals are like vampires lurking around at night: You have to expose them."
<p>
Mr. Knull told of the abuse with which religious students must contend at Wabash. The professor of a course in human sexuality showed the movie, 120 Days of Sodom, to his class and others "as a statement against the religious right." The movie, which has been banned in Italy and France for its obscenity, was deemed appropriate and necessary for students to view by the leftist professor. Mr. Knull stood up to his professor and challenged the appropriateness of the movie being shown in class. After bringing Mr. Knull up on harassment charges, the professor eventually dropped all charges and admitted that he should not have shown the film.
<p>
Mr. Knull exhorted students: "Don't water down your beliefs. I stand up for what I believe in because I love my school and want it to become again the institution of academic vigor that it used to be. Take your message outside your school if you need to.  Get involved with national groups which can help you, such as Young America's Foundation."
<p>
Syndicated columnist <b>Joseph Sobran</b> spoke to the conference, giving students a sobering perspective on the significance of the Rosenberger decision in its jurisprudence and historical context. He said many of the current problems conservative students face stem from the 16th Amendment which gave the federal government the power to levy income taxes. He said, "Direct taxing power gave enormous power to the federal government and, in effect, neutralized the rest of the Constitution." The Rosenberger decision, he said, was a ''tactical victory. . . . In this case, the federal government is still telling the state what it can and cannot do."
<p>
According to Mr. Sobran, "Education was compromised and corrupted once it became a state function. We should insist that religious people be given the same treatment as everyone." He concluded, "Let's have a subdued celebration in this victory and push on for a return to true federalism."
<p>
The 1995 Henry Salvatori Distinguished Lecturer, <b>M. Stanton Evans</b>, gave the closing remarks, saying that the Rosenberger victory is "one of the most important Supreme Court decisions in constitutional history." He said the decision challenged a 1947 decision by Justice Black which stated that the government may provide no support whatsoever for any religious sentiment. It is not possible, however, to "reconcile Black's decision with the activities of the Founding Fathers. Everything he says you shouldn't do, they were doing."
<p>
The purpose of the First Amendment, Mr. Evans said, "had nothing to do with Black's statement. It was intended to protect the states from intrusion by the federal government."
<p>
Young America's Foundation will continue to educate students about their religious and free speech rights on campus as a result of the Rosenberger decision.

<h3>New Foundation Staffers Fresh From Campus Battle<br></a>
Kingsley, Schenk Return To Foundation</h3>[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]</center><P>
Anxious to find an alternative to the liberal monopoly on campus, students are discovering that Young America's Foundation is the organization best able to provide that alternative through its celebrated speakers program and vast campus outreach network. In response to the increased volume of student requests for Foundation support and information, Young America's Foundation has added two new program officers to assist with campus outreach.
<p>
<b>Kristen Kingsley</b> and <b>Matthew Schenk</b>, both conservative activists, are fresh from the front-lines of the great clash of ideas taking place on the nation's campuses. Both served as interns for the Foundation during the summer of 1994, when Miss Kingsley organized the National Conservative Student Summer Conference, ant Mr. Schenk produced the Foundation's 25th Anniversary Report.
<p>
Mr. Schenk joined the Foundation's staff in June as a program officer, after graduating in May from Swarthmore College with a B.A. in English literature and political science. He served as editor-in-chief of Swarthmore's main student newspaper, The Phoenix, earning the distinction of being the first sophomore to ever hold that position. He also co-founded the Swarthmore College Republicans, and worked for <b>Rick Santorum's</b> 1994 Senate campaign.
<p>
Mr. Schenk became an ardent campus activist in the fall of 1993 when, with Young America's Foundation's assistance, he helped found the Swarthmore Conservative Union. The Foundation, recognizing Mr. Schenk's ability to contribute significantly to campus conservatism, assisted him in establishing an independent campus newspaper, Common Sense, with the goal of "providing an open and friendly forum for conservative views at Swarthmore." In his last two years at Swarthmore, Mr. Schenk and other campus activists brought nine Foundation speakers to this historically liberal college, including <b>William F. Buckley, Dinesh D'Souza, Star Parker</B>, and <b>Phyllis Schlafly</b>.
<p>
Mr. Schenk will use the experience he gained at Swarthmore to help students at other colleges get their message across. "I had so much fun creating controversy on campus during my four years at college," he admits, "I decided I wanted to make a career out of it."
<p>
The kind of "controversy" Mr. Schenk incited included a successful campaign to raise the American flag over the main building at Swarthmore, where it had been absent for the past 30 years. He also aroused the anger of the Swarthmore liberal establishment when he chartered a gun club dubbed SAFER: Swarthmore Advocates of Firearm Education and Recreation and pressured the college's budget committee into funding the group's outings. After only one year, SAFER has become the second largest recreational organization at Swarthmore.
<p>
Still, Mr. Schenk and his conservative allies at Swarthmore had an uphill battle to have their voices heard on a college that prides itself for "tolerance" and "diversity." The Swarthmore conservatives ran into many obstacles created by the liberal administration and student groups, and they achieved little success before Young America's Foundation took on their cause. "The Foundation's help really turned things around for us on campus, " Mr. Schenk said. After attending and helping to organize the Foundation's 1994 Summer I Conference as an intern, he decided that this was the kind of work to which he wanted to dedicate himself.
<p>
"There is no one on college campuses today who is as oppressed as the conservative student," Mr. Schenk points out. "And there is no group that does more to help these students than Young America's Foundation.
<p>
"We would not have had the impact we did at Swarthmore without the invaluable support of the Foundation," he adds. "Now, as a part of the Foundation's staff, I hope I can help other students make the same difference an their campuses."
<p>
Miss Kingsley's commitment to campus conservatism and her contagious enthusiasm make her a valuable addition to the staff. She believes this is a critical time for campus conservatism: "The whole country is becoming increasingly receptive to the traditional, free-market ideas that Young America's Foundation has advocated for over 25 years. Nowhere is this more true than on college campuses, where students have grown tired of the politically correct, socialist bias that their professors bring into the classroom on a daily basis."
<p>
Miss Kingsley, an Alabama native, joined the Foundation staff in June as a program officer and director of the National Conservative Student Conference. Since her arrival at the Foundation, Miss Kingsley coordinated the 17th Annual National Conservative Student Conference, held in Washington, D.C. in late July. The conference was an overwhelming success with over 400 students attending. With her outstanding interpersonal and organizational skills, Miss Kingsley will organize regional student conferences, including those to be held in Atlanta and Chicago during the school year.
<p>
For Miss Kingsley, the idea of planning such conferences is an appealing challenge: "I am anxious to work with speakers and students across the country as the Foundation continues its tradition of hosting the most effective regional student conferences in the nation." She believes that "exposing students in person to the ideas espoused by top national leaders is the most effective means of swelling the conservative ranks."
<p>
In May, 1995, Miss Kingsley graduated cum laude from Wake Forest University with a B.A. in politics and speech communication, and was inducted into honor societies in both S fields. An activist during her college years, Miss Kingsley attended the Foundation's 1993 National Summer Conference, and the spring of  1995, brought the foundation's Henry Salvatori lecturer, <b>Stan Evans</b>, to speak at Wake Forest. During the 1992 election, Miss Kingsley served <b>President Bush's</b> North Carolina advance team, and she volunteered for the campaigns of Congressman <b>Richard Burr</b> and Senator <b>Lauch Faircloth</b>.
<p>
In addition to being one of the nation's foremost campus activists and a stellar student, Miss Kingsley served as chairman of freshman orientation, a member of the student government legislature, a campus tour guide, an elementary school tutor, and even as a disc jockey on the campus radio station.

College graduation ceremonies are called "commencements" because they mark the beginning of post-college life. But in recent years college administrators are using the commencement ceremonies to send their students off with one more predictable Leftist lecture. In 1995, commencement exercises were dominated by Congressional Democrats, liberal media personalities, and Clinton Administration officials.
<p>
College administrators are reluctant to release lists of guest lecturers on their campuses because they fear criticism of their almost exclusively liberal line-up of speakers. However, commencement exercises are open to the general public and the identity of the guest speaker is obtainable. A survey of commencement addresses was conducted by Young America's Foundation of the nation's one hundred most selective colleges according to James Cass and Max Birnbaum's <i>Comparative Guide to American Colleges</I>. The results provide another insight into how our colleges offer an unbalanced view of our culture and public affairs. Instead of providing a new beginning, the commencement exercises continue the liberal bias that makes up much of a four year undergraduate education.
<p>
College administrators are enthralled with media and entertainment celebrities. National Public Radio's 
<B>Daniel Shorr</b> (Brandeis), CNN's <B>Catherine Crier</B> (Lehigh), AP's <b>Helen Thomas</b> (American), New York Times columnist <b>Russell Baker</b> (Connecticut College), CBS' <b>Dan Rather</b> (University of Texas), Washington Post columnist <b>William Raspberry</b> (University of Virginia), and ABC's <b>Ted Koppel</b> (Johns Hopkins) were among a long list of featured media personalities.
<p>
<b>Robert Redford and Quincy Jones</b> were Pomona's choices, <b>Barbra Streisand</b> joined Daniel Shorr as Honorary Degree recipients at Brandeis, and <b>Lynn Redgrave</b> was Centre College's commencement speaker.
<p>
Elected officials, at least if they are Democrats, are popular with the college administrators . President <b>Bill Clinton</b> addressed graduates at Dartmouth College. Congressman <b>George Brown</b> spoke at Claremont's Harvey Mudd, Congresswoman <b>Barbara Kennelly</b> at Trinity, Senator <b>Bill Bradley</b> at Rice, and Baltimore Mayor <b>Curt Schmoke</b> at Yale. The only Republican office holder to show up on this year's list was Congressman <b>Bob Livingston</b> at his alma mater, Tulane.
<p>
Clinton Administration officials made up the largest category of commencement speakers. Government officials were seldom invited during the Reagan-Bush years, indeed government critics dominated the list, but Clinton Administration officials are now welcomed with open arms.
<p>
Clinton's HHS Secretary <b>Donna Shalala</b> spoke at Syracuse University, Budget Director <b>Alice Rivlin</b> at the University of Iowa, Energy Czar <b>Hazel O'Leary</b> at Vassar, and Economic Advisor <b>Laura Tyson</b> at American University. Clinton's UN Ambassador <b>Madeline Albright</b> was the choice of Wellesley, Barnard, and the University of Michigan.  Defense Secretary <b>William Perry</b> spoke at Stanford University and Penn State, and NEA Chair <b>Jane Alexander</b> spoke at the University of Pennsylvania.
<p>
Other Clinton associates chosen include <b>Vernon Jordan</b> by Colgate, <b>Johnnetta Cole</b> by Oberlin, and <b>David Gergen</b> by Duke. Former Texas Governor <b>Ann Richards</b> spoke at Mount Holyoke.
<p>
Liberal activists were among those honored in this year's commencement exercises, including <b>Gloria Steinem</b> at Smith, Children's Defense Fund President <b>Marian Wright Edelman</b> at the University of Virginia and Occidental College, and Urban League official <b>Hugh Price</b> at George Washington.
<p>
Young America's Foundation's annual survey highlights an independently chosen list of highly selective colleges. The Leftist and pro-Clinton trends, however, are not exclusive to this group. The <i>New York Times</i> reported that the top four "Honored and Honored" choices found in its more comprehensive survey were: <B>Marian Wright Edelman</b> (seven honorary degrees or Commencement lectures), <b>Henry Louis Gates, Jr.</b> (six), <b>Bill Cosby</b> (six), and Donna Shalala (four). Commencement speakers at less selective schools also emphasized anti-Republican and pro-big government themes.
<p>
And a year-by-year comparison reinforces the bias. For example, the honored guests invited to George Washington University during the past three years included Donna Shalala ('93), <b>Hillary Clinton</b> ('94) and <b>Tom Foley</b> ('95) Yale honored <b>Jodie Foster</b> in 1993, <b>Sargent Shriver</b> in 1994 and Democrat Mayor Curt Schmoke in 1995. The University of Pennsylvania hosted Hillary Clinton (93), <b>Henry Cisneros</b> ('94), and Jane Alexander ('95).  Stanford's 1993 speaker was <b>Diane Feinstein</b>, 1994 speaker was <b>Stephen Carter</b>, and this year it was William Perry. Dartmouth chose <b>Bill Moyers</b> in 1993, Robert Reich in 1994.  Reich's boss Bill Clinton in 1995. Duke's last three speakers were Bill Bradley, Judy Woodruff, and David Gergen. Wellesley sticks with Liberal women: Gloria Steinem, <b>Cokie Roberts</b>, and Madeline Albright.
<p>
In a by-gone era college administrators were reluctant to have Leftists and Democrat politicians dominate their commencement exercises because parents, trustees, and donors were on hand. But in recent years those inhibitions vanished on most campuses. Clinton Administration officials, Liberal commentators, and elected Democrat officials are regularly given the honor of addressing the graduating seniors and their families.
<p>
This imbalance appears especially acute in a year when college students demonstrated their strong preference for conservative speakers when they were available. <b>Bill Bennett, William F. Buckley, Jr., P.J. O'Rourke, Oliver North, Margaret Thatcher</b>, and <b>General Colin Powell</b> drew standing room only crowds on many campuses during the school year. In nearly every case they spoke before much larger audiences than their liberal counter parts. In addition, in a year when revolutionary changes came to Capitol Hill, the major campuses' graduates didn't hear from a single member of the new Republican leadership.
<p>
Some Republicans and a couple of conservatives were among the speakers at the major campuses. Yet they are invariably former officials who are unlikely to champion a conservative position on today's cutting-edge issues in a manner comparable to that of the Democratic office-holders who are actively defending the Clinton Administration positions. President <b>George Bush</b> delivered the commencement address at William and Mary, <b>Marilyn Quayle</b> spoke at Rose Hulman Institute of Technology in Indiana, and Stanford Administrator <b>Condoleezza Rice</b> was honored at Notre Dame.
<p>
Harvard's Commencement speaker was Czech Republic President <b>Vaclav Havel</b>.
<p>
No conservative movement organization leader, free market academic, Reagan appointed jurist, or conservative religious leader, addressed any of the top schools' commencements. Outstanding speakers such as Nobel Laureate <b>Milton Friedman</b>, Stanford scholar <b>Thomas Sowell</b>, author Clancy, Rev. <b>Billy Graham</b>, Cardinal <B>John O'Connor</b>, General <B>Norman Schwarzkopf</b>, media commentators <b>George Will</b> and <B>Rush Limbaugh</b>, and House leaders <B>Newt Gingrich</b> and <B>Dick Armey</b>, were passed over for the likes of Gloria Steinem, Lynn Redgrave, Daniel Shorr, and back bench Democrat Congressmen!
<p>
Commencements this year looked more like one last dose of left-wing indoctrination than a fresh start for the graduates of the Class of '95.

Have you ever been in a 
     class and had your professor or a classmate go on and on expounding some 
liberal position?  Perhaps you wanted to challenge their arguments but 
were reluctant because you didn't have all the facts on hand.  
Young America's Foundation would like to help.
<P>The Foundation understands that conservative ideas are 
rarely mentioned in the classroom unless they are being distorted by a 
professor.  It is easy for students to come across the liberal 
arguments in their classes, in casual discussions, or in the campus paper.  
In order to learn about conservative ideas, however, students need 
to go out of the way, taking the initiative and doing their own research.  
<P>The Foundation recognizes that getting a balanced 
education <I>shouldn't </I>be such a time consuming project.  To help students 
learn about the <I>other </I>side of the argument, Young America's 
Foundation is continuing its series of &quot;issue briefs&quot; on the most 
controversial and hotly debated issues on campus.  
<P>The latest two issue briefs provide valuable information on 
the issues of Social Security privatization and reform of 
the student financial aid system.  These are two issues that should be 
of optimum concern to college-aged students.  With the 
information provided by these two briefs, you will be able to challenge 
liberal professors, misguided classmates, and slanted editorials.
<P>In addition to the &quot;Social Security&quot; and &quot;Financial Aid&quot; 
issue papers, the Foundation is still offering its brief covering 
&quot;Affirmative Action on Campus.&quot;  If you would like to receive copies of 
 these informative papers, please contact <B>Matthew Schenk 
</B>at Young America's Foundation at 1-800-292-9231.

<H3>Senator Wallop Joins Speaker Program</H3><BR>
Former United States Senator 
    <B>Malcolm Wallop </B>is now 
     available to defend freedom and liberty on your campus 
through the Foundation's speaker program. As a three-term Senator from 
Wyoming, Malcolm Wallop was a leader on various issues such 
asthe flat tax, federal deregulation, private property rights, and a 
strong national defense.

of private property rights.</I><BR>
</td></tr>
</table> 
<P>Having served on numerous congressional committees, 
Senator Wallop is an expert on many issues. He was the first to 
propose a space-based defense system in 1976. His efforts in 1981 led 
to cuts in inheritance and gift taxes. He is also knowledgeable on 
environmental issues. His latest effort has been to lead the fight 
against the Clinton Administration's &quot;War on the West.&quot;  Senator Wallop 
was successful in stopping the government's assault on 
Western mining, grazing, and water rights, seeing the government's efforts 
as an attempt to limit the rights of individuals and the states. 
<P>
Senator Wallop has written for a number of distinguished 
publications, such as <I>National Review, </I>the<I> Economist, U.S. News 
and World Report,</I> the <I>American 
Spectator</I>, the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>,  
and the <I>New York Times</I>. The Senator has appeared on many 
television programs such as <I>Nightline, </I>the 
<I>Today Show, CBS Morning News</I>, and the <I>McNeil-Lehrer News Hour.</I>
<P>Currently, he is Chairman of Frontiers of Freedom, a 
non-profit organization dedicated to the promotion of personal freedom 
and the reduction of federal fiscal and regulatory powers. He 
recently advocated reforming the Endangered Species Act and 
privatizing Social Security.  Senator Wallop continues to be a Wyoming 
rancher and businessman.

Mr. Eastland offers a 
compelling criticism of race-based quotas and rigged admissions 
policies.  He argues that the true test of a democracy is its adherence 
to colorblindness. 
<P>Mr. Eastland is editor of <I>Forbes 
MediaCritic</I> and a fellow at the <BR>
Ethics and Public Policy Center in Washington, D.C.  He is a 
leading authority on Supreme Court decisions concerning not only race 
but also religious freedom.  His research and experience give him 
a unique perspective on the impact of affirmative action.

in memory of the entrepreneur, <B>Grover 
Hermann</B>.  As founder of American Asphalt Company 
and chairman of the board of Martin Marietta Corporation until 
his death in 1979, Mr. Hermann was remembered as a man who 
generously contributed both his time and fortune to many 
philanthropies.

<H3>Are There &quot;Screwballs, Devil Dames, and 
Closet Cases&quot; in Your College's Curriculum?</H3>
Young America's Founda
          tion has just completed the 
          second edition of <I>Comedy and Tragedy:  College Course 
Descriptions and What They Tell Us About Higher Education 
Today</I>.
<P>This edition examines courses from fifty national 
universities and liberal arts colleges and concludes that bizarre 
and trendy courses have infiltrated every facet of higher 
education.
<P>To many, courses such as Harvard's &quot;A Thousand 
Feminisms,&quot; De Paul's &quot;Sociology of Rock Music,&quot; 
and Amherst's &quot;Black English&quot; are 
merely amusing, but college students understand that the 
product of this kind of frivolous, &quot;multicultural&quot; curriculum is 
an inferior education and poor preparation for the job market.
<P>Parents, taxpayers, concerned educators, and prospective employers should also be troubled 
by this tragedy in American higher education.  Due to this 
obsession with multiculturalism and &quot;victim studies,&quot; an entire generation 
of students is being ill-prepared for life in the real world.
<P><I>Comedy and Tragedy </I>reveals that courses such as 
&quot;Sorcery and Magic,&quot; and &quot;Sex and Gender on Film: 
Screwballs, Devil Dames, and Closet Cases,&quot; are just the tip of 
the iceberg.  
<P>

college curriculum, contact <B>Dede Hamilton </B>at 1-800-292-9231. <HR>

<a name="monopoly"><center><h3>Fight the Liberal Monoply on Your Campus<br></h3></center></a>

Most American college campuses are in desperate need of reform.  At a time when      the American people are rejecting big government and the whole world is rejecting socialism, most campus economics and political science departments still cling to the failed policies of  Marxism.  Speech codes, designed to silence politically incorrect views, are in effect at hundreds of colleges and universities.  Campus curricula is overwhelmingly slanted to the left in virtually every subject, as victim-studies courses have crowded out more traditional offerings in many fields.  Faculty and administrators almost exclusively reserve guest lecture invitations to radical Leftists.  If students wish to bring conservative or free market speakers to their campuses, they must do so on their own.
<P>There is much at stake here.  If Leftist ideas are allowed to go unchallenged on campus, then they alone will influence and educate our nation's future leaders.  Your professors and administrators--the radicals and rabble-rousers of the 1960s--are not likely to promote traditional and free market ideas.  It is the students who are the greatest hope for reforming this imbalance.
<P>If you are a student on today's campus, you are at the very point of conflict in a cultural and intellectual war to determine the future of American society.  You, your children, and your grandchildren will live in a country substantially impacted by the outcome of that struggle.
<P>Young America's Foundation is here to help you in this struggle.  We provide the resources that can help you balance the campus debate.  In addition to our extensive campus lecture program, we also can provide you with advice on how to become a more effective campus reformer.  An informative guide, entitled <B><I>A Student Strategy for Campus Reform</B></I>, has recently been published by Young America's Foundation.  In this guide, you will find advice on how to form a campus organization, obtain funding for speakers and activities, inform sympathetic alumni of your efforts, and get coverage from campus and local media.
<P>In reforming your campus, you are not only doing a great service for your fellow students and your country, but you are also developing skills and connections that will benefit you for years to come.  You could have the opportunity to meet public figures and personalities such as <B>William F. Buckley, Jr., Walter Williams</B>, and <B>Margaret Thatcher </B>when you arrange for them to lecture at your campus.  Your group may even be featured by the local newspaper or even in the national media if your campaign attracts public attention, as has been the case with 
many students who undertake the goal of campus reform.
<P>If you would like to receive the <B><I>Student Strategy for Campus 
Reform</B></I>, or if you would like any information on the many other programs offered by Young America's Foundation, please call 1-800-292-9231.

<center><a name="medved"><h3>Film Critic Michael Medved<BR> Selected as 1995-96<BR>
Grover Hermann Freedom Lecturer</h3>[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]</center><P>
Film critic <b>Michael Medved</b> will be featured as this year's <B>Grover Hermann Freedom Lecturer</b>. As the co-host of Sneak Previews and the chief film critic for The New York Post, Mr. Medved is an authority in the debate over cultural values and the role that Hollywood plays in influencing them. Most recently, he has appeared as a guest host on the Rush Limbaugh Radio Show.
<p>
As a best-selling author and nationally recognized television personality, Mr. Medved has been featured in numerous televised debates concerning the negative impact of the entertainment industry. His most indelible contribution to this subject, however, is his book Hollywood vs. America. Speaking at the Foundation' s 1995 Summer Conference, Mr. Medved noted that Senator Robert Dole, in making his highly publicized speech denouncing the film, television, and music industries, drew much of his theme from <B><I>Hollywood vs. America</B></I>. "Senator Dole had a copy of my book on the podium, somewhat visible," Mr. Medved noted, "and I do know that he quoted four sentences from my book more or less verbatim. . . and he even acknowledged one of them. . . which I was very pleased to see."
<p>
Michael Medved is also the author of several other books, including <b><I>The Shadow Presidents, Hospital: The Hidden Lives of a Medical Center Staff</B></I?, and <B><I>What Really Happened to the Class of '65?</b></I>, which served as the basis for an NBC television series. He is also a member of the Writer' s Guild of America and has worked as a screenwriter on several major studio film projects.
<p>
The Grover Hermann Freedom Lecture Series was named in memory of philanthropist and entrepreneur, Grover Hermann. Mr. Hermann's career has been described as an "old-fashioned, free enterprise success story." In 1913, at age 23, he used a $5,000 investment to start the American Asphalt Company, which he expanded over the years into a large, diversified nationwide corporation.
<p>
Mr. Hermann's business, renamed American Marietta Company in the early 1930's, ultimately merged with the Martin Company in 1961 to form Martin Marietta Corporation for which he served as chairman of the board. At the time of his death in 1979, Mr. Hermann was remembered not only as a great entrepreneur and businessman, but also as a man who generously contributed both time and fortune to many philanthropies.
<p>
To find out how you may submit a proposal to bring Mr. Medved to speak at your campus, please call <b>Michelle Sharp</b> at 1-800-292-9231.


<p><p><hr><center><a name="document"><h3>Document Leftist Bias on Your Campus!</h3></a>[ <a href="#contents">Contents </a>]</center>
<p>
When was the last time you heard a conservative lecturer speak on your campus? If you can't remember, chances are your college is like most others, in that an endless stream of liberals are paraded onto campus, all warmly embraced by college faculty and administrators, while no effort is made to bring in traditional or free market ideas.
<p>
What can you do to turn this tide and hold your college accountable for providing educational balance? One way is to document just how one-sided the campus debate is by researching the speakers your college has sponsored recently.
<p>
Students at Swarthmore College combed through the archives of the campus newspaper, and discovered that in the past four years not one conservative had been featured as a guest lecturer. During that same period, dozens of radical liberals were sponsored by the college, including a former leader of the Black Panthers, politicians such as Lenora Fulani and Michael Dukakis, and no less than 15 "experts" on multiculturalism and homosexual issues. With this information, these students were able to convince the college to help bring in Young America's Foundation speakers <b>William Buckley, Star Parker, Michael Medved, Walter Williams, </b>and<b> Dinesh D'Souza</b>.
<p>
Students at Appalachian State University went even farther, going back eight years and totaling exactly how much money was spent to bring in speakers such as Abbie Hoffman, Molly Yard, Maya Angelou, and Ralph Nader. After they were finished with their research, the front-page headline in the next issue of their student paper read: "Liberal Speakers - $242,000; Conservative Speakers - $0."
<p>
Ask your campus' speaker selection committee for a list of past guest lecturers, or look back through past issues of the school newspaper to find out who your campus has been sponsoring. Once you have your results, publicize them by notifying local newspapers and radio talk shows. Send a letter to sympathetic alumni, letting them know what speakers your college has been endorsing.
<p>
The next step is to use the information as a leveraging point to get the college administration and speakers committee to help you bring in alternative speakers. Every college that has done this kind of research in the past has achieved great success in sponsoring conservative lecturers.
<p>
After you have documented the bias and made the case for balancing your college's lecture program, contact Young America's Foundation and we can help you sponsor a speaker on your campus.

What College Course Descriptions Tell Us<br>
About Higher Education</h3></a>[ <a href="#contents">Contents</a> ]</center><p>
<b>Comedy and Tragedy: College Course Descriptions and What They Tell Us About Higher Education Today</b> is a survey published by Young America's Foundation documenting the decay of academic standards in the classes offered at our nation's top colleges and universities. Young America's Foundation found that a disturbingly high number of classes propagate ideology (including feminism, anti-Americanism, and Marxism), and not education.
<p>
Such classes as Yale's "Drag Queens, Transsexuals, and Queers:  Anthropological Approaches," Harvard's "Perceptions of the Supernatural: Witches, Werewolves, and Ouija Boards," and Columbia's "Race, Gender, and the Politics of Rock 'n' Roll" are among the hundreds of bizarre courses listed.
<p>
While <i>Comedy and Tragedy</I> is not for sale, students can obtain copies of the report by sending Young America's Foundation at least five politically correct courses offered by your school. Though not every school offers titles as bizarre as the University of Michigan's "Lesbian Literature" or SUNY-Albany's "Society's Nightmare: Images of Gender, Race, and Class in Horror Film," we are confident that you can add to the list of questionable courses.
<p>
If you wish to receive <i>Comedy and Tragedy</I>, send the aforementioned information to <b>Dan Flynn</b> at Young America's Foundation, 110 Elden Street, Herndon, VA 22070. Make sure to note the department in which the courses you list are offered and the full description that appears in your school's course catalogue.

It is time to begin planning which speakers you will bring to your campus this fall. Young America's Foundation's 1995-96 speakers program booklet features not only prominent leaders of the conservative movement who are available to speak on your campus, but also includes crucial information on how to host a successful event.<P>

Last year the Foundation sponsored speakers such as <b>Margaret Thatcher, Walter Williams</b>, and <b>Dan Quayle</b> on campuses across the country. New additions to the speakers booklet this year include <b>G. Gordon Liddy, Ralph Reed, P.J. O'Rourke, Marilyn Quayle</b>, and <i>USA Today's</i> <b>Tony Snow</b>.

<p>
Concerned about finding a job when you graduate? It's tough out there for a couple of reasons, and they might surprise you. Big government and political correctness are a graduate's main adversaries. Over-regulation of every type of industry combined with the diminishing regard corporate leaders have for today's college degrees are dramatically impacting recent college graduates' ability to find employment.
<P>Through the Foundation program, <i>Job Prospects for College Graduates: What's the Problem?</i>, free market economists and corporate leaders will speak to students on these critical issues, giving students the insights they need for maximizing their educational opportunities and avoiding the pitfalls of a useless degree. <p>
Students who participate in our program will gain a unique understanding of the job market and of the qualities employers are seeking in new recruits.
<P>Young America's 
Foundation will work with you in developing a program which will meet the needs of your campus. We will provide literature, including <b><i>Job Prospects for College Graduates: The Role of Government</i></b> and <b><i>The Responsibilities of the University</i></b>, a monograph written by economics professor <b>Thomas J. DiLorenzo</b> and published by Young America's Foundation. We will also assist you in bringing a corporate leader and free market scholar to your school. If you are interested in participating in this Foundation program, please call <b>Kate Griffin</b> at 1-800-292-9231.

Just like Jason from "Friday the 
13th" or "A Nightmare on Elm Street's" Freddy Kreuger, the <b>National Standards for History</b> is a monstrosity that refuses to die.
<P>A product of the Goals 2000 
project, strongly endorsed by President Clinton, the Standard s met with widespread criticism when they were first released last year. Blasted for their politically correct revisionism and strong anti-Western bias, it appeared that the Standards had been completely defeated, especially after the U.S. Senate voted 99-1 to condemn them.<P>
In February, however, the National Center for History in the Schools, the group based out of UCLA that created the Standards, redoubled its efforts to inject the flawed curriculum into grade schools and high schools across the country. The Center produced a slick brochure showcasing the National Standards, attempting to market them directly to school districts. The debate is clearly far from being over.<P>
In response to this attempt, Continuity, the history journal published by Young America's Foundation, asked eleven of the country's most respected history scholars to assess the Standards based on their historical merit.<P>
The result is the most in-depth, fact-based criticism of the Standards to date. This special issue of <I>Continuity</i> will give you all the ammunition you need to discuss or debate the National Standards with your professors or classmates.<P>
If you would like to receive a free copy of <I>Continuity</I>, please call 1800-292-9231.



<p><p><hr><center><a name="last word"><h3>Don't Let the Liberals Have the Last Word!</h3></a>[ <a href="#contents">Contents </a>]</center>
<p>Have you ever been in a class and had your professor or a classmate go on and on expounding some liberal position? Perhaps you wanted to challenge their arguments but were reluctant because you didn't have all the facts on hand. Young America's Foundation would like to help.
<P>We understand that 
conservatives are overwhelmingly outnumbered on campuses, and that conservative ideas are rarely mentioned in the classroom unless they are being distorted by a professor. It is easy for students to come across the liberal arguments in their classes, in casual discussions, or in the campus paper. In order to learn about conservative ideas, however, students need to go out of their way, doing their own research and taking the initiative. Achieving philosophical balance in higher education can be a very time consuming project.
<P>To help students learn about the other side of the argument, Young America's Foundation is compiling and will distribute "issue briefs" on the most controversial and hotly debated issues on campus. The Foundation's issue briefs will assist you in learning the conservative side of the argument. With the information provided by them, you will be able to challenge liberal professors, misguided classmates, and slanted editorials.<P>
The first issue brief will deal with the liberal policy of affirmative action and will be available within the first weeks of the school year. If you would like to be put on the mailing list to receive these briefs, or if you would like to suggest a topic for a future issue brief, please contact <B>Matthew Schenk</b> at Young America's Foundation at 1-800-292-9231.

Young America's Foundation is 
proud to announce its newest lecture program: the <b>William Casey Lecture Series</b>. Named in honor of the late <b>William Casey</b>, who served under Ronald Reagan as the director of the C.I.A. from 1981-86, the Casey Lecture Series will feature author <b>Peter Schweizer</b> as its inaugural speaker.
<P>Mr. Schweizer is the author of several books, including Friendly Spies, and Victory: The Reagan Administration's Secret Strategy that Hastened the Collapse of the Soviet Union. In Victory, Mr. Schweizer uncovered previously unpublished information revealing that the United States' victory in the Cold War was a direct result of actions taken by the Reagan Administration. The main architect of this strategy, Schweizer's research revealed, was C.I.A. Director Casey. Mr. Schweizer has been active with Young America' s Foundation since a student in high school, and served as its academic director from 1991 to 1994.
<P>A true American hero, William Casey not only headed the C.I.A. and directly helped to bring about the collapse of communism, but he also served as the manager of Ronald Reagan's 1980 presidential campaign.
<P>To have Mr. Schweizer speak at your campus, please contact <b>Michelle Sharp</b> at 1-800-292-9231.

<b>Newt Gingrich, Jack Kemp, Robert Novak, Fred Barnes, Walter Williams, Dinesh D'Souza, Ralph Reed, Michael Medved, Trent Lott, Sonny Bono</b>, and <b>Oliver North</b> have a lot in common.

These individuals, among others, recently addressed the 17th annual National Conservative Student Conference.
<P>Four hundred activists from campuses nationwide convened from July 23 to 29 in Washington D C. for the most comprehensive conservative conference available to students. The Summer Conference taught student leaders from hundreds of colleges and universities how to become more effective campus activists and exposed them to lectures by leaders of national prominence. Each summer, Young America's Foundation hosts the National Conservative Student Conference to help balance students' increasingly liberal education.
<P>If you missed out on 
attending this once-in-a-lifetime event, you still have an opportunity to benefit from the lectures and advice given by the nation's most influential leaders. Audio tapes of all lectures are available for $10 apiece. You may also purchase a set of six for $58, or the entire set of 33 lectures for only $310.

</center>
<p>
Young America's Foundation is pleased to announce that G. Gordon Liddy, P.J. O'Rourke, Tony Snow, 
and Marilyn Tucker Quayle have joined its speakers program.<p>

<b>G. Gordon Liddy</b> is the host of the hottest talk show in national syndication. He has firmly established himself as one of the most intelligent and engaging voices in the country. His triumphant return to the nation's capital also illustrates the significance of his central message: the importance of striving to prevail where others simply survive, whatever your field of endeavor.<p>

<b>P.J. O'Rourke</b> is called "the funniest writer in America" by the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>. At the lecture podium he never fails to inform and entertain, whether he is dealing with the state of the nation, the issues that shape our contemporary world, or the hilariously serious people who 
pontificate about them.<p>

<b>Marilyn Quayle</b>, wife of former Vice President Dan Quayle, is a partner in an Indianapolis law firm where she practices general corporate law, specializing in mergers and acquisitions, international, and health care law. During her husband's tenure as vice president, Mrs. Quayle served on the board of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. She was also chairman of the International Disaster Advisory Committee for the Agency for International Development. She continues to work with the National Cancer Institute as the national spokesman for NCI's Breast Cancer Summits.<p>

<b>Tony Snow</b> is a nationally syndicated columnist for the Detroit News and counterpoint columnist for <i>USA Today</i>. His editorials appear in various mediums around the world. He works as a commentator on National Public Radio and as a permanent guest-host on Rush Limbaugh's radio program. He is also a regular contributor to such television shows as <i>The McLaughlin Group, The McNeil-Lehrer News Hour, Good Morning America, Face the Nation</i>, and <i>Crossfire</i>.<p>

</center>
<p>
Fresh from Oliver North's exhilarating senatorial campaign where he served as director of the Virginia Finance Committee, <b>Marc Short</b> returns to Young America's Foundation as national director. Marc originally joined the Foundation as national director after graduating from Washington and Lee University in 1992. He will oversee the Foundation's 17th annual summer conference and explore new opportunities organizing regional conferences.<p>

<b>Kate Obenshain Griffln</b> concluded her tenure as Governor George Allen's special assistant for policy development and returned to the Foundation as director of program development. In 1991, after graduating from the University of Virginia, Kate became the Foundation's lecture director. She left the Foundation in the summer of 1993 to join Allen's gubernatorial campaign. After the election, she went to work for Governor Allen, focusing on education and health policy.<p>

In the midst of his high-profile Supreme Court case against the University of Virginia, <b>Ron Rosenberger</b> joins the Foundation as a program officer. Ron served as an intern at the Foundation while a student at the University of Virginia. As a campus activist at UVa, Ron founded a publication which was denied student activities funds on the basis of it being a "religious activity."  Ron filed suit against UVa and his case is currently before the Supreme Court. Ron was active with Young America's Foundation while at UVa, bringing prominent conservative speakers such as Edwin Meese and Dinesh D'Souza to campus.

<p>
Foundation Program Officer <b>Ron Rosenberger's</b> run-in with University of Virginia officials is a prime example of a disturbing trend: an alarming increase of flagrant discrimination against religious students and faculty members on campuses. In Ron's case, UVa denied his magazine, Wide Awake, funding, asserting that it was a religious activity advocating an "avowedly Christian" perspective. However, UVa had already funded the Muslim Students Association and Jewish Law Students Association. Young America's Foundation is currently conducting research on such discrimination. If you have experienced discrimination or intimidation first-hand, or are aware of examples on your campus, please call Ron Rosenberger at the Foundation: 1-800-292-9231.

<p>

The Family Research Council is a nonprofit, nonpartisan educational 
organization operating under the provision of Section 501C-3 of the 
Internal Revenue Code.  It was originally founded in 1983, merged 
with Focus on the Family from 1988-1992, then reorganized as a separate 
501C-3 and incorporated as such in the District of Columbia in October 
1992.  The Council is supported by voluntary donations and grants.  The 
bulk of its contributions are received from individuals.  Donations to 
FRC are tax-deductible.
<P>
The Family Research Council exists to reaffirm and promote nationally, 
and particularly in Washington, DC,  the traditional family unit and 
the Judeo-Christian value system upon which it is built.
<P>
To accomplish this task, the Council will:
<P>

<UL>
<li>Promote and defend traditional family values in print, broadcast and 
other media outlets.
<li>Develop and advocate legislative and public policy initiatives 
which strengthen and fortify the family and promote traditional values.
<li>Establish and maintain an accurate source of statistical and 
research information which reaffirms the importance of the family in our 
civilization.
<li>Inform and educate citizens on how they can promote Biblical 
principles in our culture.
</UL>

<P>

In Washington, D.C., a city often estranged from heart and home, the 
Family Research Council is an unparalleled organization which focuses 
its efforts solely on defending the interests of the American Family. 
FRC provides an alternative voice in the media -- a voice for the family 
and family values.  A unique and multi-faceted team has united to meet 
these challenges.

<p>

For more details about FRC's stance on issues that affect the family, 
make sure to read our <a href="/townhall/FRC/faq/">FAQ (Frequently 
Asked Questions) List</a>.

<h3>The Rule of Law In Hong Kong In the Run-Up to 1997 and Beyond</h3>

By Daniel R. Fung, Q.C., J.P.<br>
January 30, 1996
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
It is a rare privilege and a real pleasure for me personally to be asked to address you today. I am honored to see before me a galaxy of experts not just on Hong Kong and China issues specifically, but also on East Asian affairs in general. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
May I begin by briefly outlining the duties and powers of my present office. Next I shall proceed to canvass what we as a government have done to entrench the rule of law in Hong Kong, after which I will talk about the inculcation in our community of legal culture and human rights values. Finally, I will address the question foremost on everyone's minds and offer a prognosis as to whether the foregoing legal and cultural construct will survive the transition to Chinese sovereignty. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The office of Solicitor General for Hong Kong differs substantially from that of my counterpart in the United States federal government. While your Solicitor General acts as the government's principal advocate responsible for determining which issues warrant determination in the United States Supreme Court and the federal Appeals Courts, my portfolio covers the Hong Kong government's legal policy. In the context of the run-up to 1997 and beyond, my brief is to ensure that Hong Kong's legal system remains true to the spirit of the common law before as well as after the reversion to Chinese sovereignty. I carry also a number of sub-portfolios, including the legal protection of human rights, constitutional and electoral law, the law of the People's Republic of China (in terms of advising my government on PRC law as well as monitoring its growth and development), and, finally, law reform in Hong Kong.
<p>
<b>HONG KONG'S COMMON LAW HERITAGE</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The common law is arguably Britain's greatest and proudest legacy bequeathed to Hong Kong. We are poised to emerge from just over a century-and-a-half of British rule. As a direct result, we enjoy a legal system which is based on the doctrine of case precedent, or <I>stare decisis</I>. The way the common law operates is illustrated in the immortal words of one legal commentator who observed that it "stands as a monument slowly raised, like a coral reef, from the minute accretions of past individuals, of whom each built upon the relics which his predecessors left, and in turn left a foundation upon which his successors might work." 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The growth and development of the common law depends on input from and cross-fertilization with other common law jurisdictions. No common law system can, by definition, survive in a vacuum. Accordingly, we cite in our courts on a regular, if not actually daily, basis decisions not merely of our own jurisdiction, but also those of the House of Lords in England, the Privy Council, the High Court of Australia, the Court of Appeal in New Zealand, the Supreme Court of Canada, and last, but by no means least, the United States Supreme Court and the United States Appeals Courts, to pick but a few prominent examples from the extensive reach of the common law patrimony. The continuation of this system is guaranteed both by international treaty (the Sino-British Joint Declaration) and by constitutional provisions (the Basic Law), which form the twin cornerstones of our future legal edifice. Hong Kong will remain locked into the international grid as a member of the common law family, wherefore, after 1997, we will continue to cite in our courts in appropriate cases the decisions of your superior courts.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The provisions girding our future have been erected and can be viewed structurally at a number of different levels, at the international legal or treaty level as well as at the domestic constitutional level. Before we embark on this survey, we should remind ourselves that Hong Kong's transition towards resumption of the exercise of Chinese sovereignty has been an extremely long one. Our odyssey began over 12 years ago, at the end of 1984, when the treaty known as the Sino-British Joint Declaration was signed between the outgoing and the incoming sovereign powers. It will be complete on June 30, 1997. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
We have entered the last 500 days of this long journey. We have reached, in other words, the home stretch of our unique thirteen-and-a-half year marathon. Such a long transition holds certain advantages. It allows us periodically to pause and take stock of our progress, to look back over the long road down which we have travelled. And when we undertake this retrospective, we see four major milestones which mark, like rites of passage, our oftimes arduous trek towards resumption of the exercise of Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong. These milestones can be represented temporally by the years 1984, 1990, 1991 and 1995.
<p>
<b>THE SINO-BRITISH JOINT DECLARATION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Our story begins in 1984. In that annus mirabilis, the People's Republic of China and the United Kingdom, following two years of hard negotiations inaugurated in 1982 by British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's visit to Beijing, entered into a solemn agreement known as the Sino-British Joint Declaration (the Joint Declaration). The Joint Declaration is a bilateral treaty enforceable under international law and registered with the United Nations. It binds the outgoing sovereign, Britain, on the one hand into transferring sovereignty over Hong Kong to China, subject to certain specified conditions and safeguards, and the incoming sovereign, China, on the other, upon resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997, into giving her people "a high degree autonomy" under Deng Xiaoping's famous twin dicta "One Country,Two Systems" and "Hong Kong People Ruling Hong Kong."
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Save only in respect of defense and foreign affairs, Hong Kong after 1997 will be designated a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China and be self-governing. In short, it will be self-governing at least to the same extent as it is self-governing today. As I shall endeavor to demonstrate later, in certain specific areas, Hong Kong will actually enjoy a degree of autonomy after 1997 even higher than that which it enjoys today.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Under the Joint Declaration, Hong Kong will maintain her present freedoms and lifestyle as well as her own political, economic, social, cultural, legal, and judicial systems fundamentally different and separate from those of the rest of China. Capitalism will continue to be practiced as the order of the day. Socialism as state policy will not be applied. We will maintain our own currency, the Hong Kong dollar: a hard currency, freely convertible, a tool of international trade, different from the <I>renminbi</I>, pegged to the U.S. dollar, and backed up by US$49 billion of reserves. Hong Kong will remain a separate customs territory. We will remain a separate fiscal area and a tax haven. No taxes will be remitted to the Central People's Government. We will practice fiscal conservatism and expend strictly within the limits of our revenue income. We will keep our own shipping and aircraft registers. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Hong Kong will maintain its own international persona separate from the rest of China. For example, we are a founder-member of the World Trade Organization (WTO). China is not. Hong Kong will retain its status in the WTO post-1997, whether or not China becomes a member of that body. We are a member of the Asia-Pacific Economic Council (APEC), sitting alongside China in that forum. After 1997, we will retain our seat on APEC. We will continue to participate at international activities and conferences under a new name, Hong Kong China. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Last but not least, the Joint Declaration specifically provides for our existing legal system to survive unchanged. In particular, it provides for the common law to continue to be applied. Hong Kong will maintain her own legal system based on the common law, which will be quarantined from that of the rest of China. PRC laws will not be applied in Hong Kong. We will have our own self-contained judicial system with the ability to exercise, for the first time in our history, power of final adjudication. Our very own Court of Final Appeal will be established in Hong Kong on July 1, 1997, to replace the Privy Council in London as the ultimate arbiter of disputes within the Special Administrative Region. No PRC court will occupy such a position. There will be no overarching supreme court established to oversee the operations of the Court of Final Appeal.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The implications of the Joint Declaration are far-reaching. It adumbrates the beginnings of an experiment by the PRC with a form of government that has gone way beyond the federal model. No federal state of which I am aware would tolerate a similar degree of separateness or autonomy on the part of any one region within the same country.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Joint Declaration is striking in yet another respect: It contains an annex. By Annex I to the Joint Declaration, a document longer than the Joint Declaration itself but which forms part and parcel of the treaty and is also registered with the United Nations, the People's Republic of China commits to writing its basic policies governing Hong Kong after 1997. It fleshes out the provisions of the Joint Declaration proper and reiterates, among other matters, the separateness of Hong Kong's legal and judicial systems from those of the mainland and the continued application of the common law to Hong Kong with all that that implies. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In Part XIII of Annex I, the People's Republic of China made plain that the provisions of the two principal international human rights covenants sponsored by the United Nations -- namely, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) -- which have been applied to Hong Kong since 1976 will continue to be applied to Hong Kong post-1997. And that is not all. In the context of fundamental common law doctrine that international legal and treaty rights and obligations do not automatically become justifiable domestically, China also made plain that those international legal provisions will be enforceable domestically in Hong Kong through Hong Kong law. And this is so despite the fact that China is not yet a signatory to either multilateral treaty.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Finally, the Joint Declaration is remarkable in yet another respect: It obliges the People's Republic of China to reduce its stated policies and treaty obligations to an enforceable domestic form. In other words, it obliges China to enact a future mini-constitution for Hong Kong. This has now become a reality. The Joint Declaration was signed in December 1984, and was ratified by the U.K. Parliament in May 1985. In mid-1985, an unprecedented process of drafting the Basic Law in consultation with the people of Hong Kong commenced and lasted for five years until April of 1990, when the process was complete and the Basic Law promulgated. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This was an unprecedented exercise in both the Chinese and Hong Kong context. Unprecedented in the Chinese context since they have never before drafted a constitution for a particular region about to be incorporated into the country. Unprecedented in the Hong Kong context because we have never before possessed a comprehensive written constitution: Our closest present equivalent to a written constitution are the Letters Patent, cast in general terms, which constitute instructions from Her Majesty the Queen to the Governor. Unprecedented also by reason of the open manner in which the exercise was carried out: It embraced people from all walks of life, both expert and non-expert, lawyers as well as laymen. The process was carried out by two committees -- the Basic Law Drafting Committee and the Basic Law Consultative Committee. The Basic Law Consultative Committee comprised exclusively Hong Kong persons; the Basic Law Drafting Committee comprised partly mainland and partly Hong Kong members. Wearing a different hat as a practicing member of the private bar (as I then was), I participated in that process as a member of the Consultative Committee.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Hong Kong's Future Mini-Constitution: The Basic Law. As a result of that exercise, a 160-article mini-constitution was promulgated in April 1990. Article 8 of the Basic Law makes it plain that the pre-existing legal system -- that is to say, the common law, rules of equity, pre-existing legislation, subsidiary legislation, customary law -- will all be preserved post-1997, save only for those which contravene the mini-constitution. In Chapter 3 of the Basic Law, 19 articles are set out, and they lay down specific and discrete guarantees of human rights protections in specific areas. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
One article among the 19 stands head and shoulders above the rest. It is more pregnant with meaning than the rest. That is Article 39. It provides that the provisions of the two international human rights covenants, the ICCPR and ICESCR, will continue to apply to Hong Kong through the laws of Hong Kong. The Basic Law realizes the promises and guarantees made in the Joint Declaration at the domestic level. It will be enforceable as law interpreted by our courts, and challenges can be made in accordance with our system of common law challenges.
<p>
<b>HONG KONG'S BILL OF RIGHTS </b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The third milestone along the road to Chinese sovereignty is 1991. In 1991, we enacted for the first time a bill of rights. Those of you who are familiar with British constitutional history and development will appreciate that written constitutions and written bills of rights were and, to a certain extent, still are regarded as anathema by traditionalists in the United Kingdom. That attitude stems historically from the fact that England, as the <I>fons et origo</I> of the common law, considered the system of practices, conventions, and case law constituting the common law to be so ingrained and entrenched in their psyche and culture that there was no need for that body of jurisprudence to be reduced to a comprehensive written form. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In other words, the proposition was "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."  This philosophy, if it ever gained currency within metropolitan soil, translates less happily to dependent territories because it is supposed, with some justification, that the common law enjoys a degree of entrenchment and impregnation into the psyche of dependency communities altogether more shallow than that of the mother country. That is why one finds that, as dependent territories evolve away from the colonial mold to a state of either independence (the standard model) or subsumption under a different sovereignty (in the case of Hong Kong), they have invariably been given written constitutions with bills of rights incorporated. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The same approach was taken in Hong Kong's case when we as a government sponsored and enacted a bill of rights after a gestation period of four-and-a-half years which commenced in 1987. Again, wearing a different hat as a practicing member of the private bar, I played a small role in that process. Hong Kong's Bill of Rights is unique in more senses than one. Unique since we have never had a bill of rights before. Unique also because we have replicated in our Bill almost verbatim the exact same provisions of the ICCPR. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Of the 130-odd countries around the world which have acceded to the international covenant, we are unique in being the only place that has domesticated those provisions. Our continuing dialogue with the United Nations Human Rights Committee and other U.N. agencies dealing with human rights reveals that no other country or territory has ever done so. Being an international covenant, it is free of so-called Asian values. We have a unique, universalist, culturally bias-free Bill of Rights.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Our Bill of Rights is interesting in another respect, inasmuch as we have lifted the provisions of the ICCPR and placed them in a common law context. Being a common law jurisdiction, we regularly interpret the provisions of our Bill of Rights and amplify, explain, interpolate, and extrapolate from those provisions so as to render the Bill a living body of jurisprudence instead of merely a piece of paper expressing platitudes. In the course of interpretation, we rely on decisions from other common law jurisdictions, including those I have previously mentioned such as the House of Lords in England, the Privy Council, the High Court of Australia, the New Zealand Court of Appeal, the U.S. Supreme Court, the Supreme Court of Canada, and the Supreme Court of India. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Additionally, we have gone beyond the common law world. We have looked at the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights, as well as those of the U.N. Human Rights Committee, in coming to our own conclusions. Over the four-and-a-half years since the passage of the Bill of Rights, we have built up a sizeable corpus of jurisprudence which renders meaningful and real the provisions of the Bill. Our body of case law is home-grown, yet saturated with international learning. It is a unique synthesis of local and international common as well as non-common law jurisprudence. I have it on good authority that our experiment is looked upon with great interest by many other common law as well as non-common law jurisdictions around the world.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Before I leave this subject, it is important to bear in mind that our Bill of Rights dovetails neatly with both the international treaty, the Joint Declaration, and our future mini-constitutional law, the Basic Law. Bearing in mind that both the Joint Declaration and Article 39 of the Basic Law provide for the provisions of the international covenants being applied and enforceable through the laws of Hong Kong, our Bill of Rights realizes that promise. It has actually completed the task of domesticating those provisions. The Hong Kong Bill of Rights constitutes, in essence, a domestic amplification of the corresponding mini-constitutional and international treaty provisions.
<p>
<b>HONG KONG'S COURT OF FINAL APPEAL STATUTE</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Last year we passed the last milestone. 1995 was the date when the Court of Final Appeal Ordinance was enacted by a landslide vote of our legislature. It makes our judicial system complete and repatriates our court of last resort to Hong Kong in the form of the Court of Final Appeal, replacing the Privy Council in London. The significance of this development cannot be overestimated, because we have hitherto always had the Privy Council in London as our court of last resort. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Between 1982 and 1984, the solution to this particular conundrum was much debated in the course of Sino-British dialogue over the future of Hong Kong. One obvious and logical solution placed on the agenda was "mirror-imaging," which would require replacing the Privy Council in London with a Court of Final Appeal in Beijing after 1997. However, after two years of hard negotiations, the architects of the Joint Declaration -- both Britain and China -- are to be congratulated in arriving at a uniquely Hong Kong solution to a Hong Kong problem, which is to establish the Court of Final Appeal as a common law court physically located in Hong Kong as opposed to Beijing.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Court of Final Appeal has five seats. Led by the Chief Justice, it comprises three other permanent appointees, with the fifth slot being filled on invitation, on an ambulatory and ad hoc basis, by invitees selected from one of two panels, a panel of local jurists and a panel of overseas jurists. Such invitation may be made as the nature of the case may require so that if, say, a maritime dispute were on the agenda, an Admiralty expert may be invited from London to assist the court. In terms of membership of the court, the overriding consideration is that all the members must be common lawyers. No PRC judge would be admitted. On the overseas panel, we expect to have eminent common law jurists from all over the world. I suppose if we should be lucky enough, we might have one or more justices, either serving or retired, of the U.S. Supreme Court sitting on that panel. We would almost certainly have members of the House of Lords, as well as Privy Councillors from the Antipodes, sitting on the overseas panel.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
So far as concerns the permanent appointees, there is no nationality requirement, save only for the Chief Justice, who must be a Hong Kong Chinese individual with no foreign nationality. The other three permanent appointees need not be Chinese nationals at all, and if the present composition of our Court of Appeal should offer any guide, I would anticipate the majority of the Court of Final Appeal judges to be non-nationals. Of all countries in the world, only China has allowed for such an open system. I know of no other jurisidiction that allows for non-resident aliens giving an input at the highest level of the judicial machinery. This would rightly reflect the reality of Hong Kong as an international, cosmopolitan city.
<p>

<b>HONG KONG - A CIVIL SOCIETY</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
So much for the structural underpinnings of the rule of law in Hong Kong. However, as all of us are well aware, structural underpinnings are a necessary but by no means a sufficient element for guaranteeing the preservation of the rule of law or of a civil society in Hong Kong after 1997. We must probe further. One has to examine how the law operates in action. One has to look also at the culture of the relevant society. One has to inquire whether the population regards the rule of law as an invisible but indispensable aspect of their everyday lives in much the same way as people in the United States or the United Kingdom take the rule of law for granted. The question, in other words, is whether Hong Kong is a civil society.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Had that question been put to me in 1984 at the time of the signing of the Joint Declaration, I would have had to couch my answer with considerable reservations. The same question asked of me today would elicit a much more categorical, positive response. I suppose that, because we have a set transition of finite duration with a scheduled target date, it has the effect of concentrating the mind immensely: not unlike the old adage of a condemned man's mind being wonderfully concentrated upon being informed of his scheduled date of execution! 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Back in 1984, we were fully aware that in 13 years' time, the resumption of the exercise of Chinese sovereignty over Hong Kong will take place, wherefore it was necessary to put our house in order. What has happened over the last 12 years is that, as a result of a process of public education which we as a government have sponsored, we have witnessed a sea change in the attitude of the people of Hong Kong towards the importance of the rule of law as an indispensable underpinning of a civil society. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Statistics on the numbers of writs issued, cases decided, or legal principles laid down by our courts tell, perhaps, a less eloquent story than an examination of our popular culture. Since the mid-1980s, we have enjoyed in Hong Kong a number of hugely successful television series as well as feature films, being homegrown equivalents to "L.A. Law."  These portray bewigged and begowned barristers cross-examining witnesses in court, solicitors taking instructions from lay clients: in short, the lives and loves of lawyers which constitute the very stuff of legal soap opera. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
These are not propaganda pieces produced by the government. And if we were to attempt anything of that ilk, they would not sell!  On the contrary, these are commercially viable programs and movies that have been devised to show the machinery of justice in action, breathing life into the related themes of justice pursued and justice denied. And if the man or woman in the street cannot readily identify with the issues explored on celluloid, then these ventures would surely flop. The fact that they have not done so but have, on the contrary, broken box office records speaks volumes.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
So far as human rights culture is concerned, we have also embarked since 1991 on an ambitious program whereby we supply, free of charge, to all secondary schools in Hong Kong human rights teaching kits which are used by the teachers to teach schoolchildren human rights in lay terms as part of their civic education curriculum. We have also produced video tapes and cartoon booklets on human rights. So successful has this been that the United Nations Committee on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, when they examined Hong Kong in 1994, paid us the ultimate compliment of pronouncing Hong Kong as having done more in propagating and educating its population on human rights than any other country or place that has acceded to the Covenant.
<p>
<b>SURVIVAL OF THE RULE OF LAW IN HONG KONG AFTER 1997</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
So much for the structures, the practices, the culture. Will all this survive the transition?  Will we still see the same dynamics at work post-1997?  This is the ultimate question to which I adverted at the outset. In advancing a cautiously optimistic prognosis, may I cite seven principal factors.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Structural Underpinnings.</b> First of all, the existence of the structural underpinnings, being the foundations of our system, should not be underestimated. They are not meaningless pieces of paper. The treaty (the Joint Declaration) is registered with the United Nations. There exists also the mini-constitution (the Basic Law), which will become a living law because it will be part of a common law system.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>The System's Track Record Throughout the Transition.</b> The proof of the pudding lies, of course, in the eating of it, which leads onto my second factor, which is that our system works and has worked in Hong Kong and has been seen to work throughout the transition. We have been undergoing 12 consecutive years of transition to conclude in a reversion to Chinese sovereignty, and the process has been nothing if not traumatic. It would be disingenuous of me to pretend otherwise. And it would be surprising were that not the case, because we are dealing with real people, people with families and children who worry about their future as well as their children's future.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
However, despite the unavoidable uncertainties, despite the worries and concerns, Hong Kong has not gone the way of, say, the former Yugoslavia. There is no bloodshed on our streets. On the contrary, we have not merely survived, we have flourished. So much so that for every single year since 1984, Hong Kong experienced real growth, in double-digit terms throughout the 1980s and in single-digits throughout the 1990s. And the only reason for the deceleration in real growth is that, as the economists tell us, we have now reached a stage of development whereby single-digit figures are something for which any developed economy would be grateful. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
We have a standard of living which exceeds that of Britain, Sweden, and most Western European nations. We are the fourth-biggest trading power in the world after the European Union, the United States, and Japan. If European Union countries are to be split up into separate sovereign states, we then are the sixth-largest trading power in the world. We are the world's fourth-largest financial center after London, New York, and Tokyo. We have the world's largest container port. We are the premier services center in East Asia and the Western Pacific. None of the above would be the case if Hong Kong were not served by a viable, mature, efficient, and incorrupt legal and judicial system. Those facts stare China in the face.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Hong Kong's Economic Integration with China.</b> The third factor is China's self-interest, based on Hong Kong and China's ever-closer economic integration. I am often asked the question what will happen in 1997. The answer is that 1997 will come as something of an anticlimax. This is because economically we are already integrated with China, so that 1997 will present itself as a date when the political forms catch up with the economic reality. China has enormous stakes in Hong Kong. We still account for 40 percent of China's hard currency earnings. We are by far China's biggest trading partner. Figures for the year ending September 1995 show trade between Hong Kong and China in the region of HK$731 billion, which is just under US$100 billion. We are also the largest single foreign investor in China. The capital value of our investments is US$66 billion. This dwarfs anything invested by the United States, Japan, or the European Union.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
If you were to trace Hong Kong's economic development from a light manufacturing center in the 1970s into a services center by the mid-1980s, you will see our curious metamorphosis into a post-industrial society. Although rising labor and housing costs rendered it no longer economic to manufacture in Hong Kong, we have paradoxically not lost our manufacturing base. We merely relocated our factories north of the border. In the Pearl River Delta area of Southern Guangdong Province alone, you will find 4,000 manufacturing concerns established with Hong Kong capital. Economists talk accordingly of Greater Hong Kong as a cohesive economic unit of 70 million people, which is about the size of West Germany before unification and larger than the present-day France. Little wonder, then, that we are able to maintain our position as the fourth-biggest trading power anywhere in the world. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
China happens also to be the biggest single investor in Hong Kong. China has capital investments in Hong Kong valued at US$31 billion. Again, this dwarfs investment by any other country. Hong Kong's financial markets are a natural vehicle for the raising of capital by Chinese companies by the so-called H shares. Hong Kong's banking system which is the best in Asia is a natural haven for Chinese savings.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The point of this argument is that increasing economic integration between Hong Kong and China makes for a "soft landing" in 1997. Conversely, if Hong Kong and China's respective economies were not even on speaking terms with each other, then we may be in for rather a rude shock come 1997. German unification following the demolition of the Berlin Wall holds a salutary lesson. Germany today is paying the price for want of economic integration between the two territories during the period of division, and looks set to continue to pay such price for a generation to come. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Existentializing Hong Kong's Legal Values.</b> I have already canvassed the domestic existentializing of legal culture which led to the creation of a civil society in Hong Kong. Looking at the Hong Kong-China relationship, if one were to ask the question in 1984, at the time of the signing of the Joint Declaration, whether China truly understood what made Hong Kong tick and whether they appreciated the value of our system, only a dyed-in-the-wool optimist would give a positive response. Even if experts such as economists could glimpse at the argument, it was unlikely that party leaders could existentialize it in their everyday lives. In those days, contact between the mainland and Hong Kong was sparse at best. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Today, however, the psychological landscape has changed beyond recognition. The sons and daughters of the Party elite live and work in Hong Kong. They put their savings in our banks; they buy our stocks; they speculate on our financial markets; they drive our cars; they punt on our racetracks: They live the Hong Kong life and they enjoy it!  The degree of qualitative as well as quantitative understanding in China of Hong Kong's system and what makes it work has increased exponentially. Little wonder that in the Chinese blueprint, we are slated to become the Manhattan-cum-Switzerland for China post-1997.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>The Taiwan Factor.</b>Let us turn now to the Taiwan factor. I do not believe this consideration can ever be swept aside. It operates as a negative disincentive. By that, I mean that if the transition for Hong Kong were to proceed smoothly, it does not mean that Taiwan will come running back to the Chinese fold. Beijing knows that; Taipei knows that; Hong Kong also knows that. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But the three of us are also well aware that, if the transition for Hong Kong were to proceed badly, if Hong Kong should stumble, then the chances for peaceful reunification between the mainland and Taiwan become eliminated entirely. And for all the saber-rattling that has been going on across the Taiwan Strait over the last four months, which I daresay will reach a climax by March this year to coincide with the Presidential election in Taiwan, I for one do not think that peaceful reunification is off the agenda for China. Jiang Zemin cannot afford to take it off the agenda, wherefore it is a factor which must be weighed in the balance.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>The Dragon Wakes.</b> The sixth factor is the most far-reaching. China is a country that has undergone double digit real growth for the last ten consecutive years. In the southernmost provinces which abut Hong Kong such as Guangdong and Fujian, real growth for the last four years had been over 30 percent, which has hitherto been unheard of in recent human history. What this means is that the lives as well as expectations of a quarter of humanity have been transformed, together with the buildup of attendant pressures for economic liberalization and political reforms on the Central People's Government and the provincial authorities which have only partially been met. We are not able to grasp the full consequences of this change because we are much too close to the trees to see the wood. All we say with reasonable certainty is that the economic transformation of China is an event of significance to be compared to the coming of the Industrial Revolution in 19th century Europe.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Hong Kong's Role as Interpreter and Mentor for China.</b> Hong Kong stands at the vortex of this radical metamorphosis. We do so as dictated by history and geography. Hong Kong acts not merely as the bankers for China's modernization and the engine for her economic growth; we form also the natural interface between China and the international community. Hong Kong is the obvious interpreter for China in her dealings with the outside world. We do not throw up the same sort of cultural and linguistic barriers which China encounters when dealing directly with the outside world. Conversely, the international community tends to encounter less pain when they deal with China via Hong Kong than if they were to deal with China directly. Those among you who engage in or advise on China trade know the story full well.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
So we play this role of interpreter and mentor. What this means in the legal sphere is that China looks to us for guidance and for advice. Since about the mid-1980s, China has been fascinated by the common law. Why the common law?  Because China can appreciate it as the instrument for dispute resolution <I>par excellence</I>. The common law, with its doctrine of binding precedent, is able to project a degree of precision and predictability to dispute resolution which is absent from the continental system.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Since about 1987, at least three different law schools in China have been studying Hong Kong law as a specialty and translating our laws into Chinese. Why Hong Kong law?  Perhaps because Hong Kong law is the most user-friendly of the common law systems from the Chinese perspective. They can see it operate in the Hong Kong context. They can see its successes. They can measure its effectiveness. They encounter less of a cultural and linguisitic barrier when studying Hong Kong law than that of another common law system such as the American model. Last but not least, we happen conveniently to be the most politically acceptable member of the common law family since we will soon be part of the one sovereign state.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
We have actually overtaken these mainland law schools in the translation of our laws into Chinese. We now draft all our present and future legislation bilingually, in Chinese and in English, with two teams working in tandem. The end-product we supply to our Chinese counterparts, principally the Legislative Affairs Commission of the National People's Congress, not because we are obliged to but in order to stimulate their interest and often at their request. We have supplied the NPC Legislative Affairs Commission with our bankruptcy law, our companies legislation, and other commercial legislation which they have consulted in drafting their own laws.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
At the regional level, the degree of influence we exercise is more striking. Let us consider, for example, Shenzhen, which is our immediate northern neighbor. Shenzhen is the first of the special economic zones established by China in 1979. At the time, Shenzhen was a sleepy border town with a string of paddy fields. It is now a bustling city of 3 million. Since 1992, Shenzhen has been given legislative autonomy. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This means that Shenzhen can pass its own laws, different and separate from those of the rest of the country, through its own Shenzhen People's Congress. In the last three-and-a-half years, Shenzhen has enacted approximately 250 pieces of primary and subsidiary legislation, of which fully two-thirds are plagiarized from the Hong Kong statute books with our blessing and cooperation and without charge for copyright royalties!  They are highly appreciative of our efforts. The Standing Committee Shenzhen People's Congress has indicated to me, shortly before I commenced this speaking tour, that Shenzhen wants to achieve legal parity with Hong Kong, leading eventually to economic integration with us.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
That aspiration constitutes, at the moment, little more than a pipedream. It is also moot whether such a scheme would be permissible under the Basic Law. However, the more important fact to bear in mind is that the common law is not, of course, just a collection of statutes. The common law is a living body of case law. It is also a set of practices and values. The common law partakes of a certain spirit, a certain philosophy, a certain approach which respects the principle of the independence of the judiciary, which respects the independence of the legal profession, and which demands a minimum degree of objectivity and professionalism. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Perhaps not surprisingly, the Shenzhen government is interested in having their lawyers trained by the Attorney General's Chambers in Hong Kong, and we have commenced a dialogue on this issue. In the same manner, we have commenced a dialogue on training lawyers at the level of both the Central People's Government and provincial governments.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
We already administer a program of training young Chinese private sector lawyers, jointly with the Overseas Development Aid Office of the British Government, the British Council, the English bar, the English Law Society, and London University whereby 12 of the ablest young Chinese lawyers are selected every year and sent to be trained in England for ten months. They spend the first four months at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London University, where they are taught the rudiments of the English legal system and the use of legal English, whereafter they spend the next three months attached to leading solicitors' firms, followed by a further three months' attachment with barristers chambers in the Temple and Lincoln's Inn. At the end of their ten months' English experience, the trainees come to Hong Kong, where they spend their final two months working in the Hong Kong private sector milieu before returning to China. As result, we now have an expanding network of alumni spread throughout the country, which will serve us well after 1997.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
We also help in the training of Chinese judges, who constitute, of course, key players in the judicial system. It is common ground that, currently, the degree of professionalism of the Chinese judiciary leaves much to be desired. Since 1992, the Supreme People's Court has set up a Senior Judges Training Center. Every year, 120 judges are selected from all over the country, given a year's sabbatical, and sent in two batches of 60 each to, respectively, Peking University Law School and People's University Law School to undergo specialist training. Afterwards the trainees return to the various provinces and cities from whence they came. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
We are in the process of negotiating the incorporation of a common law component into that training program. We hope to bring these senior judges down to Hong Kong to undergo training, using funds to be made available in Hong Kong for that purpose. The Supreme People's Court has recently also set up a Senior Judges Educational Foundation, on which I have been asked to sit as one of the founding honorary directors. We hope through this foundation to enhance much-needed professionalism for Chinese judges.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
What of the legal profession?  Under the common law or in any mature legal system, the legal profession practices independently of government. Currently, Chinese lawyers are licensed to practice by the Ministry of Justice. The Ministry of Justice indicates that they intend to privatize the Chinese bar within 18 months. That was their stated target date in August last year. We can reasonably expect the Chinese bar to be rendered independent of the government sometime before 1997.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
At the national level, we see the development of another phenomenon: that is, the beginnings of a case law system in China. Since 1992, the Supreme People's Court has been publishing reports of their case decisions on an annual basis in four volumes. Volume One is administrative law;Volume Two, criminal law; Volume Three, civil law; and Volume Four, economic law. It would be risible, however, to pretend that by this means, China will shortly be joining the common law family, for these reports have no binding force as we understand that term to be within a common law context, although they are of high persuasive value. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The implications are nevertheless clear; namely, that China is travelling down a road not dissimilar to that taken by France and Germany not so long ago when they started publishing law reports of their superior courts. That took place as a result of the pressures of European economic integration. In the Chinese context, the spur to change has likewise been economic in origin; namely, the Chinese modernization program. Last year, the task of translating into English the China Law Reports was complete and published by Butterworths, the leading publisher of common law legal texts outside of the United States. We in the Attorney General's Chambers in Hong Kong, as well as I personally, have played a small role in this process of preparing the English edition, which will be published on an annual basis.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The foregoing are but illustrations of remarkable developments in China in which we play a role, often modest, at times crucial, but all of which will assist in the modernization of the country. Hong Kong stands in the vortex of this process of seminal change in the biggest country in the world. In coming to some sort of prognosis as to what will happen to Hong Kong and to China after 1997, one must weigh in the balance the various provisions we have made for continuation of the system, the economic reality in the case of the Hong Kong-China synergy, <I>realpolitik</I> in the case of China's relations with Taiwan and with the outside world -- in particular, the United States response to China's changing relationship with Taiwan -- and, last but by no means least, self-interest on the part of China. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
All of the above will combine to shorten the odds on our system surviving, and not merely surviving <I>simpliciter</I>, but also influencing change within China itself. 1997 will present itself as a unique opportunity for engineering positive and constructive change in China for the benefit not just of China and Hong Kong, but also the entire Asia-Pacific Region and, by extension, the rest of the world. This will come about as a natural development, since after 1997 Hong Kong will be able to play the role of mentor and interpreter from the inside, that is to say from within the Chinese body politic. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I often liken Hong Kong's special role to that of playing Virgil to China's Dante, showing Dante the way ahead, in a late 20th century re-enactment of the <I>Divine Comedy</i> in an East Asian setting to herald the impending dawn of the Pacific Century. And after traversing Hell and Purgatory, eventually we will hopefully reach also Paradise at the end of our journey.

<title> The Flat Tax Cuts Individual Income Taxes in Every State -- Heritage</title>

<h3>The Flat Tax Cuts Individual Income Taxes in Every State</h3>

<p>

F.Y.I. No. 86<br>
February 7, 1996
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
<a href="fyi86t1.gif">Table 1</a>: States That Benefit Most from a 17% Flat Tax<br>
<a href="fyi86a1.gif">Appendix 1</a>: Comparison of Average Household Tax Payments by State under Current Tax Law and a Flat Tax of 17% and 20%<br>
<a href="fyi86a2.gif">Appendix 2</a>: Comparison of Total Tax Payments by State under Current Tax Law and under a Flat Tax of 17% and 20%<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;With support from many presidential candidates and a ringing endorsement from the <a href="/taxcom/reptoc.html">National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform</a>, the idea of a flat tax has captured the imagination of long-suffering taxpayers. This support should come as no surprise. The current system, which penalizes work, saving, investment, and entrepreneurship, imposes nearly $200 billion of compliance costs on the economy and corrupts the political process.<sup>1</sup>  By contrast, a flat tax would spur growth while treating taxpayers equally. Moreover, a properly designed flat tax also would provide much-needed tax relief. As <a href="fyi86t1.gif">Table 1</a> indicates, the benefits of the flat tax to individual taxpayers would be considerable.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The <a href="fyi86t1.gif">table</a> compares how individual income taxpayers will fare if the current system is replaced by a 17 percent flat tax.<sup>2</sup>  Such a reform proposal would tax individual wage and salary income at a 17 percent rate and would apply the same rate, at the business level, to all interest earnings, dividends, capital gains, and other non-labor income.<sup>3</sup>

<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Besides the rates and deductions, the biggest difference between the flat tax and today's code is the way the flat tax treats income from savings, equities, appreciated capital assets, and estates. Flat tax proposals based on the Hall-Rabushka model, such as the <a href="http://www.house.gov/armey.flattax/">Armey-Shelby</a> bill, do not double-tax savings or estate income, since the principal used to create such income streams already has been taxed and, in the case of interest income, reflects in part the level of taxes paid by financial institutions. Dividends and capital gains also are not taxed at the individual level, because taxes are paid at the business level on the income that creates dividends and produces appreciation in the value of capital assets.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<a href="fyi86t1.gif">Table 1</a> shows, for example, that Connecticut's per household tax liability drops by $1,856 under a flat tax of 17 percent. The 17 percent flat tax saves New Yorkers filing individual income tax returns almost $10 billion, and the total individual tax bill in South Dakota falls by 38 percent. Appendices 1 and 2 present <a href="fyi86a1.gif">average</a> and <a href="fyi86a2.gif">total</a> tax savings for all 50 states and the District of Columbia. It is important to note that these tables argue only that average tax liabilities and the total tax bill will be reduced under a flat tax of 17 percent, not that all taxpayers will see their taxes reduced.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Some critics of the flat tax have complained that it is not possible to reduce everyone's taxes and still have a tax system that produces about the same amount of federal revenue as the current one does. They are right, of course. Generally, lower taxes on individuals are made possible by two factors. The many proposals based on the Hall-Rabushka model,<sup>4</sup> for example, would cause a shift in the tax burden to corporations. These higher taxes, needless to say, ultimately are borne by individual workers, consumers, and shareholders, but the actual payment of the tax takes place at the corporate level.<sup>5</sup>  The second reason individuals will enjoy dramatically lower tax payments is that sponsors of the legislation want to reduce the amount of money the government takes out of the private sector. Cutting federal spending over a seven-year period, for example, would enable Congress to reduce tax rates. The flat tax, in other words, is designed both to cut taxes and to reform the system to make it fair. To avoid higher deficits, the lower level of revenue collections would be offset by spending savings and the additional revenues generated by stronger economic growth.
<p>
<b>WHAT IS THE FLAT TAX?</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The flat tax would repeal the current income tax code and replace it with a system based on the following principles:
<p><ul>
<li> Tax all income with no deductions except a generous allowance based on family size. Today's complex system could be replaced by two simple, postcard-sized forms, one for business and one for individuals.
<p>
<li> Tax all income at one rate, applying the law equally to all taxpayers. A taxpayer with ten times the taxable income of his neighbor would pay ten times as much in taxes.
<p>
<li>Tax all income just once, ending the bias against savings and investment. Capital income would be taxed on the business form to ensure compliance, and labor income would be taxed on the individual form.
</ul><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;With so much interest in replacing today's unfair tax code with a system that rewards productive behavior, ends special-interest lobbying, and forces everyone to play by the same rules, policymakers and other interested parties have been clamoring for more details about the impact of this proposed reform. The state-by-state figures demonstrate the amount of tax relief individual taxpayers will realize if the 17 percent flat tax proposed in the Armey-Shelby bill for the 1994 tax year is enacted into law.
<p>

<b>A Note on Technical Matters</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The "current" tax liabilities in <a href="fyi86a1.gif">Appendix 1</a> include all of the kinds of taxable income that individuals now report on their annual 1040 tax form. Individuals currently report their labor income (for example, wages and salaries) as well as business income from self-employment, trusts, partnerships, farming operations, and other business activities. However, the more prominent flat tax proposals make an important change in the way small business income is reported. Proposals similar to the Armey-Shelby bill separate labor income from business income and allow businesses to deduct from their gross income the costs of operations, the value of land and capital structures purchased during the year, and the wages and salaries paid to their employees. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This separation of labor from business income makes comparing the current tax system to a flat tax system difficult. In order to compare current taxes fairly with those collected under a flat tax, we added together the flat taxes individuals would pay on their labor income and on their small business income. This combination is reported in the flat tax columns of Appendices <a href="fyi86a1.gif">1</a> and <a href="fyi86a2.gif">2</a>. Thus, both sets of numbers include taxes paid on labor and business income. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The data shown in <a href="fyi86t1.gif">Table 1</a> and Appendices 1 and 2 are based on income tax records contained on the I.R.S. Public Use File for 1991, a statistically accurate sample of all individual income tax returns for that year. The file contains 155,000 taxpaying households and 178 tax variables per household. When a variable is multiplied by its weight, the value of the variable equals its national total. Thus, the value of wage and salary income for a family earning $35,000 equals the national total for families in that income class when it is multiplied by its national weight. These are the same data the IRS's own Statistics of Income Division uses when preparing its annual analysis of taxpayers. They are the most accurate and complete tax data available for public use, and the data for tax year 1991 are the most current data available.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Heritage adjusted the state-by-state estimates of current and flat tax liabilities drawn from the I.R.S. Public Use File for 1991 by multiplying these estimates by the total change in the CPI-U between December 1991 and December 1994. Adjusting our 1991 estimates by the CPI-U produced 1994 estimates that were within 0.6 percent of actual collections. We chose December 1994 rather than December 1995 as our terminal point because estimates for annual federal revenue collected through the income tax are not particularly sound until June of the next year. It also is worth noting that the Public Use File for 1994 is not yet available.

<h2>The Estate Tax: Not Worth All the Trouble</h2><BR>
by Raymond J. Keating<br>
Chief Economist
<P>
Small Business Survival Foundation<BR>
</center>
<P>
<P>
Benjamin Franklin pointed out that &quot;in this world nothing
is certain but death and taxes.&quot;  However, dying and taxing
used to be two separate events &#173;&#173; both generally faced
with trepidation.  Leave it to government to bring these two anxious
moments together in one levy &#173;&#173; the estate tax.
<P>
Of course, the estate tax inflicts great harm on family businesses.
 This government hostile takeover &#173;&#173; estate tax rates
range from 18 percent to 55 percent, reaching 60 percent for some
estates &#173;&#173; at the time of an owner's death can be too
much to overcome.  Indeed, as pointed out last year by Investor's
Business Daily (April 12, 1995), 60 percent of family businesses
fail to survive to the second generation, and 90 percent do not
make it to the third.  The estate tax acts as a leading cause
of family business deaths.  In addition, this enormous tax on
business assets offers little incentive for an owner to continue
investing in and expanding his business as he grows older.  
<P>
To say the least, the estate tax acts as a burden on the economy.
 However, the so&#173;called pay&#173;off for the government is
nominal at best.  As noted in the accompanying chart, real revenues
from federal death taxes have not grown much since 1975.  In fact,
1995 estate and gift tax revenues were actually less than their
1977 level.  On a per capita basis, inflation&#173;adjusted estate
tax revenues were down by one&#173;third between 1977 and 1995.
 In addition, estate tax revenues amounted to just over 1 percent
of total federal revenues in 1995.  Factor in compliance and litigation
efforts relating to the estate tax, and the federal government's
take drops much further (some estimate that as much as 75 percent
of estate taxes are eaten up by such costs).  Add in lost businesses,
jobs, and output, and the estate tax becomes a net loser in terms
of federal revenues.
<P>
When weighing the federal government's net revenues from the estate
tax against the considerable economic damage wrought by this levy,
 the case for eliminating the estate tax becomes crystal clear.

<h2>The Estate Tax: Another Case of Envy Run Amok</h2><BR>
by Raymond J. Keating
<br>
Chief Economist
Small Business Survival Foundation<BR>
</center>
<hr>
<P>
<P>
Envy always makes for dismal economics and bad tax policy.  We've
made this point time and again at the Small Business Survival
Foundation (for example, see &quot;The Great Tax Debate: Making
Sense of Competing Tax Plans by Raymond J. Keating, June 1995).
 Unfortunately, most of today's U.S. tax system can only be justified
on the basis of envy &#173;&#173; sound economics plays no part
at all.
<P>
The income tax, for example, diminishes incentives for working,
saving, investing, and risk taking, while at the same time, is
inefficient and intrusive.  The current U.S. income tax came into
existence in 1913.  It may have seemed fairly innocuous at first.
 Rates ranged from 1 percent to 7 percent, with the lowest rate
not taking effect until a married couple's income hit $60,000
(in inflation&#173;adjusted 1995 dollars, that is) and the top
rate not kicking in until income topped $7.4 million (again, in
1995 dollars).  In subsequent years, as we all know, income tax
rates skyrocketed, reaching ever deeper into the pockets of all
working Americans, not just the wealthy.  And for the most part,
government squandered these resources.
<P>
Following quickly on the heals of the income tax was the estate
tax, imposed in 1916.  This was another envy&#173;driven levy.
 When first imposed, the estate tax was targeted at the rich,
with rates ranging from 1 percent to 10 percent.  Today, the estate
tax takes hold at a lower threshold, with far more severe tax
rates, ranging from 18 percent to 55 percent (even 60 percent
for certain estates).  That is, since the estate tax's inception,
the lowest rate has jumped by 1,700 percent and the top rate by
more than 205 percent.  In addition, the highest tax rate would
have taken hold at an estate valued at almost $70 million under
the original estate tax structure, versus today's, with the top
rate kicking in at just over $3 million.
<P>
Efforts to cut the estate tax are worthy.  However, since no sound
economics basis exists for such a tax, and since the estate tax
serves as a major destroyer of family businesses and jobs, the
most productive step would be to eliminate the estate tax.  
<P>
Envy must give way to economics in order for entrepreneurship
and the economy to flourish.<BR>

<h2>Capital Gains Taxation and Venture Capital</h2><BR>
by Raymond J. Keating<br>
Chief Economist
<p>Small Business Survival Foundation<BR>
</center>
<hr>
<P>
<P>
   Venture capital epitomizes the great spirit of entrepreneurial
capitalism.  Visionary individuals place their resources at great
risk by investing in new ideas, inventions, and innovations &#173;&#173;
by investing in entrepreneurs.  In their own right, venture capitalists
are entrepreneurs themselves.  By making capital available to
promising enterprises, they help to create dynamic change and
growth in the economy.
<P>
   In addition to the many market&#173;based obstacles and risks
confronted by such investors, the government piles on its own
costs.  At the top of the government's destructive actions rests
the capital gains tax.  Capital gains taxation impedes risk taking
by venture capitalists by cutting into potential returns.  The
vast risks associated with venture capital investments need to
be offset by opportunities for substantial returns.  Today's lofty,
non&#173;indexed capital gains tax clearly restrains venture capital
investing, and therefore, entrepreneurship and economic growth.
 
<P>
   As noted in the accompanying chart, real capital commitments
to private venture capital funds were rising robustly prior to
a sharp increase in the capital gains tax in 1987.  The Tax Reform
Act of 1986 possessed one key flaw &#173;&#173; the capital gains
tax was increased by 40 percent, from 20 percent to 28 percent.
 In addition, since capital gains are not indexed for inflation,
the real capital gains tax rate turns out to be much higher than
this oft&#173;stated nominal rate of 28 percent. 
<P>
   Prior to the 1987 capital gains tax hike, real venture capital
commitments rose at a 29.4 percent average annual rate from 1981
to 1986.  Afterwards, the real annual rate of increase averaged
6.5 percent.  A lower capital gains tax rate would have meant
greater venture capital investment.  Indeed, if the average real
rate of increase in venture funds during the early 1980s had been
maintained, 1995 commitments might have topped $40 billion &#173;&#173;
ten times the actual 1995 level.
<P>
   Any serious effort to shift economic growth into high gear
means boosting private sector incentives for investing and risk
taking in order to get capital in the hands of entrepreneurs.
 That, in turn, means eliminating the capital gains tax.<BR>

<h2>Capital Gains and Entrepreneurship</h2><BR>
by Raymond J. Keating<br>
Chief Economist - Small Business Survival Foundation<br>
</center>
<hr>
<P>
<P>
Entrepreneurs are the driving force behind economic growth.  Therefore,
one of the most damaging levies government can impose on individuals
and the economy is the capital gains tax &#173;&#173; a direct
tax on risk taking.  After being reduced in the late 1970s and
early 1980s, the capital gains tax rate was increased by 40 percent
&#173;&#173; from 20 percent to 28 percent &#173;&#173; under
the 1986 Tax Reform Act.  
<P>
The accompanying chart shows one measure of entrepreneurial activity
 &#173;&#173; new business incorporations from 1967 to 1995. 
Since the 1986 capital gains tax hike, new business incorporations
have been quite lackluster.  The break between a powerful rise
in new business incorporations prior to 1987 and thereafter is
striking.
<P>
Lagging entrepreneurship means a lagging economy.  Along with
the Bush and Clinton tax hikes and mounting regulatory costs,
high capital gains taxes explain much of our recent sluggish economic
growth.  Annual real economic growth has averaged just 2.3 percent
since the 1986 capital gains tax hike, particularly slowing after
1989 as the relative dearth in entrepreneurship took hold.  The
Clinton Administration estimates that this anemic 2.3 percent
annual real growth rate will continue into the foreseeable future,
grossly under&#173;performing the post&#173;Civil War annual real
average rate of 3.5 percent.  
<P>
If the capital gains tax had not been increased, incentives for
investing and risk taking would not have diminished, more capital
would have been available for investment, and chances improved
for entrepreneurial activity to increase at a healthy clip.  In
fact, if new business incorporations had managed to continue at
the average annual rate of increase from the previous two decades,
we would have seen almost 2.5 million more new business incorporations
over the period 1987 to 1995.  From 1968 to 1986, new business
incorporations rose at a 6.8 percent annual rate versus a meager
1.1 percent from 1987 to 1995.  In 1995 alone, new business incorporations
would have been almost 470,000 higher than they actually were.
 These higher levels of entrepreneurship would have meant more
products, innovations, efficiencies, economic growth, and jobs.
<P>
A deep cut in the capital gains tax and indexing for inflation
would surely boost incentives for risk taking and spur economic
growth.<BR>

<h2>The Dole Economic Plan and the Entrepreneur</h2>
by Raymond J. Keating<br>
Chief Economist<br>
Small Business Survival Committee<br>
</center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<dd>With the announcement of the Dole economic plan, tax cuts are back on the front burner of the nation's public policy debate.  And though one can find all sorts of opinions on whether this is a good or bad thing, from the perspective of small business, entrepreneurship, and economic growth, the major proposals put forth in the Dole plan make for sound economic policy.
<p>
<ul>
<li>Cutting the capital gains tax.  The Dole plan calls for a 50 percent cut in the top capital gains tax rate on individuals from 28 percent to 14 percent.  
<p>
<dd>Barring a complete tax overhaul, there is no tax cut that will do more to spur entrepreneurship, investment, economic growth, and job creation than a sharp reduction in the capital gains tax rate.  The great hurdle to starting up and/or expanding a business remains access to capital.  Investing and entrepreneurship are high-risk endeavors.  High risks require the opportunity for substantial returns.  Slash the capital gains tax in half and you enhance the potential returns from risk-taking.
<p>
<dd>A 50 percent reduction in the capital gains tax rate would provide a major boost to small business, entrepreneurship, and the economy.
<p>
<li> Across-the-board cut in personal income taxes.  A 15 percent across-the-board cut in personal income tax rates works favorably for small business and the economy in three key ways:
<p>
<ol>
<li> Boosts incentives for individuals to work, save, invest, and take risks.  Again, this is a straightforward relative price argument -- as the old saying goes, the less you tax something, the more of it you get.
<p>
<li> Resources are shifted from the unproductive sphere of government to the productive private sector.  Or another way to put it, individuals operating in the private marketplace spend and invest their money far more efficiently and wisely than do government bureaucrats.
<p>
<li> Since about 79 percent of all business tax returns are either sole proprietorships or partnerships (the other 21 percent being corporations), then an across-the-board personal income tax cut directly impacts the bottom line of millions of U.S. businesses.  Lower taxes mean more funds available for capital investment, additional employees, et al. 
</ol>
<p>
<li> Additional measures.  The Dole plan calls for other tax cuts and reforms impacting small businesses and entrepreneurs, including: 
<p>
<ul>
<li> Unrestricted tax-free medical savings accounts (MSAs) and 100 percent deductibility for health insurance for the self-employed.  MSAs inject choice and accountability into the health-care system, and 100 percent deductibility places all businesses on an equal plain in terms of the tax treatment of health care expenses.
<p>
<li> Estate tax reductions.  The estate tax amount to nothing more than a government hostile takeover of family businesses.  All cuts in the estate tax are welcome, hopefully on the path to complete repeal of the estate tax.
<p>
<li> Repeal of the 1993 tax increase on Social Security beneficiaries.  Again, this will boost incentives to work and keep resources in the private sector.
<li> Expanded IRAs and institution of spousal IRAs.  Such measures will boost incentives to save and expand loanable funds available to business.
<p>
<li> Regulatory reform.  Requiring peer-reviewed, science-based risk assessment and cost benefit analysis for new regulations, regulatory review of all new regulations every four years, and a task force to review and recommend sunsetting ineffective and costly regulations, all point toward gaining some much-needed control over a federal regulatory apparatus strangling businesses, investment, and entrepreneurship.
<p>
<li>Legal reform.  Measures such as limiting punitive damages in most cases, abolishing joint and several liability for non-economic damages in civil cases, and curbing contingency fee abuses, all amount to a good start at alleviating many of the burdensome costs of our legal system that damage or destroy countless businesses and the jobs they create.
</ul>
<p>
</ul>
<dd>U.S. businesses and entrepreneurs need tax cuts, regulatory relief, and legal reform.  The cost of government is massive, inhibiting new business formation, economic growth, and job creation.  Once fully implemented, the proposals in the Dole economic plan would: 
<ul>
<li> Increase incentives for working, saving, investing, and entrepreneurship.
<p>
<li> Boost rates of economic growth and job creation.
<p>
<li> Help both equity and bond markets, as incentives for investment are enhanced and faster economic growth eases inflation threats (assuming sound monetary policy).  After all, inflation results from too much money chasing too few goods -- faster growth means more goods and services.
</ul>
<p>
<dd>The bottom line is: Tax cuts help small businesses and entrepreneurs.

<center><i>November 1995</i><hr>
<h3>Improving the Flat Tax</h3> <P>
<b>by Raymond J. Keating<br> 
Chief Economist<br>
Small Business Survival Committee</b></center><P>	
<hr>
<P>
It is encouraging to see that significant proposals for overhauling the U.S. tax system are actually under serious consideration today, not only in the many think tanks that sprinkle Washington, D.C.'s urban landscape, but in the halls of Congress and on the presidential campaign trail.  In a couple of years, our federal tax code may shed thousands of pages and actually make sense to all Americans.  Indeed, the income tax as we now know it may no longer exist.	Tax Principles.  In a recent Small Business Survival Foundation booklet, "The Great Tax Debate: Making Sense of Competing Tax Plans," our current tax system and a variety of proposed substitutes were analyzed and scored.  Each system was evaluated according to a set of principles for sound taxation: <P>
<ul>
<LI> maintain a low, flat tax rate to limit economic distortions and promote growth; <LI> cease taxing returns on capital, particularly capital gains, in order to eliminate double taxation and spur entrepreneurship and investment -- the economy's lifeblood; 
<LI> create no tax-based 
incentives for government to inflate the currency; 
<LI> clarity -- taxes and who pays them should be obvious; <LI> paying taxes should be as simple as possible for the taxpayer; 
<LI> the tax-gathering bureaucracy should be limited in both size and powers; 
<LI> incentives for tax avoidance should be minimized; 
<LI> and finally, a tax system 
should not make it any easier for government to increase expenditures.	
</ul><P>
<b>Flat Tax and Retail Sales Tax Score Best</b><P>
  According to these criteria, the flat tax and national retail sales tax score best, followed at quite a distance by the value-added tax, the consumed-income tax, and our current mess of a tax code.  Of the top two proposals, the flat tax carries the most significant political support at this time.<P>
<b>Armey Plan</b><P>
  As currently proposed by U.S. House of Representatives Majority Leader Dick Armey, a flat tax would impose a 17 percent rate on both personal and business income.  For individuals, capital gains, dividends, and interest income would not be taxed, having already been captured at the business level.  Personal allowances could be deducted at $21,400 for a couple, and $5,000 for each dependent.  Therefore, a family of four would not pay any tax on earnings up to $31,400.	For business, the 17 percent tax rate would apply to gross revenues minus purchases of goods and services, capital equipment, structures, land, and wages paid to employees.  Deductions would not be allowed for fringe benefits, interest paid, or payments to owners.	Such a plan would simplify greatly how individuals and businesses pay taxes.  <P>Reducing the top tax rate to 17 percent boosts incentives for work and risk taking.  An absence of taxation on individual capital gains, dividend, and interest income, and expensing of capital goods by business, will spur entrepreneurship and investment. <P>
 	A great threat to the beauty and efficiency of the flat tax remains politicians' incessant desire to serve special interests by tinkering with the tax code -- creating loopholes and raising rates.   The current Armey plan would counter such tendencies by requiring a three-fifths super-majority congressional vote in order to raise taxes.  <P>
<b>	Three Steps to a Better Flat Tax</b><P>
  As good as this plan is, however, room for improvement on the flat tax exists.  Three steps would place the flat tax on firmer economic ground -- in greater compliance with the aforementioned principles of sound taxation -- though albeit on more radical political terrain.  However, aren't Republicans telling us we are in the midst of a political revolution?  	<P>
First, the original Armey flat tax plan called for the end of individual income tax withholding, which had begun as a wartime measure during World War II.  <P>

Ending withholding would drive home the true cost of government to the taxpayer.  Instead of having taxes withdrawn before receiving one's paycheck, taxpayers would receive their full pay and then have to write out a check to the federal government for income taxes  on a monthly or quarterly basis.  Individuals would gain a much clearer picture of how much government costs.  In its most recent manifestation, though, the Armey plan no longer proposes an end to withholding.  This much-needed reform should be reinstated.	<P>

Second, tax reformers should stop worshiping the idol of "revenue neutrality."  A desire for revenue-neutral tax reform already forced Rep. Armey to reduce his proposed personal allowances and deductions.  Taxpayers and the U.S. economy need both a sound tax system and lower taxes.  Setting a goal of revenue neutrality means that one tacitly accepts that current levels of government spending and taxation are just right, a dubious proposition to say the least.<P>

In 1995, the federal government will spend $1.54 trillion.  Rather than accepting as inevitable a relentless climb to $2 trillion -- as both Democrats and Republicans seemingly have done -- the goal should be to reduce spending -- descending to the $1 trillion mark.  <P>

Room for downsizing government is substantial and the need for tax reduction paramount.  	<P>
Third, it remains in dispute as to who bears the ultimate burden when it comes to paying business income taxes -- owners, employees, consumers, or some combination of these individuals?  No matter how the burden shakes out, business income taxes remain hidden from the view of those who pay them.  Clarity dictates that taxing income at the business level should be terminated, with dividends taxed, if at all, at the individual level.	Smaller Government and a Flat Tax.  Tax overhaul needs to be part of a comprehensive effort to ease governmental burdens.  Government spending has to be cut substantially.  Income at the business level, capital gains, and interest earned should not be taxed at all.  And the tax rate on all remaining income -- wages, salaries, and dividends -- needs to be as low as possible.  Throughout history, until the early-to-mid twentieth century, a levy of 10 percent was always considered a heavy tax.  A ten percent flat tax on wages, salaries and dividends, with no deductions, would still allow the federal government to collect more than $300 billion in income taxes, conservatively estimated, not to mention revenues from the social security payroll tax.	What would result from this even more revolutionary version of the flat tax?  <P>Entrepreneurship, investment, economic growth, and job creation would be driven to heights that in recent high-tax-rate decades were considered unimaginable.<P><P><center>[ <a href="/sbsc/home.html>SBSC Home</a> | <a href="/sbsc/i-tax.html">Tax Watch Index</a> ]</center></body></html>

<h3>Who Will Be Tax Reform's "Braveheart"?</h3> 
<b>by Raymond J. Keating<br> 
Chief Economist<br>
Small Business Survival Committee</b></center>	
<hr>
<P>
The need to overhaul our tax code has long been apparent, but the necessary political courage was always in short supply.  However, a historic transformation may be under way in Congress as tax overhaul now receives serious consideration.  	As portrayed in Mel Gibson's movie "Braveheart," William Wallace laid the groundwork for Robert the Bruce to gain Scotland's independence from England in the late 13th and early 14th centuries.  One might say that House Majority Leader Dick Armey and House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer are vying for the role of William Wallace on the matter of tax reform, hoping that their own Robert the Bruce will be elected president in 1996 leading to independence from the many burdens of our current income tax structure.
<p><b>	Can an Income Tax Be Benign?</b>
<P>  As constituted today, the federal income tax system is a mess.  It is punitive, complicated, inefficient, intrusive, and serves as an impediment to entrepreneurship, investment, economic growth, and job creation.  Interestingly however, when initially imposed, the federal income tax appeared rather straightforward and not all that burdensome -- almost benign.  Of course, appearances can be deceiving.
<p>
<b>Original Personal Income Tax</b>  
<P>
As originally proposed, the income tax was meant to impose a very low level of tax rates on only the very highest levels of income.  The 16th amendment to the U.S. Constitution allowing for an income tax eventually won approval because proponents argued that it was a way to force the so-called "robber barons" to pay taxes.  The income tax was not supposed to be a mechanism for reaching into the pockets of most Americans.
<p>
	Figures 1 and 2 illustrate this point quite clearly.  <a href="#1">Figure 1</a> shows the personal income tax structure as initially imposed in 1913, while <a href="#2">Figure 2</a> illustrates what this tax system would look like in 1994 dollars.
<p>
	Undoubtedly, the income tax was not meant to be paid by most citizens, nor were rates so high as to significantly undermine the spirit of enterprise.  For example, if the original income tax system had been left in effect and indexed for inflation, today single taxpayers would pay no tax on any earnings up to almost $45,000 and married couples on earnings up to almost $60,000.  A 1 percent tax rate would be in effect on incomes up to about $300,000.  The top rate of 7 percent would not take hold until earnings of almost $7.5 million.
<p>
<b>Original Corporate Income Tax</b>
<P>
  As for the corporate income 
tax, it was imposed in 1909 at a rate of 1 percent and a $5,000 exemption.  Again, translated into 1994 dollars, corporate income would face the 1 percent rate with an exemption of $81,967.
<p>
<b>Envy = Bad Economics</b>
<P>
  The income tax was an attempt to finance the expansion of government through an appeal to envy.  Envy, though, tends to know no boundaries, and never makes for good economic policy.  The income tax was transformed rather quickly from a light tax on very high incomes to a heavy tax on almost all levels of income.  Naturally, tax avoidance among upper-income individuals -- the ultimate targets of the income tax -- increased along with rising tax rates.
<p>
	As the U.S. undertakes a historic debate over its tax system in the coming months and years, it must be remembered at all times that the income tax remains a dangerous levy.  It raises the costs of working, saving, investing, and risk taking, thereby restraining economic growth.  
<p>
<b>A Boost to Government Spending</b>
<P>
  The income tax also acts as high-octane fuel for the growth of government spending.  Under the income-tax regime, between 1913 and 1994, inflation-adjusted federal government expenditures increased by 13,592 percent!  Over this same period, personal and corporate income taxes grew from 7 percent of total federal revenues and 0.1 percent of the economy, to more than 54 percent of total federal revenues and over 10 percent of U.S. GDP.	
<P>
<b>No Income Tax Led to High Growth</b>
<P>
  As the nineteenth century came to a close and the twentieth century dawned, the United States government imposed no income taxes on its citizens.  It was a period when America took great strides in becoming the world's most powerful economy.  Entrepreneurs pushed the economy to astounding rates of economic growth.  In fact, from 1870 to 1913 -- from when it was agreed that the Civil War income tax would end until the income tax was re-imposed -- the U.S. economy expanded by over 435 percent in real terms, or by an average rate of more than 10 percent per year -- with no inflation.	
<P>
<b>Reforms for the 21st Century</b>
<P>
  As the twentieth century comes to a close and we look toward the twenty-first century, many are concerned with America's economic vitality in an increasingly competitive world economy.  Surely, we must considerably downsize government, deregulate our economy, and re-link the dollar to gold to ensure greater price stability.
<p>
	Perhaps most important, though, we should replace our current tax system with a low, flat tax -- bringing us closer to the original intent of the income tax.  To some degree, this is Representative Armey's suggestion -- his bid, if you will, to be the William Wallace of tax reform.  In contrast, some say simply put an end to one of the twentieth century's biggest impediments to entrepreneurship and growth - the income tax -- and replace it with a direct consumption tax, such as a national retail sales tax.  This is Representative Archer's claim to being a Wallace-like tax reformer.	As long as rates are kept low, the resulting entrepreneurial boom from either plan will stagger even the most wild-eyed optimists and launch the U.S. economy into the twenty-first century.  Of course, as to who will play the role of Robert the Bruce, and actually implement a massive tax revolution, remains to be determined in November 1996.
<p>
<b>Guarding Against Losing Tax Independence</b>
<P>
  One needs to remember, though, that after William Wallace and Robert the Bruce, Scotland eventually lost its independence.  Tax reformers face a similar, ominous threat to their long-run success.  Specifically, flat tax proponents must guard against future presidents and members of Congress merely raising tax rates after most all deductions have been eliminated.  The only way to guard against such backsliding is to require a super-majority vote of the Congress in order to raise taxes.  
<p>
	Retail-sales-tax advocates, of course, must ensure that an 
income tax is not re-imposed at some point down the road.  They must repeal the 16th amendment to the U.S. Constitution allowing for an income tax.	
<p>
Today, the flat tax holds the upper hand politically, and is well worth fighting to implement.  A flat tax rate of 17 percent (preferably even lower), with no taxation of capital gains, interest earned, and dividends, would boost significantly crucial incentives to work, save, invest, and take risks.  	
<p>
In the long run, however, given the destructive nature and history of the income tax, economic freedom and independence for entrepreneurs and all citizens may only be guaranteed by eliminating the income tax, to be "replaced" by government spending cuts and a low retail sales levy of less than 10 percent.  Such a "dream" tax code, though, is not yet in the cards.  Today's revolution is not quite that revolutionary.

<center><i>September 1995</i><hr>
<h3>Stay Bullish - Cut & Index the Capital Gains Tax</h3> 
<b>by Raymond J. Keating<br> 
Chief Economist<br>
Small Business Survival Committee</b></center>	
<hr>
<P>
Since the Republicans seized control of Congress in the November 1994 elections, stock prices have been positively buoyant.  Indeed, between November 4, 1994 -- the Friday before election day -- to September 20, 1995, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose from 3807.52 to 4792.69 -- up over 25 percent.  The broader S&P 500 Index climbed from 462.28 to 586.77 -- up almost 27 percent.  The Nasdaq Composite  jumped from 766.08 to 1065.09 -- up almost 39 percent.	
<p>
One may be tempted to call this a Republican bull market.  In fact, that may be the case.  However, it is not party affiliation that matters, but the policies being pursued by those in elected (e.g., Congress and the President) and appointed (e.g., the Federal Reserve) offices.  The Republicans rode into Congress last November promising deregulation, smaller government, elimination of the budget deficit, and tax cuts.  While this combined package has no doubt influenced stock prices, maximum impact springs from the proposal to cut the capital gains tax rate from 28 percent to 19.8 percent and index capital gains for inflation.  It's basic Adam Smith economics -- higher potential profits attract investors.	
<p>
<b>Can't Afford Any Backsliding on Capital Gains.</b>  
<p>
Some faltering in the new Congress' "revolutionary" agenda can be detected.  Instead of eliminating four cabinet level departments as originally envisioned, a massive struggle is underway to eliminate just the Commerce Department.  Funding for the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and PBS lingers.  Indeed, overall federal government spending will continue to rise.  Much-needed reform of how the federal government regulates the private sector is stalled.  Repeal of the blatantly racist and costly Davis-Bacon Act is in serious doubt.  Such shortcomings will take a toll on the economy as well as on Republican political capital.  However, an inability to cut and index the capital gains tax would be the most damaging blow to entrepreneurship, investment and the economy.	
<p>
As the old saying goes, if you want less of something, tax it.  Investors have been counting on a lower, indexed capital gains tax since late last year.  This anticipation explains a good portion of the rise in stock prices during this period.  Failure to deliver on such a pro-entrepreneur tax cut would amount to a sharp blow to capital markets.  In particular, start-up and high-growth, high-tech enterprises would feel the most pain.  In the event of a failure to cut and index the capital gains tax, potential returns on such high-risk endeavors would be reduced and, therefore, so would equity prices.  The amount of capital available for investment would be far less under a higher, non-indexed capital gains tax rate -- indeed, by various estimates, trillions of dollars less.	
<p>
<b>Main Street vs. Wall Street?</b>  
<p>
Of course, opponents paint capital gains tax reduction as a rich-vs.-poor issue, or even as "Wall Street" vs. "Main Street."  Such a confrontation is mythical.  When the successful Main Street entrepreneur with a good idea needs capital to expand and create more jobs, he seeks out investors.  To do so, he often goes to Wall Street.  A lower, indexed capital gains tax -- that is, a higher potential return on capital -- makes it far easier to attract investors.	
<p>
What hurts Wall Street, hurts Main Street, and vice versa.  And of course, what helps one also helps the other.  The best way for federal officials to help would be the complete elimination of capital gains taxes.  Short of such a sound economic policy initiative, reducing the top capital gains tax rate to 19.8 percent and indexing for inflation will do quite nicely for now.	
<p>
<b>Again, the Importance of Retroactive Indexing.</b>  
<p>
As for indexing, its importance cannot be stressed enough.  This has been noted in previous SBSC publications.  The Senate is wavering on indexation.  The House has called only for prospective indexing (calculated from January 1, 1995) on assets held for at least three years.  To make sure that the real capital gains tax rate does not rise above 19.8 percent, that trillions of dollars are unlocked for new investment, and that resources find their way to their best uses, retroactive indexing must be passed and the three-year time limit for indexation eliminated.  	
<p>
The most pro-growth, pro-entrepreneur step this Congress could possibly muster this year is real, significant capital gains tax relief.  It also happens to be a good avenue for keeping a bull market chugging along.

<h3>First Step Toward Budget Sanity:<br> Eliminate the Commerce Department</h3> 
<b>by Raymond J. Keating<br> 
Chief Economist<br>
Small Business Survival Committee</b></center>	
<hr>
<P>

In fiscal year 1995, the U.S. federal government will spend an 
estimated $1.52 trillion.  By the year 2000, President Clinton's budget would see total outlays reach $1.91 trillion.  Even the more frugal House of Representatives Concurrent Resolution on the Budget -- Fiscal Year 1996 calls for spending to rise to $1.78 trillion by 2000.
<p>
This seemingly relentless march toward a $2-trillion federal budget 
needs to be halted.  The United States should be moving in the opposite direction -- downsizing the public sector and freeing up resources for productive, private-sector ventures.  A public-sector retreat -- making room for substantial tax cuts -- will allow the private sector and entrepreneurship to advance.  Real spending reduction means reversing course toward a $1-trillion federal government.
<p>
  Despite the cries from big-government and special-interest circles, much can be cut from the U.S. federal budget.  The Department of Energy, Department of Education, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Department of Transportation, the Small Business Administration, bloated welfare programs, and so many other areas of federal largess offer fertile ground for savings opportunities through considerable downsizing or outright elimination.  As the first major step, perhaps no other department deserves to be dismantled more than the U.S. Department of Commerce.
<p>
<b>The Grand Delusion</b>
<P>
Supporters of the Commerce Department, most prominently Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, claim that the department serves taxpayers and the economy well by increasing U.S. exports, seeding new technologies, and boosting economic growth.  Secretary Brown recently declared: "The work of this department is essential to the economic growth and well-being of this country."1  The Secretary even asserted at the White House Conference on Small Business on June 13, 1995 that the Commerce Department leveraged a "$250 million export promotion budget into $25 billion in overseas sales."  He also declared that an end to the Department's Manufacturing Extension Project would leave "America's 380,000 small manufacturers, with nearly twelve million employees, without accessible and supportive local extension programs providing up-to-date strategies and technologies."  
<P>
Such declarations are, to say the least, most difficult to believe.  After all, if America's small manufacturers relied on a government program for "up-to-date strategies and technologies" and exporters depended on Commerce bureaucrats to sell their wares, our economy today would be a third-world basketcase.  Brown and other Commerce Department proponents fall prey to the grand delusion of industrial policy.  
<P>
In reality, government does not possess the proper knowledge and incentives to be picking industry winners and losers; nor should taxpayer dollars be placed at risk in such futile endeavors.  As for expanding U.S. exports, a productive role for the government is limited to lowering trade barriers.  The Commerce Department should not be acting as the international marketing department for certain American businesses, with taxpayers, including other businesses, footing the bill.  And in terms of boosting economic growth, the economy would be far better served if taxes were cut -- boosting incentives to work, invest, and take risks -- and the Commerce Department terminated.  In the end, individuals buying, selling, creating, and investing in the marketplace always work better than government bureaucrats pushing paper and spending taxpayer dollars.
<P>
In addition to its bankrupt industrial-policy mission, the Commerce Department also serves as a "catch all" federal department.  It houses large governmental undertakings that have absolutely nothing to do with "commerce," such as the Bureau of the Census and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
<P>
<b>Commerce Budget</b>  
<P>
The taxpayers' price tag for the Commerce Department is by no means cheap.  Federal outlays for the Commerce Department in 1995 are estimated at $3.6 billion.  Figure 1 shows Commerce Department outlays since 1980 and Clinton Administration estimates for 1995 through 2000.
<P>
<b>Dismantling the Commerce Department</b>  
<P>
The U.S. Department of Commerce 
offers a clear opportunity to save taxpayer dollars.  The Commerce Department should be closed, with most of its duties terminated or privatized, and the remaining moved to other departments.  
<ul>
<li> The Bureau of the Census and all other economic and statistical analysis functions at the Commerce Department, at the very least, should be moved into an independent statistical agency, along with other statistical and data-collection functions undertaken by the federal government.  
<p>
However, Jim Miller, former budget director under President Ronald Reagan, offers an intriguing alternative for the Bureau of the Census.  He notes that while the Constitution requires a population census every 10 years, it does not say a government agency has to perform it.  Why not contract it out to a private firm?2  
<p>
<li> All economic development, travel and tourism, and technology programs should be privatized if possible, or otherwise terminated, including the Economic Development Administration, the Minority Business Development Agency, the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration,  Technology Administration, the National Technical Information Service, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and the National Telecommunications and Information Agency.
<p>
<li> End the federal government's roles as international marketing department for multinational firms, and a center for raising protectionist trade barriers against foreign goods.  The International Trade Administration should be closed.
<p>
<li> Legitimate trade activities -- such as negotiating, implementing, and enforcing free-trade accords -- should be moved to the Treasury Department.  The Bureau of Export Administration, though, with its responsibility for overseeing the export of goods that could impact national security, should be moved to the Department of Defense.
<p>
<li> The Patent and Trademark Office should be shifted to the Justice Department.
<p>
<li> As for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), much of this $2-billion behemoth should be privatized, with remaining duties shifted to other departments.  For example, the largest part of the NOAA's budget goes toward the National Weather Service.  Heritage Foundation economist Joe Cobb reports that roughly 300 private companies prepare and disseminate weather forecasts, with 85 percent of the American public receiving its weather forecasts from private meteorologists and for-profit companies.  The opportunity for substantial privatization is at hand.
</ul><P>
<p>
<b>A Revolution Needs Real Commitment.</b>  
<p>
The Republican Congress is sending out mixed signals on the Commerce Department.  Some only want to cut the Commerce budget, but leave the department in tact.  Others want to replace the Commerce Department with another, smaller cabinet-level agency, such as a Department of International Trade.  These half-measures should be abandoned.  
<p>
If our federal elected officials are serious about downsizing government, then the Commerce Department truly must be eliminated.  An inability to make the easy cuts -- like eliminating Commerce -- would bode ill for the more politically difficult, but clearly necessary cuts down the road.  House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Majority Leader Dick Armey issued a statement on July 26 declaring their "firm commitment to incorporate the [Commerce Department] dismantling legislation into the reconciliation bill."3  
<p>
This commitment to eliminate Commerce needs to be unequivocal if we are ever to bring some sanity back to the U.S. federal budget.  Otherwise, failure to kill the Department of Commerce would signal severe weakness and perhaps the end of a shortlived revolution.  <P><hr>

<h3>Clinton's Budding Trade War or Pacific Rim Free Trade?</h3> 
<b>by Raymond J. Keating<br> 
Chief Economist<br>
Small Business Survival Committee</b></center>	
<hr>
<P>
"The consumer is king."  This concept underlies the free enterprise system. While entrepreneurs drive the economy with their new ideas, innovations, products and services, they ultimately must submit their wares to the tests of the marketplace.  The entrepreneur must meet current consumer demands, create new demands, or fail trying.   	<p>
Of course, the consumer reaps enormous benefits.  Competition among producers lowers prices, expands choices, and enhances quality.  International suppliers of goods and services are a major factor in this process, providing greater competition.  This fact probably never has been so clearly illustrated than in the automobile industry.  In essence, the U.S. automobile industry was saved by foreign competition.  As cost and quality suffered in the 1970s and early 1980s, American consumers could look elsewhere for their transportation needs -- foreign automobile companies.  Naturally, U.S. consumers would have reaped even greater rewards had the government not imposed various trade barriers.  However, even somewhat limited competition forced American automobile producers to improve their products -- to meet the needs of the consumer.	Unfortunately, President Bill Clinton and U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Cantor seem ready to overthrow the  consumer as king, replacing him with managed-trade bureaucrats.  The looming threat of 100 percent tariffs on Japanese luxury car imports makes no economic sense.	<p>

Most absurd, the Clinton Administration wants the Japanese government to essentially guarantee market share for U.S. auto parts firms.  Imagine the fury in this nation, if the Japanese pressured the U.S. government to force private businesses to buy a certain amount of Japanese products.  To complete this strange scenario, the proposed 100 percent tariff on 13 Japanese luxury cars would be retroactive to May 20.  Retroactive taxes seem to be a favorite of this Administration -- the 1993 income tax hike was retroactive as well.<p>

A Tax Increase With All the Accompanying Evils.  One needs to remember that a tariff is a tax.  Consumers of Japanese luxury automobiles will face a 100 percent tax on their purchases, if President Clinton carries through with his tariff threat.  The end result of such an act would be to eliminate such vehicles from the U.S. marketplace -- limiting competition and consumer choices.	<p>

The Administration once again is playing the class warfare card, as it did with its 1993 tax increase.  After all, some people say so what if some wealthy individuals will have to either pay a exorbitant tax or consider purchasing a non-Japanese luxury car.  Of course, we all have heard such faulty reasoning before -- such as with the 1990 federal budget deal, which included a luxury tax on yachts.  Of course, the rich were not soaked, but the businesses and the employees who built the boats were devastated.  If the Clinton tax increase on Japanese luxury cars goes into effect on June 28, the hardest impact will be felt by U.S. importers, car dealers, and their employees.	<p>

Indeed, tens of thousands of jobs would be placed in jeopardy.  As 
reported by The Washington Times, 8,000 Americans work in Lexus dealerships and 10,000 in Acura dealerships.  In addition to Lexus and Acura models, Mitsubishi, Mazda, and Infiniti models would fall prey to Clinton's tariffs.  If implemented, these tariffs would be a clear instance where higher taxes closed businesses and placed individuals on the unemployment lines.  The Japanese import car industry asserts that as many as 81,000 jobs would be placed at risk.	An even wider threat looms for the U.S. economy, i.e., Japanese retaliation against U.S. exports.  Japan is the United States' second largest trading partner.  As we all supposedly learned from the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, protectionism hurts everyone in the end.<p>

<b>A Matter of Opening or Serving the Japanese Market?</b><P>
  While most Americans assume that the Japanese market is shut as tight as a clam -- especially in the area of automobiles -- this issue actually remains open to question.  For example, the U.S. may have a point regarding restrictions pertaining to access to Japanese car dealerships.  However, U.S. automakers have never been aggressive in establishing their own dealer networks in Japan.<P>

	More important is the question of supplying autos the Japanese want to drive.  As noted earlier, in order to succeed, a business must meet current or create new consumer demands.  U.S. critics of Japanese trade policies often resort to market share arguments.  That is, since U.S. automakers have captured such small market share in Japan (about 1.6 percent of the new-car market and 1.4 percent of the auto-parts market, according to Investor's Business Daily, June 16, 1995), severe trade barriers must exist.  However, other forces are clearly at work.

<P>For example, the Japanese drive on the left side of the road, 
as a result Japanese consumers are partial (obviously) to right-hand-drive vehicles.  The Economist reported in its June 17, 1995 issue that only two American car models -- in a total of three versions -- come with right-hand drive in Japan.  Meanwhile, the number of models of left-hand-drive Japanese cars in America equals 68, available in a total of 179 different versions.  One easily could conclude that U.S. automakers need to work much harder to meet the demands of Japanese consumers.<p>

<b>"Drop Your Gun, or I'll Shoot!"</b><P>

  Even if we assume that trade barriers remain the largest obstacle to U.S. autos and auto parts in Japan, why punish U.S. consumers?  Whenever a politician threatens to impose retaliatory tariffs on imports, I am reminded of those movie scenes where a character grabs an innocent bystander during a gunfight, puts a gun to that person's head, and yells to his opponent, "Drop your gun, or I'll shoot!"	 <p>

During trade wars, the innocent bystanders with economic guns pointed at their heads are consumers.  Just because the Japanese government may be treating their consumers rather shabbily is no excuse for the U.S. government to treat its consumers the same way.  The U.S. already imposes myriad tariffs and quotas that cost consumers billions of dollars annually.  Indeed, the U.S. is not exactly friendly to many Japanese auto imports, imposing quotas and a 25-percent tariff on imported trucks.  Rather than increasing such penalties, the U.S. should be lowering barriers to trade.<P>

<b>Free Trade on the Pacific Rim</b><P>
  Trade seemed to be the one area of the economy where President Clinton showed some leadership and economic understanding.  Though not perfect, NAFTA and GATT were major steps in the right direction.  Rather than issuing threats, raising trade barriers, circumventing the World Trade Organization (which Clinton helped establish to settle trade disputes), and perhaps creeping toward a full-scale trade war, President Clinton should reassert his leadership on the world scene as an advocate of free trade, and push for a Pacific Rim free trade agreement.  	<P>

The President certainly has struggled on the foreign policy front, including such hotbeds as Somalia, Bosnia and Chechnya.  Not to mention that after pushing for NAFTA, his administration helped to devastate Mexico's economy by assisting the Mexican government with its wrongheaded peso devaluation and bungled policies thereafter.  The President may believe that there are political points to be scored by taking on Japan.  <P>

However, any benefits will be shortlived since his actions are so transparent.  Indeed, The New York Times observed on its editorial page (May 18, 1995) in reference to the President's threatened tariffs on Japanese luxury cars: "It seems designed more to mend the President's relations with American unions than to resolve trade differences with Japan."  <P>

Reasserting U.S. commitment to free trade -- by example rather than by threats -- would bolster the U.S. internationally.<P>

	A free trade initiative for the Pacific Rim would change the course of American-Japanese trade negotiations -- moving away from the threat of a trade war and toward a freer, growing international marketplace.  The President has mentioned support for such an initiative in the past, but now seems to be going off in a far different, economically dangerous direction.  For the sake of the economy, he needs to get back on the free-trade track, and a Pacific Rim initiative makes particular sense at this time.  	<P>

Unfortunately, if Clinton fails to move in this direction, there are 
few signals emanating from Republicans in Congress to indicate that they understand the issue much better.  Indeed, Republicans have been eerily silent in regards to the President's threats against Japan and, effectively, against U.S. consumers.  Indeed, some Republicans have voiced support.<P>

<b>Free Trade: Providing Opportunities for America's Entrepreneurs</b>
<P>
  A recent article in Investor's Business Daily noted that the Japanese were coming to the United States to study entrepreneurship.  A Pacific Rim free trade agreement would grant them first-hand experience.  Tearing down trade barriers around the Pacific would create enormous opportunities for American business and entrepreneurs; consumers would reap great rewards; and economic growth would receive a hearty boost.<P>

	U.S. consumers, as well as businesses and employees working in the U.S. import industry, should not be sacrificed to misguided, politically driven trade policies.  Free trade works best, and the U.S. should reclaim global leadership on this issue.

<title>Capital Gains and the U.S. Senate</title>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
May 1995<p>
 
<center>
<h2>Capital Gains and the U.S. Senate</h2>
by Raymond J. Keating 
Chief Economist 
Small Business Survival Committee
</center><p>
<hr>
 
<i>"Upward mobility is what America is all about, and the ability to access and accumulate capital -- an ability undermined by the capital gainst tax -- is the stairway by which people move up."</i><p>
<p>
--Jack Kemp, The Washington Time, 5/2/95<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>"Experience indicates that lower capital gains taxes have a positive impace on federal revenues.  The most 
impressive evidence involves the period from 1978 to 1985.  During those years the marginal federal tax 
rate on capital gains was cut from almost 50 percent to 20 percent -- but total individual capital gains tax 
receipts increased from $9.1 billion to $26.5 billion."</i><p>
<p>
--American Council for Capital Formation, January 1995<p>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
	In 1989, then-Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D-ME) single-handedly killed a capital gains tax cut.  Mitchell's dedication to class warfare and blind-eye towards the benefits for all capital -- income levels from capital gains tax reduction cost the economy untold growth and opportunity -- businesses that were never created or expanded, new jobs never added to the economy, and products and services never made available to consumers.<p>

	President George Bush refused to make another serious push for capital gains tax reduction.  
Indeed, he sacrificed his no-new-taxes pledge and ultimately his presidency the following year by signing 
on to a deficit reduction package that raised taxes, failed to actually cut spending, and didn't reduce the 
deficit.<p>

	Today we have a new Congress looking to do buisness in a new way.  the House of 
Representatives has passed a tax cut package -- including capital gains tax rate reduction (top rate of 19.8 percent for individuals and 25 percent for corporations) and indexing gains for inflation.  Indexing capital gains and reducing the capital gains tax rate was by far the most pro-growth plank in the House 
Republicans' "Contract with America."  For the small buisness, entrepreneurial sector of the economy, 
capital gains tax reduction means greater access to capital for investment and growth.  If America truly has a new Senate in 1995, then the mistakes of 1989 will not be repeated and capital gains tax reduction will be enacted.<p>

<b>Tax Cuts for Growth and Spending Cuts for Deficit Reduction</b> However, some Senators seem to be unable to grasp the concept that cutting taxes and reducing the deficit can be achieved simultaneously.  Many claim such actions to be contradictory.  They are not.  The supply-side economics concept of "policy levers" can help to make this clearer.<p>

	Briefly, the policy lever concept states that policies should directed at the area of the economy where they hold a comparative advantage.  For example, the lone goal of monetary policy, or the monetary lever, should be to achieve price stability.  Meanwhile, the fiscal lever should be geared toward promoting economic growth by enhancing incentives for working, saving, investing, and entrepreneurship.  Misunderstanding how the economy works, old-line Keynesian economists claim that such actions are contradictory.  Yet, tight money and tax cuts in the 1980s cured stagflation and placed the U.S. economy on a robust growth path.<p>
 
	Likewise, the concept of policy levers can help us with the current dilemma regarding tax cuts and the deficit.  As noted, the fiscal lever should be positioned to promote growth.  Therefore, reducing capital gains tax rates and indexing returns for inflation makes sense -- i.e., the tax lever should be moved in a pro-growth direction.  Meanwhile, the spending lever should then be adjusted so as to deal with the deficit.  Quite simply, if the fiscal lever is going to promote economic growth, then taxes must be cut and deficits dealt with through spending cuts.<p>
 
	Tax increases only work to slow economic growth, thereby boosting government spending, 
shrinking the tax base, and actually expanding the deficit.  Meanwhile, pro-growth tax cuts along with 
spending restraint amount to the most sensible fiscal policy -- the combination of a growing economy, an expanding tax base, and prudent spending policies will shrink the deficit.<p>
 
	Tax cuts and deficit reduction do not have to be mutually exclusive.  The formula for sound fiscal policy is clear: tax cuts for economic growth and spending cuts for deficit reduction.<p>
 
<b>Boosting Entrepreneurship.</b>  Make no mistake, shifting tax policy into a growth mode through capital gains tax rate reduction and indexing, while reducing government spending, will serve to boost the small business, entrepreneurial sector of the economy -- where job creation occurs.  Indeed, considering that access to capital remains probably the biggest obstacle for small business and entrepreneurs, it is difficult to think of a more damaging levy to small business than the capital gains tax.  Entrepreneurs need capital to start up new businesses, to expand existing enterprises, and to create jobs.</p>
 
	<i>In effect, capital gains tax reduction is the best "jobs program" government can institute.</i>
 
	If the Senate wants to ensure that entrepreneurs gain access to capital, then it will:  
 
<ul>

<li>Reduce the top capital gains tax rate to 19.8 percent on individuals, as the House did (the 
corporate rate on capital gains would drop to 25 percent); 

<li>Index gains for inflation.  Unfortunately, the House tax cut only allows for indexing from the 
beginning of 1995, no matter when the asset was acquired.  The Senate should provide for full indexing for inflation from the time the asset actually was acquired, and insist on this in joint conference with the 
House.  Full indexing would unlock trillions of dollars of capital for investment in new and expanding 
businesses.
</ul>
<p>
	In the end, however, Congress should shift the fiscal policy lever into full growth mode by 
eliminating capital gains taxes altogether.<p>

<title>Stop Government Hostile Takeovers of Family Businesses</title>

<h2>Stop Government Hostile Takeovers of</h2>
<h2>Family Businesses: Repeal the Estate Tax</h2>
</center>

<hr>
<i>"Interestingly, for a tax that is supposed to inflict such little pain, people have devoted a great deal of ingenuit to getting around [the estate tax]."</i><p>

-- Economist Bruce Bartlett in his book  Reaganomics<p>


<i>"The U.S. is virtually the only country in the world that imposes significant income and death taxes on the worldwide income and assets of every citizen, even if the citizen is domiciled elsewhere."</i><p>

--Robert Lenzner and Phillippe Mao, "The New Refugees," Forbes 11/221/94<p>


<i>"It's basically cheaper to give away a business than to die owning it."</i><p>

--Frank Rainaldi quoted Investor's Buisness Daily, 4/12/95<p>
<hr>

	At various points in the history of modern-day capitalism, concerns have been raised regarding hostile takeovers of business entities.  Worries over general corporate instability, excessive debt, and job losses often arise when an individual or firm attempts seize the reins of a corporation against the wishes of current management.  In fact, though, hostile takeovers remain a source of dynamism in a free enterprise system -- often removing moribund, inefficient management, finding ways to add value and increase production, and boosting the economy.<p>

	<i>One kind of hostile takeover distinctly anti-free enterprise, though, and worthy of harsh criticism is the federal estate tax, along with the gift and generation-skipping taxes.</i>  After working hard, paying taxes, and establishing a business over a lifetime, thegovernment moves in to claim up to 60 percent of an individual's assets upon death -- a hostile takeover, if you will.  And a target for government raiders under the guise of the estate tax are family businesses.<p>

<b>Insurance to Pay Taxes.</b>  To fend off such government takeovers, family business owners channel large amounts of resources into relatively unproductive endeavors in order to pass business on to the next generation.  Legions of accountants explore creative ways to shield assets from death taxes.  Indeed, individuals may purchase life insurance for the sole purpose of paying estate taxes. Insurance is not cheap, however, and remains out of reach for many individuals working hard to keep their businesses afloat, or if purchased, diverts resources away from productive investment.  A clear indication of a tax system gone awry is when insurance is being bought to cover the costs of taxation.<p>

<b>Killing Businesses.</b>  Most often, the need to pay estate taxes winds up killing family-owned businesses.  In fact, 60 percent of family-owned businesses fail to make it to the second generation, and 90 percent do not make it to the third generation.<a href="#foot1">1</a>  Estate taxes in play a significant role in this development.  Perhaps most detrimental is the fact that the government is stripping a company of much-needed capital at the worst possible juncture -- under a change of ownership and oversight. Most businesses simply never recover.<p>

	Heavy estate taxation also acts as a disincentive for investment and entrepreneurship, just as onerous income and capital gains taxes do.  With 55 percent of a business enterprise essentially slated for a government takeover, there remains little incentive for individuals to continue to invest and expand a family business when the owner reaches a certain age.  Rather, business owners possess every incentive to sell their family businesses before death to spare their heirs the costs and burdens of a hostile government takeover via estate taxes.<p>

<b>Tax Rates.</b>  Federal estate tax rates range effectively from 37 percent up to 55 percent, plus an additional 5 percent on very large estates.  <i>It is important to understand the fact that this is not 55 percent of income, it is 55 percent of all assets in an estate.</i>  The first $600,000 is exempt from taxation.  (The Contract with America proposal, which recently passed the U.S. House of Representatives, increases the estate tax exemption to $750,000.)<p>

	The gift tax is levied at the same rates as the estate tax, excluding $10,000 per recipient annually.  In addition, a generation-skipping tax is imposed on gifts and bequests to grandchildren.  The generation-skipping tax is levied at an additional, flat rate of 55 percent on amounts in excess of $1 million.<p>

<b>Tax Revenues.</b>  As is always the case when government pushes tax rates too high, tax revenues are relatively insignificant.  As already noted, high estate tax rates intensify tax avoidance efforts and create disincentives for investment, saving, and entrepreneurship.  <i>In 1994, estate and gift taxes accounted for a mere 1.2 percent of total federal government receipts, or $15.2 billion.  Between 1974 and 1994, there has been virtually no inflation-adjusted increase in federal estate and gift tax revenues (only a 0.6 percent increase).</i>  In addition, a good portion of these revenues are eaten up by the federal government's compliance efforts related to estate and other death taxes -- some estimates say as much as 75 percent of estate and gift tax collections are offset by the costs of the IRS, the Treasury Department, and litigation.<a href="#foot2">2</a><p>

<b>Economic Growth and Job Creation.</b>  In the 1970s, Australia and Canada repealed their estate taxes.  While not exactly bastions of free-market economics, both these nations came to realize that estate levies were hurting investment, economic growth and job creation.

	In the most extreme cases, the U.S. tax structure has pushed many upper-income individuals to reject their citizenship, taking up official residence in less-taxing lands.  Again, estate taxes play a major part in such decisions.  <i>Forbes</i> magazine ran a cover story about such individuals entitled "The New Refugees" in its November 21, 1994 issue.  While some might say, "Good riddance to such traitors," the economics underlying the situation should be reviewed.<p>

	A simple question arises: Why does the U.S. impose such a punitive tax code to the point where productive individuals will take the dramatic step of renouncing their citizenship in order to prosper elsewhere? Though the problem of taxing productive individuals out of a country is not new one.  In the late eighteenth century, the great economist Adam Smith warned in <i>The Wealth of Nations</i>:

	<blockquote>"The proprietor of stock is properly a citizen of the world, and is not necessarily attached to any particular country.  He would be apt to abandon the country in which he was exposed to a vexatious inquisition, in order to be assessed to a burdensome tax, and would remove his stock to some other country where he could either carry on his business, or enjoy his fortune more at his ease.  By removing his stock he would put an end to all the industry which it had maintained in the country which he left."</blockquote>

This observation takes on even greater significance considering today's worldwide competition for increasingly mobile capital -- made even more mobile through global electronic transfers of funds.<p>

	A 1993 study by the Center for the Study of Taxation estimated the economic impact of repealing estate taxes in the United States.  The study estimated that under a no-estate-tax scenario by the year 2000, GDP would be $79.2 billion higher, 228,000 more jobs would be created, and $630 billion more in savings and capital would accumulate.<p>

<b>End Government Hostile Takeovers.</b>  In the private sector, a hostile takeover often means that the owners (i.e., shareholders) of the targeted company will benefit as their shares in the firm increase in price.  Under the government's hostile takeovers of thousands of family-owned businesses each year via the estate and other death taxes, heirs are decimated as the government often lays claim to more than half the company's assets.  Resources are funneled away from productive, private-sector ventures to often-dubious, unproductive government programs.<p>

	The only justification for estate taxes is envy -- a desire to perpetuate class warfare and worn-out, failed government redistribution schemes.  But as we all know, envy is a poor foundation upon which to base a tax code.  Sound economics is preferable.  The economics of estate taxes tells us that such levies create disincentives to invest, save, and take risks; reduce economic growth and job creation; and are expensive to administer. The time has come to repeal the estate and other death taxes in the United States.  Government's hostile takeovers of family businesses and assets must come to an end.  If not, the government will continue to destroy America's free enterprise system and our great heritage of family-owned businesses.<p>

<title>The Facts About Capital Gains Tax Reduction</title>

<h2>The Facts About Capital Gains Tax Reduction</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<i>"History shows that class warfare does not make for good economic policy."</i><p>

-- Sydney Hoff-Hay, SBSC Board Member, in testimony before the U.S. House Committee on Small Business, 1/26/95.<p>


<i>"While I fully support the elimination of the capital gains tax, the reduction and indexation ... in the Contract With America would result in lower capital costs, increased capital formation, new and higher-paying jobs, and increased investment in start-up enterprises, as well as business expansions."</i><p>

-- Richard Rahn, Ph.D., SBSC Board Member, in testimony before the U.S. House Committee on Small Business, 2/22/95.<p>


<i>"As long as risk-taking is punished, growth will be smothered.... I genuinely believe we will open the 21st century without a tax on capital gains, as we opened the 20th century."</i><p>

--Jude Wanniski, economist, before the U.S. Senate, 2/15/95.<p>
<hr>

	Much-needed capital gains tax reduction has been placed on hold since then-Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell almost single-handedly killed it in 1989. During the 1992 campaign, thenpresidential candidate Bill Clinton mentioned the possibility of indexing capital gains for inflation. Nevertheless, President Clinton has voiced opposition to capital gains tax reduction.<p>

Finally, the House Republican "Contract With America" called for significant capital gains tax reduction -- a 50 percent capital gains exclusion from taxation, effectively dropping the top tax rate for individuals from 28 percent to 19.8 percent, and prospective indexing for inflation. At a minimum, <i>the Small Business Survival Committee supports the Houseplanfor capital gains tax reduction, but urges the complete elimination of capital gains taxes.</i><p>

Our bold stance on the capital gains front is based on the facts, which are so often left out of the capital gains tax debate:<p>

<b>Improved Incentives for Investment and Entrepreneurship.</b> Investment and entrepreneurship are the driving forces behind economic growth and job creation. The economy needs individuals who are willing to undertake the great risks of investing sweat and/or capital in new and expanding businesses -- cssentially in new ideas.<p>

	Capital gains taxes raise the costs of such enterprises -reducing potential returns, and thereby reducing risk taking, investment, and economic growth. <i>Basic economics tells us that cutting or eliminaneg the capital-gains tax will enhance incentivesfor investment and entrepreneurship.</i><p>

<b>Widespread Benefits.</b> Critics of capital gains tax reduction illustrate great ignorance when asserting that a capital gains tax cut "will only benefft the rich."<p>

	<i>First</i>, improving incentives for investment and entrepreneurship has widespread economic benefits -- greater competition, more products and services for consumers, greater economic growth, and <i>more jobs</i>. After all, employees need employers. Providing incentives for individuals to expand existing businesses or to create new enterprises is the engine of job creation.  Absurdly, critics seem to think that individuals and the economy somehow benefit from taking resources away from venture capitalists, investors, and entrepreneurs, and giving it to the government.  <i>The problem remains that while government can redistribute, and even destroy, it cannot create</i>.<p>

	Second, capital gains are spread across a wide income spectrum.  According to 1992 federal income tax returns (most recent available), 56 percent of returns claiming capital gains were from incomes of $50,000 or less, 73 percent of returns with capital gains were from incomes of less than $75,000, while incomes of less than $100,000 claimed 83 percent of returns with capital gains.<p>

	Third, any discussion of which income levels derive direct benefits from capital gains tax reduction will be misleading because capital gains are included in the measurement of income.  Therefore, individuals who perhaps claim one-time or very infrequent capital gains income can be launched into a considerably higher income bracket <i>for only the year in which the capital gain is claimed</i>.  Opponents of capital gains tax cuts misleadingly claim that the rich capture the benefits of tax cuts without mentioning the facts about income measurement.<p>

	<i>Fourth</i>, even if <i>all</i> the direct benefits of capital gains tax reduction accrued to the "rich" -- which they do not -- one must ask: Who possesses better incentives to invest money more wisely, a rich person investing his own money or a government bureaucrat spending the taxpayers' money?<p>

<b>Double Taxation</b>.  Capital gains taxes represent a form of double taxation,  Individuals pay taxes on income they earn, and then choose to either save, invest, or consume their after-tax dollars.  The federal government does not tax consumption, but certainly does tax the benefits of saving and investing.  <i>Eliminating capital gains taxes, as well as taxes on interest earned from saving, alleviates the bias against saving and investment</i>.<p>

<b>Equalizing Tax Treatment of Capital Gains with Government Debt</b>.  Interest on most state and local government debt instruments are not subject to federal taxation, while capital gains are taxed.  This tax structure makes no economic sense.  Government securities present few risks for investors, while investments in private-sector equities, business expansion, and new enterprises offer considerable risks.  In addition, government debt generally finances rather unproductive government projects and programs, while capital gains are generated by successful private-sector enterprises that boost the economy, expand the tax base, and create real jobs.  <i>Clearly, capital gains income should receive the same tax treatment as interest on state and local government debt</i>.<p>

<b>Capital Gains Tax Reduction and Federal Tax Revenues</b>.  Static government analyses project revenue losses from capital gains tax reduction.  However, as the top tax rate on capital gains declined from almost 50 percent to 20 percent between 1978 and 1985, capital gains tax receipts <i>increased</i> from $9.1 billion to $26.5 billion.<a href="#foot1">1</a>  In contrast, the 1986 Tax Reform Act hiked the capital gains tax rate by 40 percent -- from 20 percent to 28 percent -- but by 1992 capital gains tax revenues registered about the same amount as were collected in 1985 (far less in real terms).  Naturally, the increase in the capital gains tax rate resulted in far lower capital gains realizations.<p>

	After all, the economy is dynamic, not static.  Therefore, individuals will alter their economic behavior according to the incentives established by governmental policies.  Even the complete elimination of capital gains taxes on individuals does not mean that the federal government will lose all of the $26 billion or so it collects from this levy because investment and entrepreneurship will respond positively, spurring growth and creating revenue feedback for the federal government through other levies.<p>

<b>International Treatment of Capital Gains</b>.  Most of our top international competitors -- including Japan and Germany -- do not tax capital gains as harshly as the U.S. does.  In fact, <i>nations like Hong Kong, the Netherlands, and Germany do not tax capital gains income at all</i>.<p>

	Even nations like Great Britain and Australia who tax capital gains at 40 percent and 48.3 percent, respectively -- higher rates than the U.S. -- adjust asset prices for inflation.  Once inflation is factored into the equation, the <i>real</i> U.S. capital gains tax rate jumps much higher than the stated rate of 28 percent -- often well in excess of 50 percent.  In fact, many U.S. taxpayers wind up paying taxes on <i>real</i> capital losses.<p>

	In addition, most states and some cities levy their own capital gains taxes -- pushing the total capital gains tax rate even higher.<p>

<b>Unlocking Past Gains and Improving Economic Efficiency</b>.  Literally trillions of dollars are locked into investments at present because high tax rates, especially after adjusting for inflation, create significant disincentives for investors to sell.  <i>Eliminating capital gains taxes would unlock huge amounts of capital -- that are artificially locked in because of current tax treatment of capital gains income -- to be reinvested in new and growing ventures</i>.

	When one moves past the class warfare rhetoric and nonsensical arguments against capital gains tax reduction, the economics are clear.  <i>Sharply reducing or eliminating capital gains taxes increases potential returns on investment and entrepreneurship, thereby promoting economic growth and job creation</i>.

<h2>Competition and Common Sense:</h2>
<h2>The Two Essential Ingredients for Constructive</h2>
<h2>Health Care Reform</h2>

By Raymond J. Keating
</center>
<hr>

<i>"Anyone familiar with my career in public service knows I strongly favor the social goals of relieving poverty and enhancing the quality of life for all people.  Not one American should be denied access to health care.  But in trying to collect the costs from business, we assume every employer can effectively play a national version of the street corner shell game, with the consumer paying the bill.  But consumers have choices and some businesses have real limitations on what they can charge for products or services.  When government is unmindful of these dynamics, it often means loss of employment for those we seek to help."<p>
</i>
--George McGovern, Insight, 4/26/93<p>


<i>"According to ... the CATO Institute, MSAs would lower the nation's annual health care bill by $33 billion"</i><p>

--National Center for Policy Analysis, Health Care Briefing Book<p>

<hr>

	The misguided effort by President and Mrs. Clinton to further inject government into the U.S. health care system thankfully died in 1994.  However, the underlying struture that makes health care so costly still lives on -- i.e., an expanded definition of "insurance," the prevailing use of third-party payments, and government regulations which prevent innovative methods for making health care affordable and accessible.  in addition, self-employed entrepreneurs and uninsured individuals are not given equal tax treatment in terms of their health care expenditures as is received by employer-based insurance plans.<p>

	In order to control costs, increase choices, and further enhance quality, <i>market-based</i> health care reforms are needed.  The byer-seller relationsh8ip between consumers and suppliers of health care services needs to be re-established.  Under a thrd-party system of payments, neither consumer nor provider have an incentive to be concerned about costs.  Therefore, costs naturally rise.<p>

	There are two veins to thise thrid-party payment system.  First, government involvement in the health care market has increased, especially since the inception of Medicaid and Medicare in the mid-1960s.  Second, the concept of "insurance" has been vastly expanded. By definition, insurance is supposd to cover  catastrophic and unforeseen events.  Today, health insurance plans cover small and predictable expenses.  Such a perversion of health insurance would be the equivalent of extending one's home-owners insurance to cover the costs of mowing the law, trimming and painting the house.<p>

	Make no mistakes, third-party payments have increased dramatically over the past three decades.  For example, according to economist Ed Rebenstein in his book <i>Right Data</i>, in 1950 government fianced 25.3 percent of health care expenditures, private insurance 15.8 percent, and 58.9 percentcovered out of pocket.  As of 1965, government's share had risen to 26.2 percent, private insurance rose to 28.1 percent, while out-of-pocket fiancing fell to 45.7 percent.  By 1990, government fianced health care expenditures reached 42.4 percent, private insurance hit 37.2 percent, with out-of-pocket fiancing falling to a mere 20.4 percent.  According to the <i>Statistical Abstract of the United States</i> 1994, in 1991, government fianced expenditures equaled 43.9 percent, private insurance and other private sources 36.9 percent, and 19.2 percent out of pocket.<p>

	The effect of this usurpation of the buyer-seller relationship has been clear -- rising costs.  For example, per capita U.S. health care expenditures between 1965 and 1991 increased by 1,306 percent, versus a rise in the consumer price index of 332 percent.<p>

	The Small Business Survival Committee believes that two reform measures by the 104th Congress and the Administration would go a long way in curing what ails the health care marketplace.<p>

<b>Medical Savings Accounts.</b> Incentives need to be established so that individuals can save to cover the costs of standard, predictable health care expenses out of pocket, while also purchasing catastrophic health care insurance.  Allowing individuals to establish tax-free medical savings accounts (MSAs) would provide the basis for such a system.<p>

	The most common MSA scenario would have employers and employees shifting payments from a standard health plan to a split system of an MSA and a catastrophic plan.  For example, a standard plan costing $5,000 could be replaced with $3,000 going into an employee's MSA ($2,500 from the employer and $500 from the employee) and $2,000 covering a catastrophic plan with a $3,000 deductible.<p>

	The employee withdraws funds from the MSA, penalty free, to pay out-of-pocket medical expenses.  Since the employee has an established "budget" and is able to keep what he does not use by the end of the year, the employee has an incentive to spend more prudently and comparison shop for health care purchases.  After all, <i>the critical issue in making health care more accessible is to make it more affordable.</i>  If consumers become more concerned with costs, health care providers are forced to be more cost sensitive in pricing health care services.<p>

	Also, many individuals would be able to build up a large amount of savings in their MSAs, which in turn would help offset health care costs in case the employee lost his job.  Such a plan could be designed to help the poor as well -- eventually replacing Medicaid, and its daunting bureaucracy and costs, with health care vouchers that could be deposited in MSAs.  Again, this would go a long way in helping to alleviate some of the high costs associated with third-party payers, in the case of Medicaid, the government.<p>

	In places where MSA plans already are being tried, the results have been quite positive.  For example:<p>

<ul>
<li>A recent study (January 11, 1995) by the Evergreen Freedom Foundation in Olympia, Washington reviewed MSA plans currently in use.  They found that the use of MSAs generated "reduced health care spending by sponsors/employers and employees; wiser use of health services by consumers; greater use of preventive services; increased consumer involvement in health care decisions and purchases; dollar savings and improved choice for healthy and ill people; MSA preference by low-income employees; [and] strong employee participation and satisfaction."

<li>Also, the Evergreen report noted that the MSA plan instituted by Forbes, Inc. has reduced insurance premiums by 27 percent since 1991.

<li>According to a survey by The Luntz Research Companies, 98 percent of the employees at Golden Rule Insurance (Indianapolis, Indiana) enrolled in the companyÕs MSA plan are satisfied with the program.  Ninety percent of Golden RuleÕs employees have chosen to enroll in the plan, with the average enrollee accumulating $1,002 in refunds in 1994.  About half of those receiving refunds planned to spend the money on living expenses, holiday gifts and other items, while the other half planned on keeping their money in an interest-bearing MSA reserve account or investing the money in other ways.  Total employee refunds for 1993 and 1994 amounted to $1.2 million.  In addition, for the second straight year using MSAs, Golden Rule has had no rate increase.
</ul><p>

<b>Equalized Tax Treatment of Health Care Expenditures for the Self-Employed and Uninsured.</b>  The current tax system allows full tax deductibility for employer-provided health insurance, but denies such treatment to out-of-pocket health care expenditures and self-employed individuals.  In order to ensure that individuals and entrepreneurs can afford health care, their health care expenses -- whether for insurance or out-of-pocket payments -- should be allowed full tax deductibility.<p>

	The current system of only allowing full tax deductibility for employer-provided insurance benefits larger companies and their employees, leaving entrepreneurs and uninsured workers behind.  Extending 100-percent deductibility to entrepreneurs merely levels the playing field.  In turn, full deductibility may help to foster entrepreneurship.  Many individuals are unwilling to undertake the risks of starting a new business because once they leave the security of being an employee in an established firm, they may lose health care benefits.  Allowing for 100-percent deductibility would give an added incentive for individuals to start their own businesses.<p>

	Unbelievably, Congress and the Administration even allowed the 25-percent deduction for health insurance premiums paid by the self-employed to expire last year.  As a first step, Congress should reinstate this 25-percent deduction immediately (which will still require many individuals to file amended tax returns), and then phase in the 100-percent deduction.<p>

	
	MSAs and full tax deductibility for individuals and entrepreneurs are the kind of market-oriented health care reform measures that will provide greater access to care, enhanced choice for health care consumers, while providing incentives to control costs.  Health care reform may be the arena where the degree of real change brought about by this past election will be measured.  In fact, House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer (R-Tx.) is expected to introduce a bill shortly that will include MSAs.<p>

	A government-driven health care plan is one of a primary reason that the Clinton Administration is taking on water.  Market-driven health care reforms could buoy the new Congress.<p>

<title>Eliminating Capital Gains Taxes</title>

<h2>Eliminating Capital Gains Taxes:<br>
Lifeblood for an Entrepreneurial Economy</h2><p>
by Raymond J. Keating<p>
</center>
<hr>

<i>"[W]e have to cut the rate on capital gains, which is ... a vacuum sucking up our capital savings into the general treasury."<p></i>

-- U.S. Rep. Bill Archer.<p>
<p>

<i>"Better yet, eliminate capital-gains taxes entirely."</i><p>

-- Ed Rubenstein, Economics Analyst, National Review<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>"Investors are naturally reluctant to support new ventures in decaying urban neighborhoods where theft, drug abuse, violent crime and buisness bankruptcy rates are all very high.  This source of venture capital will not be tapped until sufficient incentives make inner-city investment more attractive to individual backers.  Conversely, reducing the tax on capital gains effectively increases the flow of fiancial 'seed corn' to budding entrepreneurs."<p>
</i>
-- Wall Street Journal op-ed, 8/25/93, by the chairman and four members of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights.<p>
<p>
<hr>
Most entrepreneurs seeking to start up or expand an enterprise will tell you of a major obstacle -- raising capital.  The answer to this problem is not a proliferation of governmental entities siphoning taxpayer funds to fledgling businesses.  Instead, encouragement for private-sector investment in small business needs to be enhanced.<p>

Investment and entrepreneurship are the lifeblood of a vibrant economy.  There is no more important economic task than investing both	sweat and capital in new ideas, innovations, and enterprises.  Yet, the risky nature of such ventures often scares off bank lending officers.  Therefore, venture capital, whether raised from one's family and friends or from professional investors, remains a critical source of funding for entrepreneurial enterprises.<p>

In the economic world of risk-and-reward tradeoffs, the <i>opportunity</i> for high returns must be present in order to entice investment in such high-risk ventures.  Capital gains taxes significantly cut into those returns, thereby diminishing incentives to invest.<p>

The Republican majorities in both houses of the new Congress are considering a reduction in the federal capital gains tax rate, and indexing the rate for inflation.  These are crucial steps to igniting entrepreneurship and investment in the U.S. economy, and thereby stimulating economic growth and job creation.  Though, <i>in order to make the United States a capital haven and an economic-growth juggernaut, taxes on capital gains should be eliminated altogether.</i><p>

<h3>Indexation</h3>

The nominal rate of federal taxation on capital gains income is 28 percent.<a href="#foot1">1</a>   However, when inflation is factored into the capital gains equation the <i>real</i> capital gains tax rate rises substantially.<p>

For example, an individual that made a $10,000 venture capital investment in 1987, and sold it for $15,000 in 1993, would owe $1,400 in federal capital gains taxes at the 28 percent rate.  However, when factoring inflation (we use the gross domestic product deflator) into this equation, the real capital gains tax rate on this transaction jumps to 53 percent.<a href="#foot2">2</a><p>

The lack of indexation creates additional disincentives for investment and entrepreneurship, restraining small-business growth and job creation.  In fact, some individuals can wind up paying taxes on <i>real capital losses</i>.  That is, after factoring inflation into the equation, a nominal profit on a transaction can turn out to be a real loss, yet the investor still pays taxes on the nominal gain.<p>

Depending on the Federal Reserve's success in maintaining stable prices, the real capital gains tax rate can fluctuate considerably as well.  Figure 1 offers an example of how the Fed's efforts, or lack thereof, to fight inflation can impact capital gains tax rates.  Listed are the real capital gains tax rates from 1977 through 1993 on three-year investments yielding a total nominal return of 30 percent.  It is assumed that the investment is closed out at the end of the stated year, for example, the 1985 real capital gains tax rate relates to an investment made at the beginning of 1983 and sold at the end of 1985.<p>

A 28 percent capital gains tax rate acts as a considerable disincentive to investment, while real rates ranging from 40 percent to 494 percent to even paying taxes on a real capital loss, amount to economic suicide.  Indexation would eliminate inflation as a factor in capital gains determination -- equalizing stated and real capital gains tax rates.  The lower real rate would reduce uncertainty, and generate investment, economic growth, and job creation.<p>

<h3>From Cutting to Eliminating the Capital Gains Tax</h3>

	Members of the new Congress are considering a reduction in the capital gains tax rate from 28 percent to 19.8 percent by providing for a 50-percent exclusion on capital gains income.   Combined with indexation, reducing the top capital gains tax rate to 19.8 percent could be the most pro-growth step taken by the new Congress.<p>

	However, given the critical and high-risk nature of investment and entrepreneurship, and  the importance of maintaining a competitive environment in a global economy, capital gains should be excluded from taxation altogether.  A zero percent capital gains tax rate would ensure that entrepreneurial risk taking, so crucial to economic growth, would not be impeded by the U.S. federal tax code.<p>

	Figure 2 offers a comparison of capital gains tax rates among various nations.  The current U.S. non-indexed capital gains tax rate is not competitive internationally.  Even the two nations -- Australia and the United Kingdom -- with higher nominal rates than the United States allow for capital gains to be indexed for inflation.  Hence, the U.S. real capital gains tax rate often will exceed the rate in Australia and the U.K., depending on U.S. inflation.<p>

	From a capital gains perspective, these other nations offer a more conducive and dynamic environment for investment and entrepreneurship.  In a competitive, global economy, a zero percent capital gains tax rate would make the United States a magnet for capital.  Eliminating the capital gains tax would be the most pro-growth, proactive jobs program taken by the new Congress.<p>

<h3>The Growth Effects</h3>

	The potential benefits of eliminating the capital gains tax are clear.  Figure 3, for example, notes that venture capital investment was on the rise as the U.S. capital gains tax rate declined up to 1986; followed by a dramatic downturn as the rate was hiked 40 percent in 1987, from 20 percent to 28 percent.  Eliminating the capital gains tax would  augment incentives to invest in new and expanding ventures.<p>

	In a report released earlier this year,<a href="#foot3">3</a> and reported on in the Small Business Survival Committee's July 1994 <i>Small Business and the Economy</i> newsletter, economists Gary and Aldona Robbins estimated the economic impact of eliminating the federal capital gains tax.  By the year 2000, the Robbins' projected that a zero percent capital gains tax rate would lead to: <p>

<ul>
<li>an additional $3.2 trillion in capital formation;
<li>the creation of 1.1 million additional jobs;
<li>an extra $1.6 trillion in GDP between 1994 and 2000, with annual GDP $391 billion higher than otherwise by the year 2000;
<li>an additional 0.43 percentage points on the long-term annual growth rate for the economy.
</ul><p>

<h3>Government Revenues</h3>

	Gary and Aldona Robbins also noted that much of the lost revenue to the federal government would be recaptured due to enhanced economic growth resulting from the elimination of the capital gains tax.  In fact, when accounting for higher state and local revenues due to a higher rate of growth, they estimate that all levels of government would <i>net</i> $25 billion annually by the year 2000.<p>

	The Robbins' "dynamic" assumptions regarding the recapturing of revenues due to enhanced economic growth are much more realistic than the "static" models normally employed by critics of capital gains tax reduction.  After all, the economy is dynamic -- in the sense that individuals respond to incentives.  People are not static economic variables.<p>

	However, even if one is forced to employ unrealistic, static assumptions regarding revenue projections, the case for eliminating the capital gains tax still stands.  The purpose for eliminating capital gains taxes is to spur investment, entrepreneurship, and economic growth and opportunity.  If that means cutting government spending more deeply than might be called for under a more realistic, dynamic assessment of revenues, so be it.<p>

<h3>Who Benefits?</h3>

	Opponents will employ class warfare tactics, and argue that a capital gains tax is merely a sop to the wealthy.  However, capital gains taxes are not levies on the wealthy, but levies on wealth creation.  As argued here, the benefits of eliminating capital gains levies will be felt throughout the economy as economic growth accelerates.  Simply speaking, you can't have job creation without capital investment and entrepreneurs.<p>

	In addition, capital gains tend to be spread across a wider income spectrum than many believe.  As noted in Figure 4, based on 1992 federal income tax returns (most recent available), 56 percent of returns claiming capital gains were from incomes of $50,000 or less, including the capital gain.  As Figure 5 shows, total incomes of less than $100,000, including capital gains, claimed 83 percent of returns with capital gains.<a href="#foot4">4</a><p>

<h3>Wages and Interest vs. Capital Gains</h3>

	In addition to their false assumptions about large revenue losses and the identification of capital gains just with the wealthy, opponents of cutting or eliminating capital gains taxes often argue that no reason exists for differing tax treatments between capital gains and, for example, wage or interest income.<p>

	In fact, there is a distinct difference between wage or even interest income and capital gains -- risk.  Capital gains come from growth and appreciation of investments, which tend to carry greater risks than those associated with earning wages or even interest.  In particular, investments in small, entrepreneurial ventures carry significant risk.  As already noted, high-risk ventures must at least present the opportunity for high rewards.<p>

<h3>Small Business and the Economy Will Benefit From a 0% Capital Gains Tax Rate</h3>

	Small business is the engine of economic growth and job creation.  In order to undertake and/or expand a small business, one needs capital.  Without adequate capital, new ideas and businesses either never make it to the marketplace or they die a premature death.  And with such deaths also go products, services, and jobs.  By eliminating the capital gains tax, Congress and the Administration would greatly strengthen incentives for investment and entrepreneurship -- boosting economic growth and opportunity.<p>

	History shows that class warfare does not make for good economic policy.  In fact, during the 1980s, while tax rates declined, upper-income individuals paid a greater share of total income taxes, as the benefits of tax shelters declined and the rewards for working, saving and investment rose.  In this environment, from 1980 to 1989, 18 million jobs were created, and the employment ratio<a href="#head5">5</a> reached a record-high 63 percent in 1989.<p>

	The 1986 Tax Reform Act made positive strides by reducing personal and corporate tax rates, but went awry by trying to "pay" for these reductions with an increase in the capital gains tax rate.  Indeed, the economy paid a price for this capital gains tax hike in the form reduced venture capital investment and restrained entrepreneurship.<p>

	The time has come to unleash entrepreneurial capitalism by eliminating the capital gains tax.<p>

Founded in 1973, <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a> is a research and 
educational institute -- a think tank -- whose mission is to formulate and promote 
conservative public policies based on the principles of free enterprise, limited 
government, individual freedom, traditional American values, and a strong national 
defense.
<p>
Heritage's staff pursues this mission by performing timely, accurate research addressing 
key policy issues and effectively marketing these findings to our primary audiences: 
members of Congress, key congressional staff members, policymakers in the executive 
branch, the nation's news media, and the academic and policy communities.  Heritage's 
products include publications, articles, lectures, conferences, and meetings.
<p>
Governed by an independent Board of Trustees, The Heritage Foundation is a non-
partisan, tax-exempt institution.  Heritage relies on the private financial support of the 
general public -- individuals, foundations, and corporations -- for its income, and accepts 
no government funds and performs no contract work.  Heritage is one of the nations 
largest public policy research organizations.  More than 200,000 contributors make it the 
most broadly supported think tank in America.

<p>
	The <a href="dppo-toc.html"><i>Directory of Public Policy Organizations</i></a> is a publication of The Heritage Foundation's <a 
href="/heritage/dept_writeups/rban.htm">Resource Bank</a>. This first 
edition lists public policy organizations that may generally be said to 
share the broadly "conservative" or "classical liberal" point of view. It is 
our hope that this directory will be helpful to the news media, 
government officials, policy groups, academic institutions, and the public 
in locating organizations on the full range of public policy issues.
<p>
	Building the conservative movement is the main function of the 
nineteen-year-old Resource Bank. Part of Heritage's <a 
href="/heritage/dept_writeups/extrel.html">External Relations 
Department</a>, the Resource Bank is a communications link and 
information clearinghouse for some 400 conservative policy groups and 
2,000 conservative experts and scholars around the world. 
<p>
	Its main activities include publishing the monthly <a 
href="rtoc.html#insid"><i>Insider</i></a> newsletter and biennial 
Guide to Public Policy Experts; hosting several regular policy working 
groups; building directories of policy organizations, experts, and 
activists; organizing conferences and meetings of conservative scholars 
and policy group directors; and handling referrals concerning 
conservative groups and experts. 
<p>
	Placing special emphasis on the growing network of grassroots 
and state policy organizations, The Heritage Foundation's Resource 
Bank advances the conservative cause by highlighting the work of other 
conservative groups, promoting strong intra-movement communications, 
and organizing timely leadership strategy forums.

<title>Legislative Hotline</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/hotline/hotline.gif"></center>

<p>

<center><h2>Hotline for Week of November 22-29</h2></center>

<p>

Welcome to the FRC information line.  This message is being 
updated on Friday November 22 and will continue to be updated 
periodically until the 105th Congress reconvenes in January.

<p>

Gary L. Bauer, President of Family Research Council, delivered 
a message this past week challenging the Republican Party today 
to find its voice on values and to redirect its economic policy 
toward working class and middle class families.  On Wednesday, 
November 20th, in front of an audience at the Heritage 
Foundation, Bauer warned that "the great danger facing America 
is not from barbarians at the gates, but the sickness of our 
own hearts."  He continued,  "What is at stake is whether this 
great experiment in ordered liberty under God can survive.  
That was the great issue that should have been central to the 
presidential election . . . The warning signs of the failure of 
the 1996 campaign were these from the beginning.  The 
Republican unelected party leadership was obsessed for the last 
four years with the mantra of 'big tent.'  A big tent for what?  
To  what end?  To change America how?  To improve the prospects 
for our families and children in what way?  We can mock Bill 
Clinton's bridge to the 21st century, but it at least signals 
ideas.  Big tent signals that when it comes to ideas we don't 
care enough to make a case for what we believe."

<p>

Bauer went on to reveal that "The key fact of the American 
economy is this:  It is getting harder, not easier, for working 
families to make ends meet.  Yet the elite of the Republican 
party often seem not to recognize the problem.  It isn't just a 
problem of slow economic growth.  The real problem is that the 
take-home pay of workers has fallen behind the growth of the 
economy.  They get to keep less and less of what they earn . . . 
We have created 10 million-plus new jobs, but only eight 
million more workers are now employed.  Every three workers are 
holding down four jobs."

<p>

"There is much to be done, from pro-family tax reform to placing 
entitlements on a sound footing," Bauer offered, "But, the goals 
of these efforts can be summarized in a single phrase:  we must 
be, we will be, for working families.  We must support families 
that 'work' in that they are able to support themselves with the 
fruits of their labor . . . For way too long now both political 
parties have been guided by political consultants, pollsters and 
focus group gurus who substitute media manipulation for a 
governing philosophy.  We need to look no further for the 
growing cynicism of the American people . . . You don't need 
[political consultants and pollsters] to tell you what you 
believe.  Appeal to the better angels of the American people 
and trust them to respond as they always have when they hear 
the truth."

<p>

Family Research Council will continue to fight for the truth 
for the American people.  And as the 105th Congress prepares to 
convene in January, FRC will continue to develop public policy 
initiatives and recommendations that seek to restore the 
vitality of American families in this great nation.  

<p>

Thank you for calling the FRC Legislative Hotline.  And from 
all of us in FRC's Government Relations, we wish you and your 
family a Happy Thanksgiving.

A drill sergeant's brilliant assault on juvenile crime</h2>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<STRONG>Over the last five years, 775 young criminals -- some convicted of drug-dealing, robbery, and assault -- have taken Sergeant Roger Redd's crash course in law and order. All but a handful have stayed out of trouble. Here's how a former drill sergeant uses physical and moral discipline to shake men loose from a life of crime.
</STRONG>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	It's early morning in Fayetteville, North Carolina, home to the army's 82nd Airborne Division. Thirty pairs of feet shuffle clumsily to the cadence of a husky-voiced sergeant. Perhaps it's a little too early for some of these recruits, who are having trouble following orders. "Don't show me a grin, I'm not a dentist," snaps Sergeant Roger Redd. "Don't anticipate the command. Pay attention. Engage the brain, engage the brain."

<br>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Although the rows of young men with closely cropped hair may resemble greenhorn troops from nearby Fort Bragg, the scene is deceptive. The men are not recruits -- they're criminals. And this isn't boot camp, it's the parking lot of the Cumberland County courthouse.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"You say you got in trouble, you can't do anything with your life," Redd says. "Wrong answer. You decided to break the law. You made a mistake, but now you're going to profit from it. You're going to do right."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Welcome to Sergeant Redd's physical-training program, a court-approved plan to turn troublemakers on probation into law-abiding citizens. Redd, a court bailiff and former army drill sergeant, oversees a military-style regimen three mornings a week that mixes physical discipline, mental toughness, and common-sense counseling. Less than a chain gang but more than a Jane Fonda workout, Redd's 90-day program is being hailed locally as one of the most successful efforts anywhere to take youthful offenders otherwise bound for prison and turn their lives around. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In a few hours, Redd will be busy at his paying job: handcuffing suspects, breaking up fights, and escorting criminals to court or to jail. But now, at just after 5 a.m., he's volunteering to steer these youngsters away from a lawless future by giving them some private lessons on crime and punishment. One at a time, they stand up and explain how they got into trouble with the law.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"I was charged with auto theft," one mumbles.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"You were stealing cars," says Redd, pacing slowly.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"I wasn't stealin' cars. I was stealin' car parts."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"What were you gonna' do," Redd fires back, "put a car together?"
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"No."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"Get down and push. It's 'no, <i>sir</i>!' "
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The boy drops to the ground and starts doing push-ups while others stand and recite their stories. No one else forgets to say "sir."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But Redd isn't through with them yet. "If you're used to using your conscience every day, then you're not going to go out and do something stupid," he says. "By the time you leave here, you should be remorseful for what you've done." His aim: teach personal responsibility and break the men of their "I'm a victim" mentality. Until that happens, Redd says, he won't be able to shake them loose from criminal behaviors and keep them out of prison.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Make no mistake: Prison is exactly where most of the men, ages 16 to 21, are headed. "Most come to this program because they failed every other method to keep them out of the Department of Corrections," says court administrator Kim Tucker. "This is the last stop."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	All are on probation for committing a nonviolent offense, such as breaking and entering, larceny, or drug possession. Many are repeat offenders, whose crimes as juveniles -- which are expunged from public record -- include arson, robbery, and even assault with a deadly weapon. Virtually all of them have violated the conditions of their probation, and are one step away from prison. "Most of them have never been taught discipline or respect," says Redd. "They're used to doing what they want to, on their own, when they get good and ready. And suddenly now someone's in charge telling them what to do and how not to do it. It's a shock to them."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This may be just the kind of shock therapy needed to jolt young lawbreakers to their senses. About 775 of the 875 men and women who've entered the program have gone on to complete it. According to the county court, only 15 of the graduates have been charged with subsequent criminal offenses. Redd, who keeps a file of each of his graduates, says that 65 have joined the army, and many have completed high school and gotten jobs. "I'm in a position to see a lot of young men come through here," says assistant district attorney Charles Scott, who regularly refers men to the program. "We've seen a very small number come back." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Criminal-justice officials say they know of no other alternatives to prison -- not boot camps, not home surveillance, not work programs -- that approach the program's success rates. "It's the best alternative sentencing program that I'm aware of in the state of North Carolina, and maybe nationally, in terms of results achieved," says E. Lynn Johnson, a superior-court judge who helped Redd launch the effort more than five years ago. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Redd got the idea after helplessly watching teens and young adults stream in and out of court -- men who, in Redd's view, needed a muscular dose of physical and moral discipline. But they weren't likely to get that from the state's probation system or from imprisonment. "Think about it. In prison you get free education, exercise, television," says Art Zeidman, a candidate for superior-court judge who has run alternatives-to-prison programs in Raleigh. "For the first-time offender, the system is one of a comfortable cocoon, and they don't feel a need to stay away from it." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Patricia Timmons Goodson, a district-court judge in Cumberland County, says she was "not satisfied at all" with her sentencing options. Supervised probation, a commonly used alternative to prison, often fails because a mere handful of county probation officers are asked to track nearly 1,900 youthful offenders now in the system. "You would continue to see many -- too many -- of the same young people coming back," she says.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Redd was convinced his army experience offered a solution. Participants in his program enter a structured training environment a few hours a day, three days a week, for three months. They must arrive on time, wear uniforms, and learn basic drills. They also receive regular warnings to stay in school, along with practical instruction about finding and keeping jobs.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Add to this Redd's blend of personal and professional grit: He grew up poor in a family of eight children; signed up for three tours in Vietnam as an infantry combat soldier; piloted an attack helicopter that was gunned down over Hamburger Hill; received five Purple Hearts for being wounded five times; spent six months in a hospital bed with a foot wound while doctors fretted that he would never walk again; and retired, a first sergeant with the 82nd Airborne, after 22 years in the military.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Redd's approach offers both a carrot and a stick. Graduates avoid jail and might also see the court relax their probation requirements. Nongraduates head straight to jail. Redd decides who is fit to graduate -- with no second chances and no appeals.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	An early believer, Judge Johnson first began referring men to the program in February 1991. Today, virtually every judge, district attorney, and probation officer in the county's court system scouts out offenders who might be good candidates. Court officers such as Goodson regularly don sneakers and sweats and join Redd in the morning to speak to his latest crop of students. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The key to Redd's strategy is using the best of his military training to reinforce good habits and, eventually, good attitudes. That includes regular drills, countless push-ups, five-mile runs, and swift consequences for disobeying commands. For these men, many of whom have dropped out of high school and haven't held a job, getting up and getting to the courthouse on time is a milestone in personal discipline.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Everyone gets a chance to act as a squad leader, yelling out drill commands. The reason: Many kids who get into trouble do so because they are followers, easily drawn into crime when they're idle. "The man is totally in control of his actions. He doesn't drink, he doesn't smoke, but he still has a great time," says Wesley, one of Redd's graduates who returns a few mornings a month to help train others in the program. "He's teaching them to act independently, not to go along with the crowd."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The approach differs from many boot-camp experiments, however, because it offers much more than a physical regimen. Says Johnson: "It goes beyond just physically getting in their faces and teaching them how many push-ups they can do, but teaching them to be a man or a woman along the way."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	How does the sergeant teach young men about manhood? In Redd's equation, it's the little decisions that matter, the choices that eventually add up to excellence and integrity. So when he sees his troops marching out of formation, he pounces. "That's raggedy," he barks. "I said a straight row. That's like being on your job and they want you to make sure the pots and pans are put away and they're clean. You do it and you do it <i>right</i>. Men have <i>discipline</i>."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Redd also counsels the men, individually and in groups. They never seem to know when he'll launch into a mini-sermon about responsibility, honesty, or conscience. Sometimes Redd will focus on building their self-respect: "Every one of you sitting here, from left to right, is just as good as I am. But now you've got a temporary setback," he says. "What you have to do is keep yourself straight and work hard." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	During his speech, Redd spots a late arrival who tries to slip into formation. He doesn't miss a beat: "Get down and <i>push!</i> If you're late tomorrow, just keep on running, right to jail. Because you're going to jail, because you can't follow instructions. You have an obligation and responsibility to yourself to get here on time."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	At other times, he presses home the obligation to show respect for others. One of his favorite phrases: "People have the right to be left alone." Redd asks the men to picture themselves as adult parents (some of them are), and to imagine one of their children dying of a cocaine overdose, or a stab wound, or from gun fire. "I want them to realize they would not want this to happen to their child," he says later. "So I place them in a predicament. It makes them wake up and think. Now we're engaging the brain."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	After less than a week in the program, Mike's brain already is engaged. He was convicted of burglary and assault with a weapon. Now, during a short break between drills, he says he's determined to graduate so he can clear his record. He's studying computer programming at Fayetteville Technical Training College. "I'm trying to think about the future," he says. Wesley, the recent grad who volunteers as a squad leader, was arrested on drug charges but now works as a graphic artist. "It gave me a real hope that I could still make something of myself," he says, "regardless of the past." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Redd usually works with about 50 men at a time (plus an occasional woman or two), and nearly 90 percent of them graduate. They might be rewarded with termination of their probation, fewer hours of community service, or reduced fines. Court officials hold a graduation ceremony for each class, and distribute diplomas and special awards donated by community groups, including a tuition scholarship to a local community college. The graduates, all wearing white shirts and black ties, often will pause to thank Redd for being tough on them and convincing them they could make it.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"You can see the care in him," says Kathy Bond, the county's chief probation officer. "You see that hard-nosed soldier, but then you see that other side of him, too -- that compassionate person that really wants to help somebody." That's a combination most of these men have rarely glimpsed before. Many grew up with no father in the home. Some live with cousins or grandmothers or on the streets. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	They're usually surprised when Redd offers to take them to church, or out to breakfast, or to help arrange a job interview, or negotiate their sentence with the district attorney. Near the end of one session, Redd has the men stand and explain what they've gotten out of the program so far. Says one boy, "For once the system is not working against me, but working for me."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Straight talk about responsibility and respect, physical discipline that reinforces basic life skills, and a caring but hard-as-nails authority figure -- could that be a formula for breaking the cycle of juvenile crime?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"I think it can be duplicated," says Judge Goodson, "but it's going to take a person that is just as tough . . . and just as committed as Roger Redd." Cumberland County doesn't spend a dime on the program: Redd takes no money for directing the effort, works during his off-hours, uses no county facilities, and asks the local Chamber of Commerce to donate uniforms as needed. By keeping hundreds of offenders out of jail, he calculates, he saves the county $41 a day, or about $6.5 million over the last five years.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Says Judge Johnson: "Roger's experiment here could be contagious." The Bureau of Justice Statistics reports that at least 520,000 of the nation's juveniles are placed on probation each year. With numbers like that, we should hope for an epidemic.<p><i><b>Joe Loconte</b> is the deputy editor of</i> Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship.

<h2>Bellwethers of Realignment</h2>
<b>By Bernadette Malone</b>
</center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Will the surprise election of a Republican majority in the 104th Congress prove to be the first cannonball fired in a full-scale conservative revolution in the federal government, or merely a brief surgical strike to redirect an overreaching president's imprudent agenda? That question, of course, will be determined by the historians.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Regardless of the outcome of the congressional races this November, state legislatures around the country are providing an irrefutable case for an emerging nationwide trend toward a conservative governing philosophy of traditional values, free-market solutions, and smaller government.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Eighteen state legislative chambers have switched from Democratic to Republican control since the 1994 election -- either by direct election or their legislators' party-switching. (One of these, the Wisconsin senate, reverted back to Democratic rule, but only after a Republican senator was recalled by voters for his support of a tax increase.)<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	On the national level, conservatism and its standard bearers in Congress haven't had an easy year. Many voters who were enamored of the ideas of Republican candidates in November 1994 are expressing doubt to pollsters that the person they voted for should remain in office in 1997.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But the important thing to remember is that the left's attack on the 104th Congress has focused on the messenger of conservative government -- House Speaker Newt Gingrich -- and not the message. To their apparent advantage in polls, challengers to conservative members of congress lambaste their opponents' allegiance to the vilified and unpopular Speaker.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This tactic won't work in state legislative races, where most conservative candidates have never met Gingrich, much less voted with him. State office-seekers are able to separate themselves from the government shutdowns and default threats that haunt many of their federal counterparts and concentrate on the local issues that characterize the devolution of Big Government.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Here are the key states to watch on November 5th for evidence of the conservative agenda's progress:<p>	<center><b>Florida</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Jeb Bush doesn't think it's necessarily the big changes in this state that highlight Florida's growing conservatism. "It's just a continued, constant march towards changing the relationship of government to the people," explains Bush, who came within 2 percentage points of defeating Lawton Chiles for the governorship in 1994. This past legislative session marks the first time since Reconstruction that Florida's senate is Republican-controlled. And come November, the house will go the way of the senate if the GOP can capture three seats. They are very optimistic: 11 of the 12 representatives retiring this year are Democrats, and most are from districts that Bush, the son of President George Bush, carried over Chiles in his narrow loss.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The mainstay of the Democrats' re-election strategy is their no-new-taxes votes and a record of holding growth in the state budget to only 2 percent this session, reports Susan McManus, a professor of public administration and political science at the University of South Florida. "Florida, like the nation at large, has become more conservative over the years," McManus wrote in a recent paper.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"There's no question Florida is shifting to the right, both philosophically and in terms of party registration," says John Smith, the vice president of the James Madison Institute, in Tallahassee. He cites as examples Florida's stringent welfare bill, which is currently awaiting approval from the federal government; tough crime measures; and a new charter-school system. If Republicans take the senate, a school-voucher bill that died during this session has an excellent chance of passage.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Most indicative of the conservatism blossoming in Florida is the slowing of the state spending machine. Since 1983, Smith says, state spending increases averaged $2.4 billion a year. But spending increases in the two most recent budgets have averaged just $500 million. According to Smith, the 1994 state and federal elections and the spending-cap amendment Floridians voted for (also in 1994) are responsible for this encouraging trend.<p><center><b>Iowa</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The 1994 electoral tidal wave washed over Iowa's lower chamber, enlarging the Republicans' 51-49 majority to 63-37, but it left the senate in Democratic control by a margin of 27-24. Will the November election be a victory for conservatives in the senate?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
"It will give them a Republican majority -- but not a conservative influence. That will probably take another election cycle," admits Secretary of State Paul Pate, a Republican and a rising prospect for the governorship. (Governor Terry Branstad is not seeking re-election in 1998.) As a member of the senate from 1989 until 1994, Pate struggled to shepherd conservative bills through his own Republican caucus. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But Pate is confident that some of the Republican candidates running to replace retiring Democrats are solid conservatives who will advance the ball next session. The death penalty, parental notification for minors seeking abortions, and regulatory relief are some major issues Iowa conservatives have been pushing, and all have been obstructed by the Democratic senate.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"The senate was the roadblock to getting any tax cuts at all," says Robert Solt, the research director of Iowans for Tax Relief, of the past legislative session. Under GOP rule, the House introduced an income-tax reduction bill that was supported by Branstad, but thwarted by the more liberal senate. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Eventually the senate compromised and passed a property-tax relief bill. Pointing to this year's state budget surplus of $200 million (compared to 1992's $400 million debt), Solt sees ample opportunity for tax cuts next session if Republicans capture the senate. And Pate cites capital gains and inheritance-tax relief as top priorities of the next legislative session, provided Republicans pick up two senate seats and majority control.<p><center><b>Maine</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Bethel Furniture Stock, located near Maine's border with New Hampshire, makes wood parts for furniture. Leon Favreau is the firm's president and part owner. Although he doesn't consider himself a conservative, he remarks that the country, and especially Maine, have grown more conservative over recent years. His biggest concern of late is a referendum put on the state ballot by environmentalists that would outlaw the harvesting of trees throughout most of the state. "It has the possibility of forcing our operation to close overnight," he says.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In a state supposedly growing more conservative, how does this threat to the economy gain so much steam? Freshman state representative Lisa Lumbra, a Maine native, explains that residents of the state tend to mind their own business, so the governing is usually left to liberal activists. But a bill passed by the state legislature in 1993 granting special rights to homosexuals served as a wakeup call. A recount after the 1994 election turned control of the senate over to the GOP, and left Republicans in the house one seat shy of a majority.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Lumbra is worried that the senate will not be able to retain its control with the retirement of two conservative stalwarts, but the chances of her party becoming the majority in the house are high. Even as the minority party, house Republicans were able to stop funding for a Goals 2000 bill, pass a 15 percent tax cut pending a budget surplus, and stop a $12 million state health program that covered family planning but not hospitalization costs.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But even if Republicans lose the senate, "the conservative trend will be obvious," Lumbra predicts. There are a few conservative Democrats who will be instrumental in passing a tax cut independent of a budget surplus, deregulating the tree-harvesting industry, and scaling down the state's intrusive Department of Human Services, which Lumbra cites as her constituents' top complaint. Leon Favreau might not consider himself a conservative, but he is voting Republican this year.<p><center><b>Nevada</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Serious welfare reform, mirroring Wisconsin governor Tommy Thompson's plan, was stalled in the assembly this year after votes on the bill were cast entirely along party lines. It tied 21-21. In its place, the assembly passed a welfare bill authorizing more money for employment programs and counseling.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Republicans and Democrats have shared the chairmanship over the assembly chamber, which was brought to parity in the 1994 election. All but one of the six representatives retiring this year are Democrats, however, and Republican registration in the state exceeded 50 percent this year for the first time. If all goes as planned, it's round two in Nevada for real welfare reform. Republicans will retain their majority in the senate.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Even if Republicans are unable to take the chamber, "there may be enough external pressure from the president's signature on the federal welfare bill for Democrats to support statewide reform," says Judy Cresanta, the president of the Nevada Policy Research Institute.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Cresanta also thinks that a Republican assembly would take a crack at nepotism in the teachers union and pass property-rights legislation, a winner with voters in a state where 80 percent of the land is owned by the federal government.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	And there's good news for Nevadans on the economic front, too. Carol Vilardo, the president of the Nevada Taxpayers' Association, says, "This is the first year we didn't have to go in [to the legislative session] looking to raise taxes." That's because in the 1991 session, the legislature put an end to automatic spending increases for the coming year based on last year's revenues. This is the first year the new policy's effects were felt.<p><center><b>North Carolina</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The booming Research Triangle and Charlotte metropolitan areas have attracted many urban Yankees over the past decade, which would lead one to assume that the land of Jesse Helms has taken on a liberal tinge. But judging from the size of the gains Republicans made in the general assembly and state senate in 1994 (when they took over the assembly and wound up two seats shy of a majority in the senate), one is prompted to reconsider.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Grassroots Research, a Charlotte-based public opinion company, recently conducted a poll of 500 registered North Carolina voters and found that 81 percent disapprove of the race-based admissions standards at the University of North Carolina, 76 percent favor a constitutional amendment for congressional term limits, and 74 percent believe that someone who earns twice as much as they do should pay no more than twice as much in taxes. This same sample of voters splits its support between Democratic challenger Harvey Gantt and Republican incumbent Jesse Helms in this year's U.S. Senate race. That indicates that, while North Carolinians have doubts about a person associated with conservative ideas this November, they cling faithfully to a conservative agenda.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"The trend in North Carolina to be more fiscally conservative and certainly more conservative all around has extended to the Republican Party," observes senate Minority Leader Betsy Cochran. She foresees her party capturing a slim majority in the senate this fall. If so, a pilot program for school vouchers has an good chance of passage, tough welfare reform will be introduced, and quite possibly, affirmative action will be addressed in a "methodical, deliberative manner," she says. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	These plans depend on Republicans retaining their majority in the Assembly, and at this point "it's very difficult to predict with any accuracy what's going to happen," says John Hood, the president of the John Locke Foundation, a think tank in Raleigh. Hood wonders whether Republicans can effectively make the case for their election to the public, given the popularity that Democratic governor Jim Hunt has won by cutting taxes after the 1994 elections jolted the legislature. If they really want to distinguish themselves from Democrats, Hood says, they need to go after affirmative action. They just might.<p><center><b>Washington</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"I know every state claims to be the most liberal in the nation, but we've proved it over the years," laughs Bill Baldwin, the president of the Washington Institute for Policy Studies. But with the prospect of property-tax reduction and regulatory and welfare reform sailing through the legislature next session, Washington is looking a lot different these days.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	When asked about his state's facelift, Senator Dan McDonald, the majority leader, suggests it's "probably because the last million to million and  a half people who have moved to Washington state are more conservative than the people who were their predecessors." He cites an increase in the number of suburban voters and social conservatives in his state as reasons for this trend.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In 1994, when Republicans picked up 25 house seats (a phenomenon widely attributed to the popularity of the term-limits movement), it was their biggest proportional legislative gain in the country. They control the house 62-36, and are only one seat away for a majority in the senate. Baldwin is optimistic that the policies his think tank endorses will be enacted next year, because twice as many Democrats as Republicans are retiring from the senate this year.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Washingtonians will also elect a governor this year, and if it's a Republican, says Baldwin, there is a good chance that the GOP will be able to repeal the state labor law and start privatizing some of its services. What would another Democratic governor do to Baldwin's agenda? "We'll just put referendum clauses on a lot of these things, bypass the governor, and bring these issues straight to the people," says McDonald.<p><center><b>Wisconsin</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The 1994 gains made by the GOP suffered a setback when Republican state senator George Petak was recalled for breaking his promise and voting for a tax increase to fund a sports stadium. The GOP lost its fragile one-seat majority, and now the GOP must protect the assembly and take back the senate. Before Petak's recall, this legislative session's reform-minded agenda had attracted national attention. Governor Tommy Thompson's rise to the vice presidential short-list was due almost entirely to the welfare reform bill passed by the legislature. "Welfare reform never would have come up for a vote under a Democratically controlled legislature . . . but the final vote was overwhelmingly supportive," says Mary Jo Pauke of the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Another issue that never would have been addressed is abortion, but under the Republican leadership parental-consent and waiting-period laws were passed into law. Pretty ambitious for one term, but conservatives aren't content to rest on their laurels.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"For the first time in Wisconsin, people are actually going to see their tax bill go down," notes Steve Baas, the communications director for Assembly Majority Leader Scott Jensen. Republicans are campaigning on a $1-billion tax-relief package as next session's legislative centerpiece that would protect the property-tax cut passed this year, eliminate the marriage penalty in the Wisconsin tax code, give working families a tax credit, implement a supermajority rule for tax increases, and provide a 100 percent capital-gains exemption for family farms and business.

<h2>Shalom for At-Risk Youth</h2>
<b>By Heidi Goldsmith</b>
</center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Americans across the political spectrum are talking about the value of boarding schools for poor children from broken families and violent neighborhoods. They say we need more residential schools like Piney Woods Country Life School in Mississippi, Boys Town in Nebraska, and the Milton Hershey School, Girard College, and Scotland School for Veterans' Children in Pennsylvania. Despite their troubled families and neighborhoods, the vast majority of students from these schools graduate and go on to college, the military, or jobs.  <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The major barriers to opening new residential schools are high costs and scarce funds. Annual per-student costs range from around $22,000 at Piney Woods, Girard, and the Job Corps, to $45,000 at others. The creators of a few residential charter schools on the drawing board anticipate annual costs of approximately $26,000 per student. <p>

 <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Israel's network of 70 children and youth villages offers a model for successful and modestly priced residential schools. Residential education is more widely available in Israel than anywhere else: About 7 percent of Israeli youth attend these schools, at a cost of $6,500 to $9,000 per year. Israel's system comprises child-centered communities for "normal" children who have troubled home environments. The message to the students is, "What your family cannot provide you, the community will." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Based on a hybrid of the European boarding schools and the "kibbutz" (communal settlement), Israel's residential education system began in 1933, when thousands of Jewish children were rescued from the Holocaust in Europe and brought to what would become the State of Israel. Special residential schools were created to care for these young, traumatized refugees. Since then, these schools have adapted to the changing demographics and needs of young Israelis who, for various reasons, lack sufficient support from their families. Many of Israel's top politicians (including Shimon Peres), artists, military heroes, and business executives are graduates of these schools. Roughly half the students today are neglected or abused Israelis born in Israel. The other half are new immigrants, mainly from the former Soviet Union and Ethiopia. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Costs are lower in Israel than in America in part because staff salaries are approximately one-third of comparable U.S. salaries. But Israeli youth villages are less expensive also because they are burdened by fewer regulations than American schools. The typical residential student-to-staff ratio in Israel is 10:1; the ideal is 6:1. The norm for residential care in the United States is 4:1, though in some states and programs it is 1:1. Israeli youth villages tend not to have psychological counselors or social workers on staff, as is often required by state regulations in this country. They do not have to provide two adults during the night for every 12 youths, as required by many states. Nor must they hire registered nurses or residential supervisors with Licensed Social Worker degrees (LICSWs), unlike American facilities that wish to qualify for funding from programs such as Medicaid. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"We use psychology, not psychologists; child development theory, not social workers," says Zvi Levy, the director of WIZO-Hadassim Youth Village, near Netanya, Israel. He focuses on developing a child's abilities, not offering therapy for her problems. Instead of "experts" with degrees in counseling, Levy likes to hire positive role models -- adults, usually married, who have served in the military, who have finished high school and usually college, who naturally relate well to the students. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Levy's youth village has 45 residential staff for 500 students. "Too many staff means too much structure," he says. Students' input and assistance is therefore needed and encouraged. The village has two rules for both staff and students: Never hurt anyone, physically or emotionally, and attend school. Students otherwise have enormous freedom to plan their free time. Instead of devising programs specific to each student, the school sets goals and provides a simple, well-planned environment with strong community norms where students learn to navigate the setting at their own speed. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Fewer regulations does not mean less accountability. The real measure of whether these programs are effective comes years later: Are graduates employed, taxpaying citizens? Have they formed healthy relationships and created strong families? Using these measures, a 25-year study by the University of Haifa concluded the villages were very effective. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Israeli youth villages are largely funded by the equivalent of voucher programs. The Ministry of Education pays to a residential school what it would otherwise pay for a student's education elsewhere. The residential component is paid to the school by either the Ministry of Welfare or The Ministry of Immigration. Private funds supplement the public funds, adding 10 percent to 20 percent of the school budget. American residential schools could benefit from similar flexibility. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Residential schools offer enormous potential for addressing the problems of America's troubled youth. We could have more of them if we applied the community and child development approach, and enjoyed the same flexibility in regulation and funding of Israel's villages.

<h2>EPA Greenmails the States</h2>
<b>By Jessica Gavora</b>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Here's a statistic that would make Joe Six-Pack wince. The Coors brewery in Golden, Colorado, spills between 18 and 22 million gallons of beer every year as it overfills its cans and bottles to force the air out before they're sealed. That's a foamy runoff of about a six-pack a second. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	One man's brewsky, of course, is another man's "volatile organic compound." VOC -- that's how Colorado environmental officials classify the evaporating ethanol given off by all that spilled beer. VOCs can be harmful in large amounts, but until 1993 breweries like Coors were thought to be minor-league emitters of these naturally occurring toxins. <p>

</td></tr>
<tr><td valign=center>
<hr width=75></td>

</table>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But then Coors did something controversial, and increasingly popular among American companies: It tested itself. The company conducted a voluntary self-audit of its operations to see whether they complied with state environmental standards. It discovered that they didn't -- regulators had underestimated the brewery's VOC emissions by a factor of 17 -- and promptly reported its infraction to state environmental authorities.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As a reward for playing the good corporate citizen and turning itself in, Coors was slapped with a record $1-million fine by the Colorado Department of Health. The company protested the fine, arguing that a million bucks was too much to pay for alerting the state to pollution that neither party had known was occurring. The state legislature and Democratic governor Roy Romer agreed, and in 1994 Colorado became the second state in the nation to pass a law to protect the results of self-audits from being used against companies that voluntarily disclose and correct their environmental infractions.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	To date, 19 states have passed audit laws -- all of them since 1993 -- and 25 more are considering them. But this surging tide of state innovation is lapping up against a formidable seawall of entrenched federal bureaucratic interests. Officials at the <a href="http://www.epa.gov/">Environmental Protection Agency</a> (EPA) and the Justice Department have long been hostile to self-audit laws, and that hostility has recently turned to active sabotage. States that have passed these laws -- as well as those merely considering them -- are being bluntly told that they do so at the risk of losing autonomy over their own environmental programs. Do it our way, the EPA has warned, or don't do it at all. Democratic and Republican state officials recognize this tactic for what it is: blackmail. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In the age of reinvented government, rulemaking by the EPA has increased by 20 percent since 1992. Wayne Crews of the <a href="http://www.cei.org/">Competitive Enterprise Institute</a> estimates the cost of environmental regulation at $174 billion this year, a whopping 26 percent of the total regulatory burden on American families.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Self-audits help businesses cut through complex regulations administered by multiple layers of bureaucracy by providing them with a detailed breakdown of their operations, including suspected sources of pollution. As long as these reports remain in-house, they are useful tools that result in greater environmental compliance. But for bureaucrats used to measuring results in terms of the fines and sentences they impose, audit reports are an irresistible temptation to regulate.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In some instances, as with Coors, state or federal regulators subpoena the audit reports themselves. In others, third parties -- typically environmental groups -- use these reports as the basis for class-action lawsuits. As a result, many companies are understandably reluctant to perform a self-audit.States are attempting to overcome this reluctance by providing businesses with assurances that their good deeds will not be used against them. Most state laws protect, or "privilege," audit reports from use against the company in a lawsuit. Many also provide limited immunity from prosecution to companies that promptly report and correct any violations they uncover. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;States love self-auditing because it allows them to replace the old command-and-control regulatory model with one that allows private-sector innovation. Audits are part of a new thinking about regulation that prizes a cooperative private industry over a reactive regulatory bureaucracy, and environmental compliance over punishment. Whereas the old model relied on legions of enviro-cops to enforce the law, the new model does what even the most zealous and well-staffed bureaucracy cannot: detect operational problems before they become environmental hazards.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But for all the same reasons the states love self-auditing, it seems, the feds hate it. Although it cannot cite one case in which an audit-protection law was abused, the EPA has decided that states with audit laws are guilty until proven innocent. Without the benign supervision of our federal regulators, EPA officials tell state governors, you will willfully and intentionally foul your own nests. When New Hampshire was considering an audit law last year, John DeVillars, the chief EPA administrator for that region, warned Governor Steve Merrill that the law might tempt him to relax environmental enforcement and turn his state into a "pollution haven" in order to attract business. Merrill replied that he was offended by the suggestion that he would jeopardize the health of his citizens by ignoring criminal behavior -- and he signed the law.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	When artful persuasion failed to sway the states, federal bureaucrats resorted to a blunter instrument: their power to delegate to -- or withhold from -- the states the authority over environmental programs under the major federal laws. In March 1995, EPA Administrator Carol Browner warned that the passage of state audit laws "would cause environmental programs delegated to states . . . to revert to national control at EPA." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For the 50 states, this was no small matter. Although most major federal environmental statutes allow the states to administer and enforce programs, EPA officials have the ultimate say in when and how that authority is granted. They have not been shy about using it. States that are considering audit laws such as Ohio, Arizona, Florida, and California have received what one official dubbed "nastygrams" from the EPA. Earlier this year, for instance, Arizona was warned in the bluntest terms that passage of its audit law would lead to a denial of the state's authority to run the Clean Air Act permit program. Other states that have audit laws and would also like to be able to issue permits to businesses under the Clean Air Act -- including Texas, Idaho, and Michigan--have been denied that authority by the EPA. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In some states, this "delegation blackmail" approach seems to be working. Audit bills died in the Ohio, Maryland, and California legislatures this year following heavy lobbying by the EPA and environmental groups. Texas state senator Warren Chisum, who sponsored the Texas law as a Democrat but became a Republican this year, said "the EPA threats have certainly played a role in delaying this in other states. Legislators might say these bills are a good deal, but they are not worth bringing down the wrath of the EPA upon the state." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Still, some state officials refused to be cowed. "I think scare tactics in swing districts in an election year can be effective, but I didn't poll anyone," says Arizona state representative Russell Bowers. "It always disturbs me when state law is dictated to us by the feds. But the bill will be back next year."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For others, the Clinton administration's heavy-handed tactics have only increased their resolve. Russell Harding, the director of Michigan's Department of Environmental Quality, has been a leader in organizing states with audit laws to resist federal pressure. Harding has dug in his heels in Lansing every bit as deep as Carol Browner's pumps pierce the terra in Washington, D.C. -- maybe deeper. "We think we have a very balanced, very carefully crafted law," he says. "Our intention is not to change it. If push comes to shove, we'll give them their programs back."

<b>Funds for New Leadership</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 

	Since 1993, the William H. Donner Foundation, of New York, has granted "New Leadership" fellowships to recognize individuals or groups whose grass-roots efforts to better their communities exemplify the principles of the foundation's "human capital" program. These include self-reliance, entrepreneurialism, personal responsibility, and volunteerism.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	This year's winners of the fellowships include: the Reverend Ronald Matlack, of Camden, New Jersey, who established a church on the model of a foreign mission to relieve blight in an urban neighborhood; Carl Elkins, the founder of the Homeless Literacy Project, in New York City; James Robinson, who started a volunteer ambulance corps for youth in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of New York; Terrence Tighe, the founder of an "employability program" that teaches workplace skills and demeanor to K-8 students at an urban Omaha Catholic school; and David Green, the executive director of a network of education services known as the David School for poor families and at-risk youth in Eastern Kentucky. The awards usually amount to $60,000 over three years.

<p>
<b>Report Card on Devolution</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The Urban Institute and the Annie E. Casey Foundation have launched an ambitious $20-million project to evaluate the effects of devolution -- or the "New Federalism" -- on social services and communities. The multi-year project aims to answer three major questions about the federal government's efforts to devolve many responsibilities to states and municipalities: (1) How will the New Federalism affect state and local budgets? (2) How will it affect state policy priorities and the delivery of services? (3) How will it affect the behavior and well-being of individuals and families? Researchers at the Urban Institute will track the course of devolutionary policies from legislative bodies all the way down to neighborhoods, and analyze their effects according to a number of statistical indicators of social well-being. These indicators include "health status" (e.g. rates of low-birth-weight births and childhood immunization); "child and youth well-being" (child abuse and neglect, teen pregnancies, and teen deaths, for example); "family well-being" (the number of out-of-wedlock births and children in foster care, to name a few); and "economic security" (for example, poverty levels, number of families receiving public assistance, employment rates, and income growth).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 
	The project may not issue a comprehensive report for at least three years, but will release periodic policy briefs and interim reports.

<h2>What Works</h2>

<b>A Model Principal</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In the <i>New York Times Magazine</i>, Sara Mosle, a contributing writer, describes Brooklyn's Science Skills Center and its controversial principal, Michael Johnson. Science Skills, a high school whose students come from some of New York's most impoverished neighborhoods, was started by Johnson with the help of New Visions for Public Schools, a Manhattan-based organization that works with the Board of Education and the private sector to promote school reform. Johnson, a 45-year-old African American, graduated from Empire State College with a degree in science education. Like many educators involved in the effort to reform New York's public schools, he believes that poor children are being shortchanged by the system. Unlike most "progressive" educators, however, Johnson is convinced that the way to help poor minority students is not by loosening standards, but by tightening them.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	As a result, Science Skills Center is focused on preparing students to do well on standardized tests, including the New York State Regents exams and the Scholastic Aptitude Tests. At a time when only 20 percent of New York's public-school students receive a Regents diploma, all of Johnson's students -- even those designated as special-education students -- take, and pass, the Regents exam.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Not surprisingly, this has made Science Skills Center extremely popular with New York's parents, many of whose children have to be turned away simply because the school does not have enough space for all the applicants. But "progressive" educators are horrified by Johnson's emphasis on tests, his autocratic style, and his rigorous, back-to-basics curriculum. They think that schools should prepare students for the world as it already exists. "Parents at my school have some very fundamental questions," he observes. "Can my kid read? Can my kid add the grocery bill? Can my kid go to college? Some of my colleagues want to duck those questions and say, 'They're not important.' But we can't just say that we don't believe in measuring our kids against kids in other parts of the city or state, because colleges are making decisions based on those comparisons. . . . Harvard it still looking at scores, so that's what I'm going with."
<p>
<i>* "Scores Count" by Sara Mosle</i>, New York Times Magazine, <i>September 8, 1996</i>.
<p>
<b>A Classical Curriculum</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Gene Edward Veith, dean of arts and sciences at Concordia University, in Wisconsin, writes that too many  proposals to reform America's schools focus on means -- vouchers, technology, teacher certification -- rather than on ends. Although he does not disparage these means, what American education most urgently requires, Veith contends, is a new philosophy of education -- a return to the classical conception of education as the knowledge a person requires to be truly free, and to the classical "trivium" of grammar, logic, and rhetoric. "To be educated in any discipline," he writes, "one must know its basic facts (grammar); be able to think deeply about the subject (logic); and be able to act on that knowledge in a personal, original and independent way (rhetoric)."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Veith cites three examples of how the classical approach to education is being used in primary and secondary schools. The Association of Classical and Christian Schools (ACCS), which currently has 26 member schools, was founded in 1993 by the Reverend Douglas Wilson, a Protestant minister from Idaho, to promote the idea of a Christian education organized around the trivium. In the prototype ACCS school, the Logos School (founded by Wilson in 1980), the primary grades are devoted to acquiring basic knowledge -- reading, arithmetic, patriotic and biblical stories. Middle school and junior high are devoted to "the questioning and probing of reality that is logic."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Finally, the high-school years, ages 15 to 18, are devoted to self-expression, and beginning rhetoric classes use textbooks by Aristotle and Cicero. According to Veith, "The level of discourse, the depth of thinking, and what can only be described as a richness of character set the Logos seniors apart. Such are the benefits of a classical education."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Other attempts to construct an educational philosophy around the classical trivium are the Paideia Project -- used today in some 30 school districts nationwide -- and the Westside Preparatory School in Chicago. These schools help broaden the horizons of thousands of children, including poor children often written off as ineducable.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The classical approach to education is valuable, Veith contends, because it offers a "comprehensive, universal paradigm for learning." In his view, the classical education movement holds the key not only to educational reform but to an educational renaissance in America.

<p>
<b>Private Schools and Special Ed</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In <i>Meeting the Challenge</i>, Janet R. Beales, who directs the Reason Foundation's Study Program, points out that, contrary to a widely held myth, public schools do not accept every student. Students that public schools believe they cannot educate are often sent, at public expense, to private schools that specialize in the education of a certain type of student.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Beales distinguishes between three broad categories of difficult-to-educate students who are served by the private sector: "special-education" students are those with mental, physical, emotional, or disabilities. Over 100,000 students, or about 2 percent of the nation's special-education population, currently attend nonpublic schools at the public's expense. (Typically, the private school will operate under contract with government agencies at the local, state, or even federal level).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"At-risk students" include dropouts, teen parents, homeless youth and students with drug problems. School districts in at least 17 states contract with private schools to educate these students. Charter schools -- autonomous, publicly funded schools freed from most state and local regulations -- play an especially large role in serving these students.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"Adjudicated students" are juvenile criminals who, under compulsory state education laws, are required to attend school until a certain age. About 35,000 adjudicated youth are housed in 2,000 privately operated facilities, including training centers, ranches, shelters, halfway houses and group homes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Although meaningful comparisons between education outcomes for difficult-to-educate students in public and private schools are currently impossible, given the lack of reliable data, Beales documents the wide variety of learning environments provided by the private sector to deal with such students. These arrangements include residential schools, day schools, charter schools, independent study programs, religious schools, and home schools.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Given this wide variety of options, Beales contends, the commonly heard argument that school-choice policies would turn public schools into a "dumping ground" for the most difficult-to-educate students is simply not credible. On the contrary, a large-scale school-choice program would benefit these students by providing them with a "supply of schools as diverse as the students they are intended to serve." The fact that, even now, private schools already serve many students with special needs, sometimes enrolling the most difficult among them, "lays bare the myth of the public-school dumping ground."

<h2>Cautionary Tales</h2>

<b>Public Schools and Special Ed</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Although the cost of educating a child in New York City's public-school system comes to $8,000 per year, that figure, argues Kay S. Hymowitz in her profile of New York City's "special-ed" schools, is actually quite misleading. A full-time special-ed student costs the city $23,598 per year. A part-time special-ed student costs $10,207 per year. But an ordinary student receives only $5,148 in educational services per year. New York's "regular education system," Hymowitz argues, "resembles a parking lot full of 1968 cars, while special ed is like a handful of shiny new Cadillacs."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	All this might not be so bad if special-ed classes were actually helping their students. But two-thirds of special-ed students exiting the system in 1995, Hymowitz writes, dropped out instead of graduating. Of the remaining third, only half received a diploma that was worth anything.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	New York's special-ed system is a monument to good intentions gone awry. In 1975, Congress passed the All Handicapped Children Act, later called the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). Initially, the law called on the federal government to pay 40 percent of the cost of the vast program it had called into being. In fact, today Washington funds a mere 7 percent of the program, leaving New York taxpayers to pay the rest.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The law was based on several assumptions: First, that if a team of experts examined a child, it could evaluate his or her problem with scientific precision; second, that this team of experts, drawing on the latest scientific advances, could devise an effective program to treat the problem; and third, that educators could then successfully implement such a program, no matter what the cost. In fact, Hymowitz points out, the initial assumption was completely wrong: Different teams of experts, evaluating the same child, have issued sharply different diagnoses. And if assumption one is flawed, it follows that the others are unworkable.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Today, more than 60 percent of the children assigned to special-ed programs are classified as "learning disabled," a term so vague and expansive, writes Hymowitz, "that it is a standing invitation to any poorly performing child." Hymowitz believes that a substantial number of "learning disabled" children come from chaotic, problem-ridden families; their deprivation is cultural, not neurological. Yet the law governing special ed specifies that the category "learning disabled" should "not include children who have learning problems which are primarily the result of . . . environmental, cultural, or economic disadvantage." In other words, many of the students enrolled in expensive special-ed programs have no right to be there.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But there are powerful political forces blocking reform. Special-ed schools have provided jobs for thousands of psychologists, social workers, and evaluators. As a result, the unions are quite satisfied with the status quo. Parents of handicapped children also seem pleased with New York's special-ed program, and politicians, fearful of being accused of a lack of compassion, are unwilling to antagonize these parents. As a result, a special-education system that costs a great deal, accomplishes very little, and starves regular public schools of badly needed funds appears impervious to reform.

<b>Crime's Terrible Toll</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In <i>Body Count</i>, former Secretary of Education <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William J. Bennett</a> and his two co-authors, Princeton criminologist John DiIulio and John P. Walters, the former deputy director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, focus on what they call "superpredators," cruel, cold-blooded, shockingly young men who can and do kill at random, without rhyme, reason, or remorse, and without any fear of retribution. Over the next decade, they predict, the number of such superpredators is bound to increase substantially, leading to an unprecedented crime wave. "America is a ticking crime bomb," they declare, and when it explodes our streets will be inundated with young killers, possibly leading to an "authoritarian backlash" that will undermine our free institutions and bring us "only a short step away from achieving a quasi-police state."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The root cause of predatory street crime, the authors contend, is moral poverty. "By 'moral poverty'," they write, "we mean the poverty of being without loving, capable, responsible adults who teach the young right from wrong. . . . In the extreme, it is the poverty of growing up surrounded by deviant, delinquent, and criminal adults in a perfectly criminogenic environment -- that is, an environment that seems almost consciously designed to produce vicious, unrepentant, predatory street criminals."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Among the causes of moral poverty, Bennett and his co-authors cite the cultural revolution of the 1960s that undermined traditional values and institutions and a welfare system that subsidized illegitimacy and subverts the work ethic. But they pay particular attention to drugs, which, they argue, cause moral poverty by dissolving "the bonds of human and familial ties." By making drug-addicted parents indifferent to everything, including the well-being of their children, drugs sever family members not only from one another, but also from the traditional values of the larger society. Growing up in such families is like being raised by a pack of wolves, and those who survive the ordeal are likely to lack certain character traits -- such as empathy and impulse control -- that we think of quintessentially human.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	From this it follows that if we are serious about eradicating moral poverty, we must conduct an uncompromising war against drugs. The authors of <i>Body Count</i> argue that, contrary to widely-held misconception, America's war on drugs was yielding impressive results until the Clinton administration came into office. Since Clinton's election, however, "the nation has suffered the greatest increase in drug use and the largest expansion in the supply of illegal drugs ever measured." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Besides waging the war on drugs with renewed vigor, eradicating moral poverty requires that we reform our schools and our systems for criminal justice, welfare, and adoption. Most importantly, however, promoting traditional values among young members of the underclass requires the "re-moralization" of our culture through "a widespread renewal of religious faith and the strengthening of religious institutions."

<h2>A City's Assault on Teen Pregnancy</h2>
<b>By Joe Loconte</b>
<P></center>
<blockquote>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Eve Jackson taught "family life" classes to students in Hamilton Southeastern High School, a typical Indianapolis-area public school, for four years. They were troubling years for her Baptist conscience.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	At the exact time when the hormones of adolescents are at flood tide, Jackson says, the most persuasive message they get about sex comes from their peers -- and the message is: "Come on in, the water's fine." Other voices remain muffled. Teachers often ignore or play down a state requirement that they stress abstinence in sex-education classes. Church-state legal doctrine bans religious ideas about premarital sex from public schools. Says Jackson, "As much as I wanted to talk about God, I really couldn't."

</table>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	And what she could talk about -- responsible decision-making, peer pressure, self-esteem -- had no more effect than a flashing yellow light on a lonely country road. "So many of them were sexually active. Every year I had a couple of students who had abortions," she says. "But I couldn't talk them out of being sexually involved." Jackson eventually left public education, developed a Bible-based abstinence program taught by high-school juniors and seniors, and brought it into 34 Catholic grade schools throughout the city.



<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Now the public schools -- in a city with a teen pregnancy rate that has risen 40 percent over the last decade -- want Jackson back. Mayor Steve Goldsmith has asked Jackson to bring her chastity program, "A Promise to Keep," into 150 public grade schools this fall. Stripped of its religious references, the program will recruit at least 100 high-school students to serve as advocates for abstinence. It's one of more than two dozen initiatives launched by the mayor in the last year, using his bully pulpit in an effort to reduce out-of-wedlock births. Citing its impact on crime, poverty, and welfare dependence, Goldsmith calls teen pregnancy "the most serious long-term issue facing this city. We can do nothing if we don't solve this problem."<p><b>Energize and Stigmatize</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Unlike President Clinton's $30-million proposal to reduce illegitimacy, however, the mayor of the nation's 12th-largest city seems uninterested in expanding government services. Following a meeting last year that included the city's school superintendent, a juvenile-court judge, and a county health director, Goldsmith mapped out a 27-point strategy for city-wide action. His aim: energize public opinion, the courts, and church and community groups to stigmatize out-of-wedlock births while supporting teen mothers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The mayor intends to treat casual attitudes about teen pregnancy with the same tolerance that actor Jean-Claude Van Damme brings to flabbiness: Since studies show that roughly half of all teenage moms are impregnated by males older than 18, Goldsmith wants prosecutors to crack down on statutory rape. He plans to enforce laws requiring women to establish paternity as a condition of receiving welfare. He intends to publish monthly reports of teen pregnancies in every high school in the city.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	And while local Planned Parenthood clinics seek to build "creative self-expression" through dance, art, and painting classes, Goldsmith is pressuring schools to ban pregnant teens and boys who have fathered children from extracurricular activities. He even has floated the idea of sending pregnant girls to separate schools altogether.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"Philosophically we're not in agreement," says Kathleen Baldwin, Planned Parenthood's director of education in Indianapolis. "They would define the problem largely as illegitimacy, and we would define it as limited opportunities for achievement."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Esperanza Zendejas, the superintendent of Indianapolis's public schools, opposes some of the mayor's school-based sanctions, but applauds his broad-based approach to attacking the problem of illegitimacy. "The fact that the city, as a city, is looking at teen pregnancy is extraordinary," she says. "It should be happening in every city in the nation."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	It wouldn't be happening in Indianapolis without the active support of the religious community, Goldsmith says. Indeed, the mayor insists that the most dynamic partner in the assault on the culture of teen pregnancy -- and all of the social problems it creates -- will be churches and synagogues. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In February, he summoned 100 spiritual leaders -- Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Muslim, and Buddhist -- to a summit on teen pregnancy. He asked them to speak out on the risks of sexual activity outside of marriage. More significantly, he challenged congregations to become personally involved with families on welfare by helping women to avoid more pregnancies, reunite with the father of their children, and get off of government assistance. "The whole notion is to be more of a mentor and support group, not a candy store," says Richard Wiehe, the executive director of the Faith and Families project, a new effort to link congregations with welfare families.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The mayor wants religious groups to fight this culture war almost everywhere -- even in city parks. Indianapolis now has 16 congregations managing 30 contracts to maintain public parks. In exchange, churches can sponsor events in the parks with minimal bureaucratic hassle. Goldsmith's explicit hope is that people of faith will form relationships with children who live in surrounding neighborhoods. "We could put police officers on every corner of the city," he says, "but if our people did not believe in God and basic moral values, then we would still not have a safe community."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Crime statistics seem to side with the mayor: Juvenile crime in Indianapolis has increased nearly tenfold in the last decade, and 75 percent of those offenses were committed by fatherless children. Judge Jim Payne of the juvenile court of Marion County says at least 600 new juveniles enter the system each month. "Out-of-wedlock birth is driving every single rotten outcome in our city," says Krista Rush, Mayor's Goldsmith's social-policy advisor.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	At Goldsmith's request, the Indianapolis Training Center (ITC) set up shop in the city a few years ago to reach out to troubled youth and their families. Payne now refers kids headed for state detention centers to the Christian-based program, which houses about two dozen teens at a time in its residential center. To overcome objections by the Indiana Civil Liberties Union, Payne argued that the program's emphasis on character and family relationships could help reverse irresponsible or predatory attitudes toward sex that have become "incredibly common" among today's youth.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Center director Benny McWha says that many of the girls at the center were sexually abused as children, and are considered at high risk of teen pregnancy. Most of the boys come with no experience of responsible fatherhood. Eight mentor families and about a hundred student volunteers work to keep the kids out of trouble.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"Our primary goal is to help teach them character," McWha says, which includes "moral purity from a biblical perspective." The ITC staff also offers practical support -- and a message of abstinence -- to unmarried mothers in some of the city's toughest neighborhoods.<p><b>Modeling the Message</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Communicating an effective abstinence message may be the most difficult task facing the mayor, and the city's public schools are becoming a prime battleground. It is here where getting involved sexually is considered a badge of honor. And it is here where more and more pregnant teens are envied, admired, and applauded -- but rarely shunned. "In many of our schools," Rush says, "there's a tremendous reward for getting pregnant."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Jackson, who coordinates adolescent-growth programs for the Catholic Archdiocese of Indianapolis, cites three principles for overturning an ethos of sexual freedom: (1) Give kids a clear message of abstinence until marriage, (2) get the message to them early, and (3) recruit credible high-school students to deliver it.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
"There's a real need to have some positive peer pressure for a change," Jackson says. Young people are more likely to listen when student role models get involved. And, contrary to Planned Parenthood's news releases, finding chaste high schoolers is not a problem. Last year, Jackson recruited 200 peer mentors from six Catholic schools and six public schools to lead the workshops. She expects to train at least 50 students from Indianapolis high schools to work with kids in the city's middle schools this fall.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Though Jackson has removed all religious references from her public-school program, the six-hour curriculum parallels its religious counterpart in stressing chastity until marriage. Jackson essentially has translated religious concepts about the benefits of marriage -- and the risks of sexual permissiveness -- into secular language.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Moreover, most of Jackson's high-school mentors come from strong religious backgrounds. "We're finding that our peer mentors are people of faith," she says. "That faith component is essential, because it gives them a moral standard to live by. Otherwise, it's anything goes."

<b>Statement of Purpose</b><br>
<hr></center>
<p>
	Our mission is to revive the spirit of American citizenship by recovering the core political principles of our Founding Fathers and by articulating and advancing the conservative vision of civil society.<p>
	<i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i> illuminates the families, communities, voluntary associations, churches and other religious organizations, business enterprises, public and private schools, and local governments that are solving problems more effectively than large, centralized, bureaucratic government. Our goal is to stimulate the citizenship movement -- chronicling its success stories, exposing its obstacles and opportunities, and debating the policies that will best invigorate civil society.
<p>	American citizenship combines freedom with responsibility. These are the two great themes of modern conservatism, and they build on the best of the American tradition. Americans come from all races, all nationalities, all religions. Americans are united in citizenship not by common ancestry but by a common commitment to the political principles of the United States: the Constitution, the rule of law, the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 
<P>	Americans are united, too, by the common duties of citizenship: the obligation to protect our country from foreign enemies, to take care of our own families, to participate actively in civic life, to help our neighbors and communities when they are needy, and, in turn, not to take advantage of others' generosity when we can take care of ourselves.       <P><center><hr width=30%></center>
<P>	<i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i> is published by <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a>, a research and educational institute that formulates and promotes conservative public policies based on the principles of free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values, and a strong national defense.<P><center><bq>					"Without local institutions, a nation					may give itself a free government,					but it does not have the spirit of liberty."	<br>					—Alexis de Tocqueville, <i>Democracy in America</i></bq></center>

<h3> HOW STATES CAN FIGHT VIOLENT CRIME: TWO DOZEN STEPS TO A SAFER AMERICA </h3>

By Mary Kate Cary<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder No.  944/S<br>
June 7, 1993<br>
<hr width=50%>
</center><p>

<B> INTRODUCTION </B>
<P>

     Violent crime remains at intolerably high levels. Gang violence
is spreading across the country. And juveniles are committing more and
more serious crimes. At the same time, crime is becoming more ruthless
and wanton. Too many Americans -- especially residents of the inner
cities -- have become prisoners in their homes, behind bars and
chains. It is not surprising, therefore, that the strongest support
for tougher law enforcement is found among inner-city, largely
minority residents. (See Robert Rector, "A Comprehensive Urban Policy:
How to Fix Welfare and Revitalize America's Inner Cities," Heritage
Foundation Memo to President-Elect Clinton No. 12, January 18, 1993.) 
<P>
     Despite this plague, a powerful bloc of liberal lawmakers in
Congress prevented the passage of tough anti-crime measures proposed
by the Bush Administration. If President Clinton is to launch a war on
crime, he will have to overcome this resistance on Capitol Hill. 
<P>
     As Bill Clinton prepares his own initiatives on crime, he would
be wise to examine the recommendations of the report released last
year by former Attorney General William P. Barr. (For a copy of
Attorney General Barr's original report, "Combatting Violent Crime: 24
Recommendations to Strengthen Criminal Justice" and its "Citizen's
Checklist" of questions for state and local leaders, contact the U.S.
Department of Justice Public Affairs Office at (202) 514-2007.) The
report, entitled "Combatting Violent Crime," focuses on actions which
can be taken at the state and local levels. President Clinton should
call on governors and state legislators to act on the recommendations,
and he should frame federal legislation and policies to complement the
proposals.
<P>
     Real Results. When the federal government works with state
authorities, the combined assault on crime can yield real results.
Working with local police under "Operation Triggerlock," for example,
federal prosecutors were able to charge over 10,000 dangerous
criminals who used firearms in the operation's first eighteen months
alone (Summer 1991-Winter 1992). The average sentence for three-time
felons was eighteen years without parole. In another operation, 300
FBI agents were transferred from counter-espionage to anti-gang squads
in 39 cities across the country, and the federal RICO (Racketeer
Influenced Corrupt Organizations) statutes were used in many cases to
dismember violent gangs. Under the innovative "Operation Weed and
Seed," law enforcement resources were combined with social programs at
the local level to reduce crime in twenty targeted cities. And U.S.
Marshals, in one ten-week period, rounded up thousands of dangerous
fugitives in a massive manhunt named "Operation Gunsmoke."
<P>
     The Clinton Administration should continue to assist state and
local law enforcement officials in these ways. At the same time
President Clinton should build upon the progress made by Presidents
Ronald Reagan and George Bush in strengthening the federal criminal
justice system. During the 1980s, federal legislation reformed bail
laws to establish pretrial detention for dangerous offenders;
sentencing guidelines were initiated to ensure firm and consistent
punishment; mandatory minimum sentences were created and federal
parole was abolished to bring the amount of time served closer to the
amount of time imposed in criminal cases. In addition, substantial
resources were invested in federal law enforcement. The number of
prosecutors and federal law enforcement officials increased
significantly, and President Bush doubled federal prison capacity in
just three years. 
<P>
     Framework for States.Nevertheless, the impact of federal policy
necessarily is limited, since 95 percent of crimes fall within the
jurisdiction of state and local governments. But state and local law
enforcement agencies, with limited resources, are under great strain
to deal effectively with the increase of violence in this country. To
fight violent crime on the state and local levels, Attorney General
Barr made 24 recommendations in his report. Developed in partnership
with a broad array of non-partisan law enforcement officials, these
recommendations are a sound framework for state and local policy
makers seeking tough action on crime. And if the Clinton
Administration should fail to follow through on candidate Clinton's
anti-crime rhetoric, or weaken existing law enforcement programs
through the appointment of liberal jurists to the federal bench, it
will be all the more important for state and local officials to
strengthen law enforcement in their jurisdictions.
<P>
     Already there is evidence that the Clinton Administration is
backing away from tougher law enforcement. President Clinton's first
budget, for instance, substantially cuts resources for the Department
of Justice, and emphasizes social programs at the expense of law
enforcement. The Clinton Administration's budget request for federal
prison construction was $155 million for FY 1994, down from the Bush
Administration's FY 1993 request of $195 million, about a 20 percent
cut. Clinton seeks to reduce prison construction funds to $112 million
by 1998, down from a high of $1.3 billion spent by Bush in 1990 alone.
<P>
     It also appears that the Administration's new crime bill will
reverse many of the legislative reforms enacted during the last
decade, as well as some 22 Supreme Court decisions considered
favorable to law enforcement. It is thus state and local officials who
likely will have to take the lead in the only real opportunity to
improve America's criminal justice system. 
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> Barr's recommendations focus on five areas: 
<P>
     Protecting the community from dangerous criminals; 
<P>
     Assuring effective deterrence and punishment of adult and young
     offenders; 
<P>
     Creating more efficient trial, appeal, and post-appeal
     procedures; 
<P>
     Improving the detection and prevention of crime; and 
<P>
     Enhancing the role of the victim in the criminal justice process.</BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>   
     Many of the Barr recommendations are modeled after effective
federal statutes enacted during the last decade. President Clinton
should build upon these improvements. And state officials need to take
decisive measures at lower levels of government. Barr's 24
recommendations provide a foundation for such actions.
<P>

<B> THE TIDE OF VIOLENT CRIME IN AMERICA </B>
<P>
     State officials must address a simple fact: The United States is
in the grip of a violent crime wave.
<P>
     As the above graph shows, the number of violent crimes has jumped
dramatically in the last thirty years, over three times the rate in
the 1990s than in 1960. Measuring the increase in terms of population
over the same time period, the U.S. population has increased by 41
percent, while the violent crime rate has increased by more than 500
percent. As Heritage Foundation Distinguished Fellow William J.
Bennett, former National Drug Control Policy Director, observes, "The
rate of violent crime in the U.S. is worse than in any other
industrialized country." (See William J. Bennett, The Index of Leading
Cultural Indicators, published jointly by Empower America, The
Heritage Foundation, and the Free Congress Foundation, Washington D.C.
1993, p. 2.)
<P>
     As noted, the victims of violent crime tend to be
disproportionately poor and members of racial and ethnic minorities,
particularly blacks. "Given current crime rates," observes Bennett,
"eight out of every ten Americans can expect to be a victim of violent
crime at least once in their lives." (Ibid.)

<P>
<B> PROTECTING AMERICA'S COMMUNITIES FROM DANGEROUS CRIMINALS </B>
<P>
     Most of the criminal violence in American society is committed by
a very small group of chronic, violent offenders -- hardened criminals
who commit many violent crimes whenever they are out on the streets.
They begin committing crimes as juveniles, and they go right on
committing crimes as adults, even when on bail, probation, or parole. 
<P>
     The first duty of government is to protect its citizens. If law
enforcement officials are to make any progress in reducing violent
crime, their top priority must be to identify, target, and incarcerate
these hard-core, chronic offenders.
<P>
     The Barr report indicates ways in which state legislatures can
take decisive action to protect citizens:
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #1: Give judges legal authority for pretrial detention
     of dangerous defendants.
<P>
     Every state should grant statutory, and if necessary, state
constitutional authority to its trial judges to hold, without bail,
those defendants who are a danger to witnesses, victims, or the
community at large -- both before trial and pending appeal. 
<P>
     A study by the Department of Justice's Bureau of Justice
Statistics (BJS) of individuals on pretrial release in 75 of the
nation's most populous counties found that 18 percent of released
defendants were known to have been rearrested for the commission of a
felony while on pretrial release. Two-thirds of those rearrested while
on release were again released. (See Bureau of Justice Statistics,
U.S. Department of Justice, Pretrial Release of Felony Defendants,
1988 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1991), p. 1.
See also Lazar Institute, "Pretrial Release: A National Evaluation of
Practices and Outcomes," prepared for the National Institute of
Justice, U.S. Department of Justice, by Mary A. Toborg (October 1981),
Grant No. 71-NI-AX-0038, p. 48 (reporting similar rates of pretrial
rearrest).)
<P>
     This revolving door justice adds significantly to crime and
destroys public confidence in the criminal justice system. Law-abiding
citizens understandably are reluctant to inform police of criminal
activities when they know that those arrested will be back on the
street in a few days, or even in a few hours. Citizens fear
retaliation, intimidation, and harassment by returning criminals if
they help police. 
<P>
     Potent Tool. At the federal level, the Bail Reform Act of 1984
grants federal judges the authority to deny bail or pretrial release
to defendants who pose a danger to specific individuals or to the
community in general. (18 U.S.C. sec. 3141-56.) Under the Act,
criminal defendants with serious records, including the commission of
crimes while on release and those charged with serious drug felonies,
are presumed to be a danger to the community and therefore unsuitable
for release. The Act also creates a strong presumption that a
convicted offender will remain imprisoned during any post-conviction
appeal.
<P>
     Pretrial detention has helped federal prosecutors cripple
organized crime and drug rings. When pretrial detention is foregone,
defendants have the opportunity to intimidate or harm witnesses before
their trials. But when pretrial detention is enforced, dangerous
defendants are put behind bars until trial, where they are unable to
obstruct justice or pose a threat. Pretrial detention also increases
the protection afforded to witnesses and victims of crimes.
<P>
     Despite the proven effectiveness of the federal statute, and its
soundness as federal constitutional law, (The Supreme Court rejected a
constitutional challenge to the pretrial detention provisions of the
Bail Reform Act in United States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739 (1987).)
only a few states have effective pretrial detention provisions. In
many states, pretrial detention is not currently possible because of
an absolute right to bail in the state constitution. Thus where state
constitutional reform is necessary to remedy this, it should be
enacted. 
<P>
     States also should consider other key provisions of the Bail
Reform Act of 1984, such as the serious penalties for jumping bail and
enhanced penalties for crimes committed while on release.
<P>
     In Philadelphia in 1986, for example, a judge placed a limit on
the number of criminals that could be housed in the Philadelphia jail,
in order to prevent overcrowding. Released because of this order were
dangerous arrestees who otherwise would be held without bail or on
very high bond. The result was an increase in violent crimes committed
by the releasees. In the face of this crisis, the federal government
stepped in to use federal pretrial detention in cooperation with state
authorities. Over 600 gang members, who would have been turned loose
by state judges because there was no room to hold them, were placed in
federal facilities under federal law while awaiting trial. The
homicide rate in Philadelphia declined as a result. (See Mike Baylson
(U.S. Attorney ED-PA) and Willie Williams (Philadelphia Police
Commissioner), "Here's Why Murders are Down in the City," The
Philadelphia Inquirer, January 15, 1992, p. A13.)
<P>

<B> PUNISHING AND DETERRING VIOLENT CRIMINALS </B>
<P>
     Imprisoning the hard-core population of chronic, violent
offenders will reduce the level of violent crime in America. The
reason: When these criminals are on the streets, they are victimizing
citizens; when they are in prison, they are not committing crimes
against the public. While liberals may question the deterrent and
rehabilitative aspects of imprisonment, one thing is beyond debate:
Prison incapacitates chronic, repeat offenders.
<P>
     Consider the American experience of the last three decades. In
the 1960s and early 1970s, incarceration rates dropped and violent
crime rates skyrocketed. Conversely, when incarceration rates jumped
in the 1980s, the rate of increase of crime was substantially reduced.
(See Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Department of Justice,
Crime in the United States, Uniform Crime Reports 1959-90 (Washington,
D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, various years); Bureau of
Justice Statistics, U.S. Department of Justice, Historical Statistics
on Prisoners in State and Federal Institutions, Year end 1925-86
(Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1988) and
Prisoners in 1989 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office,
1990).) This is all the more impressive, considering the mid-1980s
"crack" drug epidemic and its associated violence.
<P>
     The best way to reduce crime is to identify, prosecute, and
incarcerate hard-core criminals. Study after study shows that a
relatively small portion of the population is responsible for the
lion's share of criminal violence in this country. For example, one
California study found that 3.8 percent of a group of more than
236,000 men born in 1956 were responsible for 55.5 percent of all
serious felonies committed by the study group. (These numbers are
derived from Robert Tillman, "Prevalence and Incidence of Arrest among
Adult Males in California," prepared for California Department of
Justice, Bureau of Criminal Statistics and Special Services,
Sacramento, California (1987).)
<P>
     Putting chronic offenders in prison for long periods, especially
upon second and third convictions, is the most effective way to reduce
violent crime.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #2: Restrict parole and increase the time actually
     served by violent offenders.
<P>
     An axiom of effective law enforcement is that punishment should
be swift, certain, and severe. Yet in too many jurisdictions, it is
none of these. In fact, most violent offenders who are sent to state
prison serve only a small fraction of their sentences. According to
the Bureau of Justice Statistics, analysis of release practices in 36
states and the District of Columbia in 1988 shows that although
violent offenders received an average sentence of seven years and
eleven months imprisonment, they served an average of only two years
and eleven months in prison -- or 37 percent of their imposed
sentence. Overall, 51 percent of the violent offenders in the survey
were discharged from prison in two years or less, and 76 percent were
out in four years or less. (See Bureau of Justice Statistics, U.S.
Department of Justice, National Corrections Reporting Program, 1988
(Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1992), tables 2-7
and 2-4.) 
<P>
     The adjacent chart shows the median sentence and time served in
prison for those released for the first time on a sentence in 1988.
(Ibid.)
<P>
     This huge gap between the nominal sentence given and the real
time served is dishonest, and it is bad policy. It is dishonest
because the public -- especially victims of crime -- is often under
the impression that the sentence will be served in full, when in fact
no such thing happens. It is bad policy because it puts the public at
risk. 
<P>
     There are several reasons why states should restrict parole
practices. First, parole is based on the mistaken idea that the
primary reason for incarceration is rehabilitation (prisoners can be
released as soon as they are rehabilitated, so the argument goes), and
ignores the deterrent, incapacitative, and retributive reasons for
imprisonment. A clear and truthful sentence increases the certainty of
punishment, and both its deterrent and incapacitative effects. 
<P>
     Second, in too many cases parole simply does not work. Studies of
the continuing failure of parole obscure the terrible human cost to
law-abiding citizens. (See, for example, Mark Vosburgh and Sean
Holton, "Florida Prison Failure Churns Out Crime Before Its Time,"
Orlando Sentinal, August 13, 1989, p. A-12; Mark Vosburgh, "Florida's
Early Releases: Flood of Rearrests May Sink Crowded Prisons," Orlando
Sentinal, December 17, 1989, p. A-1; U.S. Department of Justice,
Bureau of Justice Statistics, Recidivism of Prisoners Released in
1983, April 1989 (NCJ-116261); U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of
Justice Statistics, Examining Recidivism February 1985 (NCJ-96501);
U.S. Department of Justice, Bureau of Justice Statistics, Recidivism
of Young Parolees, May 1987 (NCJ-104916).) For example, Suzanne
Harrison, an eighteen-year-old honor student, three weeks from
graduation, left her home in Texas with two friends, nineteen and
twenty years old, on May 4, 1986. Her body was found the next day. She
had been raped, beaten, and strangled. Her two companions were shot to
death, and their bodies were found ten days later in a ditch. 
<P>
     Their killer, Jerry Walter McFadden (who calls himself "Animal"),
had been convicted previously of two 1973 rapes, and sentenced to two
fifteen-year sentences in the Texas Penitentiary. Paroled in 1978, he
was again sentenced to fifteen years in 1981 for a crime spree in
which he kidnapped, raped, and sodomized a Texas woman. Despite the
fact that his record now contained three sex-related convictions and
two prison terms, he was released again on parole in July 1985.
McFadden's crime spree finally came to an end when he was convicted of
the capital murder of Suzanne Harrison and sentenced to death in 1987.
McFadden raped and killed Harrison and killed her two friends less
than a year after being released on parole. This tragic example is all
too common, and the cost of failed parole practices to the public
safety is all too high. 
<P>
     Parole sometimes is used as an answer to prison overcrowding.
This is hardly a reasonable justification for the premature release of
violent criminals into the community. The answer to a lack of prison
space is to build more prisons, not to release dangerous criminals.
<P>
     Until recently, the Texas prison system was not expanding rapidly
enough to house that state's criminals. Under federal court order to
remain at a maximum of 95 percent of capacity, the Texas prison system
responded by increasing the number of inmates released on parole. The
number of felons on parole increased by 430 percent during the 1980s,
(See Bureau of Justice Statistics, U.S. Department of Justice,
Probation and Parole 1981 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing
Office, 1982), p. 2; Probation and Parole 1989 (Washington, D.C.: U.S.
Government Printing Office, 1990), table 1.) and inmates served an
average of only 62 days for each year of their sentence. (See Texas
Department of Corrections, 1991 Fiscal Year Statistical Report,
Summary Table 4 (1992).) As a result, reported crime rates in Texas
increased 29 percent in the 1980s, according to the FBI, while they
fell for the nation as a whole. (See Federal Bureau of Investigation,
U.S. Department of Justice, Crime in the United States, Uniform Crime
Reports, 1980, table 3 (1981) and 1989, table 5 (1990).)
<P>
     States should enact "truth in sentencing." Parole should be
restricted so that the sentence served more closely matches the
sentence imposed. While "good behavior" incentives may be used to
control prisoners, the mechanism should not exceed federal standards
requiring 85 percent of sentence to be served.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #3: Enact mandatory minimum sentences for gun
     offenders, armed career criminals, and repeat violent offenders.
<P>
     In many states, sentences for violent crimes are too short. To
many criminals, jail time is little more than a brief cost of doing
business. For example, in 1988, of an estimated 100,000 persons
convicted in state courts of murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated
assault, some 17 percent -- or about 17,000 violent criminals --
received sentences that included no prison time at all. (See Bureau of
Justice Statistics, U.S. Department of Justice, Felony Sentences in
State Courts, 1988 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office,
1990), p. 2.)
<P>
     State legislators should enact mandatory minimum sentences for
aggravated crimes of violence, and for such crimes committed by repeat
offenders. Every state should follow the example of federal law, which
mandates imprisonment where a firearm is used or possessed in the
commission of certain serious felonies. (18 U.S.C. sec. 924 (c) (1).) 
<P>
     Every state should also enact laws similar to the federal armed
career criminal statute, which targets repeat violent criminals who
possess a gun. (18 U.S.C. sec 924 (e).) Under federal law, any person
who has been convicted of three violent felonies or serious drug
offenses, and who illegally possesses a firearm, is sentenced to at
least fifteen years imprisonment without possibility of parole. There
are graduated, lesser penalties for those who have been convicted of
one or more prior felonies and illegally possess a gun. 
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #4: Build more prisons.
<P>
     As former Attorney General Barr says: "The choice is clear: More
prisons or more crime." Building more prisons is not only the morally
right thing to do, it is also economically the right thing to do. As
Heritage Foundation scholar Robert Rector argues, crime is a high tax
on the economic life of America's cities. (Rector, op. cit.) The cost
to society of releasing violent criminals prematurely is far higher
than the cost of building and operating prisons. When a violent
offender is released after conviction because of insufficient prison
space, all the money used to apprehend, try, and convict the criminal
is wasted. And although incarcerating criminals is not cheap, the cost
of not incarcerating criminals is far more expensive.
<P>
     The overall cost of crime to victims -- including direct losses,
pain and suffering, and risk of death -- has been estimated in the
billions of dollars. (See Mark A. Cohen, "Pain, Suffering and Jury
Awards: A Study of the Cost of Crime to Victims," Law and Society
Review, Vol. 22 (1988), p. 539. Cohen estimated the 1984 aggregate
cost of crime to victims at $92.6 billion in 1985 dollars.) And this
does not include larger costs of crime to society, such as lost sales,
because people are afraid to go out shopping; lost jobs, when
businesses leave crime-ridden neighborhoods; and lost tax revenues,
when sales, businesses, and jobs no longer exist.
<P>
     A study by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms of a group
of career criminals found each had committed an average of 160 crimes
a year. (See Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, U.S. Department
of the Treasury, Protecting America: The Effectiveness of the Federal
Armed Career Criminal Statute (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government
Printing Office, 1992), p. 29; see also Jan M. Chaiken and Marcia R.
Chaiken, Varieties of Criminal Behavior, prepared for the National
Institute of Justice, U.S. Department of Justice (Rand Corp., 1982),
p. 215.) A 1987 National Institute of Justice study estimated that the
average societal cost per crime in the nation was slightly more than
$2,300. (See National Institute of Justice, U.S. Department of
Justice, Making Confinement Decisions (Washington, D.C.: U.S.
Government Printing Office, 1987), p. 4.) When these costs are
compounded with the multiple crimes committed by the chronic offenders
mentioned above, the cost to society of not incarcerating each
criminal could exceed $350,000 per year.
<P>
     Despite the huge costs of not incarcerating criminals, states are
reluctant to invest in prison space. In fiscal year 1990, only 2.5
percent of total expenditures by state and local governments went for
corrections. And investment in new prison construction was only a
small fraction of that figure, according to 1989-1990 figures on
government finances from the Bureau of the Census. (See Bureau of the
Census, U.S. Department of Commerce, Government Finances: 1989-90
(Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1991), p. 2.)
<P>
     While there are those who argue that America is using prison
space for many people who do not belong there, the truth is that 93
percent of those in prison are repeat or violent offenders (the rest
are drug traffickers or burglars). (See Bureau of Justice Statistics,
U.S. Department of Justice, Prisons and Prisoners in the United States
(Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1992), p. 16.) In
the face of the overwhelming need for more prison space, spending on
corrections remains a tiny percentage of state and local budgets.
States need to commit sufficient resources to building and operating
prisons, or risk the continuing collapse of the criminal justice
system.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #5: Impose an effective death penalty for the most
     heinous crimes.
<P>
     The death penalty has an important role to play in deterring and
punishing the most heinous violent crimes. ( On the deterrent effects
of capital punishment: see generally Stephen J. Markman and Paul G.
Cassell, "Protecting the Innocent: A Response to the Bedau-Radelet
Study," Stanford Law Review, Vol. 41 (1988), pp. 121, 154-56
(collecting studies that demonstrate deterrent effects of the death
penalty); Stephen K. Layson, "Homicide and Deterrence: A Reexamination
of the United States Time-Series Evidence," Southern Economics
Journal, Vol. 52 (1985), pp. 68, 75-80 (estimating that each execution
in the U.S. deters approximately eighteen murders). On its retributive
effects: see, for example, Senate Committee on the Judiciary,
Establishing Constitutional Procedures for the Imposition of Capital
Punishment, S. Rep. No. 251, 98th Cong., 1st Sess. (1983), p. 13
("Murder does not simply differ in magnitude from extortion or
burglary or property destruction offenses; it differs in kind. Its
punishment ought to also differ in kind. It must acknowledge the
inviolability and dignity of innocent human life. It must, in short,
be proportionate.").) But it must be a real and certain penalty to be
effective. In addition to its deterrent value, capital punishment
permanently removes extremely violent offenders from society. And the
death penalty upholds society's goal of just retribution: It affirms
the moral outrage of the community at the ruthless taking of human
life and assures the victim's loved ones that society takes their loss
seriously. 
<P>
     At the very least, states should make the death penalty an option
for juries to consider in three situations:
<P>
First, it is appropriate for the killing of a law enforcement officer.
     This sends a clear message to violent criminals: Murdering a
     police officer to avoid identification or later arrest is not
     worth it, no matter how long a prison term the criminal faces.
<P>
Second, it is appropriate for those who kill while also committing
     serious felonies. In the California case of People v. Love, (366
     P.2d 33, 41-42 (Cal. 1961).) a collection of convicts' statements
     from police files and other sources indicates that their
     decisions to use toy guns during felonies, not to use firearms to
     resist arrest, and not to kill hostages were motivated by fear of
     the death penalty. The death penalty raises the stakes for these
     criminals, and therefore helps protect the victims of their
     crimes. 
<P>
Third, it is appropriate for killing while in prison. Many criminals
     already serving life sentences in jail feel they have little to
     lose by killing a correctional officer or fellow inmate. The
     death penalty introduces a new level of punishment.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #6: Require prisoners to work or perform community
     service to defray the costs of their imprisonment.
<P>
     Taxpayers pay for a prisoner's room and board, health care, and
all other expenses. In return, able-bodied prisoners should be
required to do something useful for the taxpayers, such as maintaining
prison property. Restrictions on this practice should be applied only
where there is a significant risk of taking jobs away from law-abiding
American workers.
<P>
     There are many benefits associated with prison work. The Federal
Bureau of Prisons recently published preliminary findings from its
Post Release Employment Project (PREP), which compared federal
convicts who received training and work in prison with a control group
which did not. The study's preliminary findings offer strong support
for prison labor programs: Inmates who worked in prison were less
likely to engage in prison misconduct, less likely to commit crimes
after release, and significantly more likely to be gainfully employed
one year after release. (See Federal Bureau of Prisons, U.S.
Department of Justice, Post Release Employment Project, Preliminary
Findings (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1991),
pp. 6, 10-11.)
<P>
     States should enact laws or promulgate regulations requiring all
able-bodied felons in prison to perform some labor useful to the
public. State legislators also should enact laws making a certain
percentage of the cost of each prisoner's incarceration part of a
mandatory fine imposed as part of sentence. Proceeds from both of
these should be used to defray correctional costs.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #7: Impose drug testing throughout the criminal justice
     process.
<P>
     Violence is a way of life for those who use and distribute drugs.
More than a third of state prisoners serving time for a violent crime
said they were under the influence of drugs at the time the offense
occurred. (See Bureau of Justice Statistics, U.S. Department of
Justice, Sourcebook of Criminal Justice Statistics, 1988 (Washington,
D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1988), p. 624.) 
<P>
     States should impose drug testing on those arrested for certain
felonies. This would enable judges to decide more appropriately the
conditions for pretrial release and sentencing after conviction.
Random drug testing in prison also would help cut use in prisons and
discourage the smuggling of drugs into prisons. In addition, periodic
drug tests generally should be required of prisoners on supervised
release after conviction for a serious felony, and the use of drugs
during probation or parole should result in automatic revocation of
release status. Finally, where possible, the cost of these drug tests
should be offset by a fee imposed on those tested. 
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #8: Seize assets to fight crime and to supplement law
     enforcement resources.
<P>
     Asset forfeiture is a one-two punch in the fight against crime.
First, it strips criminals of their ill-gotten gains -- it assures
them that crime does not pay. And second, it reinvests those assets as
funding for law enforcement programs. In fiscal year 1991 alone, the
U.S. Department of Justice deposited $643.6 million into the Asset
Forfeiture Fund and shared $266.8 million in cash and $21.2 million in
property with state and local law enforcement organizations as a
result of joint operations. (Executive Office for Asset Forfeiture,
Office of the Deputy Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice,
Annual Report of the Department of Justice Asset Forfeiture Fund,
Fiscal Year 1991 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office,
1992), pp. 53, 55.)
<P>
     States can use this sanction in addition to criminal prosecution
in drug trafficking and certain violent crime cases. Still, asset
forfeiture laws should also be applied constitutionally, with proper
regard for due process protections. To assist states in doing so, the
Department of Justice, with the National District Attorneys
Association and the National Association of Attorneys General, has
developed a Model Asset Seizure and Forfeiture Act which contains a
comprehensive set of recommendations for states.

<P>
PUNISHING AND DETERRING YOUNG CRIMINALS
<P>
     Juvenile crime has risen rapidly over the last two decades,
especially violent offenses. The real answer to this problem lies
outside the criminal justice system. As Heritage Foundation scholar
Robert Rector demonstrates, it is the basic institutions of society --
family, schools, churches, and neighborhood groups -- that instill
values and mold children into good citizens. (Rector, op. cit.) Only
when these institutions once again intervene effectively in shaping
the lives of young Americans will juvenile crime be cut substantially.
<P>
     Still, law enforcement has a key role. State legislators and
officials need to distinguish between categories of juvenile
offenders. The vast majority of juvenile offenders have only one or
two brushes with the law and straighten out as they mature. But there
is a smaller group of chronic hardened juvenile offenders, who commit
most of the violent juvenile crime. Unfortunately, juveniles are the
fastest growing group of violent offenders. As the following graph
shows, the arrest rates of juveniles for violent crime have increased
significantly in recent years, particularly since 1985. (Bennett, op.
cit., p. 4.) And the increase in juvenile crimes is responsible for a
large share of the general increase in violent crime. (See Federal
Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Department of Justice, Age-Specific
Arrest Rates and Race-Specific Arrest Rates for Selected Offenses,
1965-89 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1990), pp.
31, 73, 213.)

     <P>
RECOMMENDATION #9: Toughen juvenile sanctions to deter nonviolent
     first-time offenders from a life of crime. 
<P>
     In the case of the first, larger group of juvenile offenders, the
goal of policy makers and law enforcement officials is to prevent
these youths from becoming chronic offenders. The best way to do this
is to impose tough sanctions that are carefully tailored to the
offender and are meant to instill the values of discipline and
responsibility. Excessive leniency, on the other hand, wastes the
opportunity to turn the young person around, and instead puts him or
her on the conveyor belt to becoming a career criminal. The juvenile
does not get the message that crime does not pay when he or she is not
penalized for committing a crime. Tough but fair sanctions can stop
the all-too-common pipeline from juvenile offender to adult criminal. 
<P>
     To this end, state officials should develop a range of sanctions
for nonviolent first-time juvenile offenders, with the emphasis on
instilling discipline and responsibility in a tough but fair manner.
To be effective, these sanctions should include institutional
settings, including "boot camps" and highly structured community
service programs, as an alternative to probation. And the use of these
structured sanctions must be for a period long enough to bring about a
change in the pattern of behavior.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #10: Target the small group of chronic violent juvenile
     offenders and treat them as adults.
<P>
     One of the worst statistics from the 1980s is the sharp increase
in the number of juveniles arrested for murder: It rose by 60 percent
between 1981 and 1990, according to the FBI. The corresponding adult
increase was 5.2 percent. In 1990, more than a third of all murders in
America were committed by people under the age of 21. (See Federal
Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Department of Justice, Crime in the
United States, Uniform Crime Reports, 1990 (Washington, D.C.: U.S.
Government Printing Office, 1991), tables 27 and 36.) The growth of
violent juvenile gangs and the tendency of drug rings to use young
teens as drug couriers, enforcers, and even "hit men" have contributed
to this alarming trend. There is an attitude of "Let the kid do it"
among criminals on the street, because of the leniency of many state
juvenile justice systems.
<P>
     For example, in 1988 a fourteen-year-old drug runner in the
District of Columbia shot and killed three people on the same day. The
drug dealer for whom the juvenile worked was convicted of felony
murder, but the juvenile served only 26 months in juvenile detention
for the killings. He was back out on the streets taunting local police
before his seventeenth birthday. (See "D.J.," Washington Post
editorial, July 31, 1991, p. A20.)
<P>
     State criminal justice officers must realize that some youthful
offenders are simply hardened criminals who happen to be young. The
challenge for state officials is to identify this small group of hard-
core offenders and treat them as adults -- which may require some
reform of existing procedures.
<P>
     State legislators should ensure, for example, that their legal
systems permit the discretionary waiver or certification of juveniles
into adult court in appropriate circumstances. One approach would be
to create a legislative presumption that any juvenile age fourteen or
older who commits certain crimes of violence (murder, rape, kidnaping,
armed robbery, for example) will be tried as an adult. The presumption
could be rebutted by showing mitigating factors that argue otherwise. 
<P>
     But where violence is involved, a firearm is used, or multiple
offenses have occurred, the youth has already -- through his own
willful criminal conduct -- left the intended focus of the juvenile
justice system.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #11: Allow judges to use juvenile offense records in
     adult sentencing.
<P>
     Many seemingly first-time adult offenders in this country were
chronic offenders as juveniles, yet evidence of their crimes may not
be available or may be considered legally irrelevant to sentencing for
adult crimes. The Bureau of Justice Statistics estimates that 38
percent of convicted murderers in state prison in 1986 had a prior
juvenile conviction; and 13 percent of those had no adult record, only
juvenile ones. (The figures are similar for other violent crimes. For
example, 54 percent of state prisoners convicted of robbery as adults
had a juvenile record -- 15 percent had only prior juvenile
convictions. These figures are based on the raw data underlying the
BJS Special Report, Profile of State Prison Inmates, 1986 (Washington,
D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, 1988).) While it is commendable
to forgive a youthful indiscretion and not penalize an otherwise law-
abiding adult with a criminal record, that is hardly reasonable when a
juvenile offender continues a life of crime into adulthood.
<P>
     To address this problem, the FBI now includes juvenile criminal
history information from the states in the national criminal records
system, and states are urged to forward records of serious offenses to
the FBI. So that this is possible, state officials should review their
expungement and confidentiality statutes affecting juvenile offenses.
State laws, moreover, should allow for the fingerprinting of juveniles
convicted of serious crimes, and career criminal statutes should
provide that juvenile convictions for serious drug and violent crimes
be considered relevant factors in the sentencing of adults.
<P>

<B> PROMOTING FAIR AND SPEEDY TRIALS AND STREAMLINING THE APPEALS PROCESS </B>
<P>
     While it is essential for state officials to increase the
certainty and severity of punishment, it is equally important to
ensure its swiftness and finality. The key to this is the ability of
the criminal justice system to seek and find the truth. Several steps
would help achieve this, substantially enhancing the efficiency of
state criminal justice systems and the deterrent effect of their
punishments.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #12: Enforce speedy trial laws.
<P>
     Victims of crime and members of society at large want to see
justice done and criminals removed quickly from society. Defendants
have an interest in clearing their good names if innocent, or in
beginning to serve their sentences if guilty. All sides have an
interest in determining the facts while evidence and the recollections
of witnesses are still fresh.
<P>
     Despite the clear common interest in speedy trials, and despite
the fact that some form of speedy trial law exists in 45 states, (See
Bureau of Justice Statistics, U.S. Department of Justice, Prosecution
of Felony Arrests, 1981 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing
Office, 1986), table 30.) delays in prosecution still pervade many
state systems. In fact, a 1988 study of felony convictions in 300
counties across America found that the average time between arrest and
sentencing was 208 days -- even longer in violent felony and drug
trafficking cases. (See Bureau of Justice Statistics, U.S. Department
of Justice, Felony Sentences in State Courts, 1988 (Washington, D.C.:
U.S. Government Printing Office, 1990), p. 7.) 
<P>
     These delays benefit no one but the guilty -- and cause
particular anguish and even danger to the victims of violent crime
awaiting the trial proceedings. Many docket-management techniques are
available to clerks and other state officials to help states ensure
criminal trials take place at the earliest possible date. They should
be used more aggressively.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #13: Reform the rules of evidence to secure the truth
     in criminal trials. 
<P>
     The cost of keeping probative evidence away from juries in
criminal cases is very high, and can result in the release of guilty
criminals to further victimize the innocent. State officials should
review their evidentiary rules to ensure that they promote the search
for truth.     
<P>
     State laws also should allow for admission of evidence seized by
officers acting with an objectively reasonable belief that they are
complying with the law. State legislators can, for example, ensure by
statute that whenever police officers act in good faith, but make a
technical error of law or fact, the evidence should nevertheless be
admitted in court. (In recent years, the Supreme Court has identified
a number of situations where it has declined to apply the exclusionary
rule to enforce the Fourth Amendment; primary among these is the 1984
case of U.S. v. Leon.) Colorado, for example, has enacted a good faith
exception to the exclusionary rule for both warrant and warrantless
cases. In some states, however, this may require a constitutional
amendment.
<P>
     State officials also should review evidence rules governing the
use of prior convictions or acts. There are two settings in which this
is particularly important. The first is in the impeachment of a
defendant who takes the stand. Traditionally, any past conviction for
a felony or a crime involving dishonesty was admissible to impeach the
credibility of the witness. Now, Federal Rule of Evidence 609 imposes
a general ten-year time limit on admissible convictions and requires a
special determination by the judge that the probative value of a
defendant's prior felonies outweighs any prejudicial effect.
<P>
     At a minimum, state evidence codes should be no more restrictive
than Rule 609. Allowing the admission of all convictions involving
felonies and crimes involving dishonesty against all witnesses
(including a defendant) would be even better.
<P>
     Second, many state evidence rules limit the use of past criminal
conduct of the defendant as evidence of guilt. Evidence that the
defendant has committed the same type of crime in the past is
particularly probative in sex crime cases, such as rape and child
molesting, where it shows common modus operandi or other relevant
factors. Studies suggest that recidivism runs high among a substantial
percentage of sex offenders, (See, for example, Bureau of Justice
Statistics, U.S. Department of Justice, Special Report, Recidivism of
Prisoners Released in 1983 (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing
Office, 1989), table 10.) and such information may be key to an
informed evaluation of the credibility of the defendant's denial and
the victim's allegations. In such cases, often the only eyewitness is
the victim, who carries the burden of proof in the trial. State
legislators should provide clear statutory authority for the admission
of evidence of past sex offenses whenever the charge is sexual assault
or child molestation.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #14: Reform state habeas corpus procedures and end
     repetitive challenges by convicted criminals. 
<P>
     In recent years, the writ of habeas corpus has been transformed
from a monument of individual liberty, protecting individuals from
imprisonment without trial, into a device used by prisoners to
reexamine endlessly the issues decided by a full trial, and often even
after unsuccessful appeals. The result: a sapping of judicial
resources, a diminishing of punishment, and a continuing torment of
victims of violent crime.
<P>
     State officials should thoroughly review their habeas corpus laws
to deter frivolous litigation and to close loopholes that can be
abused. Four specific reforms would help improve many state laws:
<P>
States should allow only truly collateral claims to be raised in state
     habeas corpus cases. Any claim that was or could have been
     brought forward in a prisoner's direct appeals should be barred
     explicitly from habeas proceedings.
<P>
States should adopt explicit time limits for the filing of habeas
     corpus petitions (as there are for other categories of cases,
     from tort suits to contract claims), beginning from the time the
     petitioner has concluded his direct appeals.
<P>
States should bar successive habeas corpus petitions, except where
     sufficient cause is shown for previous failure to raise the claim
     and the claim, if proved, would address the prisoner's factual
     guilt. 
<P>
States should adopt the retroactivity standard of the 1988 Supreme
     Court case Teague v. Lane, (489 U.S. 288 (1989)) which provides
     that changes in the law after trial and appeal will not apply
     retroactively unless they prohibit a particular crime or
     sentence, or greatly improve the truth-seeking function of the
     trial.
<P>

<B> DETECTING AND PREVENTING CRIME </B>
<P>
     Police and prosecutors in this country are in general doing an
excellent job. But their efforts are often frustrated by a cumbersome
and bureaucratic system that does not give them the tools they need to
get the job done. These tools include proper equipment, better
training, and the appropriate legal authority to apprehend and convict
violent offenders. Law enforcement is not just another line item in
the state budget -- it is the first duty of government. State
legislators should realize that something is wrong if this is not
reflected in budgetary priorities.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #15: Invest in quality law enforcement personnel and
     coordinate social welfare programs with law enforcement
     resources.
<P>
     Members of the police force today are often outgunned by drug
traffickers and gangs, who have access to high-powered weapons and
ordnance. The police need top quality equipment. States should make
sure their officers have adequate firepower and should make body armor
available to every officer. Use of body armor should be mandatory for
officers charged with the execution of arrest and search warrants. 
<P>
     Prosecutors likewise deserve and require adequate tools. In the
face of increasingly complex cases involving money laundering,
racketeering, search and seizure, and intricate drug distribution
rings, specialized training is often needed but not always available.
Likewise, state judges and clerks of court, handling ever-larger
criminal caseloads, need adequate support staff and equipment for case
management. 
<P>
     State officials should in addition coordinate law enforcement
resources with other public expenditures. While it is true that law
enforcement cannot do the job alone, it is also true that social
programs cannot succeed without effective law enforcement. (For a
comprehensive strategy of social and welfare reforms, coupled with a
law enforcement program, see Rector, op. cit.) What good is it to
build the finest schools, only to have them taken over by gangs? What
good are costly improvements in public housing, if units then are
converted into crack houses for drug dealers? Community revitalization
efforts must be combined with tough law enforcement to successfully
reduce violence and improve the lives of those held in its grip. (See
Carl F. Horowitz, "An Empowerment Strategy for Eliminating
Neighborhood Crime," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 814, March
5, 1991.) The "Weed and Seed" concept, a model program begun by the
Department of Justice in 1991, does just this. Federal, state, and
local law enforcement agencies pool their resources to "weed out"
targeted street gangs and drug dealers. Social programs can then take
root in the crime-free area, "seeding in" opportunity and hope for
residents. Between the two elements, community policing acts as a
bridge, so that police and community groups can build a productive
relationship to help prevent crime from resurfacing in the
neighborhood.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #16: Computerize criminal history records in a
     reliable, accurate, and timely fashion.
<P>
     Quick access to accurate criminal history records is important
for two reasons: First, criminal history records are necessary in
deciding pretrial detention issues. A past record of violence or
failure to appear is crucial information to a judge deciding whether
to detain a defendant. Second, reliable criminal history records are
the key to effective career criminal statutes, important for general
sentencing purposes, and vital for resource planning in the justice
system. Also, a criminal records data base is the foundation for a
point-of-sale check prior to firearms purchases. 
<P>
     Many states have serious problems with delays and backlogs in
reporting the final disposition of cases. These delays can mean a
three-month lag, or longer, between the end of the trial and the entry
of the data. To help alleviate this problem, the Department of Justice
set aside $27 million in 1992 to be made available to the states over
three fiscal years to upgrade the quality of their criminal history
records systems. In addition, since late 1992, all states must
dedicate at least five percent of federal formula grants from the
Department of Justice to improve their criminal history records (at
present levels this would total more than $21 million in additional
federal dollars each year).
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #17: Give prosecutors statutory authority to tighten up
     and target the rules for immunity from prosecution.
<P>
     Offering immunity selectively often is the only way of breaking
into drug enterprises, violent gangs, and sophisticated organized
crime operations. Accomplices and lower-level gang members often are
the only eyewitnesses to suspected crimes by superiors in a criminal
organization.
<P>
     Prosecutors also often must grant immunity to witnesses in order
to prevent them from asserting their Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination. Federal prosecutors have the choice of granting
two types of immunity: "Use" immunity prohibits the government from
using the compelled testimony, either directly or indirectly, to build
a case against a witness. It is possible, however, to prosecute based
on other independently gathered evidence. "Transactional" immunity
protects an immunized witness from prosecution for any criminal
transaction mentioned in the compelled testimony. Prosecution is
barred by transactional immunity even where independent evidence of
criminality is discovered. 
<P>
     Right now, state laws are a hodgepodge on the subject of
immunity. Despite the fact that the United States Supreme Court has
held that "use" immunity is constitutionally sufficient, several
states still provide only for transactional immunity, which eliminates
forever the opportunity to prosecute these witnesses even if the
evidence of their crimes was gathered independently of their
testimony. In addition, several states provide for automatic
transactional immunity to all grand jury witnesses. 
<P>
     State immunity laws should be comparable to the federal immunity
statute (18 U.S.C. sec. 6002.) -- prosecutors should be granted the
authority to request immunity and to decide whether it should be use
or transactional. Otherwise, investigations can be thwarted, and
clever witnesses can literally get away with murder. (See New York
State District Attorneys Association, "The Case for a New Immunity Law
in New York" (1988), p. 6.)
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #18: Allow the use of sophisticated electronic
     surveillance technology.
<P>
     With the advent of large-scale illegal drug trafficking and
organized crime cases, especially those involving Asian gangs and Cosa
Nostra families, electronic surveillance of suspects is essential. The
leaders of these organizations often are able to avoid direct
involvement in crimes while planning and coordinating increasingly
sophisticated criminal activity over the phone. Electronic
surveillance can build an extremely effective case by using the
criminal's own words, while also avoiding the risks of using
undercover agents or informants.
<P>
     One way to penetrate sophisticated criminal networks
electronically is to use a "pen register," a device which records the
outgoing numbers dialed from a telephone. The United States Supreme
Court has held that the use of a pen register is not a search within
the meaning of the Fourth Amendment, and thus neither probable cause
nor a warrant is needed to use one. (See Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S.
735 (1979).)
<P>
     Conversely, a trap-and-trace device, like Caller ID, reveals the
phone number of all incoming calls to a particular number. In order to
use such a device, federal law requires police application to a court
and a showing that the information obtained from its use will be
relevant to an ongoing criminal investigation. (18 U.S.C. sec.
3121-27.) The statute, while creating a legal obligation for phone
companies, landlords, and others to assist police in the installation
of these devices, also provides protection for law enforcement
officers and telephone companies from civil and criminal liability for
actions taken under the statute.
<P>
     Currently, some fifteen states make no provision for court-
ordered electronic surveillance. Others, such as California, have weak
electronic surveillance laws. Others require warrants and probable
cause. 
<P>
     State legislators should review these laws to ensure that
statutory authority exists for electronic surveillance, pen registers,
and trap-and-trace devices. Statutory and constitutional change should
be made where needed.
<P>

<B> ASSURING VICTIMS' RIGHTS </B>
<P>
     Criminal justice serves a twofold purpose: to bring criminals to
justice, and to bring justice to victims. One way to make sure that
appropriate weight is given to victims' rights is to codify and
enforce a "Victims' Bill of Rights." Congress did just this in the
Victims' Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 and urged the states to
follow suit. Victims of a crime have the right to be protected from
further violence, to expect restitution from financial loss, and to
participate in the criminal justice process. And the criminal justice
system should do all it can to lessen the pain of victims and victim-
witnesses. 
<P>
     Potential victims of crime also have the right to protection.
Victims of stalkers, for instance, should not have to wait until they
are attacked to have effective recourse. State legislators should
enact stalking laws that make it a crime to harass or follow a person
if it puts the victim in fear of death or serious injury. If a
restraining order is in effect at the time of an attack, an enhanced
penalty should be considered.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #19: Give victims a hearing and consideration at
     sentencing.
<P>
     In most states, defendants have the right to address the court
after conviction and before sentencing -- to tell their story and to
ask for mercy. State officials should provide the victim with a
similar right to inform the court about the impact of the crime on his
or her life before a sentence is given. The right should be extended
to victims' families in capital cases. Likewise, parole statutes
should provide that the impact of early release on victims or their
survivors be a consideration bearing on early release decisions or
other discretionary actions of the parole authority.
<P>
     The victim also should have a right to be present at all public
court proceedings related to the crime, which is often the most
traumatic thing that has ever happened to that person. Victims deserve
the right to watch the criminal justice system address the wrong done
to them.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #20: Help victim-witnesses with case coordinators.
<P>
     Victim-witness coordinators are an important link between victims
of crime and the criminal justice system, keeping victims apprised of
developments in the case, informing them of possibilities of
restitution, and notifying them of the release status of the offender.
Victim-witness coordinators should be made more aware of the state
programs funded through the Victims of Crime Act, and such services
offered by programs for victim compensation and assistance,
counseling, and even shelter for battered women.
<P>
     
RECOMMENDATION #21: Assure restitution, adequate compensation, and
     assistance for victims of crime.
<P>
     While every state has some type of victim restitution law, not
all are well enforced. Effective mechanisms for collecting fines and
restitution payments must exist, so that victims are relieved of the
humiliating task of having to chase down the offender personally to
obtain recompense for their injuries.
<P>
     State officials should also make sure that any profits a criminal
makes directly or indirectly from his crimes -- including from book
and movie deals -- are made available to the victim for restitution.
Where possible, states also should provide for reasonable compensation
for victim-witnesses, including payment for travel and loss of work
time, and assistance with day care and similar costs of giving
testimony.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #22: Adopt rules to protect victim-witnesses from
     courtroom intimidation and harassment. 
<P>
     Every state should enact two evidentiary protections for
complaining witnesses. The first is the rape-shield law. A good model
is Federal Rule of Evidence 412, which makes reputation or opinion
evidence concerning the past sexual behavior of the alleged victim
inadmissible in the trial for sex crimes. Admission of such evidence
violates the victim's privacy, increases the trauma of the trial, and
discourages victims from coming forward in the first place.
<P>
     Second, every state should protect child witnesses from traumatic
confrontations with their alleged abusers. In the 1990 case of Craig
v. Maryland, the Supreme Court noted that placing a child witness in
proximity to an alleged abuser or molester may do serious
psychological damage, and may overwhelm the child so much that he
cannot accurately testify to events. 
<P>
     The Maryland statute, upheld by the Supreme Court in Craig,
provides a useful model. If the trial judge deems it necessary, the
child's testimony is taken by closed-circuit television with only the
attorneys and, if necessary, a guardian present.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #23: Require HIV testing of sex offenders before trial.
 <P>
     Because of the AIDS epidemic, sex crimes have become even more
terrifying and traumatic for victims. At the request of the victim,
states should provide for mandatory HIV testing of defendants in
sexual offense cases before trial, in order to reduce the uncertainty
victims must endure. Test results should be available to the victim
and to the court in a way that safeguards the victim's
confidentiality. Also, at the request of the victim, defendants should
be tested again periodically, consistent with the latency period of
the HIV virus. Most important of all, states should provide enhanced
penalties for HIV-positive offenders who commit sexual offenses in the
knowledge that they may transmit the virus to the victim.
<P>
RECOMMENDATION #24: Notify victims of all criminal justice proceedings
     and the release status of the offender.
<P>
     Many victims of crime understandably fear that they will be
victimized again by the same offender after his release. Victims
should be told of any change in a convicted criminal's status, such as
enrollment in work-release programs, weekend furlough, or community
incarceration. States should also ensure that adequate protective
measures be taken before release, where there is a legitimate fear of
more victimization.

<P>
<B> CONCLUSION </B>
<P>
     On the federal level, President Clinton should use the power of
his office to continue the federal effort against crime. In so doing,
he should build upon the progress of his predecessors, Presidents
Reagan and Bush, in strengthening the criminal justice system. 
<P>
     At the same time, state legislators and judicial officials can
and should take concrete steps to make America safer. Concerned
citizens, victims of crime, and law enforcement leaders are working to
strengthen the criminal justice system. Law-abiding citizens, however,
are asking if their state and local public safety laws are as
effective as those of the federal government and the more rigorous
states. They want police and prosecutors to have the tools they need
to combat gangs, drug dealers, and chronic violent offenders. They
want states to ensure that dangerous criminals are in prison, not in
their neighborhood. And they want victims of crime to have the same
say as the criminals do in the system. The recommendations of the Barr
report provide a sound foundation for making the fundamental changes
necessary to protect the safety of all Americans.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"We're not report takers. We're the police."<sup>2</sup>  This bold message greets visitors to the New York City Police Department's crime strategy center, where for three hours, twice a week, the city's 76 precinct commanders gather to report their challenges and successes. And during William J. Bratton's brief tenure as Commissioner of Police, the department achieved some stunning successes: since 1993, a 36 percent drop in serious crimes, including a 44 percent drop in auto theft and a 45 percent drop in murder.<sup>3</sup>  Bratton's winning strategy: Hammer home his aggressive, crime-fighting, morale-building message to his troops while demanding (and getting) measurable results in combating crime and disorder from his commanders in the field.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

It is possible to achieve dramatic reductions in crime. As a result of New York City's success, "Mayors, police chiefs, and scholars from San Diego to Singapore to Saudi Arabia come crowding into the NYPD's meeting room to learn first hand how this new technique works," says George L. Kelling, professor of criminology at Northeastern University.<sup>4</sup>  Moreover, many other innovative local officials are enjoying successes similar to New York City's. "Police can reduce crime now, within constraints. They needn't wait for new cars or computers, more cops, bigger budget or more overtime," says Professor Kelling.<sup>5</sup>  More than anything else, local police need solid personnel management and a clear mission to combat crime and disorder, with serious backup from the public, the politicians, and the press. Bratton's stunning success in New York City is largely attributable to his progressive vision of what the police can do to control crime.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The gains made by New York and other cities in fighting crime have not been achieved by accident. They have happened because innovative police officials have learned the lessons of experience and used them to improve policing. Among the lessons and actions taken:<ul>
<p><li>
<b>Police should target urban America's "hot spots" and career criminals.</b> Successful police departments focus on the decaying and disordered spaces where most of the nation's serious crime takes place. Research shows that more than half of all serious crime is concentrated in less than 3 percent of the addresses in an urban area. They also target urban America's tiny criminal class: the 6 percent of the male population responsible for about 50 percent of serious crime.
<p><li>
<b>Good policing requires high recruitment standards.</b> While Americans want the best police protection, too many metropolitan areas around the United States have witnessed a deliberate -- often politically motivated -- lowering of intellectual, physical, and character standards within the police force. Failure to maintain standards leads to a loss of ,lan among police officers themselves. Poor personnel practices result in bad, brutal, or incompetent police officers and a lowering of public confidence.
<p><li>
<b>Police should be on the beat, not behind a desk.</b> Instead of keeping order and enforcing the law, too many police officers are patrolling ineffectively or being employed in ancillary functions that could be performed just as easily by civilians or private agencies. These managerial and political decisions compromise the integrity and effectiveness of local law enforcement.
</ul><P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Local officials can learn from the experience of the growing number of cities and localities that have strengthened their police forces through their own efforts. These localities have improved personnel management, including direct accountability for police performance, while also employing the most effective strategies and the most sophisticated technical and information systems to track, prevent, and combat violent crime. Without waiting for official Washington, local officials can take decisive steps to improve their own police departments. These steps include<ul>

<p><li><b>Upgrading</b> recruitment and training standards;

<p><li><b>Aggressively recruiting</b> police officers from the ranks of the military (which would expand the number of well-qualified black and minority applicants);

<p><li><b>Improving</b> the techniques used to detect and prevent crime;

<p><li><b>Targeting</b> the small number of criminals responsible for most of the serious crime;

<p><li><b>Focusing</b> on urban "hot spots" where crime flourishes;

<p><li><b>Making</b> salaries commensurate with responsibilities and performance;

<p><li><b>Privatizing</b> and civilianizing non-police administrative functions;

<p><li><b>Promoting</b> community policing; and

<p><li><b>Demanding</b> direct accountability of police commanders in the field. 
</ul>
<p>
<b>Support from the State and Courts</b><P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 
Even with excellent police work, violent criminals typically serve only a portion of their sentences, often as little as one-third.<sup>6</sup>  The tireless work of police officers and detectives often seems to be in vain, as repeat violent offenders are released from prison after spending minimal time behind bars. To back up the police, legislatures and courts must act to keep violent criminals and other perpetrators of serious crimes off the streets. Among the remedial measures needed are the reform of parole and probation systems and the adoption of truth in sentencing laws to make sure that violent criminals serve at least 85 percent of their sentences.<sup>7</sup>  Police officers have a personal interest in such policies: Between 1988 and 1992, 20 percent of all persons arrested for killing law enforcement officers were on probation or parole at the time of the offense.<sup>8</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress also can support America's local police, but not in the ways that often characterize action in Washington. In response to the continuing escalation of violent crime, the 103rd Congress, with the support of President Clinton, enacted the Violent Crime Control Act of 1994. The promise: 100,000 additional police officers on neighborhood streets.<sup>9</sup>  But thus far, the program has meant little more than 17,000 additional police on the streets. Worse, the Administration's funding allocation does not target localities hardest hit by violent crime, and many local governments are finding it difficult to bear the required financial burden of the matching formula.<sup>10</sup> 
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress could be far more helpful by:
<ul>
<p><li><b>Providing more flexible federal funding for local law enforcement, such as federal tax rebates to states for use in combating violent crime.</b> This would enable local officials to tailor financing to those aspects of law enforcement that best meet the needs of their communities. Alternatively, Congress could make $10 billion in block grants available to local police agencies over a period of five years to target the areas hardest hit by violent crime, as proposed by Representative Bill McCollum (R-FL).

<p><li><b>Reforming criminal procedure.</b> This means such things as enacting reform of the so-called exclusionary rule, which passed the House of Representatives earlier this year, to allow a good faith exception in the gathering of evidence during criminal investigations. Hearings on the impact of the <I>Miranda</I> rule governing the taking of statements from suspects doubtless would prove enlightening and might build support for reasonable changes. In exercising their confirmation responsibilities with regard to the appointment of federal judges, Senators also could and should block the appointment of any candidate with a record of demonstrated insensitivity to public safety. Congress recently achieved a long-overdue reform by putting a stop to the judicial imposition of prison caps on state and local prisons. These court-imposed caps have been putting violent felons back on America's streets.<sup>11</sup>  Police officers and crime victims alike have been frustrated and demoralized by such liberal judicial policies. 

<p><li><b>Improving the social environment by replacing failed federal urban policies with a new neighborhood empowerment strategy.</b> Inner-city communities can be renewed through genuine enterprise zones. Scholarships and vouchers can help poor children escape crime-ridden schools and attend the schools of their choice, including religious schools that respect parental responsibility, reinforce the moral teachings of their parents, and promote civilized conduct. Federal policies can encourage effective neighborhood social service agencies, including faith-based drug treatment and counseling activities, to improve the social climate. Strong community-based organizations, working closely with the police, also can help prevent crime. Representatives J. C. Watts (R-OK) and James Talent (R-MO) are sponsoring comprehensive legislation, Saving Our Children: The American Community Renewal Act of 1996 (H.R. 3467), to accomplish these goals.<sup>12</sup>
</ul><p>
 
<b>BACK TO BASICS: WHY PUBLIC OFFICIALS NEED TO RETHINK THE ROLE OF THE POLICE</b>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Local police are invested with awesome public authority, yet they often lack the public respect or official understanding that their specific duties should command.<sup>13</sup>  They are expected to make instantaneous and complex decisions, to put themselves in danger, and to act calmly in the most terrifying circumstances, yet they are often underpaid and lack the status of other public officials in much less demanding occupations. Many police officers find this combination of demands and pressures demoralizing.14 <P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The inherent problem of police work is that the law often specifies what the police officer cannot do; it does not tell him what he should do.<sup>15</sup>  In virtually every public or private institution, the discretion available to a person is directly proportional to his rise in the hierarchy. Those at the top have the most discretion, while those at the bottom have the least. But discretion in the exercise of police authority increases as one goes <I>down</I> the hierarchy.<sup>16</sup>  Whether working alone or with a partner, the police officer usually is not subject to any immediate supervision, and his judgments under pressure are subjected to constant analysis and second-guessing by the public and the courts.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

As former New York City Police Commissioner Patrick Murphy has noted, the ideal police officer is in tune with the community and able to spot a likely problem before the fact, not just respond after the fact to something that already has become a local tragedy.<sup>17</sup>  Ideally, under circumstances less threatening than a life-or-death situation, a police officer functions best as a "streetcorner politician," peacefully settling disputes and using his social skills to assuage potential combatants and maintain order.<sup>18</sup>  Thus, the special challenge for local officials is to make sure that the recruit is a person of "quiet confidence" who can take control of a situation without identifying criminal resistance to established public authority as some sort of personal slight.<sup>19</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This constant need to exercise prudential judgment illuminates yet another paradox of police work. Police management is likely to give a cop "credit" for an arrest, and yet the resort to an arrest may very well represent a genuine failure to keep order. If a neighborhood dispute is resolved carefully, the police intervention is an unrecorded success.<sup>20</sup>  But if the officer fails to defuse the situation, and there is a crime leading to an arrest and prosecution, the cop who lets the situation deteriorate gets "credit" for the arrest.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

For state and local officials, the heart of police reform is personnel management.<sup>21</sup>  The higher educational achievements of officers recruited during the 1940s contributed to the "professionalization" of the police from the 1950s on, and generally produced tougher standards in recruiting urban police officers. In New York City, for example, standardized tests, including IQ tests, were common during the 1950s and 1960s, and the performance of recruits in the Police Academy invariably was above the average for the population generally. As Arthur Niederhoff, a veteran officer and authority on the New York City Police Department, has reported, any recruit with an IQ below the normal range had only a small chance of being recruited either by the NYPD or by other major police departments.<sup>22</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

During the 1950s and 1960s, the New York City Police Department also undertook rigorous background investigations into the character, reputation, and medical and psychological histories of recruits. Approximately 50 percent of the applicants who passed the examinations eventually were eliminated.<sup>23</sup>  The rule was simple: Any doubt concerning an applicant's fitness for appointment was to be resolved in "favor of the department."<sup>24</sup>  The rules governing retention on the force were likewise rigorous: Officers were expected to refrain from any behavior (including immoral personal behavior) "that would tend to bring adverse criticism of the department."<sup>25</sup>  During the 1950s and early 1960s, the rate of acceptance in the NYPD was only 15 percent.<sup>26</sup>  In Tucson, Arizona, the acceptance rate during the same period was 6 percent; and in Los Angeles, California, the acceptance rate from 1950-1962 was only 4 percent.<sup>27</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

With the recent trend in many cities back to community policing, the job requirements are likely to be even stiffer. One recent study of the competencies essential in "a community policing environment" concludes that "skills in effective verbal communication, listening and demonstration of empathy or understanding in a multicultural society are extremely essential. The ability to identify problems, make commitments, understand the reality of the police impact on crime, analyze situations, demonstrate persistence, employ situational strategies, and recognize solutions to problems are also extremely essential competencies."<sup>28</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In recent years, the working conditions for patrol officers have become tougher. As police departments have become more specialized and bureaucratic, officers have been moved from the street to staff jobs even as crime rates and the workload of patrol officers have increased. The result: "Odd hours, overtime, and off-duty court appearances, not to mention the most dangerous job in the organization, [have made] patrol work the least desirable policing assignment. Ironically, like the classroom teacher and the ward nurse, it is the lowest paid and least respected part of the operation."<sup>29</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Local officials should be aware that demoralization is a serious and recurrent occupational hazard among police officers. In urban areas, the social and economic elites have largely abandoned the central cities, and inner-city communities themselves are often crime-ridden. Big-city police often feel they are fighting a losing battle against overwhelming odds. Far too many of the persons they arrest for violent crimes are out on probation, parole, or pre-trial release.

<p>
<b>Undercut by Lawyers and Judges</b><P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 
Police also are frustrated with lenient judges and frequent plea bargaining arrangements. In 1993, for example, 90 percent of the 200,000 felony convictions in the United States were plea bargained.<sup>30</sup>  In one survey, 60 percent of police officers felt that criminal plea bargaining was "unfair to the arresting officer."<sup>31</sup>  Such frustration and cynicism, compounded by poor personnel management, fuel police demoralization. They also contribute to what is known as "the cop culture," the fraternal secrecy and mutual self-defense network thrown up to protect good and bad cops alike. Not surprisingly, studies also indicate that the suicide rate among police officers is more than twice that of the general population.<sup>32</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Americans strongly support putting more police on the streets.<sup>33</sup>  The popular assumption is that increasing the number of police will decrease crime rates, but the quantity of police does not make up for poor management of police or poor working conditions. In 1992, for instance, Washington, D.C.'s homicide rate was six times higher, and its overall serious crime rate two times higher, than San Diego's. Yet Washington had five times as many police officers per capita as San Diego. Moreover, in 1989, when Washington increased its overall police force by 19 percent under congressional mandate, serious violent crime actually rose by 15 percent, and homicide jumped 9 percent over a period of one year.<sup>34</sup>  Between 1952 and 1978, total police personnel in the United States rose from 254,000 to 689,000, an increase of 171 percent; between 1957 and 1978, incidents of reported crime rose from 1,422,000 to 11,141,3000, an increase of 657 percent.<sup>35</sup>  Overall, "More than a dozen major empirical studies over the last two decades have failed to demonstrate either that police manpower and crime rates vary inversely or that particular types of community-oriented policing practices prevent crime."<sup>36</sup>  Declares Dr. Gregory Berg, a veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department, "We know that the number of police on the street and police methods in general have little effect on crime rates."<sup>37</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Fortunately, imaginative public policy is running ahead of public policy research. In New York City and elsewhere, innovative policing is having a measurable impact on crime -- again, not because of the numbers or mere presence of the police, but because of what the police are doing. With the evolution of modern information systems and the application of improved strategic thinking on the part of police managers, much more fruitful research is possible.<sup>38</sup> Local officials can adopt strong empirical measures of police performance. But success rests ultimately on the intangibles: Courage and character, sound judgment, a solid knowledge of law and procedure, and an ability to apply them in ambiguous, often dangerous and difficult situations. Officials must realize that these qualities are essential in any person who is given broad discretion, armed with a deadly weapon, and pledged to serve and protect the citizens of the community.

Approximately 80 percent of the urban police officer's job is "restoring order."<sup>39</sup>  In practice, this means coping with such relatively minor things as drunken and disorderly conduct, loud noise in the neighborhood, fights and scuffles, or bar-room brawls. It is also the main interest of the public: "In focus groups, community meetings and surveys, citizens regularly report the biggest safety concerns to be things like panhandling, obstreperous youth taking over parks or street corners, public drinking, prostitution and other disorderly behavior. Such concerns cross class, race, and ethnic boundaries, and occur in all areas of the country."<sup>40</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In any given circumstance, restoring order involves intervening and settling a "dispute" about what is "right" or "seemly."<sup>41</sup>  Thus, the situation is governed not only by law, but by the social circumstances and prevailing "subculture" of the neighborhood or community. Indeed, custom is often more important than law in "street situations."<sup>42</sup>  While these incidents may appear to be minor, they can be dangerous, for they often involve personal "honor and dishonor."  Despite its importance to the public, police are often "defensive" in keeping order. They recognize that they are dealing, at least initially, with minor offenses or " misdemeanors" which are unlikely to result in jail or even significant fines. This means that the entire process of arrest, booking, and preliminary hearings is, in most instances, a waste of limited and valuable time; "[t]he most important consequence of this state of affairs is that with respect to routine police matters, the normal tendency of the police is to underenforce the law."<sup>43</sup> 
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The best guide to making an arrest in such cases is the police officer's own experience and judgment, combined with a strong working knowledge of the law. A notorious neighborhood troublemaker, well-known to the police, for example, invariably is a good candidate for arrest and is worth the personal investment in the time and paperwork the arrest entails. Nevertheless, the police officer knows that very few of his arrests are likely to result in prosecution; for every 56 persons arrested by the police, only 1 goes to prison.<sup>44</sup>  Most of those arrested are released within 12 hours.<sup>45</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Nowhere is deciding whether to arrest a suspect more difficult than in cases of domestic violence. In 1984, for example, a controlled experiment in Minneapolis found that male batterers arrested by the police were largely deterred by these arrests which were "more effective" than "peacekeeping strategies."<sup>46</sup>  Further analysis revealed, however, that while this strategy worked if the male batterer was employed, the arrest of batterers who were unemployed led to increased violence toward their partners.<sup>47</sup>  State and local officials must be mindful of the trade-off between arrest and police presence on the street, especially in view of the fact that "[t]he deterrent effects of an arrest and of patrol presence on the streets have never been compared."<sup>48</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The effectiveness of the police in maintaining order and quelling disorder has a broad impact on the prevention or reduction of more serious crime. "For decades," however, "most big city police departments have devoted little effort to combatting disorder. By allowing an accumulation of small infractions, this neglect creates an environment that generates big infractions."<sup>49</sup> 
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Disorder is highest in neighborhoods characterized not only by loss of economic vitality, but also by social instability: broken families, fatherless children, and physically and sexually abusive criminal adults, the ultimate source of crime.<sup>50</sup>  Broken windows, graffiti, drunken and disorderly conduct, prostitution, and the like all say to the small criminal population responsible for most serious urban crime that members of the community are indifferent to the conditions around them and do not care enough to call the police to stop the disorder in their midst.<sup>51</sup>  These disordered territories become "hot spots," geographical areas open to illegal business and more serious crime such as the sale of crack cocaine, which is strongly associated with rises in violent crime. Moreover, most violent crime is the deadly work of a criminal class comprised largely of males aged 15 to 24 from broken families, with low cognitive abilities (particularly low verbal skills) and a history of anti-social behavior and multiple arrests: "The 5 to 7 percent of the population falling into the category of habitual offenders is responsible for no less than half of all arrests or police contacts."  <sup>52</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This spatial concentration has profound implications for effective urban policing: "Spreading more police out across a big city and lowering response time, the research shows, will have little effect on crime -- no matter what neighborhood groups think. But more police attacking the risk factors for crime -- like guns on the street in 'hot spots' street corners -- could make a substantial difference in crime."<sup>53</sup>  This is especially true of gun crime. Of the approximately 200 million guns in the United States, one-third are handguns; and about 2 percent of these handguns are used to commit crimes.<sup>54</sup>  Therefore, "Concentration of police crime prevention in places with the highest gun crime may be the most effective way to protect everyone, not just residents of the high crime locations."<sup>55</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton made the concerted attack on neighborhood disorder a top priority, combining modern management techniques with an older tradition of policing based on a perceived relationship between neighborhood disorder and serious crime. Bratton's "Police Strategy No. 5," for example, declares that "By working systematically and assertively to reduce the level of disorder in the City, the NYPD will act to undercut the ground on which more serious crimes seem possible and even permissible"<sup>56</sup> This neighborhood-based strategy involves an all-out attack on the components of neighborhood disorder, including prostitution, liquor sales to minors, and violations of noise ordinances, as well as felonies. Violators are cited, and persistent violators are arrested; moreover, these arrests are accompanied by probing police interrogations by officers looking for leads to more serious criminal activities, especially gun-related crimes. When Commissioner Bratton headed the New York City Transit Police, his aggressive methods re-established order on New York's subway systems, long a notorious crime "hot spot;" felonies in that system declined 75 percent in four years.<sup>57</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Bratton's success in New York City is mirrored to a lesser extent in other metropolitan areas in which police have combined this aggressive neighborhood-based strategy with innovative community policing techniques. Atlantic City, New Jersey, and Sarasota, Florida, for example, are bringing police officers and their families back into troubled neighborhoods through low-interest home loans. Not only do the police live where they work, but the program also sends a positive message to law-abiding residents in these neighborhoods that the police are there to protect them. Chief Charles Austin of Columbia, South Carolina, says that the city's home loan program has contributed to a 16 percent decrease in crime.<sup>58</sup>  Similarly innovative community police programs can be found in cities throughout the United States, including Lowell, Massachusetts; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Austin, Texas; Charlotte, North Carolina; Indianapolis, Indiana; Milwaukee, Wisconsin; and San Diego, California. 
<P>


<b>Enforcing the Law</b><P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 
For the officer on the street, enforcing the law or stopping the commission of a serious crime is more clear-cut than settling a dispute over what constitutes "disorderly" behavior. In practice, however, it is difficult to combat serious crime either by preventing it or by arresting the perpetrator after the fact. Police responding immediately to a case make an arrest in only 2.9 percent of all calls involving serious crimes.<sup>59</sup>  Only 25 percent of all calls to the police in cases of serious crime involve actual contact between the victim and the offender; 75 percent of all serious crimes are reported after the fact.<sup>60</sup>  And, as noted previously, almost half of America's violent crime is never even reported to the police.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Once the initial report is taken, the task of resolving serious crimes usually is reserved to the detectives, whose work requires the ability to ask the right questions, a sound capacity for deductive reasoning, and a keen sense of human nature. In most major metropolitan departments, regardless of the social changes that have taken place over many years, detectives are viewed as the professional elite of the police force.<sup>61</sup>  On the face of it, their work is daunting. They must identify, locate, and arrest the suspect and then prepare a careful report of the criminal investigation, replete with all the pertinent facts of the case. This is the crucial body of information to be used by the prosecution both in determining the charge and ultimately in proving its case in court. The detective must prepare for his own testimony and cross examination as a key state witness at the preliminary hearing and at the trial itself, seeing the case through to its ultimate resolution.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Since the 1960s, this job has been complicated by a series of U.S. Supreme Court rulings that, in effect, have federalized state criminal procedure, including the rules of evidence, contrary to the spirit of the Constitution and the original intent of the Framers. For example, in <I>Mapp v. Ohio</I> (1961), the Court mandated the exclusion of evidence in cases involving even the most technical violation of the search and seizure provisions of the Fourth Amendment. In <I>Miranda v. Arizona</I> (1966), the Court held that a person held as a suspect in a criminal case must be informed of his right to remain silent and to have his lawyer with him during the interrogation.<sup>62</sup>  Again, the penalty for even a minor police mistake was exclusion of any statement made by the suspect. <I>Miranda</I> in particular was met with a storm of protest from local police officials, who argued that it would handcuff their investigative work. Congress responded by enacting a provision in the Crime Control Act of 1968 which allowed a judge, after looking at the totality of circumstances surrounding a confession in a federal case and finding that the confession was given to the law enforcement officers voluntarily, to admit the evidence even though not all of the procedural requirements specified in <I>Miranda</I> had been met. This provision has been all but unused by the U.S. Department of Justice.<sup>63</sup> 
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Given this situation, the detective obviously must be sensitive to the fine points of criminal procedure, since defense attorneys may be expected to seize upon the slightest error. Rigorous selection and training of detectives therefore must be among the most important personnel management priorities in any police department. Because uniformed patrolmen constitute the pool from which future detectives will be drawn, state and local officials must pay close attention to the entrance standards for police recruiting and staffing as well.<sup>64</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The most common measurement of law enforcement success is the clearance rate. Technically, a "cleared" case is one in which a person has been arrested, charged with a crime, and turned over to prosecutors. Clearance rates for violent crimes known to the police have been declining for over two decades. In 1972, the clearance rate for reported violent criminal offenses was 48.8 percent. By 1993, it was 42.5 percent.<sup>65</sup>  In some of America's largest cities, including Chicago, Detroit, and San Francisco, according to 1994 FBI statistics, clearance rates for violent crime run as low as 20.7 to 38 percent.<sup>66</sup>  Over the past 30 years, the clearance rate for homicide nationwide has declined by 25 percent, and the ability of police to close cases of forcible rape has declined by 20 percent.<sup>67</sup>  Clearance rates for 1994, the most recent year for which figures are available, ranged from 64 percent in murder cases to 24 percent for robberies and as low as 13 percent for burglaries and 14 percent for motor vehicle thefts.<sup>68</sup>  Thus, a great many of the most serious crimes are never solved.
<p>

<b>Police and Community</b><P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Walking "the beat" used to be the model for urban policing. Officers got to know the residents of the community, and the residents of the community got to know them. This made it relatively easy to maintain order and enhanced the ability of the police to fight crime. Direct or anonymous tips, a well-grounded experience with local troublemakers, a keen sense of the local powers present in the neighborhood, including the very worst influences, all gave police officers quick and often easy access to solid information that could serve as the basis for further questioning and the apprehension of criminals.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Over the past four decades, two developments changed the widespread use of this traditional model. The first was internal: a change in the style and philosophy of urban policing itself. Police officials determined that officers cruising urban or suburban areas in patrol cars would be in a better position to respond to calls for help or assistance. Aside from the speed and mobility of the well-equipped patrol car itself, the practice of using police cars in regular patrols created higher visibility over a larger geographical area. This, it was thought, would better deter crime and make the police, equipped with radios and other equipment, more effective in combatting it.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The second development was external: the dramatic social and cultural changes within the communities themselves. The legal revolution in civil rights and the racial conflict and social tension of the 1960s and 1970s left a legacy of hostility to the police that persists in certain neighborhoods to this day. While urban police in the 1960s and 1970s, particularly in large cities, were overwhelmingly white and came from working-class or middle-class backgrounds, they often were policing non-white neighborhoods. This presented new challenges. "The problems created by the exercise of the necessary discretion," as Professor James Q. Wilson has written, "are least in communities that have widely shared values as to what constitutes an appropriate level of order and what kind of person or form of behavior is an empirically sound predictor of criminal intention; the problems are greatest in cities deeply divided along lines of class and race."<sup>69</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Since the 1960s, police officers have found themselves responding in different ways to different communities. Disorder in some neighborhoods may lead to little or no intervention by the police, while similar problems in other neighborhoods may cause an entirely different response.<sup>70</sup>  The unspoken assumption is that "Various neighborhoods and subcultures have their own levels of tolerable disorder; what may appear to be weaker norms are only different norms."<sup>71</sup>  Too often, laboring under real or imagined suspicions of racial bigotry, the police have simply given up trying to quell disorder in many minority communities, thus tacitly accepting the academically fashionable premises of cultural and moral relativism and its tragic consequences.<sup>72</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This problem is aggravated by conflicting ideological pressures, particularly among black liberals and leftists, over the appropriate response to crime and disorder in black communities. Paul Butler, a professor of law at George Washington University and former D.C. prosecutor, argues that black jurors should acquit non-violent black criminals, including drug dealers and burglars, even if they are clearly guilty, precisely because they are black and victims of a racist social order.<sup>73</sup>  At the same time, however, in reacting against laws against disorder used by the police in the past as "tools of subjugation" to harass black males, many black citizens in the District of Columbia now find themselves vulnerable to levels of disorder that are not tolerated in middle-class white suburbs.<sup>74</sup>  Says Professor John DiIulio: "You can't have it both ways -- protesting that police are less responsive to black crime victims than white ones in one breath, charging that too many black victimizers get caught, convicted and sentenced in the next; spinning out conspiratorial theories of white acquiescence in letting drugs flow into black communities in the morning, complaining that efforts to crack down on the drug trade are motivated by racism in the afternoon."<sup>75</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Popular reactions to the Rodney King episode and the O. J. Simpson trial highlight the deep racial divisions in Americans' attitudes toward the police. Blacks are more likely than whites to complain about the behavior of police. Surveys also indicate that 49 percent of blacks, but only 22 percent of whites, believe whites get better treatment before the courts and at the hands of police.<sup>76</sup>  Moreover, while 50 percent of whites believe that the police and the courts treat blacks and whites equally, only 29 percent of blacks believe this to be true.<sup>77</sup>  The data on police brutality,<sup>78</sup> however, indicate that such incidents have not been widespread in recent years. According to Robert E. Worden, Assistant Professor of Criminal Justice at the State University of New York at Albany, "The incidence of the use of improper force is rare in the sense that aircraft fatalities are rare; it is infrequent relative to the large volume of interaction between police and citizens, just as deaths in aircraft accidents are infrequent relative to the large number of passenger miles flown."<sup>79</sup>  When these incidents do occur, they are associated with a variety of factors and, at least historically, more often than not are aggravated by class rather than racial differences.<sup>80</sup>

<b>PROTECTING MINORITY COMMUNITIES</b>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Many black leaders, both liberal and conservative, argue that the real problem is the absence of police in neighborhoods that are perceived by the officers as "dangerous."  The predominant fear is not of the police, but that the police will abandon the community to criminal predators, some of them mercenary agents of organized crime or drug cartels. "Why doesn't America keep the peace in inner cities?"  ask Glenn C. Loury, Professor of Economics at Boston University, and Shelby Steele, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution. "Suppose there were several hundred gang-related murders every year in suburban Chicago or Washington or Los Angeles. Would there be a different public response?"<sup>81</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Young black males are far more likely to be victimized by violent crime than any other segment of America's population. A solid majority of blacks in one survey (57 percent) agreed that there were places in their areas "where they were afraid to walk alone at night."<sup>82</sup>  In a 1994 survey, more than 60 percent of blacks and whites agreed that government was spending "too little" on law enforcement.<sup>83</sup>  The misgivings of Loury and Steele echo the earlier complaints of the late Dr. Martin Luther King: "Permissive crime in ghettos is the nightmare of the slum family. Permissive crime is the name for the organized crime that flourishes in the ghetto -- designed, directed and cultivated by white national crime syndicates operating numbers, narcotics, and prostitution rackets freely in the protected sanctuaries of the ghettos."<sup>84</sup>  The color and ethnic composition of the predators may have changed, but for inner-city residents, the nightmare continues.
<p>

<b>LOWERING STANDARDS: <br>
THE HIGH PRICE OF POLITICAL CORRECTNESS</b><P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Minority group spokesmen claim, often with justification, that they are "underrepresented" in the staffing of police departments. Police officers must understand the local people and their culture and mores. Neighborhood perceptions of insensitivity or a lack of diversity among police personnel can have a negative impact on police-community relations.<sup>85</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To cope with these social realities, beginning in earnest in the late 1960s, state and local officials attempted to break down long-standing barriers to the hiring of minorities in metropolitan police forces. Federal laws and regulations, particularly those issued by the Nixon Administration, reinforced these efforts. Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, no person may be discriminated against or deprived of an opportunity for public service on the grounds of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin; the processes of recruitment, selection, training, and promotion are supposed to be "color-blind" so that all persons are given an equal opportunity. As a result of this combination of changing "social norms" and "the end of overt discrimination," blacks in particular made substantial gains: "Between 1970 and 1990, for example, the number of black police rose from 23,796 to 63,855; they constituted 41 percent of new hires."<sup>86</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

But as the effort to increase diversity accelerated, liberal politicians and judges too often departed from the sound principle that individuals should never be rewarded or penalized on the basis of race or sex. To employ more minorities and women, police agencies frequently have adopted systems of quotas and preferences at the expense of quality, causing standards to be lowered and personnel decisions no longer to be based on selecting the most highly qualified candidates, especially in large metropolitan urban areas.<sup>87</sup> 
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In 1966, for example, using federal funds under the Manpower Development Training Act, one of many liberal job training programs enacted during the 1960s, New York City officials planned to train 1,000 black and Puerto Rican youths to become policemen through a "Cadet Program."  Whatever the intended benefits of this program, it was a blow to the cause of professionalism within the NYPD, which had sought to attract new recruits who possessed college degrees, because it concentrated on enrolling "minority group drop-outs" to staff the city's police force.<sup>88</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Quotas are both logically incompatible with personnel management based on the principle of merit selection and a departure from the liberal tradition. In the words of the late Justice William O. Douglas, one of the most prominent champions of liberal views on the U.S. Supreme Court, "Minorities in our midst who are to serve actively in our public affairs should be chosen on talent and character alone, not on cultural orientation or leanings."<sup>89</sup>  The irony is that "Cities as a whole suffer from bad police diversity policies, but it is crime ridden minority communities in them that suffer the most."<sup>90</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Various metropolitan governments have deliberately lowered standards for the recruitment and hiring of police officers in recent years. During the early 1990s, for example, the rush to racial and ethnic "diversity" on the New York City police force resulted in the hiring of officers with low test scores and inadequate background investigations. City officials examining police corruption, including officers compromised by notorious drug dealers, argued that the problem was the "institutional culture" of the department. But the lowering of standards clearly contributed to the problem: "True enough, most bad cops have been white, but a disproportionate number of cops indicted in New York have been minority officers hired in recent years to make the city's force more reflective of its demographics."<sup>91</sup>  In other major cities, whether because of "rush hiring" or quotas, the consequences, both in terms of public safety and in terms of public confidence in the hiring process, have been equally alarming.
<blockquote>
	<b>Washington D.C.:</b> Between 1989 and 1990, under congressional authorization, Washington hired 1,500 police officers. As part of this effort, city officials deliberately reduced hiring standards: "Critical background checks on applicants were cut short, and investigators scrimped on visits to neighborhoods and interviews with former employers. Physical examinations were hurried, and some people who failed to meet minimum requirements were hired anyway. The psychological services unit, which had rejected one in five applicants in other years, rejected just one in 20."<sup>92</sup>
<p>
	Since 1989, 201 D.C. police officers have been arrested (some more than once) by their colleagues on charges ranging from drug dealing and shoplifting to rape and murder. Reporters from <I>The Washington Post</I> learned that the department kept a list of 185 police officers with criminal problems so severe that prosecutors could not put them on the witness stand to testify in criminal cases. And a number of the new police officers that they did put on the stand made such poor witnesses that they often injured the prosecution's case. Because of just one narcotics detective who tested positive for cocaine, the U.S. attorney was forced to seek the release of 32 prisoners convicted on the officer's testimony and the dismissal of 88 cases in which the detective was the key witness for the prosecution.<sup>93</sup>  ABC News correspondent Robert Zelnick has noted that "The police department of the nation's Capital has a notorious record of seeing felony charges dismissed because of police incompetence in filling out arrest reports and related records."<sup>94</sup>
<p>
	A D.C. Metropolitan Police training director found that many recruits had tested so low in reading comprehension tests that they needed "remedial classes."  District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry put a stop to such classes because, said the director, he "feared the classes would reflect poorly on D.C. public schools from which many of the recruits had graduated."<sup>94</sup>  As summed up by Edwin J. Delattre, Professor of Education and Philosophy at Boston University, "The part that Congress and top elected officials in the city government have played in this debacle is a disgrace."
<p>
Because of Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) racial, ethnic, and gender "diversity" guidelines, D.C. officials have eliminated any meaningful standards for passing grades on te written examinations for police promotions. Candidates for police promotions now can receive "passing grades" merely by answering correctly "less than half" of the questions on the written examination, which costs taxpayers $1 million to administer.<sup>95</sup> Local officials defend this policy by claiming that certain officers do not test well, that tests are not the best indicator of which candidates would make good police officers, and that results in any case must reflect departmental diversity. But such excuses ignore practical reality. In the words of a police official who asked not to be identified for "fear of retribution," the fact remains that "You're talking about guys who can't get half the answers right. I just don't know how a street officer would feel taking orders from a supervisor who can't get half the answers right."<sup>96</sup> 
<p>
	<b>Miami, Florida:</b> In 1980, the city of Miami quickly hired 200 new policemen, with the specification that 80 percent were to be from the city's minority communities. Throughout the orientation and background investigation process, city officials were warned of the deficiencies of this class of future Miami police officers. The results proved disastrous. By 1988, more than a third of the class hired in 1980 were fired; 75 percent of Miami police officers accused of wrongdoing turned out to be members of this class; and 10 ended up pleading guilty to crimes as serious as murder and drug trafficking. "The frenzy of indiscriminate hiring, inadequate training, and poor supervision eroded personnel standards of the Miami Police Department until even illiteracy was no disqualification."<sup>97</sup>
<p>
	<b>Chicago, Illinois:</b> After promising to base police personnel decisions on merit, Mayor Richard J. Daley, Jr., recently reversed himself and determined that the city would use race as a consideration in promoting senior members of the police department. This would allow police officials to promote black and Hispanic candidates above white candidates who scored higher. In 1994, Mayor Daley authorized merit tests for police promotions, and the taxpayers of Chicago paid $5 million to have an outside company develop and administer these tests. Of the top 114 test scores, only 5 were achieved by minority candidates. Daley's decision has angered and demoralized members of the police force. "They told us it was all about merit," remarked William Nolan, President of the local chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police. "Now we hear it's not about merit, but about politics and race. So, the police force doesn't believe him anymore."<sup>98</sup>
<p>
	<b>Boston, Massachusetts:</b> Bypassing merit testing for appointment to the police force, the city of Boston has entered into a court-ordered consent decree mandating "diversity" in the ranks. While 42 percent of the residents of Boston are members of minority groups, the police department is 26.4 percent minority. The purpose of the new judicially imposed policy is to reduce the racial imbalance and make up for past "exclusion" by elevating minorities over white candidates taking the police examinations. In 1990, nearly 75 percent of white candidates who took the test scored 90 or above, compared to 36 percent of minorities; 11.4 percent of the white candidates scored 98, 99, or 100, compared to 2.9 percent of minorities. Liberal critics claim the police test is inherently discriminatory, and therefore a poor indicator of how a policeman will perform on the job. According to James Kelly, President of the Boston City Council, however, "There were whites who scored 100 on the tests, but they are not Boston police officers for one reason: the color of their skin. What we have now is a quota system."<sup>99</sup>

Poor personnel management has created serious problems in other major metropolitan areas as well. For example, the Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Police Department has been ripped by devastating charges of police corruption, and numerous convictions, including convictions in major drug cases, have been overturned because of falsified police reports, illegal tactics, and perjury on the part of police officers.<sup>100</sup>  In New Orleans, Louisiana, 50 police officers have been arrested, indicted, or convicted on criminal charges ranging from murder to drug-trafficking since 1993.<sup>101</sup>  In Baltimore, Maryland, the failure to retain experienced detectives with top-level investigative skills is compromising the quality of police investigations and hampering the efforts of prosecutors. "In court, it is a loss of an experienced detective who can explain to a jury how you go through an investigation," observes U.S. Attorney Katherine J. Armentout. "They have credibility with a jury that is just invaluable."<sup>102</sup>

<b>THE CLINTON "COPS" PROGRAM</b><P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

With the enactment of the $30 billion Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, President Clinton promised to put 100,000 additional police officers on America's streets to fight violent crime. Among its many provisions, the 1994 law sets aside $8.8 billion in funding for the hiring of police officers over a six-year period. Clinton's Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Program, administered by a new office within the Department of Justice, gives funds to local jurisdictions, including smaller towns and larger urban areas, for "community policing" strategies.<sup>103</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Under this, grants fund local police personnel for three years, and the federal contribution is set at 75 percent of the combined salary and benefits of each officer, up to $75,000 over a three-year period. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, average starting salaries for entry level police officers today range from $18,710 to $26,560, with "average operating expenditures" for each officer ranging from $31,500 to $63,400 per annum.<sup>104</sup>  In 1995, 8,000 of the nation's approximately 15,000 law enforcement jurisdictions applied for the new federal funding; 92 percent of those which applied were approved.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

There has been some confusion over the exact number of police officers hired thus far under the Clinton plan. While the 100,000 figure is used routinely in the media, Attorney General Janet Reno recently cited a far smaller number of police on the streets as a result of the new grant program: 17,000.<sup>105</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Clinton Administration's promise of 100,000 additional police is popular with local officials who can afford the matching contribution. But even if the promise were fulfilled, "the nation would go from having one officer on patrol at any given time for every 6,250 Americans (1.6 per 10,000) to one officer for every 5,208 Americans (1.9 per 10,000).... This 20 percent increase does not seem likely to make much difference in crime, at least under conventional theories of high visibility and rapid response time. Nor is it likely to produce the substantially higher arrest rates that some advocates argue will reduce crime."<sup>106</sup>  In addition, reported crime has been declining since 1992,<sup>107</sup> well before passage of the 1994 crime bill and well before the first cohort of newly funded officers hit the streets.

The available evidence clearly indicates that the Clinton program is poorly targeted to reduce violent crime.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In a random sample of applicants conducted by the U.S. General Accounting Office, for example, 84 percent of the jurisdictions cited "property" crimes as among their "top five ranked public safety issues," followed by domestic violence (78.3 percent); alcohol-related crimes, including drunken driving (63.3 percent); drug crimes (60.9 percent); and vandalism (51.2 percent). "Violent crimes against persons" ranked only sixth (50.7 percent).<sup>108</sup>  Other "top five public safety issues" included traffic violations (3.7 percent), disorderly conduct (19.8 percent), and gangs (19.3 percent). Overall, the GAO "found no relationship between crime rates and whether an applicant jurisdiction was awarded the grant."<sup>109</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

$7.2 million in COPS grant money ended up funding 86 police officers for state parks, including 30 additional officers in Florida to "keep watch over a coral sanctuary" and 19 park rangers for the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.<sup>110</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Based on an extrapolation from the GAO data, the Subcommittee on Crime of the House Judiciary Committee found that grant funding was not going to those cities and communities hardest hit by violent crime. In Oregon, for example, Portland accounts for 56 percent of all violent crimes but received less than one percent of the state's COPS funding.<sup>111</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Many local jurisdictions simply cannot afford the Clinton plan, which requires them to assume a greater portion of the cost each year of the three-year grant period. According to the GAO, almost 7,000 local jurisdictions did not apply for grants, and over 600 turned down the opportunity to participate. Based on a review of jurisdictions that did not apply, the GAO found that in 62 percent of the cases, the reason was their inability to meet the program's financial requirements.<sup>112</sup>  Other reasons included local management decisions and excessive regulatory and paperwork requirements.<sup>113</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Instead of reinforcing merit selection, the Clinton plan encourages quotas. Upon withdrawing from participation in the COPS program, Oklahoma City Police Chief Sam Gonzales observed that the Justice Department's language on the hiring of women and minorities is "very significant" because "it states 'equal employment' of women and minorities rather than 'equal employment opportunity.'"  <sup>114</sup> The program is also inflexible: "There's nothing wrong with community policing, and many cities would be glad to spend federal dollars to implement it. But others, including some large cities, already have instituted community policing and need computers instead."<sup>115</sup>

<p>
<b>BUILDING AN EFFECTIVE LOCAL POLICE FORCE</b>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The federal government cannot improve local police personnel management. That is a job for state and local officials and, given the demands of public safety, is one of their most important responsibilities. They must, therefore, understand the realities of police work and the kinds of standards that should be applied both in recruiting new police officers and in evaluating police performance. They cannot safely indulge racial quotas or accommodate liberal political attacks on merit principles of personnel management.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Local officials also must pay police officers for the job they do; they cannot expect to have a first-rate police department with bargain-basement pay scales or lowered mental and physical standards. The federal government cannot make police officers effective in their communities simply by throwing more money at the problem. At the same time, however, imaginative local officials have demonstrated some dramatic successes.
<blockquote>
	<b>New York City:</b> Taking over a demoralized 38,000-member department in 1994, William J. Bratton declared an all-out war on crime and disorder to reclaim neighborhoods literally block by block. Commissioner Bratton started decentralizing authority, tracked crime trends through a computerized system, and held commanders directly accountable for decreasing crime and disorder in their precincts. He also dismissed high-level police officials who were unable or unwilling to adapt to the new program.<sup>116</sup>  The result: In 1994, major felonies fell by 2 percent nationwide; in New York City, they dropped by 12 percent in 1994 and fell by another 18 percent in the first nine months of 1995.<sup>117</sup>  This dramatic reduction in major felonies over three years also included an almost 45 percent drop in the murder rate.
<p>
	<b>Houston, Texas:</b> In a remarkable experiment in community policing, Houston Police Chief Sam Nuchia started an innovative "citizens patrol program" to supplement the work of the city's police force. The result: Thousands of citizen patrollers have reported criminal activities to the police, arrests have increased, and police productivity has improved.<sup>118</sup>
<p>
	<b>Oxnard, California:</b> Using a sophisticated crime analysis and advanced gang-tracking computer data base developed by a team of experts during the Reagan Administration, police have been able to issue crime alerts to residents in high-crime areas and to target juvenile offenders effectively. The result: violent crime has fallen by 38 percent to its lowest level since the 1960s.<sup>119</sup>  Similar computerized identification and tracking techniques are being used in 130 other jurisdictions.
<p>
	<b>Charleston, South Carolina:</b> Police Chief Reuben Greenberg, widely known for innovative police management, concentrated his efforts on combatting the high level of crime and disorder in the city's public housing projects. Working directly with public housing tenants, Greenberg and his officers helped them screen prospective tenants for criminal records;, tenants engaged in illegal behavior, including drug trafficking, were evicted. The result: Charleston's public housing projects were transformed from one of the most dangerous places in Charleston to one of the "safest."<sup>120</sup>

<p>

<b>THE NEED FOR LOCAL LEADERSHIP</b><P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In the final analysis, the principal problems facing the police today are personnel management and how best to utilize the limited resources available to maintain order and enforce the law. To address these problems, state and local officials should:<ol>

<p><li><b>Get serious about personnel standards.</b> The police officer's job is unique; there is nothing comparable to it in the private sector. Many experts like former New York City Police Commissioner Patrick Murphy therefore favor a four-year college degree, or at least a higher education requirement, as an ideal standard.<sup>121</sup>  Other experts do not see a college or university degree as a necessary condition of appointment, and argue that for persons with demonstrated maturity and diverse life experiences, a high school degree or equivalent may suffice.<sup>122</sup>
<p>
No matter what educational standards they adopt, responsible officials should use standardized tests as an initial screening mechanism to evaluate the cognitive ability of recruits. For patrol officers charged with keeping order on the streets, psychological evaluations and the ability to meet serious physical requirements, measured in physical strength and stamina, are also essential. Most important, background investigations of recruits must include serious inquiries into their past behavior, their reputation for honesty and integrity, their current and past associations, and their financial and marital stability, as well as any evidence of illegal drug use or alcohol abuse.<sup>123</sup>  Periodic re-investigations of personnel, particularly those assigned to specialized tasks such as drug enforcement, also are desirable. Continuing vigilance concerning the character and integrity of the police force is the best defense against the perennial threat of corruption.

<p><li><b>Improve the image of the police.</b> The image of the police officer on the street means a lot: "Cops deserve smart looking uniforms -- and should wear them smartly -- because they represent both the city and the profession."<sup>124</sup>  A police officer's personal appearance and demeanor can help instill respect and confidence among members of the community by creating an image of competence and strength. This is what taxpayers want in their police officers, and it is what they deserve.

<P><li><b>Draw recruits from every sector of the community.</b> Because the mission of the police is of vital concern to every citizen, the police department should represent the community and reflect its demographic composition. Such broader representation is particularly important in minority neighborhoods so that officers can understand the prevailing subculture, prevent and control community disorder, and elicit critical information vital to effective law enforcement. Local officials have a genuine public interest in making their police officers role models and champions of the local community.
<p>
This means that they should cast a wide net and recruit aggressively from every sector of the community. But they should not be deceived by the false god of "diversity at all costs" or by the politically correct premise that simple numerical "underrepresentation" is proof of racial or ethnic discrimination. Nor should they adopt race-based deployment, with only white cops in "white communities" and only black cops in "black communities."<sup>125</sup>  And in no case should personnel management policy make a mockery of merit selection or promotion: "When individual performance is undervalued, professional standards are bound to decline."<sup>126</sup>  Finally, while officials should draw police recruits from the minority community, they should not make membership in the community a condition of appointment: "It is easier to teach police about an area and its residents than to make good police from unqualified applicants."<sup>127</sup>

<p><li><b>Draw recruits from the military.</b> The United States Army recruitment motto "Be all that you can be" applies with equal force to the police. While military and police functions are fundamentally different, and good police work is often the product of an entrepreneurial spirit, military personnel have served in a disciplined organization and are trained in many skills that are useful in police work, including the use of firearms. Veterans preference in recruitment and hiring is being used in many departments, but officials should go further and actively recruit candidates from the military, a talent pool distinguished by high standards of performance. Moreover, for officials wishing to increase the number of minorities serving on the police force, they should realize that blacks make up 11.5 percent of America's civilian population between the ages of 18 and 44 but represent almost 30 percent of the American military, including a large number of senior officers, particularly in the Army: "The military is not free of racial problems found in the civilian world, but it has been more insulated from them because it is a closed and hierarchical society where rank is more important than race or gender."<sup>128</sup>

<p><li><b>Anchor the police in the community.</b> The most effective police officer is not an outsider, but an insider; and the best way to establish effective "community policing" is for local residents to know the police and the police to know the local residents. Foot patrols should be established wherever feasible; the more people the police officer knows, the more effective he will be not only in maintaining order and enforcing community standards, but also in obtaining the sort of solid information that is essential in controlling crime.
<p>
A police officer must get to know the community and its residents and be ready to share information with other officers patrolling the area. If the police officer and his family live in the community, policing becomes more than simply a job; it becomes a matter of protecting one's friends and neighbors. In order to integrate police officers into the community, local officials should consider low-cost housing loans or housing vouchers to enable officers to move into the neighborhoods where they are needed. "The residency requirement is not very effective right now," says Hubert Williams, President of the Police Foundation. "We simply need another approach and police homeownership in high risk or deteriorating neighborhoods is proving to be a successful solution."<sup>129</sup>

<p><li><b>Modernize police management.</b> Too often, police management practices are outdated and do not work.<sup>129</sup>  Bureaucratic civil service rules and regulations and outdated labor/management models impede managerial flexibility and undercut accountability and performance. For example, officers appointed to the detective division should serve on a probationary basis to demonstrate their skills and commitment, just as physicians serve internships. Too often, also, there is little lateral entry into managerial ranks from outside the force. The police force is one of the few organizational cultures in which promotion is almost exclusively through the ranks. Success in the ranks, however, usually depends on responding to incidents, not on strategic planning.<sup>131</sup>  Strategic use of resources, which includes analyzing crime and devising of long-term and short-term solutions, requires an effective planning and research capability to support police management. But less than 1 percent of police budgets are dedicated to research,<sup>132</sup> and planning often is not coordinated effectively with operations leadership.
<p>
Sound personnel management is based on clarity of mission, direct accountability of line management and staff to see that goals are met, and reward for performance. While police work is hardly comparable to anything in the private sector, "Police executives must continually review private sector approaches to managing, developing and supporting people, and transport ideas into the public sector where applicable."<sup>133</sup>
<p>
Commissioner Bratton's success in New York City is partially attributable to the clarity of his goals: "`I don't want a 2 or 3 percent reduction in crime this year -- I want 15 to 25 percent.'  And he got it."<sup>134</sup>  He also devolved authority downward to police commanders in the field, holding them directly accountable for the maintenance of law and order in their jurisdictions and carefully measuring their success and the success of the officers working under their command: "We gave these first line managers the authority to run their precincts as miniature police departments without a lot of petty interference from headquarters. The best ones rose to this opportunity with enthusiasm and creativity."  <sup>135</sup> Commanders must know their precincts, take personal responsibility for conditions there, and respond quickly and effectively to the needs of the community: "As many private sector organizations have discovered, the further from the point of service delivery, the harder it is to make good decisions without good information."<sup>136</sup> 
<p>
<p><li><b>Use sound personnel management to combat police corruption.</b> Conventional wisdom holds that if an officer stays too long on one beat, he may become subject to corruption, particularly by organized crime syndicates. Police corruption can be met in two ways: through serious background investigations, particularly investigations into moral character, and through sound management practices that make commanders directly accountable for the integrity, as well as the performance, of their people. Everyone in the department, from the top executives down through the ranks, must accept responsibility for the integrity of the force: "Few actions erode the confidence of the public or of the police in their own department as much as the indifference of command officers to misconduct by their personnel."<sup>137</sup>  In New York City Commissioner Bratton adopted a highly public strategy of going out and personally arresting corrupt policemen, disgracing them by taking their badges from them for violating their oaths.
<p>
If commanders have to answer for a breakdown in the system's integrity, they also are more likely to ensure both the periodic background investigation of personnel assigned to sensitive details, such as narcotics or organized crime investigations where the temptations of corruption are higher, and the periodic rotation of personnel in such assignments. Police officials, in effect, should impose "term limits" on assignments to such highly sensitive investigative squads.

<p><li><b>Target hot spots.</b> Modern techniques for tracking crime give police officials an opportunity to anticipate and intervene quickly and effectively in high crime areas: "By plotting each homicide incident and using sophisticated mapping and statistical clustering procedures, the early warning system allows police to identify potential neighborhood crisis areas at high risk for suffering a spurt of gang violence. With rapid dissemination of information, police can intervene in hot spots to quell emerging trouble."<sup>138</sup>  Such intervention also can serve to disrupt the trade in illegal narcotics. "The key to making crackdowns work is to keep them short and unpredictable," advises Professor Lawrence Sherman. "Long-term police crackdowns all show a 'decay' in their deterrent effects over time. Short term crackdowns, in contrast, show a free bonus of residual deterrence after the crackdown stops, while potential offenders slowly figure out that the cops are gone."<sup>139</sup>  In Minneapolis, a controlled experiment in "hot spots" interventions in 1988 and 1989 resulted in a 50 percent decline in disorder, including neighborhood fights and other disturbances.<sup>140</sup>

<p><li><b>Target the criminal class and their guns.</b> The population engaged in the most serious crime is relatively small, composed generally of serious habitual offenders, often on probation and parole. They should be a routine target of the police. State lawmakers, for example, can enact laws which make all persons on probation and parole subject to "non-consensual" search for guns or other weapons as a condition of probation or parole.<sup>141</sup>  Stopping and frisking such persons, especially in hot spot areas, is an innovative way to combat gun violence.<sup>142</sup>  Local police officials also can create specialized units that "combine surveillance and sting strategies to catch the offender in the act of crime. The resulting evidence is stronger than arrests made after the fact, thus increasing the odds of the offender being imprisoned."<sup>143</sup>  Finally, as Craig Fraser of the Police Executive Research Forum has suggested, state officials should appoint police chiefs to parole and probation panels, giving them a direct role in the official decision to put prisoners back on the streets.

<p><li><b>Civilianize and privatize administrative and support functions.</b> Too many police officers are tied up with administrative, logistical, and other support duties. Officials should review positions held by police personnel to determine whether the job requires a sworn officer. Where possible, civilians should carry out ancillary administrative functions. Santa Clara, California, for example, established a system of community service officers -- personnel who are not armed and who can conduct traffic accident assistance and investigations, file reports, and serve in school crossing and traffic positions. Community service personnel also can serve as a good pool for recruitment into the regular police ranks.
<p>
Local officials also should consider the privatization of ancillary police services. Most police departments, for example, have a large fleet of automobiles that must be maintained; keeping police cruisers in top condition need not require police personnel, but could be contracted out to private bidders. Privatization is a healthy and growing challenge to police management generally: "Venture capitalists are now exploring the concept of policing corporations which provide policing services to contract cities."<sup>144</sup>

<p><li><b>Reduce the caseloads of detectives.</b> In many urban areas, the caseload for detectives is too high. This problem could be eased by training patrol officers to conduct the early stages of investigations, including the interrogations of witnesses and suspects at or near crime scenes. In order to gain the confidence of detectives on the force, experienced or retired detectives could be used for such training. In the investigation of certain crimes, specially trained officers easily can take over interviewing responsibilities normally reserved for detectives, especially in sensitive areas such as rape or child molestation.<sup>145</sup> 
<p>
Careful interviewing and questioning of informants, witnesses, and suspects is the key to resolving difficult cases. Officials therefore should thoroughly debrief retiring detectives before they leave the force to gather as much information as possible about their investigative techniques, experiences, and other tricks of the trade. Retiring detectives also should transmit to police intelligence units, consistent with respect for confidentiality and the sensitivity of the information, the names of good informants, contacts in the underworld, or other crucial sources of information.

<p><li><b>Improve police compensation.</b> "Bargain basement cops" invariably turn out to be expensive, especially in terms of morale and lost public confidence. Policing must be a desirable middle-class occupation. This means regularly reviewing police pay to make sure that it attracts the best candidates to the force. Officials also should consider pay for performance, at least for police managers,<sup>146</sup> as well as bonuses for officers assigned to dangerous or sensitive investigations. Monies secured from "drug busts," for example, could be used not only for drug rehabilitation and treatment, but also for bonuses for police officers temporarily assigned to narcotics investigations, undercover work, or other dangerous assignments. Nor should local officials neglect other forms of compensation: "Educational incentives, patrol bonuses, watch differentials and alternative work schedules are methods to improve the quality of service delivered and the job satisfaction of line personnel."<sup>147</sup> 

<p><li><b>Use advanced technology.</b> Modern, time-saving equipment can magnify the effectiveness of well-trained police officers. The concept of "working smarter, not harder" is particularly appropriate to police work and can free up the officer's time to maintain the neighborhood contacts vital to community policing. Lap-top computers can speed up the process of report writing and improve the legibility of field reports, making it unnecessary to write out the same information numerous times in order to complete the crime reports, arrest reports, property reports, witness lists, and other paperwork needed to record police incidents.
<p>
Some departments are using innovative electronic information systems to streamline the process of reporting and analysis. In St. Petersburg, Florida, for example, the police are experimenting with electronic docking mechanisms in patrol cars which would allow officers to use computers to receive and transmit information through the police radio system. This would allow all crime incident record keeping processes -- from the original taking of a telephone complaint, through the patrol officer's response and preliminary investigation, to the follow-up investigation by detectives -- to be automated. The resulting improvements in productivity, timeliness, and accuracy would provide multiple benefits both for the police department itself and for the citizens who rely on its services.
<p>
Other advanced electronic devices, such as cellular telephones and facsimile transmission equipment, can enhance patrol officers' ability to communicate while minimizing their time away from the neighborhoods they serve. Automated fingerprint identification systems greatly improve criminal investigations and the apprehension of suspects. Closed-circuit television has many uses, from "line ups" identification to traffic surveillance and physical location security. Advanced simulation technology and computer-generated audio-visual equipment can provide "virtual reality" in police training and increase the accuracy of officer evaluations.
<p>
Even though many municipalities may find it difficult to provide funding for the major capital expenditures necessary to obtain such equipment, they should make a special effort in this direction as a way to improve public safety. Special law enforcement bond issues, private sector contributions, or other innovative means of financing could be used. Likewise, if Congress wants to provide federal funds to local law enforcement, it would be far wiser to make those funds available for capital expenditures on technological improvements which provide long-term value<sup>148</sup> instead of simply paying part of the costs of local police operating expenses, which offer only temporary and limited benefits.
</ol><p><b>
WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN DO</b><P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

State and local officials bear the primary responsibility for combatting most crime, especially street crime. Nevertheless, both Congress and the executive branch can play a supporting role. Among the 15,000 law enforcement jurisdictions in the United States, the challenges to law enforcement are as different as the communities they serve. Therefore, any federal assistance should ensure maximum flexibility for state and local officials in fighting crime in their communities. Specifically, Congress should:<ul>

<p><li><b>Block the appointment of federal judges who demonstrate an insensitivity to public safety.</b> The United States Senate has the constitutional responsibility to give its advice and consent to the appointment of federal judicial nominees. A number of liberal judges appointed to the bench have issued creative rulings to advance the rights of criminal suspects, even to the point of embarrassing the Presidents who appointed them. The Senate should scrutinize judicial candidates more carefully, rely more heavily on the formal advice and testimony of police representatives in the confirmation process, and block the appointment of nominees with records of insensitivity to public safety.

<p><li><b>Review all federal statutes dealing with crime, identify those which impinge on the legitimate authority of local and state law enforcement officials, and repeal them.</b> Currently, there are more than 3,000 federal crime laws on the statute books: "Hardly any crime, no matter how local in nature, is beyond the jurisdiction of federal criminal authorities. Federal crimes now range from serious but purely local crimes like carjacking and drug dealing to trivial crimes like disrupting a rodeo."<sup>149</sup>  The Clinton Administration's 1994 crime bill added two dozen more federal crimes, duplicating offenses already illegal under state and local statutes. Congress should begin to reverse this counterproductive trend toward the federalization of crime -- a process that has been promoted by representatives of both political parties.

<p><li><b>Reform the exclusionary rule.</b> A "good faith" exception to the exclusionary rule would enable prosecutors to introduce incriminating evidence at trial which has been gathered in good faith but otherwise would be ruled inadmissible because of technical violations of procedure by police officers. A process also should be established to discipline officers who abuse proper procedure. As currently formulated, the exclusionary rule suppresses good evidence, causes good arrests to be thrown out, and contributes to the demoralization of the police. This problem is aggravated by tortured interpretations of the law by liberal judges: "If an officer stops a car without adequate reason and finds the butt of a marijuana cigarette on the floor," for example, "there is little public concern when the offense goes unpunished. But if the officer finds a gun that proves the driver committed a murder, the suppression of the gun may set a killer free and outrage the public. The officer's conduct in both cases is the same, but the consequences to the public vary drastically."<sup>150</sup>  A congressionally enacted good faith exception to the exclusionary rule for federal jurisdictions also could encourage state legislatures to enact similar statutes affecting local jurisdictions.

<p><li><b>Review the impact of the Miranda ruling.</b> For three decades, police officers have been operating under the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling in <I>Miranda v. Arizona</I> requiring officers to inform suspects of their right to remain silent and their right to an attorney. Statements made by suspects can be excluded as evidence if the technical rules are not followed precisely. Congress should revisit this ruling to determine its impact on the ability of prosecutors to achieve justice in criminal cases. Professor Paul G. Cassell of the University of Utah College of Law, for example, argues that <I>Miranda</I>, at least as currently enforced, is responsible for thousands of lost criminal cases.<sup>151</sup>  Congress should conduct hearings and enact remedies for any deficiencies in the application of <I>Miranda</I> rules, including an alternative to the exclusion of valid probative evidence.

<p><li><b>Make federal funding of local law enforcement user friendly.</b> Neither federal programs nor increases in federal anti-crime spending have had much impact in reducing violent crime at the local level, and early indications are that President Clinton's multibillion dollar COPS program will follow this pattern. If Congress wants to help state and local officials, it should break away from outdated and ineffective patterns of federal spending.
<p>
Under an innovative proposal by Representative F. James Sensenbrenner (R-WI), for example, 2 percent of the federal personal income tax taken from the residents of each state would be returned to the state to fight crime. These tax rebates would be free of the federal intrusions that accompany categorical grants and would allow state officials to use the money for their specific needs, such as police staffing and equipment, community policing, crime prevention, or prison programs. These rebates would amount to $55 billion over a five-year period, a steady stream of funding both more flexible and more generous than that contained in the Clinton Administration's crime bill.<sup>152</sup>  The tax rebate strategy also has the advantage of creating strong incentives for local officials to spend the money wisely, targeting what is necessary rather than what is merely desirable. The reason: Under the Sensenbrenner proposal, state officials also would have the option of giving money back to the taxpayers directly in the form of tax cuts. 

<p><li><b>Review D.C. police pay and personnel management practices.</b> Since Congress in the late 1980s and early 1990s contributed directly to the problems of the police in the nation's capital, it should work cooperatively with local officials to make the D.C. police force the national model it once was. This includes reviewing pay and personnel management practices, particularly the recruiting and hiring of police officers. Washington Police Chief Larry Soulsby already has embarked on a comprehensive retraining program for 2,700 officers, nearly 75 percent of the force. This retraining covers everything from ethics and criminal procedures to street tactics and the preparation of police reports, a critical subject since "Unclear or misleading statements in those documents can jeopardize prosecution of criminal cases."<sup>153</sup>

<p><li><b>Pursue an innovative empowerment strategy to revitalize inner-city neighborhoods plagued by crime and disorder.</b> Over the past 40 years, Congress has enacted numerous social programs aimed at crime "prevention," including federal programs for "at risk" and delinquent youth. The General Accounting Office recently identified 131 such overlapping federal programs for "at risk" youth alone, administered by 16 federal agencies at an annual cost of over $4 billion.<sup>154</sup>
<p>
Innovative community policing strategies should be combined with imaginative new social policies. Representatives James Talent (R-MO) and J. C. Watts (R-OK), for example, are sponsoring Saving Our Children: The American Community Renewal Act of 1996 (H.R. 3467). This comprehensive initiative would establish a new federal policy to empower parents and neighborhood organizations, such as black churches and other religious institutions, to educate children trapped in poorly performing inner-city schools, in addition to encouraging faith-based drug and alcohol rehabilitation and other private social service programs that work.<sup>155</sup>  Dr. Richard Freeman of Harvard University has found that black inner-city youth who have religious values are 54 percent less likely to use drugs and 50 percent less likely to engage in criminal activities than those without religious values.<sup>156</sup>
<p>
One final recommendation applies specifically to the executive branch: 
<p><li><b>Improve the sharing of information with state and local officials.</b> In carrying out their constitutional responsibilities to combat interstate and international crime, as well as to control United States borders, federal law enforcement agencies should maximize their coordination and cooperation with state and local police. The Federal Bureau of Investigation in particular can provide valuable technical assistance and training, specialized support in the fields of identification and scientific investigation, and central facilities for the collection and dissemination of statistical data, criminal intelligence, and other relevant information on a national basis.
</ul><p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b><P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

No American family is safe from the threat of crime. In some inner-city neighborhoods, the situation is positively desperate. And with the rising tide of violent juvenile crime, millions of Americans will be locked behind their doors, imprisoned in their own homes in deteriorating neighborhoods. In far too many urban areas, law-abiding citizens cannot go to the store, take a stroll in the park, or even visit friends and relatives without fear of violent assault. These people need the best police protection they can get. It is the job of state and local officials to give it to them.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

To do this, they must get serious about the mission of the police and expand their use of the kinds of personnel management principles that can attract and hold first-rate police officers. This includes setting and maintaining high standards for appointment; drawing from every sector of the community; drawing from the military, particularly to broaden minority representation; aggressively targeting both hot spots and the criminal class; anchoring police officers in the community; modernizing police management and privatizing and civilianizing support functions wherever possible; and improving police compensation.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Congress can play a supportive role in this drama, but not a definitive one. This means repealing federal laws which impede the ability of local police to enforce the law. Specifically, Congress should reformulate the exclusionary rule to allow the inclusion of evidence gathered in good faith by police officers; review the impact of <I>Miranda</I> on police criminal investigations; stop the appointment of lenient federal judges; and change the funding formulas for federal financial assistance to the states, replacing the current grant-in-aid system with a more generous tax rebate that allows state and local officials maximum flexibility to combat violent crime.

   <p><li> Under the 1996 Prison Litigation Reform Act, Congress has restricted federal judicial control over state prison systems. The new law limits court-ordered relief in suits challenging prison conditions; only specific violations of an inmate's constitutional rights now qualify for relief. Furthermore, the court must consider whether its remedy would harm public safety. The new law also restricts court-ordered prison population caps by requiring a court finding that overcrowding is the primary cause of the violation of a prisoner's constitutional rights.

In the evaluation of social programs, especially those conducted by the General Accounting Office, Congress should order the study of success, not just the many federal programs that don't work.
<p><li>    The problem is long-standing: "The police feel that they deserve respect from the public. But the upper class looks down on them; the middle class seems to ignore them, as if they were part of the urban scenery; the lower class fears them." Arthur Niederhoff, <I>Behind the Shield: The Police in Urban Society</I> (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday and Company, 1967), p. 9. The literature on the police and public policy is rich and growing. While chronologically dated, Niederhoff's work and James Q. Wilson's <I>Varieties of Police Behavior: The Management of Law and Order in Eight Communities</I> (New York, N.Y.: Atheneum Press, 1970) are foundational. See also J. S. Skolnick, <I>Justice Without Trial: Law Enforcement in a Democratic Society</I> (New York, N.Y.: John Wiley and Sons, 1966).
  <p><li>  Fully 91 percent of New York City police officers responding to a recent survey felt that the public has little understanding of police problems. Kelling, "How to Run a Police Department," p. 37.
   <p><li> "The patroleman is neither a bureaucrat nor a professional, but a member of a craft. As with most crafts, his has no body of generalized written knowledge nor a set of detailed prescriptions as to how to behave. It has in short, neither theory nor rules. Learning the craft is by apprenticeship, but on the job and not in the academy." Wilson, <I>Varieties of Police Behavior</I>, p. 283.

Culturally, these standards appear light-years away from personal behavior that would be ignored or even approved today. Niederhoff notes, for example, that "A young unmarried honor policeman with two years of service was threatened with dismissal because he allegedly had sexual intercourse with an unmarried woman during his probationary period." <i>Ibid</i>., p. 155.

In an older extensive study covering the period 1950-1965, the average number of suicides in the general New York City population for males was 15 per 100,000, but the average police rate was 22.7 per 100,000, a rate substantially higher than the general population.

  <p><li>  Roger A. Freeman of the Hoover Institution compiled these estimates for the late 1950s through the 1960s and 1970s. In accounting for technical changes in "reporting procedures," he revised the overall crime growth downward to 441 percent. Freeman nonetheless concluded: "The evidence at hand does not suggest that ballooning the police force is an effective or promising way of stemming the growth of crime." Roger A.

It is well to recall that 30 to 40 percent of all boys in urban areas will be arrested at least once before they turn 18 years of age, and most boys will never be arrested again by the police.

   <p><li> Commenting on the professional culture of the famed New York City detective division in the 1950s and 1960s, Arthur Niederhoff, a former New York City policeman, observes that "Detectives are the upper class of police society and haughtily guard their special status and privileges. Their quarters are separate from those of the uniformed police. Within this private domain democratic camaraderie eliminates the social distance that ordinarily divides the various ranks of a bureaucratic hierarchy.... It is of special significance that this high status unit, to which every member of the lower echelon aspires, performs best when disregarding formal regulations and official procedures." Niederhoff, <I>Behind the Shield</I>, pp. 83-85.
 <p><li>   The Supreme Court qualified its <i>Miranda </i>ruling in <I>Harris v. New York</I> (1971), ruling that if an accused person makes statements on the witness stand that differ from statements made to the police, the prosecution can introduce the earlier statements into the record for purposes of discrediting the testimony of the accused.
<p><li>    See Paul Cassell, <I>Reforming Miranda: A Proposal for Congressional Action,</I> College of Law, University of Utah, 1994.
 <p><li>   "A good detective must be suspicious; he needs the intuitive ability to sense plots and conspiracies on the basis of embryonic evidence," says Niederhoff, but the qualifications are hard to establish: "A strong minority on the [New York] police force asserts... that a detective's value and future success depends on the private sources of information at his disposal, and his willingness to do the necessary legwork. They support this opinion by citing the many brilliant detectives in police history who could never have passed an IQ test, could hardly write an intelligible report, and whose techniques of investigation violated every recommended principle of scientific detection."

  <p><li>  "Incidents that would cause commotion and consternation in quiet precincts seem so common in ghetto neighborhoods that they are often not reported. The police rationalize this avoidance of duty with theories that the victim would refuse to prosecute because violence has become the accepted way of life for his community, and that any other course would result in a great loss of time in court, which would reduce the efficiency of other police functions."

  <p><li>  "This doctrine encourages an observer from one culture to respect the integrity of another, although its standards of behavior may be different from his own. The implication is that the policeman has some justification for accepting a minority group's way of life on its own terms, and thus for acting the way he does. There is no easy answer to this paradox." Niederhoff, <I>Behind the Shield</I>, p. 66.
  <p><li>  Professor Butler's basic argument is that since the United States is "structurally" racist, blacks are victimized by the American system, and black jurors have, therefore, no obligation to up hold its system of justice, at least as applied to blacks who commit non-violent crimes.

<p><li>     Craig Fraser of the Police Executive Research Forum, for example, argues that 21- or 22-year-old college graduates may test well and have outstanding academic records, but they frequently have little or no exposure to life outside a college setting. Having been dependent on parental authority and institutional settings throughout their late teens and early twenties, such persons would be struggling as police officers, not only in using discretion on the street, but also in trying to live on their own. Interview with Craig Fraser, November 17, 1994.
  <p><li>   For local officials, this policy recommendation may turn out to be much more than a good idea. The United States Supreme Court recently agreed to hear a case (<I>Bryan County v. Brown</I>) and decide whether an Oklahoma county must pay money damages to a victim of police brutality because the officer charged with brutality was hired without any serious background investigation. The officer had a history of criminal misdemeanors, including an arrest for assault and battery.

<B> INTRODUCTION</B><P>
     Policymakers at last are coming to recognize the connection between
the breakdown of American families and various social problems.  The
unfolding debate over welfare reform, for instance, has been shaped by the
wide acceptance in recent years that children born into single-parent families
are much more likely than children of intact families to fall into poverty and
welfare dependence themselves in later years.  These children, in fact, face
a daunting array of problems.
<P>
     While this link between illegitimacy and chronic welfare dependency
now is better understood, policymakers also need to appreciate another
strong and disturbing pattern evident in scholarly studies:  the link between 
illegitimacy and violent crime and between the lack of parental attachment
and violent crime.  Without an understanding of the root causes of criminal
behavior -- how criminals are formed -- Members of Congress and state
legislators cannot understand why whole sectors of society, particularly in
urban areas, are being torn apart by crime.  And without that knowledge,
sound policymaking is impossible.
<P>
          A review of the empirical evidence in the professional
literature of the social sciences gives policymakers an insight into the root
causes of crime.  Consider, for instance:
<P>
Over the past thirty years, the rise in violent crime parallels the rise in
families abandoned by fathers.
<P>
High-crime neighborhoods are characterized by high concentrations of
families abandoned by fathers.
<P>
State-by-state analysis by Heritage scholars indicates that a 10 percent
increase in the percentage of children living in single-parent homes leads
typically to a 17 percent increase in juvenile crime.
<P>
The rate of violent teenage crime corresponds with the number of families
abandoned by fathers.
<P>
The type of aggression and hostility demonstrated by a future criminal often
is foreshadowed in unusual aggressiveness as early as age five or six.
<P>
The future criminal tends to be an individual rejected by other children as
early as the first grade who goes on to form his own group of friends, often
the future delinquent gang.
<P>
On the other hand: 
<P>
Neighborhoods with a high degree of religious practice are not high-crime
neighborhoods.
<P>
Even in high-crime inner-city neighborhoods, well over 90 percent of
children from safe, stable homes do not become delinquents.  By contrast
only 10 percent of children from unsafe, unstable homes in these
neighborhoods avoid crime.
<P>
Criminals capable of sustaining marriage gradually move away from a life
of crime after they get married.
<P>
The mother's strong affectionate attachment to her child is the child's best
buffer against a life of crime.
<P>
The father's authority and involvement in raising his children are also a
great buffer against a life of crime.
<P>
     The scholarly evidence, in short, suggests that at the heart of the
explosion of crime in America is the loss of the capacity of fathers and
mothers to be responsible in caring for the children they bring into the
world.  This loss of love and guidance at the intimate levels of marriage and
family has broad social consequences for children and for the wider
community.  The empirical evidence shows that too many young men and
women from broken families tend to have a much weaker sense of
connection with their neighborhood and are prone to exploit its members to
satisfy their unmet needs or desires.  This contributes to a loss of a sense
of community and to the disintegration of neighborhoods into social chaos
and violent crime.  If policymakers are to deal with the root causes of
crime, therefore, they must deal with the rapid rise of illegitimacy.
     
     <P>     

<B> OFFICIAL WASHINGTON'S VIEW OF CRIME </B><P>
     The professional literature in criminology is quite at odds with
orthodox thinking in official Washington.  Many lawmakers in Congress and
in the states assume that the high level of crime in America must have its
roots in material conditions, such as poor employment opportunities and a
shortage of adequately funded social programs.  But Members of Congress
and other policymakers cannot understand the root causes of crime if they
insist on viewing it purely in material terms.  This view blinds policymakers
to the personal aspects of crime, including moral failure, the refusal to
exercise personal responsibility, and the inability or refusal to enter into
family and community relationships based on love, respect, and attachment
both to the broader community and to a common code of conduct.
<P>
          The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of
1994, supported by the Clinton Administration and enacted last year,
perfectly embodies official Washington's thinking about crime.  It provides
for billions of dollars in new spending, adding 15 new social programs on
top of a welfare system that has cost taxpayers $5 trillion since the "War on
Poverty" was declared in 1965.  There is no reason to suppose the
programs will have any significant effect.  Since 1965, welfare spending has
increased 800 percent in real terms, while the number of major felonies per
capita today is roughly three times the rate before 1960.  As Senator Phil
Gramm (R-TX) says, "If social spending stopped crime we would be the
safest country in the world."
<P>
          Senator Joseph Biden (D-DE), former chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee and a major sponsor of the recent crime bill, summed
up the predominant view of crime prevention:  "These [social services] are
all good programs.  They are all designed to do the same thing -- give these
kids something to say yes to."  Likewise, the Department of Justice's report,
"Comprehensive Strategy for Serious, Violent and Chronic Juvenile
Offenders," accurately diagnoses the roots of the problem (in terms of
family, religion, and moral formation), but then recommends a long list of
new federal social programs on top of the current programs.
      <P>
           But the conventional assumptions about the root causes of
crime -- and thus the solutions -- are wide of the mark:
<P>
<B> Poverty and Unemployment </B>
<P>
     The central proposition in official Washington's thinking about crime
is that poverty is the primary cause of crime.  In its simplest form, this
contention is absurd; if it were true, there would have been more crime in
the past, when more people were poorer.  And in poorer nations, the crime
rates would be higher than in the United States.  More significantly, history
defies the assumption that deteriorating economic circumstances breed crime
(and improving conditions reduce it).  Instead, America's crime rate
gradually rose during the long period of real economic growth:  1905 to
1933.  As the Great Depression set in and incomes dropped, the crime rate
also dropped.  It rose again between 1965 and 1974 when incomes rose
steadily.  Most recently, during the recession of 1982, there was a slight dip
in crime, not an increase.
<P>
          What is true of the general population is also true of black
Americans.  For example, between 1950 and 1974 black income in
Philadelphia almost doubled, and homicides more than doubled.  Even the
Reverend Jesse Jackson, whose prescriptions for social reform mirror
conventional liberal ideology, admits that black-on-black homicide is not an
issue of poverty.  The crime rate in other communities also shows no link
between low incomes and crime.  The Chinese in San Francisco in the mid-
1960s, for instance, had the lowest family income of any ethnic group (less
than $4,000 per year) but next to no crime:  only 5 Chinese in all of
California were then in prison.
<P>
<B> Race and Crime </B>
<P>
     There is a widespread belief that race is a major explanatory cause
of crime.  This belief is anchored in the large disparity in crime rates
between whites and blacks.  However, a closer look at the data shows that
the real variable is not race but family structure and all that it implies in
commitment and love between adults.  The incidence of broken families is
much higher in the black community.  Douglas Smith and G.  Roger
Jarjoura, in a major 1988 study of 11,000 individuals, found that "the
percentage of single-parent households with children between the ages of 12
and 20 is significantly associated with rates of violent crime and burglary." 
The same study makes clear that the widespread popular assumption that
there is an association between race and crime is false.  Illegitimacy is the
key factor.  It is the absence of marriage, and the failure to form and
maintain intact families, that explains the incidence of high crime in a
neighborhood among whites as well as blacks.  This contradicts
conventional wisdom.
     <P>
          Bolstering the Smith-Jarjoura study, University of Illinois
sociologist Robert J.  Sampson, in a study on the differential effects of
poverty and family disruption on crime, states:
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> Overall the analysis shows that rates of black violent
     offending, especially by juveniles, are strongly influenced by
     variations in family structure.  Independent of the major
     candidates supplied by prior criminological theory (e.g. 
     income, region, size, density, age and race composition)
     black family disruption has the largest effects on black
     juvenile robbery and homicide.... The effects of family
     structure are strong and cannot be easily dismissed by
     reference to other structural and cultural features of urban
     environments.... The effect of family disruption on black
     violence is not due to the effect of black violence on family
     structure.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     Sampson adds:  "the predictors of white robbery are in large part
identical in sign and magnitude to those for blacks."
<P>
<B> HOW CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR DEVELOPS </B>
<P>
     Propensity to crime develops in stages associated with major
psychological and sociological factors.  The factors are not caused by race
or poverty, and the stages are the normal tasks of growing up that every
child confronts as he gets older.  In the case of future violent criminals these
tasks, in the absence of the love, affection, and dedication of both his
parents, become perverse exercises, frustrating his needs and stunting his
ability to belong.
<P>
 <BLOCKQUOTE> The stages are: </BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
 Early infancy and the development of the capacity for empathy.
Early family life and the development of relationships based on agreements
being kept and a sense of an intimate place where he belongs.
Early school life and the development of peer relationships based on
cooperation and agreements conveying a sense of a community to which he
belongs.
<P>
Mid-childhood and the experience of a growing capacity to learn and
cooperate within his community.
<P>
Adolescence and the need to belong as an adult and to perform. 
<P>
 Generativity, or the begetting of the next generation through intimate sexual
union and bringing others into the family and the community.
<P>
     In all of these stages the lack of dedication and the atmosphere of
rejection or conflict within the family diminish the child's experience of his
personal life as one of love, dedication, and a place to belong.  Instead, it
is characterized increasingly by rejection, abandonment, conflict, isolation,
and even abuse.  He is compelled to seek a place to belong outside of such
a home and, most frequently not finding it in the ordinary community, finds
it among others who have experienced similar rejection.  He becomes
attached to those who are alienated, for, like him, they have been rejected. 
Not finding acceptance and nurturance from caring adults, they begin
conveying their own form of acceptance.
<P>
<B> STAGE ONE:  THE BROKEN FAMILY </B>
<P>
     The evidence of the professional literature is overwhelming:  teenage
criminal behavior has its roots in habitual deprivation of parental love and
affection going back to early infancy.  Future delinquents invariably have
a chaotic, disintegrating family life.  This frequently leads to aggression and
hostility toward others outside the family.  Most delinquents are not
withdrawn or depressed.  Quite the opposite:  they are actively involved in
their neighborhood, but often in a violent fashion.  This hostility is
established in the first few years of life.  By age six, habits of aggression
and free-floating anger typically are already formed.  By way of contrast,
normal children enjoy a sense of personal security derived from their natural
attachment to their mother.  The future criminal is often denied that natural
attachment.
<P>
          The relationship between parents, not just the relationship
between mother and child, has a powerful effect on very young children. 
Children react to quarreling parents by disobeying, crying, hitting other
children, and in general being much more antisocial than their peers. 
And, significantly, quarreling or abusive parents do not generally vent their
anger equally on all their children.  Such parents tend to vent their anger on
their more difficult children.  This parental hostility and physical and
emotional abuse of the child shapes the future delinquent.
<P>
          Most delinquents are children who have been abandoned by
their fathers.  They are often deprived also of the love and affection they
need from their mother.  Inconsistent parenting, family turmoil, and
multiple other stresses (such as economic hardship and psychiatric
illnesses) that flow from these disagreements compound the rejection of
these children by these parents, many of whom became criminals during
childhood.  With all these factors working against the child's normal
development, by age five the future criminal already will tend to be
aggressive, hostile, and hyperactive.  Four-fifths of children destined to be
criminals will be "antisocial" by 11 years of age, and fully two-thirds of
antisocial five-year-olds will be delinquent by age 15. 
<P>
           Summing up the findings of the professional literature on
juvenile delinquency, Kevin Wright, professor of criminal justice at the State
University of New York at Binghamton, writes:  "Research confirms that
children raised in supportive, affectionate, and accepting homes are less
likely to become deviant.  Children rejected by parents are among the most
likely to become delinquent."
     <P>
     
     
     

<B> Family Condition Leading to Crime #1:  Fatherless Families </B>
<P>
     According to the professional literature, the absence of the father is
the single most important cause of poverty.  The same is true for crime. 
According to Kevin and Karen Wright, 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Research into the idea that single-parent homes may produce
     more delinquents dates back to the early 19th century....
     [O]fficials at New York State's Auburn Penitentiary, in an
     attempt to discern the causes of crime, studied the
     biographies of incarcerated men.  Reports to the legislature
     in 1829 and 1830 suggested that family disintegration
     resulting from the death, desertion, or divorce of parents led
     to undisciplined children who eventually became criminals. 
     Now well over a century later, researchers continue to
     examine the family background of unique populations and
     reach similar conclusions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
     <P>
     The growth of the poverty-ridden family today is linked directly with
the growth of the family headed by the always-single mother.  And this
modern form of family disintegration -- or more accurately non-formation
-- has its consequences for criminal behavior.  The growth in crime is
paralleled by the growth in families abandoned by fathers.
<P>
     As the chart on the following page shows, the rate of juvenile crime
within each state is closely linked to the percentage of children raised in
single-parent families.  States with a lower percentage of single-parent
families, on average, will have lower rates of juvenile crime.  State-by-state
analysis indicates that, in general, a 10 percent increase in the number of
children living in single-parent homes (including divorces) accompanies a
17 percent increase in juvenile crime.
<P>
     Along with the increased probability of family poverty and
heightened risk of delinquency, a father's absence is associated with a host
of other social problems.  The three most prominent effects are lower
intellectual development, higher levels of illegitimate parenting in the
teenage years, and higher levels of welfare dependency.  According to a
1990 report from the Department of Justice, more often than not, missing
and "throwaway" children come from single-parent families, families with
step parents, and cohabiting-adult families.
<P>
     Abandoned mothers.  In normal families a father gives support to his
wife, particularly during the period surrounding birth and in the early
childhood years when children make heavy demands on her.  In popular
parlance, he is her "burn-out" prevention.  But a single mother does not
have this support, and the added emotional and physical stress may result
in fatigue and less parent availability to the child, increasing the risk of a
relationship with the child that is emotionally more distant.  The single
mother generally is less able to attend to all of her child's needs as quickly
or as fully as she could if she were well taken care of by a husband.  These
factors tend to affect the mother's emotional attachment to her child and in
turn reduce the child's lifelong capacity for emotional attachment to others
and empathy for others.  Such empathy helps restrain a person from acting
against others' well-being.  Violent criminals obviously lack this.  At the
extreme, and a more common situation in America's inner cities, the distant
relationship between a mother and child can become an abusing and
neglectful relationship.  Under such conditions the child is at risk of
becoming a psychopath. 
<P>
      These observations have disturbing implications for society.  If the
conditions in which psychopathy is bred continue to increase, then America
will have proportionately more psychopaths, and society is at an increased
risk of suffering in unpredictable ways.
<P>
     Abandoned sons.  A father's attention to his son has enormous
positive effects on a boy's emotional and social development.  But a boy
abandoned by his father is deprived of a deep sense of personal security. 
According to Rolf Loeber, Professor of Psychiatry, Psychology and
Epidemiology at the Western Psychiatric Institute in the University of
Pittsburgh School of Medicine, "A close and intense relationship between
a boy and his father prevents hostility and inappropriate aggressiveness." 
This inappropriate aggressiveness is an early indication of potential
delinquency later on, particularly in boys.  Furthermore, such bad
behavior is a barrier to the child's finding a place among his more normal
peers, and aggressiveness usually is the precursor of a hostile and violent
"street" attitude.  Elijah Anderson, Professor of Sociology at the University
of Pennsylvania, observes that these young men, very sensitive in their
demands for "respect," display a demeanor which communicates "deterrent
aggression" not unlike the behavior that causes normal peers to reject and
isolate aggressive boys in grade school.  The message of this body
language, of course, triggers rejection by the normal adult community.
<P>
     Absence of a Father's Authority and Discipline.  The dominant role
of fathers in preventing delinquency is well-established.  Over forty years
ago, this phenomenon was highlighted in the classic studies of the causes of
delinquency by Sheldon and Eleanor Glueck of Harvard University. 
They described in academic terms what many children hear their mothers
so often say:  "Wait till your father gets home!"  In a well-functioning
family, the very presence of the father embodies authority, an authority
conveyed through his daily involvement in family life.  This paternal
authority is critical to the prevention of psychopathology and
delinquency. 
<P>
      The benefits a child receives from his relationship with his father
are notably different from those derived from his relationship with his
mother.  The father contributes a sense of paternal authority and discipline
which is conveyed through his involved presence.  The additional benefits
of his affection and attachment add to this primary benefit.  Albert Bandura,
professor of psychology at Stanford University, observed as early as 1959
that delinquents suffer from an absence of the father's affection.
<P>
<B> Family Condition Leading to Crime #2:  The Absence of a Mother's
Love
</B><P>
     According to Professor Rolf Loeber of the University of Pittsburgh
School of Medicine:  "There is increasing evidence for an important critical
period that occurs early in children's lives.  At that time, youngsters'
attachment to adult caretakers is formed.  This helps them to learn prosocial
skills and to unlearn any aggressive or acting out behaviors."
<P>
     The early experience of intense maternal affection is the basis for the
development of a conscience and moral empathy with others.
<P>
     If a child's emotional attachment to his mother is disrupted during
the first few years, permanent harm can be done to his capacity for
emotional attachment to others.  He will be less able to trust others and
throughout his life will stay more distant emotionally from others.  Having
many different caretakers during the first few years can lead to a loss of this
sense of attachment for life and to antisocial behavior.  Separation from
the mother, especially between six months and three years of age, can lead
to long lasting negative effects on behavior and emotional development. 
Severe maternal deprivation is a critical ingredient of juvenile delinquency: 
As John Bowlby, the father of attachment research, puts it, "Theft, like
rheumatic fever, is a disease of childhood, and, as in rheumatic fever,
attacks in later life are frequently in the nature of recurrences."  A child's
emotional attachment to his mother is powerful in other ways.  For example,
even after a period of juvenile delinquency, a young man's ability to
become emotionally attached to his wife can make it possible for him to
turn away from crime.  This capacity is rooted in the very early
attachment to his mother.  We also know that a weak marital attachment
resulting in separation or divorce accompanies a continuing life of crime.
<P>
     Many family conditions can weaken a mother's attachment to her
young child.  Perhaps the mother herself is an emotionally unattached
person.  The mother could be so lacking in family and emotional support
that she cannot fill the emotional needs of the child.  She could return to
work, or be forced to return to work, too soon after the birth of her child. 
Or, while she is at work, there could be a change in the personnel
responsible for the child's day care.  The more prevalent these conditions,
the less likely a child will be securely attached to his mother and the more
likely he will be hostile and aggressive.
<P>
     The mother's relationship with her children during this early period
is also relevant to the debate over child care.  According to Professor James
Q.  Wilson of the University of California at Los Angeles, the extended
absence of a working mother from her child during the early critical stages
of the child's emotional development increases the risk of delinquency. 
Specifically, say Stephen Cernkovich and Peggy Giordano, "maternal
employment affects behavior indirectly, through such factors as lack of
supervision, loss of direct control, and attenuation of close relationships." 
Thus, forcing a young single mother to return to work too soon after the
birth of her baby is bad public policy.  Unfortunately, the Clinton
Administration's welfare reform bill would do just that.
<P>

<B> Family Condition Leading to Crime #3:  Parental Fighting and
Domestic Violence </B>
<P>
     The empirical evidence shows that, for a growing child, the happiest
and most tranquil family situation is the intact primary marriage.  But
even within intact two-parent families, serious parental conflict has bad
effects.  The famous studies of Harvard professors Sheldon and Eleanor
Glueck in the 1950s found that one-third of delinquent boys in their sample
came from homes with spouse abuse.  The Cambridge-Somerville Youth
Study observed that the incidence of delinquent behavior was higher in
intact homes characterized by a high degree of conflict and neglect than it
was in broken homes without conflict.  Dr.  Travis Hirschi, professor of
criminology at Arizona State University, in a study of junior and senior high
school children in Northern California, replicated these findings a decade
later.  As these and other studies have shown, the lack of emotional
attachment to parents is more strongly related to delinquency than is an
intact home.  Professor Kevin N.  Wright, in his review of the literature
for the Department of Justice, lists 21 other major studies that clearly show
the link between parental conflict and delinquency.  The lesson is clear: 
conflict between parents hurts the child.  The more frequent or intense the
conflict, the more the child is hurt emotionally.  In sharp contrast,
tranquillity and peace in the family and in the marriage help prevent
delinquency.
<P>
     Family Breakup.  Breakup of his parents' marriage during the first
five years of his life places a child at high risk of becoming a juvenile
delinquent.  This breakup -- through either divorce or separation -- is
most likely to occur three to four years after marriage.  Therefore, a large
proportion of very young children experience the emotional pain of the early
and final stages of marital dissolution at a time when they are most
vulnerable to disruptions in their emotional attachment to their parents. 
<P>
      Conflict within "step families" (families where at least one of the
married parents is not the biological parent of all the children) also has
serious effects.  According to the California Youth Authority study of
female delinquents, conducted by Jill Leslie Rosenbaum, professor of
criminology at California State University, "In the two parent families
examined in this study a great deal of conflict was present.  Of these
parents, 71 percent fought regularly about the children.  Since there were
often 'his', 'hers' and 'theirs' present, the sources of conflict tended to
result from one set of children having a bad influence on the others, the type
of punishment invoked, or one particular child receiving too much
attention." <P>

      Rates of conflict are much higher outside intact marriage
families.  Not surprisingly, the rates of emotional and behavioral
problems of children are more than double in step families.  Given their
impact on children, the marriage arrangements of parents have significant
effects on the incidence of teenage crime.
<P>
<B> Family Condition Leading to Crime #4:  The Lack of Parental
Supervision and Discipline </B>
<P>
     The absence of parental supervision and discipline often is due
simply to a lack of parenting skill, particularly if the parents were not
supervised properly by their own parents.  Summarizing the findings of the
Oregon Group, a team of social science researchers under the leadership of
Gerald R.  Patterson of the Oregon Social Learning Center, James Q. 
Wilson of UCLA writes: 
<P>
<UL>[I]n order for the parent to teach the child not to use force
     or fraud, the parent must 
   <P><UL> 
          monitor the child's behavior; 
     <P>
          recognize deviant behavior when it occurs; and 
    <P> 
          punish such behavior.</UL>
<P>
      All that is required to activate the system is affection for or
     investment in the child.  The parent who cares for the child
     will watch his behavior, see him doing things he should not
     do, and correct him.  Presto, a decent, socialized human
     being.</UL>
  <P>   
     Summarizing the Oregon Group's work on parental skills, Professor
Kevin Wright advises:  "Notice what the child is doing, monitor it over long
periods of time, model social skill behavior, clearly state house rules,
consistently provide some punishments for transgressions, provide
reinforcement for conformity, and negotiate disagreement so the conflicts
and crises do not escalate.  Monitoring children involves awareness of their
companions, whereabouts, and free-time activities.  It also includes
appropriate communication, accountability of the child to the parents and the
amount of time spent with parents."  A host of other studies confirm that
good supervision is at least as powerful as parental emotional attachment to
the child and other forms of indirect control.  Monitoring fills the child's
need for parental attention, moral education, and correction.
<P>
     The children of single teenage mothers are more at risk for later
criminal behavior.  One reason is that teenage single mothers monitor their
children less than older married mothers do.  They are more inclined to
have an inconsistent, explosively angry approach to disciplining their
children.  In such homes family members, including children, generally use
aggressive, coercive methods to make sure their needs are met by others in
the family.  The parent's inability to monitor a child's behavior
compounds the hostility between parent and child and leads to the first of
the two major stages in delinquency described by the Oregon Group: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[The first stage is a] breakdown in family management
     procedures, producing an increase in antisocial behavior and
     an impairment in social skills and application at school.  [In]
     the second stage, during adolescence, these conditions
     continue and the disruptions in the parents' monitoring
     practices and the adolescent's own poor social skills place
     him further at risk for finding his community in a deviant
     peer group.</BLOCKQUOTE>
     <P>
      While parental monitoring and supervision obviously are good for
children, harsh or excessive discipline has just the opposite effect.  The
parents of delinquents are harsher than ordinary parents in punishing their
children; and depressed, stressed, or hostile parents more likely will vent
their anger on their more aggressive children.  In the case of the single
teenage mother, the absence of the father increases the risk of harshness
from the mother.  For these children, harsh punishment can mean parental
rejection.  "Punishment that is too strict, frequent or severe can lead to a
greater probability of delinquency regardless of parental attachments.  That
is, a strong parent-child bond will not lessen the adverse impact of
punishment that is too harsh."
<P>

<B> Family Condition Leading to Crime #5:  Rejection of the Child </B>
<P>
     Jill Leslie Rosenbaum, professor of criminology at California State
University, writes:  "Research consistently has shown that those youth
whose bond to their parents is weak are more likely to be delinquent. 
[Y]outh who are more attached to their parents have greater direct and
indirect controls placed on their behavior."
<P>
     As a child's emotional attachment to his parents ensures a well-
adjusted adult, so parental rejection of the child has powerful opposite
effects.  Ronald Simons, professor of sociology at Iowa State University,
summarizes the research findings:  "Rejected children tend to distrust and
attribute malevolent motives to others, with the result being a defensive, if
not aggressive, approach to peer interactions.... Such [rejecting] parents not
only fail to model and reinforce prosocial behavior, they actually provide
training in aggressive noncompliant behavior."
<P>
     Rejection by the family, which is the child's first and fundamental
"community," sets the stage for another social tragedy.  Rejected children
tend gradually to drop out of normal community life.  Professor Simons
continues:  "Parental rejection... increased the probability of a youth's
involvement in a deviant peer group, reliance upon an avoidant coping style,
and use of substances."  Many other studies in the professional literature
replicate these findings.
<P>
<B> Family Condition Leading to Crime #6:  Parental Abuse or Neglect </B>
<P>
     The professional literature is replete with findings of a connection
between future delinquency and criminal behavior and the abuse and neglect
visited upon children by their parents.  This abuse can be physical,
emotional, or sexual.  "Overwhelmingly," observes Patricia Koski,
"studies conducted since 1964 have found a positive correlation between
parent-child aggression-violence-abuse-physical punishment and aggression
on the part of the child."  Or, as summarized by Cathy Spatz Widom,
professor of Criminal Justice and Psychology at Indiana University,
Bloomington, "Violence begets violence."
<P>
     Studies of the official records of abused children and arrested
offenders put this connection in the range of 14 percent to 26 percent. 
But the connection triples to a range of 50 percent to 70 percent once
researchers go beyond official reports of investigated cases of child abuse
to reports of abuse by the delinquents themselves.
<P>
     Significantly, West Coast Crips and Bloods gang members almost
without exception grew up in dangerous family environments.  Typically,
they left home to escape the violence or drifted away because they were
abandoned or neglected by their parents.  Consequently, these young men
have developed a defensive world view characterized by a feeling of
vulnerability and a need to protect oneself, a belief that no one can be
trusted, a need to maintain social distance, a willingness to use violence and
intimidation to repel others, an attraction to similarly defensive people, and
an expectation that no one will come to their aid.  Young women
delinquents who run away from home are also frequently victims of sexual
abuse.
<P>
     The close connection between child abuse and violent crime is
highlighted also in a 1988 study of the 14 juveniles then condemned to
death in the United States:  12 had been brutally abused, and 5 had been
sodomized by relatives.
<P>
     Child sexual or physical abuse alone can outweigh many other
factors in contributing to violent crime but affects boys and girls differently. 
Abuse visited upon girls is more likely to result in depression (the inversion
of anger) or psychiatric hospitalization than in the more outwardly
directed hostility of abused males.  According to Cathy Spatz Widom,
"Early childhood victimization has demonstrable long-term consequences for
delinquency, adult criminality, and violent behavior.... The experience of
child abuse and neglect has a substantial impact even on individuals with
otherwise little likelihood of engaging in officially recorded criminal
behavior."
<P>
<B> Family Condition Leading to Crime #7:  Criminal Parents </B>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Patterns of crime are transmitted from generation to generation.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     In a longitudinal study of 394 families in England, David P. 
Farrington, professor of criminology at Cambridge University, found that
approximately 4 percent of these families accrued almost half of the
convictions of the entire sample.  "The fact that delinquency is
transmitted from one generation to the next is indisputable.... [F]ewer than
5 percent of the families accounted for almost half of the criminal
convictions in the entire sample.... In order to achieve such concentration of
crime in a small number of families, it is necessary that the parents and the
brothers and sisters of offenders also be unusually likely to commit criminal
acts."
<P>
The findings for England, though dramatic and for a different culture and
country, comport with the earlier U.S.  research as summarized by Professor
Kevin Wright of the State University of New York at Binghamton: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> The Gluecks determined that delinquents were more likely
     than nondelinquents to have delinquent fathers and mothers. 
     Subsequent studies supported the Gluecks' findings,
     observing that delinquent boys were more likely to have
     delinquent or criminal parents.  In a study of the families of
     black delinquents in St.  Louis, Robins found that a child's
     delinquent behavior was associated with 1) arrests of one or
     both of the parents in their adult years, and 2) a history of
     juvenile delinquency on the part of the parents.  Children
     with two parents with criminal histories were at extremely
     high risk of delinquency.</BLOCKQUOTE>
     <P>
     Girls involved in crime tend to mate with (if not marry) men with
criminal records.  Jill Leslie Rosenbaum of California State University,
describing young delinquent women in her study, states:  "[T]he men in the
wards' lives bore a striking resemblance to the men chosen by their mothers. 
Many were significantly older than the girls and had criminal records."

<P>

<B> STAGE TWO:  JUVENILE DELINQUENCY </B>
<P><B> Community Experience Leading to Crime #1:  A Child's Rejection by
Other Children</B> 
<P>
     For most normal children, going to school is their first serious step
into the broader community.  But for future delinquents, this first experience
pushes them further down the spiral toward delinquency and crime. 
Because of their family experiences, these children already are aggressive
and hostile.  Normal, emotionally attached children avoid them -- in
effect isolating and rejecting them.  As a result, they seek compatible
company elsewhere, in a group where they feel they belong.
<P>
     As Ronald Simons, professor of sociology at Iowa State University,
writes, "Ineffective parents produce aggressive first graders who are rejected
by their peers and as a consequence must form friendships with other
deviant youth."  Likewise, Gerald Patterson of the Oregon Social
Learning Center says:  "Poor social skills, characterized by aversive or
coercive interaction styles, lead directly to rejection by normal peers." 
Patterson, the leading expert in this area, also makes the point that peer
rejection tends to be linked to ineffective parenting:  "Specifically, early
parent failures contribute to later skills deficits.... Parent skills in solving
family problems correlate significantly with measures of academic skill and
peer relations."  In a study of 1,224 grade school boys, James D.  Roff,
professor of psychology at Eastern Michigan University, concludes that the
boy at highest risk of becoming delinquent "was characterized by aggressive
behavior in the context of peer rejection."
<P>
     Closed off from the community of their peers, future criminals search
out companions who feel comfortable with them.  Not surprisingly, these
companions are similarly aggressive-hostile children with whom they feel
at ease and by whom they are accepted.  The group thus reinforces its own
aggressive-hostile ways and gradually rejects the conventional ways of
normally attached children.  Continued disruption at home, parents'
continued use of harsh discipline, and the continued absence of a father
all add to the growing hostility of these future delinquents.  Association with
delinquent peers -- almost all of whom come from similar family and
parental backgrounds -- is the next significant development on the path to
habitual crime.
<P>
<B> Community Experience Leading to Crime #2:  Failure at School </B>
<P>
     By the age of five or six, small children who are deprived of parental
love and supervision have become hostile and aggressive and therefore have
greater difficulty forming friendships with normal children.  This hostility
also undermines their school work and success.  Professor David P. 
Farrington's Cambridge University study finds a high correlation between
school adjustment problems and later delinquency:  "Youths who dislike
school and teachers, who do not get involved in school activities, and who
are not committed to educational pursuits are more likely than others to
engage in delinquent behavior."
<P>
     Future criminals tend not to have good verbal memory at school or
the ability to grasp the meaning of concepts, including moral concepts. 
They generally fail to learn reading and computation skills, undermining
their performance in the middle grades.  They often fail in the later grades
and have no or low aspirations for school or work.  They begin to be
truant and eventually drop out of school in their teens.  Typically,
before they drop out of school they already have begun a serious
apprenticeship in crime by having far higher rates of delinquency than do
those who graduate.
<P>
     Once again, all these problems are rooted in unfavorable family
conditions.  In a study on juvenile delinquency, Merry Morash, professor of
criminology at Michigan State University, analyzed four large data sets:  the
British-funded Cambridge Study of Delinquent Development and the U.S. 
federally funded National Longitudinal Study of Youth, National Survey of
Children, and Philadelphia Cohort study.  Examining these four large studies
of the development of children, particularly the connection between home,
education, and crime, she concludes:  "[The] mother's [young] age is related
to delinquency primarily through its association with low hopes for
education, negative school experiences, father absence, and limited
monitoring of the child."
<P>
     Consider the bleak impact of these family conditions on the future
of the education system and the next generation of students.  In the mid-
1980s, the Chancellor of the New York City school system was
complaining:  "We are in a situation now where 12,000 of the 60,000
kindergartners have mothers who are still in their teenage years, and where
40 percent  of our students come from single parent households."  But
since then, the national teenage out-of-wedlock birth rate has grown by 50
percent, from 30 births per 1,000 unmarried teenage girls in 1982 to 45 per
1,000 in 1991.
<P>
<B> Community Experience Leading to Crime #3:  The Growth of the Gang </B>
<P>
     Commenting on the work of all parents as their children enter
adolescence, James Q.  Wilson of UCLA writes: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Affection and monitoring had better have done the job
     already, because the "child-rearing" days are over.  It is time
     to hope for the best.... [A] major feature of recent times is
     the increasing independence of adolescents from the family....
     This independence from the family results in increasing
     dependence of the adolescent on other adolescents.  But
     adolescents cannot take the place of parents as socializing
     agents because they have little or no investment in the
     outcome, and are less likely to recognize deviant
     behavior.</BLOCKQUOTE>
     <P>
     All children, especially during their teenage years, gravitate toward
the influence of their peers.  Not surprisingly, as the professional
literature shows, delinquent peers move a boy in the direction of
delinquency and crime.  The same is true for girls.
<P>
     In the company of their peers, future criminals gradually learn to
exploit the people of their own community, a community to which they feel
no responsibility or obligation.  For these boys, increasingly involved
with delinquent companions, their lives tend to become insulated from the
weakening influence of their families.  Continued weakness in parental
supervision, monitoring, and control invariably escalates the conflict at
home, and this increasing conflict and related family problems cause these
children to deepen their affiliation with delinquent groups, the only class of
people likely to welcome them "with a place to belong to."  While the
children continue their aggressive, hostile, and violent ways, their behavior
also increasingly repels normal, non-aggressive people.  They grow more
familiar and at ease with their delinquent peers.  Dropping out of school
is a natural development. 
<P>
 <B> STAGE THREE:  THE COLLAPSE OF COMMUNITY </B>
<P>
     Criminal youth tend to live in high-crime neighborhoods.  Each
reinforces the other in a destructive relationship, spiraling downward into
violence and social chaos.
<P>
          The 1980s witnessed an extraordinary increase in community
violence in most major American cities.  In 1990, homicide in Boston
increased by over 40 percent over the previous year; in Denver, it rose by
29 percent; in Chicago, Dallas, and New Orleans, by more than 20 percent;
in Los Angeles, by 16 percent; in New York, by 11 percent.  In 1988,
nationwide firearm death rates for all teenagers for the first time exceeded
the total for all other natural causes of death combined, and black male
teens were 11 times more likely than their white counterparts to be killed
by guns. 
<P>
           According to the national survey data, there is a clear
correlation between the surge in criminal violence in these largely urban
communities and the collapse of marriage.  Professional research in
criminology also supports this conclusion.
<P>
          Tragically for these communities, single-parent neighborhoods
tend to be high-crime neighborhoods.  Researchers long ago observed that
violent crime, among both teenagers and adults, is concentrated most heavily
in urban neighborhoods characterized by a very high proportion of single-
parent families.  More recent figures indicate the illegitimate birth rate
in many urban neighborhoods is a staggering 80 percent.  And today's
researchers, like those before them, find that a neighborhood composed
mainly of single-parent families invariably is a chaotic, crime-ridden
community in which assaults are high and the gang -- " the
delinquent subcommunity"-- assumes control.  In these chaotic
conditions, parental supervision of adolescent and pre-adolescent children is
almost impossible.  In turn, children living in these neighborhoods are
more likely to learn, accept, and use physical violence to satisfy their wants
and needs.
<P>
          While serious crime is highest in these socially disorganized,
largely urban neighborhoods, however, its frequency is not a function of
race.  The determining factor is absence of marriage.  Among broken
families, with their chaotic, "dysfunctional" relationships, whether white or
black, the crime rate is very high.  Among married two-parent families,
whether white or black, the crime rate is very low.  The capacity and
determination to maintain stable married relationships, not race, is the
pivotal factor.  The chaotic, broken community stems from these
chaotic, broken families.  The reason race appears to be an important factor
in crime is the wide differences in marriage rates among ethnic groups.
<P>
     While the crime rate among blacks has risen sharply, so has the
disappearance of marriage.  The same holds true for whites.
<P>
     A recent report from the state of Wisconsin further illustrates the
same relationship.
<P>
          A high concentration of broken families without husbands and
fathers is the danger signal for future crime.
<P>
          Violent families, violent youth, and violent communities. 
<P>
Violent youth often come from violent parents.  Violent youth are the most
likely to have witnessed conflict and violence between their parents. 
They also are the most likely to commit serious violent crime and to
become "versatile" criminals -- those engaged in a variety of crimes,
including, theft, fraud, and drugs.  Among these youths, physically or
sexually abused boys commit the most violent offenses.
<P>
          Internal family violence is only one major contributor to
adolescent violence in these socially disorganized neighborhoods.  The
neighborhood itself (which includes the youth's violent peers, also rooted in
their own broken families) is the other powerful contributor, especially
to violent delinquency, and its culture of aggression and violence is
imported into the school.  Consider a recent report from the Centers for
Disease Control:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> More than 4 per cent of high school students in Grades 9-12
     had carried a firearm at least once in the past 30 days, and
     35.5 percent of those had carried six or more times during
     that period.  Thus, about 1.4 percent of high school students
     might be considered regular gun carriers.  Furthermore, more
     than 60 percent of the students surveyed in Baltimore
     reported knowing someone who had carried a gun to
     school.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
          Given the level of violence in their neighborhoods, for young
people to carry guns for self-defense is perhaps understandable.  And
the youth most likely to feel the need for defense is the member of a street
gang in a violent neighborhood.  After he has committed his first violent
crime, the evidence shows that he is likely to commit further crimes and
more than twice as likely as other criminal youths to commit more
violence.  Various studies indicate that violent crime is much more
likely to come to the attention of the police and lead to investigation and
arrest.  For example, Franklyn W.  Dunford and Delbert S.  Elliott of
the Behavioral Research Institute at Boulder, Colorado, find that young
violent criminals are more likely than others to be arrested. 
<P>
           As a result of the low arrest rate for criminals, even the
alarming official crime figures do not give policymakers a true picture of
what is happening in high-crime communities.  According to Dunford and
Elliott, 93 percent of those committing between 100 and 200 offenses
between 1976 and 1978 were not arrested, while 81 percent of the youth
responsible for more than 200 offenses during the same two-year period
were not arrested.  Explains Dunford:  "These data suggest that only those
at the extreme have any risk of arrest, and even that risk is not high.  It
appears that the volume of crime committed by these youth may be such
that arrest is a function of chance alone.  The police may, figuratively, be
stumbling over them.  The likelihood of arrest is close to zero until one
reports in excess of 100 total offenses."  Elsewhere in the same study,
Dunford reports:  "Of the 242 [career criminals] 86 percent had no record
of arrest.  In other words, the overwhelming majority of self-reported career
offenders were never arrested during a three year period when they were
involved in very frequent and serious criminal offenses."
<P>
          Given the very high frequency of undetected crime by career
(expert) criminals, the other dramatic finding from the Cambridge University
study of British delinquents may hold for the United States as well: 
that 50 percent of all crime probably comes from less than 5 percent of the
delinquents' families.
<P>
          The Family versus the "Hood." Two researchers from the
National Institute of Mental Health, John E.  Richters and Pedro Martinez,
have studied families in high-risk inner-city neighborhoods.  Their study
indicates that only 6 percent of children from stable, safe homes become
delinquent.  Meanwhile, 18 percent of children from homes rated as either
unstable or unsafe (broken marriage or lack of supervision) became
delinquent, but 90 percent of children from homes rated as both unstable
and unsafe became delinquent.  Only 10 percent did not.
<P>
          Such studies show that the family is fighting desperately with
the violent neighborhood for the future of its children.  The good news is
that even in violent and crime-ridden neighborhoods, "good families" are
winning the battle, though a 6 percent juvenile delinquency failure rate is
still a tragedy for them.  Even the troubled family is winning, with its 82
percent success rate, though the one-in-five delinquency rate means that
every second family has had a family member in jail.  Remarkably, even 10
percent of children from the most unstable and unsafe families somehow
survive and escape a life of crime.  The 90 percent delinquency rate
among their siblings may be inevitable, for these are the families with the
highest concentration of neglectful and abusive parents who would warp any
child.
     
     <P>

<B> Delinquent Girls </B>
<P>
     The discussion of delinquency generally focuses on boys because
most violent crime is committed by males.  But while male and female
delinquents have similar experiences, the quality of the intimate family
relations of delinquent females often is much worse.  They tend to be even
less attached to, and to have more problems with, their mothers than do
male delinquents.  They are even more firmly rejected by their female
school peers than are their male counterparts.  And, in turn, they are even
more firmly attached to their own "bad companions" -- the delinquent peer
group -- than are males to theirs.
<P>
          Professor Jill Rosenbaum of California State University paints
a graphic picture of the early life of a female delinquent.  The relationship
between family breakdown or disintegration and later criminal status is
dramatic:<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> In 1980, records were requested on 240 women who had
     been committed to the California Youth Authority (CYA),
     the state agency for juvenile offenders.... Family Structure: 
     Very few (seven percent) of these girls came from intact
     homes families.... By the time these girls were 16, their
     mothers had been married an average of four times, and there
     was an average of 4.3 children per family.... Family
     Criminality:  seventy six percent of the girls came from
     families where there was a record of criminality.... Family
     Violence:  Although much data on family violence are
     missing, it is evident that violence was present in many of
     these homes.... Family Conflict:  In the two parent families
     (mainly step families) examined in this study a great deal of
     conflict was present.  Of these parents, 71 percent fought
     regularly about the children.  Since there were often his, hers
     and theirs present, the sources of conflict tended to result
     from one set of children having a bad influence on the
     others, the type of punishment invoked, or one particular
     child receiving too much attention.... Conflict over the use of
     alcohol was present in 81 percent of the homes.... Parent-
     Child Relationships:  A Poor relationship between parent and
     child is highly influential in the child's subsequent
     delinquency.... Many of the girls received very little positive
     feedback from parents in the home.  Of the fathers who were
     present, 53 percent were viewed by parole officers as
     rejecting of the girl, as were 47 percent of the mothers. 
     Rejection came in many forms.... The mothers appeared to be
     not only neglectful, but 96 percent were described as passive
     and 67 percent as irresponsible.... Generational Cycles:  The
     mothers of the CYA wards tend to marry young, with 44%
     having had the ward by the time she was 18.  These
     daughters tended to follow in their mothers' footsteps and
     begin bearing children at an early age.... Parents often
     encouraged this behavior.  One mother explained to her
     daughter's parole officer that she was happy to hear that her
     15-year-old daughter was pregnant --" That is what women
     are supposed to do."...  The men in the wards' lives bore a
     striking resemblance to the men chosen by their mothers. 
     Many were significantly older than the girls and had criminal
     records.... The Mothers:  The wards' mothers did not have
     the supports or resources needed to cope with their
     environments.  They often were socially isolated and
     distrusted those attempting to help.  They viewed welfare
     workers as those trying to take away funds and social
     workers as trying to take away their children.  These attitudes
     and fears began long before the wards were born perhaps
     even before their mothers were born.  The mothers of the
     CYA girls did not know how to be mothers, for they were
     often children themselves when their children were born, and
     lacked the emotional resources to instill a sense of trust and
     security necessary for self esteem and growth.  Over time,
     just trying to survive depleted whatever emotional resources
     they might once have had.</BLOCKQUOTE>
     
<P>
<B> THE SOCIAL CONDITIONS OF A SAFE SOCIETY
</B><P>
     Most ordinary Americans do not need to survey the social science
literature to know that a family life of affection, cohesion, and parental
involvement prevents delinquency.  In particular, they know almost
instinctively that maternal affection, maternal self-confidence, and the
father's esteem for the mother are among the critical elements in raising
well-balanced children.  The literature bears out these common-sense
assumptions.  Most Americans, too, know that in a law-abiding family
the parents encourage the moral development of their children and promote
an understanding and acceptance of traditional moral norms.  Again, the
professional literature reinforces these common-sense maxims.  As Professor
Wright observes:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> The existing literature on the topic [of normative
     development] includes a study by Mak that found that a
     belief in law was negatively associated with several measures
     of delinquency for both boys and girls.  Mak further reported
     that feelings of empathy are inversely related to seriousness,
     vandalism, and assault for girls and cheating and assault for
     boys.  Agnew found that a belief that it is good to be
     honest and to avoid cheating was associated with a reduced
     likelihood of delinquency.  Smith and Paternoster
     discovered that moral beliefs reduced the likelihood of
     marijuana use among both males and females.  Paternoster
     and Triplettobserved that moral beliefs were related to
     both the incidence and prevalence of marijuana use, theft,
     and vandalism.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
          Moreover, most Americans know that this moral development
of children usually is accomplished within the context of religious belief and
practice.  The government's own surveys of the professional literature
confirm this view.  To continue from Professor Wright's review of the
literature for the Justice Department: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Another study found that attachment to church was
     inversely related to violence.  And, finally Tolan found
     that the moral-religious emphasis within the family... was
     related to self-reported delinquency.
     <P>
     Rodney Stark says that delinquency rises or falls in a high
     school to the extent to which the high schools contain a
     majority of religious students.  This fits with the findings
     that among black men incarcerated and those not is that those
     who do not commit crime participated in church activities
     and had friends who went to church.  By contrast those who
     were incarcerated had deviant friends and did not go to
     church.</BLOCKQUOTE>
     
<P>
 <B> The Crucial Elements </B>
<P>
     The root cause of violent crime thus is found in failed intimate
relationships of love in marriage and in the family.  The breakdown of
stable communities into crime-infested neighborhoods flows directly from
this failure.  In contrast, addressing the root causes of crime requires an
understanding of the crucial elements of supportive family and community
life.
<P>
First in importance and influence is the basic marriage commitment.  Its
vital importance is starkly evident in the catastrophic impact of its absence.
<P>
Second is the relationship of love between parents and children, a love
expressed primarily in supervision.
<P>
Third, stemming from the first and second, is the child's ability to relate to
other children.
<P>
Fourth, the backbone of strong neighborhoods, is friendship and cooperation
between families.
<P>
     It is no coincidence that one of the central rules in the traditional
moral codes of all communities at all times, in all places, and in all cultures
is the prohibition against giving birth to children outside of marriage. 
Societies all over the world have recognized that this prohibition is essential
to social stability and to raising members of each new generation with the
proper respect for their community and their peers.  Unfortunately, and with
disastrous consequences, this prohibition is ignored today in American
society at all levels, but most especially in central-city neighborhoods. 
Having a child outside of marriage virtually guarantees a teenage woman
and her children a life of poverty, low education, low expectations, and low
achievement.  It gradually puts in place the conditions which foster rejection
and, ultimately, crime.
<P>
          Whenever there is too high a concentration of such broken
families in any community, that community will disintegrate.  Only so many
dysfunctional families can be sustained before the moral and social fabric
of the community itself breaks down.  Re-establishment of the basic
community code of children within marriage is necessary both for the future
happiness of American families and for a reduction in violent crime.
<P>
          It follows, then, that the real work of reducing violent crime
is the work of rebuilding the family.  Institutions in the community, such as
the church and the school, have demonstrated their importance in helping to
restore stability.  Government agencies, on the other hand, are powerless to
increase marital and parental love; they are powerless to increase or
guarantee care and attention in a family; they are powerless to increase the
ability of adults to make and keep commitments and agreements.  Instead,
thanks to policies that do little to preserve the traditional family and much
to undermine it, government continues to misdiagnose the root cause of
social collapse as an absence of goods and services.  This misdiagnosis is
government's own contribution to the growth of crime.  Having
misdiagnosed, it misleads.
<P>
          There is an irreplaceable role for political leadership in the
current crisis.  It is not to take the place of family and community,
however, but to articulate a compelling, positive vision of the nation in
terms of family and community life.  As President John F.  Kennedy
inspired thousands of young people to serve others overseas, another must
inspire today's youth to rebuild America's families and community.  This
is the work not of government, but of the nation's primary nurturing
institutions:  family, church, and school.  The missions of these institutions
are missions of love and the moral and the spiritual formation of a people.
   <P>       The alternative is continued social disintegration.  
<P>
<B> WHAT GOVERNMENT CAN DO </B>
<P>
Hold hearings on the real causes of crime.
<P>
     Given the disconnect between the assumptions behind the social
spending in the Omnibus Crime Bill of 1994 and the real root causes of
crime, a major correction in thinking is needed.  The Judiciary Committees
of Congress should conduct a series of hearings on the root causes -- the
long-term causes -- of crime.  These should focus on the relationship of
family structure, and particularly of marriage and religious practice, to the
prevention of violent crime.  The literature, the scholarship, and particularly
the experience are wide and deep.
<P>
Conduct a serious review of all national social programs.
<P>
     Congress ought to conduct a comprehensive review of all national
social programs, inviting the director of each program to present the
evaluation data on the program's effectiveness (or lack of it) in reducing
crime.
<P>
Commission geographical mapping of social problems and their related
conditions.
<P>
Congress should require the Departments of Health and Human Services,
Justice, Labor, and Commerce to provide it with geographical mapping of
the conditions known to be related to crime and other social problems. 
Among the problem indices that should be mapped:
<P>
The different types of crime;<BR>
Drug use;<BR>
Long-term welfare dependency (over two years);<BR>
School performance;<BR>
Out-of-wedlock births;<BR>
Domestic violence, by types;<BR>
Child abuse;<BR>
Sexually transmitted diseases, including AIDS.
<P>
     Congress also should require information to examine the relationships
between other social indicators and the lack of crime.  Among the social
strengths that should be mapped:
<P>
Presence of intact primary marriages (comparing these with alternative
family structures, from blended families of different types to different forms
of single-parent families);
<P>
Attendance of adults and children at religious institutions;
<P>
Religious education indices (attendance at religion-based schools and at
supplementary religion classes);
<P>
Volunteer activity in social service associations.
By mapping at the smallest geographical unit possible (county, zip code, or
even smaller), many research benefits can be derived.
<P>
Request research on the effects on children of the intergenerational
transmission of the single-parent family structure.
<P>
     Congress ought to request summary descriptive and comparative
research on how the children of first, second, third, and fourth generation
single-parent families fare on indices of health and development, as well as
social competence, during and by the end of their growing years.  While we
do have some knowledge of the impact of out-of-wedlock birth and
single-parent family life on children, we do not know about multiple-
generation effects.  This knowledge could be very salutary.
<P>
Reform the welfare system.
<P>
     Welfare today is a destructive Faustian bargain between all potential
mothers and the government.  As the condition for receiving cash -- as
opposed to real community support -- the system requires that women and
girls abandon the traditional moral code.  Explains Heritage Foundation
Senior Policy Analyst Robert Rector:  "The woman has a contract with the
government:  She will continue to receive her 'paycheck' as long as she
fulfills two conditions:  1) She must not work; and 2) She must not marry
an employed male."
<P>
     Whatever good intentions were served by the welfare system, the
evidence shows that its perverse financial incentives discourage the
formation of intact families and the pursuit of work.  These are the
outcomes of the current "community code" on which high-crime
neighborhoods are built.  Thus, current government policy is a powerful
facilitator of the long-term rise in the crime rate.
<P>
     Legislation is needed to end the destructive features of the welfare
system.  Instead of sending paychecks to single mothers, such a reformed
system should channel money to local institutions and levels of government
that can pull the mother toward helping groups in the community and pull
the community toward the mother and child in need of help.
<P>
     Legislation introduced by Senator Lauch Faircloth (R-NC) and
Representative James Talent (R-MO) (S.2134 and H.R.4566) in the 103rd
Congress takes these necessary steps and would foster a different community
code.  Money now used to support these broken and unformed families
could be given instead to the local community to allow it to decide how best
to help families in need, including newly formed, father-abandoned
families.  The community could disburse this money, at its discretion,
to organizations committed to rebuilding the lives of these broken families.
<P>
Promote -- through leadership in ideas, not national funding --
volunteer community efforts, including the efforts of religious
institutions.
<P>
     Amid the social collapse of so many urban neighborhoods, there are
stunning examples of successful efforts to turn around the lives of young
people previously immersed in crime.  These efforts invariably possess two
features.  One is a strong system of rules within an organization
characterized by the love and firm guidance seen in a supportive family. 
The other is a strong spiritual dimension, most commonly a profound
religious commitment. 
<P>
      Examples of this type of program abound.
<P>
     Example:  Leon Watkins of South Central Los Angeles, convinced
that gangs fill a void for those who join them, helps them do it in a way
that bridges to society.  According to Watkins, being in a gang is like a
religious commitment; there are codes of conduct and service to a higher
good than oneself:  the gang itself.  Watkins shows gang members how to
be true to all that attracts them to the gang and yet be true to themselves
and society around them.  The spiritual inspiration behind all his efforts
becomes clear to the youth.  They learn how to become aware of the
spiritual dimension of their lives.
<P>
     Example:  The Reverend Lee Earl started a church in one of the
most desolate sections of Detroit, a neighborhood whose economy was built
on drugs, prostitution, and welfare.  Within a decade the same neighborhood
and the same inhabitants, under the inspiration of the spiritual leadership of
Rev.  Earl, motivated by a trust in God, had rebuilt their community.  They
became married families, started small businesses, and rebuilt and bought
out their own homes.  Crime plummeted and a community was reborn.
<P>
     Giving people a place to belong and hope in a future, hope
communicated through inspiring leadership, is common to all these
successes.  Giving a neglected child a place to belong -- someone to belong
to -- is communicated through the spirit of a giving person, something
beyond social work alone.  It involves a long-term personal relationship with
a child.  These relationships do not take money, but they do take a generous
commitment of personal time, as in Big Brothers and Big Sisters. 
Government cannot purchase these efforts.  If it tries, it will vitiate them by
turning moral relationships into monetary ones.
<P>
Promote, through leadership in ideas, the benefits to the nation of
regular worship at religious institutions.
<P>
     The importance of codes of conduct and religious practice can hardly
be overstated.  According to the professional literature, active participation
in a church significantly correlates with decreased incidence of crime. 
Expansion of active church membership and religious worship in a
community contributes to the reduction of crime.
<P>
     Government cannot re-empower religious institutions, for their
essential nature is moral and spiritual.  But it can be less hostile to their
traditional areas of competence and mission.  The potential for good among
many religiously inspired schools, especially in America's inner cities, is
well-known.  But Congress and the courts insist that the price of
government cooperation in education is noncooperation among the three
nurturing institutions of family, church, and school.  This strategy weakens
communities.
<P>
Conduct inner-city experiments with school vouchers.
<P>
     Schools that maintain discipline and strong moral values can help
support families that value these virtues and may make a difference in
communities that have broken down.  Parents need to be able to select such
schools when their children are at risk.  To give parents this choice, states
and localities can be encouraged to offer vouchers to lower-income families. 
So far states have resisted conducting these experiments.  The federal
government ought to finance and evaluate six to twelve such local
demonstrations.
<P>
     Recent poll data in California and New Jersey confirm the general
pattern of support for vouchers:  not surprisingly, it is the poor who most
want vouchers for private schools for their children.  The poor well
understand the importance of good schools in giving young people in crime-
ridden neighborhoods the chance for a productive life.  Private and religious
schools have the major advantage of being able to instill and enforce a
moral code for teachers, children, and parents.  This is just the help that
parents in fragile, crime-ridden communities desperately need.  In the battle
between the family and the "Hood," such schools can be crucial allies for
parents.  Vouchers provide the constitutional and financial means for this
close and effective cooperation between school and family in the moral
formation of children.
<P>
Remove barriers to adoption.
<P>
     Many children would have the benefit of a stable, two-parent family
-- reducing the probability that they would descend into crime -- if adoption
were made easier.  Unfortunately, there are many frustrating barriers to
adoption. 
<P>
      The largest barrier is the ethos of the social services establishment,
which discourages adoption as the preferred option for a young unmarried
mother and her child.  The best way to deal with this is to provide
competition by allowing other institutions to provide adoption services.  One
of the best competitors could be the nation's churches, which have great
outreach to young pregnant women and to couples desiring to adopt.  Black
churches are particularly well poised to perform this function and are likely
to take care of balancing the needs of the child in racial matching of the
parents where possible while also ensuring a speedy adoption, no matter
who the parents are.  However, liability law needs to be changed to remove
obstacles to churches, particularly small churches, wishing to provide this
natural form of charity.
<P>
Reduce taxes on marriage and children.
<P>
     The federal tax code discriminates against the institution of marriage
and the raising of children.  Since the early 1950s, the tax system each year
has increased the tax burden at a much faster rate on families raising
children than on any other form of household.  Talk of "family" values
is largely meaningless if it does not address this central economic
relationship between government and family, a relationship that will always
be there, no matter the levels of social problems.  A government intent on
doing its limited best in the long-term prevention of crime will adjust its tax
code to reflect the fundamental importance of stable marriage to the social
order.
<P>
     The federal government can and should reform features of the tax
code that hurt families with children -- particularly low-income working
families.  One such egregious feature is the "marriage penalty" on fathers
and mothers who move from cohabitation to married family status.  Another
step Congress can take is to enact tax credits or other tax relief for parents
with children.  Adjusting the tax system to benefit the intact family silently
but powerfully upholds marriage and the family.
<P>
<B> CONCLUSION </B>
<P>
     The professional literature of criminology is surprisingly consistent
on the real root causes of violent crime:  the breakdown of the family and
community stability.  The sequence has its deepest roots in the absence of
stable marriage.
<P>
          Despite the good news that overall crime rates have dropped
in recent years, the frightening news is that both the level and viciousness
of teenage violent crime have been rising steadily.  More ominous still, this
was set in motion sixteen to eighteen years ago, when these violent
teenagers were born into chaotic family and social conditions.  Since then
these conditions have become more prevalent, and we will see a continued
rise in violent teenage crime.  Furthermore, America is headed toward a 50
percent out-of-wedlock birthrate sometime in the next twelve to twenty
years, inching more and more of the country closer to today's inner-city
illegitimacy rate.  If this trend is not reversed, Americans must prepare for
extensive and serious erosion of public safety and practical freedoms.
<P>
          Government can staff and manage the criminal justice system
efficiently and prevent crime in the short term by locking up violent teenage
criminals so that they are no longer a danger to others.  But it lacks both the
capacity and competence to tackle the root causes of crime.  That is the
mission of three other basic institutions of society:  the family, the church,
and the school.  For close to five decades government has increasingly
burdened these institutions -- has even become hostile to them.  It is now
time to help these institutions fulfill their missions by reversing course and
removing these burdens.
<P>
     However, it will take real leadership -- leadership through ideas and
passionately meant words -- to inspire us all to cooperate in rebuilding our
marriages, families, neighborhoods, and communities. That is the appropriate
work for America's political leaders and statesmen.

<P><hr width=50%></center>
<P>


<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Clinton Administration continues to retreat in the war on drugs. After a decade of consistent progress during the Reagan and Bush Administrations, almost every available indicator today shows the United States is losing -- some would say surrendering -- in the prolonged struggle against illegal drugs. Consider the evidence:
<p><ul>
<li> Since President Clinton took office, the number of 12-to-17-year-olds using marijuana has almost doubled -- 2.9 million compared with the 1992 level of 1.6 million.<sup>3</sup>  One in three high school seniors now smokes marijuana, and 48.4 percent of the Class of 1995 had tried drugs by graduation day.<sup>4</sup>
<p>
<li> LSD use has reached the highest rate since recordkeeping started in 1975. Fully 11.7 percent of the Class of 1995 had tried it at least once.<sup>5</sup>
<p>
<li> The number of cocaine- and heroin-related emergency room admissions has jumped to historic levels. In the first half of 1995, cocaine-related emergency room cases were 65 percent above the level in the first half of 1991. Heroin admissions soared 120 percent over the same period.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
<li> Methamphetamine use has turned into a major problem, particularly in the western United States. In the first half of 1995, meth-related emergency room cases were up by 321 percent compared with the first half of 1991.<sup>7</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While there are many different reasons for this deterioration in America's resistance to illegal drugs, part of the explanation is a failure in federal policy. President Clinton and his Administration have demonstrated little leadership on the issue and have failed to send out an unambiguous message of disapproval to young Americans. The President's personnel appointments in this area have ranged from the virtually invisible, as in the case of former "drug czar" Lee Brown, to the embarrassing, as in the case of Dr. Joycelyn Elders, former Surgeon General of the United States. Staffing at the Office of National Drug Control Policy was cut by 80 percent -- from 147 to 25. Moreover, although the President's election year budget reverses this cut and requests major increases for drug law enforcement, his FY 1995 request would have eliminated 621 drug enforcement positions.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Clinton Administration's policy initiatives have been similarly ineffectual, especially their focus on hard core drug users at the expense of stronger law enforcement and interdiction. The evidence is in: Federal illegal drug caseloads fell by 10.3 percent from FY 1992 to FY 1995; the government-wide interdiction budget has been cut 39 percent since 1993; the impact of interdiction programs has dropped off sharply; and drug-related hospital emergency room admissions have hit record levels.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Instead of pursuing ineffectual anti-drug policies and giving the impression that curbing drug use is not a priority, the President and Congress should demonstrate leadership in this deadly contest. If the United States is serious about combating the infiltration of illegal drugs across America's borders and into the nation's cities, towns, neighborhoods, and schools, several steps need to be taken: 
<p><ul>
<li> The President must use the "bully pulpit" of his office to send out a clear message that drug use is unacceptable.
<p>
<li> America must assist its allies in Latin America and elsewhere in their efforts to take on the drug cartels.
<p>
<li> President must propose budgetary, personnel, and policy initiatives that make it absolutely clear that Washington means business in curbing the flow of drugs into America. 
<p>
<li>Congress should pass legislation to close loopholes that result in excessively lenient sentences for marijuana smugglers.
<p>
<li> Congress should continue to block the United States Sentencing Commission's proposals to lower sentences for crack cocaine dealers. 
<p>
<li> Washington must get serious about promoting rehabilitation that works, such as religion-based programs, instead of simply funding programs that promise to rehabilitate drug addicts and fail to deliver. Congress should re-evaluate all treatment programs carefully. The basis of federal funding for drug rehabilitation should be a clear track record of success.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
America succeeded in reducing the rate of drug use, especially among vulnerable teenagers, in the 1980s because local efforts were reinforced by a serious program of law enforcement, interdiction, and hard-headed demand reduction policies, and because the Reagan and Bush Administrations made it very clear that they were determined to win the war against drugs. Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration has adopted a very different posture, and America is now losing the war. 

<p>
<b>THE FAILURE OF LEADERSHIP</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The illegal drug problem is admittedly complex, but complexity is no excuse for inaction. President Clinton began derailing the successful approaches of prior administrations from the earliest days of his presidency. After promising to "reinvent our drug control programs" and "move beyond ideological debates," the President announced a new approach to drug policy, de-emphasizing law enforcement and effecting a "controlled shift" away from interdiction. More important, in a message to Congress, he promised to "change the focus of drug policy by targeting chronic, hardcore drug users."<sup>8</sup>  This ineffectual policy -- the latest manifestation of the liberals' commitment to a "therapeutic state" in which government serves as the agent of personal rehabilitation -- seems to have been rejected even by the President's new drug czar, General Barry McCaffrey, who has moved to elevate the profile of prevention programs.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Cuts in the interdiction system and the dismantling of other programs with records of success have been accompanied by the increased availability of drugs. Ironically, as illustrated in Figure 3, the Clinton drug policy has been most harmful to its intended beneficiaries -- the very hard-core drug addicts who are cycling through emergency rooms at record rates.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The President's lack of visibility on the drug issue has drawn criticism from prominent congressional supporters of drug control programs, including leading Democrats in the House and Senate. Senator Joseph Biden (D-DE) admits he has "been openly critical of this President's silence."<sup>9</sup>  And Representative Charles Rangel (D-NY) has gone so far as to declare, "I've been in Congress over two decades, and I have never, never, never found any Administration that's been so silent on this great challenge to the American people."<sup>10</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In fact, since taking office, President Clinton has been significantly engaged in only one aspect of the drug problem -- drugs in schools, which arguably is not even the federal government's responsibility. In June 1995, Clinton promised to veto any attempt by the 104th Congress to cut the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities program, which Congress had evaluated and found to be ineffective. Bob Peterson, former Michigan drug czar, described the program as a "slush fund," and even former ONDCP Director Lee Brown acknowledged "abuses of the program" in testimony before a House subcommittee.<sup>11</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>The Disturbing Change in the Trends.</b> During the 1980s and early 1990s, the United States experienced dramatic reductions in casual drug use -- reductions that were won through increased penalties, strong presidential leadership, and a clear national anti-drug message. Beyond the substantial investment of resources, engaged commanders in chief used the bully pulpit to change attitudes. Because Ronald Reagan and George Bush visibly involved themselves in the effort to combat illegal drugs, they helped rescue much of a generation. Overall, casual drug use was cut by more than half between 1977 and 1992. Casual cocaine use fell by 79 percent, while monthly use fell from 2.9 million users in 1988 to 1.3 million in 1992.<sup>12</sup>  Strong presidential leadership had tangible effects.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Against this backdrop of accomplishment, Bill Clinton promised to get even tougher than his predecessors. Indeed, while campaigning for the presidency, then-Governor Clinton appeared to take an even harder line on illegal drugs than Bush, declaring that "President Bush hasn't fought a real war on crime and drugs ... [and] I will."  On the link between drugs and crime, Clinton said, "We have a national problem on our hands that requires a tough national response."<sup>13</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Despite the tough rhetoric, however, the President's performance has been disappointing. Perhaps the first solid indication that rhetoric and reality would not fit neatly in the same policy box was the appointment of Dr. Joycelyn Elders of Arkansas as Surgeon General of the United States. Dr. Elders, among other things, offered the taxpayers the tantalizing theory that legalization of drugs might "markedly reduce our crime rate" without increasing drug use.<sup>14</sup>  As for the President himself, his image of rhetorical toughness was compromised on occasion by remarks that could at best be described as indifferent, at worst as flippant.<sup>15</sup>
<p>
<b>DOWNGRADING THE WAR ON DRUGS</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The President's ill-considered public words have been accompanied by a reduction in tangible resources and effort. Within weeks of taking office, the Clinton Administration announced that it would slash the Office of National Drug Control Policy staff from 147 to 25. The President made the Director of the Office a member of the Cabinet, but the move was empty symbolism. This became painfully evident when his new Director, former New York City Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown, was observed to be virtually invisible during his two-and-one-half-year tenure. President Bush's Drug Policy Director, William Bennett, told Congress that the Clinton Administration cuts essentially would relegate the new Director to the position of an office clerk.<sup>16</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Cuts in the drug czar's office prefigured much larger cuts in federal enforcement and interdiction agencies. The Administration's fiscal 1995 budget, for example, proposed to slash 621 drug enforcement positions from the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS), Customs Service, FBI, and Coast Guard.<sup>17</sup>  The DEA, America's only law enforcement agency dedicated exclusively to fighting the drug trade, lost 227 agent positions between September 1992 and September 1995 -- more than 6 percent of its agent force.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Declining Caseloads.</b> Cuts in law enforcement paralleled reduced drug case filings. As illustrated in Chart 4, the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts registered a 10.3 percent reduction in federal case filings between FY 1992 and FY 1995, and the total number of defendants indicted in these cases declined by 8.5 percent. The number of federal drug cases refused for prosecution increased by 18.6 percent over the same period as U.S. Attorneys pursued more investigations into health-care fraud and other areas deemed to be of greater priority than combating illegal drugs (Chart 5).
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In an April 26, 1995, letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin G. Hatch (R-UT), then-Drug Policy Director Lee Brown attributed the "troubling" decline in prosecutions to "the policies of the new U.S. Attorneys who de-emphasized prosecution of small-scale drug offenders."  Director Brown also quoted the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts to the effect that the change had been "consistent with DOJ policy."
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Despite the abundance of data confirming the declining trend in illegal drug prosecutions, Clinton Administration officials have cited different figures, compiled by the Executive Office of U.S. Attorneys, to suggest that case filings and defendants prosecuted actually rose 12.9 and 12.1 percent, respectively, between fiscal 1994 and fiscal 1995 (see Chart 6). But even according to these figures, the number of drug defendants prosecuted dropped for the three years prior to 1995, and remains 5.2 percent below the FY 1992 level.<sup>18</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

In a textbook illustration of the laxness of Clinton Administration drug policy, the <I>Los Angeles Times</I> revealed on May 12, 1996, that hundreds of marijuana smugglers "have been allowed to go free after U.S. authorities arrested them with substantial quantities of drugs at ports of entry in California."<sup>19</sup>  Attorney General Janet Reno objected to the article's claims, noting that the individuals in question are "punished" by having their border crossing cards confiscated. Ms. Reno added that prosecution may be "deferred" only if five mitigating factors are present, a claim that elicited this reaction from Bush Administration Drug Enforcement Administration head Robert C. Bonner:
<p><ul>
<li>	Reno claims that only Mexican nationals qualify under the leniency policy. This results in two standards of justice. U.S. citizens are prosecuted, but Mexican nationals get a free ride to Mexico.
<p>
	<li>Another criterion is being caught with under 125 pounds of marijuana. So, if you are smuggling "only" 100 pounds, with a wholesale value of over $100,000, you meet one of the criteria.
<P>
	<li>Now, Reno also says that there must also be "insufficient evidence" of knowledge and intent, but, of course, no one should be prosecuted, regardless of citizenship or quantity, if evidence of knowledge and intent are not present.<sup>20</sup>
</ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Dropping the Safeguards. </b> The Clinton Administration began to reduce America's drug interdiction efforts within a year of the inaugural. On November 3, 1993, against the vehement objections of senior Coast Guard officers, the National Security Council issued a classified presidential memorandum dictating a "controlled shift" of interdiction assets to other functions. At the same time, flight hours in the so-called "transit zone" between the United States and South America were cut by 50 percent, many interdiction aircraft and helicopters were put into mothballs, ship "steaming days" were cut by a third, and <a href="http://www.dtic.mil/defenselink/">Department of Defense</a> detection and monitoring budgets were reduced by more than half. Controlling for inflation, the aggregate government-wide drug interdiction budget has been cut 39 percent since the last year of the Bush Administration (see Chart 7).<sup>21</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The impact of these cuts was almost immediate: As Chart 8 illustrates, between 1993 and 1994, U.S. interdiction forces experienced a 47 percent drop in their ability to stop drug shipments from Latin America. Cocaine seizures by the Customs Service and the Coast Guard fell by 70 percent and 71 percent, respectively, during the same period.<sup>22</sup>  Overall interdiction effectiveness has dropped by a cumulative 64 percent between 1993 and 1996.<sup>23</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Some, including General McCaffrey, have attempted to argue, against the evidence, that this reduced effectiveness was the result of changing trafficker routes, not vastly diminished levels of national effort. This argument is refuted by an interdiction study commissioned by the Clinton Administration itself. The study, performed for the Office of National Drug Control Policy by the EBR Corporation, using conservative assumptions, showed that restoring $500 million in assets to the transit zone could cause seizures, jettisons, and mission-aborts totaling 130 tons of cocaine per year. In round terms, this means that restoring half the assets cut by the Clinton Administration could result in the seizure or disruption of more than the entire amount of cocaine seized domestically every year.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Stimulating Demand. </b> Cuts in interdiction and law enforcement have had additional consequences that should have been predictable to anyone with even a modicum of understanding of the basic economic laws of supply and demand. As illustrated in Chart 9, between 1993 and 1994 -- the first year of the "controlled shift" away from interdiction -- the retail price of a gram of cocaine dropped from $123 to $104. Two years later, the price was still a low $107 per gram. Heroin prices have fallen even more sharply, from $1,647 per pure gram in 1992 to $966 per gram in February 1996.<sup>24</sup>  The increased availability of such relatively cheap drugs has helped drive hard-core drug use -- as reflected in emergency room admissions -- to record levels.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While most drugs are produced in inaccessible regions overseas, limiting the impact of U.S.-sponsored eradication programs, the bulk of the marijuana consumed in the United States is produced domestically. Domestic marijuana eradication under the Bush Administration was highly successful -- so successful, in fact, that marijuana became more expensive, ounce for ounce, than gold. Hawaiian producers were forced to import marijuana to satisfy local demand for the first time in recent history. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Clinton Administration, however, has deemphasized marijuana eradication. As shown in Chart 10, there has been a 59 percent reduction in cultivated plants destroyed since 1992.<sup>25</sup>  The drug budget of the U.S. Park Service has been cut 22 percent from the FY 1992 level,<sup>26</sup> resulting in a 47 percent reduction in plants eradicated by the Park Service. Once again, increases in supply have fueled demand (use by 8th graders has increased 184 percent since 1992) and caused prices to drop (marijuana prices are at the lowest level in eight years). 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The ubiquitous availability of illegal drugs -- <I>de facto</I> legalization -- is confirmed by the Administration's own data. According to the latest White House report on drug use,<sup>27</sup> heroin is now so cheap and pure that it has "driven new demand and drawn some former addicts back into use."  Meanwhile, the availability of cocaine and crack is described as "high," and marijuana is "plentiful and potent" and "widely available" in all areas of the country except California.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

By making drugs more expensive, aggressive interdiction and law enforcement efforts reduce use among particularly vulnerable inner-city populations by forcing addicts to spend their limited disposable income on a smaller quantity of drugs.<sup>28</sup>  A cocaine addict named "Joe," interviewed for a book<sup>29</sup> on the impact of cocaine, describes the phenomenon: "What keeps you from dying is you run out of money."  Conversely, paring back supply reduction programs hits hardest those who are most heavily addicted and least able to resist drug use.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Rising Emergency Room Cases.</b> This phenomenon is evident in the record number of drug-related emergency room admissions that have followed in the wake of the Clinton Administration's cuts to enforcement and interdiction programs. (It is instructive that these record increases have occurred despite the Clinton strategy's stated concern for hard-core addicts, the primary population captured by the emergency room statistics.) Compared with the first half of 1994 (which was then the high water mark for drug-related emergency room cases), cocaine-related emergencies have increased 12 percent (from 68,400 to 76,800); heroin-related episodes have risen 27 percent (from 30,000 to 38,100); marijuana-related episodes have increased 32 percent (from 19,100 to 25,200); and methamphetamine cases have jumped by a staggering 35 percent (from 7,800 to 10,600).
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Hard-core addicts deserve access to treatment, but experience teaches that the typical addict will cycle through the treatment system several times over a period of years before getting off drugs, with many never reaching that goal. A 1994 RAND study found that only 13 percent of heavy cocaine users who receive treatment are either non-users or light users at the end of a year. The study also found that 20 percent of heavy users continue to use drugs while in treatment.<sup>30</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Getting serious about hard-core drug use ultimately requires America to do more to fight youthful drug use: While hard-core users are mostly beyond the reach of drug treatment professionals, today's young people can be dissuaded from going down the road that leads to hard-core addiction. In fact, those who reach age 21 without using drugs almost never try them later in life. Conversely, drug users almost always start young, and almost invariably by smoking marijuana.<sup>31</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>An About Face? </b> With U.S. Army General Barry McCaffrey's appointment as the new point man on drugs, the President indicated he was reversing his decision to gut ONDCP and discarding his misguided strategy of targeting hard-core users. The editors of <I>The Washington Post</I> called the change an "about face."  President Clinton was able to capitalize on the installation of a tough-minded general; White House aide Rahm Emmanuel was candid enough to say that the changes were "what the President believes will help us improve on our record."<sup>32</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Given the Clinton Administration's previous track record, however, it remains unclear whether Director McCaffrey's appointment means a genuine change in course. His is a managerial position that accords him little line authority, and his policy accomplishments will depend largely on his willingness and ability to take on the various empires of the federal bureaucracy. This in turn will depend on the degree to which he is supported by the President of the United States. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Unfortunately, early indications suggest that Director McCaffrey may be reticent to test the President's commitment to an effective anti-drug strategy. For instance, McCaffrey recently sided with the Department of State in supporting a determination that Mexico had "cooperated fully" with the United States on drug control matters, even though the head of the DEA objected that the government of Mexico had not done enough to warrant that designation. This determination was made even though the Administration could have waived the sanctions that typically accompany decertification. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

This decision sounds a disturbing signal about the degree of General McCaffrey's leverage on drug questions. The United States imports 400 tons of cocaine annually, 70 percent of it transshipped through Mexico. Yet Mexico's seizures have slumped to roughly one-twentieth of the amount passing through their country. Arrest figures are down significantly, and the former president's brother, Raul Salinas, has been arrested on suspicion of "drug-related charges."  Four Mexican trafficking "confederations," meanwhile, operate with relative impunity. But President Clinton's statement to Congress explained away Mexican inaction on the peso crisis and declared weakly that President Zedillo's administration has "set the stage for action against the major drug cartels in Mexico."<sup>33</sup>  For too long, the U.S. has accepted at face value repeated Mexican promises of future aggressive action against the drug trade. It is time for such complacency to end.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

McCaffrey also appears to have had little positive impact on recent high-level appointments. For example, on June 12, 1996, Patricia M. McMahon was nominated to serve as his Deputy Director for Demand Reduction, a post that requires Senate confirmation. A former Clinton campaign worker with little substantive background in drug policy, Ms. McMahon's appointment to a lower-level position was criticized by the <I>Washington Post</I> in the early days of the Clinton Administration as "an example of continued political patronage."<sup>34</sup>  Her principal contribution to the White House drug office was to serve as the political operative who carried out the slashing of the staff by 80 percent at the start of the Administration.
<p>
<b>THE COMPONENTS OF A NEW ANTI-DRUG POLICY </b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The President and Congress can retake the initiative in the continuing struggle against drug use and the agents of the criminal network that is exporting poison into America's neighborhoods. But this cannot happen without the full leadership of the President and his Administration. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	 The Administration must take several decisive steps:
<p><ol>
<b><li>Use the bully pulpit.</b> When President George Bush gave the first national primetime address of his presidency, it was on the drug issue. By doing this, he followed the example of visible and emphatic national leadership set by President Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan. The national effort against drugs -- carried on by parents, young people, local religious leaders, neighbors, local law enforcement, educators, medical personnel, and local government officials -- gains immeasurably from strong, visible presidential support. But it is weakened considerably by the perception of presidential indifference. 
<p>
<b><li> Do more in Latin America.</b> Fighting drugs at the source makes sense. Federal authorities ought to be going after the beehive, not just the bees. Foreign programs are also cheap and effective.

<p>An example: America's chronically underfunded program in Peru will cost just $16 million to run in FY 1996. But targeting even that meager amount effectively can work. The Peruvians have managed to shoot down or disable 20 trafficker airplanes since March 1, 1995. Unfortunately Peruvian President Fujimori's aggressive line on drugs actually caused President Clinton to bar Peru from receiving radar tracking data. That decision has badly damaged Peruvian-American relations, but Fujimori has continued to work with the United States, and much more can be done at very small cost. The Peruvian air force currently uses obsolete A-37 jet trainers from the 1950s. For $50 million, the United States could equip the Peruvians with new tracker aircraft, improved night-flying gear, and spare parts. This is an opportunity to save American lives by helping the Peruvians press their attack on traffickers. In addition to helping countries like Peru, the United States should make effective cooperation in fighting drugs one of the most important requirements for Latin nations seeking good diplomatic and economic relations.
<p>
<b><li> Set more sensible budget priorities.</b> The Department of Defense today is allowed to spend only 0.3 percent of its budget on preventing the inflow of drugs. The U.S. military cannot solve the drug problem, but it can make a profound contribution to cutting the flow of drugs through interdiction. The budget needs to reflect this national priority.
<p>
<b><li> Reduce marijuana availability.</b> The federal government urgently needs to restore leadership to the fight against marijuana production, trafficking, and use. Federal marijuana penalties need to be stiffened, partly by eliminating the loophole that allows marijuana smugglers to be treated far more leniently than marijuana growers. Federal eradication efforts need to be reinvigorated.
<p>
<b><li> Block lower crack sentences.</b> Last year, the United States Sentencing Commission proposed steep reductions in sentences for crack dealers. Those changes were blocked by statute. In its 1997 amendments cycle, the Sentencing Commission is expected again to propose changes. Irresponsible public policy proposals by the Sentencing Commission should be blocked, and the Commission should be barred from proposing changes in criminal penalties where Congress has established mandatory minimum sentences, except in an advisory format that would require affirmative congressional action before taking effect.
<p>
<b><li> Stop undercutting those drug treatment programs that do work.</b> Taxpayers have heard the stories about waiting lists for drug treatment. Waiting lists are not fiction -- they do exist. On the other hand, one program that rarely has waiting lists is Mitch Rosenthal's well-regarded Phoenix House, a tough program where addicts spend 18-24 months literally learning to live new lives. Programs like Phoenix House have a proven track record dating back to 1967. But they are unpopular with addicts because, to quote one analyst, "a residential program with constricted freedom, rigorous rules, and enforced separation from drugs is the last place most addicts want to find themselves, at least initially."35  Nevertheless, these approaches work. Yet taxpayers today pay billions of dollars on drug treatment that allows the addicts to decide for themselves how rigorous and how long their treatment will be. Not surprisingly, this arrangement does not work very well. 
<p>
In addition, while many faith-based treatment programs report remarkable success with the addicted, their religious character usually bars them from receiving government treatment funds. In a break from current policy, Representatives Jim Talent (R-MO) and J.C. Watts (R-OK) have introduced a bill, the American Community Renewal Act of 1996 (<a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3467:">HR 3467</a>), which would allow neighborhood groups, including religious institutions, the same access to federal funds that is enjoyed by other drug treatment and counseling facilities. States also would be able to contract with these drug treatment centers. Discrimination against effective religiously based programs should end.Taxpayer funding for drug treatment should be tied strictly to results, religiously based programs should be eligible for funding, and addicts who seek publicly funded treatment should be required to enter rigorous programs and face real sanctions if they fail to complete them.
</ol><P>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Clinton Administration has a poor record in fighting the war on drugs. Interdiction efforts and prosecution for illegal drugs are down, illegal drug usage and emergency room admissions are up, and there has been an absence of credible presidential leadership on this issue. Part of the problem also has been a failure in personnel management: the inability or unwillingness to appoint effective leaders in key positions to articulate and enforce a strong anti-drug message, as well as inappropriate reductions in staff at agencies dedicated to dealing with the problem on the front lines. With the appointment of General Barry McCaffrey as Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, this situation may improve, although the McMahon appointment is far from encouraging. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

American taxpayers need and deserve presidential leadership on this issue. Members of Congress also need to focus federal efforts on law enforcement and interdiction programs that work, and fund only those rehabilitation programs that have a track record of success. One way Congress can do this is to allow funding for drug counseling and drug rehabilitation programs provided by religious organizations. Congress and the states also should undertake a tough re-evaluation of existing grant recipients to make sure that funding is going to programs that work best in reducing dependency on illegal drugs. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

America's illegal drug problem is complex and presents a special challenge for policymakers in Congress and the White House. But the complexity and the difficulty of the issue are no excuse for ineffective policy and a lack of serious effort.

Please, Mr. President and Congress, A Shorter Campaign Next Time</CENTER>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Never have so many politicians </B>worked so hard and spent
so much to achieve so little change. With the White House still in Democratic
hands, Congress still Republican and exactly the same partisan division
of governors, the nation's politics are roughly where they were a year and
a half ago when history's longest presidential campaign began. What was
achieved? Altogether, marathon fundraising and organizing and advertising
achieved a great record <B><I>low</I></B> turnout, 49 percent. <BR>
<BR>
The result of the voters' collective mixed message was, give us more of
the same. What each voter was saying was more complex, of course. But surely
there is one point on which we each might agree: This thing went on far
too long. <BR>
<BR>
Fourteen months ago I wrote in this space that bunching the presidential
primaries together and &quot;front loading&quot; them in the winter and
early spring of 1996 would prolong the campaign agony for citizens as well
as candidates. No wonder the mood by election day was one of embarrassment
approaching nausea in many voters, and stunned apathy in the rest. By the
end my neighbors were muttering that they wished they had gone away on vacation.
Friends said they were tempted to lock themselves in their houses, disconnect
the television and take up meditation--or worse. Some may have been driven
mad; they haven't been seen in weeks, and certainly didn't show up at the
polls. <BR>
<BR>
It customarily is said that the voters don't start paying attention to campaigns
until Labor Day. This year they worked hard to avert their eyes through
the whole show. Thus the paradox: The longer the campaign, the less the
public pays attention. To be charitable, it wasn't so much a lack of interest
as the gagging lack of oxygen one encounters in the air of unreality around
a campaign. You can take the atmospheric depression for a couple months,
but then you start to pass out. <BR>
<BR>
Nor is the national mental health the only loss. A President was distracted
from his duties for over one fourth of his first term. Not that he minded,
of course. But those days of fundraising and leading rallies were days when
he did not attend to normal business. The same goes for the voters. The
months spent learning--falsely--that Medicare was threatened were months
when long term solutions to the looming entitlement crisis were not addressed
at all. Indeed, it could be said that by avoiding the real issues facing
the country, or exploiting them for demagogic ends, the national campaign
served to decrease the sum of popular knowledge. <BR>
<BR>
It doesn't have to be this way. In September, while our campaign ground
on, the Japanese called a national election, and six weeks later, held it.
All the action was concentrated, and therefore bearable. <BR>
<BR>
We have come to the stage of our history where elections no longer provide
political catharsis. Nor do they produce anger or division, necessarily.
They produce exhaustion. <BR>
<BR>
Of course there are no panaceas in public life, but there are some things
that could help prevent a repeat of the Long Campaign of 1996. First, the
President and Congress could agree to prohibit any dispersal of federal
campaign matching funds to abet funds raised by presidential candidates,
unless they were raised after December, 1999. That would tend to dry up
about four to six months of early campaigning, or at least to slow it. <BR>
<BR>
The second contribution to sanity would be to change the election date from
November to October and move the inauguration forward from late January
to early December. In the Information Age we don&iacute;t need several months
to communicate with voters. &quot;The first Tuesday after the first Monday
in November&quot; is a date set in law in 1872; it&iacute;s not the Constitution,
and there is nothing sacred about it. The inauguration date also can be
changed. The third week in January is typically the worst week of winter
in Washington, D.C., while early December is usually cold, but endurable,
and sometimes quite pleasant. <BR>
<BR>
Knocking out a month of campaigning at the end would concentrate people&iacute;s
interest while weakening the present demand for money for television ads.
There&iacute;s only so much air time for sale, and after a campaign starts
buying it during the midnight wrestling matches, you know they are over-spending.
If the First Amendment cannot limit spending, let the calendar do it. <BR>
<BR>
Another reform would be to persuade the political parties to pass a rule
refusing to seat delegates to the national nominating conventions who were
selected in primaries held before mid-March. This apparently is the only
way to force states to repeal the front-loaded schedule and thereby to shorten
the campaign. Unfortunately, this reform needed approval at this year&iacute;s
conventions in order to apply in 2000. <BR>
<BR>
Besides, all of this was known by the parties over a year ago and ignored.
Now that the campaign is over, the lesson also will be ignored by the public
until it is taught once more in 2000. Then it will be too late, again, to
change before 2004. There does not seem to be enough sustained public annoyance
to force Washington, D.C. to fix the problem. <BR>
<BR>
Fellow voters, am I wrong about that?</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><CENTER>F<B>or more than a century, science attempted to explain all
human behaviour as the subrational product of unbending chemical, genetic,
or environmental forces. The spiritual side of human nature was ignored,
if not denied outright. <BR>
<BR>
This rigid scientific materialism infected all other areas of human knowledge,
laying the foundations for much of modern psychology, sociology, economics,
and political science. Yet today new developments in biology, physics, and
artificial intelligence are raising serious doubts about scientific materialism
and re-opening the case for the supernatural. <BR>
<BR>
What do these exciting developments mean for the social sciences that were
built upon the foundation of materialism? This project brings together leading
scholars from the natural sciences and those from the humanities and social
sciences in order to explore what the demise of materialism means for reviving
the various disciplines</B></CENTER>

Budget and tax issues could land Kemp vice-presidential slot	<BR>

<P>The great economic debate of 1996 is already roiled by divergent interpretations
of budget plans, but now Jack Kemp and the National Commission on Economic
Growth and Tax Policy, which just reported, are attempting to direct top
attention to the still more volatile subject of tax reform.<BR>
<BR>
The report arrives in a capital stalemated on economic policy. In 1992 the
voters chose one concept of &quot;change&quot; for the White House and in
1994 voted for something nearly opposite for Congress.<BR>
<BR>
The result is a kind of battle-in-place that seems likely 1) to silence
those who keep saying that &quot;there's not a dime's worth of difference
between the two parties; 2) to give Wall street a perpetual case of nerves,
because now the only real budget reflections will come in nonentitlement
spending that Congress can control through &quot;continuing resolutions&quot;
and, 3) to put off real budget and tax reform until at least the November
election.<BR>
<BR>
Given the Machiavellian nature of politics and the avoidance syndrome  
 voters sometimes exhibit when confronted with complex trade-off, there
is a fair chance that even this opportunity to debate the future of the
economy   could be lost. The election may be dominated by scandals (real
and fake), showmanship in the autumn TV debates or the kind of distracting
&quot;October Surprise&quot; in foreign affairs that incumbents sometime
spring on challengers. But the stakes in the economic debate are so great
for every voter that the country might just keep its attention focused long
enough to sort out the contending claims and choices.<BR>
<BR>
Republican presidential candidates already are talking tax reform and finding
at least the conservative electorate extraordinarily attentive. Publisher
and candidate Steve Forbes deserves special credit for undeviating emphasis
on the theme of economic opportunity. It is one thing for Rep. Dick Armey
of Texas and Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama to propose a flat tax, and another
for a well-financed presidential aspirant like Forbes to force every other
contender to focus on it. The same may soon be said of Forbes' proposal
for using the private sector to rescue the Social Security system for the
elderly and to allow ordinary young Americans to build up a truly generous
retirement income - an idea that borrows from Chile's recent experience
and echoes a proposal by <A HREF="/Timbuktu/beard.html">Sam Beard </A>(founder
of the P.I.'s Jefferson Awards and a Discovery Institute Fellow).<BR>
<BR>
Nearly all the GOP candidates have a tax reform plan of their own and each
can explain why his is better than Forbes' but the main thing is that they
all have to address the effectiveness and fairness of basic tax laws. That
hasn't happened before.<BR>
<BR>
Now Kemp, a mentor of Forbes, is also pushing tax reform onto the national
agenda. A popular former GOP legislative leader in the Reagan Revolution,
a presidential primary contender in 1988 and maverick Cabinet secretary
under George Bush - Kemp does not have any obvious ax to grind in presenting
the economic report requested by House Speaker Gingrich and Senate Leader
Dole. Indeed, his advocacy of the upbeat message of tax relief and economic
expansion assumes greater authority in the media and the public precisely
because he stands a bit above the fray.<BR>
<BR>
Kemp has long had three big policy passions. Saving American's families
is one. Sharing the promise of opportunity with people of all races and
classes is another. But leading them all is his commitment to economic growth.
He saw in the 80s how Reagan defense increases (however necessary) and spending
by the Democratic Congress overwhelmed the budgetary effects of the Reagan
tax cuts. The economy as a whole flourished, but as Secretary of State George
Shultz quipped, &quot;The country's doing great, but the government's broke.&quot;
The reputation of the Reagan tax cut stimulus remains to this day submerge
in undeserved controversy.<BR>
<BR>
Kemp burns with desire to get the policy mix - budget controls, family tax
credits and lower marginal rates of taxation - right next time. That will
take greater consensus on the right than now exists. As a result, Kemp's
commission avoids nailing down many important details, but does try to define
the principles - biased strongly toward economic growth - that should govern
the debate. And it makes the debate itself imperative, regardless of the
outcome of the primaries.<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, by not running for President and yet making himself so useful
to Bob Dole, the presidential front-runner, and Newt Gingrich, the right's
chief visionary and political hammer, Kemp personally is back on the national
stage. In a few months he could find himself on the GOP ticket for Vice
President.<BR>
<BR>
It is a thought that could trouble and amaze his old friend Steve Forbes.
Regardless, they both will be among the leading instructors in the great
national economic teach-in this year.<BR>

Sam Beard, founder of the National Development Council and Fellow of Discovery
Institute, is an accomplished leader in economic development. Here now is
his carefully conceived and meticulously studied plan to save Social Security.
What makes his plan stunningly distinct is its potential to create real
economic opportunity for the three-quarters of Americans whose financial
situations prevent them from saving for their retirement.<BR>
<BR>
In university classrooms, senior centers, chambers of commerce and on talk
radio, Beard's proposal is being well-received by retirees, Babyboomers
and Generation X. Beards has undertaken this as his mission, and is disproving
the conventional expectation of generational divisions over any proposal
to change social security. Indeed, he is finding remarkable acceptance and
approval of his ideas in every venue.<BR>

<BR>
The message of this book cuts to the heart of a new revolution sweeping
across America.</B> The message addresses a concern you probably feel in
your gut as intensely as I do-a helplessness and insecurity about our nation's
future. It's a sentiment many of us are trying to communicate to our friends,
family members and politicians. Americans are worried about their country's
direction, and their political opinions are volatile. <BR>
<BR>
<B>For proof, we need only examine the results of recent national elections.</B>
We simply don't like the way things are going. We are looking for new answers,
and we are prepared to sweep out old ways for those that work. We desperately
want to believe that our actions make a difference. We want to know that
we still control our own destiny. When we believe we have job security,
the ability to get ahead, and that the safety and educational opportunities
of our children are assured, Americans feel their country is on the right
track. But these issues are among our most serious concerns today. We are
fed up, with the direction in which our government is leading us. We are
angry and very distrustful of our politicians. Americans in both parties-liberals
and conservatives-have the same concern: We are paying too much in taxes,
getting too little in return, and recklessly mortgaging our future. People
simply don't trust government solutions or our political leaders. Thus,
a new revolution is underway-redefining the role of government as it affects
people's lives and pocketbooks.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H2><CENTER>Millions of Americans Are Angry and Frustrated</CENTER>
</H2>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Many of us are afraid that future opportunity is diminishing.</B>
When I interviewed people for this book, I asked, &quot;Will your children
have a higher standard of living and greater opportunities than you?&quot;
Eight out of ten immediately responded no- indicating they strongly believed
their children would have a lowerstandard of living and less opportunity.
This runs contrary to traditional American optimism. We pride ourselves
in working hard, and passing expanded opportunities on to our children.
America historically sees itself as a land of progress and dreams. But,
a majority of Americans today feel we are on a treadmill. We are angry.
And we are ready for change.</BLOCKQUOTE>

campaign.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<I>William Kristol, The Weekly Standard</I><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;...if we do not plan for the future, entitlement spending promises
will exceed financial resources in the next century. The current spending
trend is clearly unsustainable. In this creative book, Sam Beard lucidly
identifies some <BR>
of the problems in our Social Security system and proposes <BR>
innovative ways to solve them.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<I>United States Senator (D) Bob Kerry </I><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Sam Beard's call for a national grassroots debate on these issues
is so vitally important for the future of the Social Security program. Beard
offers Americans a fresh, outside-the-beltway approach which deserves our
most serious and conscientious consideration.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<I>United States Senator (R) Alan K. Simpson</I><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Sam Beard has devised the unassailable substitute for the Social Security
system, which even the AARP would approve of. Why didn't we think of it?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<I>William F. Buckley, Jr.</I><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Sam Beard offers a creative plan to remodel Social Security for the
21st century while upholding that contract with today's seniors. ... His
plan not only protects seniors and ensures retirement security for future
generations, but promises economic growth and keeps the American Dream alive.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<I>Sandra L. Butler, President United Senior Association</I><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;As Social Security hurdles towards insolvency, Sam Beard offers an
innovative approach that might enable America to stave off entitlement collapse
and provide future generations with a vibrant retirement system. His recommendations
deserve serious analysis and consideration.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<I>Richard Thau, Jonathon Karl, Douglas Kennedy, Third Millennium</I><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Restoring Hope in America brings the looming Social Security crisis
to our attention - and presents a unique and thoughtful solution worth discussing!
... Everyone should read Restoring Hope in America and get involved in the
debate about Social Security.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<I>Dorcas Hardy, Former U.S. Commissioner of Social Security</I></CENTER>

<title> Organized Crime, Organized Labor, And Corruption Of The Federal Grants Process -- Heritage</title>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;


	
An agreement between the U.S. Department of Justice and an allegedly crime-ridden labor union is being scrutinized in Congress because of allegations that political considerations may have led the government to adopt a lenient stance toward the union. One aspect of the relations between the Clinton Administration and the Laborers' International Union of North America which merits particular examination is the string of federal grants that have continued to subsidize LIUNA even as government investigators were uncovering evidence of organized criminal influence in the union. Restriction or elimination of grants to politically active groups like unions ought to be high on the list of remedies Congress considers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	In addition to examining the Clinton Administration's handling of criminal investigations, Congress should seek to ascertain why purely discretionary funds continued to flow to a group subject to such serious allegations. Were federal grantmakers aware of long-pending allegations that LIUNA was tied to organized crime? And in reviewing evidence that union leaders misused union funds, Congress should ask the General Accounting Office and other agencies to investigate how those same officials used taxpayer funds entrusted to them.
<p>
<b>Welfare for Unions</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	The vast patronage network created by Congress and the federal bureaucracy during the past 40 years is out of control. Each year, American taxpayers fund nearly $39 billion in grants to over 40,000 private organizations,<sup>1</sup> many of which taxpayers might find objectionable or offensive. Even when the advertised purpose of a federal grant seems inoffensive, every federal dollar that an organization receives frees private resources for other uses, including political and lobbying activities in pursuit of ever more government subsidies. Furthermore, most federal grants include an "overhead" allowance that directly subsidizes all of a recipient's activities.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Over the past few decades, labor unions have been among the major beneficiaries of federal largesse, receiving literally billions of dollars for educational, training, and construction programs.<sup>2</sup> The maze of federal grants to unions in areas ranging from job-training to AIDS education is so vast, and public disclosure so limited, that a precise figure is unavailable. One admittedly preliminary investigation uncovered $110 million in "direct subsidies" to unions between January 1993 to March 1994 from the Departments of Labor, Justice, Housing and Urban Development, and Health and Human Services alone.<sup>3</sup> And this is dwarfed by the indirect subsidies unions receive through worker training grants distributed by the states under the $3.4 billion federal Job Training Partnership Act.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	This year, the AFL-CIO has earmarked $35 million to defeat conservative members of the 104th Congress. Yet federal grants to the AFL-CIO continue. In the midst of this campaign, for example, the AFL-CIO was awarded a "financial management training" grant of $400,000 by President Clinton's supposedly nonpartisan "national service" program, AmeriCorps.<sup>4</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	While any group should be free to pursue legitimate political aims, labor unions enjoy two unusual privileges: federal grant subsidies and the ability to force workers to subsidize political efforts with which many union members disagree. Both of these privileges allow organized labor to use dollars earned coercively-either from taxpayers through federal grants or from union members through mandatory dues payments-to support a narrow ideological agenda.
<p>


<b>Money, Crime, and Politics</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	In addition to the question of whether politically active groups should receive federal funding, the lack of accountability in the federal grants process is disturbing. The Laborers' International Union of North America received more than $11 million in federal grant money in FY 1994. In the 1994 election cycle, LIUNA's political action committee, the Laborers' Political League, donated over $1 million to Democratic Party congressional candidates. Whether federal grant dollars effectively subsidized political activity is a legitimate subject of inquiry, but the grants to LIUNA raise an even more significant question: Why did LIUNA continue to receive millions in federal grant dollars when it had been singled out for a decade as probably infiltrated by organized crime?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	In 1986, President Reagan's Commission on Organized Crime issued a landmark report detailing the influence of organized crime on labor unions. The report singled out several unions, suggesting in a chapter entitled "A Case Waiting to be Made" that the Justice Department file racketeering charges against the Laborers' International Union of North America to return control of the union to its members.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Eight years later, in November 1994, DOJ's organized crime and racketeering section delivered a 212-page draft complaint to LIUNA's general president, Arthur Coia. The charge: that Coia, along with several co-conspirators, had "employed actual and threatened force, violence and economic injury to create a climate of intimidation and fear" at the Rhode Island-based union, which represents 700,000 workers, primarily in the hazardous waste cleanup and construction trades. The complaint recommended that Coia be "immediately removed" from his post as general president and that control of the union be assumed by an independent administrator.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Over the past two decades, LIUNA officials have recorded over 80 convictions for crimes ranging from racketeering to bribery, extortion, tax evasion, and attempted murder. Despite this record and the lengthy Justice Department report detailing Coia's use of "fear and intimidation" in running the union, Coia was not removed as head of LIUNA. In February 1995, the Justice Department reached an agreement with the union by which Coia kept his job in exchange for a promise that he would weed out corruption.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	DOJ's voluntary agreement with LIUNA, proposed by the union in response to the 212-page draft complaint, was the first of its kind in a racketeering case involving a labor union. It relies on LIUNA itself-not a court-appointed officer granted wide powers and broad access to federal investigative resources-to institute needed reforms.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	In the consent decree filed by LIUNA and DOJ, the union acknowledged that "the organized crime syndicate known as La Cosa Nostra has at various times had a corrupting influence on the affairs of various locals and other entities within LIUNA." The union also openly admitted that it "ha[d] not eliminated all of such corrupting influence" in its ranks.<sup>5</sup> In effect, the "Department of Justice farm[ed] out the task of mob-busting to a union boss they once charged as a racketeer."<sup>6</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	The House Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Crime recently held hearings in conjunction with the tenth anniversary of the Reagan Commission to examine how LIUNA remained under Coia's thumb. One theory is that politics may have played a role.<sup>7</sup> Coia lent $100,000 of LIUNA money to the Clinton Inaugural Committee; and in 1993 and 1994, the Laborers' Political League donated over $1 million to Democratic Party congressional candidates. During 1995 and the first quarter of 1996, the LPL has contributed $747,000 to over 200 liberal congressional candidates. Coia personally served as vice chairman of a May 1996 fund-raiser that raised $12 million for the Democratic Party.
<p>
<b>LIUNA and Federal Grants</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	In addition to reviewing the Justice Department's decision to allow Coia to remain as LIUNA's general president, the Judiciary Committee might wish to investigate federal funding of the union's training programs. Since 1986, millions of tax dollars have flowed to this union, described by the Commission on Organized Crime as a "corrupt" organization whose "leaders steal or misuse workers' funds." Moreover, the November 1994 Justice Department complaint noted that "in or about 1986 to on or about July 31, 1994," LIUNA leaders intended to devise a scheme to "defraud training and education funds of various upstate locals" in New York by using "actual and threatened force" to "induce the locals to surrender control of these funds."<sup>8</sup> In FY 1994, while the Justice Department was investigating graft and intimidation at LIUNA, the union and its affiliates received 38 grants totaling $11,376,000 from four federal agencies and departments: the Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Health and Human Services, Department of Housing and Urban Development, and Department of Labor.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	In April 1995, less than three months after the Justice Department signed its agreement with LIUNA, the Department of Housing and Urban Development signed its own agreement with the union. HUD awarded the Laborers' Institute for Training and Education, a LIUNA affiliate, a $3.5 million grant to "provide construction and environmental training and career opportunities and advancement for public housing residents."<sup>10</sup> Under this grant, according to LIUNA, public housing residents will be trained in "basic construction and environmental remediation skills," after which they will "become members of LIUNA" and "enjoy long-term access to future employment opportunities through union hiring halls." It is little wonder that, upon receiving this grant, Coia declared that "this is just one more shining example of how the Clinton administration and the LIUNA is [sic] putting people first."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Congress should call additional hearings to require the relevant grantmaking officials at HUD to testify about their decision to award such a major grant to LIUNA just three months after the consent decree was signed. In particular, HUD's Assistant Secretary for Public and Indian Housing, Joseph Shuldiner, who signed the April 26, 1995, grant, should be asked about his knowledge of wrongdoing at LIUNA as well as what efforts his bureau is taking to prevent such wrongdoing in the future.
<p>
<b>Lessons for the Federal Grants Process</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;


	LIUNA is just one of the nearly 40,000 private organizations that receive more than $39 billion annually in federal grant funds. Like LIUNA, many of these groups also take an active part in the political process by promoting a particular ideological agenda or by lobbying for increased federal spending. When the taxpayers fund special interests, they make it possible for these organizations to use private resources for such purposes. The federal grants process employs the coercive power of government to force taxpayers to finance organizations whose political agenda they oppose. With regard to LIUNA specifically, tax dollars have gone repeatedly to an organization whose leadership has played a significant role in supporting the Democratic Party.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Wholly aside from LIUNA's links to the Clinton Administration, organizations alleged to be rife with criminal wrongdoing should be ineligible for federal funding. Clearly, federal grant dollars should not be given to any organization with admitted ties to organized crime for the purpose of recruiting more members. Whatever other else might be done to prevent the abuse of federal grants for political purposes, this is a first step upon which liberals and conservatives alike should be able to agree.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As Congress reviews charges that LIUNA officials misused union funds, government investigators should be asked whether they reviewed the receipt and use of taxpayer funds by those same officials. Given the union's admission of wrongdoing, an investigation and accounting of the use of recent federal grants clearly is in order. Because of questions about the relationship between the Clinton Administration and LIUNA, the General Accounting Office, an independent congressional agency, should conduct that review.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The LIUNA case is an example of the inherent conflict of interest in permitting executive branch agencies to give grants to politically active groups. In 1995, Congress attempted to address the problem of taxpayer-subsidized political activities by ending grants to groups that engage in lobbying. Unfortunately, the restriction Congress approved applies only to one category of lobbying organization, and efforts to erect broader restrictions on federally funded lobbying, principally the Istook-McIntosh-Ehrlich Amendment, were stymied by congressional liberals. Along with general efforts to eliminate welfare for lobbyists, Congress should identify and eliminate all programs that serve most often to channel funding to special-interest groups.<sup>11</sup> This case should serve to stimulate such efforts.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	As Congress questions the standard for criminal prosecution in cases such as LIUNA's, it also should consider an intermediate step: barring federal grants to suspect organizations. During the ten years that allegations against LIUNA have been pending, government grantmakers appear to have been uninformed of or unconcerned about substantial evidence of criminal activity within the union. Because federal grants to organizations like LIUNA are discretionary, it would be entirely reasonable to withhold money from suspect groups and award it to others. Government should take all reasonable steps to protect taxpayer funds even before seeking criminal sanctions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Congress should consider steps to stop-or at least require a review of-federal grants to any group for which there is substantial evidence of corruption. Among the actions which might trigger such a review:
<ul>
 <p><li>Conviction of a group's officers or employees on charges indicating abuse of monies or organizational powers;
 
 <p><li>Delivery or filing of charges against an organization by federal, state, or local law enforcement agencies; or
 
<p><li>Any public disclosure of criminal activity by an organization.
</ul><p>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Having raised serious legal concerns about the propriety of the Clinton Administration's decision to allow the crime-infested Laborer's International Union to remain out of federal receivership, Congress also should ask why such an organization has continued to receive federal grant subsidies. LIUNA presents a case study of serious problems in the federal grants process. Since 1993, the Laborers' Political League has donated nearly $1.75 million to Democratic Party congressional candidates. At the same time, LIUNA affiliates have received over $15 million in federal grants. Indeed, just three months after it admitted to organized crime infiltration in federal court, LIUNA received a $3.5 million grant from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;



	It is time for Congress to end the corruption of the federal grants process by acting immediately to:<ul>

 <p><li><b>Require</b> that relevant grantmakers at HUD, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Labor testify about their knowledge of allegations of criminal infiltration of LIUNA;
 
 <p><li><b>Prohibit</b> organizations whose officers have records of criminal wrongdoing from receiving federal grants;
 
 <p><li><b>Renew</b> efforts to restrict lobbying by federal grantees; and
 
<p><li><b>Order</b> a General Accounting Office investigation into LIUNA's handling of federal grants.</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	It is bad enough that mandatory dues from union members are used to pay for corruption and political activities. Taxpayers should not be forced to pay as well.

<font size=4>

We are pleased that you find our publications to be valuable 
resources and that you are interested in sharing them with
others who are concerned about the well-being of the traditional
family.

<p>

You may reprint any FRC publication, subject to the following 
conditions:

<p><ul>

<li>The item excerpted must be taken in full and without alteration,
unless it can be condensed without altering its meaning and such
condensation is noted.
<p>
<li>Full attribution must be made to the Family Research Council (and
<I>Washington Watch</I>, <i>Ed Facts</i>, or whatever source you used)
and the attribution should include the date of the item and the
author, if noted in the publication.
<p>
<li>Please include the location of our Internet site:  http://www.frc.org
<p>
<li>The Family Research Council provides its publications to citizens
upon request.  There is no &quot;subscription&quot; cost, but
freewill donations to support the publications are accepted. 
Space permitting, we ask that reprints of items from our materials
be accompanied by this information about the availability of our
publications.  This information should include the address of
the Family Research Council (700 Thirteenth Street, NW, Washington,

you or your organization to contact the Council each time a similar 
reprint is contemplated.

<p>

<title>Questioning the Bosnia Peace Plan -- Heritage</title>

<center><h3><i>QUESTIONING THE BOSNIA PEACE PLAN</i></h3>
By John Hillen<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder No. 1062<br>
November 30, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
The recent conclusion of a <a href="http://www.state.gov/www/current/bosnia/bosagree.html">Bosnian peace accord</a> is a welcome development in a brutal conflict that has raged unchecked for four years. However, there are very serious questions that need to be answered about the political viability of the accord and the effectiveness of the American military intervention to implement it.
<p>
In his nationally televised address on November 27, President Clinton stated that he will request congressional support for the deployment of over 20,000 <a href=" http://www.dtic.dla.mil/bosnia/">American ground troops</a> to Bosnia. The President will also have to convince a very skeptical U.S. public that the sacrifice of American lives and resources is worth the short-term results he hopes to achieve. Most important, the President will have to convince both Congress and the American people that he has not committed American troops to an open-ended and ill-defined military mission in the midst of a volatile civil war.
<P>
To assess fully the tough political and military issues involved, Congress should be prepared to ask the President specific questions about the practicalities of the Bosnian peace plan and about the risks and costs associated with an American military intervention that would implement such a plan.
<p>

<b>QUESTIONS ABOUT POLITICAL VIABILITY</b>
<p>

<b>Q. Is a bifurcated Bosnian state a realistic and sustainable political entity? </b>
<p>
The <a href="http://dosfan.lib.uic.edu/bosagree.html">Bosnian peace accord</a> proposes a Bosnia-Herzegovina that has the appearance of a single state, but is in fact based on two separate political entities -- the Bosnian Muslim/Croat Federation and the Bosnian Serb Republic. For the central organs of Bosnia to function as intended, the two separate entities will have to show the most extraordinary goodwill and cooperation toward each other, qualities that have never been in evidence in Bosnia. 
<p>
Many experienced diplomats have expressed skepticism about the political viability of this Bosnian state and the realistic chances of its survival as a centrally governed and coherent nation. Former National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski has stated that the accord is a contrived peace that actually creates "two and a half states."<sup>1</sup><p>Much of this skepticism is rooted in the fact that the accord does not address fundamental issues of sovereignty and ethnic self-determination. Instead, it freezes those unresolved issues in place and offers up an elaborate power-sharing agreement for a Bosnian central government. However, it will be difficult for a contrived central government to replace the bonds of loyalty, authority, and legitimacy that currently exist between Bosnian Croats and Croatia and Bosnian Serbs and Serbia. These bonds are rooted in centuries of political, ethnic, and cultural identity and are sure to prove stronger than bonds to a hastily fabricated central government. 
<p>
This central dilemma was noted recently by Swedish diplomat Thomas Gur, who wrote that this "peace plan has many built-in contradictions and weaknesses. Many of the proposed arrangements lay the groundwork for possible new conflicts between different minorities, and for future interventions by Serbia as well as Croatia. If the arrangements for peace in Bosnia are carried out according to the peace plan, new conflicts will be triggered by old ones."<sup>2</sup><p>If history is any guide, this agreement stands little chance of lasting. In Cyprus in 1964, international negotiators reached a similar agreement between Turkish and Greek Cypriots. Much like the Bosnian agreement, the doomed Cyprus accord attempted to replace bonds to the "parent entities" for both sides (Greece and Turkey) with an unworkable central executive and ethnically aligned parliamentary blocs. This ensured continued intractability. This structure never worked because it never addressed the fundamental fears and aspirations of the warring factions and was predicated on a diplomatic fantasy:  hopes for a degree of cooperation that had never been present in Cyprus. After 10 years of sporadic fighting and instability under this makeshift arrangement, Turkey invaded the island in 1974, partitioned Cyprus, and put an end to the ephemeral peace -- an imposed peace that was never locally supported. United Nations peacekeepers have been in Cyprus for over 30 years. 
<p>
The same pattern can be expected in Bosnia. How can an imposed peace that does not reflect political realities or the basic concerns of the warring factions hope to survive except by the continued enforcement of thousands of NATO and American troops?  The recently concluded Bosnian peace accord is inherently weak because it fails to address the fundamental issues that caused the parties to go to war in the first place. It is, at best, a cease-fire that can work only under the continued stewardship of 60,000 heavily armed NATO combat troops.<sup>3 </sup><p><b>Q. Is the Bosnian Muslim/Croat Federation itself a politically sustainable arrangement? </b>
<p>
The entire peace accord is predicated on the notion that the Muslim/Croat Federation is a solid political entity that can be endowed with more political and military resources and that will continue to grow in cohesiveness as an uneasy counterweight to the Bosnian Serb Republic. There is considerable doubt about the solidarity of this alliance, which came about as a marriage of convenience in 1994.
<p>
Before that federation was formed, the Croats and Muslims fought a brutal war for control of cities such as Mostar in Bosnia. Contentious territorial and refugee issues remain to be settled between the two groups. Many observers believe that the Muslim/Croat Federation started to come apart as soon as there was no imminent Serbian threat to hold it together. A U.N. official in Zagreb recently noted that "the American plan rests on the assumption that the Muslim-Croat federation is solid. Maybe that plan is built on sand."<sup>4</sup><p><b>Q. Is this peace accord locally supported? </b>
<P>
While Slobodan Milosevic purports to speak for the Bosnian Serb leaders, local support is far from guaranteed. Since 1992, the Bosnian Serbs have reneged twice on deals backed by President Milosevic. If anything, initial signs have been distressing. All three Bosnian Serbs present at the Dayton peace talks refused to sign the peace accord, and Bosnian Serb leaders denounced the accord within hours of its initialing. Since then Bosnian Serbs in Sarajevo have staged protests and their leader, Radovan Karadzic, has insisted that the Sarajevo provisions of the peace accord doom that city to the fate of Beirut and must be renegotiated. The leader of the Bosnian Serb Parliament stated that "the agreement that has been reached does not meet even the minimum of our interests."<sup>5</sup>  In addition to these and other signs of a possible split between Milosevic and Bosnian Serb leaders, there are many different factions within the Muslim and Croat camps, all with local ambitions and aspirations. It must be remembered that there is very little central control over many paramilitary elements ostensibly connected with one of the three sides. These include, among others, the 1,000 Mujahideen militia fighters from Iran, Afghanistan, and elsewhere who recently have attacked British forces in Bosnia and are suspected of murdering an American working for the U.N. near Tuzla.<sup>6</sup><p><b>Q. What issues remain unresolved, and how does the Bosnian peace accord address those problems? </b>
<p>
It is not a good sign that some of the thorniest issues raised at <a href="http://dosfan.lib.uic.edu/bosagree.html">Dayton</a> were left unresolved. In particular, the dispute over the Serbian corridor around Brcko was left to be submitted to binding arbitration by a panel made up of Muslims, Serbs, and Europeans. The content, character, method, and authority of the arbitration were not specified. Also not addressed were specifics about how to integrate the two (or possibly three) rival armies into one that would serve the foreign policies of the central government, and specific measures to ensure that indicted war criminals would be brought to trial.
<p>
<b>Q. What long-term commitment has the U.S. made to the continued security of  Bosnia-Herzegovina in its planned form? </b>
<p>
Even if the bulk of U.S. ground troops leave within 12 to 18 months, the United States will incur some form of continuing security obligation to Bosnia. President Clinton not only must define clearly the exact nature of that commitment, but also must identify the strategic resources he intends to allocate to that commitment and the contingency plans he will ask the military to prepare. The commitment of the United States to the continued existence of this state of Bosnia-Herzegovina will certainly go beyond the initial use of American troops on the ground in Bosnia. This was very much the case, for example, after the liberation of Kuwait during Operation Desert Storm. Since 1991, the United States has been heavily engaged in defending Kuwait, undertaking operations such as "Vigilant Warrior" in October 1994, which sent thousands of American soldiers to Kuwait on almost no notice. In addition, President Clinton just announced an extension of the U.S. military presence in Haiti. A similar commitment to Bosnia needs to be factored into the strategic, operational, logistical, resources, and fiscal planning of the military.
<p>

<b>QUESTIONS ABOUT THE IMPLEMENTATION FORCE</b>
<p>
There also are serious questions about the military feasibility of <a href="gopher://marvin.stc.nato.int:70/11/yugo">NATO's</a> Implementation Force (IFOR).
<p>
<b>Q. What are the defined and measurable military objectives for this peace implementation mission? </b>
<p>
The military mission in Bosnia will be so-called peace implementation. This is a term invented by the Clinton Administration to describe a dangerous and ambiguous mission that will be improvised on the ground and made up as it goes along. In 1994, after an intensive study of the dynamics of post-Cold War peacekeeping and peace enforcement operations, the <a href="http://www.army.mil">U.S. Army</a> released a comprehensive doctrinal manual entitled <i>Peace Operations</i>. This manual describes how the U.S. military will operate in various peace support missions, including support for diplomacy, peacemaking, peace building, preventive diplomacy, peacekeeping, and peace enforcement. "Peace implementation" is not addressed.
<p>
When the U.S. military is given a task, it must be one which it understands and one for which it has trained. Clearly defined, decisive, and attainable military objectives must be identified, and these objectives must contribute directly to the political goals of the operation. There are significant doubts about the existence of such objectives in the Bosnia peace implementation force. The United States must be able to measure the success of operations and formulate an exit strategy that leaves something sustainable behind. It brings to mind the confusion felt by Marines in Lebanon when they were asked to go ashore in 1982 and "establish a presence."  That is not a defined military mission. It is merely a deployment of troops without a realizable mission.
<p>
<b>Q. Why will American forces work under self-imposed restraints? </b>
<p>
Peacekeeping, peace enforcement, or even peace implementation are missions that depend ultimately on the goodwill of the warring factions in order to succeed. There is no question of trying to coerce all factions into a pattern of behavior with only 60,000 NATO troops (of whom fewer than 20,000 will be "trigger pullers"). The bottom line for the American armed forces is that they will be in a mission that places U.S. troops in a strategically passive posture. 
<p>
After the Vietnam war and the 1983 disaster in Lebanon, American political and military officials formulated a comprehensive doctrine ensuring that when U.S. troops are deployed into imminent hostilities, it is with a coherent strategy and every conceivable operational advantage. One condition guaranteed to the military is that they will receive a mission that allows American forces the operational freedom and resources to keep the initiative of action -- to dictate the terms of battle to their advantage. This allows American military forces to create the conditions they need to succeed. It is a formula that worked brilliantly in Grenada, Panama, Desert Storm, and even in peace operations like the initial U.S.-led humanitarian relief effort by President Bush in Somalia. 
<P>
The Bosnia peace implementation plan does the opposite. It strips any advantage from American ground forces and places U.S. troops in a passive and reactive posture. It gives the initiative of action to the warring factions and ensures that, regardless of U.S. action, the warring factions will be the sole determinants of mission success.
<p>
Secretary of Defense William Perry has tried to pre-empt the inevitable criticism of this static and passive military role for American forces by insisting that the U.S. will be "the meanest dog in town."  This gives the U.S. the opportunity to respond to tactical attacks, but still within a strategically passive mission. It raises again the specter of strategic incoherence that was so prevalent in U.S. strategy during the Vietnam war. While the U.S. may "win" all the little fights on the ground in Bosnia, the entire effort may have nothing to show for its "victories" at the end of the mission. 
<p>
Being the "meanest dog in town" is no advantage in Bosnian terrain that negates the U.S. superiority in armor and maneuver. It is no advantage against a foe who, in the words of strategist Andrew Krepinevich, will be more likely to attack U.S. forces as "fleas, and not another dog."<sup>7</sup>  It is no advantage when the U.S. is kept chained by a passive and static strategy that deprives the U.S. of the operational advantages of effective military doctrine. This mission will give the U.S. forces all the political constraints and liabilities of traditional peacekeeping, but with all the dangers and expenses of an enforcement operation -- and with no control over the results. Peace implementation combines the worst of both worlds, with no guarantee that the benefits of American intervention will outweigh the costs.
<p>
<b>Q. How will American forces know when they have accomplished their mission and are ready to leave? </b>
<p>
In order for the U.S. to avoid "mission creep" -- the unintended and unanticipated acceptance of new missions and new mandates -- it must stick to a comprehensive and clearly articulated strategy that lays out military objectives and a clear exit strategy. President Clinton stated in his national address that the mission in Bosnia would be clear, limited, and achievable. For that to be true, clearly defined and easily measurable military criteria must be identified at all levels of the military effort:  strategic, operational, and tactical. The prospects and costs of achieving these criteria also must be clearly stated. 
<p>
The <a href="http://www.dtic.dla.mil/bosnia/">American and NATO forces</a> deployed to Bosnia have very broad powers that extend to disarmament, refugee resettlement, election security, and even nation-building. A workable military campaign plan must reconcile those sweeping and comprehensive powers with the President's wish to keep the mission clear, limited, and achievable; it is inconsistent to state that the mission will be limited and at the same time plan for the forces to accomplish something politically sustainable. President Clinton has maintained all along that this deployment will be limited in scope, but the peace accord opens the door for NATO peacekeepers to perform many nation-building activities such as ensuring the free movement and resettlement of refugees, aiding humanitarian workers, resolving boundary disputes, creating secure conditions for free elections, and responding to violence against civilians.
<p>
Having multiple missions requires the military to have different criteria for success in these many tasks. In addition, the criteria for success at lower levels must add up to success at higher levels. The U.S. should not repeat the mistakes of the Vietnam war, in which criteria for success such as body counts and ammunition expenditure were ultimately irrelevant to the strategic and political outcome. Criteria should be easily measurable and must lead ultimately to an exit strategy. The exit strategy for a successful Bosnian peace implementation force must be driven by events, not by time as the President has suggested. It also cannot just reflect a "checklist" of tasks for American forces to accomplish. The exit strategy must be constructed with the intention of leaving behind a locally supported peace that does not require an open-ended commitment of American troops. In addition, in the very likely event that something does not go according to plan, several different exit strategies must be included in contingency plans. All possible eventualities must be planned for in military  operations.
<p>
<b>Q. How do American forces intend to avoid "mission creep?" </b>
<p>
Even with clearly defined, limited, achievable, and measurable objectives, U.S. forces can be subject to mission creep and escalatory fighting. The broad authority granted to NATO troops is a well-intentioned attempt by military planners to give the passively postured U.S. troops some measure of control over their environment and to help them minimize their risks and casualties. However, it also plants the seeds for mission creep and open-ended commitments. Ironically, the dynamics of mission creep and escalation will be most likely to take root when U.S. soldiers do the smart thing in response to aggression.
<p>
For instance, responding to attacks with "robust" rules of engagement will necessarily mean offensive combat operations. Vice President Al Gore noted recently that "if challenged, [American troops] will respond with brutal and overwhelming force... not just to provocations, but to evident intent."<sup>8</sup>  This aggressive attitude is in keeping with successful military doctrine, but it also presents a hazardous dilemma to American forces. If U.S. forces respond only to the immediate source of low-level attacks or threatened attacks (snipers, mortal teams, small paramilitary units), they run the risk of expending considerable resources in an attempt to swat a fly with a sledgehammer. If, however, as the Vice President implies, the U.S. commander chooses the far more effective option of responding to the primary source of the attack (local command headquarters, larger units, or leaders), then the action could easily deepen U.S. involvement. Robust rules of engagement are truly a double-edged sword in an intervention that is supposed to remain "limited."  By being tough and going after the "source" of the attack, the U.S. could escalate the conflict and lead to retaliations which require even harsher responses from the U.S. side.
<p>
The most poignant example of this occurred in Somalia. In June 1993, 24 Pakistani peacekeepers were killed by a mob of Somalis that included women and children. Instead of attempting to ferret out the responsible parties from within a surging street mob, the U.N. commander asked the U.S. to help him hit the source of the attack -- General Mohammed Farah Aideed. The U.S. then launched a series of limited offensive attacks to cut down Aideed's military power base and capture Aideed himself. This drew the U.S. deeper into the Somali conflict and gave American troops a new status as one more local faction in the Somali wars. All of this was brought on by robust rules of engagement. Although President Clinton talked tough in his November 27 speech, there are considerable risks and costs involved with "fighting fire with fire, and then some." As James Webb, former Secretary of the Navy and a highly decorated Vietnam combat veteran observed, the Bosnia rules of engagement are "a formula for confusion once a combat unit sent on a distinctly noncombat mission comes under repeated attack."<sup>9</sup><p>American troops will want to respond with disproportionate force in order to deter or discourage further attacks. However, the use of force always tends to draw all sides into further confrontation. Recent history provides unambiguous evidence of this. Attempts to undertake coercive disarmament or use robust rules of engagement in a peacekeeping-type operation failed in U.N. operations in the Congo in 1960-1964 and the former Yugoslavia and in U.S. missions in Lebanon (1982-1983) and Somalia (1992-1994). NATO's Implementation Force will be caught in a dilemma:  The more aggressively it operates, the better its chances of success and force protection, but also the more it will get drawn into the conflict and be seen as yet another warring faction.
<p>
<b>Q. Will the early withdrawal of American forces be supported by European allies, or will it cause the mission to collapse? </b>
<p>
Clinton has anticipated that American troops will be withdrawn within one year. In fact, the peace accord opens the possibility that the redeployment of American forces could begin as early as six months into the operation. European allies have universally condemned President Clinton's proposed timetable for American forces in Bosnia. President Chirac of France has predicted an armed NATO presence that could last up to 20 years. The United States intends to leave within 12 months because American public support would never tolerate a protracted and costly intervention in an area of marginal strategic interest to America. However, this action could damage U.S. credibility even further. 
<p>
In addition, local belligerents from all three factions who stand to gain by a continued American military presence are very likely to try to prevent U.S. withdrawal. In the past two years, U.N. units in Bosnia have been attacked by "friendly" factions opposed to their withdrawal or redeployment. The history of peacekeeping or peace enforcement does not offer many instances in which heavily involved forces have been able to make a quick and graceful exit. This brings to mind the Duke of Wellington's classic admonition that "Great nations do not fight small wars."  This reflects the fact that great powers cannot skip blithely in and out of conflicts. Once the prestige, honor, blood, and treasure of the United States are engaged, the U.S. will have to see the intervention through to its conclusion.
 <p>
<b>Q. What are the American contingency plans to deal with resistance to the efforts of the Implementation Force? </b><p>

Military commanders with experience in the Balkans have emphasized that U.S. forces are certain to encounter resistance from armed elements in Bosnia.<sup>10</sup>  President Clinton has stated that should the peace accord break down, U.S. troops would withdraw rather than stay in the midst of renewed civil war. A complete breakdown is not likely to happen because all parties benefit in the short run from the opportunity to rest and re-arm. It is far more likely that there will be sporadic and local levels of resistance and intransigence, in which case the United States will have only three bad options:  the "Northern Ireland option," in which the U.S. struggles on with the original mandate of the mission, accepting the casualties and continued commitment to the operation with no easily achievable end-state in sight; the "Vietnam option," in which the U.S. reinforces its forces and expands its mission and rules of engagement in order to try to force a solution through a more significant military effort; or the "Lebanon or Somalia option," in which the U.S. simply gives up and goes home. Any prolonged resistance could force the U.S. military in Bosnia into one of these options. There is no easy way out in Bosnia, especially in light of the resistance that can be anticipated. 
<p>
<b>Q. How does the U.S. plan to assume a peacekeeping role, train and arm the Bosnian Muslims, and supervise or enforce a "build-down" of Serbian armaments all at the same time? </b>
<p>
The implementation plan calls for the Bosnian Serbs to "reduce their military potential to the level where it is no longer a threat to the federation. If the Bosnian Serbs do not disarm, the United States has given assurances to the Bosnian government that it will level the playing field by equipping and training the Bosnian army."<sup>11</sup>  There are many questions still to be answered about the modalities of this mission and what role U.S. forces will play. The IFOR has broad powers under the agreement, including the power to remove or relocate certain units or weapons that it feels may threaten the mission. This will entail an active and most likely coercive role for IFOR. In addition, it remains to be seen how Bosnian Serb military potential will be measured, who will do the measuring, and exactly what types of coercive action will be taken against factions that refuse to disarm. 
<p>
In Somalia the U.S. discovered that the same force cannot act as a neutral peacekeeper and conduct coercive disarmament at the same time. It is a proven formula for disaster. Another lesson was that coercive and comprehensive disarmament very rapidly draws the coercer into the conflict. The initial American-led operation in Somalia gave American forces circumscribed and localized rules of engagement that allowed U.S. troops to disarm Somalis who immediately threatened U.S. operations. However, the nation-building mandate of the U.N.-led operation in Somalia greatly increased the mandate for disarmament, and in 1993 U.N. forces began aggressively to seek out the arms caches of warring factions in Mogadishu. This led directly to the disastrous street battle of October 3, 1993, in which 18 U.S. soldiers were killed and over 75 wounded. 
<p>
The only other option for a disarmament plan such as the one written into the Bosnian peace accord is to ignore those factions that refuse to disarm and hope that they choose to remain passive. This is what the United Nations did in Cambodia in 1992-1993. When the Khmer Rouge refused to honor the disarmament provisions of the Cambodian peace treaty, the U.N. commander knew it would be folly to try to coerce over 50,000 Khmer Rouge guerrillas into disarmament. The U.N. commander's plan instead was to "ride his luck"<sup>12</sup> and hope the Khmer Rouge did not disrupt the Cambodian elections or peace process. He knew that to pursue reluctant belligerents could draw his troops into a long, bloody, and fruitless contest. The same dilemma will confront the IFOR in Bosnia:  Pursue disarmament at great cost and risk escalating the fighting, or ignore intransigent belligerents and "hope" for their goodwill and cooperation.
<p>
In addition to these problems, any perception of American evenhandedness will be compromised by the plan to arm the Bosnian Muslims or Croats. European allies have strongly resisted the U.S. plan to arm and train the Muslims. However, the key to lasting peace in the Balkans is a local balance of power, and it is doubtful that this can be achieved without lifting the arms embargo (scheduled to be lifted 90 days after the peace accord is signed in Paris) and training the Muslims. Either way, the mission to "level the playing field" is fraught with difficulty for an outside party trying to create and sustain the subtleties of a local standoff in Bosnia.
<p>
<b>Q. Will the command and control structure worked out with the Russians stand up to the pressures of the mission? </b>
<p>
Command and control structures must be responsive, authoritative, rehearsed, and legitimate. Most important, they must be organized to handle the stress and strain of a "worst case scenario."  An authoritative command and control structure can offer a framework for action and response when military missions are faced with dangerous and contentious situations. The arrangement worked out with Russia looks reasonable on paper, but is likely to break down under pressure. Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev has stated that the Russian commander and the national authorities in Moscow have veto power over orders issued to the Russian contingent by the U.S. commander. This sort of arrangement can elevate tactical disagreements to a political level and exacerbate friction between the U.S. and Russia. The Administration would do well to heed an old military aphorism:  "If you cannot explain the command and control structure in less than 10 seconds, it isn't going to work."
<p>
Because goals and objectives are hard to define in a peace enforcement operation of this sort, European, American, and Russian policy could diverge to a great degree, as it has in the recent past. Much the same happened in Somalia. In the absence of clearly defined and measurable military goals, peace enforcement forces from different nations approached their mission in very different ways. This divergence caused the U.S. to insist on the removal of the Italian commander in Somalia. Imagine the imbroglios that could develop among the U.S., Russia, and the Europeans after NATO and Russian troops start dying in Bosnia. Peace enforcement is yet to be proven as a viable military concept, and its lack of conceptual and practical clarity means that when the shooting starts, everybody interprets the mandates in different ways. Failure to address these issues within a workable command and control framework could cause a further deterioration of alliance solidarity.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
Very serious questions remain about the recently concluded Bosnia peace accord. The political plan is admittedly tenuous, as evidenced by the fact that its implementation requires some 60,000 NATO combat troops. The fact is that this accord cannot succeed without clearly evident local support. Among the many questions that remain to be answered are those concerning the political viability of a hastily cobbled-together Bosnian state whose planned structure does not clearly address the fundamental political aims and concerns of the previously warring parties. A peace accord does not necessarily make the peace, and it must be remembered that some Nobel Prize-winning accords, such as the 1974 Vietnam peace settlement, have collapsed in ignominy because they did not address the basic issues at hand.
<p>
In addition, the military strategy of the peace implementation plan must undergo a rigorous examination to determine whether the objectives and modus operandi of the Implementation Force represent a sound and coherent plan for NATO. There is an inherent contradiction between the President's stated desire to keep the mission "clear, limited, and achievable" and the sweeping authority given to the NATO force in areas such as disarmament, refugee resettlement, and nation-building. In addition, contingency plans to address all manner of resistance must be addressed categorically. Calculations about costs, benefits, and the probability of success must be applied to all possible circumstances and discussed fully. 
<p>
The Bosnian peace plan is a tremendously risky enterprise. All of the factors involved in its implementation must be fully understood and debated before American lives and prestige are put on the line in Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<a href="bg1083a.html">Appendix</a>: Sample Resolution for Closing the Emerging  Gap Between U.S. Military Forces and Overseas Security Commitments<p> 
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Defending American freedom, security, and prosperity from foreign threats requires that America remain militarily strong and preserve its military alliances. It is no accident that the U.S. became involved in World War I and World War II during the first half of the 20th century when it was essentially a regional military power, still disinclined to exercise global leadership. Nor is it an accident that there have been no world wars and few major U.S. wars since America's emergence as a global power and leader of the West after 1945. The lesson of history is clear: The best way to keep the United States out of costly major wars is to remain a global power.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
America's status as a global power, however, could be in danger. The refusal of the Clinton Administration and Congress to provide adequate funding and other support for national security programs could leave the U.S. no longer able to make good on its commitments to military alliances in Europe, Asia, and elsewhere. Analysts at the Heritage Foundation estimate that the Clinton Administration is underfunding its defense plan for fiscal years 1997-2002 by some $130 billion. If not corrected, this shortfall will leave America with a serious mismatch between its security commitments and the military capabilities needed to fulfill those commitments. 
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The time is rapidly approaching when this mismatch may force the nation to abandon at least some of its security commitments. Indeed, the time is rapidly approaching when the U.S. will have to decide between remaining a global power capable of preventing wars or becoming a mere regional military power, condemned to fight and possibly lose them.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress needs to sound the alarm over this problem. Congress also needs to conduct a serious debate on how to close the gap. One solution would be to pledge the nation to honor its existing security commitments and propose increasing the defense budget over projected levels to meet these commitments. If Congress and the Administration are not willing to support a defense budget and force levels sufficient to honor U.S. security commitments, they will leave America with only one feasible course of action: partial withdrawal from existing U.S. security commitments while projected defense spending levels are held steady.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This second approach is not a solution, but an evasion. It would mean the end of America as a global military power capable of defending its freedom and interests. And it would mean the beginning of a new age of insecurity of the sort that Americans have not known since the first half of this century.
<p>
<b>U.S. SECURITY COMMITMENTS AND MILITARY CAPABILITIES: THE COMING MISMATCH</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At the heart of the emerging mismatch between U.S. military capabilities and security commitments is declining funding for defense. Since 1985, U.S. defense spending has declined by about 35 percent (through the end of the last fiscal year, or FY 1995). Both Administration and congressional budget proposals would result in an FY 2002 defense budget that is between 6 percent and 8 percent below the level prevailing in 1995 (see <a href="bg1083c1.gif">Chart 1</a>). Reductions of this magnitude mean that the force structure recommended by the Clinton Administration's Bottom-Up Review cannot be sustained.<sup>1</sup>  In fact, the defense budget proposed by the Clinton Administration for fiscal years 1997 through 2002 falls roughly $130 billion short of what is required for the President's proposed force structure. In other words, the Clinton Administration is failing to fund its own defense force, and the size of the U.S. armed forces will shrink to levels below those recommended in the Administration's own Bottom-Up Review (see <a href="bg1083c2.gif">Chart 2</a>).
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Clinton Administration and defense critics in Congress have explained the reduction in resources for the military as a natural result of the end of the Cold War. However, while defense budgets and force structure have diminished, U.S. security commitments have not changed. These commitments are derived from such important security treaties as the Washington Treaty of 1949 establishing the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Japanese-United States Mutual Cooperation and Security Treaties of 1951 and 1960 (see <a href="bg1083c3.gif">Chart 3</a>). Other non-treaty commitments, such as those to U.S. friends in the Persian Gulf, also remain in force. In addition, at the same time President Clinton is cutting defense, he is seeking to expand the level of American military commitments by increasing U.S. participation in peacekeeping and peace enforcement operations and expanding NATO membership to qualifying states in Eastern Europe.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
All of these commitments place an extraordinary drain on the resources of the armed services. The Clinton Administration's policy calls for the Army to have ten active divisions, but the Administration's underfunding is likely to force down the number of active divisions to eight. U.S. security commitments to the countries of the Persian Gulf (in this case non-treaty commitments) oblige the U.S. to confront an attack on its friends in the region by either Iraq or Iran. As a result of this commitment, America could find itself fighting another Persian Gulf War, say in 2005. But sending the same number of active Army combat divisions to a future war in the Persian Gulf as were sent in 1990/91 would require more than seven divisions -- at least 70 percent of active Army divisions called for under the Bottom-Up Review, and 87 percent of the active divisions likely to result from Clinton Administration budget policy. Similar demands would exist for the combat forces of the other services (see <a href="bg1083c4.gif">Chart 4</a>).
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The demand placed on military support systems by U.S. security commitments cannot be quantified as easily, because such support systems as strategic lift, worldwide communications, and intelligence are global in scope and can be used to support combat forces in several regions concurrently. Nevertheless, it is accurate to say that the cost of developing and procuring this global infrastructure is based on the worldwide scope of U.S. commitments and is very expensive. For example, the Pentagon has spent roughly $6 billion annually on developing, procuring, and operating its airlift and sealift systems during the 1990s.<sup>2</sup>
<p>
<b>THE FINANCIAL COST OF U.S. MILITARY LEADERSHIP: THE PERSIAN GULF WAR MODEL</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Some critics of defense spending are quick to point out that the U.S. defense budget is three times larger than any other country's. They make this point to convince both Congress and the American people that the defense budget can be reduced safely from projected levels without jeopardizing U.S. security commitments. This assumes, however, that the U.S. needs to spend only as much as--or slightly more than--other states on defense, particularly regional bullies like Iraq or North Korea. This assumption is wrong. The U.S. needs to spend much more than three times the amount spent by rogue states in order to uphold its commitments to its allies in important regions. The history of the Persian Gulf War demonstrates why.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
History shows that from 1988-1990, the U.S. had to spend annually some seven times as much as Iraq to defeat Saddam Hussein in Kuwait (see <a href="bg1083c5.gif">Chart 5</a>).<sup>3</sup>  The reasons: 
<ul><p>
<li>The U.S. needs to meet commitments on a global basis, which requires greater spending on overseas bases, logistical support, airlift, and other military infrastructure. By contrast, rogue regimes need only threaten a U.S. commitment in one region, which is considerably cheaper.
<p>
<li>American military forces need to project power to regions thousands of miles from American shores, while the militaries of rogue regimes have only to operate in close proximity to their own territories. 
<p>
<li>The U.S. requires a high-technology force to defeat its enemies with limited casualties. By contrast, rogue regimes have fewer high-tech military systems and care little for the loss of human life on either side. 
<p>
<li>The U.S. chooses to retain a more expensive all-volunteer force as opposed to a conscript army of the sort retained by Iraq.
</ul><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If America wishes to remain a global power -- and it must if it wishes to protect its own freedom and security -- it must accept the burden of paying much more for its own defense than would its adversaries. U.S. forces are not "overstuffed."<sup>4</sup>  They are, if anything, already growing too weak to meet the challenging task of outgunning rogue states that have the luxury of spending less on defense than does the U.S. In this respect, rogue states are to the U.S. as an arsonist is to a fire insurance company: The arsonist, with his gasoline and matches, can spend much less than the insurance company, which either must focus on fire prevention or pay the cost of rebuilding a house burned down by the arsonist.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This cost, though high, must be borne by the U.S. It was the price of victory in the Gulf War, and it will be the price of victory in similar wars in the future. U.S. friends and allies, like Kuwait, understand that if America does not make the necessary investments to protect its regional interests, it will be unable to fulfill its commitments. This is why reductions in the defense budget threaten to undermine U.S. security commitments. As friends and allies like Kuwait question American commitment, they may begin to seek security elsewhere. These commitments are more than an academic question for U.S. friends and allies: As any Kuwaiti will attest, their very existence as sovereign states may hang in the balance.
<p>
<b>ANSWERING THE QUESTION ABOUT U.S. SECURITY COMMITMENTS</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Since the end of the Cold War, there has been no debate about whether the U.S. should continue to uphold its existing security commitments to friends and allies around the world. As a result, defense budgets and military forces have been shrinking without consideration for the potential impact on the alliance structure. The Clinton Administration is largely responsible for this state of affairs. First, it failed to fund its own defense policy. Second, it altered internal accounts in the Pentagon budget to fund daily military operations at the direct expense of its ability to buy new weapons for the future. This has allowed the Administration to retain a conventional force that for the last several years is larger than the budget otherwise would allow. As pressure to buy new weapons builds, so does the pressure to reduce the size of the force to free up money for new weapons.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress, however, has exacerbated the problem. The budget resolution approved last year, covering fiscal years 1996 through 2002, added more funds for defense each year for fiscal years 1996 through 2000. Nevertheless, at the end of the seven-year period, in fiscal 2001 and 2002, Congress would spend less on defense than would the Clinton Administration. Further, even the $7 billion increase in defense expenditures Congress provided for the current fiscal year is not enough to fund the Clinton Administration's Bottom-Up Review force structure. Putting the Pentagon on a path that funds both the readiness and    modernization needs of the military would require an increase of somewhat less than $20 billion.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One can only speculate about the sort of ugly reality the American people will have to face sometime during the next five years if Clinton Administration defense policies continue on their present course: for example, a Chinese invasion of Taiwan, the disintegration of NATO, an invasion of South Korea by the North, Russian hegemony over the "near abroad," or Iranian military control of the Persian Gulf. All that is needed is for the U.S. to be perceived as militarily weak and unable to uphold its security commitments in Asia, Europe, and the Persian Gulf. Clearly, the time has come for Congress to clarify this situation for the American people.
<p>
<b>CALL TO DEBATE</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The best way for Congress to educate the American people about the emerging gap between U.S. security commitments and forces is to debate the issue. The mere fact that Congress is debating the issue will serve to bring home to the American people that there is a serious problem. As of now, they cannot know because the Clinton Administration refuses to acknowledge that the problem exists. As the American people become aware of the emerging gap, the likelihood that the Clinton Administration will be forced to address it increases. Then, and only then, can the gap between forces and commitments be closed.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Congress also can propose a resolution to uphold U.S. security commitments by increasing projected defense budgets to fund the Clinton Administration's Bottom-Up Review force. Even with the additional funding, however, Congress would be required to propose a riskier strategy than the one proposed in the Bottom-Up Review. The resolution should admit this by asserting that, at best, the Bottom-Up Review force is capable of handling one major regional conflict (similar to the Persian Gulf War) and one minor regional conflict (similar to the 1989 invasion of Panama) simultaneously, as opposed to two major regional conflicts "nearly simultaneously" (a sample draft resolution can be found in the appendix to this paper).<sup>5</sup>
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Currently projected defense budgets have America on a forced march along the path to military weakness and withdrawal. The alarming thing is that the American people are not aware that the nation is headed in this direction. A congressional debate over the future of U.S. security commitments is needed to start the process of educating the American people about this potentially life-or-death issue. The debate should be on a resolution that puts Congress on record as saying that America does not go back on its commitments to its friends and allies. Further, this resolution would make it clear that Congress will continue to provide the military resources, above the Clinton Administration's requested levels, needed to back these commitments.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Clinton Administration and its allies in Congress will deny that they wish to abrogate America's commitments to its friends and allies. But in this respect, their actions speak louder than their words. The American people need to know that a choice must be made and that the President and Congress so far have not made it. Hanging in the balance is whether America will or will not be a global power capable of defending its own interests and freedom, which requires it to meet its security commitments to its allies and friends around the world.

<h3>CLINTON'S BOSNIA VENTURE THREATENS WHAT IT IS SUPPOSED TO UPHOLD -- THE ATLANTIC ALLIANCE</h3>

Backgrounder Update No. 267<br>
December 15, 1995<br>
<p>
(Updating Backgrounder No. 1012, "Don't Let Bosnia Destroy NATO," December 28, 1994.)
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
A year ago, The Heritage Foundation warned that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's credibility was being severely damaged by subordination of its Bosnian peace enforcement efforts to an impotent and ineffective United Nations (UNPROFOR) command structure. At the same time, Heritage warned that misguided attempts to salvage NATO's credibility by "Americanizing" the Balkan conflict could destroy the alliance, because it would impose a responsibility which NATO was not designed to handle.<sup>1</sup> <p>
Today, as a result of the <a href="http://www.state.gov/www/current/bosnia/bosagree.html">Dayton peace agreement</a>, the Bosnia war is being Americanized. Advance parties of U.S. and allied troops already are in Bosnia or on their way. Now that the formal peace agreement has been signed in Paris, the U.S. First Armored Division will begin moving from Germany into northeast Bosnia. In all, some 60,000 NATO troops, including upwards of 20,000 Americans and contingents from 11 non-NATO countries, will take part in the Bosnian Implementation Force (IFOR). This number does not include the even larger logistical "tail," as well as naval and air units, that will be dedicated to supporting U.S. elements on the ground. 
<p>
This massive deployment of American ground forces for a peacekeeping mission -- one in which there is no emergency, no threat to U.S. lives, and no immediate national security interest at stake -- is unprecedented. Nevertheless, it is going forward. On Decemer 13 the Senate offered qualified and grudging support for the troops and mission in Bosnia, while the House backed the troops but opposed the President's policy.
<P>
Deploying 20,000 U.S. troops to IFOR is highly risky and unnecessary. But the Clinton Administration painted the United States into a corner with ill-considered promises of ground troops and by making U.S. participation in the peacekeeping force a condition of the Dayton peace framework. Once these commitments were on the table, the Administration found it necessary to invoke the sanctity of U.S. commitments, America's credibility and prestige, and the continued strength of the Atlantic alliance in order to sell the deployment to Congress. For these reasons, Congress had no choice but to offer its support at least for U.S. troops in Bosnia.
<p>
The IFOR commitment, entered into hastily and without thoughtful analysis, is, in the words of former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, an example of a vital national interest which has been "self-created."<sup>2</sup>  But this is the hand that has been dealt, and the U.S. must play it out as best it can. Though there are risks in going into Bosnia, the Clinton Administration's intellectual confusion and incompetent statecraft have set up a situation in which there also are penalties if America turns its back on NATO and the allies at this stage. The U.S. has to weigh the actual and certain damage of reneging on its promises against the potential and uncertain damage if the mission should fail at some future point. Presented with a wholly unnecessary <i>fait accompli</i>, the Congress now must support American troops while expressing strong reservations about the Bosnia mission, laying down markers for its success or failure, and establishing some clear guidelines for implementation of the peace plan.
<p>
The President once again has led the nation into a foreign policy <i>cul de sac</i> with no good choices. American and allied soldiers in IFOR may lose their lives, all in the name of "preserving NATO."  Since public opposition to the U.S. role in IFOR is both broad and deep, the Administration's Bosnian sales pitch may well result in loss of public support for the NATO alliance as IFOR casualties mount. 
<p>
As the U.S. wades deeper into this proverbial quagmire, it is time to look at past mistakes and future risks. The nation's leaders must make sure this mission does not turn into another Somalia episode, destroying the very things it is supposed to uphold -- U.S. leadership, credibility, prestige, the sanctity of U.S. commitments, and especially the health of the Western alliance.
<p>

<b>Correcting the Administration's Mistakes</b>
<p>
The Clinton Administration has made some serious mistakes in its policy on Bosnia. The President and Congress should correct these mistakes in the coming days and weeks.
<p>
<b>Mistake #1:  Linking the Implementation Force to NATO</b><br>
The President must stop making IFOR a test case for NATO, and the Administration must begin to anticipate what will happen to public support for NATO as a result of this policy linkage if the Bosnia mission results in the loss of U.S. soldiers and a premature withdrawal. Such an outcome would be far more destructive of NATO than a U.S. refusal to commit ground troops to IFOR at the outset. NATO is more important to the U.S. than IFOR, and American public support for NATO must transcend the ups and downs of this peace implementation mission.
<p>
<b>Mistake #2:  De Facto Changes in the North Atlantic Treaty</b><br>
Having experienced the failure of the UNPROFOR command arrangement, the Administration refused to deploy U.S. troops to Bosnia under the United Nations. This was a wise move. Only a tried and true military command structure, one in which the U.S. is the dominant military partner, is acceptable for U.S. troops in potential danger. Putting IFOR under NATO was the only practical choice.
<p>
However, in sending troops on a peace enforcement mission to Bosnia under NATO, the Administration has turned the North Atlantic Treaty into something other than a mutual defense treaty. Article 5 of the treaty explicitly makes NATO a defensive alliance:  An attack upon one is an attack upon all. It does not authorize out-of-area peacekeeping operations. 
<p>
The Administration must begin to address the impact of unilaterally stretching the fabric of the Atlantic alliance beyond what it will bear. If the North Atlantic Treaty is going to be converted into something other than a mutual defense treaty that leads to more Bosnia-like missions in the future, then the American people (as well as the other 15 member nations of NATO) have the right to approve. In America's case, approval should come through the advise-and-consent treaty prerogative of the U.S. Senate under the Constitution.
<p>
<b>Mistake #3: Confusion Over Ends and Means</b><br>
	NATO has never been an end in itself, but a means to achieve the collective defense of its members. As such, it is still immensely important and worth preserving. However, since the threat and the historical conditions which gave birth to NATO have changed dramatically, NATO cannot expect to remain the same and still be relevant to the security needs of Europe and the strategic interests of the United States. Those needs still exist, even if in different form, and must be articulated clearly by the President and his national security leadership. By invoking NATO to justify an unpopular IFOR mission, the Administration has confused this equation and made NATO the end in itself. That argument will not be sustainable if things in Bosnia go wrong. If the IFOR mission fails, it will be seen as a failure of NATO. Questions then will be raised about the efficacy and necessity of NATO. As a result, perhaps America's most important military alliance will have been put in jeopardy.
<p>
<b>Mistake #4: Neglecting the Selection of NATO's Secretary General</b><br>
The Administration either acquiesced in, or actively participated in, the short-sighted decision to pick Spanish Foreign Minister Javier Solana as NATO's new Secretary General. Solana, a leading Spanish Socialist, opposed Spain's entry into NATO and was active in trying to expel the U.S. from NATO air bases in Spain. While he may have experienced a "confirmation conversion," American supporters of NATO are entitled to be skeptical of the selection of a man with marginal qualifications and whose country is not part of NATO's integrated command structure, especially at what is perhaps the most critical moment in NATO's recent history. 
<p>
The Administration is willing to send 20,000 U.S. soldiers into potential combat "in order to preserve NATO," but it was not willing to insist on -- or even recruit, if necessary -- a highly qualified and credible Secretary General from a country which is part of the integrated military command. It is too late now to make another choice, but it is not too late for the United States to demand that the new Secretary General:
<p><ul>
<li> Respect the essential military nature of NATO as a defensive alliance. Efforts to get NATO involved in "nation building" and other civilian activities should be resisted, while attempts formally to change NATO's charter to deal with peacekeeping and other quasi-military missions should be discouraged;
<p>
<li> Assert NATO's primacy in the implementation of the Bosnia peace accord to insure that refugee matters and nation-building activity by the U.N. and the Organization for Security and Cooperations in Europe do not interfere with military operations under NATO;
<p>
<li> Defer to NATO's Supreme Military Commander in all matters related to IFOR military operations; and
<p>
<li> Support robust rules of engagement and aggressive force protection measures.
</ul><p>
<b>Mistake #5: Turning the U.S. Armed Services into a Constabulary Force</b><br>
The principal mission of the U.S. armed forces is to fight and win America's wars. This mission requires continuous, arduous, and dedicated training. In contrast, the Clinton Administration has demonstrated a peculiar propensity toward using U.S. military forces for peacekeeping, peace enforcement, humanitarian, and other non-traditional missions while neglecting to provide the resources and commitment needed to keep them in the best fighting trim. In effect, the Administration, led by a commander in chief notoriously inexperienced in foreign and defense policy, is in danger of turning America's combat-ready forces into a constabulary force and NATO into a regional policing organization. If NATO is to remain viable, its primary mission must remain self-defense and deterrence, not peacekeeping and peace enforcement.
<p>
One of the greatest concerns of U.S. Army commanders being deployed to Bosnia is the inevitable erosion of their units' combat skills, which demand constant and rigorous training to keep honed. The U.S. deployment to Bosnia requires the great majority of the ground combat strength of U.S. forces in Europe. Upon returning to their bases in Germany from Bosnia, these troops will need many months to retrain and regain the warfighting skills that will atrophy during the IFOR mission. This effectively puts the U.S. Army in Europe out of the warfighting business for at least two years. The problem was highlighted recently in a General Accounting Office report charting the deleterious and alarming effects of peace operations on combat readiness.<sup>3</sup>  After a year in Bosnia on peacekeeping duty, the U.S. First Armored Division, now arguably the best, most combat-ready heavy division in the world, will no longer be at a state of readiness to perform its warfighting mission should a crisis erupt in another part of the world.
 <p><b>"Inoculating" NATO Against Failure in Bosnia</b><p>
In addition to correcting these mistakes, there are several steps the Administration and Congress should take to inoculate NATO against the possible failure of IFOR. The ambiguities and contradictions inherent in the peace accord and the military plan have exposed the contrary and clashing ambitions of the allies. The Administration must end the rhetorical oversell, begin a serious assessment of these inherent deficiencies, and develop strategies to deal with them as they become evident on the ground. Above all, the U.S. should take the lead in assuring that the cracks now appearing in NATO's approach to IFOR will not widen as this poorly planned mission proceeds. The first priority is to ensure a political and military unity of effort among the NATO allies.
<P>
<b>Getting Political Unity Among the Allies.</b>
<p>
 America and Europe have fundamentally different policy approaches to the Bosnian problem that transcend the provisions of the peace accord initialed in Dayton. The first and most obvious disagreement is over goals, end-states, and commitment. America's European allies, having been on the ground in the former Yugoslavia for the better part of the four-year war, understand that a long-term commitment is needed to address this enigmatic and intractable conflict. In the face of extended European commitment to the long-term rehabilitation of war-torn Bosnian society, the Clinton Administration has proposed a plan that has U.S. troops redeploying within nine or ten months. It is obvious to the European allies that, for the U.S., the "exit strategy is the mission. That is, the mission is to show up and leave, not to stay until the goals are fully achieved."<sup>4</sup>
<p>
According to the timetable laid out in the Dayton peace accords, the period when U.S. troops will be ready to redeploy will be the most crucial and fragile period in the peace implementation plan. It is at this time that the critical issues of disarmament, refugee resettlement, elections, and the political formation of an elaborate central Bosnian government all will be coming to the fore. It is also at this time that the U.S. commitment will be waning.
<p>
The second policy disagreement concerns arming and training the Bosnian Muslims, a policy the European NATO partners have resisted vigorously throughout the conflict. If the expected scenario is played out, nine or ten months into this operation, American troops will be redeploying and European forces will be manning the buffer zone and assisting in nation-building while the U.S. is sponsoring the arming and training of the Bosnian army. The International Institute of Strategic Studies in London recently noted that this "will not only undermine the impartiality which IFOR is now insisting on, but it will certainly encourage, if that was ever needed, Croat and Serb forces to maintain their own arsenals."<sup>5</sup>
<p>
Clearly, such fundamental policy disagreements need to be addressed thoroughly before more soldiers set foot on the ground. Otherwise, much as disagreement over disarmament did in Somalia, the issue will work to split the alliance and bring down the mission. America and her allies have a peace accord and a peace implementation plan. They do not have full agreement on a final political settlement, intermediate and long-term objectives, criteria for success, and a road map to get there.
<p>
<b>Getting Military Unity Among the Allies.</b>
<p>
 NATO is one of the few military alliances with a consistent, reliable, and rehearsed common doctrine as well as standard operating procedures. However, this common doctrine is no assurance of a common approach to the military aspects of the peace implementation mission. It is a challenge in any multinational mission to ensure that a common tactical and operational approach is used by all forces. This challenge increases by leaps and bounds in a mission that has ill-defined goals, objectives, and end-states. As noted above, the Bosnia implementation plan is not well-defined enough to ensure a unified and common approach to operations.
<p>
In the U.N. operation in Somalia, the forces involved operated under standard rules of engagement and a common operational plan, and yet there were great differences in interpreting military actions in this peace-enforcement mission. In Somalia, the U.S. had its most significant differences with another NATO ally -- Italy -- and even demanded the United Nations fire the Italian military commander after he publicly criticized the American contingent's aggressive approach to operations. Common doctrine in a contentious mission by no means guarantees unity of effort. A disagreement over tactics and operations easily can lead to a splintering of the mission.
<p>
In Bosnia, the U.S., French, British, Russian, and 19 other military contingents (both NATO and non-NATO) also will interpret the mission and rules of engagement differently. America's European allies tend to operate with much greater restraint and patience as a result of their long experience with these types of missions. They eschew both the emphasis on disproportionate and overwhelming force by the U.S.<sup>6</sup>  and the wanton use of force by the Russians in conflicts such as Chechnya. In fact, a recent British military report emphasized that "American doctrine currently lacks the subtlety required for internal conflict and is in danger of being associated with an inexact and counter-productive use of force."<sup>7</sup>  The European allies are not nearly as impatient or intolerant of casualties as the U.S. and are willing to bear far greater restraints for longer periods of time in these types of missions.<p><b>NATO Expansion.</b><br> One of the most profound ways the Administration can inoculate NATO against failure in Bosnia is to embark upon a coherent and thoughtful program of NATO expansion. This will give the alliance new life and energy, and will reassert its role as a mutual security treaty by integrating the new democratic states of East and Central Europe.
<p>
NATO has been the foundation of European security for 45 years, possibly the most successful such alliance in history. The U.S. should support a renewed and enlarged NATO because it guarantees an American presence on the European continent and a "seat at the table" in the world's most vital, productive region. The United States has clear, abiding, and vital interests in Europe. Europe is the soil where America's deepest roots are found. America is bound to Europe by innumerable links of trade, finance, communications, and technology exchange; ties of history, culture, and shared values; and nearly five decades of mutual security arrangements. 
<p>
A free and stable Europe has always been essential to the United States. In the 20th century, the U.S. has intervened in two bloody world wars to prevent the domination of Europe by aggressive dictatorships. Moreover, America paid a high price for 45 years of Cold War to prevent the domination of Europe and the Eurasian landmass by communist imperialism. This involvement and stabilizing presence have made the U.S. in effect a European power. Americans cannot cut themselves off from Europe without doing harm to the U.S. as a world power, and as a people.
<p>
Europe cannot remain stable and prosperous, to the mutual benefit of the U.S. and the European allies, if its post-Cold War boundary is drawn along the borders of Germany and Austria. Such an artificial division would leave a power vacuum in East Central Europe and consign millions of people who share America's democratic values and aspirations to an uncertain fate. A new European security framework will not hold up unless it reflects the realities of the political upheaval that marked the end of the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact. That new reality includes the re-orienting of former East Bloc states toward the West.
<p>
There are other reasons to enlarge NATO-- for example, to lessen internal tensions between members and facilitate the resolution of conflicts-- but the U.S. must not lose sight of the fact that NATO has been successful because it was a defensive alliance. Turning it into something else could weaken it fatally. At the very least, changing the nature of NATO, as the Administration is doing in Bosnia, requires debate in Congress. Unless America understands that NATO's underlying and abiding purpose remains to defend Europe, the burdens of the alliance over time will cause NATO to crumble.
<p>

<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
Because the Bosnian peace implementation plan is weak and ambiguous in many of its military provisions, there is a great possibility that several major policy imbroglios could develop between the U.S. and its NATO allies. As British strategist William Shawcross recently noted in <i>The Times</i> of London, "A real danger is that, although the Dayton agreement provides a chance to end the war, its complexities, its contradictions and the different if not conflicting ambitions of the Allies mean that it, too, may be seen to fail. That would be an even more serious failure than that of the UN. It would be the defeat of NATO, and of the Western Alliance."<sup>8</sup> <p><b>What Congress Should Do </b><p>Deep opposition to the IFOR deployment exists in both political parties and in both houses of Congress. But at this stage, the 104th Congress has been unwilling to challenge the President's constitutional prerogatives as commander in chief, either by a statutory prohibition of U.S. participation in IFOR or by cutting off funds, both of which are within Congress's power. Once American forces are deployed on missions where hostile action is possible, Congress usually is reluctant to endanger them or undermine their success by making the mission the object of a domestic political struggle. The Administration, counting on this traditional support for the troops, was confident its Bosnia <i>fait accompli</i> would survive congressional action.
<p>
On December 13, the Senate voted 69-30 in favor of the Dole-McCain resolution, which supports the men and women in uniform but "does not endorse the President's decision ...[or] the agreement reached in Dayton," according to Majority Leader Dole. The House, which had voted to cut off funds for the Bosnia mission, was even more forceful, voting 287-141 to condemn the mission while expressing support for the troops being deployed. This tepid endorsement provides political distance for Members of Congress should the President's Bosnian intervention result in catastrophic failure. 
<p>
But expressing support for the troops while criticizing the Dayton plan and IFOR's mission does not end Congress's responsibility. Congress simply cannot wash its hands of the issue and cede all responsibility to a President who has shown such ineptness in foreign and defense policy. If Members believe the IFOR mission is dangerously flawed, they have a responsibility to continue their efforts to mitigate the dangers. This would demonstrate actual and not just rhetorical support for the troops facing possible death or injury in Bosnia.
<p>
How should Congress respond to the Administration's <i>fait accompli</i>?  First, Congress should continue to exercise its oversight responsibility by reviewing the mistakes that led to the "boxing in" of the United States so that no choice was left but to proceed with such a risky and unnecessary venture. Second, it should assess the ambiguities and deficiencies in the Bosnia peace plan that could jeopardize success -- and thus harm NATO and U.S. credibility.<sup>9</sup>  Third, it should consider future legislation building on the momentum and principles established in the December 13 House and Senate votes and designed to achieve the following: <p><ul><li> Lay down additional markers by which success or failure can be measured. This would help prevent "mission creep" and provide further basis for an exit strategy.

<li> Establish some basic guidelines for implementing the agreement. This could include such do's and don'ts as:  a) avoid trying coercively to disarm unthreatening factions; b) refuse to get involved in nation-building or to police civilian activities; c) avoid trying to guarantee either the return of refugees or certain outcomes in elections; d) resist the temptation to launch military operations in search of alleged war criminals; and e) use overwhelming force when challenged.

<li> Express strong support for NATO and NATO expansion. The President has implied that opposition to the Dayton plan is tantamount to weakening the credibility of America's commitment to NATO. Congress should make it clear that this is not true. In no way should the reservations of Congress be interpreted as doubting the validity or credibility of NATO. A vote of confidence in NATO and for expanding the alliance not only would help to deflect the President's unfair and unwise depiction of doubters as isolationists or opponents of NATO, but also would help to inoculate NATO against the fallout of the possible failure in Bosnia that so many in Congress fully expect.
</ul><p>
Opposing IFOR is not equivalent to isolationism or opposition to NATO. In fact, it may turn out to be the Clinton Administration's misguided adventurism that destroys NATO. The President has embarked upon a hazardous course for good or ill; he alone is now responsible to the American people for what happens. But he needs to be reminded, even as Americans defer to his role as commander in chief, that U.S. credibility and prestige are too valuable to be squandered or debased by improper use.

<title>How Government Wastes Your Money #2 - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>
<h3>HOW GOVERNMENT WASTES YOUR MONEY: REPORT NO. 2</h3>
Compiled by <a href="/heritage/staff/utt.html">Ronald D. Utt, Ph.D.</a><sup>1</sup><br>
Senior Fellow<br>
<br><a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 112<br>
July 23, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%>
</center>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The statement that "If you like laws and sausages, you should never watch either one being made" is attributed to Prince Otto von Bismarck, Chancellor of Germany during the late 19th century. Were he alive today, he might want to add "government management" to that list. It also is not a pretty sight, and no one seems much interested in cleaning up the mess.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The fact is that, notwithstanding all sorts of promises to the contrary by elected officials of both parties, in Congress and in the White House, egregious instances of costly waste continue throughout the government and all too often survive the budget ax while important spending plans are scrapped. Consider the following recent examples drawn from the government's own studies and reports:
<p>
<b>Beach Blanket Boondoggle</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The invitation to the 1995 convention of the National Tenant Organization (NTO) at the San Juan, Puerto Rico, Casino Hotel and Sands Beach Resort reads like any vacation brochure: "We promise you a vacation that will be unforgettable!!  Casino's for Dads. Beaches, Swimming, Snorkeling, Dancing, & Touring etc... for youths. Exotic Shopping, Beauty Salon for complete pampering for Moms. Appetizing, Savory, Delicious foods for the Family Meals."
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The only problem is that this boondoggle occurred in the guise of a training session for 260 public housing tenants, public housing officials, and employees of the <a href="http://www.hud.gov">U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development</a> that was both sponsored and funded by HUD. It cost the U.S. taxpayer an estimated $325,000, according to HUD's own Inspector General in a February 29, 1996, report to Congress.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Although HUD officials denied any agency involvement when first questioned by Congress, the department's independent Inspector General subsequently concluded that "HUD officials played a key role in planning and conducting NTO's 1995 National Convention in Puerto Rico."<sup>2</sup>  And although conference sponsors contend the event was educational in nature, the Inspector General found otherwise, concluding that "The video recordings of actual convention events show the poor organization and lack of programmatic substance at the convention."  The official watchdog further commented that "The videos of convention events also show the political nature of the convention," noting that the government employee who was translating from English to Spanish withdrew in the middle of a session because he believed that it was inappropriate for a federal employee to be involved in such a partisan event. It seems that his superiors did not show the same good judgment.

Although the ValuJet crash focused the public's attention on the <a href="http://www.dot.gov">Department of Transportation</a>'s questionable enforcement of air safety standards, a recent report by DOT's Inspector General found similar failures in the Federal Transit Administration's Bus Testing Program. This program is operated for DOT and FTA by university faculty and graduate students at two Pennsylvania test facilities. The IG's report concluded that "FTA procedures were not adequate to ensure new bus models were tested as required; deficiencies existed in tests for structural integrity, performance and fuel economy."<sup>3</sup>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Specifically, as noted in the report, "at least ten new bus models, involving $44.5 million in federal funds, were operating without having been tested."  The report also suggested that the government might be able to recover $350,000 due to questionable personnel costs. These costs included salaries paid to eight graduate students who were not working on the project, payments to the principal investigator after he was replaced, and salary paid to a facilities manager after he was reassigned to other duties. This report has been available to the DOT and to Congress for more than two years. But according to the Inspector General, DOT has not yet resolved the allegations raised in the report; nor has it recovered the money.

<b>Dialing With Your Dollars</b>
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Each year the <a href="http://www.usda.gov">Department of Agriculture</a> spends more than $50 million to provide telephone service for its 105,000 employees, but a costly portion of that spending represents employee phone abuse that Department officials ignored despite earlier warnings from the U.S. General Accounting Office.<sup>4</sup>  The GAO also discovered that the USDA continued to pay for telephone service for field offices that had been closed for more than a year.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

How bad is the abuse?  During a four month period examined by the GAO, about half of all collect calls received by USDA employees, amounting to more than 600 calls costing $2,600, were from inmates at 18 jails or prisons. Many of these calls were rerouted illegally by USDA employees to other USDA long-distance lines.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

According to the GAO, the USDA had been aware of the inmate abuse since 1994 but did nothing to stop it. The same GAO review found that numerous calls were being made from Agriculture Department phones to adult chat lines that offer sexually explicit entertainment, and that a number of these involved expensive international calls, many to the Dominican Republic. The GAO was unable to determine to what extent these sex-related calls were made by rerouted, collect-calling inmates.

The notion that the government should fund self-sustaining, indigenous culture and art like the North Dallas Square Dance Club or the Out of Town Blues Band at Washington's New Vegas Lounge probably would strike most Americans as both silly and wasteful. Yet this is exactly what the National Endowment for the Arts has been doing -- but only if the artistic activity is indigenous to foreign countries -- at a cost to the American taxpayer of hundreds of thousands of dollars per year in the dance category alone.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Should taxpayers subsidize Mexican folk dancing?  The NEA thinks so. It gave $40,000 in 1994 (the most recent year for which spending details are available) to Floricanto Dance Theater, Academia de Danza y Folklore Mexicano, Raices de Mexico, and Los Lupenos de San Jose. It seems that even Japanese folk dancing needs taxpayer help. The NEA gave $10,000 to the Tokunagu Dance Ko. and the Jo Ha Kyu Performance Group.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The list goes on and on, including the New York Chinese Cultural Center, Dancing and Drums of Africa, and $20,000 to the Capoeira Foundation (Brazilian dance). Traditional Philippine dance was supported through the Samahan Philippine Dance Company and Kulintang Arts Inc., while groups pursuing dance cultures of undetermined ethnicity such as the Najwa Dance Corps, Sharir Dance Company, and Zivili Kolo Ensemble reflect the dozens of dance clubs that received taxpayer support.

<b>A Knockout Punch to the Taxpayer</b>

Faced with imminent fiscal collapse, the District of Columbia government has cut back on many vital social services and has been forced to surrender much of its executive authority to an independent control board as a pre-condition for any taxpayer bailout, now averaging $3,898 for each and every District resident. But these reforms have not extended to D.C.'s Boxing and Wrestling Commission -- a money loser thanks to mismanagement and a limited number of poorly attended professional fights. Sharing responsibility for D.C.'s few professional fights with the D.C. Sports Commission, the Boxing Commission normally is supposed to be funded by an excise tax on gate receipts and revenues from pay-per-view boxing matches shown over local cable television. But the District of Columbia Auditor found that the Commission generally fails to collect the required taxes and operates at a loss: more than $26,000 over the past two years.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The Commission has failed to collect the necessary taxes in every year between 1991 and 1995. Much of the shortfall reflects both the Commission's inability to collect taxes owed by the local cable TV monopoly and its mismanagement of live fights. This occurs despite the fact that the financially pressed District government spends more than $2 million per year on the Office of Cable Television, whose duties include monitoring the company's compliance with the terms and conditions of its franchise agreement. Last year, the unauthorized distribution of complimentary tickets to the "Million Man March Fights" by one of the Commission's officials led the promoter of the event to withhold his tax payment. Had the District collected the boxing fees it was owed and operated the Commission on a break-even basis, it would have had enough money to repair dozens of its growing inventory of disabled police cars.

Americans are increasingly aware of well-documented failings within the <a href="http://www.faa.gov">Federal Aviation Administration</a>-operated air traffic control system, which is responsible for safely guiding airplanes in flight, as well as through takeoffs and landings.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

America's government-operated air traffic control system lurches from one costly equipment failure to another, most recently with a new sophisticated radar system designed to detect dangerous wind conditions. Expected to cost $373 million when installed at 47 airports, the new system has suffered frequent shutdowns and failures at the 16 airports where it already is in place. At Washington's National Airport, for example, the new system has failed nearly once a week since it was installed in January 1996, and its failure to detect unsafe wind conditions contributed to a potentially dangerous situation where strong winds caused a plane's wing to hit a runway light on takeoff.
<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Persistent failure of costly equipment is nothing new with the FAA. Other recent occurrences include a power surge blamed on a squirrel, which took down the Cleveland airport's radar for a week; a new system in Pasco, Washington, that could track cars in driveways but sometimes missed planes; Tampa controllers who complained of "black holes" on their screens, with planes disappearing for two or three miles; and lost power in the New York City area system that grounded 200 planes while another 37 were in the air -- one pilot used on-board telephones to contact the New York ground controllers. Also occurring over the past year were multiple radar failures in Ft. Lauderdale and Miami, Florida; Baltimore, Maryland; Minneapolis, Minnesota; Washington, D.C.; San Juan, Puerto Rico; Gardena, California; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Between May 1993 and June 1995, the Long Island control facility that guides planes over the North Atlantic suffered 16 significant outages; the nearby New York center that handles planes flying close to the city has experienced 52 significant computer failures since 1993.

</td></tr></table>


<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
On September 26, 1996, the <a href="http://www.census.gov/">U.S. Bureau of the Census</a> announced that real median family income increased in 1995 by 1.8 percent.<sup>1</sup>  Unfortunately, many American families will find these apparent gains in income elusive. Since 1991, the growth in family income has stagnated, falling far below increases recorded during any four-year period of economic growth since 1960. In traditional married families with only the husband working, incomes have continued to decline. Only increases in the labor force participation of women, income from other sources, and the number of full-time workers also working at a second job have helped to keep the level of family income from falling across the board.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Not since World War II has the American economy come out of a recession, grown for four consecutive years, and failed to produce a significant increase in family income. No matter how one breaks down the numbers -- by region, age, marriage, or education -- the typical American family has seen real income stagnate or decline compared with the economic recoveries of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s (see <a href="fyi121c1.gif">Chart 1</a>).<sup>2</sup>  This dismal economic performance, despite lower unemployment, explains why American workers continue to believe they are working harder and harder yet failing to get ahead.
<p>
<b>Family Income Grows Slowly While Real Earnings Continue to Fall</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
By most measures -- family income, employment, wages, or economic growth -- the 1991-1995 economic recovery has been by far the slowest since the end of World War II.<sup>3</sup>  After reaching a peak of $42,049 in 1989, real median family income declined by 7.2 percent from 1989 to 1993. The initial decline can be attributed to the 1990-1991 recession, but family income continued to fall as the recovery got underway in 1992 and 1993. Despite increases in 1994 and 1995, real median family income is just 1.0 percent more than it was in 1991, and remains 3.4 percent below 1989.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Since 1993, family income has grown while real median weekly earnings for full-time workers have declined (see <a href="fyi121c2.gif">Chart 2</a>). This apparent anomaly arises because the weekly earnings of full-time workers are only one part of family income. Other sources of family income include second jobs and the earnings of spouses and children. Family income also includes interest income, dividends, and Social Security, all of which have been growing faster than wage and salary income since 1993.<sup>4</sup>  Only the increasing participation of women in the labor force and income from other sources have kept family incomes from falling overall.<sup>5</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The decline in real median weekly earnings since 1993 also raises a serious question about President Clinton's claim that most of the new jobs created since 1992 are high-paying jobs. If it is true that most of the recent employment growth has been in jobs paying above median wages, real median weekly earnings should be increasing. The data show, however, that real median weekly earnings for both men and women have declined from 1991 to 1995, suggesting that most of the job growth since 1991 has been in lower paying (below the median) jobs.

<p>
<b>Families Enjoying Growth in Real Income Vary Considerably</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Since 1991, family income has increased for some types of families while declining significantly for others, such as traditional married families with only the husband working. Baby-boomers who saw their family income rise 5.3 to 11.1 percent during the 1980s recovery are wondering why, after four years of economic growth, their family incomes actually have declined.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Growth in family income since 1991 also has varied considerably by region and by education. While family incomes rose 5.7 percent in the Midwest, they declined by 2.5 percent in the Northeast. Only families with either a doctoral degree or less than a 9th grade education have seen their family incomes rise;<sup>7</sup> everyone else's incomes have declined.
<p>
<b>Other Measures of Income Also Are Growing Slowly</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Family income is not the only measure of income that is growing either slowly or not at all. For example, from 1991 to 1995:
<p><ul>
<li> The income for all households grew in 1995 for the first time in six years, but only in the Midwest.<sup>8</sup>  In all other regions, household income continued to stagnate. Since 1991, real median household income has increased just 1.1 percent, and the income of single men and women living alone has not increased at all.
<p>
<li> Real median weekly earnings for women working full-time declined by 1.7 percent.<sup>9</sup>  For men working full-time, the decline was even worse:  3.3 percent. In addition, 4.4 million Americans are working two jobs (one full-time) just to make ends meet.<sup>10</sup>
<p>
<li> Real average annual pay has increased only 1.2 percent to $18,271.<sup>11</sup>  This is an increase of just 0.2 percent per year compared to a 1.0 percent increase per year from 1982 to 1986.<p>
<li> Real disposable income per person increased at less than half the pace of the economic expansions in the 1960s and 1980s, and 1 percent less than that of the 1974-1978 period.<sup>12</sup>
<p>
<li> Real hourly compensation increased at less than half the pace of the economic expansions in the 1970s and 1980s, and only one-fifth the rate of increase in the 1960-1964 period.<sup>13</sup>
</ul>
<p>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although the most recent data on family income seem encouraging, a more careful examination shows that the American economy continues to perform well below its potential, and many families are being left behind. For the first time in 50 years, the American economy has failed to raise family incomes significantly during four consecutive years of economic growth after a recession. Growth has been weak because of high taxes and burdensome regulations that limit productivity gains and lower the real earnings of American workers.<sup>14</sup>  Policies that focus on addressing these problems -- and especially on reducing the tax burden on Americans -- will unleash America's growth potential and allow all families, not just a select few, to enjoy higher incomes and realize their American dream.

<p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Although union members split their vote roughly 60-40 between the two major political parties in 1994, this year the <a href="http://www.aflcio.org">AFL-CIO</a> has launched an overwhelmingly partisan $35 million "voter education project," funded mainly with mandatory union dues, to defeat conservative members of the 104th Congress. What most union members may not realize is that they have every right to demand a refund of the portion of their dues used to back political candidates or lobby for causes with which they may disagree. Depending on the individual union and the accounting rules applied, union dues devoted to non-collective bargaining activities could range from under $200 to well over $1,000 a year per union member. This alone argues for a better system both to account for and to inform union members about the use of mandatory dues payments.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3580:">Worker Right to Know Act</a> (H.R. 3580), recently introduced by Representative Harris Fawell (R-IL), would require labor unions to get permission from their members before using mandatory dues for politicking and other activities unrelated to collective bargaining. Senator <a href="http://www.senate.gov/~gregg/">Judd Gregg</a> (R-NH) has introduced <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c104:H.R.3580:">a similar measure</a> (S. 1845) in the Senate. The House version of this legislation has been incorporated into the campaign finance legislation currently scheduled for House floor debate.

<p>
<b>BACKGROUND</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The National Labor Relations Act, the basic federal law governing relations between labor unions and employers, allows a union and an employer to enter into a union security agreement that requires workers, as a condition of their employment, to pay union membership dues (or an equivalent agency fee for nonmembers). Although section 14(b) of the NLRA (popularly known as the Taft-Hartley Act) allows states to enact "Right to Work" laws that prohibit such union security agreements, only 21 states have done so. In the other 29 states and the District of Columbia, a worker can be fired for refusing to pay union dues, even if such dues are used for purposes abhorrent to his or her religious, moral, or political beliefs.<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In 1988, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in <I>Communications Workers of America v. Beck</I> that workers who so choose are entitled to a refund of the portion of their dues used for purposes not related to collective bargaining activities, contract administration, and grievance processes. Writing for the majority, Justice William Brennan noted that "the National Labor Relations Act... authorizes the exaction of only those fees and dues necessary to 'performing the duties of an exclusive representative of the employees in dealing with the employer on labor-management issues.'"<sup>2</sup>  Unfortunately, this decision remains largely unenforced.

In October 1992, President George Bush issued an executive order requiring federal contractors to notify workers of their Beck rights by posting notices of these rights at worksites.<sup></sup>  One of the Clinton Administration's first actions was to rescind this order.<sup>4</sup>  Labor Secretary Robert Reich, who frequently proclaims the Clinton Administration's concern for workers' rights, told the AFL-CIO recently that "collective bargaining is not a privilege, it is a right."<sup>5</sup>  Yet the Administration has cooperated with union officials to keep workers in the dark on their Beck rights. To Reich, the Bush executive order's requirement that workers be informed of their rights is a "burden without a benefit."<sup>6</sup>

<p>
<b>National Labor Relations Board</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), an independent federal agency created by Congress in 1935 to enforce the NLRA, has failed to step in to break the conspiracy of silence on this issue. Earlier this year, in the first case concerning Beck rights heard by the Board since the Supreme Court's decision eight years ago, the NLRB found that a brief notice of Beck rights in a union's annual publication was sufficient to satisfy a worker's right to know. In a dissenting opinion, however, one NLRB member declared that this single notice did not "represent a good-faith effort" to inform non-member employees of their Beck rights.<sup>7</sup>
<p>

<b>PROBLEMS WITH EXISTING LAW</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Despite the <I>Beck</I> decision, rank-and-file union members remain largely unaware of just what their rights are. In an April 1996 survey of 1,000 union members, 78 percent did not know they had a right to obtain a refund for the portion of their mandatory dues spent on political activities. The survey further revealed that once union members realized what their Beck rights were, 56 percent would be likely to request a refund.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Even for workers who are aware of their rights, trying to exercise them can be frustrating. Currently, a union can require workers to resign from the union in order to exercise their Beck rights.<sup>9</sup>  Thus, workers who want to stop contributing to union "voter education" efforts can be left without a say in such important decisions as whether to go out on strike because their unions have forced them to resign.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Moreover, unions often serve as judge in their own case by making their own estimates of the amount of dues which should be refunded to Beck claimants. Exactly what constitutes non-collective bargaining activities is a question subject to significant disagreement. Marshall J. Breger, former Solicitor of the Department of Labor, states that as much as 80 percent of union dues is used for non-collective bargaining activities, while union attorneys claim the same 80 percent figure as the amount used for collective bargaining-related expenses.<sup>10</sup>  In a recent case, the National Education Association (NEA) and a state and local affiliate were able to prove that only 10 percent of their general treasury funds were chargeable to bargaining activities.<sup>11</sup>  Workers have a right to know where their hard-earned money is going. In 1993-1994, for instance, rank and file teacher union members in Modesto, California, paid $640 in combined local, state, and national union dues.<sup>12</sup>
<p>



<b>THE WORKER RIGHT TO KNOW ACT</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In spite of foot-dragging by labor leaders, the NLRB, and President Clinton, Congress can step in to see that hard-working Americans are made aware of their Beck rights. The Worker Right to Know Act (H.R. 3580, S. 1845) would require that a union obtain a signed agreement from an employee before using dues for purposes not related to collective bargaining activities. The agreement would offer a clear statement detailing the percentage of dues used for traditional collective bargaining and the percentage used for non-collective bargaining activities such as "voter education."<sup>13</sup>  An independent auditor would determine the percentage breakdown between mandatory and voluntary activities.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Worker Right to Know Act also would make it clear that if individual workers chose not to give a portion of their dues to the political agendas of labor leaders, they still would retain the right to participate fully in the activities of their unions.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The House version differs from the Senate version in that it would amend the NLRA and the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959 (LMRDA), while the Senate version would amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971.<sup>14</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Unions argue that this legislation is unnecessary because only a small percentage of workers have chosen to exercise their Beck rights, but that is no excuse for obstructing those who do seek to exercise their rights. Moreover, union leaders fail to mention that few union dues payers have been informed of their rights. Clearly, if knowledge of Beck rights was more widespread, more workers would seek to obtain refunds.
<p>

<b>HOW MUCH IS AT STAKE?</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Determining the overall size and composition of union budgets is difficult. Information on union membership and finances provided in annual LM-2 union disclosure forms filed with the U.S. Department of Labor is often vague and incomplete. Economist James T. Bennett of George Mason University, who has done extensive work in this area, notes that the Department of Labor neither sets guidelines for the information it requests nor performs comprehensive audits in order to verify the accuracy of the information submitted.<sup>15</sup>  Therefore, unions are fully aware that incomplete or inaccurate information will not be scrutinized. For example, the United Auto Workers (UAW) lists "not available" under rates for union dues and initiation fees on all forms currently on file at the Department of Labor (forms for 1990-1995).<sup>16</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

What can be discerned, however, is that rank-and-file union members in many cases are shouldering increasingly heavy burdens as membership declines. From 1991-1995, for example, among several of the major international unions that make up the AFL-CIO, total receipts taken in actually increased while membership continued to drop.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Trends in local union revenue likewise indicate the burden rank-and-file members are being forced to bear. A random sample of locals, when combined with the internationals, shows that receipts per member range from a low of $709.36 to a high of $2,019.35 per year.<sup>17</sup>  Given the vagaries of union practices and accounting procedures, union dues devoted to non-collective bargaining activities could range from under $200 to well over $1,000 annually per union member.

<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Labor unions will claim that the Worker Right to Know Act is merely election year harassment, but those who experience the real harassment and frustration are the workers who try to exercise their right to refuse to fund political causes with which they disagree. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

It is time to make workers aware of their rights under applicable Supreme Court decisions and to make it possible for them to exercise these rights freely. Labor unions, the National Labor Relations Board, and the Clinton Administration have kept workers uninformed of their rights. The Worker Right to Know Act would remedy this problem by giving union members the power to choose for themselves whether to give their money to political causes and by making it indisputably clear that workers can continue to participate fully in the activities of their unions even if they choose not to support the AFL-CIO's partisan political agenda.

<title> General Alexander Lebed: 
Russia's Rising Political Star - Heritage</title>

F.Y.I. No. 65<br>
September 26, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	General Alexander Ivanovich Lebed has emerged at the front of Russia's tumultuous political stage. According to the polls, he is poised to beat any other politician in the presidential elections scheduled for the summer of 1996. He is the most popular leader in Russia, ahead of President Boris Yeltsin. Yet few in the West know who he is or what he represents.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Lieutenant General Lebed retired from command of the Special 14th Army in June 1995. This Russian army still occupies the Trans-Dniester region in Moldova. Lebed today is Vice Chairman of the Congress of Russian Communities, a nationalist party headed by Soviet-era military-industrial stalwart Yurii Skokov and guided by the famous writer Alexander Solzhenitsyn. If Skokov and Lebed succeed in the Russian parliamentary elections of December 1995, their likely goals will be to restore the Russian Empire and dismantle democratic and market reforms.<sup>1</sup> A Lebed presidency might well plunge Russia into wars with her neighbors and confrontation with the United States.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Lebed has said that enlarging NATO to include some countries of Central Europe would be enough to start World War III. He is deeply suspicious of the West, particularly the United States. Lacking economic education or knowledge, he would tend to push not only for ever-increasing military budgets, but also for speedy and forced integration of the Newly Independent States of the "near abroad" into a Greater Russia. As the quintessential Soviet military man, he would see only military strength and territorial aggrandizement as the true measures of Russia's status as a great power.
<p>

<b>WHO ARE YOU, GENERAL LEBED?</b>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Lebed retired this year as a 44-year-old general of the paratroop and special assault forces. Russia's current Defense Minister, Pavel Grachev, was Lebed's long-time boss and mentor. In 1981-1982 they fought together in Afghanistan, where Grachev earned the highest Soviet military decoration, Hero of the Soviet Union.<sup>2</sup> As commander of the elite Tula paratroop division, Lebed participated in suppressing ethnic unrest during the closing days of the Soviet empire in the late 1980s. In Azerbaijan in 1988, he cracked down on riots in the capital, Baku, and commanded the   (special operations) troops sent in to quell anti-Armenian pogroms in Sumgait. He then was dispatched to put down demonstrations in the Georgian capital of Tbilisi in the spring of 1989. Over twenty people were killed and dozens wounded when his   troops used sapper shovels and chemical weapons to quash the unrest.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	In the winter of 1990, Lebed was ordered to impose martial law in Baku as communist rule in Azerbaijan was collapsing. Again, he proved himself a ruthless commander. Using armored personnel carriers, his troops shot, stabbed to death, and crushed hundreds of Azerbaijanis.<sup>3</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	In 1989-1991, younger officers of the rank of colonel and general, many of them Afghan war veterans like Lebed and Grachev, threw in with Boris Yeltsin when he made his bid for power against Mikhail Gorbachev. Most senior marshals in the General Staff supported the hard-line communist forces who staged the 1991 coup aimed at deposing Gorbachev. Today there is a public debate in Russia between Lebed and Grachev about the role each played in the momentous events of August 1991. Lebed says that as commander of the Tula Guard division, he was ordered by Grachev, then commander of the paratroop forces, to take up a position near the Russian White House. According to Lebed, he informed Yeltsin that his troops had arrived to prevent bloodshed and then reported to Grachev that he intended to protect the seat of the Russian president. While Grachev insists he supported Yeltsin all along, Lebed claims that Grachev waffled between the putschists and the president until the last minute.<sup>4</sup> In addition, Lebed reportedly got into a personal fight with then-Vice President Rutskoi.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Lebed assumed command of the 14th Army in June 1992, when ethnic Moldovans and Russians from the Trans-Dniester were at each other's throats. Three thousand people had been killed and tens of thousands wounded. Lebed stopped the war by decimating the nascent Moldovan armed forces. His nomination as commanding officer of the 14th Army put him in charge of one of the largest former Soviet arsenals, which could be used in the event of an attempt to revive the Soviet Union. Some Russian generals have explored the idea of selling arms from this depot to groups in the Balkans and the Middle East.<sup>5</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	At Kolbasna, a town near the Ukrainian border, Russian troops are still guarding the central military depot of the southwestern flank of the former Warsaw Pact. Without this protection, hundreds of tanks and cannon, millions of rounds of ammunition, and 400,000 tons of explosives could fall prey to Russian mercenaries, Serbs, Chechens, or anybody with enough cash to pay for them. Before retiring his command, Lebed suggested on several occasions that his removal from Moldova would allow "corrupt" Russian generals to sell off the gigantic 14th Army arsenal.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	In 1994 Grachev began pushing for reduction of the Russian forces in the Trans-Dniester region. He called for bringing the 14th Army and its arsenal back to Russia proper and demanded both the removal of the Army commander and a dramatic reduction in the 14th Army's manpower. In July 1994, Grachev ordered Lebed to report to Moscow, where Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin offered him the post of Defense Minister of Tajikistan, a Central Asian state in the throes of civil war. Lebed declined, asking:  "Why should a Russian general help one group of Tajiks kill another group of Tajiks?"  Yeltsin finally intervened,<sup>6</sup> and Grachev reversed his decision,<sup>7</sup> but Lebed had to fight repeated attempts by Grachev to remove him from command of the 14th Army during the following months. Lebed refused to withdraw the 14th Army and continued to sit on the largest arsenal of weapons in southeastern Europe until his resignation in June 1995.
<p>

<b>GENERAL LEBED'S VIEWS</b>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	<b>On the end of the Russian Empire.</b> Lebed has been known to bemoan the collapse of the Soviet Union, to brag about his aggressive use of military force, and to defend Russian control of the Trans-Dniestrian enclave. As commander of the 14th Army, he threatened to take the Rumanian capital of Bucharest in seven hours. He has alleged that "The West is attempting to turn Russia into a cheap supplier of raw materials, a reservoir of free labor, and a huge hazardous waste dump for the industrial world."<sup>8</sup>  Because "Everybody is wiping their feet on Russia... Russia has to show her teeth."<sup>9</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	At the same time, looking back at the collapse of the USSR, the general appears now to have reconsidered the use of force:  "I know for sure that constitutional order cannot be restored by using air force, tanks and artillery. We used military power in Tbilisi, Baku, Vilnius. Where are they today -- Georgia, Azerbaijan, Lithuania?  Everything we tried to keep by force was lost. Now everything is being done in order to lose Chechnya."<sup>10</sup>  Whether this really signals a kinder, gentler approach, however, is unknown.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<b>On Moldova.</b> Lebed claimed there were three reasons why the 14th Army should stay in Moldova:  (1) if the Army was moved, the ethnic conflict would start again; (2) both the Trans-Dniester Russians and Moldovans wanted the Russian Army to stay; and (3) moving the army with its weaponry would be dangerous. In the event of withdrawal, he warned, the arms would be seized by the Trans-Dniestrian Russians, who would sell them or use them to fight Moldovans.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	But Lebed did not enunciate the fourth -- and possibly the most weighty -- reason:  According to a leading Russian military commentator, for Russia to keep the huge arsenal in Moldova makes sense only if the former Soviet Union is put back together again. To do this would require a large army close to the Balkans and in Ukraine's rear, hundreds of miles away from the Russian border.<sup>11 </sup> Looking at the USSR's pre-1992 borders, it would make perfect sense for Lebed, a Russian "great power patriot," to keep the huge arsenal in Moldova indefinitely, until such time as the Soviet Union could be resurrected.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<b>On Democracy.</b> Lebed's democratic credentials are shaky at best. He once confessed that "To conduct diplomatic negotiations with some parliament to receive power and to maneuver is not my style."<sup>12</sup>  After he was forced to resign, he lost the aura of the persecuted general speaking for the disgruntled Russian army. Moreover, he is seen by some in the career military as having pushed the army toward a confrontation with the defense minister and the president that eroded the military's neutrality and its position "outside of politics."  Lebed is a general who used his military command to boost his political career.<sup>13</sup> By appealing to the media and civilian paramilitary forces, such as the Cossacks, Lebed played by a new set of rules that has been rejected by many officers.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<b>On Lenin.</b> Lebed is trying to define himself as a Russian patriot who appeals to both communists and nationalists. In media interviews published in 1993-1995, he attacked Russia's current leadership, charging that "Yeltsin is nothing but the first (communist party) secretary of Sverdlovsk, infamous for the destruction of the building where the last Russian tsar and his family were incarcerated before their execution."<sup>14</sup>  He also once publicly said he was reading the memoirs of White Russian generals Anton Denikin and Peter Krasnov from the Civil War era (1918-1921), a clear nod in the direction of the nationalist right wing. However, in the same interview Lebed defended keeping a large bust of Lenin in his headquarters and declared himself an atheist. "They threw the old fetishes to the junkyard, but did not give us new ones," he complained; "therefore Lenin stays."<sup>15</sup>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	The founder of the Soviet state indeed appears to have a special place in Lebed's heart:  "Lenin was the only man in our history who combined theory and practice in Russian politics."<sup>16</sup>  This despite numerous revelations in the Russian media about Lenin's personal involvement in hostage executions and the mass murder of Russian peasants, military officers, clergy, and intellectuals during and after the Civil War.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Leaders whom Lebed perceives as tough include Stalin, Charles De Gaulle, and Augusto Pinochet.<sup>17</sup> Lebed himself is often called a possible "Russian Pinochet" by the Moscow media, even though he adheres neither to the Chilean general's free-market policy nor to his anti-communism.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<b>On Crime.</b> After crushing the Moldovan attempt to take over the Trans-Dniester Republic, Lebed, who had become extremely popular locally, was elected to the Trans-Dniester Supreme Soviet (legislature). Soon he learned of the massive corruption and embezzlement for which the Trans-Dniester leadership is famous. He resigned from the local parliament, stating loudly that he would "not travel along with thieves," and called upon the state to "make everybody feel its gentle embrace."<sup>18</sup>  The army and Russian society at large took notice. Many interpreted this statement as aimed at the Yeltsin administration and Grachev's Defense Ministry, both widely regarded as corrupt.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Playing the anti-crime card in today's Russia was a winning move, especially when one military inspection after another failed to find anything wrong with the 14th Army. On the contrary, Lebed boosted morale, beefed up military drilling, created a special "Russian Soldier of the Future" program based on the Green Beret training routine, and almost eliminated the hazing and suicides which plague the rest of the Russian military.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	In a country where alcoholism is the leading cause of death and falling life expectancy, Lebed says he stopped drinking so that he "would be the only sober man in this drunken country."  For this he was widely applauded.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	Lebed has a tough fight ahead of him, perhaps the most difficult battle of his career. The prize is the Russian government. The nationalist field in Russian politics is getting crowded. "Liberal-Democratic" Party leader Vladimir Zhirinovsky, Gennady Ziuganov of the Communist Party, former Vice President Rutskoi, former Soviet Prime Minister Nikolay Ryzhkov, and others are vying for the mantle of "most patriotic" leader. Whoever emerges will have to face President Boris Yeltsin, Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin, or Yabloko leader Grigory Yavlinsky in the presidential elections of 1996.
<P>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

	If he throws his hat into the presidential ring, Lebed will have one thing working for him:  his skill in tapping two major themes in today's Russian politics -- wounded national pride and the law-and-order crusade. The Russian voters seem to be buying Lebed's simple message. It remains to be seen whether they will buy him as their next leader.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
On June 16, Russian voters across 11 time zones will vote for their next president. This will be a hard choice. The decision Russians will make is not only about the personalities of the candidates. It also is about what direction Russia will take in domestic and international policy. At stake is nothing less than whether there will be continued cooperation or renewed conflict between Russia and the West.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Boris Yeltsin, the incumbent, presided over the collapse of communism and the Soviet Union but now faces a resurgent Communist Party calling for the restoration of the Soviet Union. Yeltsin's opponent is Gennady Zyuganov, head of the Communist Party. Yeltsin was trailing Zyuganov in the polls until mid-May, but now they are running neck-and-neck, with each candidate receiving a 28-30 percent approval rating.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There are other contenders in the presidential election as well: for example, liberal economist Grigory Yavlinsky, the most pro-reform and pro-Western of all the candidates, including Yeltsin; nationalist General Alexander Lebed; neo-fascist Vladimir Zhirinovsky; and former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The free-market, democratic alternative personified by Yavlinsky remains weak. He is expected to receive only 8-10 percent of the vote. While surprises are always possible, the race appears to have come down to a choice between Boris Yeltsin and Gennady Zyuganov. Yeltsin's record has been marred by the unsuccessful war in the breakaway republic of Chechnya and the skyrocketing levels of crime and corruption, while communist turned nationalist Gennady Zyuganov has been compared to a Russian Slobodan Milosevic armed with nuclear weapons.<sup>1</sup>  With almost one-third of the voters still undecided and popular discontent with Russia's current situation so widespread, it will be difficult, though not impossible, for Yeltsin to win.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Electoral Behavior.</b> According to recent polls, over 70 percent of the Russian people blame Boris Yeltsin for their difficult economic situation; 92 percent consider their economy to be in "bad" or "critical" condition.<sup>2</sup>  In a poll taken in January 1996, 56 percent of the respondents said Yeltsin should resign immediately.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This distress is understandable. While privatization has occurred, the main beneficiaries have been the old communist elite and the criminal element. With the rule of law conspicuously absent, Russian society has fallen prey to an unprecedented wave of crime and corruption. Many in the electorate believe that the situation is Yeltsin's fault, and so are attracted to the communists. Indeed, over 50 percent of those polled indicated that they would not fear a Communist Party takeover.<sup>3</sup>  In fact, many see the communists as the only party capable of providing a social safety net and safeguards against rampant crime.<sup>4</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The elderly, who make up Russia's most active voting bloc, are staunchly pro-communist, nostalgic for a mythic Soviet past, and opposed to reforms by a margin of two to one. By contrast, young voters under 30 years old tend to be pro-reform, but their support for Yeltsin is soft, and their turnout is expected to be low.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Election Mechanics.</b> Russian law allows anyone who registers and collects one million signatures to run for president. The Central Electoral Commission (CEC), nominated jointly by both houses of the Russian parliament and the president, approves the signatures and certifies the candidates as eligible to run. In 1996, 42 candidates threw their hats in the ring, and 11 were approved by the CEC. A voter turnout below 50 percent would invalidate the election, in which case Yeltsin would remain in office and new elections would have to be scheduled within three months.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Russian elections are conducted by paper ballot: pre-printed sheets of paper on which voters check off the names of their preferred candidates. The results are aggregated by local and regional electoral commissions and then transferred electronically to a central computer run by the CEC. Reportedly, the security service in charge of electronic communications (known by the Russian acronym FAPSI) is in charge of the data processing. It is controlled by the Yeltsin administration, a fact which raises some questions concerning the reliability of the vote count.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In the runoff, scheduled for 15 days after the results of the first round are counted if no candidate wins a clear majority, the two top candidates will face each other. Presumably, they will be Boris Yeltsin and Gennady Zyuganov. Currently, Yeltsin is slowly pulling ahead of his formidable rival.
<p>

<b>BORIS YELTSIN: THE SITTING CZAR</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At 65 years of age, Boris Yeltsin has all the advantages and handicaps of incumbency. While he is blamed for falling living standards and other social ills, he is also a known quantity and a guarantor of stability. Despite his communist roots, Yeltsin has cast himself as an anti-communist during this campaign.<sup>5</suP>  Certain sectors of Russian society, especially the business elite and intellectuals, fear a communist restoration and prefer Yeltsin as the lesser of two evils. Yeltsin is particularly strong with urban, educated voters under 35 years old and with the business community.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But Yeltsin's anti-communist claims are somewhat disingenuous. The survivors in his administration are former party <I>apparatchiks</I> or communist industrial managers, including hard-line chief of staff Nikolay Yegorov, Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin, First Deputy Prime Minister Oleg Soskovets, and many others. Radical reformers have not fared nearly as well. Over the past four years, they have been forced out of the Yeltsin government, and Soviet-era <I>nomenklatura</I> now occupy most of the key posts. This phenomenon was epitomized by the nomination of the hard-line Russian Foreign Intelligence Service chief, Yevgenii Primakov, to the post of Foreign Minister in the fall of 1995. Primakov spent a lifetime in the Soviet foreign intelligence service, becoming one of Leonid Brezhnev's top Middle Eastern policymakers. He has personal ties to the Islamic fundamentalist regime in Tehran, as well as to both Iraq's Saddam Hussein and Libya's Muammar Qadhafi.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yeltsin increasingly has adopted old communist symbols as a way to take votes away from Zyuganov. For example, he gave an order to have the old red banners flown during the most recent celebration of V-E day on May 9. Moreover, surrounded by generals, he delivered a speech from the podium on top of Lenin's mausoleum and addressed the veterans as "comrades."  He has become more favorably disposed to the idea of interfering in the Russian "near abroad."  Indeed, Russian troops are stationed in Moldova, Georgia, Armenia, Belarus, and Tajikistan, and Russia is pursuing an ambitious policy of integrating the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), the loose confederation formed upon the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. This integration includes cooperation between the former KGB security services as well as among border guard troops, joint air defenses, and far-reaching economic policy coordination.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yeltsin has brought in a number of leading politicians, including some democrats, to work on his campaign. His former chief of staff, Sergei Filatov, former First Deputy Prime Minister and architect of privatization Anatoly Chubais, and Independence Television (NTV) Executive Director Victor Malashenko are among the leading Russian liberals working for him. Former acting Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar has endorsed Yeltsin, despite their bitter disagreements over the war in Chechnya.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In addition to the pitfalls faced by any incumbent, Yeltsin has made several mistakes that have come to haunt him. First, he still has not ended the fighting in Chechnya, despite the recent cease-fire which may or may not hold. Even if Chechnya remains a part of the Russian Federation, the high casualty figures (over 30,000 dead and more than 400,000 refugees) and the sheer brutality of the war will dog Yeltsin throughout the election.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yeltsin's Defense Minister, Pavel Grachev, is extremely unpopular not only inside the Russian armed forces, but with the general population as well. He is held responsible for the abysmal performance of the Russian military in Chechnya and for the widespread and growing corruption. Grachev is famous for his opulent lifestyle and goes by the nickname "Pashka the Mercedes."  Reformers want to replace Grachev with a civilian, but they have been thwarted by military leaders who resist both civilian control of the armed forces and overdue reforms of the bloated and rusty Russian war machine. Yeltsin apparently either prefers to stick with the loyal and controllable Grachev or is incapable of finding a suitable replacement.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One of Yeltsin's biggest political failures has been his refusal to create a political party of his own. The 500,000-strong communists are the leading political force in the country, beating the Yeltsin campaign in grass-roots organizing, turn-out-the-vote tactics, and pre-election meetings. Yeltsin controls the electronic media and the state budget. Everywhere he goes, he promises state subsidies for enterprises and other would-be constituencies. But most Russian voters are fed up with his promises. Lacking a political base outside of government, Yeltsin may discover -- as Central and East European reform governments already have -- that controlling the media is no guarantee of victory.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Rampant crime and corruption continue to plague Yeltsin's presidency. He could use a crime fighter in a prominent position, such as head of the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) or head of the Internal Security Services (FSB). Instead, the current Minister of the Interior, who is in charge of the police, is known more for opposing privatization and denouncing foreigners than for combating crime. General Mikhail Barsukov, Director of the FSB and Yeltsin's confidante, has lately embarked on a spy-catching mission, hurting Russia's relations with the West in the process. His latest "success" was uncovering an alleged British spy ring. Yet the arrest may have been little more than a cover-up for Russian organized crime outfits supplying the Irish Republican Army (IRA) with weapons, and possibly with nuclear materials.<sup>7</sup>  Yeltsin's lack of leadership in the war on crime has been a great handicap, raising serious questions about the extent of corruption in his administration.

<p>
<b>GENNADY ZYUGANOV: THE COMMUNIST CHALLENGER</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yeltsin's main challenger is Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov.<sup>8</sup>  The 52-year-old Zyuganov is a quintessential Communist Party <I>apparatchik</I> who rose steadily through the ranks of the Soviet power structure, only to have it destroyed by Gorbachev's <I>glasnost</I> and <I>perestroika</I>.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov believes in the imminent collapse of Western civilization. He refers to the West as "ultra-materialist, selfish and spiritless" and regards the reforms of the 1980s as the greatest treason executed against Russia by Western intelligence agencies and their agents in Russia (the reformers). He also has condemned both former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin as traitors.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov deeply distrusts the West and is preoccupied with restoring Russia's "old glory."  He articulates the frustration of those who see Russia as a wounded superpower betrayed by its leadership and relegated by scheming adversaries to the sidelines of history. Parallels between pre-Hitler Germany, which had just lost World War I, and Russia, which was defeated in the Cold War, are too obvious to be ignored.<sup>9</sup>  Russian communists and nationalists, like the German Nazis before them, are appealing to the sort of militant and xenophobic nationalism that leads inevitably to disastrous military adventures.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov has revised communist ideology, making it more nationalistic and imperialistic than in the Soviet era. He offers an ideology to fill the spiritual void left by the collapse of the USSR -- something Yeltsin has failed to do.<sup>10</sup>  But Zyuganov's message is poisonous. He speaks and writes about a Western conspiracy, led by the U.S. and aimed at destroying first the Soviet Union and then Russia. As Zyuganov tells it, Gorbachev and Yeltsin are traitors, and the U.S. is the embodiment of all that is evil in the world; corrupt and materialistic, the U.S. and the West are doomed. At the same time, however, Zyuganov and his aides talk about the need for trade and investment with the West, and Zyuganov touts himself as a pragmatic, even pro-business Russian leader when speaking to Westerners. Like Lenin, Stalin, and Brezhnev before him, Zyuganov talks the tough anti-Western line at home but tries to portray himself as an innocuous reformer interested in Western investment when talking to Western audiences.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Flirting with God.</b> In their attempt to build a broad nationalist-communist coalition, the "new" communists have even dropped the traditional atheism from their party's platform. Today, an open believer can be a member of the party, but only if he is a member of "the three Russian traditional denominations" -- Orthodoxy, Islam, or Buddhism. This newly professed religious tolerance does not apply to Protestants, Catholics, or Jews, however, despite their deep roots in Russia. According to the communist-sponsored draft law on religion (vetoed previously by President Yeltsin), these minority denominations would become subject to severe regulation by the state. Unchecked, the communists conceivably could move to ban Western-based Protestant denominations outright. In order to steal religion's thunder, Zyuganov has announced that the socialist ideas he espouses are grounded in the 2,000-year-old Christian tradition and have deep roots in the Russian Orthodox Church.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While not personally charismatic, Zyuganov is a master tactician whose organizational skills have won grudging praise from his opponents. He organized the resurgence of the Communist Party after the blow it suffered in the 1991 coup. He won in court against proceedings initiated by the Yeltsin administration to ban the party in 1993 and then led the party to electoral victory in the Duma elections of December 1995. Zyuganov also is credited with building a broad coalition with the nationalists for the 1996 presidential elections.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The Communist Party has the strongest organization in Russia. No one, including President Yeltsin, can match its network of political hacks, propagandists, union organizers, and influence peddlers. The party enjoys unparalleled popularity in the cash-starved military, obsolete heavy industry, and inefficient agricultural sectors and has largely restored its network of grass-roots cells in factories, schools, universities, and government offices. As in Soviet times, membership is by co-optation only, and three recommendations from party members in good standing are needed in order to join. Thus, the party is not a mass political movement in the Western sense.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zyuganov is considered a moderate by Communist Party standards, and there are many, both within and outside the party, who are more hard-line than he. Some of these allies, such as Viktor Anpilov, head of the Marxist-Leninist "Labor Russia" movement, support Zyuganov only on condition that he drop any kind of social democratic rhetoric. Anpilov believes in shooting and jailing political opponents and is vitriolic in his denunciations of the West. In the future, Zyuganov may be challenged and replaced by a more orthodox communist; he also could be challenged successfully by such other contenders as Valentian Kuptsov, former chairman and current number two figure in the party, or Duma Chairman Gennady Seleznev.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
While Yeltsin and Zyuganov most probably will remain the two front-runners for the presidency, three other candidates could break into the second round of elections. If Yeltsin stumbles -- for example, if he is incapacitated or there is a major terrorist event, possibly triggered by the war in Chechnya -- one of the following candidates could appeal to Russian voters and cut Yeltsin out of the runoff elections.

<P>
<b>GRIGORY YAVLINSKY: THE REFORMERS' BEST HOPE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 Grigory Yavlinsky, the leader of "Yabloko," a reformist party with social democratic leanings and the only free-market party left in the Duma, is projected to receive about 10 percent of the popular vote in the first round of the upcoming elections. His supporters are those who did not gain property or power in the economic reform but still have anti-communist, pro-free market, and democratic convictions. His core support is in large cities, such as Moscow and St. Petersburg, among students, the intelligentsia, and some entrepreneurs. Yavlinsky rose to prominence by attacking former Prime Minister Yegor Gaidar and President Yeltsin for mistakes committed during the implementation of economic reforms, although today he admits that Gaidar's reforms were "mostly correct."<sup>11</sup>  He is the author of the reformist 500-day program, which was rejected by former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev in 1990 and never implemented.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Born in Lviv, Ukraine, and 44 years old, Yavlinsky is the most Westernized of all the presidential candidates. He speaks English well and has a long-standing academic relationship with Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government. Western free-market economists sometimes consider his policies too Keynesian and inflationary, and many of the policies he advocates, such as raising pensions and salaries in the state sector, could lead to increased public spending and inflation if implemented.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yavlinsky strongly opposes the war in Chechnya, and his criticism of Yeltsin's policies in Chechnya have split traditional democratic reformers. Those who support the war, such as former Finance Minister Boris Fedorov, also support Boris Yeltsin; those who oppose the war -- for example, Andrey Sakharov's widow Elena Bonner and Yeltsin's former Human Rights Commissioner, Sergei A. Kovalev -- support Yavlinsky. Yavlinsky criticizes the Yeltsin administration for violating human rights (especially in the Chechen conflict), allowing corruption to spread, and neglecting the rule of law. He also favors full economic integration of the Commonwealth of Independent States under the aegis of Russia. Such a merger would include a common market of goods, services, and labor, and possibly a single currency. At the same time, however, Yavlinsky recognizes the need for these countries to preserve their independence.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yavlinsky lacks a strong party machine, is a poor campaigner, and has largely run out of funds. In addition, many in the democratic camp have not forgiven his vitriolic attacks on former Yeltsin Prime Minister and democrat Yegor Gaidar. Today, it does not appear that Yavlinsky can beat either Yeltsin or Zyuganov in the first round of elections; therefore, he is unlikely to be a strong challenger in the second round.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yeltsin and Yavlinsky have conducted negotiations that could lead to Yavlinsky's withdrawing his candidacy in favor of Yeltsin, but these talks so far have been inconclusive. Yeltsin, hoping to receive several million of Yavlinsky's votes, has stated that, if re-elected, he would offer Yavlinsky the post of First Deputy Prime Minister in charge of economic reform.<sup>12</sup>  This post, formerly occupied by the dynamic Anatoly Chubais, is occupied currently by industrialist Vladimir Kadannikov, who lacks strong credentials as a reformer. Yavlinsky is holding out, hoping for a strong showing in the first round of the elections, and possibly that he will be offered the post of Prime Minister if Yeltsin's position seems desperate enough. As his price for supporting Yeltsin for president, Yavlinsky also is demanding an end to the war in Chechnya and the firing of some the hard-liners in the current administration.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yavlinsky could win in his campaign dealings with Yeltsin, or he could destroy his political future and reputation. If his demands are accepted, and if he can secure some guarantees that Yeltsin will not fire him, he could jump-start the economic reforms, end the war in Chechnya, and become the recognized leader of the democratic camp, greatly enhancing his chances of becoming the next president of Russia. He also could be pushed aside by Yeltsin after the election, meeting the same fate as Gaidar and Chubais. In short, lacking a strong political party machine, financial support, and executive experience, Yavlinsky could join the Yeltsin administration without enough power to accomplish anything, condemning himself to a swift political demise.
<p>

<b>VLADIMIR ZHIRINOVSKY: THE WILD CARD</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Vladimir Volfovich Zhirinovsky became an internationally recognized figure when his organization, the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), gained almost 25 percent of Russia's electoral vote in the State Duma elections on December 12, 1993. His main slogans in the 1993 campaign were "I will not allow anybody to abuse Russians" and "I will make Russia rise from its knees."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zhirinovsky was a military intelligence officer before becoming a lawyer. He later worked for a KGB-run organization which established and maintained contact with foreign students. Allegations by Mikhail Gorbachev and Alexander Yakovlev, as well as these early intelligence connections and mysterious cash inflows early in his party's activities, indicate that the Russian security services launched his political career. In the December 1995 Duma elections, Zhirinovsky garnered over 10 percent of the vote, well ahead of predictions. He is projected to receive about the same percentage, or somewhat less, in the June presidential elections.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Today, he is running the most low-profile campaign in his political history, freely proclaiming that Yeltsin is going to be re-elected. This is most uncharacteristic behavior for the ambitious Zhirinovsky, who normally would conduct the most aggressive campaign, heavily emphasizing media coverage and mass rallies. Many observers speculate that his passivity indicates that the Russian security services may still control Zhirinovsky, and that Yeltsin's entourage has been able to neutralize him as a threat. Moscow-based observers believe that Zhirinovsky either was bought off or was blackmailed into silence. Meanwhile, Zhirinovsky states publicly that he is focusing his political effort on the year 2000, building his party and leaving someone else to take responsibility for the disastrous situation of the Russian state.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The name of Zhirinovsky's party is dangerously misleading. Many Westerners probably assume the Liberal Democrats really are liberal and democratic. In fact, however, they are neither; if anything, they are national socialists. Launched in the latter years of the Soviet Union with the encouragement and participation of top Communist Party and KGB officials, the LDPR is an ultra-nationalist party that stands for Russian imperial revival. While declaring limited support for markets and private property, Zhirinovsky favors a large government sector in the economy and a strong military-industrial complex. His statements on the restoration of the Russian Empire, including Alaska, Poland, and Finland, are particularly troublesome. In his book <I>The Last Thrust South</I>, he said that he will not rest until Russian soldiers wash their boots in the Indian Ocean. His foreign political allies include Jean Marie Le Pen's French National Front, the German and Austrian Neo-Nazis, and Saddam Hussein's Ba'ath party.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Publicly audacious, Zhirinovsky has become one of the most successful post-communist politicians. The LDPR today is the second-largest political party in Russia, second only to the communists. With many regional and local organizations and several party newspapers, its organization is larger than anything the reformers, or even President Yeltsin himself, can claim. A gifted speaker with a sense of humor and a penchant for one-liners, Zhirinovsky is probably Russia's best political campaigner. He performs well on television and is entertaining when interviewed. He also has gained popularity with many young voters through his intensive use of pop and rock music and his regular and open discussion of sex. He shamelessly promotes himself through brand names, such as Zhirinovsky vodka and clothing, and owns a Zhirinovsky store in Moscow which sells Zhirinovsky T-shirts, rock and punk music, and even Zhirinovsky matchboxes.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Zhirinovsky's past election successes have sent chills through Russians, Eastern Europeans, and citizens of the former Soviet republics. He stands for the restoration of the Russian Empire as a unitary state, and for an aggressive foreign policy in Central Europe and the Middle East. He would accomplish this through military power, which could lead to a major clash with the West. Any sign of his advance to the pinnacle of power in Russia would be tantamount to a political earthquake.
<p>
<b>GENERAL ALEXANDER LEBED: NO COLIN POWELL</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
General Alexander Ivanovich Lebed emerged at the front of Russia's political stage in 1994-1995, when he served as commander of the 14th Army Russian troops occupying part of Moldova. For a while, he was the most popular politician in Russia. Currently, he is polling at about 5 percent.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Lebed was the classmate of current Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, who was also Lebed's commander and mentor in the paratrooper academy in the city of Ryazan. Initially, his career was attached to Grachev's; they both fought, for example, in Afghanistan. As the USSR was collapsing, Lebed was involved in "peacemaking" operations, suppressing popular rebellions in Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Lithuania.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Lebed positioned himself as a tough crime fighter, the outsider who feels the pain of ordinary people and of the military rank and file. He fought the appointment of the notoriously corrupt General Matvey Burlakov as first deputy defense minister in the fall of 1994, with the result that Burlakov was fired. To protest corruption in the Trans-Dniester region, he resigned from the parliament of this ethnically Slavic enclave. While the Soviet and Russian military was collapsing, Lebed managed to build and train a surprisingly fit military force.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Lebed retired from command of the 14th Army in June of 1995, losing the aura of the persecuted hero speaking for the disgruntled Russian army. He is seen by some in the career military as having pushed the army toward confrontation with the defense minister and the president, eroding the military's neutrality and its position "outside of politics."  Lebed also is faulted by some for using his command to boost his political image.<sup>13</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Lebed's political career has turned out to be less spectacular than his military adventures. He is not only blunt, but abrasive. He has stated publicly that "to conduct diplomatic negotiations with some parliament to receive power" and "maneuver" is not his style.<sup>14</sup>  "For idiots who did not get it the first time," he once told a press conference, "I repeat, I do not comment on Chechnya."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
During the December 1995 Duma elections, Lebed was vice chairman of the nationalist Union of Russian Communities, headed by Soviet-era industrial stalwart Yurii Skokov. The general and his party did poorly in these elections, primarily because of Skokov's mismanagement of the campaign. The Union failed to garner enough votes to be represented in the Duma, damaging Lebed's stature as a challenger for the presidency in the upcoming elections of 1996.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If he ever did become president or even defense minister, Lebed might push Russia toward confrontation with her neighbors and the West. He has said repeatedly that enlarging NATO to include Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia would be a <I>casus belli</I> for World War III. "The West is wiping its feet all over Russia," he has said. He is deeply suspicious of the West, and particularly of the U.S., and as the quintessential Soviet military man sees Russia expressing herself as a Great Power only through military strength and territorial aggrandizement. Still, he seems to have mellowed, tends to identify himself as an anti-communist and anti-establishment, and has received a crash course in market economics from the Moscow liberal economists.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Despite his appeal, the majority of the Russian public believes that an active-duty or even a former military man should not be president. Lebed's chances today do not seem particularly high, though he could siphon off some of Zyuganov's and Yeltsin's support.


<P>
<b>"THIRD TIER" CANDIDATES</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
All of the following candidates are registered to run in the elections, although none appears to have a good chance of achieving a strong showing in the first round.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Aman Geldy Tuleev.</b> This hard-line communist leader was born in Krasnovodsk, Turkmenistan, in 1944. A graduate of the Novosibirsk Railroad Engineering Institute, he served from March 1990 to October 1993 as speaker of the Kemerovo Region Soviet. In 1991, Tuleyev ran for president of Russia, finishing fifth. Since April 1994, he has served as speaker of the Legislative Assembly of the Kemerovo Region. Tuleyev is a member of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation. For reasons probably better known to party insiders, he has promised to withdraw his candidacy and endorse Gennady Zyuganov but has not yet pulled out of the race. Tuleev is close to Zyuganov politically and is seen as a reserve player for the communists.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Martin Shakkum.</b> A dark horse candidate with ties to the powerful Russian military industry, Martin Shakkum was born in the Moscow region in 1951. He graduated from a military engineering academy, earned a degree in civil engineering by correspondence, and holds a Ph.D. in political science. He worked for the Institute of Space Research from 1976 to 1978, after which he held a sequence of managerial positions in construction (in the Mosinzhremont and Glavmosoblstroy state-run companies). In 1990, Shakkum became CEO of the RIDA joint enterprise. He currently is first vice president of the International Fund of Economic and Social Reforms (the Reform Fund), which started out as moderately reformist but now takes increasingly hard-line positions. In 1992-1993, Shakkum served as a consultant to former Vice Premier Georgy Khizha, who was in charge of the military-industrial complex in the Yeltsin cabinet and known as a hard-liner. Since April 1996, Shakkum has led the Russian Socialist Popular Party. He is a nationalist and anti-Western politician.

<b>Vladimir Bryntsalov.</b> This colorful candidate represents the nascent Russian business class. Bryntsalov was born in 1946 in the city of Cherkessk in Stavropol province. After graduating from the Novocherkassk Polytechnic Institute in 1969, he taught at the Cherkassk Polytechnic College and then worked in construction. In 1987, he started an agricultural cooperative. Toward the end of the 1980s, Bryntsalov became head of the Moscow Drug Manufacturers' Association, which later became Ferane, a major joint-stock enterprise. A multimillionaire, Bryntsalov is a Duma member (elected in December 1995) and both founder and leader (since April 1996) of the Russian Socialist Party. Bryntsalov espouses a combination of nationalist and socialist views.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Yuri Vlasov.</b> This nationalist candidate was born in 1935. He was the superheavyweight world champion in weight-lifting in 1959, 1961, 1962, and 1963, and Olympic superheavyweight champion in 1960. Vlasov set many weight-lifting records and was nicknamed "the strongest man on Earth."  He also was the young Arnold Schwarzenegger's role model. A 1959 graduate of the Zhukovsky Air-Force Engineering Academy, he later became a writer.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yuri Vlasov presents himself as a "patriot" fighting communism and the Zionist conspiracy against the Russian people. He participated in the December 1995 parliamentary elections on the list of the leftist Power to the People but failed to gain a seat in the Duma, losing to Konstantin N. Borovoi, a prominent businessman and leader of the right-of-center Party of Economic Freedom, in Tushino.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Svyatoslav Fyodorov.</b> Fyodorov is a successful and prosperous eye surgeon who recently has gone into politics, polling at only about 6 percent in the current presidential race. He was something of a national hero even under Brezhnev. In 1995, he formed his centrist Workers' Self-Government Party. He advocates the mass creation of joint stock companies to guarantee workers a share of profits, the removal of most taxes, and a ban on the export of most raw materials. He presents himself as a third force in Russian politics, claiming that he draws his inspiration from former U.S. presidential candidate Ross Perot and China's paramount leader Deng Xiaoping.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
<b>Mikhail Gorbachev.</b> The former Soviet leader is still popular in the West for his role in ending the Cold War and bringing about the end of the Communist Party's monopoly on power. But his popularity at home is close to zero, and no major political force has ventured to back him. Only some aging Moscow intellectuals sing his praises, and even the news-hungry Russian media are ignoring the man who helped bring down the Soviet empire. His chances in the elections are close to zero.
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The fact that the presidential elections are taking place at all indicates how far Russia has progressed on the road to freedom. But the fact that there is no viable democratic, pro-free market front-runner demonstrates how long it will be before Russia achieves genuine democracy.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Russian democrats, with the exception of the left-of-center Grigory Yavlinsky and his Yabloko, erred in failing to create a viable political party. This failure has contributed significantly to their loss of voter appeal.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Unfortunately, the June elections present the Russian voters with a rather unhappy choice. If they vote for Yeltsin, they will be choosing haphazard reforms accompanied by lawlessness and corruption. If the communists win, the majority of Russian voters may be choosing a massive renationalization of property and an attempt to restore the Russian empire.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A communist victory in Russia this summer would be a major setback for democracy, although it would not necessarily be a vote of no confidence against free markets and democracy. The Yeltsin administration's implementation of reform has been extremely inept, mired in a degree of corruption unprecedented even by Russian standards. Instead of attaining a market economy, the Russian voters have been confronted largely by a caricature, in many cases presided over by the same old Soviet <I>nomenklatura</I> clad in new suits and driving new cars.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A communist ascendancy most probably would result not in a new totalitarianism, but in severe crisis and the final disillusionment of the Russian people with the communist idea.<sup>15</sup>  Despite difficulties and setbacks, the ideas behind free markets and political democracy are developing roots in Russia, especially among the young generation. Neither the old nor the "new" communist and nationalist ideologies appears to have the power to mobilize the people and resources of today's Russia to create a second version of the Soviet Brave New World.

<html><head><title>Linda Chavez</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><center><h3>Linda Chavez</h3></center><hr>

<i>The New York Times</i> calls Linda Chavez "an influential voice on civil rights policy." <i>The Washington Post</I> describes her as one of "a new generation of intellectuals [seeking] to question the orthodoxies of the civil rights establishment" 
 <P>
Chavez is President of the Center for Equal Opportunity, based in Washington. She is the author of <I>Out of 
the Barrio: Toward a New Politics of Hispanic Assimilation</i> (Basic Books, 1991) which chronicles the 
untold story of Hispanic progress and achievement and addresses the implications of bilingual education, voting rights, immigration, and Affirmative action. The Denver Post said that this book "should explode the stereotypes about Hispanics that have clouded the minds of patronizing liberals and xenophobic conservatives alike." 
 <P>
Many know Chavez from her weekly column in <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/">USA Today</a>, which appears each Wednesday. She writes often for many other publications, including the <a href="http://www.wsj.com/">Wall Street Journal</a>, the <i>Washington Post</i>, <i>The New Republic, Commentary</i>, and <i>Crisis</i>. She also makes regular appearances on "The McLaughlin Group," "To the Contrary," "CNN & Co.," "Equal Time " and "The McNeil-Lehrer News Hour." 
 <P>
Chavez has held a number of political positions, among them <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov">White House</a> Director of Public Liaison (1985) and Director of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights (1983-85). She won the Republican nomination for U.S. Senator from Maryland (1986), but lost in the general election. Before that, Chavez 
was editor of the prizewinning quarterly journal of the American Federation of Teachers, <i>American Educator</I> (1977-83). She also serves as U.S. Expert on the United Nations Subcommission on Human 
Rights. 
 <P>
Chavez is currently at work on her second book, <i>A House Divided: Race and the Politics of Multiculturalism</I>.

<P>

<hr>
<P>
 Last April, after you finished doing your income taxes and sent
them off to the IRS, you may have needed a break.  So you may
have gathered up your family to go out to your favorite restaurant
for dinner.  What you probably didn't realize was how much you
were <a href="/atr/tax-presentation/mealoped.html">paying in taxes again</a> at the restaurant.
<P>
 In most places, you of course must pay sales tax on your bill.
 Many jurisdictions impose special, higher sales taxes on drinks
or food sold at restaurants.  So the sales tax can be as high
as 10% of your bill.
<P>
 But that is only the beginning.  Out of the amount the consumer
pays to the restaurant, the restaurant must pay Federal income
taxes, state income taxes, Federal payroll taxes, sales taxes,
capital gains taxes, unemployment insurance taxes, workmen's compensation
taxes, business license taxes and fees, utility taxes, local property
taxes, and any local income taxes.  The restaurant also must pay
Federal and state excise taxes on its telephones.
<P>
 Altogether, these taxes average 17.6% of a typical restaurant
bill.  Counting the sales taxes paid directly by the consumer,
this means about one-fourth, or as much as 27.6%, of what you
pay for a meal at a restaurant ends up going to the government
in taxes rather than to the restaurant.
<P>
 So if the bill for dinner for your family comes to $40, about
$10-$11 ends up going to the government in taxes.  The cost of
everything else going into your meal, including the food, its
delivery, its preparation, salaries for the restaurant employees,
and other restaurant overhead, is covered by the remaining $29-$30.
<P>
 These taxes are unfair to workers.  In a democracy, taxes should
not be hidden in the prices of products people buy.  They should
be explicit and clear, so that voters can determine whether they
think those taxes are worth what they are getting from their government.
<P>
 Thomas Jefferson wrote, &quot;Government should not take out
of the mouth of labor the bread that it has earned.&quot;  But
that is exactly what our greedy and overreaching government does
today.  It taxes you on your income when you earn it, and taxes
it again when you spend it, and taxes you over and over again
along the way.  As a result, the average family today actually
pays more in taxes than on food, clothing, and shelter combined.
<P>
 Tax relief for working people is long overdue.  Such tax reduction
would give workers more control over their own incomes and economic
future.  A major tax reduction would also greatly stimulate the
economy, leading to more jobs, higher wages, and expanded economic
opportunity and prosperity.

<i><font size="-1">Town Hall is the first truly
interactive community
on the Internet to bring Internet users and public policy organizations together under the broad 
umbrella of "conservative" thoughts, ideas and 
actions.  Our goal is to become the mall of ideas in which people congregate
to exchange, discuss and disseminate the latest news and information.  Town Hall is 
committed to inform, educate and entertain the public through this emerging electronic medium.
<P>
The organizations that have chosen to become citizens of Town Hall do not agree on 
every issue, yet that is why Town Hall believes our community is of value.  An 
interactive, open and honest debate of the issues within the conservative community 
will help us all in the fight against those who would sacrifice the individual and freedom
 for 
political gain and big government.
</font></i><P>

INSIDE REPORT<br>
GOP: NOT COLORBLIND
</h2>
<h3>
Robert D. Novak
</h3>
<i>July 15, 1996</i>

</center>

<dd>SACRAMENTO, Calif. -- It is not just presidential candidate Robert J. 
Dole who has backed away from the drive to end racial preferences in 
California. So has the national Republican establishment.
<P>
<dd>House Speaker Newt Gingrich has publicly recommended that Dole not 
actively campaign for the California Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI) to bar 
government affirmative action programs that practice racial 
discrimination. Republican National Chairman Haley Barbour has been 
lukewarm. Jack Kemp has all but opposed the initiative. 
<P>
<dd>So have leaders of giant California-based corporations, whose 
pocketbooks are open to Dole but not CCRI. Fund-raising efforts beyond 
the state's borders have flopped, with normally conservative money 
sources in New York saying no. 
<P>
<dd>In contrast, actively and financially aligned in opposition to the initiative 
are the education establishment, organized labor, the Democratic Party, 
minority-group activists and assorted foundations. "Everyone is against 
us," Ward Connerly, a University of California regent and CCRI state 
chairman, told me. "Everybody but the people." 
<P>
<dd>That is an exaggeration. California Republicans such as State GOP 
Chairman John Herrington, Assembly Speaker Curt Pringle and 
especially Gov. Pete Wilson are solidly supportive. But the real push for 
a colorblind system does come from the public, holding steady at 65 
percent in some polls.
<P>
<dd>Given that popularity, why would Dole back away from CCRI? Arnie 
Steinberg, the veteran political operative managing the proposal, blames 
"country-club Republicans." 
<P>
<dd>One of California's leading corporate executives, a conservative 
Republican, cannot speak on the record because his company has not 
decided whether to oppose CCRI. But he defined his personal views: "If 
we do away with affirmative action, what happens to these young people? 
I worry about the third big riot in Los Angeles."
<P>
<dd>Similar concern was expressed by George Deukmejian, former two-term 
Republican governor of California, when he declined to support the 
initiative and then told of his epiphany. Since he now has to drive his 
own car through the racially diverse streets of Los Angeles, he perceives 
a dangerously "fragile" city.
<P>
<dd>Such talk infuriates Sacramento management consultant Connerly, an 
African-American who contends that big businessmen are seeking 
government protection for their own racial preference policies. He points 
to last month's Los Angeles Times poll of the city's voters showing 69 
percent support for CCRI, including 56 percent from blacks and 68 
percent from Hispanics. He considers absurd the danger of underclass 
blacks rioting because they want to go to Berkeley and demeaning the 
notion that African-Americans can get there only with special 
preferences. 
<P>
<dd>Connerly, who became a Republican in the late 1960s when he observed 
then Gov. Ronald Reagan upholding the rights of the individual, mourns 
the lost political opportunity. A Dole delegate to the GOP national 
convention, Connerly wants his candidate to use this popular issue to 
erase the California gap between him and Bill Clinton. One of the 
president's managers here says privately that while he must oppose CCRI, 
the less Clinton says about it, the better.
<P>
<dd>But it was Dole on his last California visit who ignored CCRI, and 
Connerly privately took issue with him. The response came from Dole's 
wife, Elizabeth, who asked what the initiative would do to "outreach" 
programs. Nothing, Connerly replied, so long as there are no racial 
preferences. But, she persisted, what about "compensatory outreach," 
such as she practiced as secretary of labor?  That suggested the thinking 
of the Doles was frozen in outmoded cliches.
<P>
<dd>Dole's agents ambiguously assure CCRI that he will be aboard the effort. 
When Wilson telephoned Gingrich to protest his contrary advice to Dole, 
the speaker told the governor he would help raise funds for the initiative. 
But skepticism abounds about promises from Washington. "I have never 
in my life been lied to so much and double-crossed so often," Steinberg 
told me.
<P>
<dd>Connerly describes CCRI this way: "This is a defining issue between 
Dole and Clinton. It is the right thing to do, good for the country, good 
for the party. If an incompetent Republican Party cannot understand this, 
it deserves its fate." He is implying that whether Dole ends his retreat on 
a colorblind society may determine not only whether he carries California 
but whether he deserves to.

Snow: MR. WILLPOWER - July 15, 1996

<h2>MR. WILLPOWER</h2>
<h3>Tony Snow</h3>
<i>July 15, 1996</i>
</center>
<p>
<dd>WASHINGTON -- It's as close as you get to a right-wing intellectual 
salon in Washington: Each Wednesday morning, a group of conservative 
political operatives gathers at the offices of Americans for Tax Reform 
and talks about how to create a limited-government movement as durable 
and inspiring as FDR's New Deal bureaucracy. 
<p>
<dd>Until recently, these cabals had a festive air about them. The attendees -- 
mostly guys -- predicted great things and called key politicians by their 
first names, as in: "Newt says ..." 
<p>
<dd>Then came Bob Dole, who in 100 days has done more to dampen 
regulars' spirits than Bill Clinton possibly could do in 1000. One stalwart 
confessed after last week's confab: "People are getting worried. It's white-
knuckle time now." 
<p>
<dd>Republicans have plenty of reasons to feel helpless. If there is one 
defining characteristic of Bob Dole, it's that he does things his way. Jim 
Lucier, a grandee at Americans for Tax Reform, notes that "Bob Dole is 
Mr. Willpower. He willed himself out of a hospital bed as a young man, 
and within two years won his first public office. He says, 'I know what I 
want, and that's the way it's going to be.' That's his secret. If he didn't 
have that ornery streak, he'd probably still be in a hospital bed." 
<p>
<dd>Yet that stubbornness has become a liability -- at least in the short run -- 
because candidate Dole possess two other, usually fatal traits. He has no 
discernible ideology, and he has no bosom buddies besides his wife. 
<p>
<dd>William F. Buckley tried to define the ideological problem in a recent 
interview with Sir David Frost. He described the difference between a 
lawmaker like Dole and a leader like Ronald Reagan as that between 
being "a conservative" and being "conservative." 
<p>
<dd>"A conservative," in the Buckley argot, enters public life to defend and 
extend a set of exalted values. Such a person trades in grand visions -- 
shining cities on the hill, for instance -- and invites voters to build a 
world defined by their dreams and aspirations. He gives everyone a stake 
in his success, and when he wins, so do his supporters. 
<p>
<dd>Dole, in contrast, approaches politics as a profession with set procedures 
and rituals. The good organization man wears the right clothes, adopts the 
proper opinions, follows the rules and attends no function that people 
have not paid to attend. This power-by-numbers approach works just 
dandy in the prim, hierarchical GOP. Today, after 36 years in 
Washington, all Dole's superiors have moved on or died -- and he stands 
atop the heap. Alone.
<p>
<dd>This triumph carries a special set of problems. Dole doesn't superintend a 
throng of admirers. He bestrides a tank packed with predatory would-be 
successors. Nobody cheers when he wins. Colleagues plot his removal. It 
is as if he has written a will, and everyone is lingering around, waiting for 
him to give them an opportunity to divide up the estate. 
<p>
<dd>This explains why a Dole event has all the electricity of a compulsory 
elementary-school lecture on the dangers of head lice. People appear out 
of duty, not passion. Even the candidate looks bored, as if someone 
dragged him into the hall. 
<p>
<dd>In an age when people venerate politicians with big hearts and profound 
senses of empathy, Dole keeps folks at bay with witty barbs and 
stultifying shows of jargon. When someone asked him about his position 
on welfare reform, he offered the timeless quip, "I'm in the conference 
(committee)." 
<p>
<dd>Hence, "white-knuckle time." Even though Republicans haven't held their 
nominating convention, many party elders have come to the conclusion 
that their man will lose unless Bill Clinton somehow winds up in the 
clink. They know Dole is Dole, and heartbreakingly, nobody will stand 
up for him unless first getting paid. 
<p>
<dd>If you don't believe it, think back to last week's hot controversy. Dole 
skipped the convention of the National Association for the Advancement 
of Colored People. When the press began blasting him, only Sen. John 
McCain rose in his defense -- and McCain originally supported Phil 
Gramm. 
<p>
<dd>So we have the following weird situation. Dole stands alone and stands 
for nothing, yet Republicans know they owe their power to ideas. Let's 
face it, Gingrich and Co. are not just a bunch of pretty faces.  
<p>
<dd>As a result, members of his own party have begun planning an 
ideological takeover. If, within the next fortnight, he doesn't speak about 
key issues -- especially taxes, crime and quotas -- they will. And Bob 
Dole, Mr. Willpower, will be cast as a guy Americans should vote for not 
because he dares to lead, but because he will not get in the Republican 
Congress' way.

Sowell: THE GAY "MARRIAGE" ISSUE - July 18, 1996

<h2>
THE GAY "MARRIAGE" ISSUE
</h2>
<h3>Thomas Sowell</h3>
<i>July 18, 1996</i>
</center>
<p>
<dd>On an issue where misleading and dishonest statements have been the 
norm, it should hardly be surprising that the headline on the San 
Francisco Chronicle read: "House Votes Against Gay Marriages." The 
story claimed that the bill passed by the House was "a bill to restrict gay 
marriage."
<p>
<dd>In reality, after this vote you can still have all the gay marriages you want 
and any state that wants to recognize these marriages remains free to do 
so. What Congress refused to do was to force all 50 states to accord 
same-sex relationships the whole sweeping range of legislation that has 
been passed over the centuries, based on the assumption that this 
legislation would apply to a union between a man and a woman, who 
have the prospect of producing children that would have to be taken care 
of by them or by the society. 
<p>
<dd>Any state that wants to apply any or all of this legislation to homosexual 
unions remains free to do so after the House vote. What the gay activists 
and their allies in the liberal media wanted was for all states to be forced 
to do so, if any single state decided to recognize homosexual unions as 
marriages, superseding the previously defined sense of the term.
<p>
<dd>In other words, what they wanted was an end-run around the democratic 
process, so that they could piggy-back onto legislation passed with 
entirely different situations in mind. 
<p>
<dd>This is what the House of Representatives rejected -- and rightly so. If 
homosexuals want to participate in the democratic process and convince 
state legislatures to apply some or all of the laws that were passed for 
husband-wife unions and their offspring to same-sex relationships as 
well, they have every right to do so. 
<p>
<dd>They do not have a right to sneak in through the back door, pretending to 
be somebody else, just by using a word. 
<p>
<dd>The issue of gay marriages exposes the hypocrisy of what was once the 
homosexuals' strongest argument -- that what consenting adults do in 
private is nobody else's business. Now it is suddenly everybody else's 
business to recognize these liaisons and to confer on them all the legal 
prerogatives created for others. 
<p>
<dd>Serious changes in the law and public policy should be discussed 
seriously, not evaded by the verbal sleight-of-hand of using the word 
"marriage." Marriage is more than a contract between two individuals. It 
is an assertion of an interest in those people's relationship, and its possible 
offspring, by the society at large. 
<p>
<dd>Gay activists are trying to have it both ways. If it is none of my business 
what they do, then it is none of their business what I think about it. Nor 
should I be forced to recognize it in word or deed. 
<p>
<dd>Emotional assertions of how much homosexual relationships mean to 
those involved are relevant only to those people themselves, who are free 
to make whatever contractual relationships they wish with one another, 
and to solemnize their relationship in whatever ceremony they prefer. But 
that is very different from trying to drag the rest of us into this, willy-
nilly, through laws which our elected representatives never agreed to 
apply to them.
<p>
<dd>In a sense, the gay marriage issue is only a further extension of the notion 
that a "family" means whatever anybody wants it to mean. But there 
would never have been such a word in the language in the first place if 
any group of people, with any kind of relationship to one another, was 
considered the same as any other. 
<p>
<dd>Families are not baseball teams, corporations, marching bands or 
computer clubs. What the law has evolved over centuries of experience 
with families need not apply to any other kind of association. Calling 
other kinds of relationships "families" is playing games with words, 
submerging the very concept in a sea of verbal mush. 
<p>
<dd>What our laws, our values, and our analyses have said about families was 
not meant to apply to any old set of people that might later be fashionably 
analogized to families. Such word games may be very clever, but all that 
they boil down to is that all things are the same, except for the 
differences, and different except for the similarities.
<p>
<dd>Gay activists have also thrived on the confusion between homosexuals 
and members of racial or ethnic minorities. But you are black or white or 
Chinese or Cuban, regardless of how you behave. Homosexuality is 
defined by behavior. 
<p>
<dd>It is one thing to say that all people have the same rights, as the 14th 
Amendment does, and something very different to say that all behavior 
has the same rights. There is no reason why the law should make all 
behavior equally acceptable to all people or surround all behavior with 
legal obligations on others. Once more the call for "equal rights" has 
masked an attempt to get special privileges, without having to play by the 
rules.

<h2>Giving Up Too Early</h2> 
<i>December 31, 1996</i>
</center>
<p>
<br>
<p>

"I give up, its over."  In today's fly by night world, that's all it takes to destroy one of the most important institutions in society, Marriage.
<P>
Isn't it time to repeal so-called "no fault divorce" laws that allow people to simply shed their marital commitment like a pair of dirty socks.  Over the past thirty years, no-fault divorce laws have been destroying marriage as an institution of life-long commitment.  Much like the debate over "same-sex" marriages, this is a debate over the definition of marriage.  Are we going to let marriage become simply a way of getting better health-care benefits and cheaper car insurance or are we going to elevate it as one of the most important institutions in our society.
<P>
This spring, Florida State Representative Steve Wise of Jacksonville will be introducing legislation to repeal Florida's twenty-five year old "no-fault divorce" law.  It will be a real battle as the liberal groups will try to scare the legislators into thinking the bill would legalize spouse-abuse or something.  On the contrary, it will stop the child abuse that results from a broken marriage.
<P>
When a man and a woman make a commitment to marriage, it is a commitment for life.   Adults get all the opportunities they want to date or meet different people but when two people decide to get married, they must understand what a significant and permanent step they are taking.  It is true that half of all marriages end in divorce, but this should not condemn us all.  Most people get married and stick it out through thick and thin.  The high rate of divorce results in large part because the same people are getting into multiple marriages and then ducking out several times.
<P>
A Florida women I talked with had four husbands since she was twenty and was now divorcing the fifth.   There were valid reasons for a couple of the break-ups but at least two of the marriages ended because they simple thought married like was too difficult.  The tragedy of this is that three children from three husbands were born.  She told me that all she had to do for the latest divorce was sign a simple form in one of those divorce chapels which work a lot like their counterparts in Las Vegas.
<P>
It is about time that we eliminate the term "irreconcilable differences" from divorce law.  All it really means is that the adults in question aren't mature enough to work it out.   Repealing the "no-fault" laws would mean that the person wanting the divorce would have to show cause such as desertion, abuse or infidelity.
<P>
Children are the biggest losers because of "no-fault" divorce.  1 out of 4 children live in a single parent home and a lot of these children could be saved by not letting there parents split up simply because they can't be bothered to go to counseling and work it out.  Anyone who's married will tell you that its not always a piece of cake.  You can't act like a selfish teenager anymore because you have to make sacrifices for the good of your new family.
<P>
We need to stop encouraging this trial-and-error attitude toward marriage and go back to where, as Bob Dole put it, "Your word is your bond."

God bless you in your efforts,<p>

<h2>The Presidency is Ill</h2> 
<i>December 30, 1996</i>
</center>
<p>
<br>
<p>

As a child, I remember being caught with my hands in the cookie jar.  Most of us do.  The President on the other hand never learned his lesson and has been found, along with his associates, hiding in the Mrs. Fields cookie factory, and as a result is bringing down the Presidency and the whole country.
<P>
The President's damage control team has tried to dismiss any comparison between the President's indiscretions and those during the Watergate scandal.   I have to agree that there is little similarity between the two and this needs to be made clear. Clinton's transgressions are worse.  Another excuse that is commonly heard from the administration is "its just politics, and everyone does it."  All one must do is list the number of scandals such as troopergate, Whitewater, filegate, and lippogate, to realize that this administration has been in the cookie jar far more often than the last forty years of presidents. No other President has broken his word and abused the trust of the people more that the current President.
<P>
It is beyond my comprehension that our President has continually put himself in circumstances that ethical people would know to steer clear of.   People sometimes get caught up in a bad situation that they later regret, but no one can excuse the repeated indiscretions on the part of the administration. Claiming that it was a "bureaucratic SNAFU" once,will work, but a dozen of them is hard to accept.
<P>
If I were to try to come up with a list of illegal activities that a sitting president could do, I would be hard pressed to come up with a longer list than that of the current occupant of the White House.  Clinton has surrounded himself with selfish political operatives like himself  instead of competent people interested in the country rather than the next election cycle.  The American people are growing tired of politicians serving their own interests.  Being President of the United States should be an honor, and should be treated as such.  To often, politicians who have won election think they have been given a blank check that doesn't have to be cashed until the next election. The government derives its power from the governed and our trusted elected servants need to remember that.
<P>
All to often, politicians win merely because of a spending advantage or better campaign staffs, and then make the mistake that the American people understood their entire campaign platform and agree with its entire contents.  This was evident in 1992 and 1996.  In 1992, no one knew what Clinton was about, but they knew he was anything but George Bush.  Likewise, in 1996, Clinton had no agenda other than he would be less severe than the Republicans.  The President won the election, but he must remember that he will have to give the White House up in four years.  Will he leave the presidency in better or worse shape.  The trend is becoming obvious.
<P>
Isn't it time that the American public stop allowing our elected officials on both sides of the aisle to disparage our great nation.  Shouldn't we hold our elected officials up to a higher standard than we may hold ourselves or our neighbors. How we ever got to the point where we have accepted that our President is not in the least bit ethical, I don't know.
<P>
The sickness in the White House is spreading, and unfortunately, it is beginning to affect the very honor of the Presidency.  The White House is up for sale and the Lincoln bedroom is for rent to the highest bidder.  And the owner is a guy named "Bubba."

<h2>Parents Get Side-Stepped Again</h2> 
<i>December 24, 1996</i>
</center>
<p>
<br>
<p>

Last week Jack Valente, the incredibly annoying and self-important president of the Motion Picture Association announced they he and the rest of the newly formed Television Council had finally reached agreement on a standard rating system for TV shows.  I give it a rating of "G" for garbage.
<P>
I was not overly excited when Congress and the President forced TV manufacturers to install V-Chips in all new TVs.  I feel that besides being an example of regulating us to death, It was also going to give parents a good excuse to leave their kids in front of the television and ignore their parental responsibilities.
<p>
But if the V-Chip is going to become a reality then it might as well be useful.  The garbage that the commission calls a rating system will do nothing for parents of children in all age ranges.  The primary problem is that the ratings are incredibly vague and don’t even cover news programs which I find often have the most violence and mature themes that we are trying to protect our children from.
<p>
Rather than make my point using shows like ABC’s NYPD which  we all regard as inappropriate for children, the focus should be on the middle of the road shows, and some shows which are supposedly family shows.  Because many shows will not be bad enough to warrant the most severe rating nor will they be timid enough to receive the "G" rating, a giant mushy middle will be left that will contain an incredibly large range of show content.
<p>
A good example of this problem is evident in the ABC Friday lineup of "family" shows.  ABC bills their Friday lineup as all family shows but quite often the theme becomes quite mature.  Issues such as dating, racism, religion and sex are common even in the family programs. Parents can not be sure that their favorite family show won’t end up showing a young boy and girl in a compromising situation. By then it is too late for the parent to intervene, and the parent must try to explain what happened.
<p>
The problem with the proposed system is that because of its vagueness, parents will not have any idea why a program received the rating it did.  It is because of this, that the rating system will be of little use to parents.  There is really no line that television won’t cross.  ABC even has a show about a teenage witch who often casts spells over her enemies.  As if  parents didn’t have enough working against them, news programs will be exempt from the ratings.  The thought that the evening news and even the tabloid shows like Hard Copy will not even be rated is quite ridiculous.
<p>
The television executives will tell me that I am a prude, and that a little kissing and  or witchcraft is okay for our children but I disagree and in the end, isn’t it the parents final decision what their children watch.  I plan to discuss sex and other mature issues when I feel it is appropriate, not when ABC, NBC, and CBS think so.
<p>
The new ratings system is just another case of the fox guarding the hen house. Groups like the Family Research Council and the Parents Television Council are pushing for giving parents more information to make there decisions.  Hopefully parents will get eventually get there due.
<p>
Until then, be careful.  You never know what is coming on the television next.


<p>
God bless you in your efforts,<p>

<h2>Democrats, Don't Kid Yourselves</h2> 
<i>December 23, 1996</i>
</center>
<p>
<br>
<p>
Democrats are celebrating this week because they believe that by getting the Speaker of the House to admit to a few improprieties, they are providing cover for their own problems with the illegal fundraising practices of the White House and the Democratic National Committee.  In a few months they will wake up with a hangover realizing that they were wrong.
<p>
For almost four years now, the truth about Whitewater has been slow getting out.  Republicans for the longest time, felt that this was their silver arrow that would bring down the president.  As we now know, it didn’t, in large part because it is too complex for most of the American public to care about, let alone understand.  The Democrats should understand that the complex tax laws that the Speaker is accused of admitted to bending, have the same qualities that stop the average American from caring.
<p>
It is my opinion that the American people are not so much concerned about whether every last tax regulation was complied with, but rather whether our political process is being corrupted. The Speaker is only accused of being too partisan when he was not supposed to, and hiring a poor lawyer whom he didn’t supervise enough. On the other hand, it is quickly becoming obvious that the DNC and the White House have systematically sold access to the Administration and political appointments to the highest bidder.  Only the prestige of the Presidency is saving Mr. Clinton.  If these revelations were coming out about a mayor or a city councilman, we would surely have heard the word "bribe" by now.  The big question concerning the political system is . . . . . . .   shouldn’t campaign/legal defense fund donations which are rewarded with ambassadorship, committee appointments, and policy positions be called what they are, Bribes?
<p>
In this great democracy, we (the average American) believe that the government derives it power from us, and that we all have a theoretical part ownership in its institution.  I for one, do not appreciate my 1/275,000,000  share of the Lincoln bedroom being rented out to drug pushers, arms dealers, a foreign businessmen trying to alter American policy.
<p>
The president has tried to cover-up his troubles by clinging onto the Campaign Finance Reform bandwagon.  What he doesn’t realize, it that we would be happy if he would just follow the laws that are on the books currently.
<p>
The current push for campaign finance reform is as misguided as the push just after the Nixon resignation.  The current system limits the amount of influence that the average American can have, giving all the power to wealthy Americans, corporations, and lobbyists.  That is as much as the liberals and I agree on.  The proper solution is not to limit spending more but to allow individuals to contribute more.   The fact that it costs a lot of money to run a house or senate race is not a problem.  This country is big and limiting spending will only limit the amount of information that is disseminated to average voters.  This would have the result of giving all the power to the inside the Beltway lobbyists.
<P>
If only there were stronger penalties for breaking the laws on the books, then maybe campaign laws would be taken seriously. Otherwise, the politicians will continue to recognize that it is easier to get elected and just pay the fine later.
<p>
Exploiting  the Gingrich story will not be enough to disguise the stench coming from the 1600 Pennsylvania Ave.  Trie, Huang, and all the rest of the fundraising dropouts are coming home to add to the smell.   
<P>
Anybody got a can of Lysol?

<p>
God bless you in your efforts,<p>

<h2>English Out, Ebonics In</h2> 
<i>December 20, 1996</i>
</center>
<p>
<br>
<p>

It has finally happened.  We have given up trying to educate our youth.  I don't see how we can expect to teach our children physics, or calculus if we can't be bothered to teach them proper English.
<p>
This week, the Oakland school board unanimously voted to recognize "black English" as a second language equal to that of Spanish or Chinese. "Ebonics," a term derived by combining the terms Ebony and Phonics, allows sentences with double negative such as "I'm not going back there no more." and with absences of the verb "to be" such as "she be at the store." Ebonics is heard on the streets and in many rap artist's songs.
<p>
In addition to this, the school district is likely to apply for federal money to pay for this bilingual education.  It's bad enough to recognize that sometimes youth create slang words like "awesome" or "cool", but to spend money encouraging it, is societal suicide.
<p>
Many blacks find this "give-up" attitude in education extremely patronizing. Steve Gooden, a black who attended the Republican convention in  San Diego said, "This cuts to the heart of the issue, --defining us as genetically deprived."  Many people worry that this might be an excuse to lower the education standards for the black community including Delain Eastin, the state education superintendent.
<p>
English is an incredibly complicated language, but it is necessary to make to effort to educate our youth, especially those from disadvantaged areas, in what the proper use of English is.  No one speaking in sentences with double and triple negatives is going to get chosen for a high paying career job. 
<p>
We have to expect more from our children, as they will only achieve what we ask of them.   We would not accept our children thinking two plus two equaled seven and we should not accept slang as proper speech.
<p>
As long as there a people on this earth, we are going to have different languages and dialects but we can hold to a single standard that can survive changes in the immediate culture.  It should not surprise us though.  Our society loves to soften rules.  Religious people of all faiths used to view their faith as the one true absolute and now you often hear people saying "I like that part of Christianity and that part of Buddhism or Judaism."
<p>
At a time when over fifty percent of high school seniors have tries an illicit drug such as marijuana, LSD, and cocaine,  and the global marketplace is putting increased emphasis on education, we should not be accepting street language as another national language.

<h2>Christmas Spirit?</h2> 
<i>December 19, 1996</i>
</center>
<p>
<br>
<p>
Many people across the nation think that our country is in a moral crisis and from the type of the news stories each evening describing murders, rapes, and adultery, I can't argue. For the next couple of weeks, though the Christmas season will fill most Americans will feelings of joy and hope. Hopefully it will remind people of our true calling in life: to be servants of our LORD.  Don't count on it.<p>

Last night, as I sat down to watch the news, I came across a shining example of the shallowness of the Christmas spirit. NBC had their annual Christmas special attended by dozens of celebrities, elected officials, cabinet secretaries, and the President and the First Lady, many of which have exposed their contempt for religious conservatives. 

<p>

Hosted by those ridiculous aliens from NBC's <i>Third Rock from the Sun</i>, it was one of the most overt commercial exploitation's of Christ that I have seen.  It made me really think what people really consider the definition of the "Christmas Spirit" to be.  The most common phrase uttered during to show was "season of peace and joy". Granted peace and joy is great, but Christmas is not the celebration of our ourselves. It is a celebration of the birth of Christ, our Savior.
<p>
Now, don't misunderstand me. I am not calling into question anyone's faith, but I do question why so quickly after Christmas, people forget what most of their favorite Christmas carols are about; the birth of Christ.
<p>
Ever since people of faith began to participate in large numbers in the political system, they have been under attack by the liberal establishment.  I've grown tired of hearing the term "religious-far-right-extreme conservative" used to describe every normal American who bothers to vote and happens to lead a life of faith in GOD.
<p>
The true spirit of Christmas should not end on January 2nd, when all the celebrating is over.  We must carry it over into our daily lives. Hymns and carols about Christ don't have to disappear after Christmas. We need to continue to be charitable to those less fortunate. And we need to remember the greatest gift we've ever received; the Savior from GOD.
<p>
Santa can't hold a candle to that.
<p>
Christmas is the celebration of a new life, and yet shortly after Christmas, I am sure we will hear more anti-religious bigotry from the left.  It won't be long before the issue of protecting unborn children will be before Congress, and I hope that the people we invest our trust and democracy to, will think back to this Christmas and the shape our nation is in and do the right thing. Protect another beautiful life.
<p>
God bless you in your efforts,<p>

<H2>Perspective On Dick Morris</H2></CENTER>

<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, AUGUST 30<br>







One view of the Dick Morris business is that he was, pure and simple, a technician. No different (to stretch the metaphor to the breaking point) from a computer. So the computer develops a virus? So -- since you can't eliminate this particular virus: only divine agents can accomplish that, and there is a long waiting list for their services -- you throw away the computer, and get another one. It's just that easy, that comprehensive. Next question?
<P>
The other view of it is that the computer in question had a very special hold over the President of the United States. Absolutely no one is denying that Morris was the architect of the post-Gingrich Clinton, the President who suddenly agreed that we had to balance the budget, who signed a welfare bill that surrendered final federal authority over welfare dispensations, who went so far as to recommend school uniforms to revitalize the sense of order and discipline in the chaotic little cloisters where the next generation is being taught how to behave. 
<P>
And then this second Morris was more intimately involved with the President than even the most advanced and malleable computer could be. When the news first reached Mr. Clinton, he said that Dick Morris was his friend, to whom he owed a great deal. He didn't quite say that he thought Morris not guilty of the charges leveled against him, but he did document his personal regard for him. And while Clinton was talking about Morris, Morris was writing about Clinton, in a statement that accompanied his resignation. What he said, in almost exactly as many words, was that he had picked Clinton up from the floor and propped him up to be, once again, a viable presidential figure. And then he went on to say that he had a very high opinion of the honor and character of Bill Clinton. 
<P>
But then of course the situation becomes complicated, because the two positions -- Morris as a mere computer, Morris as Rasputin -- crawl toward each other. So highly did Mr. Morris esteem the honor and character of Bill Clinton that he let his prostitute listen in on conversations over the telephone between the two men. Put it this way: There is no question that the man supremely responsible for Mr. Clinton's current focus on family values was himself scoffing at them. Morris (of course) says he was guilty of nothing (while writing out his resignation). From Clinton's end (through the chief strategist of the 1992 campaign, Paul Begala) we got the quiet dismay of a man temporarily on the rocks. ``I've been dealing with the press for 13 years, and I've always wanted to say this and I never was able to until this moment: No comment.''
<P>
It's hardly the end of the world for Bill Clinton. Lyndon Johnson had Walter Jenkins, his live-in amanuensis, who got caught seeking homosexual distraction in a YMCA a few weeks before the 1964 election. Nothing happened, unless one wants to attribute to that episode the loss of the five states won by Goldwater. The difference, however, is that Walter Jenkins's employer hadn't been repeatedly put down for licentious conduct, didn't have another confidant who committed suicide, didn't etc. etc. etc., all of which Mr. Clinton was engaged in trying to chase away into the shadows, using words in a speech substantially composed by -- Dick Morris. 
<P>
There has been much discussion lately of the question of presidential character. The subject came up when Senator Gary Hart was caught up in episodes of physical and moral relaxation, and of course it was what did Richard Nixon in. But Nixon's smoking gun wasn't merely an article in the <I>Star</I> documenting abandoned sexual conduct. ``Does it matter'' what a public figure does away from home? former mayor Ed Koch recently asked. After all (he continued) half of American marriages end in divorce and at least one half end, or don't end, with adultery in the picture. 
<P>
Surely one answer to that question is: What is the solemnity of the vow to fidelity taken by parties who contract marriage? Because the public is likely to reason (even if not justifiably) that to disdain an obligation under the one vow is to invite suspicion that the person in question would deal lightly with others. The incumbent President of the United States has taken two vows relevant here, the one to be faithful to the woman he married, the second to defend, so help him God, the Constitution of the United States.
<P> 
That's what the fuss is all about.<p>

The Networks May Boycott the Conventions? Good!</CENTER>

<P>	We are all supposed to be concerned that television's Ted Koppel left
the Republican convention early and is not even going to appear in Chicago
for the Democrats' show. At San Diego, the big three networks saw their
ratings plummet and they ascribe this failure to Republicans scripting their
extravaganza so tightly that no &quot;story&quot; (also known as &quot;bad
news&quot;) broke loose. Next week, the Democrats' shindig may be just as
impervious to negative media spin--as it should be, if the Democrats have
any sense. In this contrived atmosphere, the networks are warning us that
they will consider not covering the conventions at all in the year 2000.
They're going to take their cameras and go home.<BR>
<BR>
	Now I call that really good news! It will be an excellent improvement in
politics for the next millennium.<BR>
<BR>
	In fact, if the networks do show up at future conventions, the parties
should allow them in only if they agree to reduce the number of their cloying
&quot;analyses,&quot;  floor interviews and other speech-usurping, distracting
and tendentious pelf. In San Diego, half of each network hour was taken
up by the commentators and, of course, the ads.  For example, instead of
being allowed to watch a newly discovered political gem like J.C. Watts,
the eloquent black Republican Congressman from Oklahoma, network viewers
were left with synthetic pearls from TV's shopworn celebrities. What matters
to the networks is not airing the conventions, but re-airing conventional
wisdom.<BR>
<BR>
	Overall, network convention coverage probably subtracts more from a voter's
understanding than it adds, just as self-absorbed network coverage of last
spring's primaries represented a net loss of popular deliberation in that
process (average sound bite per candidate: 7 seconds!). We can count on
similar coverage of the serious public business at hand this fall. Perhaps,
therefore, it would be just as well if the networks decided to stop covering
the final election, too. We mustn't keep them from the important fires and
hurricanes and two-headed giraffes that increasingly interest them.<BR>
<BR>
	The best advice to both parties is to stop trying so hard to please the
networks and their celebrity minions. Especially when it comes to live coverage
of political conventions, you don't need them anymore. Since the rise of
cable TV, voters have much better options, ranging from CNN, which is at
least somewhat less intrusive than the broadcast networks, to the totally
unobtrusive C-Span--the best innovation in the cause of  good government
since punch-card voting. And there's always PBS, not to mention radio and
even the comedy channel, where the humor's intentional.<BR>
<BR>
	The parties increasingly will find it advantageous to buy their own time
on TV and put their message across the way they want it, which is just what
the GOP did this year. By 2000 we'll have some version of a &quot;teleputer&quot;
(in George Gilder's phrase), computers with interactive TV capabilities
controlled by the user.  The viewer will be able to do his own editing,
as it were, listening to a convention speech in full or cutting away to
interviews or analyses as he or she--and not some network producer--desires.
When that happens, network TV convention coverage will become largely unprofitable,
anyhow. No high ratings, no big ads.<BR>
<BR>
	Meanwhile, parties have every right--and maybe a duty-- to run their conventions
to suit their own purposes, not those of the TV networks. Party conventions
are the great gatherings of the political tribes, a unique chance to showcase
familiar political favorites and emerging lights, and, for that matter,
for the party workers and leaders to mingle with counterparts from around
the country. Simply getting the party's act together is a service to the
voters; it makes each party prepare early for the possibility of governing.<BR>
<BR>
	If these communal rites are less spontaneous now than in days of yore,
it bears remembering that the scripting of conventions to look like TV shows
is directly the fault of TV itself.  Television first covered a political
convention in 1948.  By 1952, the parties were beginning to change their
procedures to accommodate the demanding new medium. In early 1956 a novel
called The Golden Kazoo accurately forecast the parties' growing obeisance
to TV and the techniques of &quot;Madison Avenue,&quot; a satiric vision
that became reality by 1960.<BR>
<BR>
	Parties and voters accepted the likes of Walter Cronkite and David Brinkley
as &quot;moderators,&quot; sitting in Olympian judgment on mere mortal candidates.
Presidential aspirants trembled at the thought that such worthies might
criticize them, even implicitly, though the media code of the time usually
prevented the networks' power from being so exercised. And if it was exercised
sometimes, the politicians, and of course the public, were too unsophisticated
to figure it out.<BR>
<BR>
	Today, the bias--usually left wing, occasionally right wing,  but almost
always skeptical and demeaning to the people in politics--is much more common,
and also more commonly understood and resented. In respect to conventions,
in any event, the parties finally learned that what made for good network
TV was not necessarily  what made for good politics. Hence, the scripting.<BR>
<BR>
	By 2000, however, it may not matter. If the networks follow through on
their threat to boycott the conventions, the only question by then will
be, who cares?<BR>

<title>Linda Chavez: Californians can skip voting; judges overrule them anyway -- December 11, 1996</title>

<h2>Californians can skip voting; judges overrule them anyway</h2> 
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a>     
<p>
<dd><I>BETHESDA, Md.</I> - Maybe California voters ought to stay home next election. In some quarters their votes don't count anyway. 
<P>
<dd>Two years ago, a federal judge stopped the state from enforcing a measure which denied welfare to illegal aliens approved by 60% of California's electorate.  This year on election night, the television networks declared the victor in the presidential election before the polls closed on the West Coast.  And last week, a federal judge overruled a majority of California voters who voted Nov. 5 to end race- and sex-based preferences in state programs. 
<P>
<dd>This latest affront is the most galling, however, because it so grossly insults the intelligence and the decency of the voters. At issue is a ballot measure adopted by 54.5% of the electorate, Proposition 209, which banned both discrimination and preference on the basis of race, sex, national origin, or ethnicity in state employment, education and contracting.  The initiative was modeled on Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which forbids discrimination. Proponents of race- and sex-based preferences filed suit the morning after the election, alleging that the measure placed an unfair burden on minorities and women and thus violated the U.S. Constitution's guarantee that all persons receive equal protection of the laws. 
<P>
<dd>How could a measure that explicitly prohibits discrimination be discriminatory? 
<P>
<dd>How could language that explicitly forbids giving any group preference on the basis of race or sex unfairly disadvantage minorities and women?  Easy, according to the judge who issued a temporary restraining order barring the state from enforcing Proposition 209.  "Courts must look beyond the plain language of an enactment," Judge Thelton E. Henderson declared.  But if we can't trust that the words of our laws mean what they actually say, the whole basis of the rule of law falls apart. Suddenly we are in a world in which a judge can say, like Humpty Dumpty in Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, "When I use a word . . . it means just what I choose it to mean, nothing more or less."  All that matters, as Humpty tartly informed Alice, is "(who) is to be master." And lately in our democracy, judges have become masters of us all. 
<P>
<dd>In this case, the judge's own background casts doubt about his impartiality. Before he was appointed by President Carter in 1980, Judge Henderson practiced civil rights law in California and was on the board of the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California, one of the plaintiffs in the suit, along with California Rural Legal Assistance, Equal Rights Advocates and
other liberal advocacy organizations. These groups have long argued that it is not discrimination to give preference to some groups so long as they are minorities or women. 
<P>
<dd>By this logic it is not discrimination when Asian and white students must have higher test scores and grades than blacks or Hispanics in order to be admitted to a top university. Discrimination is just what affirmative action proponents say, no more or less. Judge Henderson claims that Proposition 209 places an unfair burden on minorities and women by denying them the right "to petition their state and local officials for race- and gender-conscious programs aimed at remedying discrimination." In fact, most such programs are the result of executive and court orders, not legislative action, anyway. Supporters of affirmative action have been unwilling even to admit that they want preferential, not equal, treatment, much less to put a proposal for those programs to a vote. 
<P>
<dd>Nothing prevents supporters of racial preferences from doing what opponents did: putting their own initiative on the ballot and letting the people decide. They are unlikely to do so, however, because most voters believe that racial preferences are wrong, period. Unlike liberal judges and civil rights groups, most people don't imagine you can end discrimination against one group of people by practicing discrimination against another. Judge Henderson may have trouble interpreting the plain meaning of the Constitution's guarantee that "no state shall . . . deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws." 
<P>
<dd>But most of the rest of us, including a majority of California voters, understand that to mean no discrimination and no preferences, just as Proposition 209 promises.

<P>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It is worry, worry, worry among the Chicken Littles on the right over Bob Dole's campaigning.  Everyone is in a panic.  But the sky is not falling.  In fact, victory is in the bag for Mr. Dole.  And we take our predictions seriously.  We were the first, on Nov. 22, 1994, to predict Bill Clinton's rejuvenation if the Republicans tried to govern from Congress, and we do not make prognostications lightly.
<P>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
We have the luxury of having been there before.  It is hard to recall, but in the summer of 1980 all the campaign and media talk was about Ronald Reagan being too old.  He made front-page "gaffs" almost daily.  As a result, a Gallup poll found Gov. Reagan behind President Carter 31 percent to 65 percent at the beginning of the year and as late as June trailed 32 percent to 37 percent for Mr. Carter and 24 percent for John Anderson.  On Aug. 18, 1980, it was Mr. Carter 39 percent, Mr. Reagan 38 percent and Mr. Anderson 14 percent.  Those in the campaign never felt comfortable that Mr. Reagan could win and the media were certain he could not.  Ours was a lonely voice in the campaign even to recommend that "the Gipper" debate Mr. Carter.  And that was the concern with a candidate later called "the Great Communicator."
<P>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In other words, there is nothing new about panic over campaigns during the doldrums before the convention.  As far as dissatisfaction from the right, remember the grumbling among conservatives during the summer of 1998, some threatening a third party? Then George Bush promised at the convention that fulfilling the Reagan legacy was his "mission" and "read my lips, no new taxes."  After that, the right was won and enthustiastically worked for his election.
<P>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
This time Bob Dole won the nomination with a conservative appeal but reached out to moderates afterward.  That is because he knows two things.  It is smart politics now, and he knows that the platform will be conservative, the speeches and the convention acceptance will be too, as will be the vice-president, and so will the campaign and the ads.  It made sense to reach out to moderates now, before the dominant theme re-emerges. After all, what difference does a keynote speaker make?
<P>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The desperate search for a new leader is ludicrous.  Where is one to look? To Congress? The panic on the Hill is manifest.  After more than a year of predicatbly foolish strategy, now it is everyone for himself on welfare, health, spending, legal services, affirmative action, minimum wage, etc.  Taking Medicaid -- the biggest part of welfare reform -- out of the bill so President Clinton can sign it is an outrageous elect Clinton-and-us-GOP-Congress strategy.  Or are we supposed to look to candidates that Mr. Dole defeated or who declined even to run against him?  They lost.  To Colin Powell as vice president?  That would simply increase the chorus for the presidential candidate to step down in his favor.  There, simply, is no magic solution, and one is not needed.
<P>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
How will Mr. Dole win? He starts with 37 percent, almost exactly what Mr. Reagan had at the same stage of the contest. Politics is a 40-40-20 proposition at the national level, 40 percent Democrats, 40 percent Republicans and 20 percent in the middle.  In a three-way race, solidifying the base gets almost to the victory line all by itself.  The only real problem in the polls now for Mr. Dole is his weakness with the GOP base.  Depending on the poll, he wins only 61 to 70 percent of Republicans, when he needs 85 percent.  That present weakness translates to strength when Mr. Dole convinces the 85 percent at the convention with a strong issue appeal.
<P>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What about the problem with women?  The Linda Divall-American Viewpoint poll shows this is almost exclusively a problem with older women.  For both older men and women, Mr. Dole must respons successfully on Medicare.  But he needs funds that are not available now to do so.  The real problem is younger men.  For both younger men and women, he needs a strong anti-tax, pro-jobs/growth plan.  These will come.  The good news is the problem is not abortion nor the social issues.  For people who will cast their vote on these issues, these are still a net positive for Republicans.  For abortion, a Wirthlin poll shows that 26 percent of voters say their ballots will be influenced by this issue -- and 17 percent are pro-life and 9 percent pro-choice.
<P>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
With these bases covered, there is one important latent aspect to the campaign -- as there was in 1980 -- the good citizen who loves his country.  Mr. Clinton's support is artificially high today because that voter still looks at him and sees the president of the United States of America.  After the Democratic National Convention, he is Candidate Clinton.  Come Election Day, voters will go to the polls thinking, "He is a caring young man and he tries, but I just cannot see the presidency dragged through the courts for the next four years on sexual harassment, Arkansas cronies, land deals, cattle futures and the rest.  Bob Dole is a good man and I will support him."  This will be especially important for three-fourths of Ross Perot-leaning voters who are male, as it was for a similar group regarding the hostage crisis in Iran in 1980.  Mr. Perot will be left with liberal-leaning people who do not like the incumbent -- as Mr. Anderson was -- and Mr. Dole will win.
<P>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Mr. Clinton will be like Mr. Carter in 1980 -- it will be late, but support will dive quickly.  It will be all over, and there will be President Dole.  It is in the bag.

<title>Pete Du Pont-- Silence of the Lamm -- 08/14/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<blockquote><blockquote>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/">
<img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p>
<i>Wednesday, August 14, 1996</i><p>


<h2>Silence of the Lamm</h2><p>

<a href="http://www.townhall.com/townhall/columnists/dupont.html">Pete du Pont</a><p> 
<i>Pete du Pont, former Governor of Delaware, is Policy Chairman of the 
National Center for Policy Analysis</i><p>

So, is America ready for a third-party?  Ross Perot thinks so.  So 
does David Broder of the Washington Post, who writes that by 2000, a 
third party will be a major political force in America.
<p>
But if there were a third party, what would it stand for?  What would 
its policies be?  These are the questions bothering the third party we 
already have - Ross Perot's Reform Party - because to date it is a 
party of one man, not a party of ideas.  If it is going to have any 
impact on the American political process, the Reform Party must become 
a party of ideas.
<p>
Take the case of former three-term Colorado Governor Dick Lamm, who is 
trying to get his message out to members of the Reform Party in a 
effort to win the party's nomination for president.  So far, he has 
had only moderate success
<p>
Lamm contends that the Reform Party, founded and largely funded by 
Perot, has hampered his campaign by refusing to let him have members' 
addresses so that he could reach them by mail.  In addition, his 
repeated requests to debate Perot were declined.  Reform Party 
officials deny having done anything to hinder Lamm's campaign or his 
ability to reach party members.
<p>
Lamm stepped into the Reform Party process for two reasons:  He wanted 
a national platform on which to discuss the problems American is 
facing and he apparently believed Perot when for months the Reform 
Party founder denied having any desire to be nominated and run for 
president of the United States.
<p>
Unfortunately, the national media have focused almost entirely on the 
internal struggle for power rather than the issues Lamm and the Reform 
Party have been pushing.  As a result, Lamm's message has been 
silenced.
<p>
But were he able to get his message out he would warn Americans of a 
number of impending problems.  For example:
<p>
<b>Social Security reform</b> - The Social Security system is going bankrupt.  
At its current rate of growth, the trust fund will begin drawing on 
reserves by the year 2013 and will be broke by 2030.  Since our 
elderly population is growing much more rapidly than workers, there 
simply won't be enough workers to keep Social Security solvent.  The 
later we wait, the worse it will be, so we must develop a solution 
now.
<p>
<b>Medicare reform</b> - Medicare is going bankrupt even faster than Social 
Security.  According to Medicare's trustees' report, Medicare Part A 
(which pays hospital bills) will go into the red by 2000 and be broke 
just a year or so later.  Republicans passed a Medicare reform 
proposal, only to have it viciously attacked by the Democrats.  As a 
result, the notion that Medicare is politically untouchable is 
prevailing once again.  That's an attitude we can't financially 
maintain for long.
<p>
<b>Fiscal responsibility</b> - Reagan-era tax cuts increased federal revenues 
between 1981 and 1989 by an average of 1.8 percent per year, after 
inflation.  Unfortunately, the Democrat-led Congress increased 
spending by 2.3 percent.  That disparity explains the increased 
deficit spending during the Reagan years.  Bob Dole wants to cut 
taxes, but keep the budget balanced.  Would Lamm do the same?
<p>
The problem is that Dick Lamm has spoken out on these and a number of 
other issues over the years, but the media have focused so much on 
Lamm's political struggles, they have failed to give due attention to 
his solutions to our problems.
<p>
That's too bad, because Lamm is a serious politician with a message 
Americans need to hear and consider.  His may indeed be a "root-canal" 
vision of our future - all cuts and no gains - but it is a very 
definite political message that may force the Republicans and 
Democrats to deal with politically difficult issues that candidates 
might otherwise sweep under the table.
<p>
I don't believe Lamm's message will resonate.  Americans are 
optimists, believing, in Steve Forbes' words, in "hope, growth, and 
opportunity."  Lamm's pessimism will be a hard sell.  Further, I would 
disagree with those who say there is a political longing unfulfilled 
by the Democratic and Republican parties.
<p>
To have an impact, third-party candidates will need to debate the 
message, not the man.  So far all we've heard is Ross Perot.  Maybe 
it's time to see what Dick Lamm has to say.  
<p>

<h2>Brown v. Board of Ed, Pt. II</h2><p>


<i>If you're sick and tired of judicial activism, take heart. It may not last much longer.</i><p>



"We are constrained by many rules and taxed for many costs that we as self-governing people did not choose for ourselves but were chosen for us by judges who thought they knew better," observes Richard Morgan, professor of Constitutional Law and Government at Bowdoin College. Writing in the Summer issue of the Manhattan Institute's City Journal, Morgan argues that the 1954 Supreme Court decision in Brown v. Board of Education "ushered in the modern era in constitutional law," an era in which the courts came to be viewed "as a source of governmental power that could force unpopular changes that could not be secured through representative institutions." Over the last three decades, the courts "have removed issue after issue from the arena of popular decision and subjected them to judicial control."<p>

Morgan laments the dramatic changes that have taken place in America since the 1960s, "when judicial social engineering based on the Brown model took hold. Huge new bodies of judge-made law constrain us on all sides," he observes. "New restrictions on what Americans can do in their communities, state legislatures, and the national Congress are being fabricated apace. It is no accident that this period of imperial expansion by the judiciary coincides with a period of precipitous increase in the American social problems and a decline in the quality of life, especially in our cities," says Morgan. "The courts did not cause the decline, but they often have made it more difficult for communities, through the processes of self-government, to cope with their problems. In the decades since Brown we have seen our churches and other voluntary institutions . . . increasingly isolated from the public square; we have seen our schools destabilized, our law enforcement enfeebled, the maintenance of order in our streets undermined, and major public-sector institutions taken over and run by judges."<p>

There was no popular support for such judicial abuse in the beginning, nor is there any now, and yet it continues. "After decades of conservative electoral outcomes and hundreds of state and federal judicial appointments intended to end 'judicial legislation,' and with public opinion sullenly resistant to much of the social engineering ordered from the bench, how is it that legally unjustified judicial interventions into policy making and administration still occur routinely?" asks Morgan. "Why does our sprawling 'rights industry' continue to grow and succeed so often in persuading judges to establish policies that cannot be put in place through the normal democratic processes of election and legislation?"<p>

Though leaving such questions unanswered, Richard Morgan insists that the days of judicial activism are numbered. He argues that "curtailing judicial legislation is an absolutely essential part of reinvigorating self-government and arresting social decline in America at the end of the century." The best way to begin, says Morgan, is by recognizing the error in Brown.<p>

<h3>A Celebration of Indoctrination</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
November 25, 1996

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;


	Okay Sherman, set the Way Back Machine for 1984. President Reagan is running for re-election against Walter Mondale, and he's way ahead in the polls. Sort of like Clinton v. Dole, only the other way around politically.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	So one day, one of Reagan's chief economists -- David Stockman, let's say -- represents the White House at a ceremony honoring a couple of teachers from Sacramento, Calif., where Reagan served as governor. What have the teachers done to merit this recognition?  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	They have taught their elementary school pupils the wonders of supply-side economics! Public school children are enrolled in a program where they learn the story of "Boom Town" where taxes are low enough so people can invest in the economy. The economy booms, bringing more revenue into government coffers than ever could have come in had taxes been raised. The program is run by the public schools. As Mr. Stockman beams and the network cameras roll, the school kids recite such ditties as "Taxes Are Bad, Taxes Hurt, Don't Let the Feds Take Our Shirts." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Of course, we know how the headlines will read the next day. Front page, full scream in the <i>Washington Post</i>: "REAGAN ADMINISTRATION APPLAUDS INDOCTRINATION OF KIDS IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS," with a sub-head: "Children Recite Supply-Side Dogma For OMB Director."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Is this fictitious scenario hard to believe? Not at all. Just move that dial Sherman, up to 1996 and the Clinton administration, and switch the politics around. Almost everything else is the same: On the 21st of October, Joseph Stiglitz, President Clinton's chief economist, represented the White House at an awards ceremony honoring two elementary school teachers, Deborah Shearer and Geanie Davis, from Little Rock, Ark. What had the teachers done to merit this recognition?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	They had taught their pupils to spout a message the current administration would love to hear from school children -- and parents -- across the land: Don't cut taxes. Using the taxpayers' money, the teachers had taken it upon themselves to teach children the story of "Ginger Town," "using cookies to drive home the concepts of scarcity and wants," as one account put it. The children had learned ditties like "Oh Scarcity, Oh Scarcity! We Cannot Have It All. We Really Want A Lot Of Stuff, But Sometimes There's Just Not Enough." "We have unlimited wants for goods and services," explained little Kelsie Brown, who learned the term "wants" -- along with other economic jargon -- in kindergarten last year!
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"The main message of the program, funded by the school, was that taxes aren't so bad," one report said. "They learned that there are many things that are important that are publicly provided," said Ms. Shearer, who seems to have no idea that government funding is not something ordained by God in the scheme of things. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Nor does she seem to bat an eye at the idea of using public funds to teach one side of an issue to students whose parents may totally disagree with her position. Ms. Shearer, of course, would be outraged -- and justifiably so -- were the situation reversed.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"I wish you teachers had been more active 50 years ago, because then we would not now be faced with the Dole economic plan," Mr. Stiglitz beamed as reporters scribbled at the pre-election ceremony. No kidding!
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	And speaking of reporters, there is, of course, one thing different about the two scenarios presented above: If President Reagan's White House had been party to such a stunt, the news media would never have let them hear the end of it. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The media reaction to Mr. Stiglitz's celebration of indoctrination? You guessed it.

<title>Fumento: Greens Still Trying to Salvage Their Alar-Stained Reputation - 12/18/96</title>

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>
<i>December 18, 1996</i><p>
<h2>Greens Still Trying to Salvage Their Alar-Stained Reputation</h2><p>     
<P>
     They're mad as hell and they're not going to take it anymore.  For almost seven years
environmentalists have had to put up with people (like me) crying, "Remember Alar!" as
shorthand for bogus science and health scares. But now, they're striking back.
<P>
     For those who don't recall, the Alar scare began in February, 1989 when reporter Ed
Bradley began a 60 Minutes segment by calling Alar "the most potent cancer-causing agent in our food
supply." Alar, manufactured by Uniroyal Chemical Co., was sprayed on apples to keep them on
trees longer so that fewer would fall to the ground and rot before they could be picked.
<P>
     It was this substance that the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) decided to
scapegoat to illustrate the horrors of man-made chemicals. The 60 Minutes segment was part
of a campaign by a PR firm the NRDC had hired, called Fenton Communications.  The rest of
the campaign consisted of helping reporters write scary articles, enlisting the support of
actress Meryl Streep, and creating an NRDC front group called Mothers and Others for
Pesticide Limits.
<P>
     In short order, terrified people were dumping their applesauce into the trash, apple
juice down the sink, and swearing off apples entirely for "healthier" foods.  (You know, like Hostess
Twinkies.) Soon Uniroyal felt it had no choice but to stop selling its product to apple
growers, some of whom then went bankrupt.
<P>
     In the ensuing months, though, articles, monographs, and even whole books by myself and
many others revealed that the NRDC-Fention effort was, as I put it, "one of the slickest,
most cynical fear campaigns in recent American history."  Few people dispute this nowadays,
and it drives the environmentalists bonkers.
<P>
          Thus author and long-time environmental doomsayer Paul Ehrlich, in his new book
<U>Betrayal of Science and Reason</U>, calls the Alar debunking a "fable." A recent article in the Columbia
Journalism Review (CJR), published at the nation's most prestigious journalism school, was
entitled: "Myths," with the subtitle informing us "The Alar `Scare' Was Real."
<P>
     Their evidence, however, is embarrasingly flimsy and often downright false.  For one,
the NRDC and other environmental groups claim the EPA banned the chemical. CJR writer Elliot
Negin gives a date for the ban, saying the decision was "in late 1989." Ehrlich informs us
that three years late, "the EPA issued a statement reaffirming the sound scientific basis
for banning Alar."
<P>
     Sorry Charlies, but the EPA never banned it in the first place, much less reaffirming
any ban. Once Uniroyal withdrew the product for use by fruit growers, the EPA considered the issue
moot. Further, to this day Alar continues to be used on plants which don't produce food.
<P>
     A simple phone call to the EPA would have revealed this.  But apparently
environmentalist crusaders have better things to do with their time.
<P>
     Any other evidence?  Well, Negin makes much of the fact that Washington State apple
growers lost their suit against 60 Minutes alleging their products were wrongly disparaged.
<P>
     In the wake of the decision in the O.J. Simpson criminal trial, such utter confidence
in the court system is truly touching.  But in any case, the courts didn't rule that Alar is
carcinogenic or evil or anything like that. They simply said the apple growers had failed to
meet the extremely high standards needed to win a suit against a media outlet.
<P>
     Finally, both Negin and Ehrlich and other revisionists remind us that both the EPA and
the International Agency for Research on Cancer had labeled Alar "a probable human carcinogen."
Neither writer points out that the studies these agencies had relied upon to make this
classification later proved to have been terribly sloppy. That's why the EPA had
commissioned several new ones. But the NRDC, rather than await the outcome, decided to
launch its scare campaign instead.
<P>
     Neither writer points out--nor do any other environmentalists--that all the evidence
against Alar was always based on the findings of tumors in mice, while the same doses of chemical
caused no tumors in rats. The EPA had simply arbitrarily decided that mice in this case were
a better surrogate for humans. Had the rats developed the tumors and not the mice, they
could well have decided that mice were the better surrogates.
<P>
     All of this is explained in detail in my book Science Under Siege.  Ehrlich, for one,
quotes from that book repeatedly, in an attempt to refute it.  But rather than meet its arguments
head on, he simply ignores them.
<P>
     This, alas, is all too typical of environmentalists.  Evidence that challenges their
world view is inadmissable to them. All that matters is that their myths live on forever. 
Alar-as-deadly-poison was a myth in the making that was cut off at the knees--and deservedly so.

The American President

Kathleen Howley
</a>

<P>
Everyone needs a hobby. Mine is trying to figure out the way Liberals 
think. Every time I think I have it nailed down, though, the Liberals 
pitch a curve ball.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Take, for example, "The American President," the movie about a highly 
paid female lobbyist who has an affair with the widowed President of 
the United States.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To Liberals, she's an "old-fashioned girl," because, after all, she 
waits until the third date to spend the night at the White House. Not 
the first date, mind you -- she's no tramp, after all. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The president's young daughter gets wind of the ongoing affair. She 
approves, as it turns out. When the relationship becomes public and 
some Angry White Male Conservative senators object, they're dismissed 
as being "intolerant."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Of course, the simple solution to the controversy is for the president 
and his girlfriend to get married. It would shut up the big, bad 
Conservatives, and, since it's an election year, it would also give 
the president a boost in the polls. The whole country would fawn over 
the newlyweds. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But, it never comes up. The word "marriage" is never spoken -- not by 
the Conservatives, as they plot their election coup. Not by the happy 
couple, as they snuggle in front of the fire at Camp David. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Here's the part that's hard to understand: Liberals perceive the 
president -- a character modeled, obviously, on a spiffed up version 
of Bill Clinton -- as a man of integrity, despite the bad example he 
sets for his daughter. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
That view becomes apparent in the final scene, when the president 
makes a dramatic stand in defense of Liberal environmental 
legislation. Yes, I could almost hear the Clintonites sobbing in 
admiration. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
How could a character with no moral backbone be portrayed as being 
honorable? 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's the same question I was left with at the end of "Primary Colors," 
the anonymous account of the Clinton campaign.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sure, Gov. Jack Stanton (read: Clinton) sleeps with every female in 
sight. Sure, he impregnates the teenage daughter of a friend. Sure, 
he's a pathological lier.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
He really CARES about America, though. And that makes everything all 
right.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Meanwhile, Mrs. Stanton/Clinton is no slacker when it comes to 
extramarital affairs. According to the book, she sleeps with Henry 
Burton, alias George Stephanopoulos. But, that's dismissed as merely 
being "campaign sex."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At the end of "Primary Colors," Gov. Stanton/Clinton is presented with 
some under-cover dirt on his opponent. Leaking it to the press would 
secure the primary nomination. But, it's just dirt about sex and drugs 
-- nothing really bad, from a Liberal's perspective. Should he use it? 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
One of his aides tells him, "We don't do this sort of thing. We're 
better than that." In the end, Stanton/Clinton decides to take the 
high road.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Once again, I could almost hear the Liberals weeping in admiration. 
What a man of courage! What a leader!  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It explained to me why there have been no denials forthcoming from the 
White House about the book -- no statements of shock or dismay. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
You see, to Liberals, it's a relatively positive portrayal. Yes, the 
candidate has a fatal flaw in his inability to be faithful to his 
wife. But, that doesn't really count. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
He refused to engage in "dirty tricks." And that makes him a hero. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
You might ask yourself: how could two groups of Americans -- Liberals 
and Conservatives -- view the same events with such a radically 
different interpretation? How can Liberals dismiss sexual morality 
from the mix, when deciding who has integrity and who doesn't? 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
More to the point, how can the Liberal-dominated media lionize 
characters who have such obvious flaws? 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's because the Liberals are working from a different set of rules. 
And, as long a politician doesn't break the Liberal code of 
conduct, he's a man of integrity. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In short, they follow Ten Commandments, too. But, they're a bit 
different from the code that has guided Christians through the 
millenniums. The Liberal version is: 
<p>
<ol> 
<li>) Thou shalt be nice, except to people who are Conservatives. 
<li>) Thou shalt be inclusive, except to Conservative views. 
<li>) Thou shalt ignore the Lord's Day, unless you are a politician and 
need a "photo op" as you exit a church. 
<li>) Thou shalt blame thy mother and thy father. 
<li>) Thou shalt kill the old, the sick, and the unborn, but 
passionately defend the lives of death row criminals. (Unless you're 
an election-year politician who wants to look "tough on crime." In 
that case, kill them all, including the criminals.) 
<li>) Thou shalt commit adultery, and engage in any other mode of 
sexual expression, with any gender. But, thou shalt not feel guilty. 
<li>) Thou shalt steal, if it helps to re-distribute wealth. 
<li>) Thou shalt lie, if it furthers the Liberal cause. 
<li>) Thou shalt covet thy neighbors wife. 
<li>) Thou shalt covet thy neighbors goods. 
</ol>

<h2>Small-Business Agenda Faces an Uphill Battle</h2>
by <a href="/sbsc/kerrigan.html">Karen Kerrigan</a></center>
<P>
<hr><P>



What happened to the year of small business?  In 1995, the 104th Congress 
championed a legislative agenda to foster entrepreneurship and small-business growth.  But 
advancing small-business legislation proved to be more difficult than most Washington observers 
expected.  Many of the issues that were priorities of the small business lobby were labeled by the 
Clinton administration as giveaways to the rich or special breaks for big business.<p>
For example, efforts to reduce capital gains and estate taxes have been decried as 
benefitting a special few.<p>
And legislation that would have made federal government regulators more accountable to 
small business has been portrayed as a legislative license for big corporations to pollute the 
environment.<p>
Even when Congress and President Clinton eventually sign off on a budget agreement, 
incentives that were specifically targeted for small business will be vastly watered down or 
tossed aside in the name of compromise.<p>
What can small businesses and entrepreneurs expect from Congress and the Clinton 
administration in 1996?<p>
Election years tend to produce a stale legislative environment so the answer may very 
well be "not that much."  On the other hand, the president may attempt to solidify his traditional 
base of support during the election year by offering proposals that translate into votes at the 
ballot box in November.<p>
For example, the president's inclusion of a federal minimum wage increase in his budget 
plan represents an olive branch to labor unions, which view the administration's stand on labor 
issues as weak.<p>
In Congress, business proponents  --  mostly Republicans  --  will continue to advance 
issues popular with the small business community.  Important matters to small businesses, such 
as overhauling the nation's tax system as well as tax and regulatory reform in general, will 
continue to generate scores of congressional hearings and legislative proposals in Capitol Hill.<p>
When push comes to shove, though, will small business see substantive reforms?<p>
The Small Business Survival Foundation recently revisited the agenda set forth by nearly 
1,800 small business delegates at the June 1995 White House Conference on Small Business.  
The following is an update on the top five recommendations that came out of that conference:<p>
<b>Issue No 1:</b> Independent Contractor Clarification.  Most small businesses believe the 
IRS's 20-factor test to determine the employment status of independent contractors is too 
subjective.<p>
  Republican Jon Christensen of Nebraska introduced legislation to clarify the definition 
of independent contractors and streamline the current 20-factor test to only three criteria.<p>To date, the House Ways and Means Committee has not acted on the legislation, and the 
administration has opposed efforts to simplify the 20-factor test.  However, Christensen's efforts 
are expected to receive a hearing by the powerful tax-writing committee in the near future.<p>
<b>Issues No 2:</b> Meal and Entertainment Deduction. Conference delegates called upon 
Congress and the president to enact legislation allowing a 100 percent tax deduction for meals 
and entertainment.  Recent tax laws reduced the deduction to 50 percent.  Although the 100 
percent deduction may be a priority of small  business, it ranks low as an action item in 
Congress.  Politically, the issue would be a ripe target for opponents, who will label it as just 
another perk for the wealthy.<p>
<b>Issue No 3:</b> Regulatory Flexibility Act/Regulatory Reform.  Small business wants federal 
regulatory agencies to determine the costs of their proposed rules and regulations on the small 
business sector.  Amending the Regulatory Flexibility Act, as recommended by conference 
delegates, would increase the likelihood that cost-impact studies are done by regulators.<p>
The act, combined with a host of other regulatory reforms, passed the House but has 
stalled in the Senate.  Most observers believe all efforts to reform the regulatory system are dead 
for 1996.  Clinton has called the House measures, and similar legislation in the Senate, "too 
extreme."<p>
<b>Issue No 4:</b> Repeal the Federal Estate Tax. Family owned businesses are especially hard 
hit by high estate and gift taxes.  Many businesses fail to make it to the next generation due to the 
burdensome nature of such taxes.  Conference delegates overwhelmingly voted to repeal these 
taxes.  The estate-tax issue has become political fodder for class-warfare rhetoric. Even minor 
efforts to increase the estate-tax exemption from $600,000 to $750,000 have been vastly watered 
down.  The Clinton administration opposes abolishing estate and gift taxes but some estate tax 
relief will probably make it to a final budget deal.<p>
<b>Issue No 5 (tie): </b>Superfund Reform and Health-Care Reform: Many small businesses get 
trapped in what is known as the Superfund web, held liable for expensive government 
environmental cleanup schemes when their actions were legal at the time they disposed of waste.  <p>
Republican Mike Oxley of Ohio has introduced legislation to reform Superfund, but the 
bill does not repeal retroactive liability before 1987  --  a key component sought by reform 
proponents.  Even if a weak bill makes it to the president, he would likely veto the legislation.  <p>
The No. 1 reform on the health-care wish list was the adoption of tax-deductible medical 
savings accounts.  MSAs are included in the budget plan passed by Congress but are opposed by 
the Clinton administration.  Supporters believe that MSAs will probably be part of a final budget 
agreement. <p>
Conference delegates also called for the 100 percent tax deductibility of health care costs.  Small businesses will most likely see an increase to 50 percent phased in over a seven-
year period.<p>
On an optimistic note, at least small businesses won't have to ward off major proposals 
that increase their taxes or regulatory burden.  The only redflag is the President's proposal to 
raise the minimum wage.  A threat perhaps, but the small business lobby has become too 
powerful to allow this to happen.

<i>6/5/96</i><hr><h2>CONSERVATIVES STUCK IN THE PAST?</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/pascoe.html"><i>Bill Pascoe</i> </a>
</center><hr>

<P>


                              
<P>
A fascinating test of the ability of conservatives to adapt to changing strategic realities in
the post-Cold War world will emerge on the House floor this week, as Indiana Republican Dan
Burton seeks to restrict U.S. aid to India.  The outcome of the vote on his amendment to the
1997 foreign operations appropriations bill will determine, in large measure, the attitudes of
India's new government toward the United States at a critical point in the development of a new
and positive strategic relationship between the world's most powerful democracy and its most
populous one.
<P>
For decades following its independence from British rule in the 1940s, India was governed by its
Congress Party, whose early leaders -- Third World giants like Indira Ghandi -- sought to play
both sides against the middle in the Cold War.  As one of the largest countries in the world
(home to one-sixth of the world's population), it naturally was accorded leadership status among
the broad coalition of Third World nations that sought alliance with neither the West nor the
Soviet bloc.  Its establishment and leadership of the Non-Aligned Movement, begun at the United
Nations in the late 1970s, marked it as an emerging power.
<P>
But even as India was claiming to be non-aligned, it tilted toward the Soviet bloc.  A "Treaty
of Friendship" between India and the Soviet Union, signed in 1971, was widely -- and correctly
-- interpreted by Western conservatives as a sign of India's true inclinations on the world
stage. Similarly, its antagonism to Pakistan -- a critical strategic ally of the West in the
Afghan proxy war -- weighed the scales against any serious efforts at developing a U.S.-India
strategic relationship.
<P>
Internally, however, the Congress Party government was establishing a vibrant democracy.  Beset
by radical separatist movements backed by its foreign adversaries -- and the resulting
human-rights abuses inevitably found in such situations -- India nevertheless established itself
as a true parliamentary democracy, with major and minor parties and a thriving free press.  It
seemed only a matter of time and circumstances before India and the U.S. would establish a solid
relationship.
<P>
The Berlin Wall fell seven years ago.  The Soviet Union imploded.  Democracy of a sort came to
the Soviet bloc.  And in India, circumstances -- though perhaps not so dramatically -- have
changed as well.
<P>
A new government came to power in India last week, replacing the Congress Party government
that had ruled India for all but four of the last 49 years.  The U.S. is now India's largest
trading partner; the Commerce Department has named India one of the "Ten Big Emerging Markets,"
and estimates opportunities worth at least $100 billion over the next five years in just one
sector of a rapidly-emerging free market economy.
<P>
Just as important, since 1991, the U.S. and India have been conducting joint military exercises.
The emergence of such a strategic relationship with India -- a nation with a 4,000-mile long
border with China -- becomes all the more critical to the development of a new U.S. foreign
policy toward Asia in light of the Clinton Administration's mishandling of American relations
with Russia and China.  Given the fact that for the first time in decades Moscow and Beijing are
now closer to one another than either is to Washington --  threatening a critical underpinning
of U.S. foreign policy -- a new strategic relationship with India could assume critical
importance in the decades to come.
<P>
Enter Mr. Burton, for whom time apparently is at a standstill.  Last week he inserted into the
Congressional Record a speech denouncing the Indian government for human rights abuses that took
place twelve years ago, and urging that -- on the basis of those abuses -- Congress restrict aid
to India until the President certifies to Congress that India has made progress in cleaning up
its problems.  Apparently, he hopes to form a floor majority based on Republican deficit hawks
opposed to foreign aid in general and liberals who profess concern over alleged human rights
abuses.
<P>
Mr. Burton's amendment, however, would cut not a single penny from U.S. aid, and is aimed at
punishing a government that had nothing to do with human rights abuses that occurred more than a
decade ago.  Moreover, with a critical vote of confidence for the new Indian government
scheduled for next week, now is precisely the wrong time for the U.S. Congress to vote against
India.  In New Delhi, it would be interpreted as a gratuitous slap, and could even contribute to
undermining the fragile coalition government that just assumed power -- possibly bringing to
power a government dominated by the very people Mr. Burton professes to oppose.
<P>
Last year, Mr. Burton fell just a handful of votes short of passing his amendment and punishing
India.  In the intervening year, much has changed in India -- for the better.  Will the House
recognize those changes, and defeat his amendment by an even larger margin?  Will conservatives
demonstrate they can adapt to the changing realities of the post-Cold War world, and lead the
move to the creation of critical new strategic relationships -- or will they reinforce the
caricature of hide-bound Neanderthals unable to break away from previous doctrine?  The vote
this week will give us the answers we seek.

<h2>Who are the True Liberals?</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/rockwell.html">
 Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr.
</a>
<P>
<BR> 
 The word is: the word "liberal" is out. It won't even
be heard at the Democrat convention. Hardly anyone will admit to
being a liberal anymore, meaning a tax-and-spend, 
guilt-manipulating, counter-cultural statist out of touch with
the regular guy. Even left-wing activists prefer the term 
"progressive."<P>
Of course, the Democrats are as liberal as ever, as we've 
come to understand the term. That is, they identify more with the 
government than with the governed. But this approach is an 
electoral loser.<P>
People believe they are being governed--taxed, regulated,
and otherwise pushed around--to death. Never in the history of
American polling has the federal government been so unpopular.
If "liberalism" is about supporting and expanding this
system, liberals will indeed have to find a new ideological cover. <p>

May they succeed! For the word liberal really belongs to those who favor the free economy and society: the sense in which the word is now used in Eastern Europe. The authentic liberal tradition, dating from the 17th century, is properly identified
with the intellectuals and popular movements who struggled against government power.<p>
Liberalism was born in Spain, when the followers of St. 
Thomas Aquinas discovered how economic freedom works to build
a prosperous society. The writings of the late-scholastics, 
centered around the School of Salamanca, bloomed into a worldwide
movement of "los liberales".<p>
In France, the liberals included A.R.J. Turgot, Jean 
Baptiste Say, and Frric Bastiat. In Britain,
Richard Cobden, John Bright, and Herbert Spencer. In Austria, Carl Menger, Eugen von Bhm-Bawerk, and Ludwig von Mises. In America, Patrick
Henry, Thomas Jefferson, and William Sumner. <p>
Liberals in this classical tradition understand the connection between welfarism and tyranny, big government and empire, central planning and poverty. Their goal is to establish the rule of law, decentralize government, and let capitalism flourish. <p>
How liberalism came to mean the opposite in this country is a twisted tale. Unlike the Old World, where being on the right meant supporting tyrannous regimes and empires, the New World was conceived in liberty. When the centralists and egalitarians began to undo this, beginning in 1861 and continuing to this day, they
purloined the name liberal for themselves. <P>
Yet even as late as the 1920s, some people who called themselves liberals had no beef with capitalism and self-government. They wanted to protect individual rights from
government power. They would never have countenanced a government
that taxed 40 cents on the dollar, promised cradle-to-grave security,
or forbad freedom of association. <p>
But the New Deal changed that. In the name of liberalism, a northeastern elite fastened a vast coercive apparatus on the country, and took us away from liberty and toward the very tyranny the constitution's framers were hoping to prevent.<p>
The term &quot;conservative&quot; didn't come into common use
for another generation. The opponents of the New Deal had no name
for themselves. They liked the name liberal, but with the term stolen
by their opponents, they resorted to cumbersome names like 
"anti-collectivist," "individualist," and
"America firster."<p>
In the post-war period, liberalism has meant consolidating 
and expanding the New Deal framework, while conservatism came
to mean fighting the Cold War, and preferring tradition to ideology. The really serious opponents of collectivism--those who favored capitalism and peace, economic freedom and civil liberties, property rights and states rights--had no name for themselves.<p>
The right term for these political views is "liberal."
But it ' s very difficult for the rightful owners of a word to take
back its meaning while their opponents are using it. After the American Revolution, for example, the centralizers adopted the term "federalists" and called their Jeffersonian opponents "anti-federalists". To this day, the meaning of "federalism"
is ideologically ambiguous. <p>
Rightly defined, liberalism is the view that society should not be centrally controlled, managed, or shaped by government.
Society manages itself, from the bottom up. Consumers, workers, investors, entrepreneurs, parents, and volunteers form 
communities of enterprise and mutual support, while the central
government is not seen, or heard, or felt. <p>
Today the American political landscape is dominated by two 
anti-liberal parties. One loves the welfare state, the other 
loves the warfare state. One wants to stamp out tobacco, the 
other would use the military in the war on drugs.  &lt;p&gt;<BR>
The fullest defense of the liberal society ever penned came 
from Ludwig von Mises in 1927 as  Liberalismus . Only this 
tradition, he said, can save civilization from Nazism, fascism,
communism, socialism, and social democracy. His warning wasn't
heeded, but when the term is reclaimed, Mises's book should be
the platform. <p>
<i>Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr., is president of the Ludwig von Mises 
Institute in Auburn, Alabama.</i><p><br>

<h2>Why the District Is Different</h2>
By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/schatz.html"> Thomas A. Schatz</a><br>
President,<br><a href="/govt-waste/home.html">Citizens Against Government Waste</a> 
 <P></center><hr>
 <P>
Many taxpayers outside the District of Columbia are saying, "Why is D.C.
getting so much attention and what's all this talk about a flat rate
federal income tax of 15 percent?" After spending nearly two decades as a
District resident and half of that time as a critical observer of
government spending, I admit bias and more than a little pride in my
response, as well as good reasons to move ahead with D.C. Delegate Eleanor
Holmes Norton's plan.
<P>
This is, after all, the nation's capitol. Instead of being the butt of
late-night talk show jokes, every patriotic American should be demanding
that the District be the crown jewel of U.S. cities, and the envy of every
world capitol.
<P>
Just try walking the nearly four-mile round trip from the Capitol to the
Washington Monument. It's safe, it's beautiful, and there's nothing like it
in any other city. Tourists marvel at the sights, and despite rumors that
make the District sound like the Wild West, they still visit in droves.
<P>
Even with its inability to address bloated and inefficient government, D.C.
is not particularly large, nor are its problems insurmountable. Bold and
decisive leadership would do the trick. But progress along these lines
still would not address a fundamental fact: The city's population is
declining rapidly. In the first five years of the 1990s, the population
dropped as much as it did in the entire decade from 1980 to 1990. And many
of those leaving were African-American and middle class.
<P>
The Norton plan is simple -- lure people back into the District by lowering
federal taxes. Support for the bill includes House Speaker Newt Gingrich
(R-Ga.), Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas) and Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott (R-Miss.). Bipartisan companion legislation has been introduced
in the Senate by Democrat Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut and Senate Joint
Economic Committee Chairman Connie Mack (R-Fla.). Members of the Maryland
and Virginia delegations are also supportive: Rep. Roscoe Bartlett (R-Md.)
said it could help the entire region become more prosperous, and Rep. Tom
Davis (R-Va.) is moving forward quickly with hearings before his House
Government Reform and Oversight Subcommittee on the District of Columbia.
<P>
The opposition to the proposal comes from the traditional proponents of
class warfare (the plan benefits the rich more than the poor), and people
in other cities who want the same deal. House Ways and Means Committee
Chairman Bill Archer, seeking a more comprehensive tax reform plan, is not
yet in favor of the Norton bill.
<P>
But Washington is different, and it's well worth the projected annual $700
million in lost revenue to the Treasury. We only need to look at a small
portion of the $160 billion in annual federal spending that my organization
-- Citizens Against Government Waste -- identifies as wasteful spending to
find the necessary offsets.
<P>
For example, Congress could eliminate the Market Access Program ($90
million), the Economic Development Administration ($348 million), the
Advanced Technology Program ($300 million), the Appalachian Regional
Commission ($140 million), and the Strategic Petroleum Reserves ($109
million) and the National Biological Survey ($115 million). These
half-dozen programs total $1.1 billion, more than enough to meet the cost
of this new program.
<P>
The issue is not finding the savings, it's convincing skeptics on Capitol
Hill that it's OK to lose control over hundreds of millions of dollars and
that people in D.C. and people who would want to live in the District --
nearly two-thirds of whom are African-American -- really will know how to
spend the money they save from the tax cut.
<P>
The class warfare argument is specious: Individual taxpayers making $15,000
or less; single head of households at $25,000 or less, and joint filers at
$30,000 or less will pay NO federal tax. That means more than half of D.C.
taxpayers will simply be taken off the rolls. Is there any more direct
manner in which to help and reward hardworking lower income people than to
strengthen their ties to their community?
<P>
For those who continue to pay taxes, but at lower rates, the potential for
creating or expanding business is phenomenal. There are 31,000 sole
proprietorships in the District, meaning they pay the individual income tax
rate. Assuming that a tax of $28,000 (28 percent) on business income of
$100,000 would be reduced to $15,000, that $13,000 would no longer be
diffused throughout the national economy, but would be largely directed at
local spending and investment. The resulting savings is enough to hire a
full-time employee, purchase new equipment, or retire outstanding debt that
will lead to additional business opportunities.
<P>
The kicker in the tax reduction scheme is the elimination of capital gains
taxes for investments in D.C. by District residents. So what would a
<P>
logical person do with their savings? Invest it in local businesses.
<P>
That's what I plan to do -- in fact, I pledge that one-third of the savings
I will obtain from lower taxes will be invested in D.C. businesses, either
directly, or through market opportunities. If every D.C. taxpayer followed
this lead, there would be approximately $233 million (assuming one-third of
the $700 million in revenue lost to the federal government) available for
investment in D.C. Or, if only the richest taxpayers (1994 figures) -- the
4,396 whose income exceeds $200,000 and who paid $600 million, or 35.2
percent of D.C.'s $1.7 billion in taxes -- did the same, there would still
be more than $82 million for city business. Or take the 15,313 returns for
people making more than $100,000 annually. They paid $900 million, or 52.9
percent of 1994 taxes, meaning if they pledged one-third of their savings,
there would be more than $123 million to increase the city's employment and
business base.
<P>
Best of all, that money would not flow through the inefficient hands of the
federal bureaucracy, and it would remain where people know best how to use
it. With what's left over, charitable Washingtonians could support local
nonprofits, the arts, schools, and religion, all of which will be more
direct help to the needy than the federal or local government could ever
provide. And let's not forget what it would mean for this city to have
people wanting to move in, rather than out, of the District. Beyond the
obvious greater tax base, we would enhance the support of institutions that
are key to long-term urban health -- our neighborhoods and our schools.
<P>
All of this may be too logical for the bean counters and those ready to
write off the city's future. But most Americans have a vision of our
nation's Capitol that is rooted in the past and looking to tomorrow. The
Norton plan is the best way to get us all on this hopeful path.

<h2>            
Feminist Assault On Reasonableness
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/schlafly.html">Phyllis Schlafly </a><p><BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
                    


     Now that women are attending law schools in greater numbers,
     feminists are turning up as law school professors, law review
     writers, state legislators, congressional staffers, prosecutors,
     law clerks, and even judges. The result is ominous for basic
     concepts of American law and justice, and an excellent policy
     analysis on "feminist jurisprudence" by the Cato Institute
     explains why.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The feminist goal is not fair treatment for women, but the
     redistribution of power from the "dominant class" (the male
     patriarchal system) to the "subordinate" class (nominally women,
     but actually only the feminists who know how to play by rules
     they have invented). They even want to establish a license for
     women to kill their allegedly abusive spouses.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     They have peddled the fiction that men are engaged in a vast
     conspiracy against women, that something like 85 percent of
     employed women are sexually harassed in the workplace, and that
     something on the order of 50 to 70 percent of wives are beaten by
     their husbands. They want to establish the rule that offenses
     against women should be defined (not objectively, but
     subjectively) on the basis of how the woman felt instead of what
     the defendant did.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Before the feminist movement burst on the scene in the 1970s,
     there were literally hundreds of laws that gave advantages or
     protections to women based on society's common sense recognition
     of the facts of life and human nature. These included the
     prohibition against statutory rape, the Mann Act, the obligation
     of the husband to support his wife and provide her with a home,
     special protections for widows (e.g., one state gave widows a
     little property tax exemption, another prescribed triple
     penalties against anyone who cheated a widow), and laws that made
     it a misdemeanor to use obscene or profane language in the
     presence of a woman.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The premier feminist lawyer in the 1970s, Ruth Bader Ginsburg,
     argued that all such differences of treatment based on gender
     were sex discriminatory and, therefore, should be abolished. She
     won several Supreme Court cases on that theory, and, in state
     after state as well as in Congress, feminist lawyers persuaded
     legislators to gender-neutralize their laws.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     In theory, Ginsburg appeared to demand a doctrinaire equality,
     opposing the Mann Act because it "was meant to protect weak women
     from bad men" and that was demeaning to women. But in practice,
     she demanded affirmative action for women even in the military.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Now the feminists don't even pay lip service to a gender equality
     goal. They have launched a broadside attack on such basic
     precepts as equality under the law, judicial neutrality, a
     defendant is innocent until proven guilty, conviction requires
     proof beyond a reasonable doubt, and guilt or liability should be
     judged according to the traditional "reasonable man" theory.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Female plaintiffs had always been able to sue for unwanted sexual
     overtures in the workplace by using the common-law remedies of
     tort and contract. Feminists reject this remedy because they want
     sexual harassment cases to be based on the notion of a male
     conspiracy to victimize women and that a "hostile work
     environment" is a form of sex discrimination prohibited by Title
     VII of the Civil Rights Act.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The Supreme Court adopted this feminist theory in the 1986 case
     of Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, where the Court even went so
     far as to say that "'voluntariness' in the sense of consent" is
     not a defense. These notions had been invented by Michigan Law
     School professor Catharine MacKinnon, who was reported to have
     boasted, "What the decision means is that we made this law up
     from the beginning, and now we've won."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     A 1991 Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision replaced the
     common-law "reasonable man" standard with a "reasonable woman"
     test, embracing the feminist notion that men and women can't see
     the same events in the same way. The court declared that the old
     common-law standard "systematically ignores the experiences of
     women."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     Now the feminists are demanding the "unreasonable woman" rule.
     The feminists want the victim rather than the law to define the
     offense.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     In a 1991 Jacksonville, Florida case, a federal district court
     found an employer guilty of a "hostile work environment" even
     though there was no evidence of sexual language or demands
     directed at the plaintiff who claimed she felt sexually harassed.
     The other female workers said they did not feel sexually
     harassed, but the judge said that merely provided "additional
     evidence of victimization."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The feminists are actively promoting college speech codes to
     prohibit what they call discriminatory or harassing speech. They
     argue that it's just as actionable for a man to call a woman
     "honey" or "baby" as to call her a "bitch"; and, of course, jokes
     are not allowed. Nearly 400 colleges and universities have these
     anti-First Amendment speech regulations, about a third of which
     target mere "advocacy of offensive or outrageous viewpoints or
     biased ideas."
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     The feminists want the battered woman syndrome to free any woman
     from conviction of violent crime. The feminists are even pushing
     the Catharine MacKinnon notion that all heterosexual sex is rape
     unless an affirmative, sober, explicit verbal consent can be
     proven.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     They want the action of a battered woman who kills her husband to
     be considered as normal, and that killing a man in his sleep can
     be called self-defense.
<BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     More lawyers, scholars and academics are badly needed to speak up
     and expose the feminist foolishness for what it is: a scurrilous
     attack on our Bill of Rights.

COMERCIO LIBRE O MANIPULADO

COMERCIO LIBRE O MANIPULADO
</H2>
Carlos A. Ball*
<br>
<p>
MIAMI (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>)
 (AIPE).- Los beneficiarios del libre comercio son los consumidores,
quienes entonces gozan de libre acceso a los mejores y más baratos productos
y servicios de todo el mundo. Los enemigos son los empresarios ineficientes
que no pueden competir, los sindicatos de industrias que por sus altos
costos hacen mal uso de escasos recursos y los políticos intervencionistas
que reciben contribuciones y apoyo electoral de quienes se oponen al libre
comercio.
<P>
 En los últimos tiempos ha surgido un poderoso nuevo enemigo: grupos
ecológicos activistas que ven la industrialización como la peor amenaza a
sus utópicos deseos de que no hayan cambios en la naturaleza. Son grupos más
preocupados por la supervivencia de insectos que por el bienestar y
crecimiento económico de seres humanos que habitan sus adorados desiertos,
pantanos y junglas. Si en el siglo pasado estos grupos ambientalistas
hubieran tenido el poder político que hoy gozan en Estados Unidos y el apoyo
económico de multimillonarias fundaciones privadas, este país no se hubiera
industrializado y a lo mejor hubieran logrado devolverle Manhattan a los
indios. Ellos se han convertido en los peores y más fuertes enemigos del
desarrollo latinoamericano, ahora que el nacionalismo socialista está en
evidente decadencia.
<P>
 Los aranceles y demás barreras al libre intercambio comercial perjudican al
consumidor nacional, aunque con ello los políticos y burócratas pretenden
perjudicar al empresario extranjero, en beneficio del empresario local.
Siendo esto así, lo lógico sería que los políticos eliminaran todas las
barreras al ingreso de productos y servicios extranjeros, pero ello va
contra su fibra dirigista, su desconfianza en el mercado que no es más que
desconfianza en la habilidad del pueblo de tomar sus propias decisiones y,
sobre todo, no quieren perder la habilidad de castigar o complacer a
enemigos y amigos, que es lo que en realidad coloca poder en sus manos.
<P>
 El TLC/NAFTA ha sido un éxito a medias. Sus diseñadores quisieron estar
bien con Dios y con el diablo. Se abren las fronteras, pero si los precios
baratos de tomates y aguacates mexicanos afectan a agricultores
estadounidenses se aplican excepciones al tratado. Después de todo, las amas
de casa aquí no van a chillar porque los tomates les cuesten diez centavos
más, pero los agricultores sí pusieron el grito en el cielo ante esa
"injusta" competencia. Lo mismo pasa con los transportistas mexicanos, a
quienes se les sigue prohibiendo entregar mercancía más acá de la frontera,
en defensa de los intereses del sindicato de camioneros norteamericano. Eso,
claro está, no es libre comercio sino manipulación política electorera.
<P>
 Un interesante informe secreto del Banco Mundial se filtró recientemente a
la prensa y deja muy mal parado al supuestamente exitoso Mercosur, donde lo
mismo que en el TLC/NAFTA lejos de reducirse unilateralmente los aranceles
se construyó un inmenso mamotreto artificial, para proteger los intereses
empresariales más poderosos en Brasil, Argentina, Uruguay y Paraguay. El
intercambio comercial aumentó de $4.200 millones en 1990 a $12.300 millones
en 1994 entre los cuatro países, pero resulta que el grueso de ese aumento
ha sido en vehículos y maquinaria agrícola que antes se importaban, a
mejores precios, de Asia, Europa y Norteamérica, pero que ahora provienen de
ineficientes fabricantes argentinos y brasileños.
<P>
 El proteccionismo regional, que es el objetivo de los burócratas que se
pasan la vida en los mejores hoteles del mundo negociando acuerdos
bilaterales, representa apenas una leve mejora sobre el proteccionismo
nacional. Las cuotas de importación y altos aranceles impuestos por Mercosur
lograron que el comercio intra-regional en vehículos aumentara de $207
millones en 1988 a $2.100 millones en 1994, pero con ello se termina
perjudicando su capacidad interna de competir con el  mundo exterior, ya que
los altos precios de vehículos y maquinarias aumentan los costos de
producción de los miembros de Mercosur.
<P>
 Esto es lo que los economistas llaman "desviación" del comercio. Los
paraguayos preferirían comprar carros buenos y baratos de Corea en lugar de
modelos viejos y caros de la Argentina. Pero la industria automotor en la
Argentina y Brasil es muy poderosa políticamente, determinando muchas de las
decisiones de Mercosur. Existe algo más potencialmente peligroso que un
político intervencionista local: un burócrata intervencionista
supranacional. Por ello, los ambientalistas enfilan sus campañas hacia las
Naciones Unidas y demás agencias multilaterales. ©

    Anything related to conservative political interests is welcome on the C-News list, so long as it is not discussion. For example, we welcome:<p>

<LI>Policy reports or essays from conservative interest groups<P>
<LI>News items: Excerpts from newspapers/magazines of news that would not be 
available elsewhere or is a breaking story<P>
<LI>Information on election results and campaigns of conservative candidates<P>
<LI>Book reviews<P>
<LI>Announcements of upcoming events<P>


<hr>

<P ALIGN=Center><B>List Policies to Keep in Mind:</B></P><p>

-    Although in a list such as this posts may often be rather long, we 
 would ask that you post the complete text of something only if it is not 
 available elsewhere. For example, articles from _Policy Review_ are  
 available via WWW at <a href="http://townhall.com/">Town Hall</a>. Instead of          
 posting an entire article, post a citation and information on how to get the  
 article.<p>

-  Also, we would ask that complete posts from C-News not be cross-posted; 
 C-News has been established to eliminate the need for cross-posting. 
 However, there is no problem with forwarding excerpts for discussion 
 purposes.<p>

-  PLEASE do not forward C-News posts to the White House, the media or to 
 Congressional offices. When you do that, all that happens is a.)the
 message gets deleted by whoever receives it, and b.)the person who
 posted the message to C-News gets bombarded with "Thank you for
 your comments..." messages from the offices.<p>

-  If you want to scan something in to post to C-News, be sure to 
 edit it for scanning errors and layout problems. Posts that are
 scanned and have excessive errors <B>will not</B> be accepted.<p>

-  Finally, have fun!<p>
