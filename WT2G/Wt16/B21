<h1>The Greatest of These is Love</h1>
<h2><i>A Faith-Based Alternative to the Welfare State</i></h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>I</font>n an 1844 essay entitled &quot;True and False 
Philanthropy,&quot; American preacher William H. McGuffey unwittingly 
diagnosed the ills of the modern welfare state.  McGuffey draws a 
contrast between a &quot;Mr. Fantom&quot; and a &quot;Mr. Goodman.&quot; 
Mr. Fantom begins: &quot;I despise a narrow field.  O for the reign of 
universal benevolence!  I want to make all mankind good and happy.&quot;
Mr. Goodman responds that &quot;one must begin to love somewhere;
and I think it is natural to love one's own family, and to do
good in one's own neighborhood, as to anybody else.&quot;  Mr.
Goodman laments of Mr. Fantom, &quot;And so, between the great
thing he cannot do, and the little one that he will not do, life
passes, and nothing will be done.&quot;

<p>

Today, the onset of moral relativism has driven a wedge between
those reformers who hope to promote moral uplift and those who
aim only to relieve material needs.  But in 1844, Mr. Fantom and
Mr. Goodman did at least agree that the object of benevolence
was &quot;goodness&quot; and &quot;happiness&quot; -- or, in more
sophisticated parlance, virtue and individual fulfillment.  Mr.
Fantom and Mr. Goodman parted ways in defining the means to achieve
those ends, and their differences frame the central questions
confronting contemporary reformers.

First, should the locus of our action be the individual or

good&quot; by coercion, as Mr. Fantom aspired, or in &quot;doing
good&quot; in the context of freedom, along with Mr. Goodman?

<p>

Simply limiting the size of the welfare state will not yield
a sparkling rebirth in the nation's naked cities.  Limiting government
will be necessary, but not sufficient, to repair cultural rot.
The insufficiency of libertarian means, however, does not imply
the existence of some proactive political means that will be adequate
to the task.  Restoring our society will require embracing a vision
of moral autonomy and inherent dignity for every individual.

<p>

<center><h3>Individual or Collectivity?</h3></center>

<p>

Nature has revealed two fundamental truths about man.  He
is perpetually weak and flawed, but also rife with potential for
love and renewal.  Personal failing, in fact, often contains the
seeds of renewal because it discredits an exalted sense of the
self.  By reflecting on the dynamics of human weakness, reason
itself can apprehend a higher law rooted in God, to whom man must
hold himself accountable.

<p>

Conservative theorist Frank Meyer argues that the cornerstone
of civic morality in the West is the Great Commandment &quot;to
love the Lord thy God with all thy heart . . . and thy neighbor
as thyself.&quot;  In reflecting on this mandate, Meyer introduces
a paradox.  By ignoring utterly everything but God and individual
persons, the world's most famous invocation to selflessness has
established the individual squarely at the center of the Western
tradition.  The individual must be &quot;the central moral entity,
and society as but a set of relations between persons -- not as
an organism morally superior to persons,&quot;[1] Meyer writes, because
&quot;no community, no state, no association -- only persons,
individual human beings -- can receive the beatific vision or
be redeemed by the divine sacrifice of love.&quot;[2] The words
are radical in implication.  They ask those who believe in the
divine sacrifice of love to acknowledge that healing the culture
will depend on the interaction of individuals, not the clash of
abstract political entities.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<font size=+1><b><i>
Should the locus of our action<br>

all mankind good' by coercion,<br>
or in 'doing good' in the context<br>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The concept of &quot;interaction,&quot; of course, is a necessary
corollary to the emphasis on the individual.  Meyer's vision of
social harmony, after all, rests on a vision of the individual
redeemed, and man is redeemed only by acquiring a sense of something
larger than himself.  Through a rich and vast array of daily interactions
with each other, individuals mature into complete human beings
with a sense of self-control, but also a sense of connectedness
and mutual obligation.  The state's role in fostering man's nobler
impulses depends ultimately on nurturing, not individuals directly,
but all the small groupings into which human beings organize themselves
-- outside of and distinct from government.

<p>

The moral superiority of individuals meeting each other face
to face, in the space we call &quot;civil society,&quot; emerges
with particular force in the story of a woman named Clara Hale.
A poor woman in her mid-sixties, living in a poor neighborhood,
Clara Hale took in a baby born with a drug addiction and went
on to found Hale House, a group home for addicted children in
Harlem.  &quot;It was Clara Hale who did this,&quot; Michael Joyce
writes, &quot;not an expert, not a bureaucracy.  Had she exercised
her citizenship in the modern, tragically devalued sense of that
term, Clara Hale would merely have advocated through voting and
political activism, more programs for state-funded professionals
to care for these children of God.&quot;  But she did not turn
away from them and speak to society, in the abstract.  She held
each child, one by one, and spoke their names to them.  &quot;Clara
Hale's sense of citizenship, her active and direct participation
in service to her fellow man, displays the vibrancy and proves
the superiority of civil society,&quot;[3] Joyce concludes.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The proliferation of need is a cry for a new generation of
Clara Hale's, with an acutely personal sense of moral responsibility.

<p>

<center><h3>Freedom or coercion?</h3></center>

<p>

If the moral development of the individual is the central
concern, then liberty and virtue must be the twin ordering principles
of political and social life.  The pursuit of virtue is the highest
moral good, but it cannot be a political question.  Virtue depends
on individual freedom of choice and can be neither exercised by
collectivities nor achieved by political coercion.  F. A. Hayek
once wrote:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

Freedom is the matrix required for the growth of moral values
-- indeed not merely one value among many but the source of all
values.  It is only where the individual has choice, and its inherent
responsibility, that he has occasion to affirm existing values,
to contribute to their further growth, and to earn moral merit.[4]

</i>

</blockquote><p>

The only political means to promote virtue, then, is to establish
and maintain freedom for the individual.

<p>

If virtue depends on the preservation of liberty, however,
it is also true that the maintenance of liberty depends on the
status of virtue.  The meaning of freedom encompasses much more
than the absence of coercion or an abundance of options.  Because
a democratic society requires citizens to be capable of governing
themselves, freedom cannot be an end in itself.  As Lord Acton
put it, &quot;Liberty is not the freedom to do what you wish;
it is the freedom to do what you ought.&quot;  Libertarian means,
in short, must serve traditionalist ends, while traditionalism
must resist the temptation to use coercion to promote its own
ends.

<p>

The only satisfactory balance between virtue and freedom
is a vibrant civil society, that sphere of life that includes
all the institutions and interactions that stand between the individual
and the total state.  While the elemental building blocks are
the family and the church, civil society also encompasses the
Boy Scout troop that builds hiking trails for the community, the
school that teaches young ones how to read, and the homeless shelter
that keeps its doors open thanks to dedicated volunteers.  Civil
society may be as formal as the Red Cross chapter that has secured
its 501 (c)(3) tax status or as informal as an afternoon gathering
of young mothers at a neighborhood park.  It is both Hale House
and your house.  Sharing stories around the dinner table, holding
hands with a new widow, or looking men directly in the eye at
the local soup kitchen -- this is the stuff that softens hearts
and melts social barriers.  By maximizing opportunities for service
to one another, civil society promotes the strength of character
that safeguards against freedom's atomistic tendencies.

<p>

The freedom that allows civil society to thrive is, in fact,
much more likely to engender strong communities than the isolated
individuals of liberal myth-making, for human nature predisposes
man to live life in communal settings.  Alexis de Tocqueville
wrote in <i>Democracy in America</i>:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

The township is . . . so well rooted in nature that wherever men
assemble it forms itself.  Communal society therefore exists among
all peoples, whatever be their customs and laws.  Man creates
kingdoms and republics, but townships seem to spring directly
from the hand of God.[5]

</i>

</blockquote><p>

The prospects for civil society do depend critically, however,
on the preservation of the nuclear family as the basic unit of
society.

<p>

<center><h3>A Revival of Family</h3></center>

<p>

While his name is almost synonymous with self-interest, Adam
Smith also observed a near-universal human attribute of sympathy
that he identified as the source of human moral sentiments.  Although
distinct from altruism, Smith's notion of &quot;sympathy&quot;
inspired man to seek the approval of his fellow citizens by functioning
in ways that sustained healthy communities.  Endorsing Smith's
hypothesis, John Adams wrote in 1790 that &quot;as Nature intended
men for society, she has endowed them with passions, appetites
and propensities calculated . . . to render them useful to each
other in their social connections&quot;[6] -- if only to win the
love and esteem that gratify the self.

</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Along with the right of man to be free and independent, the
Founders asserted a strong belief that man was most magnanimous
when functioning as a free individual.  Jefferson for his part
argued that men have an instinctive moral sense that compels them
to respond with assistance when their neighbors are in distress.[7]
In examining the scientific evidence to test Jefferson's contention,
James Q. Wilson found ample evidence that individuals do have
a &quot;moral sense&quot; and that it is formed out of their earliest
interactions in the family.  Scholarly studies of altruism, for
example, demonstrate that &quot;the general pattern of warm familial
relationships is striking.&quot;  In a study of Christians who
rescued Jews during the Holocaust, the long-term rescuers were
very close to their parents, one or both of whom held strong moral
convictions.  And the same pattern reappears in a study of people
who were active for long periods in the civil rights movement
during the 1960s.  Compared to those who were only briefly involved,
the fully committed activists had a warm and close relationship
with one or both parents.[8]

<p>

By fostering human relationships of a type that are not always
found in the wider society, the family fulfills an indispensable
social function.  As the Pope wrote in <I>Familiaris Consortio</I>:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

The relationships between members of the family community are
inspired and guided by the law of &quot;free giving.&quot;  By
respecting and fostering personal dignity in each and every one
as the only basis for value, this free giving takes the form of
heartfelt acceptance, encounter and dialogue, disinterested availability,
generous service and deep solidarity.[9]

</i>

</blockquote>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

In reviewing a wide variety of studies in developmental psychology,
Wilson found that generous children were indeed raised by parents
who offered nurturing love and consistent discipline and who themselves
engaged in helping others.  Rather than caring intensely only
for members of the immediate family, children and adults who experienced
love at home were precisely the people who were most likely to
aid perfect strangers, often at risk to themselves.[10]

<p>

The empirical evidence, then, provides a powerful rebuttal
to the conception of the moral agent as an abstract force, stripped
of the intimacy and particularity of the family ties that undergird
moral experience in everyday life.  Michael Novak argues that
moral realism itself is the one habit learned in the family that
is most essential for successful self-government:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

[F]amily life is no utopia.  It isn't meant to be.  Its purpose
is to instruct us in the painful but also mind-enlarging angularities
of human nature.  Such realism, vital to any free republic, arises
from having your own self-images punctured, from learning to endure
tragedies together, from penetrating one another's weaknesses,
and from learning to forgive, to love, to be tolerant, and to
support.  Without such learning how could any civil society survive?[11]

</i>

</blockquote><p>

In order to have meaningful content, love for humanity, for the
stranger on the street corner, must evolve from the privilege
of basic human affections -- the experience of one heart knowing
another.

<p>

While grounded in moral realism, acts of personal kindness
elevate and ennoble the doer from within; and in learning the
unique worth of love, theologian Walter Rauschenbusch observed,
we learn to feel the worth of those we ought to love.[12] Thus, love
undergirds both moral autonomy and a sense of the dignity that
belongs to every individual.  Political coercion, by contrast,
is a flimsy tool for social cohesion.  &quot;The frequency with
which our communities have to fall back on . . . coercion is a
symptom of the failure of love, for love can usually dispense
with force.  The more love, the less force; the more force, the
less love,&quot;[13] Rauschenbusch wrote.

<p>

To the extent that centralized government usurps the space
in which families and neighbors thrive -- and thereby politicizes
all relationships -- it trumpets reductionist individualism and
denies the power of love.  Collectivism makes its mistake in assuming
that virtues like selflessness and generosity are a part of human
nature.  Asserting that man has a moral sense (or a variation
on self-interest that mimics a moral sense) is not to say that
man is inherently virtuous or altruistic.  If men were angels,
the loss of family would exact no price.

<p>

<center><h3>A Revival of Community</h3></center>

<p>

It is also true, however, that strong families require strong
communities.  Charles Murray explains that &quot;[a]ffiliation
is a means whereby people of common values are enabled to enact
those values.&quot;[14] A functioning community that promotes a wide
array of affiliations provides an extremely important venue both
for practicing virtue and for passing down to the next generation
the habit of virtue.  The passing of values from parent to child,
in fact, presupposes outlets for practice because it involves
-- as Murray puts it -- a &quot;reality test.&quot;

<p><blockquote>

<i>

How does one bequeath a habit of helping others, of giving, of
generosity, if this has not been a part of one's own life? . . . 
Watching parents support compassionate politicians just isn't
the same. . . .  If parents are engaged in directly paying other
people in the community -- supporting local institutions -- they
at least must do such things as choose whom they will pay and
how much.  And even these actions provide a richer basis for instruction
than signing a 1040 Form and then trying to explain compassion
to the child in the abstract.[15]

Wilson's empirical findings concur: generous children are
in fact the sons and daughters of generous parents.  He also discovers,
however, that human sympathy is fragile.  Behavior depends, not
only on the development of right instinct, but on the extent to
which the circumstances create a sense of personal responsibility.
Adam Smith devised a famous thought experiment to demonstrate
the point:  If a man were to learn of the destruction of 100 million
Chinese, he might lament their passing, but in a moment would
return placidly to his business or leisure.  But we would recoil
at the thought of a man who in order to save the loss of his little
finger would will the death of the very same number of distant
Chinese. &quot;If our sentiments were directed simply by our
love of humanity,&quot; Wilson observes, &quot;we might feel equal
anguish at both tragedies, but we do not.&quot;[16] Adam Smith provides
the explanation:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

When the happiness or misery of others depends in any respect
upon our conduct, we dare not, as self-love might suggest to us,
prefer the interest of one to that of many.  The man within 
immediately calls.[17]

</i>

</blockquote><p>

Conversely, when the happiness or misery of others bears no relation
to our conduct, the man within remains silent.

<p>

Given the evidence that there is a &quot;man within,&quot;
the more appropriate question is -- not whether human beings are
capable of strong community -- but why do we not see more evidence
of community already in play.[18] The answer reflects Adam Smith's
insight about human nature, for civil institutions by definition
are groupings of flesh-and-blood men.  To the extent that the
welfare state has eliminated the necessity of a father who provides,
it has reduced the sense of personal responsibility that kept
him at home through good times and bad.  To the extent that Washington
hires social workers to do the job instead, Sioux City will almost
certainly experience a decline in the numbers of men and women
who feel compelled to volunteer their time at the end of a long
day.  In the words of Nathan Glazer, the reason social policy
weakens civil institutions is

<p><blockquote>

<i>

the simple reality that every piece of social policy substitutes
for some traditional arrangement, whether good or bad, a new arrangement
in which public authorities take over, at least in part, the role
of the family, of the ethnic and neighborhood group, of the voluntary
associations.[19]

</i>

</blockquote><p>

In Marvin Olasky's turn of phrase, bad charity drives out good.

<p>

<center><h3>A Revival of Faith</h3></center>

<p>

When families no longer have the benefit of strong communities
-- and many children no longer even have the benefit of family
-- reviving civil society is admittedly more complex than merely
relimiting the size of the welfare state.  Pulling out the knife,
as Professor DiIulio says, is unlikely to resuscitate the dying
man.[20] But neither will a fresh stab wound do the trick.  Civil
society must derive its strength from non-political sources, and
in all probability those sources must spring from a revival of
religious faith.  Relimiting government is essential precisely
because government can stultify, but never revivify, religion.

When public order is lost and the center does not hold, fidelity
to truth demands at least weighing the evidence that faith-based
drug addiction programs save more lives than their secular counterparts.[21]
Short of rigorous empirical calculations, fidelity to the truth
demands engaging in a simple thought experiment:  &quot;If you
are walking down the street in urban America and see four formidable-looking
young males approaching, would you relax a little if you knew
they had just emerged from a Bible study?&quot;  Probably, yes.
The federal government's own surveys of the professional literature
confirm that attachment to church is inversely related to violence.[22]
Given the scale of the current crisis and the clarity of the
evidence in defense of faith, many secular authorities are willing
to give religion its due.  The danger is not simply that government
will soften its bias against faith-based programs too late, but
that government dollars will disarm the very emphasis on faith
that made those programs a success in the first place.

<p>

Government contracting with community-based institutions,
including religious institutions, will almost certainly result
in a more efficient and effective delivery of services.  The issue
at hand, however, is neither efficiency nor material quality.
The issue is transforming lives ravaged, not by a lack of material
resources, but by a lack of the spiritual and moral fiber necessary
to sustain independence.  In a comprehensive study of religious
charities, Amy Sherman concludes:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

The most effective groups challenge those who embrace faith to
live out its moral implications in every significant area of their
lives, from breaking drug addictions and repairing family relationships
to recommitting themselves to the value of honest work.  But state
social-service contracts aren't necessarily concerned with such
outcomes; they focus on meals served, beds available, and checks
cashed.[23]

</i>

</blockquote><p>

Faith-based programs, like men, cannot serve both God and mammon
too.

<p>

Even programs that retain their original vision are likely
to face burdensome regulations that dilute the emphasis on faith.
In explaining why faith-based programs succeed when state-licensed
versions fail, Ed MacClellan, executive director of the Florida
Association of Christian Child Caring Agencies (FACCCA) summarizes
his experience in plain, unvarnished English:  &quot;'In the licensed
homes you'll find Jesus, but you'll have to look for him.  He's
put away in the chapel or in a closet. . . .   Go to one of our
homes, and Jesus is gonna open the front door. That's the 
difference.'&quot;[24] Regardless of right or wrong, the fact is that 
Jesus is unlikely to be opening the door at a public housing project any 
time soon. Faith-minded policymakers must accept that limitation for the
present, and plan accordingly.

<p>

While the loss of a programmatic emphasis on religion is
the most obvious compromise, government funding also changes the
quality of personal relationships in subtle ways that can undercut
any remaining vestiges of faith.  Government paperwork diverts
time from the face-to-face ministry that is the single most important
corrective to the bureaucratic model -- and the most likely avenue
to spiritual renewal.  Quite often the very thing needed, says
Virgil Gulker, founder of Kids/Hope/USA, is simply &quot;a person
who cares, befriending another person who is lonely.&quot;[25] Star
Parker, former welfare recipient, says from personal experience
that the question posed to welfare recipients must be: &quot;God
or government?&quot;[26] But government money damages the credibility
of the personal example individual volunteers can set for the
beneficiaries of their programs.  Reverend Eddie Edwards, who
oversees a community-development organization in east Detroit
called Joy of Jesus, explains: &quot;When we are working with
people in the community, helping them become self-sufficient,
helping them get off welfare, it would be extremely difficult
to tell them to get off welfare if we were on some kind of public
assistance.&quot;[27] Indeed, the most powerful witness men and women
of faith can offer is that dependence on God obviates the need
for dependence on the state.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

As long as state funding remains a part of the landscape,
the church may do good works, but it will fail to realize its
full potential as the vital center of community life.  The heart
of Charles Murray's argument about the prospects for a rebirth
of civil society must be applied with particular urgency to the
institution that is charged with remoralizing civil society.
&quot;The church will be a satisfying institution of community
life (not just religious life) to the extent that the members
have something important to do&quot; -- that will not otherwise
be done.  But &quot;that institutional role will atrophy to the
extent that it does not.&quot;[28] Just as it will be impossible
to secure the benefits of community on the cheap, it will prove
impossible to restore the influence of faith in America without
churchgoers paying a rather steep price to vindicate that faith
in their own lives, day by day.

<p>

Lest the burden seem too overwhelming, Virgil Gulker places
the problem in perspective:  &quot;Somehow the statistics cover
up the fact that behind every number is a name and a face -- a
real person with a real need.  Categories and percentages seem
beyond our grasp, but individuals can be helped.&quot;[29] Faith
believes that the power of just one changed life is in fact more
powerful than an activist state.

<p>

Ultimately, collectivism itself is at war with faith; for,
it is a vision not of individuals finding love and renewal in
the presence of God, but of godlike individuals contriving the
salvation of the masses.  To vindicate the exaltation of an elite
-- often in the face of demonstrated failures to deliver the promised
goods -- collectivism insists upon an abstraction called &quot;society&quot;
to which all moral problems finally refer.  By absolving individuals
of personal responsibility, collectivism enervates the faith that
springs from man's reckoning with his own inadequacy.  But it
also leaves real, flesh-and-blood individuals hurting, by decreasing
the likelihood that men will stir themselves to serve each other
at the deepest point of need.  As Mr. Goodman lamented of Mr.
Fantom, &quot;Between the great thing [man] cannot do, and the
little one that he will not do, life passes, and nothing will
be done.&quot;

<center><h3>What Can Be Done?</h3></center>

<p>

In short, a myriad of the &quot;little things&quot; that
together will equal more than the sum of the parts.  In 1976,
Dr. Virgil Gulker founded an organization called Love, Inc. that
seeks to bridge the gap between needy individuals and suburban
church members.  Someone once observed that Love, Inc. is distinctive
because it has no heroes.  Its sole purpose is to mobilize ordinary
individuals to serve the poor, by making the needs both specific
and manageable and by providing the appropriate training for volunteers.
Today, some 4,000 churches nationwide are involved in Love, Inc.,
while other individuals like Reverend Ronald Moore in Jackson,
Mississippi are developing their own training curriculum to help
mobilize a critical mass of churches.

Dr. Gulker, for his part, has launched a new venture called
Kids/Hope/USA that links adult volunteers in one-to-one relationships
with at-risk children.  Echoing Wilson's empirical findings, Dr.
Gulker speaks from experience: &quot;[When] suffering people remain
nameless and faceless, a mass 'out there' who do not activate
our sense of personal responsibility, . . . [w]hen we lack direct
contact with people's pain, their needs become merely one item
on our agenda -- and not necessarily an important item. . . .
Thus ministry shaped by distance . . . is fatal to those in need.&quot;[30]
Ministry to individuals one by one, on the other hand, is life-giving.
Americans have grown too accustomed to sweeping government action,
aimed at amorphous collective masses.  We must learn to see social
problems as individual responsibilities, but first we must affix
names and faces to the need.

<p>

Secondly, we must find ways to divert economic resources
from failed government programs to successful private-sector initiatives.
But a word of caution at the outset.

<p>

Welfare state advocates often defend bureaucratic programs
by arguing that the private sector cannot possibly replicate existing
levels of government spending.  &quot;Based on the current welfare
model,&quot; Father Robert Sirico replies, &quot;they are right.
All levels of government spend $950 billion a year on welfare
programs.  Charities, excluding churches, spend less than half
this sum (about $360 billion).  Private efforts clearly cannot
assume the functions of the present welfare state.  But why should
they?  An annual welfare budget of $300 billion is roughly three
times the amount of money it would take to raise the incomes of
all poor people above the poverty line.&quot;[31]

The welfare delivery system, like any other bureaucracy-laden
government monopoly, is woefully inefficient.  One study found
that less than 35 cents out of every welfare dollar was paid in
cash directly to the needy.[32] And every year, welfare consumes
more tax dollars without any incentives to cut costs or monitor
results.  In the words of Indianapolis Mayor Steve Goldsmith,
&quot;The federal government offers the best deal in town:  The
more you spend, the more you get. Don't worry about results.&quot;[33]
The national average spending for government-subsidized homeless
shelters is $22 per person per day.  By contrast, Sister Connie
Driscoll operates St. Martin de Porres House of Hope, a homeless
shelter in Chicago, at an average cost of $6.73 per person per
day.  Sister Connie receives no government funding.  But she does
get results.  The House of Hope has the most impressive success
rate in Chicago.  Only 6 percent of its residents find themselves
on the street again.

<p>

The key to success, of course, is that Sister Connie sets
behavioral standards for the receipt of assistance.  The changes
in behavior pose savings over and above the dollars saved by a
more efficient delivery of goods and services.  In a monograph
entitled &quot;The Market Foundations of Philanthropy,&quot; Richard
McKenzie explains:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

The donors' demands for reforms on the part of recipients carry
weight for a simple reason:  the recipients understand that the
private aid can be withdrawn (without an act of Congress), which
means that private aid is much more likely to be performance-based
and cost-effective.[34]

</i>

</blockquote><p>

Just as government bureaucrats treat the agency budget as
a proxy goal to be maximized, recipients of open-ended checks
face their own perverse incentives to perpetuate the very behavior
that drains the tax dollars of millions of hard-working Americans
year after year.  The tax burden in turn undermines the economic
expansiveness that could create jobs -- and fund additional philanthropic
giving.[35]

<p>

Just as the private sector need not replace the welfare state
dollar for dollar, efforts to build private sector capacity do
not depend on an increase in charitable giving by every American.
Only a reasonable percentage of the population must participate.
And voluntary giving is certainly an attractive alternative to
taxation.  Far from serving as an efficient way to raise money
for public purposes, taxation hurts the economy by creating a
disincentive effect for production as well as a new layer of compliance
costs.  Both costs disappear under a voluntary system.  Until
the twentieth-century love affair with government, James Payne
notes in <I>The Public Interest</I>, logic dictated that voluntarism
was the &quot;principal way money was raised for social purposes.&quot;[36]

<p>

Despite the growing bite of government taxation, recent levels
of charitable giving remain impressive.  If the value of volunteer
labor is included, the current value of private charity exceeds
all government welfare spending combined.[37] Payne concludes:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

[Academic preoccupation with the free-rider problem] overlooks
the complexity of human behavior.  Human beings can be generous
as well as selfish, and this generosity makes possible the hundreds
of thousands of voluntary giving arrangements that we see all
across the country. . . . The moral power of this kind of voluntary
transaction can never be achieved with a tax system based on force.
. . .  It is worth speculating how such giving might thrive in
a society that decided to emphasize it, in a society where children
were taught, from their earliest days, that voluntary giving is
needed to sustain civilization.[38]

</i>

</blockquote><p>

Charitable activity does appear to correlate closely with
a coherent system of beliefs.  <I>The American Enterprise</I>
reports that government-shrinking conservatives are more than
twice as likely to volunteer time and likely to give more than
twice as big a percentage of their annual incomes to charity.
The most generous subgroup within the population is religious
conservatives.[39]

</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Research shows, moreover, that giving patterns among individual
Americans have changed along with changes in the role of government.
From the early 1940s through 1964, as the U.S. grew wealthier,
an increasing portion of wealth was given to charities.  In the
mid-1960s, however, the trend was reversed -- despite the fact
that total wealth continued to increase.  A rise in charitable
giving did not reappear until 1981 (during a period of hard times,
incidentally) when the Reagan Administration proposed cuts in
social welfare spending and urged a return to voluntarism.[40] Richard
McKenzie has demonstrated that, as a result, charitable giving
by Americans in the 1980s increased by all possible measures,[41]
while voluntarism made a resurgence among both college students
and professionals.  In 1979, about 300 companies had programs
to encourage workers to participate in community service projects.
By the late 1980s, the number had increased to 600, and at least
200 companies were sending workers into the community on company
time.  Between 1984 and 1989, the number of Americans reporting
charitable volunteer work in Gallup polls rose from 34 percent
to 50 percent.[42]

<p>

Anecdotal evidence from more recent experiments also indicates
that private giving increases in response to cuts in public funding.
In reaction to a Wisconsin Supreme Court injunction against Milwaukee's
newly-expanded school-choice program, which allows parents to
use vouchers at private sectarian schools, residents throughout
the state donated more than $1.2 million to help children stay
in the schools of their choice.[43] And the Public Broadcasting Service
reports a 12 percent increase in private giving over last year.
Federal funds for PBS are scheduled to decrease 6 percent in
1996 and more in 1997.  According to Stu Kantor, PBS associate
director of corporate information, &quot;I think people have been
responding to reports in the news about budgetary pressures facing
PBS.&quot;[44]

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

A number of technical analyses confirm, conversely, that
government spending crowds out private philanthropy.  Russell
Roberts, for example, concluded succinctly in the <I>Journal of
Political Economy</I>:  &quot;Current data and evidence from the
Depression yield support for the crowding-out result.  The huge
growth in public transfers in the 1930s crowded out private antipoverty
efforts and fundamentally changed the nature of private charity.
Current data also support this conclusion.&quot;[45] The explanation
rests on a simple truth about human nature:  People tend to defer
responsibility when someone else will answer the bell.  Charles
Murray captures the problem with characteristic genius:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

At the microlevel, the dialogue between the government and the
citizen goes roughly like this:

<p>

Do you want to go out and feed the hungry or are you going to
sit here and watch television?

<p>

I'm tired.  What'll happen if I don't go?

<p>

Well, if you don't go I guess I'll just have to do it myself.

<p>

In that case, you go.[46]

</i>

</blockquote><p>

By rewriting the dialogue between citizen and government,
cuts in government spending alone are likely to trigger increases
in voluntary giving.  At the very least, taxpayers should be allowed
to shift a percentage of their personal income tax payments from
public programs to private charities.  Several legislators have
already proposed a dollar-for-dollar tax credit for contributions
to charities engaged in poverty-fighting efforts (defined by the
income level of the service recipients).  Ideally, taxpayers would
be allowed to divert up to 41 percent of their personal income
tax payments -- that is, the share of total individual income
taxes that currently goes to federal means-tested welfare programs.[47]
For each tax dollar allocated to private sector charity, public
sector charity would be reduced by a dollar.  Thus, with the credit,
private organizations would at last be able to compete on a level
playing field for welfare tax dollars.  And taxpayers would have
the opportunity to indicate their preference: more government
bureaucracy or individuals helping individuals down the street?

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<font size=+1><b><i>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The dollars sent to poverty-fighting organizations would
not undermine giving to museums and symphony orchestras because
money donated to cultural institutions would still be tax deductible.
At present, the tax code permits charitable deductions from taxable
income -- not from the check owed the I.R.S.  Thus, under the
current system, donors in higher tax brackets benefit more from
charitable giving.  Congress should consider elevating the charitable
deduction to 120 percent, but also restoring the deduction to
non-itemizers.

<p>

Approximately seven out of 10 taxpayers opt for the standard
deduction -- even when they have donated a substantial amount
-- usually because they have no mortgage interest deduction.
An above-the-line deduction for charitable contributions for non-itemizing
taxpayers would not only benefit many middle-to-low-income people,
but is also likely to increase charitable giving to an array of
neighborhood organizations involved in poverty prevention efforts.
During 1985-1986, when a charitable deduction for non-itemizers
was last in place, charitable giving among non-itemizers did in
fact rise dramatically.  And tax provisions that empower <I>everyone</I>, 
not just people of means, are precisely the reforms most likely
to benefit the health clinics and mentoring programs in low-and
middle-income neighborhoods.  Surveys show that people who make
the least are inclined to give the highest percentage of their
income to help neighbors in need.[48]

<p>

While block grants simply reallocate power among public bureaucracies,
tax breaks for giving restore power to individual citizens and
communities -- power that in turn will fuel the ethic of caring
that is the true hallmark of freedom.  In <I>Prospects for Conservatives</I>, 
Russell Kirk wrote:  &quot;The enlightened conservative .
. . knows that the just and ordered society is that in which Love
governs us, so far as Love ever can reign in this world of sorrows;
and he knows that the anarchical or the tyrannical society is
that in which Love lies corrupt.&quot;[49]

Love lies corrupted today by a welfare state that asks men
to love not individuals, but faceless collectivities.  If Kirk
is correct that men are &quot;put into this world . . . to aspire
toward the triumph of Love,&quot;[50] then we must aspire toward the
end of a system that thrusts our benevolence out to the remotest
periphery, to people whose names and faces we do not know and
whose hands we cannot hold.  Life for them will not be whole again
until we learn to love, one heart at a time.

<h2>THE LAST WORD</h2>

<p><hr width=60% noshade><p>

<h2>My Favorite Volunteer</h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>I</font>n all the years of working with church members, 
my favorite volunteer is a woman in her mid-sixties.  For a long time, 
whenever I would speak with her, she would talk about friends who had 
died and about her arthritis.

<p>

She also talked wistfully about a great disappointment in
her life.  As a girl she had set her goal to become a teacher.
But she came from a poor family, and after the eighth grade she
was required to go out to work to help support her family.  Later
she married, and then she sometimes had to work outside the home
to supplement her husband's earnings and sometimes stayed at home
and cared for her four children.  She never regretted any of this,
but she wondered what might have been.

<p>

I approached this woman one day and said that we needed tutors
for Hispanic and Oriental children.  &quot;Will you tutor?&quot;
I asked.  In effect, I was asking, Will you become the teacher
you always wanted to be?

<p>

&quot;I can't,&quot; she replied.  &quot;I'm too old.&quot;

<p>

&quot;You're not too old,&quot;  I replied.

<p>

&quot;I don't have the skills,&quot; she objected.

<p>

&quot;I'll train you,&quot; I said.

<p>

She finally agreed to go through the training program --
probably to get me off her back.  But she told me she wasn't planning
to tutor; she would just help in other ways.  &quot;Fine,&quot;
I said.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
It is hard to imagine<br>
that anyone anywhere<br>
was happier that night.<br>
She had become the teacher<br>
she had wanted to be.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

At the end of the training, I asked her to tutor two Hispanic
boys. She gave in.

<p>

In subsequent months, when I saw her, I would ask, &quot;How
is your arthritis?&quot;

<p>

&quot;What?&quot; she would say.  Instead, she would tell
me about the boys.

<p>

&quot;Have you been reading the obituaries lately?&quot;
I would ask.

<p>

&quot;No,&quot; she would answer, and then tell me about
the problems the boys were having.  The boys became her life.

<p>

A week before Christmas she was sitting in her living room,
and she heard a terrible commotion outside.  When she opened the
front door, there stood the two boys in the snow.  They had brought
all their classmates to sing Christmas carols to their &quot;favorite
teacher.&quot;

<p>

It is hard to imagine that anyone anywhere was happier that
night.  She had become the teacher she had wanted to be.

<p>

I often think that this woman, who is my mother, is like
many other people:  all reticence and excuses, but when they get
the right opportunity, the training and the encouragement, they
succeed.

<title>STATUTORY RAPE: THE DIRTY SECRET BEHIND TEEN SEX NUMBERS</title>

<h1>Statutory Rape:</h1>
<h2><i>The Dirty Secret Behind Teen Sex Numbers</i></h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>C</font>ontrary to the common perception that teenage sex 
and pregnancy typically stem from two teenagers getting caught up in the 
heat of the moment, new research reveals that many teenage girls are
being sexually exploited and impregnated by adult men.

<p>

In fact, a recent study published in the <I>American Journal of
Public Health</I> found that adult men fathered two-thirds of
the infants born to school-aged mothers in California in 1993.
On average, these men were 4.2 years older than the senior-high
mothers and 6.7 years older than the junior-high mothers.[1]

<p>

Likewise, a review of California's 1990 vital statistics found
that men older than high school age sired 77 percent of all births
to high school-aged girls (ages 16-18) and 51 percent of births
to junior high school-aged girls (15 and younger). Men over age
25 fathered twice as many teenage births as did boys under age
18, and men over age 20 fathered five times more births to junior
high school-aged girls than did junior high school-aged boys.[2]

<p>

Unfortunately, this phenomenon is not limited to the state of
California. A recent study by the Population Reference Bureau
found that about two-thirds of births to teenage girls nationwide
are fathered by adult men age 20 or older.[3] Additionally, the Alan
Guttmacher Institute's 1994 report, &quot;Sex and America's Teenagers,&quot;
found that six of 10 girls who had sex before age 15 were coerced
by males an average of six years their senior.[4] The Urban Institute
cites a study showing that &quot;three quarters of females who
had sexual intercourse before age 14 reported having had sex 
involuntarily.&quot;[5]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

That our culture at large has been slow to recognize this phenomenon
is not surprising. At one time, the picture of teenage pregnancy
did look vastly different than it does today. In 1970, seven of
10 teen births were within marriage. Today, the opposite is true
-- seven of 10 teen births are out-of-wedlock[6] . . . and many are
the results of statutory rape and victimization.

<p>

In many respects, the rise in statutory rape is the tragic and
predictable consequence of the larger moral free-for-all that
began during the sexual revolution of the 1960s and 1970s. As
sex was severed from the context of marriage and perceived barriers
to personal &quot;freedom&quot; were torn down, the door was opened
to a &quot;liberation&quot; in which predators were given easier
access to the most vulnerable in our society.

<p>

<center><h3>Family Breakdown: Fatherlessness and Child Abuse</h3></center>

<p>

At the heart of this problem, as with most social pathologies,
is the breakdown of the intact two-parent family unit.

<p>

Over the last 25 years, the change in family patterns has been
dramatic. It used to be that the man in every girl's life was
her father. He was her protector and provider, shielding her honor
and ensuring her safety. But between 1970 and 1995, the share
of married-couple families with dependent children dropped by
one-third, while the proportion of single-parent families nearly
doubled. In 1995, 18.9 million children lived with only one parent,
compared with 8.2 million in 1970. Today, the large number of
single-parent families are increasingly due to illegitimacy rather
than divorce.[7]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Fatherlessness is associated<br>
with increased risk of child<br>
sexual abuse.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Consequently, fewer fathers are around to protect and defend their
daughters' safety. And with more girls lacking the love and attention
that only a father can give, more of them are vulnerable to abuse,
and that abuse leaves them willing to settle for perverse alternatives,
namely, seeking intimacy with predatory adult men.

<p>

The research is clear: fatherlessness is associated with increased
risk of child sexual abuse.

<p>

For example, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services'
<I>National Health Interview Survey</I> (1988) found that children
from disrupted families are at a much higher risk for physical
or sexual abuse than children from intact, two-parent families.[8]

<p>

A 1993 study in the <I>British Journal of Psychiatry</I> found
that childhood sexual abuse occurred more frequently in women
from disadvantaged and difficult family backgrounds, and that
their risks of becoming a victim were increased if they came from
a broken home.[9]

<p>

Furthermore, children whose parents separate are significantly
more likely to engage in early sexual activity than their peers
from intact, two-parent families, according to a 1994 study in
<I>Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent 
Psychiatry</I>.[10]

<p>

Dr. George Rekers of the University of South Carolina School of
Medicine found that compared with girls in intact nuclear families,
girls who lost their fathers through divorce were overly responsive
to males, more likely to be sexually involved with males in adolescence,
and more often pregnant before marriage.[11]

<p>

David Murray, a social anthropologist, explains the effects of
illegitimacy on girls this way: &quot;For the girls, at earliest
nubility comes predation by older males, undeterred by a resident
father who would protect her honor and her safety.&quot;[12]

<p>

One might mistakenly presume that the presence of a male figure,
besides the father, would help alleviate the situation. But in
fact, when illegitimacy or divorce results in a subsequent marriage,
remarriage, or cohabiting relationship, the likelihood of child
abuse increases.

<p>

According to a study by the Canadian researchers Martin Daly and
Margo Wilson, preschool children in stepfamilies are 40 times
as likely as children in intact families to suffer physical or
sexual abuse.[13]

<p>

Additionally, a 1994 study in the <i>Journal of Comparative Family
Studies</i> found that, out of 52,000 child abuse cases, 72 percent
involved children living in a household without one or both biological
parents, even though such households comprise roughly a third
of all households with children.[14]

<p>

Not only is fatherlessness associated with child abuse, but abused
children are also more vulnerable to further exploitation, particularly
further sexual exploitation. Kathy Szafran, residential program
director for the Florence Crittenton Homes and Services in West
Virginia, was quoted in <I>The Washington Times</I> as saying,
&quot;It shouldn't be hard to see 'why a child who's been molested
since age 7 is acting out sexually at age 14.'&quot;

<p>

Indeed, research shows that teenage mothers whose babies were
fathered by adult men are disproportionately the childhood victims
of sexual assault by adult men.[15]

<p>

A 1992 Washington state study of 535 adolescent mothers found
that 62 percent of the teenage mothers had had a history of rape
or sexual molestation by men whose ages averaged 27 years.[16] This
study found that, compared with nonabused mothers, abused adolescent
mothers initiated sex earlier, had sex with much older partners,
and engaged in riskier, more frequent, and promiscuous sex.[17]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

In a recent edition of <I>Newsweek</I>, Joe Klein poignantly described
the connection between fatherlessness, child abuse, and subsequent
sexual victimization when he recounted the personal testimony
of a girl whom he called Charlette. &quot;The guy's name was Mickey.
He was older, in his mid-20s. Charlette was going through a bad
time: her stepfather had come home from prison, was beating her
mother, was beating on her. 'I lived in the streets for a while,
starting when I was 14,' she said. 'I was young and vulnerable.
I had problems. He was going to protect me, teach me things, discipline
my mind. But when I told him I was pregnant, he was gone. I began
to ask around.... I found he had six other children, mostly with
younger girls. I was naive, and he took advantage of me.&quot;
Joe Klein later remarked, &quot;As for the girls, who are inevitably
fatherless, Charlette's yearning for protection -- for a <I>father</I>
-- seems entirely comprehensible.&quot;[18]

<p>

Fatherlessness, however, not only creates the environment for
more vulnerable girls, it also helps create more predatory males.
Research shows that boys who grow up without fathers are far more
likely to engage in violent behavior and promiscuity than those
who grow up in two-parent homes.

<p>

According to a 1990 article by Nicholas Davidson in <I>Policy
Review</I>, 60 percent of America's rapists grew up in homes without
fathers.[19] Furthermore, a research review by Dr. George Rekers of
the University of South Carolina School of Medicine found that
the fatherless boys exhibit greater aggressiveness or exaggerated
masculine behavior.[20]

<p>

It is also important to note that many of these predatory adult
men may have originated from fatherless families in which they,
too, had been abused.

<p>

<center><h3>Family Breakdown: The Lack of Parental Supervision</h3></center>

<p>

Ensuring that children receive adequate parental supervision is
already a difficult task in today's two-parent homes because the
financial constraints of modern-day life make it increasingly
difficult for one parent to stay at home full-time. But when parents
face single-parenthood because of divorce or illegitimacy, the
difficulties of supervising their children are compounded.

<p>

Research shows that teenagers who are subject to less adult supervision
are more likely to engage in sexual activity. This association
applies not only to homes which lack parental supervision during
the day, but also to neighborhoods in which a high percentage
of the adult labor force works full-time. This effect suggests
that teenagers who are less closely supervised have more opportunity
to engage in sexual behavior.

<p>

While the amount of parental and/or adult supervision that a teenager
receives during the day is difficult to measure, researchers have
often used maternal employment as a proxy for adult supervision
since much teen sexual activity today takes place after school
in the homes of &quot;latchkey&quot; children.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
The effect of maternal<br>
employment on early<br>
intercourse is greater<br>
for teens with mothers<br>
employed full-time than<br>
for adolescents with<br>
mothers employed part-<br>
time.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

For example, a 1993 study published in <I>Public Health Reports</I>
found that young males who have mothers that work full-time are
significantly more likely (by 89 percent in blacks and 26 percent
in nonblacks) to have initiated intercourse than are boys with
non-employed mothers. Young black males who have mothers that
work for pay part-time are 56 percent more likely to have started
having intercourse than are those whose mothers are not employed.[21]

<p>

The same study also found that the effect of maternal employment
on early intercourse is greater for teens with mothers employed
full-time than for adolescents with mothers employed part-time.
Compared with non-employed mothers, part-time work is associated
with a 26 percent increase in early intercourse and full-time
work is associated with a 45 percent increase.[22]

<p>

Furthermore, a 1994 study in the <I>Journal of Marriage and the
Family</I> reported that white females whose mothers are employed
outside the home are more likely to have had intercourse than
females whose mothers are not employed.[23]

<p>

This same study also found that the percentage of female labor
force participants who are employed full-time in a given neighborhood
is associated with an increased likelihood of premarital sexual
activity among young women in the neighborhood. This effect, which
is consistent in both black and white female teenagers,[24] suggests
that the deterrent effect of having a parent in the home may be
undermined somewhat if the girl's boyfriend goes home to an empty
house after school.

<p>

Additionally, a 1994 study published in the <I>Journal of Adolescent
Health</I> found that white teenage girls whose mothers work for
pay full-time outside the home are more likely to lead promiscuous
lives as adults (have multiple partners) than girls whose mothers
do not work for pay full-time.[25]

<p>

<center><h3>Erosion of Cultural Protections</h3></center>

<p>

While absent fathers figure prominently in this new phenomenon
of child abuse, they are not solely to blame for the devastation.
Cultural influences such as the media and schools have also failed
to protect children.

<p>

Television and movies regularly expose children to sexually explicit
images, glamorizing sex and violence. While the instances of this
type of cultural pollution are too numerous to count, one particular
example should be noted here. A recent (March 1996) episode of
the television prime time drama,<I> Chicago Hope</I>, featured
a storyline in which a 14-year-old girl was having sex with an
adult man. The drama explored both viewpoints about why it was
either permissible or impermissible for the young girl to be having
sex with an adult man, but in the end, the show condoned their
sexual relations because they were &quot;in love.&quot;

<p>

In addition to the media, schools have now taken up the mantle
of exposing children to sexually explicit information -- this
time, in the guise of &quot;sex education.&quot; Many school administrators
have mistakenly concluded that the way to &quot;prevent&quot;
the problem of teen pregnancy is to expose children at progressively
younger and younger ages to more explicit sex education in the
school, so that children can learn how to protect themselves with
condoms, etc. But this scenario is a textbook case in which the
&quot;cure&quot; is far worse than the disease.

<p>

The results of the National Survey of Adolescent Males published
in the November 1993 issue of <I>Public Health Reports</I> show
that young males who were taught about birth control were more
likely to experiment with sex at an earlier age than if they had
received no (formal) instruction.[26]

<p>

Furthermore, explicit sex education can tear down the natural
inhibitions and defenses of both young boys and girls, leaving
them vulnerable to sexual predators. Indeed, pedophiles often
use pornography to lure their young victims.[27]

<p>

In spite of this, the Sex Information and Education Council of
the United States (SIECUS), a federally-funded, nationally-recognized
organization, has issued national sex education guidelines which
promote teaching kindergartners about masturbation and junior
and senior high school students about the &quot;benefits&quot;
of pornography, among other topics.[28]

<p>

<center><h3>Erosion of Legal Protections</h3></center>

<p>

Declining cultural norms and values also have a detrimental effect
on laws intended to protect children. When the culture condones
particular kinds of illegal behavior, the law loses its authority
to prosecute. This has clearly been the case with statutory rape
laws.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Laws against statutory rape were originally designed to protect
adolescent girls -- typically aged 16 and under -- from sex under
any circumstance, regardless of whether there was &quot;consent.&quot;
These laws were premised on the belief that young girls were too
immature to be having sex and that they could no more give meaningful
consent to sexual activity than they &quot;could consent to work
nights as a stripper in a bar.&quot;[29] But during the sexual revolution
of the 1960s and 1970s, states began to change their laws to reflect
more permissive cultural attitudes.

<p>

First, the age of consent for sexual activity was lowered or altered.
In two states, Hawaii and Pennsylvania, 14 years is the age of
consent. Many other laws were changed to say that having sex with
a young teenage girl was statutory rape, but sex with a girl in
her mid-teens was only considered statutory rape if the male was
three or four years older than she was. In other words, a 15-year-old
girl could have sex with a 15-year-old boy, but not with a 19-year-old
man.[30]

<p>

For example, in Virginia, 18 is the age of consent. However, a
person can only be prosecuted for rape if the victim is under
13 years old. A lesser felony offense can be charged if a person
three or more years older has consensual intercourse with a 13-
or 14-year old, but it is only a misdemeanor if the offender is
less than three years older. It is also considered only a misdemeanor
if a person over 18 has consensual intercourse with a child aged
15 or older.[31]

<p>

In Indiana, where the age of consent is 16, there is no longer
a crime of statutory rape. Instead, the state can charge an adult
with child molestation if the child is under age 14, or with sexual
misconduct if the minor is 14 or 15 years old. However, the sexual
misconduct charge can only be leveled at people 18 years and older.
Thus, a 17-year-old who has sex with a 14-year-old could not be
charged with sexual misconduct.[32]

<p>

Although it may seem absurd that the United States allowed the
age of sexual consent to be lowered at all, the example of Britain's
current exploration on lowering their own age of sexual consent
laws is revealing. Indeed, the arguments being currently used
by British proponents of lowering the age of consent mirror the
arguments that led the United States down this slippery slope.
Consider the comments of Alison Hadley of The Brook Advisory Centres,
which runs 27 National Health Service-funded birth control clinics
for teenagers and young adults in England, Scotland, and Ulster:
&quot;Teenagers under 16 don't automatically put a brake on their
raging hormones and postpone having sex just because it is decreed
in law. The age of consent also presupposes that we all mature
at the same time. We don't. We often see mature girls of 14 as
well as 16-year-olds with plenty of growing still to do. Like
it or not, many 14- and 15-year-olds are having sex.&quot;[33]

<p>

Unfortunately, the United States knows all too well about the
devastating consequences of that perverse logic.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>

</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Second, lax law enforcement of statutory rape crimes have added
fuel to the fire. Few courts have given priority to the prosecution
of adults who have sex with minors, especially because they are
pressed with many other cases of violent delinquency and child
abuse. But prosecutors say that the biggest stumbling block against
bringing a case to court is the girls themselves. Many girls are
reluctant, if not hostile witnesses who either recant or refuse
to testify against their adult &quot;lovers,&quot; the fathers
of their children.[34] The girls may also decline to name the father
if they fear retaliation.[35]

<p>

In addition, parents have not usually understood that they can
seek legal protection through the courts. Parents may ask a juvenile
court judge to declare the girl &quot;ungovernable&quot; and order
her not to see the man. But such cases are low in priorities for
courts, and a court order may not stop stubborn lovers anyway.
If juvenile court sanctions fail, parents can take the next step
and press criminal charges. But police and prosecutors say they're
often hamstrung in these cases, by parents afraid that if the
law gets involved, their daughters will run away, and by lack
of evidence when lovestruck girls refuse to testify.[36]

<p>

Third, the law has not always upheld the rights of parents to
protect their children's innocence. For example, the federal family
planning program -- Title X of the Public Health Service Act --
undermines parental authority in their children's reproductive
health decision-making. Title X is a categorical grant program
which gives federal funds to family planning clinics all around
the country. Title X clinics offer contraceptives, pelvic exams,
pregnancy tests, screening for sexually-transmitted diseases,
and sexual health counseling to minors without parental notification
or consent.[37] However, even though the actual law specifies that
family participation is to be encouraged, the federal policy guidelines
state that clinics receiving Title X support must guarantee patient
confidentiality, and this mandate that has been upheld by the
courts.[38]

<p>

Furthermore, Title X clinics have no provisions regarding the
reporting of suspected cases of statutory rape. In fact, these
clinics may be indirectly aiding and abetting the problem in at
least four ways: (1) the clinic does not involve parents, even
in cases where the child is very young and is admittedly &quot;sexually
active,&quot; (2) the clinic's dispensation of contraceptives
can mask a problem that might otherwise be brought to light, (3)
clinics will see and treat &quot;any woman, regardless of age,&quot;
even when that &quot;woman&quot; is 11 or 12 years old,[39] and (4)
counselors are not trained to look for cases of statutory rape
nor are they required to report any suspected cases of statutory
rape to local law enforcement. That omission is especially horrendous
in light of the current data which show that two-thirds of all
teenage births are fathered by adult men.

<p>

<center><h3>Renew Efforts to Prosecute Statutory Rape</h3></center>

<p>

The most direct way to address the problem of statutory rape is
through the law enforcement system. California Governor Pete Wilson
has cracked down on statutory rapists as part of his state's campaign
against teenage pregnancy. Last summer he allocated $2.4 million
to a pilot program for 16 counties to begin prosecuting men who
engage in sex with underage girls, and in January 1996, he pledged
$6 million more for a statewide crackdown.[40]

<p>

The California State Assembly also recently passed a bill which
would add penalties of up to five years in jail for statutory
rape when a minor becomes pregnant. This penalty can be sought
in addition to civil and/or criminal suits for statutory rape.[41]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
Few courts have given<br>
priority to the prosecution<br>
of adults who have sex<br>
with minors.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

In Florida, state legislators will soon consider a &quot;Teen
Predators Act&quot; which would create a new child abuse felony
in cases where a man older than 21 impregnates a girl under 16.
A conviction would result in mandatory prison time.[42] Another bill
seeking consideration in Florida is nicknamed MAMA, which stands
for &quot;Make Adult Males Accountable.&quot; This bill would
allow some statutory rapists to be prosecuted under child-abuse
laws, which would have the beneficial effect of requiring medical
facilities, day-care centers, and schools to report statutory
rape as they would any other incident of suspected child abuse.[43]

<p>

Efforts must also be made to change the rhetoric and perception
under which minors are viewed as mature decision-makers. For example,
in the Alan Guttmacher Institute's 1994 report, &quot;Sex and
America's Teenagers,&quot; adolescents girls who have been exploited
by adult men are repeatedly referred to as &quot;sexually-experienced
women.&quot;[44] The Alan Guttmacher Institute, Planned Parenthood,
and other proponents of aggressive marketing of contraceptives
and abortions to minor children have consistently refused to use
language that reinforces the need for special protection for teenage
girls and boys -- especially that provided by their families.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<font size=+1><b><i>

and abetting the problem.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The use of &quot;women&quot; in this context serves the purpose
of fostering an egalitarian drive to repeal parental rights statutes,
but masks the emotional and psychological immaturity that makes
sexual activity at this stage of life especially risky.[45]

<p>

Finally, states should seriously consider raising the age of sexual
consent laws to mirror the age of marriage laws. Currently, 16
is the age of sexual consent in most states, but the minimum legal
age of marriage in most states is 18.[46] (A few states have higher
ages for marriage, but no state's marriage law is below the age
of 18, except with parental consent.) This action would not only
allow states to legally prosecute the statutory rape cases which
occur during the later teen years (ages 16-17), but it would also
help to relink sex to its proper context within marriage.

<p>

<center><h3>Strengthen the Family</h3></center>

<p>

While public policy can directly address the problem of statutory
rape through legislative means, its ability to impact the root
cause of statutory rape -- family breakdown -- is only indirect
at best. After all, the law cannot -- and should not -- dictate
to families how to raise their children, but the law can and should
encourage behaviors which help strengthen the family through the
use of incentives and disincentives.

<p>

For example, in order to discourage illegitimacy, public policy
makers have sought to implement a &quot;family cap,&quot; a measure
which would halt additional welfare payments to mothers who bear
further illegitimate children while on welfare. Public policy
makers have also sought to overturn no-fault divorce laws and/or
elevate marriage from a &quot;contract&quot; to a &quot;covenant&quot;
relationship in order to support the permanency of marriage. Furthermore,
laws which provide tax relief for families as well as policies
which provide employees with more flexible work hours and/or work-at-home
arrangements may help to increase parental supervision of children.

<p>

While the aforementioned policies are sound and can be very helpful,
they alone cannot break the cycle of illegitimacy and divorce,
especially because the scourges of illegitimacy and divorce are
transferred through generations. That is, children whose parents
are unmarried or divorced are more likely to also one day bear
illegitimate children or have their own marriages end in divorce.[47]
Thus, other non-public policy means of prevention must be encouraged
as well.

One effective method of prevention which should not be overlooked
is the impact of religion. Indeed, a large body of research shows
that religiously committed individuals are less likely to divorce
or separate from one's spouse.[48] Teenagers with high personal religiosity
are also less likely to engage in premarital sex or cohabit.[49] Another
study found that adolescent males who went to church more often
at age 14 were less likely to have early intercourse.[50]

<center><h3>Conclusion</h3></center>

<p>

The current trend of adult men impregnating teenage girls is a
natural consequence of family breakdown and its subsequent effects
on culture and the law. But what children need now is what they
have always needed -- for adults to protect their innocence. They
need fathers and mothers who will love and supervise them, laws
that punish statutory rapists, and a culture which values and
upholds the sacredness of marital sex, the permanency of marriage,
and the authority of parents.

<title>PARENTAL RIGHTS: WHO DECIDES HOW CHILDREN ARE RAISED?</title>

<body>

<center>

<h1>Parental Rights:</h1>
<h2><i>Who Decides How Children Are Raised?</i></h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>F</font>rom ancient times to modernity, political philosophy 
has grappled with the sensitive relationship between the child, family, 
and state.  In <I>The Republic</I>, Plato wrote:

<p><blockquote>

<i>&quot;The wives of our guardians are to be common, and their
children are to be common, and no parent is to know his own child,
nor any child his parent. . . .  The proper officers will take
the offspring of the good parents to the pen or fold, and there
they will deposit them with certain nurses who dwell in a separate
quarter.&quot;</i>

</blockquote><p>

In <I>Orthodoxy</I>, G.K. Chesterton observed:

<p><blockquote>

<i>&quot;In short, the democratic faith is this:  that the
most terribly important things must be left to ordinary men themselves
-- the mating of the sexes, the rearing of the young, the laws
of the state.&quot;</i>

</blockquote><p>

Like Plato, modern-day utopian thinkers and totalitarian
states have always looked upon the parent-child relationship with
suspicion at best, and more often as the crucial obstacle to ultimate
state power over the individual.  For even if the state is successful
in dissolving all other institutions which mediate between the
individual and state, such as local government, the church, and
private associations, it must still contend with the family unit
as the last bastion of organic relationships from which spring
an individual's prior loyalties.  Because a totalitarian regime
can admit of no prior loyalties, ultimately the natural bonds
between husband and wife, and parent and child must also be dissolved,
reducing even children to the status of atomized individuals,
helpless before the Leviathan.

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Conversely, as Chesterton so eloquently expressed, respect
for the autonomy of the family is as central to the democratic
ideal as popular sovereignty.  The democratic experiment is founded
on an optimism in the ability of the people to manage their own
affairs, in their capacity as citizens with authority over &quot;the
laws of the state,&quot; and in their capacity as parents with
authority over &quot;the rearing of the young.&quot;  Therefore,
restoring parental rights to its original firm foundation in U.S.
constitutional law is crucial to our overall efforts to reinvigorate
the democratic ideal of citizenship.

<p>

<center><h3>The Constitutional Roots of Parental Rights</h3></center>

<p>

Parental liberty as a fundamental right found a secure place
in U.S. constitutional jurisprudence beginning with two Supreme
Court cases from the 1920s.  The 1923 decision in <I>Meyer v.
Nebraska</I>[1] involved a challenge to a Nebraska state law which
prohibited the teaching of foreign languages in any school --
public or private -- prior to the eighth grade.  In determining
whether or not the foreign-language prohibition unreasonably infringed
upon family rights,[2] the Supreme Court declared that the 14th Amendment
liberty interest &quot;[w]ithout doubt, [] denotes not merely
freedom from bodily restraint but also the right of the individual
to contract, to engage in any of the common occupations of life,
to acquire useful knowledge, to marry, establish a home and bring
up children.&quot;[3] The Court held that the Nebraska statute interfered
with the parents' fundamental right to raise their children, including
the right to have their children learn a foreign language.

<font size=+1><b><i>
With the parental<br>
responsibility to protect<br>
their children from harm<br>
comes the parental right<br>
to direct their children's<br>
upbringing and education.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Two years later, in <I>Pierce v. Society of Sisters,</I>[4] the
Court examined an Oregon state statute compelling parents to send
their children to public schools from ages 8 to 16 -- essentially
banning private education.[5]  While acknowledging that the State
has the authority to enact reasonable regulations to ensure the
basic education of the citizenry,[6] the Court held that in this
instance state authority must yield to the rights of parents.
&quot;Under the doctrine of <I>Meyer v. Nebraska</I>, we think
it entirely plain that the [Oregon state] Act of 1922 unreasonably
interferes with the liberty of parents and guardians to direct
the upbringing and education of children under their control&quot;[7]
(citations omitted). The Court stated:

<p><blockquote>

<i>The fundamental theory of liberty upon which all governments
in this Union repose excludes any general power of the State to
standardize its children by forcing them to accept instruction
from public teachers only.  The child is not the mere creature
of the State; those who nurture him and direct his destiny have
the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare
him for additional obligations.</i>[8]

</blockquote><p>

A generation passed before the high court issued another landmark
parental rights decision, <I>Prince v. Massachusetts</I>.[9] The
Court ruled in favor of state authority over the asserted parental
right of Sarah Prince, a Jehovah's Witness.  Prince was the guardian
of a 9-year-old girl whom she took with her to sell religious
pamphlets on the street.  When charged with violating state child
labor laws, Prince claimed that the law violated her religious
freedom and parental rights.  The Court, citing <I>Pierce</I>,
acknowledged parental rights in the strongest terms:

<p><blockquote>

<i>It is cardinal with us that the custody, care and nurture
of the child reside first in the parents, whose primary function
and freedom include preparation for obligations the state can
neither supply nor hinder.  And it is in recognition of this that
these decisions have respected the private realm of family life
which the state cannot enter&quot; (citations omitted).</i>[10]

</blockquote><p>

Despite this reaffirmation, the Court recognized that the state
may act to protect children by &quot;limiting parental freedom
and authority in things affecting the child's welfare&quot;[11] 
including protecting the child from &quot;the crippling effects of 
child employment,&quot; especially in public places.[12]

<p>

In 1972, the Supreme Court again considered a case involving
overlapping issues of parental rights and religious freedom.
In <I>Wisconsin v. Yoder</I>,[13] Amish families desired to remove
their children from school after the eighth grade, violating Wisconsin's
compulsory education law.[14] The Court declared:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Indeed it seems clear that if the State is empowered, as</I> 
parens patriae, <I>to &quot;save&quot; a child from himself
or his Amish parents by requiring an additional two years of compulsory
formal high school education, the State will in large measure
influence, if not determine, the religious future of the child.
Even more markedly than in Prince, therefore, this case involves
the fundamental interest of parents, as contrasted with that of
the State, to guide the religious future and education of their
children.</i>[15]

</blockquote><p>

While recognizing the State's &quot;high responsibility for
education of its citizens,&quot;[16] the Court concluded that this
interest did not outweigh the Amish parents' religious beliefs
and parent liberty interest in directing the education of their
children.[17]

<p>

<center><h3>The Modern Assault on Parental Rights</h3></center>

<p>

The state laws overturned by the high court in <I>Meyer</I>
and <I>Pierce</I> were generated by racial and religious tensions
typical of the 1920s (<I>Meyer</I> dealt with anti-German sentiment
following World War I, and <I>Pierce</I>, the anti-Catholicism
of the age).  Recent conflicts between parents and the state involve
a broad range of matters at the very heart of the parent-child
relationship.  The growing parental backlash against schools and
other government bureaucracies is best understood as part of the
overall struggle parents face as they attempt to transmit their
most cherished beliefs to their children in the midst of an anti-family
culture.

<p>

Many social commentators have focused attention on our degraded
popular culture, and it is widely recognized that parents face
an increasingly difficult task in monitoring their children's
exposure to the barrage of harmful images produced by Hollywood,
pop music, and the Internet.  But while a national debate rages
over the proper response to the polluted commercial marketplace,
relatively little attention has been focused on the fact that
too often parents have discovered that their own <I>government</I>
is part of the problem.  Increasingly, parents are demanding that
government policies support, rather than undermine, their authority.

<p>

The past generation has witnessed the growth of  two overlapping
trends in public policy which have significantly undermined parental
authority and family autonomy.  The first is exemplified by laws
giving minors access to abortion and birth control without parental
approval, and in looming threats like the U.N. Convention on the
Rights of the Child.[18] Implicit in these policies is an assumption
that children should be treated as &quot;short adults,&quot; i.e.,
as autonomous individuals, fully capable of making crucial decisions
about their upbringing, and legally entitled to make these decisions
outside the context of their family.  The second trend involves
the state's increasing propensity to substitute its judgment for
that of parents in matters relating to the upbringing and education
of children.

<p>

These trends run counter to the longstanding philosophical
and legal understanding  that with the parental responsibility
to <I>protect</I> their children from harm comes the parental
right to <I>direct</I> their children's upbringing and education.
But in cases where the state allows minors access to the full
range of choices formerly reserved for adults, parents are effectively
prevented from fulfilling their role as protector.  When the state
substitutes its judgment for that of parents by actually making
the choice for the minor, parental responsibility to guide their
children's choices is usurped.

<p>

<center><h3>'Short Adults'</h3></center>

<p>

Historically, the majority of our laws regulating minors' choices
have been of a protective nature.  For example, adults many not
enter into binding contracts with unemancipated minors, on the
assumption that a child should not be legally bound to fulfill
a contract between parties of such unequal bargaining power and
capacity.  Adults are also prohibited from selling alcohol, tobacco,
and pornography to children.  Abuse laws protect children if the
threat comes from within the family.  The law steps in to protect
the child from being harmed by a more powerful agent.

<p>

While it is indisputable that children have rights, parents
traditionally have been considered the proper custodians of these
rights until their children reach adulthood.  &quot;The presumptions
arising from the limited capacities of children account, in large
part, for their general limitation on the exercise of 'choice'
rights.  The law, and traditionally the culture, has assumed that
a basic capacity to make responsible choices is a prerequisite
to meaningful exercise of such rights.&quot;[19]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
The so-called 'children's<br>
rights' movement threatens<br>
to destroy a child's most<br>
precious right: the right<br>
to childhood innocence.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The 1967 case of <I>In re Gault</I>[20] marked the Supreme Court's
first unequivocal ruling that children have constitutional rights.
While <I>Gault</I> involved juvenile court delinquency proceedings,
the Court's reasoning has far broader implications for the general
liberty of children.  Courts have begun to grant children &quot;choice&quot;
rights like adults in select areas, most notably, by guaranteeing
access to birth control and abortion.[21] This has served as a compelling
precedent for other state policies which prevent parents from
controlling minor's choice rights.

<p>

The movement to grant minors full access to the full range
of choices available to adults naturally leads to liberation of
children from their parents, who serve as an obstacle to the free
exercise of these new rights.  But in a tragic irony, the so-called
&quot;children's rights&quot; movement threatens to destroy a
child's most precious right:  the right to childhood innocence.
A startling example of this phenomenon can be found in local
public libraries.  The American Library Association is formally
opposed to any restrictions on a child's ability to check out
any item, no matter how pornographic or inappropriate for children,
regardless of parental objections.[22] The ALA has gone so far as
to refuse to let parents view the check-out records of their minor
children on grounds that such action would violate the child's
privacy rights.[23] The emotional and moral health of children is
thus sacrificed on the altar of &quot;intellectual freedom,&quot;
and parents are again prevented from fulfilling their responsibility
to protect the child.

<p>

The &quot;children's rights&quot; agenda perhaps is best embodied
in the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child,[24] an international
treaty adopted by the U.N. General Assembly in 1989.  According
to the United Nation's Children's Fund (UNICEF), the Convention
&quot;defines the minimum standards for civil, economic, social,
cultural, and political rights of children.&quot;[25] Ratifying nations
are called to guarantee a host of rights to children, including
&quot;the right to freedom of expression; . . . regardless of
frontiers,&quot; and the right &quot;to freedom of thought, conscience
and religion.&quot;[26]

<p>

More than 170 countries have ratified the Convention.  In February
1995, President Bill Clinton sent the treaty to the U.S. Senate
for possible ratification, where it is currently pending.  The
U.S. Constitution declares that international treaties ratified
by the U.S. become the &quot;supreme Law of the Land.&quot;[27] Therefore,
the U.N. Convention raises serious questions as to its implications
for parental rights in the U.S.  Are these &quot;children's rights&quot;
intended to be legally enforceable over and against the rights
and responsibilities of parents? What might be the scope of a
child's right, for example, to &quot;freedom of expression?&quot;[28]

<p>

<center><h3>Substituted Judgment</h3></center>

<p>

Competing interests of the family and state most frequently
meet in the public school arena.  Schools traditionally have functioned
<I>in loco parentis, i.e.,</I> in place of parents. This
implies that parents have delegated partial authority to the school.
But when school officials contradict the will or values of parents,
they exceed their delegated authority and substitute their judgment
for that of the parents.  Several recent examples from around
the country highlight the increasingly brazen tendency toward
substituted judgment in the public schools.

<p>

On March 19, 1996, 59 sixth-grade girls from the J.T. Lambert
Intermediate School in East Stroudsburg, Pennsylvania, were taken
to the school nurse's office where they were required to remove
their clothes and submit to a genital examination as part of a
&quot;routine&quot; physical.  While Pennsylvania state law allows
for physical examinations at elementary schools, the East Stroudsburg
parents quite naturally did not expect such an examination to
include intrusive vaginal exams.

<p>

One family was horrified to learn that their daughter had been
forced to undergo the exam despite the fact that they had already
taken the option of submitting an exam report from their own doctor.
Their daughter reported that she had told the school official
in charge that her report was on file, but the official said
that the school had lost the report and that the girl had no choice
but to have the exam.  The girl began to cry and plead with the
school officials to use the phone to call her mother.  But she
was prohibited from calling her mother, and the school nurse stood
in front of the door, blocking the exit.  After submitting to
the exam, she came home in tears, physically and emotionally hurt.[29]

<p>

When questioned, the school initially denied that the girls
had been touched at all.  The school then abruptly changed its
position and admitted that gynecological exams had been conducted
on these 11-year-olds to check for sexually-transmitted diseases
and sexual abuse, even though no incident of disease or abuse
had been indicated.  At the time of this writing, several families
had filed suit against the school, which continues to defend its
action.

</center>

Unfortunately, the outrage of East Stroudsburg is not an isolated
case.  In Stephens County, Georgia, Sharon and Waymon Earls were
shocked to discover that their 14- and 15-year-old daughters had
been driven to a birth control clinic by a public school staffer
without their knowledge.  The county clinic dispensed birth control
pills and condoms to the girls and administered Pap smears and
AIDS tests.  Mr. and Mrs. Earls were then denied access to the
test results by the school, which defended its actions on the
grounds that the counselor believed she was doing what was best
for the girls.  The counselor's husband, Stephens County School
Superintendent Ed Mills, admitted that his wife had driven many
other girls to the clinic over the years.[30]

<p>

Public schools are also increasingly adopting policies whereby
an entire class is subjected to mandatory psychological testing
or explicit sex education which contradicts the values taught
at home.  Psychological testing of children is often performed
under the guise of standardized tests which include intrusive
questions about the child's emotional state and sexual experiences,
the child's relationship with his or her parents, and values and
habits within the home.

<p>

For example, a 149-question survey used in Minnesota public
schools without parental approval contains questions such as:

<p><ul>

<li><i>Have you ever tried to kill yourself?

<br>

<li>How often have you run away from home?

<br>

<li>Have you felt so discouraged or hopeless that you wondered
if anything was worthwhile?</i>[31]

</ul><p>

In California, in 1994, a statewide controversy erupted over
one such test known as the California Learning Assessment System
(CLAS), a mandatory, standardized test administered to over a
million public school students.  After rumors began circulating
among parents regarding the intrusive nature of some of the questions,
the public school bureaucracy added insult to injury by refusing
to let parents even see the CLAS test their children would be
required to take.[32]

<p>

Parents who have challenged intrusive government policies in
court have met with decidedly mixed results.  Three high-profile
cases recently rejected by the U.S. Supreme Court serve as a disheartening
barometer of the status of parental rights.

<p>

<i><b>Newkirk v. Lansing:</b></i>[33]

<p>

During the 1989-1990 school
year, Daniel and Nancy Newkirk from East Lansing, Michigan, discovered
that their 8-year-old son Jason was being psychologically counseled
by an unlicensed, untrained guidance counselor against their express
wishes.  The case began when Jason's teacher told the Newkirks
that their son wasn't &quot;interacting&quot; with classmates
as she thought he should.  The parents agreed to let their son
&quot;play games&quot; (like checkers) with the guidance counselor,
but flatly refused to allow any psychological counseling.

<p>

Despite this apparent understanding, the counselor began subjecting
Jason to &quot;The Talking, Feeling, and Doing Game, a Psychotherapeutic
Game for Children.&quot;  While the manufacturer of this game
warns that it is intended for use &quot;only by mental health
professionals,&quot; the counselor had no such training.

<p>

Questions posed to young Jason from the game included:

<p><ul>

<li><i>Tell something about your mother that gets you angry.

<br>

<li>What do you think about a boy who sometimes wished that
his brother were dead?

<br>

<li>What is the worst thing you can say about your family?</i>[34]

</ul><p>

After the counseling began, the Newkirks noticed changes in
their son's attitude, and he began complaining to his parents
about his sessions with the counselor.  The Newkirks' confronted
the school, but were told that the relationship between the boy
and the counselor was &quot;confidential.&quot;  They then had
a psychiatrist examine Jason, who diagnosed the boy as having
suffered emotional damage from the sessions, including separation
anxiety disorder and panic attacks.

<p>

The Newkirks filed suit in July 1991 in U.S. District Court
against the school district and some of the school staff involved.
In March 1993, the U.S. District Court ruled against the parents.
On appeal, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed this ruling,
and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to review the case,
leaving the Newkirks with no further remedy.

<p>

<i><b>Brown v. Hot, Sexy and Safer Productions:</b></i>[35]

<p>

In 1992, students in a Chelmsford, Massachusetts public high
school were compelled to attend a sex education seminar by Suzi
Landolph entitled &quot;Hot, Sexy, and Safer.&quot;  A transcript
of Ms. Landolph's performance in Chelmsford reveals that it included
simulated masturbation, crude language, and condom licking.  Chelmsford
parents were given neither advance notice nor a chance to remove
their children from the seminar.

<p>

Ronald and Suzanne Brown and other Chelmsford parents filed
suit, alleging that the school's &quot;opt-out&quot; policy was
not followed.  The parents lost their case before the First Circuit
Court of Appeals in Massachusetts, and in March 1996 the U.S.
Supreme Court declined to review another major parental rights
case, allowing the lower court decision against the parents to
stand.

<p>

<i><b>Curtis v. School Comm. of Falmouth:</b></i>[36]

<p>

Elizabeth Curtis and other parents from Falmouth, Massachusetts, filed 
suit in 1992 against their school board's installation of condom vending
machines in their high schools.  Moreover, according to school
board policy, school nurses were to give condoms upon request
to children as young as 11 in the junior high schools, notwithstanding
the written objections of their parents.  The County Superior
Court refused to grant a parental &quot;opt-out&quot; of the condom
program, and an appeal was rejected by the Massachusetts Supreme
Court in July 1995.  In January 1996, Bay State parents suffered
another loss when the U.S. Supreme Court refused without comment
to hear their appeal, further undermining parental rights in the
state of Massachusetts.[37]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The Massachusetts Supreme Court maintained that because the
condom program was not &quot;coercive,&quot; the school was not
usurping parental rights:

<p><blockquote>

<i>[T]he students are free to decline to participate in the
program. . . . For their part, the plaintiffs are free to instruct
their children not to participate. . . . Although exposure to
condom vending machines and to the program itself may offend the
moral and religious sensibilities of the plaintiffs, mere exposure
to programs offered at school does not amount to unconstitutional
interference with parental liberties without the existence of
some compulsory aspects to the program.</i>[38]

</blockquote><p>

This passage from <I>Curtis</I> reveals how treating minors
as &quot;short adults&quot; works in tandem with state-substituted
judgment to undermine parental authority.  First, we are told
that the condom program is &quot;voluntary&quot; because the <I>students</I>
&quot;are free to decline to participate,&quot; <I>i.e.</I>, they
are autonomous actors capable of making their own decisions about
choices presented to them at school.  The school maintains a facade
of neutrality with regard to the choice presented, but by presenting
to the child extra-curricular options that starkly contradict
the values of the parent, the state is assisting the child in
circumventing the parent's will.

<p>

<center><h3>Reaffirming Parental Rights</h3></center>

<p>

Until recently, the primary battleground in the struggle to
preserve parental rights has been the state and federal court
system.  While individual families continue to press their case
in courts around the country, it has become increasingly clear
that parents need legislative remedies.  As a result, the parental
rights movement has become proactive, inspiring the introduction
of legislation designed to guarantee parental rights at the state
and federal levels.

<p>

In its most common form, the Parental Rights Amendment reads:
<I>&quot;The right of parents to direct the upbringing and education
of their children shall not be infringed.&quot;</I> By codifying
language taken directly from the 1925 <I>Pierce</I> case, the
Amendment would provide parents with an explicit right grounded
in their state constitution.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
The federal parental<br>
rights legislation is<br>
a negative mandate on<br>
government. It checks<br>
power, not enhances it.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

A statute designed to protect parental rights has also been
introduced in Congress.  In the fall of 1995, Sen. Charles Grassley
(R-Iowa) and Rep. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) introduced the &quot;Parental
Rights and Responsibilities Act&quot; (PRRA).  The PRRA would
protect parental rights, including directing or providing for
the education of the child; making a health or mental health care
decision for the child; disciplining the child, including reasonable
corporal discipline; and directing or providing for the religious
teaching of the child. The PRRA would clarify the fundamental
nature of parental rights, thus providing much-needed direction
to federal and lower courts.

<p>

The high court in <I>Meyer</I> and <I>Pierce</I> established
that parental rights are fundamental under the liberty interest
of the Fifth and 14th Amendments to the Constitution.  The state
may not infringe a fundamental right without having a compelling
reason to do so.

<p>

In several important cases, however, lower courts have begun
to consider parental rights as less than fundamental, allowing
the state to demonstrate merely a &quot;rational basis&quot; for
infringing the right -- a much lower hurdle to clear.[39] By declining
to review lower court decisions in cases such as <I>Newkirk v.
Lansing, Brown v. Hot, Sexy, and Safer,</I> and <I>Curtis v. Falmouth</I>
-- each of which treated parental rights as less than fundamental
-- the Supreme Court has allowed the rights it enunciated long
ago in <I>Meyer</I> and <I>Pierce</I> to die the proverbial &quot;death
of a thousand cuts.&quot; 

<p>

The PRRA would codify the Supreme Court's longstanding interpretation
of parental rights as a fundamental liberty interest, and would
instruct federal and lower courts to employ the &quot;compelling
interest&quot; test when considering parental rights cases.

<p>

Some have claimed that the Parental Rights and Responsibilities
Act raises federalism concerns.  But by virtue of the rulings
in <I>Meyer, Pierce, Yoder</I> and others, the federal government,
through the Supreme Court, has already acted to protect parental
rights under the due process clause of the 14th Amendment. Congress
is given express authority to enact legislation to protect due
process rights of citizens by Section Five of the 14th Amendment.

The clash over parental rights<br>
proposals begs the fundamental<br>
question: Are ordinary parents<br>

their children or should parents<br>
defer to elite authorities backed<br>
by state power?
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

It is important to remember that federal parental rights legislation
would not give Congress substantive authority over areas which
are properly a matter of state jurisdiction, such as education.
But when state regulation of education results in the violation
of  parents' constitutional rights, the federal government may
intervene to protect these rights.[40]

<p>

The federal parental rights legislation would not expand government
by creating a new federal &quot;program.&quot;  The PRRA would
not increase federal spending or require a new federal administrative
agency. Rather, the PRRA is a <I>negative</I> mandate on government.
It checks power, not enhances it.

<p>

<center><h3>The Fundamental Question: Who Decides?</h3></center>

<p>

Critics of both the federal parental rights bill and the state
constitutional amendments typically claim that parental rights
laws would make it tougher for the state to protect children from
abuse, and would give one parent the right to dictate school curriculum
for everyone else's child, leading to education gridlock.

<p>

These and most other criticisms are grounded in the mistaken
notion that these proposals would provide an <I>absolute</I> right
for parents, which would override any state interest in the welfare
and education of children.  But as both proposals seek to codify
the Meyer-Pierce doctrine, the well-established limits to parental
rights under this doctrine would continue to apply.

<p>

For example, in <I>Prince</I>, the high court made it clear
that &quot;neither the right of religion <I>nor the rights of
parents are beyond limitation</I>&quot; (Emphasis added).
<I>Prince</I> identified numerous areas in which the state may set
limits on parental rights, such as compulsory school attendance,
mandatory vaccination policies, and child labor laws.  And in
<I>Runyon v. McCrary,</I>[41] the Supreme Court held that parents
&quot;have no constitutional right to provide their children with
. . . education unfettered by reasonable government regulation.&quot;
All constitutional rights have their limits, and parental rights
are no exception.

<p>

The clash over parental rights proposals begs the fundamental
question: <I>Who decides what's in the best interests of childen?
Parents? Or the government?</I>  Are ordinary parents generally
competent to raise their children or should parents defer to elite
authorities backed by state power?

<p>

Unable to attack the underlying constitutional doctrine of
parent's rights, yet adamantly opposed to the people acting to
codify this doctrine through the democratic process, opponents
sometimes find themselves in the awkward position best expressed
by Elliot Mincberg, Executive Director of People for the American
Way, in criticizing the state Parental Rights Amendment: &quot;Our
view is that the Amendment is either unnecessary or it would seriously
conflict with the current legal notion of parental rights and
responsibilities.&quot;[42] Presumably, parental rights laws are
&quot;unnecessary&quot; in light of Supreme Court cases, which,
if codified, would be somehow radical and dangerous.

<p>

Other opponents go a step further in making explicit the fact
that parental rights laws are incompatible with the &quot;children's
rights&quot; agenda.  Professor Barbara Bennett Woodhouse of 
the University of Pennsylvania has written that the child should
be seen as &quot;having a direct relationship with government
. . . as public resource and public ward, entitled both to make
claims upon the community and to be claimed by the community.&quot;[43]
Prof. Woodhouse believes that focusing on parents' individual
rights &quot;objectifies&quot; children, and that the law should
concentrate on whether parents have &quot;earned&quot; the authority
they exercise over the child.[44]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

How might parents &quot;earn&quot; their authority? Perhaps
through government-mandated licensing of parents, as proposed
by Dr. Jack C. Westman, professor of psychiatry at the University
of Wisconsin. &quot;Just as individual responsibility for driving
a car is certified by a driver's license, the individual responsibility
of a parent for child rearing would be certified by a parenting
license.&quot;[45] Requiring parents to obtain a government license
before being allowed to conceive and bear children would complete
the shift from the state acting <I>in loco parentis</I> to the
state <I>as</I> parent. Primary authority over children would
inhere in the state, which would then delegate its authority to
the biological parents of the child -- assuming they pass the
exam.[46]

<p>

<center><h3>Linking Rights and Responsibilities</h3></center>

<p>

If successful, the parental rights movement will provide parents
with greater legal standing to ensure that government respects
their rights through its policies, and, when necessary, in the
courts.  But beyond this immediate, practical benefit, a national
debate on parental rights also has great potential to foster more
parental responsibility.

<p>

The key to encouraging greater parental responsibility is to
explicitly recognize the link between rights and duties upon which
this nation was founded, and to renew our optimism in the ability
of the people to manage their own affairs, as citizens and as
parents.  Indeed, &quot;the most terribly important things must
be left to ordinary men themselves,&quot; including the right
of parents to protect their children from harmful influences and
to direct their children's upbringing.  Recognizing the irreplaceable
role of parents is essential to keeping the power of the state
in check, revitalizing citizenship, and ensuring that children
receive the love, protection and guidance only a parent can provide.

<li>&quot;Formal high school education
beyond the eighth grade is contrary to Amish beliefs, not only
because it places Amish children in an environment hostile to
Amish beliefs with increasing emphasis on competition in class
work and sports and with pressure to conform to the styles, manners,
and ways of the peer group, but also because it takes them away
from their community, physically and emotionally, during the crucial
and formative adolescent period of life. . . . Amish society emphasizes
informal learning-though-doing; a life of 'goodness,'

Where the child is mature enough to express potentially conflicting

such an imposition without canvassing his views.  And, if an Amish

<title>SPARE THE ROD? NEW RESEARCH CHALLENGES SPANKING CRITICS</title>

<h1>Spare the Rod?</h1>
<h2><i>New Research Challenges Spanking Critics</i></h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>O</font>pposition to parents spanking their children has been 
growing significantly in elite circles over the past 15 years.[1] No doubt
much of this opposition springs from a sincere concern for the
well-being of children. Child abuse is a reality, and stories
of child abuse are horrifying. But while loving and effective
discipline is quite definitely <I>not</I> harsh and abusive, neither
is it weak and ineffectual. Indeed, disciplinary spanking can
fall well within the boundaries of loving discipline and need
not be labeled abusive violence.[2]

<p>

Or so most Americans seem to think.  According to a recent
Voter/Consumer Research poll commissioned by the Family Research
Council, 76 percent of the more than 1,000 Americans surveyed
said that spanking was an effective form of discipline in their
home when they were children.[3] These results are made all the
more impressive by the fact that nearly half of those who answered
otherwise grew up in homes in which they were never spanked.
Taken together, more than four out of five Americans who were
actually spanked by their parents as children say that it was
an effective form of discipline.

<p>

In addition, Americans perceive lack of discipline to be
the biggest problem in public education today, according to a
recent Gallup poll.[4] Several studies show strong public support
for corporal punishment by parents.[5]

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Critics claim that spanking a child is abusive and contributes
to adult dysfunction.  These allegations arise from studies that
fail to distinguish appropriate spanking from other forms of punishment.
Abusive forms of physical punishment such as kicking, punching,
and beating are commonly grouped with mild spanking.  Furthermore,
the studies usually include, and even emphasize, corporal punishment
of adolescents, rather than focusing on preschool children, where
spanking is more effective.  This blurring of distinctions between
spanking and physical abuse, and between children of different
ages, gives critics the illusion of having data condemning all
disciplinary spanking.

<p>

There are several arguments commonly leveled against disciplinary
spanking.  Interestingly, most of these arguments can be used
against other forms of discipline.  Any form of discipline (time-out,
restriction, etc.), when used inappropriately and in anger, can
result in distorting a child's perception of justice and harming
his emotional development.  In light of this, let us examine
some of the unfounded arguments promoted by spanking opponents.

<p>

<b>Argument #1:</b> <i>Many psychological studies show that spanking
is an improper form of discipline.</i>

<p>

<b>Counterpoint:</b> Researchers John Lyons, Rachel Anderson
and David Larson of the National Institute of Healthcare Research
recently conducted a systematic review of the research literature
on corporal punishment.[6] They found that 83 percent of the 132
identified articles published in clinical and psychosocial journals
were merely opinion-driven editorials, reviews or commentaries,
devoid of new empirical findings.  Moreover, most of the empirical
studies were methodologically flawed by grouping the impact of
abuse with spanking.  The best studies demonstrated beneficial,
not detrimental, effects of spanking in certain situations.  Clearly,
there is insufficient evidence to condemn parental spanking and
adequate evidence to justify its proper use.

<p>

<b>Argument #2:</b> <i>Physical punishment establishes the moral
righteousness of hitting other persons who do something which
is regarded as wrong.</i>

<p>

<b>Counterpoint:</b> The &quot;spanking teaches hitting&quot;
belief has gained in popularity over the past decade, but is not
supported by objective evidence.  A distinction must be made between
abusive hitting and nonabusive spanking.  A child's ability to
discriminate hitting from disciplinary spanking depends largely
upon the parents' attitude with spanking and the parents' procedure
for spanking.  There is no evidence in the medical literature
that a mild spank to the buttocks of a disobedient child by a
loving parent teaches the child aggressive behavior.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<center>
<font size=+1><b><i>
The critical issue is<br>
how spanking is used<br>
more than whether it<br>
is used.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

The critical issue is <I>how</I> spanking (or, in fact, any
punishment) is used more so than <I>whether</I> it is used.  Physical
abuse by an angry, uncontrolled parent will leave lasting emotional
wounds and cultivate bitterness and resentment within a child.
The balanced, prudent use of disciplinary spanking, however,
is an effective deterrent to aggressive behavior with some children.

<p>

Researchers at the Center for Family Research at Iowa State
University studied 332 families to examine both the impact of
corporal punishment and the quality of parental involvement on
three adolescent outcomes -- aggressiveness, delinquency, and
psychological well-being.  The researchers found a strong association
between the quality of parenting and each of these three outcomes.
Corporal  punishment, however, was <I>not</I> adversely related
to any of these outcomes.  This study proves the point that quality
of parenting is the chief determinant of favorable or unfavorable
outcomes.[7] Remarkably, childhood aggressiveness has been more
closely linked to maternal permissiveness and negative criticism
than to even abusive physical discipline.[8]

<p>

It is unrealistic to expect that children would never hit
others if their parents would only exclude spanking from their
discipline options.  Most children in their toddler years (long
before they are ever spanked) naturally attempt to hit others
when conflict or frustration arises.  The continuation of this
behavior is largely determined by how the parent or caregiver
responds. If correctly disciplined, the hitting will become less
frequent. If ignored or ineffectively disciplined, the hitting
will likely persist and even escalate.  Thus, instead of contributing
to greater violence, spanking can be a useful component in an
overall plan to effectively teach a child to stop aggressive hitting.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<b>Argument #3:</b> <i>Since parents often refrain from hitting
until the anger or frustration reaches a certain point, the child
learns that anger and frustration justify the use of physical
force.</i>

<p>

<b>Counterpoint:</b> A study published in <I>Pediatrics</I> indicates
that most parents who spank do not spank on impulse, but purposefully
spank their children with a belief in its effectiveness.[9] Furthermore,
the study revealed no significant correlation between the frequency
of spanking and the anger reported by mothers.  Actually, the
mothers who reported being angry were not the same parents who
spanked.

<p>

Reactive, impulsive hitting after losing control due to anger
is unquestionably the wrong way for a parent to use corporal punishment.
Eliminating all physical punishment in the home, however, would
not remedy such explosive scenarios.  It could even increase the
problem.  When effective spanking is removed from a parent's disciplinary
repertoire, he or she is left with nagging, begging, belittling,
and yelling, once the primary disciplinary measures -- such as time-out
and logical consequences -- have failed.  By contrast, if proper
spanking is proactively used in conjunction with other disciplinary
measures, better control of the particularly defiant child can
be achieved, and moments of exasperation are less likely to occur.

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<b>Argument #4:</b> <i>Physical punishment is harmful to a child.</i>

<p>

<b>Counterpoint:</b> Any disciplinary measure, physical, verbal
or emotional, carried to an extreme can harm a child.  Excessive
scolding and berating of a child by a parent is emotionally harmful.
Excessive use of isolation (time-out) for unreasonable periods
of time can humiliate a child and ruin the measure's effectiveness.
Obviously, excessive or indiscriminate physical punishment is
harmful and abusive.  However, an appropriately-administered spanking
of a forewarned disobedient child is not harmful when administered
in a loving controlled manner.

<p>

Without the prudent use of spanking for the particularly
defiant child, a parent runs the risk of being inconsistent and
rationalizing the child's behavior.  This inconsistent manner
of  parenting is confusing and harmful to the child and is damaging
to the parent-child relationship.  There is no evidence that proper
disciplinary spanking is harmful to the child.

<p>

<b>Argument #5:</b> <i>Physical punishment makes the child angry
at the parent.</i>

<p>

<b>Counterpoint:</b> All forms of punishment initially elicit
a frustrated, angry response from a child.  Progression of this
anger is dependent primarily upon the parent's attitude during
and after the disciplinary event, and the manner of its application.
Any form of punishment administered angrily for purposes of retribution,
rather than calmly for purposes of correction, can create anger
and resentment in a child.  Actually, a spanking can break the
escalating rage of a rebellious child and more quickly restore
the relationship between parent and child.

<font size=+1><b><i>
The use of the term<br>
'violence' in the<br>
spanking debate only<br>
serves to deepen the<br>
confusion.
</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<b>Argument #6:</b> <i>Spanking teaches a child that &quot;might
makes right,&quot; that power and strength are most important
and that the biggest can force their will upon the smallest.</i>

<p>

<b>Counterpoint:</b> Parental power is commonly exerted in routine
child rearing and spanking is only one example.  Other situations
where power and restraint are exercised by the average parent
include:

<p><ul>

<li>The young child who insists on running from his parent in
a busy mall or parking lot.

<p>

<li>The toddler who refuses to sit in his car seat.

<p>

<li>The young patient who refuses to hold still as a vaccination
is administered, or as a laceration is repaired.

</ul><p>

Power and control over the child are necessary at times to
ensure safety, health and proper behavior. Classic child rearing
studies have shown that some degree of power, assertion,[10] and firm
control[11] is essential for optimal child rearing. When power is
exerted in the context of love and for the child's benefit, the
child will not perceive it as bullying or demeaning.

<h2>A CLOSER LOOK</h2>

<p><hr width=60% noshade><p>

<h2>Distinguishing Spanking from Abuse</h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>C</font>orporal punishment is often defined broadly as 
<i>bodily punishment of any kind.</i> Since this definition includes 
spanking as well as obviously abusive acts such as kicking, punching, 
beating, face slapping, and even starvation, more specific definitions
must be used to separate appropriate versus inappropriate corporal
punishment.

<p>

Spanking is one of many disciplinary responses available
to parents intended to shape appropriate behavior in the developing
toddler and child.  It is an adjunctive corrective measure, to
be used in combination with primary responses such as restraint,
natural and logical consequences, time-out, and restriction of
privileges.

<p>

Child development experts believe spanking should be used
mainly as a back-up to primary measures, and then independently
to correct deliberate and persistent problem behavior that is
not remedied with milder measures.  It is most useful with toddlers
and preschoolers from 18 months to 6 years of age, when reasoning
is less persuasive.

<p>

Moreover, child development experts say that spanking should
always be a planned action by a parent, not an impulsive reaction
to misbehavior.  The child should be forewarned of the spanking
consequence for each of the designated problem behaviors.  Spanking
should always be administered in private. It should consist of
one or two spanks to the child's buttocks, followed by a calm
review of the offense and the desired behavior.

</pre>

</center>

<p><hr><p>

<b>Argument #7:</b> <i>Spanking is violence.</i>

<p>

<b>Counterpoint:</b> Spanking, as recommended by most primary
care physicians,[12] is not violence by definition (&quot;exertion
of physical force so as to injure or abuse&quot;).[13] Parents who
properly spank do not injure or abuse their child.

<p>

The use of this term &quot;violence&quot; in the spanking
debate only serves to deepen the confusion.  Why do anti-spanking
authors repeatedly fail to distinguish between abusive violence
and mild spanking?  The distinction is so fundamental and obvious
that its omission suggests that these authors use such terminology
for its propaganda value, not to clarify issues.

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

<b>Argument #8:</b> <i>Spanking is an ineffective solution to
misbehavior.</i>

<p>

<b>Counterpoint:</b> Though the specific use of appropriate spanking
has rarely been studied, there is evidence of its short-term and
long-term effectiveness. When combined with reasoning, the use
of negative consequences (including spanking) does effectively
decrease the frequency of misbehavior recurrences with preschool
children.[14] In clinical field trials where parental spanking has
been studied, it has consistently been found to reduce the subsequent
frequency of noncompliance with time-out.[15] Spanking, as a effective
enforcer of time-out, is a component of several well-researched
parent training programs[16] and popular parenting texts.[17]

<p>

Dr. Diana Baumrind of the Institute for Human Development
at the University of California-Berkeley, conducted a decade-long
study of families with children 3 to 9 years old.[18]
Baumrind found that parents employing a balanced disciplinary
style of firm control (including spanking) and positive encouragement
experienced the most favorable outcome in their children. Parents
taking extreme approaches to discipline (authoritarian-types using
excessive punishment with less encouragement or permissive-types
using little punishment and no spanking) were less successful.

<p>

Baumrind concluded that evidence from this study &quot;did
not indicate that negative reinforcement or corporal punishment
per se were harmful or ineffective procedures, but rather the
total patterns of parental control determined the effects on the
child of these procedures.&quot;

<p>

This approach of balanced parenting, employing the occasional
use of spanking, is advocated by several child rearing experts.[19]
In the hands of loving parents, a spanking to the buttocks of
a defiant toddler in appropriate settings is a powerful motivator
to correct behavior and an effective deterrent to disobedience.

<p>

<b>Argument #9:</b> <i>Adults who were spanked as children are
at risk for using violence as a means of resolving conflicts as
adults.</i>

<p>

<b>Counterpoint:</b> This theory comes from work done by Murray
Straus of the Family Research Lab at the University of New Hampshire.
Straus' conclusions are based upon theoretical models and survey
results of adults recalling spankings as teenagers. His work
is not clinical research, and many experts believe that his conclusions
go far beyond his data.  As with most of Straus' survey research,
teenage spanking is the focus, not the selective use of spanking
of young children by reasonable parents. The evidence for his
conclusion disappears when parental spanking is measured between
the ages of 2 and 8 years, and when childhood aggression is measured
at a later age.

</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

In a 1994 review article on corporal punishment, Dr. Robert
E. Larzelere, a director of research at Boys Town, Nebraska, presents
evidence supporting a parent's selective use of spanking of children,
particularly those 2 to 6 years old.[20] After thoroughly reviewing
the literature, Larzelere concludes that any association between
spanking and antisocial aggressiveness in children is insignificant
and artifactual.

<p>

After a decade of longitudinal study of children beginning
in third grade, Dr. Leonard Eron found no association between
punishment (including spanking) and later aggression.  Eron, a
clinical psychologist at the Univeristy of Michigan's Institute
for Social Research, concluded, &quot;Upon follow-up 10 years
after the original data collection, we found that punishment of
aggressive acts at the earlier age was no longer related to current
aggression, and instead, other variables like parental nurturance
and children's identification with their parents were more important
in predicting later aggression.&quot;[21]

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Again, it is the total pattern of parenting that determines the
outcome of a parent's efforts.

<p>

<b>Argument #10:</b> <i>Spanking leads a parent to use harmful
forms of corporal punishment which lead to physical child abuse.</i>

<p>

<b>Counterpoint:</b> The abuse potential when loving parents
use appropriate disciplinary spanking is very low.  Since parents
have a natural affection for their children, they are more prone
to underutilize spanking than to overutilize it.  Both empirical
data and professional opinion oppose the concept of a causal relationship
between spanking and child abuse.

<p>

Surveys indicate that 70 to 90 percent of parents of preschoolers
use spanking,[22] yet the incidence of physical child abuse in
America is only about 5 percent. Statistically, the two practices
are far apart. Furthermore, over the past decade reports of child
abuse have steadily risen while approval for parental spanking
has steadily declined.[23]

<p>

More than 70 percent of primary care pediatricians reject
the idea that spanking sets the stage for parents to engage in
forms of physical abuse.[24]

<p>

Teaching parents appropriate spanking may actually reduce
child abuse, according to Larzelere, in his 1994 review article
on corporal punishment.[25] Parents who are ill-equipped to control
their child's behavior, or who take a more permissive approach
(refusing to use spanking), may be more prone to anger[26] and explosive
attacks on their child.[27]

<p>

Parental child abuse is an interactive process involving
parental competence, parental and child temperaments, and situational
demands.[28] Abusive parents are more angry, depressed and impulsive,
and emphasize punishment as the predominant means of discipline.
Abused children are more aggressive and less compliant than children
from nonabusive families. There is less interaction between family
members in abusive families and abusive mothers display more negative
than positive behavior. The etiology of abusive parenting is
multifactorial with emphasis on the personalities involved, and
cannot be simply explained by a parent's use of spanking.

<p>

In a letter to the editor in a 1995 issue of <I>Pediatrics</I>,
Drs. Lawrence S. Wissow and Debra Roter of Johns Hopkins University's
pediatrics department acknowledge that a definitive link between
spanking and child abuse has yet to be established.[29]

<p>

Finally, the Swedish experiment to reduce child abuse by
banning spanking seems to be failing.  In 1980, one year after
this ban was adopted, the rate of child beatings was twice that
of the United States.[30] According to a 1995 report from the government
organization Statistics Sweden, police reports of child abuse
by family members rose four-fold from 1984 to 1994, while reports
of teen violence increased nearly six-fold.[31]

</i></b></font>
</center>

<p><hr size=3 width=60% noshade><p>

Most experts agree that spanking and child abuse are not
on the same continuum, but are very different entities.  With
parenting, it is the &quot;user&quot; and <I>how</I> a measure
is used much more than the measure used that determines the outcome
of the disciplinary effort.  Clearly, spanking can be safely used
in the discipline of young children with an excellent outcome.
The proper use of spanking may actually reduce a parent's risk
of abusing the child.

<p>

<b>Argument #11:</b> <i>Spanking is never necessary.</i>

<p>

<b>Counterpoint:</b> All children need a combination of encouragement
and correction as they are disciplined to become socially responsible
individuals. In order for correction to deter disobedient behavior,
the consequence imposed upon the child must outweigh the pleasure
of the disobedient act. For very compliant children, milder forms
of correction will suffice and spanking may never be necessary.
For more defiant children who refuse to comply with or be persuaded
by milder consequences such as time-out, spanking is useful, effective,
and appropriate.

<center><h3>Conclusion</h3></center>

<p>

The subject of disciplinary spanking should be evaluated
from a factual and philosophical perspective. It must be distinguished
from abusive, harmful forms of corporal punishment. Appropriate
disciplinary spanking can play an important role in optimal child
development, and has been found in prospective studies to be a
part of the parenting style associated with the best outcomes.
There is no evidence that mild spanking is harmful. Indeed,
spanking is supported by history, research, and a majority of
primary care physicians.

<h2>Guidelines for Disciplinary Spanking</h2>

</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>T</font>he following are guidelines that Dr. Den Trumball 
has used to advise the parents he serves in disciplining children. 
These guidelines should help policymakers appreciate the legitimacy
of disciplinary spanking.

<p>

1. Spanking should be used selectively for clear, deliberate
misbehavior, particularly that which arises from a child's persistent
defiance of a parent's instruction.  It should be used only when
the child receives at least as much encouragement and praise for
good behavior as correction for problem behavior.

<p>

2. Milder forms of discipline, such as verbal correction,
time-out, and logical consequences, should be used initially,
followed by spanking when noncompliance persists.  Spanking has
shown to be an effective method of enforcing time-out with the
child who refuses to comply.

<p>

3. Only a parent (or in exceptional situations, someone else
who has an intimate relationship of authority with the child)
should administer a spanking.

<p>

4. Spanking should not be administered on impulse or when a parent
is out of control.  A spanking should always be motivated by love
for the purpose of teaching and correcting, never for revenge.

<p>

5. Spanking is inappropriate before 15 months of age and is usually
not necessary until after 18 months.  It should be less necessary
after 6 years, and rarely, if ever, used after 10 years of age.

<p>

6. After 10 months of age, one slap to the hand of a stubborn
crawler or toddler may be necessary to stop serious misbehavior
when distraction and removal have failed.  This is particularly
the case when the forbidden object is immovable and dangerous,
such as a hot oven door or an electrical outlet.

<p>

7. Spanking should always be a planned action, not a reaction,
by the parent and should follow a deliberate procedure.

<p><ul>

<li>The child should be forewarned of the spanking consequence
for designated problem behaviors.

<p>

<li>Spanking should always be administered in private (bedroom
or restroom) to avoid public humiliation or embarassment.

<p>

<li>One or two spanks should be administered to the buttocks.
This is followed by embracing the child and calmly reviewing
the offense and the desired behavior in an effort to reestablish
a warm relationship.

</ul><p>

8. Spanking should leave only transient redness of the skin and
should never cause physical injury.

<p>

9. If properly administered spankings are ineffective, other
appropriate disciplinary responses should be tried, or the parent
should seek professional help. Parents should never increase
the intensity of spankings.

Ronald W. ROSENBERGER, et al., Petitioners v.
<P>
RECTOR AND VISITORS OF the UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA et al.
<P>
No. 94-329.
<P>
Supreme Court of the United States
<P>
Argued March 1, 1995.
<P>
Decided June 29, 1995.
<P>
</center>
<P>
*2511
<P>
Syllabus (FN*)
<P>
Respondent University of Virginia, a state instrumentality, authorizes
payments from its Student Activities Fund (SAF) to outside contractors
for the printing costs of a variety of publications issued by
student groups called &quot;Contracted Independent Organizations&quot;
(CIOs). The SAF receives its money from mandatory student fees
and is designed to support a broad range of extracurricular student
activities related to the University's educational purpose. CIOs
must include in their dealings with third parties and in all written
materials a disclaimer stating that they are independent of the
University and that the University is not responsible for them.
The University withheld authorization for payments to a printer
on behalf of petitioners' CIO, Wide Awake Productions (WAP), solely
because its student newspaper, Wide Awake:
<P>
A Christian Perspective at the University of Virginia, *2512 &quot;primarily
promotes or manifests a particular belie[f] in or about a deity
or an ultimate reality,&quot; as prohibited by the University's
SAF Guidelines. Petitioners filed this suit under 42 U.S.C. Sec.
1983, alleging, inter alia, that the refusal to authorize payment
violated their First Amendment right to freedom of speech.
<P>
After the District Court granted summary judgment for the University,
the Fourth Circuit affirmed, holding that the University's invocation
of viewpoint discrimination to deny third-party payment violated
the Speech Clause, but concluding that the discrimination was
justified by the necessity of complying with the Establishment
Clause.
<P>
Held:
<P>
1. The Guideline invoked to deny SAF support, both in its terms
and in its application to these petitioners, is a denial of their
right of free speech. Pp. 2516-2520.
<P>
(a) The Guideline violates the principles governing speech in
limited public forums, which apply to the SAF under, e.g., Perry
Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U.S. 37, 46-47,
103 S.Ct. 948, 955-956, 74 L.Ed.2d 794. In determining whether
a State is acting within its power to preserve the limits it has
set for such a forum so that the exclusion of a class of speech
there is legitimate, see, e.g., id., at 49, 103 S.Ct., at 957,
this Court has observed a distinction between, on the one hand,
content discrimination-- i.e., discrimination against speech because
of its subject matter--which may be permissible if it preserves
the limited forum's purposes, and, on the other hand, viewpoint
discrimination--i.e., discrimination because of the speaker's
specific motivating ideology, opinion, or perspective--which is
presumed impermissible when directed against speech otherwise
within the forum's limitations, see id., at 46, 103 S.Ct., at
955. The most recent and most apposite case in this area is Lamb's
Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U.S. ----,
----, 113 S.Ct. 2141, 2147, 124 L.Ed.2d 352, in which the Court
held that permitting school property to be used for the presentation
of all views on an issue except those dealing with it from a religious
standpoint constitutes prohibited viewpoint discrimination. Here,
as in that case, the State's actions are properly interpreted
as unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination rather than permissible
line-drawing based on content:
<P>
By the very terms of the SAF prohibition, the University does
not exclude religion as a subject matter, but selects for disfavored
treatment those student journalistic efforts with religious editorial
viewpoints. Pp. 2516-2518.
<P>
(b) The University's attempt to escape the consequences of Lamb's
Chapel by urging that this case involves the provision of funds
rather than access to facilities is unavailing. Although it may
regulate the content of expression when it is the speaker or when
it enlists private entities to convey its own message, Rust v.
Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 111 S.Ct. 1759, 114 L.Ed.2d 233;
<P>
Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 276, 102 S.Ct. 269, 277-278,
70 L.Ed.2d 440, the University may not discriminate based on the
viewpoint of private persons whose speech it subsidizes, Regan
v. Taxation with Representation of Wash., 461 U.S. 540, 548, 103
S.Ct. 1997, 2002, 76 L.Ed.2d 129. Its argument that the scarcity
of public money may justify otherwise impermissible viewpoint
discrimination among private speakers is simply wrong. Pp. 2518-2520.
<P>
(c) Vital First Amendment speech principles are at stake here.
The Guideline at issue has a vast potential reach: The term &quot;promotes&quot;
as used there would comprehend any writing advocating a philosophic
position that rests upon a belief (or nonbelief) in a deity or
ultimate reality, while the term &quot;manifests&quot; would bring
within the prohibition any writing resting upon a premise presupposing
the existence (or nonexistence) of a deity or ultimate reality.
It is difficult to name renowned thinkers whose writings would
be accepted, save perhaps for articles disclaiming all connection
to their ultimate philosophy. Pp. 2519-2520.
<P>
2. The violation following from the University's denial of SAF
support to petitioners is not excused by the necessity of complying
with the Establishment Clause. Pp. 2520-2525.
<P>
(a) The governmental program at issue is neutral toward religion.
Such neutrality is a significant factor in upholding programs
in *2513 the face of Establishment Clause attack, and the guarantee
of neutrality is not offended where, as here, the government follows
neutral criteria and even-handed policies to extend benefits to
recipients whose ideologies and viewpoints,
<P>
including religious ones, are broad and diverse, Board of Ed.
of Kiryas Joel v. Grumet, 512 U.S. ----, ----, 114 S.Ct. 2481,
2491-2492, 129 L.Ed.2d 546. There is no suggestion that the University
created its program to advance religion or aid a religious cause.
The SAF's purpose is to open a forum for speech and to support
various student enterprises, including the publication of newspapers,
in recognition of the diversity and creativity of student life.
The SAF Guidelines have a separate classification for, and do
not make third-party payments on behalf of, &quot;religious organizations,&quot;
and WAP did not seek a subsidy because of its Christian editorial
viewpoint; it sought funding under the Guidelines as a &quot;student
... communications ... grou[p].&quot; Neutrality is also apparent
in the fact that the University has taken pains to disassociate
itself from the private speech involved in this case. The program's
neutrality distinguishes the student fees here from a tax levied
for the direct support of a church or group of churches, which
would violate the Establishment Clause. Pp. 2520-2523.
<P>
(b) This case is not controlled by the principle that special
Establishment Clause dangers exist where the government makes
direct money payments to sectarian institutions, see, e.g., Roemer
v. Board of Public Works, 426 U.S. 736, 747, 96 S.Ct. 2337, 2345,
49 L.Ed.2d 179, since it is undisputed that no public funds flow
directly into WAP's coffers under the program at issue. A public
university does not violate the Establishment Clause when it grants
access to its facilities on a religion-neutral basis to a wide
spectrum of student groups, even if some of those groups would
use the facilities for devotional exercises. See e.g., Widmar,
454 U.S., at 269, 102 S.Ct., at 274. This is so even where the
upkeep, maintenance, and repair of those facilities is paid out
of a student activities fund to which students are required to
contribute. Id., at 265, 102 S.Ct., at 272. There is no difference
in logic or principle, and certainly no difference of constitutional
significance, between using such funds to operate a facility to
which students have access, and paying a third-party contractor
to operate the facility on its behalf. That is all that is involved
here: The University provides printing services to a broad spectrum
of student newspapers. Were the contrary view to become law, the
University could only avoid a constitutional violation by scrutinizing
the content of student speech, lest it contain too great a religious
message. Such censorship would be far more inconsistent with the
Establishment Clause's dictates than would governmental provision
of secular printing services on a religion-blind basis. Pp. 2523-2525.
<P>

<P>
Justice KENNEDY delivered the opinion of the Court.
<P>
The University of Virginia, an instrumentality of the Commonwealth
for which it is named and thus bound by the First and Fourteenth
Amendments, authorizes the payment of outside contractors for
the printing costs of a variety of student publications. It withheld
any authorization for payments on behalf of petitioners for the
sole reason that their student paper &quot;primarily promotes
or manifests a particular belie[f] in or about a deity or an ultimate
reality.&quot; That the paper did promote or manifest views within
the defined exclusion seems plain enough. The challenge is to
the University's regulation and its denial of authorization, the
case raising issues under the Speech and Establishment Clauses
of the First Amendment.
<P>

<P>
The public corporation we refer to as the &quot;University&quot;
is denominated by state law as &quot;the Rector and Visitors of
the University of Virginia,&quot; Va.Code Ann. Sec. 23-69 (1993),
and it is responsible for governing the school, see Secs. 23-69
to 23-80. Founded by Thomas Jefferson in 1819, and ranked by him,
together with the authorship of the Declaration of Independence
and of the Virginia Act for Religious Freedom, Va.Code Ann. Sec.
57-1, as one of his proudest achievements, the University is among
the Nation's oldest and most respected seats of higher learning.
It has more than 11,000 undergraduate students, and 6,000 graduate
and professional students. An understanding of the case requires
a somewhat detailed description of the program the University
created to support extracurricular student activities on its campus.
<P>
Before a student group is eligible to submit bills from its outside
contractors for payment by the fund described below, it must become
a &quot;Contracted Independent Organization&quot; (CIO). CIO status
is available to any group the majority of whose members are students,
whose managing officers are fulltime students, and that complies
with certain procedural requirements. App. to Pet. for Cert. 2a.
A CIO must file its constitution with the University; must pledge
not to discriminate in its membership; and must include in dealings
with third parties and in all written materials a disclaimer,
stating that the CIO is independent of the University and that
the University is not responsible for the CIO. App. 27-28. CIOs
enjoy access to University facilities, including meeting rooms
and computer terminals. Id., at 30. A standard agreement signed
between each CIO and the University provides that the benefits
and opportunities afforded to CIOs &quot;should not be misinterpreted
as meaning that those organizations are part of or controlled
by the University, that the University is responsible for the
organizations' contracts or other acts or omissions, or that the
University approves of the organizations' goals or activities.&quot;
Id., at 26.
<P>
All CIOs may exist and operate at the University, but some are
also entitled to apply for funds from the Student Activities Fund
(SAF). Established and governed by University Guidelines, the
purpose of the SAF is to support a broad range of extracurricular
student activities that &quot;are related to the educational purpose
of the University.&quot; App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a. The SAF is
based on the University's &quot;recogni[tion] that the availability
of a wide range of opportunities&quot; for its students &quot;tends
to enhance the University environment.&quot; App. 26. The Guidelines
require that it be administered &quot;in a manner consistent with
the educational purpose of the University as well as with state
and federal law.&quot; App. to Pet. for Cert. 61a. The SAF receives
its money from a mandatory fee of $14 per semester assessed to
each full-time student. The Student Council, elected by the students,
has the initial authority to disburse the funds, but its actions
are subject to review by a faculty body chaired by a designee
of the Vice President for Student Affairs. Cf. id., at 63a-64a.
<P>
Some, but not all, CIOs may submit disbursement requests to the
SAF. The Guidelines recognize 11 categories of student groups
that may seek payment to third-party contractors because they
&quot;are related to the educational purpose of the University
of Virginia.&quot; Id., at 61a-62a. One of these is &quot;student
news, information, opinion, entertainment, or academic communications
media groups.&quot;
<P>
Id., at 61a. The Guidelines also specify, however, that the costs
of certain activities of CIOs that are otherwise eligible for
funding will not be reimbursed by the SAF. The student activities
which are excluded from SAF support are religious activities,
philanthropic contributions and activities, political activities,
activities that would jeopardize the University's tax exempt status,
those which involve payment of honoraria or similar fees, or social
entertainment or related expenses. Id., at 62a-63a. The prohibition
on &quot;political activities&quot; is defined so that it is limited
to electioneering and lobbying. The Guidelines provide that &quot;[t]hese
restrictions on funding political activities are not intended
to preclude funding of any otherwise eligible student organization
which ... espouses particular positions or ideological viewpoints,
including those that may be *2515 unpopular or are not generally
accepted.&quot; Id., at 65a-66a. A &quot;religious activity,&quot;
by contrast, is defined as any activity that &quot;primarily promotes
or manifests a particular belie[f] in or about a deity or an ultimate
reality.&quot; Id., at 66a.
<P>
The Guidelines prescribe these criteria for determining the amounts
of third-party disbursements that will be allowed on behalf of
each eligible student organization: the size of the group, its
financial self-sufficiency, and the University-wide benefit of
its activities. If an organization seeks SAF support, it must
submit its bills to the Student Council, which pays the organization's
creditors upon determining that the expenses are appropriate.
No direct payments are made to the student groups. During the
1990-1991 academic year, 343 student groups qualified as CIOs.
One hundred thirty-five of them applied for support from the SAF,
and 118 received funding. Fifteen of the groups were funded as
&quot;student news, information, opinion, entertainment, or academic
communications media groups.&quot;
<P>
Petitioners' organization, Wide Awake Productions (WAP), qualified
as a CIO. Formed by petitioner Ronald Rosenberger and other undergraduates
in 1990, WAP was established &quot;[t]o publish a magazine of
philosophical and religious expression,&quot; &quot;[t]o facilitate
discussion which fosters an atmosphere of sensitivity to and tolerance
of Christian viewpoints,&quot; and &quot;[t]o provide a unifying
focus for Christians of multicultural backgrounds.&quot; App.
67. WAP publishes Wide Awake: A Christian Perspective at the University
of Virginia. The paper's Christian viewpoint was evident from
the first issue, in which its editors wrote that the journal &quot;offers
a Christian perspective on both personal and community issues,
especially those relevant to college students at the University
of Virginia.&quot; App. 45. The editors committed the paper to
a two-fold mission: &quot;to challenge Christians to live, in
word and deed, according to the faith they proclaim and to encourage
students to consider what a personal relationship with Jesus Christ
means.&quot; Ibid. The first issue had articles about racism,
crisis pregnancy, stress, prayer, C.S. Lewis' ideas about evil
and free will, and reviews of religious music. In the next two
issues, Wide Awake featured stories about homosexuality, Christian
missionary work, and eating disorders, as well as music reviews
and interviews with University professors. Each page of Wide Awake,
and the end of each article or review, is marked by a cross. The
advertisements carried in Wide Awake also reveal the Christian
perspective of the journal. For the most part, the advertisers
are churches, centers for Christian study, or Christian bookstores.
By June 1992, WAP had distributed about 5,000 copies of Wide Awake
to University students, free of charge.
<P>
WAP had acquired CIO status soon after it was organized. This
is an important consideration in this case, for had it been a
&quot;religious organization,&quot; WAP would not have been accorded
CIO status. As defined by the Guidelines, a &quot;religious organization&quot;
is &quot;an organization whose purpose is to practice a devotion
to an acknowledged ultimate reality or deity.&quot; App. to Pet.
for Cert. 66a. At no stage in this controversy has the University
contended that WAP is such an organization.
<P>
A few months after being given CIO status, WAP requested the SAF
to pay its printer $5,862 for the costs of printing its newspaper.
The Appropriations Committee of the Student Council denied WAP's
request on the ground that Wide Awake was a &quot;religious activity&quot;
within the meaning of the Guidelines, i.e., that the newspaper
&quot;promote[d] or manifest[ed] a particular belie[f] in or about
a deity or an ultimate reality.&quot; Ibid. It made its determination
after examining the first issue. App. 54. WAP appealed the denial
to the full Stud ent Council, contending that WAP met all the
applicable Guidelines and that denial of SAF support on the basis
of the magazine's religious perspective violated the Constitution.
The appeal was denied without further comment, and WAP appealed
to the next level, the Student Activities Committee. In a letter
signed by the Dean of Students, the committee sustained the denial
of funding. App. 55.
<P>
Having no further recourse within the University structure, WAP,
Wide Awake, and three of its editors and members filed suit in
*2516 the United States District Court for the Western District
of Virginia, challenging the SAF's action as violative of Rev.Stat.
Sec. 1979, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983. They alleged that refusal to authorize
payment of the printing costs of the publication, solely on the
basis of its religious editorial viewpoint, violated their rights
to freedom of speech and press, to the free exercise of religion,
and to equal protection of the law. They relied also upon Article
I of the Virginia Constitution and the Virginia Act for Religious
Freedom, Va.Code Ann. Secs. 57-1, 57-2 (1986 and Supp.1994), but
did not pursue those theories on appeal. The suit sought damages
for the costs of printing the paper, injunctive and declaratory
relief, and attorney's fees.
<P>
On cross-motions for summary judgment, the District Court ruled
for the University, holding that denial of SAF support was not
an impermissible content or viewpoint discrimination against petitioners'
speech, and that the University's Establishment Clause concern
over its &quot;religious activities&quot; was a sufficient justification
for denying payment to third-party contractors. The court did
not issue a definitive ruling on whether reimbursement, had it
been made here, would or would not have violated the Establishment
Clause. 795 F.Supp. 175, 181-182 (WD Va.1992).
<P>
The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in
disagreement with the District Court, held that the Guidelines
did discriminate on the basis of content. It ruled that, while
the State need not underwrite speech, there was a presumptive
violation of the Speech Clause when viewpoint discrimination was
invoked to deny third-party payment otherwise available to CIOs.
18 F.3d 269, 279-281 (1994). The Court of Appeals affirmed the
judgment of the District Court nonetheless, concluding that the
discrimination by the University was justified by the &quot;compelling
interest in maintaining strict separation of church and state.&quot;
Id., at 281.
<P>
II
<P>
It is axiomatic that the government may not regulate speech based
on its substantive content or the message it conveys. Police Dept.
of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 96, 92 S.Ct. 2286, 2290, 33
L.Ed.2d 212 (1972). Other principles follow from this precept.
In the realm of private speech or expression, government regulation
may not favor one speaker over another. City Council of Los Angeles
v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789, 804, 104 S.Ct. 2118, 2128,
80 L.Ed.2d 772 (1984). Discrimination against speech because of
its message is presumed to be unconstitutional. See Turner Broadcasting
System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.S. ----, ----, 114 S.Ct. 2445, 2458-2459,
129 L.Ed.2d 497 (1994). These rules informed our determination
that the government offends the First Amendment when it imposes
financial burdens on certain speakers based on the content of
their expression. Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N.Y.
State Crime Victims Bd., 502 U.S. 105, 115, 112 S.Ct. 501, 507-508,
116 L.Ed.2d 476 (1991). When the government targets not subject
matter but particular views taken by speakers on a subject, the
violation of the First Amendment is all the more blatant. See
R.A.V. v. St. Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 391, 112 S.Ct. 2538, ----, 120
L.Ed.2d 305 (1992). Viewpoint discrimination is thus an egregious
form of content discrimination. The government must abstain from
regulating speech when the specific motivating ideology or the
opinion or perspective of the speaker is the rationale for the
restriction. See Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn.,
460 U.S. 37, 46, 103 S.Ct. 948, 955, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983).
<P>
These principles provide the framework forbidding the State from
exercising viewpoint discrimination, even when the limited public
forum is one of its own creation. In a case involving a school
district's provision of school facilities for private uses, we
declared that &quot;[t]here is no question that the District,
like the private owner of property, may legally preserve the property
under its control for the use to which it is dedicated.&quot;
Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508
U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 2141, 2146, 124 L.Ed.2d 352 (1993).
The necessities of confining a forum to the limited and legitimate
purposes for which it was created may justify the State in reserving
it for certain groups or for the discussion *2517 of certain topics.
See, e.g., Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense &amp; Ed. Fund, Inc.,
473 U.S. 788, 806, 105 S.Ct. 3439, 3451, 87 L.Ed.2d 567 (1985);
Perry Ed. Assn., supra, at 49, 103 S.Ct., at 957. Once it has
opened a limited forum, however, the State must respect the lawful
boundaries it has itself set. The State may not exclude speech
where its distinction is not &quot;reasonable in light of the
purpose served by the forum,&quot; Cornelius, supra, at 804-806,
105 S.Ct. at 3450-51; see also Perry Ed. Assn., supra, at 46,
49, 103 S.Ct., at 955, 957, nor may it discriminate against speech
on the basis of its viewpoint, Lamb's Chapel, supra, at ----,
113 S.Ct., at 2147; see also Perry Ed. Assn., supra, at 46, 103
S.Ct., at 955; R.A.V., supra, at 386-388, 391-393, 112 S.Ct.,
at ---- - ----, ---- - ----; cf. Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397,
414-415, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 2545, 105 L.Ed.2d 342 (1989). Thus, in
determining whether the State is acting to preserve the limits
of the forum it has created so that the exclusion of a class of
speech is legitimate, we have observed a distinction between,
on the one hand, content discrimination, which may be permissible
if it preserves the purposes of that limited forum, and, on the
other hand, viewpoint discrimination, which is presumed impermissible
when directed against speech otherwise within the forum's limitations.
See Perry Ed. Assn., supra, at 46, 103 S.Ct., at 955.
<P>
The SAF is a forum more in a metaphysical than in a spatial or
geographic sense, but the same principles are applicable. See,
e.g., Perry Ed. Assn., supra, at 46-47, 103 S.Ct., at 955-956
(forum analysis of a school mail system); Cornelius, supra, at
801, 105 S.Ct., at 3448 (forum analysis of charitable contribution
program). The most recent and most apposite case is our decision
in Lamb's Chapel, supra. There, a school district had opened school
facilities for use after school hours by community groups for
a wide variety of social, civic, and recreational purposes. The
district, however, had enacted a formal policy against opening
facilities to groups for religious purposes. Invoking its policy,
the district rejected a request from a group desiring to show
a film series addressing various child-rearing questions from
a &quot;Christian perspective.&quot; There was no indication in
the record in Lamb's Chapel that the request to use the school
facilities was &quot;denied for any reason other than the fact
that the presentation would have been from a religious perspective.&quot;
508 U.S., at ---- - ----, 113 S.Ct., at 2145. Our conclusion was
unanimous: &quot;[I]t discriminates on the basis of viewpoint
to permit school property to be used for the presentation of all
views about family issues and child-rearing except those dealing
with the subject matter from a religious standpoint.&quot; Ibid.
<P>
The University does acknowledge (as it must in light of our precedents)
that &quot;ideologically driven attempts to suppress a particular
point of view are presumptively unconstitutional in funding, as
in other contexts,&quot; but insists that this case does not present
that issue because the Guidelines draw lines based on content,
not viewpoint. Brief for Respondents 17, n. 10. As we have noted,
discrimination against one set of views or ideas is but a subset
or particular instance of the more general phenomenon of content
discrimination.
<P>
See, e.g., R.A.V., supra, at 391, 112 S.Ct., at ----. And, it
must be acknowledged, the distinction is not a precise one. It
is, in a sense, something of an understatement to speak of religious
thought and discussion as just a viewpoint, as distinct from a
comprehensive body of thought. The nature of our origins and destiny
and their dependence upon the existence of a divine being have
been subjects of philosophic inquiry throughout human history.
We conclude, nonetheless, that here, as in Lamb's Chapel, viewpoint
discrimination is the proper way to interpret the University's
objections to Wide Awake. By the very terms of the SAF prohibition,
the University does not exclude religion as a subject matter but
selects for disfavored treatment those student journalistic efforts
with religious editorial viewpoints. Religion may be a vast area
of inquiry, but it also provides, as it did here, a specific premise,
a perspective, a standpoint from which a variety of subjects may
be discussed and considered. The prohibited perspective, not the
general subject matter, resulted in the refusal to make third-party
payments, for the subjects discussed were *2518 otherwise within
the approved category of publications.
<P>
The dissent's assertion that no viewpoint discrimination occurs
because the Guidelines discriminate against an entire class of
viewpoints reflects an insupportable assumption that all debate
is bipolar and that anti-religious speech is the only response
to religious speech. Our understanding of the complex and multifaceted
nature of public discourse has not embraced such a contrived description
of the marketplace of ideas. If the topic of debate is, for example,
racism, then exclusion of several views on that problem is just
as offensive to the First Amendment as exclusion of only one.
It is as objectionable to exclude both a theistic and an atheistic
perspective on the debate as it is to exclude one, the other,
or yet another political, economic, or social viewpoint. The dissent's
declaration that debate is not skewed so long as multiple voices
are silenced is simply wrong; the debate is skewed in multiple
ways.
<P>
The University's denial of WAP's request for third-party payments
in the present case is based upon viewpoint discrimination not
unlike the discrimination the school district relied upon in Lamb's
Chapel and that we found invalid. The church group in Lamb's Chapel
would have been qualified as a social or civic organization, save
for its religious purposes. Furthermore, just as the school district
in Lamb's Chapel pointed to nothing but the religious views of
the group as the rationale for excluding its message, so in this
case the University justifies its denial of SAF participation
to WAP on the ground that the contents of Wide Awake reveal an
avowed religious perspective. See supra, at 2515. It bears only
passing mention that the dissent's attempt to distinguish Lamb's
Chapel is entirely without support in the law. Relying on the
transcript of oral argument, the dissent seems to argue that we
found viewpoint discrimination in that case because the government
excluded Christian, but not atheistic, viewpoints from being expressed
in the forum there. Post, at 2550-2551, and n. 13. The Court relied
on no such distinction in holding that discriminating against
religious speech was discriminating on the basis of viewpoint.
There is no indication in the opinion of the Court (which, unlike
an advocate's statements at oral argument, is the law) that exclusion
or inclusion of other religious or antireligious voices from that
forum had any bearing on its decision.
<P>
The University tries to escape the consequences of our holding
in Lamb's Chapel by urging that this case involves the provision
of funds rather than access to facilities. The University begins
with the unremarkable proposition that the State must have substantial
discretion in determining how to allocate scarce resources to
accomplish its educational mission. Citing our decisions in Rust
v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 111 S.Ct. 1759, 114 L.Ed.2d 233 (1991),
Regan v. Taxation with Representation of Wash., 461 U.S. 540,
103 S.Ct. 1997, 76 L.Ed.2d 129 (1983), and Widmar v. Vincent,
454 U.S. 263, 102 S.Ct. 269, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981), the University
argues that content-based funding decisions are both inevitable
and lawful. Were the reasoning of Lamb's Chapel to apply to funding
decisions as well as to those involving access to facilities,
it is urged, its holding &quot;would become a judicial juggernaut,
constitutionalizing the ubiquitous content-based decisions that
schools, colleges, and other government entities routinely make
in the allocation of public funds.&quot; Brief for Respondents
16.
<P>
To this end the University relies on our assurance in Widmar v.
Vincent, supra. There, in the course of striking down a public
university's exclusion of religious groups from use of school
facilities made available to all other student groups, we stated:
&quot;Nor do we question the right of the University to make academic
judgments as to how best to allocate scarce resources.&quot; 454
U.S., at 276, 102 S.Ct., at 277. The quoted language in Widmar
was but a proper recognition of the principle that when the State
is the speaker, it may make content-based choices. When the University
determines the content of the education it provides, it is the
University speaking, and we have permitted the government to regulate
the content of what is or is not expressed when it is the speaker
or when it enlists private entities to convey its own message.
In the same vein, in Rust v. Sullivan, *2519 supra, we upheld
the government's prohibition on abortion-related advice applicable
to recipients of federal funds for family planning counseling.
There, the government did not create a program to encourage private
speech but instead used private speakers to transmit specific
information pertaining to its own program. We recognized that
when the government appropriates public funds to promote a particular
policy of its own it is entitled to say what it wishes. 500 U.S.,
at 194, 111 S.Ct., at 1773. When the government disburses public
funds to private entities to convey a governmental message, it
may take legitimate and appropriate steps to ensure that its message
is neither garbled nor distorted by the grantee. See id., at 196-200,
111 S.Ct., at 1774-1776.
<P>
It does not follow, however, and we did not suggest in Widmar,
that viewpoint-based restrictions are proper when the University
does not itself speak or subsidize transmittal of a message it
favors but instead expends funds to encourage a diversity of views
from private speakers. A holding that the University may not discriminate
based on the viewpoint of private persons whose speech it facilitates
does not restrict the University's own speech, which is controlled
by different principles. See, e.g., Board of Ed. of Westside Community
Schools (Dist. 66) v. Mergens, 496 U.S. 226, 250, 110 S.Ct. 2356,
2372, 110 L.Ed.2d 191 (1990); Hazelwood School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier,
484 U.S. 260, 270-272, 108 S.Ct. 562, 569-570, 98 L.Ed.2d 592
(1988). For that reason, the University's reliance on Regan v.
Taxation with Representation of Wash., supra, is inapposite as
well. Regan involved a challenge to Congress' choice to grant
tax deductions for contributions made to veterans' groups engaged
in lobbying, while denying that favorable status to other charities
which pursued lobbying efforts. Although acknowledging that the
Government is not required to subsidize the exercise of fundamental
rights, see 461 U.S., at 545-546, 103 S.Ct., at 2001, we reaffirmed
the requirement of viewpoint neutrality in the Government's provision
of financial benefits by observing that &quot;[t]he case would
be different if Congress were to discriminate invidiously in its
subsidies in such a way as to 'ai[m] at the suppression of dangerous
ideas,' &quot; see id., at 548, 103 S.Ct., at 2002 (quoting Cammarano
v. United States, 358 U.S. 498, 513, 79 S.Ct. 524, 533, 3 L.Ed.2d
462 (1959), in turn quoting Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513,
519, 78 S.Ct. 1332, 1338, 2 L.Ed.2d 1460 (1958). Regan relied
on a distinction based on preferential treatment of certain speakers--veterans
organizations--and not a distinction based on the content or messages
of those groups' speech. 461 U.S., at 548, 103 S.Ct., at 2002;
cf. Perry Ed. Assn., 460 U.S., at 49, 103 S.Ct., at 957. The University's
regulation now before us, however, has a speech-based restriction
as its sole rationale and operative principle.
<P>
The distinction between the University's own favored message and
the private speech of students is evident in the case before us.
The University itself has taken steps to ensure the distinction
in the agreement each CIO must sign. See supra, at 2. The University
declares that the student groups eligible for SAF support are
not the University's agents, are not subject to its control, and
are not its responsibility. Having offered to pay the third-party
contractors on behalf of private speakers who convey their own
messages, the University may not silence the expression of selected
viewpoints.
<P>
The University urges that, from a constitutional standpoint, funding
of speech differs from provision of access to facilities because
money is scarce and physical facilities are not. Beyond the fact
that in any given case this proposition might not be true as an
empirical matter, the underlying premise that the University could
discriminate based on viewpoint if demand for space exceeded its
availability is wrong as well. The government cannot justify viewpoint
discrimination among private speakers on the economic fact of
scarcity. Had the meeting rooms in Lamb's Chapel been scarce,
had the demand been greater than the supply, our decision would
have been no different. It would have been incumbent on the State,
of course, to ration or allocate the scarce resources on some
acceptable neutral principle; but nothing in our decision indicated
that scarcity would give the State the right to *2520 exercise
viewpoint discrimination that is otherwise impermissible.
<P>
Vital First Amendment speech principles are at stake here. The
first danger to liberty lies in granting the State the power to
examine publications to determine whether or not they are based
on some ultimate idea and if so for the State to classify them.
The second, and corollary, danger is to speech from the chilling
of individual thought and expression. That danger is especially
real in the University setting, where the State acts against a
background and tradition of thought and experiment that is at
the center of our intellectual and philosophic tradition. See
Healy v. James, 408 U.S. 169, 180-181, 92 S.Ct. 2338, 2346, 33
L.Ed.2d 266 (1972); Keyishian v. Board of Regents, State Univ.
of N.Y., 385 U.S. 589, 603, 87 S.Ct. 675, 683-684, 17 L.Ed.2d
629 (1967);
<P>
Sweezy v. New Hampshire, 354 U.S. 234, 250, 77 S.Ct. 1203, 1211-1212,
1 L.Ed.2d 1311 (1957). In ancient Athens, and, as Europe entered
into a new period of intellectual awakening, in places like Bologna,
Oxford, and Paris, universities began as voluntary and spontaneous
assemblages or concourses for students to speak and to write and
to learn. See generally R. Palmer &amp; J. Colton, A History of
the Modern World 39 (7th ed. 1992). The quality and creative power
of student intellectual life to this day remains a vital measure
of a school's influence and attainment. For the University, by
regulation, to cast disapproval on particular viewpoints of its
students risks the suppression of free speech and creative inquiry
in one of the vital centers for the nation's intellectual life,
its college and university campuses.
<P>
The Guideline invoked by the University to deny third-party contractor
payments on behalf of WAP effects a sweeping restriction on student
thought and student inquiry in the context of University sponsored
publications. The prohibition on funding on behalf of publications
that &quot;primarily promot[e] or manifes[t] a particular belie[f]
in or about a deity or an ultimate reality,&quot; in its ordinary
and commonsense meaning, has a vast potential reach. The term
&quot;promotes&quot; as used here would comprehend any writing
advocating a philosophic position that rests upon a belief in
a deity or ultimate reality. See Webster's Third New International
Dictionary 1815 (1961) (defining &quot;promote&quot; as &quot;to
contribute to the growth, enlargement, or prosperity of: further,
encourage&quot;). And the term &quot;manifests&quot; would bring
within the scope of the prohibition any writing that is explicable
as resting upon a premise which presupposes the existence of a
deity or ultimate reality. See id., at 1375 (defining &quot;manifest&quot;
as &quot;to show plainly: make palpably evident or certain by
showing or displaying&quot;). Were the prohibition applied with
much vigor at all, it would bar funding of essays by hypothetical
student contributors named Plato, Spinoza, and Descartes. And
if the regulation covers, as the University says it does, see
Tr. of Oral Arg. 18-19, those student journalistic efforts which
primarily manifest or promote a belief that there is no deity
and no ultimate reality, then under-graduates named Karl Marx,
Bertrand Russell, and Jean-Paul Sartre would likewise have some
of their major essays excluded from student publications. If any
manifestation of beliefs in first principles disqualifies the
writing, as seems to be the case, it is indeed difficult to name
renowned thinkers whose writings would be accepted, save perhaps
for articles disclaiming all connection to their ultimate philosophy.
Plato could contrive perhaps to submit an acceptable essay on
making pasta or peanut butter cookies, provided he did not point
out their (necessary) imperfections.
<P>
Based on the principles we have discussed, we hold that the regulation
invoked to deny SAF support, both in its terms and in its application
to these petitioners, is a denial of their right of free speech
guaranteed by the First Amendment. It remains to be considered
whether the violation following from the University's action is
excused by the necessity of complying with the Constitution's
prohibition against state establishment of religion. We turn to
that question.
<P>
III
<P>
Before its brief on the merits in this Court, the University had
argued at all stages of the litigation that inclusion of WAP's
contractors in SAF funding authorization would violate the Establishment
Clause. Indeed, that is *2521 the ground on which the University
prevailed in the Court of Appeals. We granted certiorari on this
question: &quot;Whether the Establishment Clause compels a state
university to exclude an otherwise eligible student publication
from participation in the student activities fund, solely on the
basis of its religious viewpoint, where such exclusion would violate
the Speech and Press Clauses if the viewpoint of the publication
were nonreligious.&quot; Pet. for Cert. i. The University now
seems to have abandoned this position, contending that &quot;[t]he
fundamental objection to petitioners' argument is not that it
implicates the Establishment Clause but that it would defeat the
ability of public education at all levels to control the use of
public funds.&quot; Brief for Respondents 29; see id., at 27-29,
and n. 17; Tr. of Oral Arg. 14. That the University itself no
longer presses the Establishment Clause claim is some indication
that it lacks force; but as the Court of Appeals rested its judgment
on the point and our dissenting colleagues would find it determinative,
it must be addressed.
<P>
The Court of Appeals ruled that withholding SAF support from Wide
Awake contravened the Speech Clause of the First Amendment, but
proceeded to hold that the University's action was justified by
the necessity of avoiding a violation of the Establishment Clause,
an interest it found compelling. 18 F.3d, at 281. Recognizing
that this Court has regularly &quot;sanctioned awards of direct
nonmonetary benefits to religious groups where the government
has created open fora to which all similarly situated organizations
are invited,&quot; 18 F.3d, at 286 (citing Widmar, 454 U.S., at
277, 102 S.Ct., at 278), the Fourth Circuit asserted that direct
monetary subsidization of religious organizations and projects
is &quot;a beast of an entirely different color,&quot; 18 F.3d,
at 286. The court declared that the Establishment Clause would
not permit the use of public funds to support &quot; 'a specifically
religious activity in an otherwise substantially secular setting.'
&quot; Id., at 285 (quoting Hunt v. McNair, 413 U.S. 734, 743,
93 S.Ct. 2868, 2874, 37 L.Ed.2d 923 (1973) (emphasis deleted)).
It reasoned that because Wide Awake is &quot;a journal pervasively
devoted to the discussion and advancement of an avowedly Christian
theological and personal philosophy,&quot; the University's provision
of SAF funds for its publication would &quot;send an unmistakably
clear signal that the University of Virginia supports Christian
values and wishes to promote the wide promulgation of such values.&quot;
18 F.3d, at 286.
<P>
If there is to be assurance that the Establishment Clause retains
its force in guarding against those governmental actions it was
intended to prohibit, we must in each case inquire first into
the purpose and object of the governmental action in question
and then into the practical details of the program's operation.
Before turning to these matters, however, we can set forth certain
general principles that must bear upon our determination.
<P>
A central lesson of our decisions is that a significant factor
in upholding governmental programs in the face of Establishment
Clause attack is their neutrality towards religion. We have decided
a series of cases addressing the receipt of government benefits
where religion or religious views are implicated in some degree.
The first case in our modern Establishment Clause jurisprudence
was Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.S. 1, 67 S.Ct. 504,
91 L.Ed. 711 (1947). There we cautioned that in enforcing the
prohibition against laws respecting establishment of religion,
we must &quot;be sure that we do not inadvertently prohibit [the
government] from extending its general state law benefits to all
its citizens without regard to their religious belief.&quot; Id.,
at 16, 67 S.Ct., at 512. We have held that the guarantee of neutrality
is respected, not offended, when the government, following neutral
criteria and evenhanded policies, extends benefits to recipients
whose ideologies and viewpoints, including religious ones, are
broad and diverse. See Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School
Dist. v. Grumet, 512 U.S. ----, ----, 114 S.Ct. 2481, 2491, 129
L.Ed.2d 546 (1994) (SOUTER, J.) (&quot;[T]he principle is well
grounded in our case law [and] we have frequently relied explicitly
on the general availability of any benefit provided religious
groups or individuals in turning aside Establishment Clause challenges&quot;);

<P>
More than once have we rejected the position that the Establishment
Clause even justifies, much less requires, a refusal to extend
free speech rights to religious speakers who participate in broad-reaching
government programs neutral in design. See Lamb's Chapel, 508
U.S., at ----, 113 S.Ct., at 2147-2148; Mergens, 496 U.S., at
248, 252, 110 S.Ct., at 2370-2371, 2373; Widmar, supra, at 274-275,
102 S.Ct., at 277.
<P>
The governmental program here is neutral toward religion. There
is no suggestion that the University created it to advance religion
or adopted some ingenious device with the purpose of aiding a
religious cause. The object of the SAF is to open a forum for
speech and to support various student enterprises, including the
publication of newspapers, in recognition of the diversity and
creativity of student life. The University's SAF Guidelines have
a separate classification for, and do not make third-party payments
on behalf of, &quot;religious organizations,&quot; which are those
&quot;whose purpose is to practice a devotion to an acknowledged
ultimate reality or deity.&quot; Pet. for Cert. 66a. The category
of support here is for &quot;student news, information, opinion,
entertainment, or academic communications media groups,&quot;
of which Wide Awake was 1 of 15 in the 1990 school year. WAP did
not seek a subsidy because of its Christian editorial viewpoint;
it sought funding as a student journal, which it was.
<P>
The neutrality of the program distinguishes the student fees from
a tax levied for the direct support of a church or group of churches.
A tax of that sort, of course, would run contrary to Establishment
Clause concerns dating from the earliest days of the Republic.
The apprehensions of our predecessors involved the levying of
taxes upon the public for the sole and exclusive purpose of establishing
and supporting specific sects. The exaction here, by contrast,
is a student activity fee designed to reflect the reality that
student life in its many dimensions includes the necessity of
wide-ranging speech and inquiry and that student expression is
an integral part of the University's educational mission. The
fee is mandatory, and we do not have before us the question whether
an objecting student has the First Amendment right to demand a
pro rata return to the extent the fee is expended for speech to
which he or she does not subscribe. See Keller v. State Bar of
California, 496 U.S. 1, 15-16, 110 S.Ct. 2228, 2237, 110 L.Ed.2d
1 (1990); Abood v. Detroit Board of Ed., 431 U.S. 209, 235-236,
97 S.Ct. 1782, 1800, 52 L.Ed.2d 261 (1977). We must treat it,
then, as an exaction upon the students. But the $14 paid each
semester by the students is not a general tax designed to raise
revenue for the University. See United States v. Butler, 297 U.S.
1, 61, 56 S.Ct. 312, 317, 80 L.Ed. 477 (1936) (&quot;A tax, in
the general understanding of the term, and as used in the Constitution,
signifies an exaction for the support of the Government&quot;);
see also Head Money Cases, 112 U.S. 580, 595-596, 5 S.Ct. 247,
252, 28 L.Ed. 798 (1884). The SAF cannot be used for unlimited
purposes, much less the illegitimate purpose of supporting one
religion. Much like the arrangement in Widmar, the money goes
to a special fund from which any group of students with CIO status
can draw for purposes consistent with the University's educational
mission; and to the extent the student is interested in speech,
withdrawal is permitted to cover the whole spectrum of speech,
whether it manifests a religious view, an antireligious view,
or neither. Our decision, then, cannot be read as addressing an
expenditure from a general tax fund. Here, the disbursements from
the fund go to private contractors for the cost of printing that
which is protected under the Speech Clause of the First Amendment.
This is a far cry from a general public assessment designed and
effected to provide financial support for a church.
<P>
Government neutrality is apparent in the State's overall scheme
in a further meaningful respect. The program respects the critical
difference &quot;between government speech endorsing religion,
which the Establishment Clause forbids, and private speech endorsing
religion, which the Free Speech and Free Exercise Clauses protect.&quot;
Mergens, supra, *2523 at 250, 110 S.Ct., at 2372 (opinion of O'CONNOR,
J.). In this case, &quot;the government has not willfully fostered
or encouraged&quot; any mistaken impression that the student newspapers
speak for the University. Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd.
v. Pinette, --- U.S. ----, ----, 115 S.Ct. 2440, 2448, --- L.Ed.2d
---- (slip op., at 10). The University has taken pains to disassociate
itself from the private speech involved in this case. The Court
of Appeals' apparent concern that Wide Awake's religious orientation
would be attributed to the University is not a plausible fear,
and there is no real likelihood that the speech in question is
being either endorsed or coerced by the State, see Lee v. Weisman,
505 U.S. 577, ----, 112 S.Ct. 2649, ----, 120 L.Ed.2d 467 (1992);
Witters, supra, at 489, 106 S.Ct., at 752-753 (citing Lynch v.
Donnelly, 465 U.S. 668, 688, 104 S.Ct. 1355, 1367, 79 L.Ed.2d
604 (1984) (O'CONNOR, J., concurring)); see also Witters, supra,
at 493, 106 S.Ct., at 754-755 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in part
and concurring in judgment) (citing Lynch, supra, at 690, 104
S.Ct., at 1368 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring)).
<P>
The Court of Appeals (and the dissent) are correct to extract
from our decisions the principle that we have recognized special
Establishment Clause dangers where the government makes direct
money payments to sectarian institutions, citing Roemer v. Board
of Pub. Works of Md., 426 U.S. 736, 747, 96 S.Ct. 2337, 2345,
49 L.Ed.2d 179 (1976); Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U.S. 589, 614-615,
108 S.Ct. 2562, 2577, 101 L.Ed.2d 520 (1988); Hunt v. McNair,
413 U.S., at 742, 93 S.Ct. at 2874; Tilton, 403 U.S., at 679-680,
91 S.Ct., at 2096; Board of Ed. of Central School Dist. No. 1
v. Allen, 392 U.S. 236, 88 S.Ct. 1923, 20 L.Ed.2d 1060 (1968).
The error is not in identifying the principle but in believing
that it controls this case. Even assuming that WAP is no different
from a church and that its speech is the same as the religious
exercises conducted in Widmar (two points much in doubt), the
Court of Appeals decided a case that was, in essence, not before
it, and the dissent would have us do the same. We do not confront
a case where, even under a neutral program that includes nonsectarian
recipients, the government is making direct money payments to
an institution or group that is engaged in religious activity.
Neither the Court of Appeals nor the dissent, we believe, takes
sufficient cognizance of the undisputed fact that no public funds
flow directly to WAP's coffers.
<P>
It does not violate the Establishment Clause for a public university
to grant access to its facilities on a religion-neutral basis
to a wide spectrum of student groups, including groups which use
meeting rooms for sectarian activities, accompanied by some devotional
exercises. See Widmar, 454 U.S., at 269, 102 S.Ct., at 274; Mergens,
496 U.S., at 252, 110 S.Ct., at 2373. This is so even where the
upkeep, maintenance, and repair of the facilities attributed to
those uses is paid from a student activities fund to which students
are required to contribute. Widmar, supra, at 265, 102 S.Ct.,
at 272. The government usually acts by spending money. Even the
provision of a meeting room, as in Mergens and Widmar, involved
governmental expenditure, if only in the form of electricity and
heating or cooling costs. The error made by the Court of Appeals,
as well as by the dissent, lies in focusing on the money that
is undoubtedly expended by the government, rather than on the
nature of the benefit received by the recipient. If the expenditure
of governmental funds is prohibited whenever those funds pay for
a service that is, pursuant to a religion-neutral program, used
by a group for sectarian purposes, then Widmar, Mergens, and Lamb's
Chapel would have to be overruled. Given our holdings in these
cases, it follows that a public university may maintain its own
computer facility and give student groups access to that facility,
including the use of the printers, on a religion neutral, say
first-come-first-served, basis. If a religious student organization
obtained access on that religion-neutral basis and used a computer
to compose or a printer or copy machine to print speech with a
religious content or viewpoint, the State's action in providing
the group with access would no more violate the Establishment
Clause than would giving those groups access to an assembly hall.
See Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches School Dist., 508 U.S. ----,
113 S.Ct. 2141, 124 L.Ed.2d 352 *2524 (1993); Widmar, supra; Mergens,
supra. There is no difference in logic or principle, and no difference
of constitutional significance, between a school using its funds
to operate a facility to which students have access, and a school
paying a third-party contractor to operate the facility on its
behalf. The latter occurs here. The University provides printing
services to a broad spectrum of student newspapers qualified as
CIOs by reason of their officers and membership. Any benefit to
religion is incidental to the government's provision of secular
services for secular purposes on a religion-neutral basis. Printing
is a routine, secular, and recurring attribute of student life.
<P>
By paying outside printers, the University in fact attains a further
degree of separation from the student publication, for it avoids
the duties of supervision, escapes the costs of upkeep, repair,
and replacement attributable to student use, and has a clear record
of costs. As a result, and as in Widmar, the University can charge
the SAF, and not the taxpayers as a whole, for the discrete activity
in question. It would be formalistic for us to say that the University
must forfeit these advantages and provide the services itself
in order to comply with the Establishment Clause. It is, of course,
true that if the State pays a church's bills it is subsidizing
it, and we must guard against this abuse. That is not a danger
here, based on the considerations we have advanced and for the
additional reason that the student publication is not a religious
institution, at least in the usual sense of that term as used
in our case law, and it is not a religious organization as used
in the University's own regulations. It is instead a publication
involved in a pure forum for the expression of ideas, ideas that
would be both incomplete and chilled were the Constitution to
be interpreted to require that state officials and courts scan
the publication to ferret out views that principally manifest
a belief in a divine being.
<P>
Were the dissent's view to become law, it would require the University,
in order to avoid a constitutional violation, to scrutinize the
content of student speech, lest the expression in question--speech
otherwise protected by the Constitution--contain too great a religious
content. The dissent, in fact, anticipates such censorship as
&quot;crucial&quot; in distinguishing between &quot;works characterized
by the evangelism of Wide Awake and writing that merely happens
to express views that a given religion might approve.&quot; Post,
at 2550. That eventuality raises the specter of governmental censorship,
to ensure that all student writings and publications meet some
baseline standard of secular orthodoxy. To impose that standard
on student speech at a university is to imperil the very sources
of free speech and expression. As we recognized in Widmar, official
censorship would be far more inconsistent with the Establishment
Clause's dictates than would governmental provision of secular
printing services on a religion-blind basis.
<P>
&quot;[T]he dissent fails to establish that the distinction [between
'religious' speech and speech 'about' religion] has intelligible
content. There is no indication when 'singing hymns, reading scripture,
and teaching biblical principles' cease to be 'singing, teaching,
and reading'--all apparently forms of 'speech,' despite their
religious subject matter--and become unprotected 'worship.' ...
<P>
&quot;[E]ven if the distinction drew an arguably principled line,
it is highly doubtful that it would lie within the judicial competence
to administer. Merely to draw the distinction would require the
university--and ultimately the courts--to inquire into the significance
of words and practices to different religious faiths, and in varying
circumstances by the same faith. Such inquiries would tend inevitably
to entangle the State with religion in a manner forbidden by our
cases. E.g., Walz [v. Tax Comm'n of New York City, 397 U.S. 664,
90 S.Ct. 1409, 25 L.Ed.2d 697 (1970) ].&quot; 454 U.S., at 269-270,
n. 6, 102 S.Ct., at 274, n. 6 (citations omitted).
<P>
* * *
<P>
To obey the Establishment Clause, it was not necessary for the
University to deny eligibility to student publications because
of their viewpoint. The neutrality commanded of the State by the
separate Clauses of the First Amendment was compromised by the
*2525 University's course of action. The viewpoint discrimination
inherent in the University's regulation required public officials
to scan and interpret student publications to discern their underlying
philosophic assumptions respecting religious theory and belief.
That course of action was a denial of the right of free speech
and would risk fostering a pervasive bias or hostility to religion,
which could undermine the very neutrality the Establishment Clause
requires. There is no Establishment Clause violation in the University's
honoring its duties under the Free Speech Clause.
<P>
The judgment of the Court of Appeals must be, and is, reversed.
<P>
It is so ordered.
<P>
Justice O'CONNOR, concurring.
<P>
&quot;We have time and again held that the government generally
may not treat people differently based on the God or gods they
worship, or don't worship.&quot; Board of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village
School Dist. v. Grumet, 512 U.S. ----, ----, 114 S.Ct. 2481, 2497,
129 L.Ed.2d 546 (1994) (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in part and concurring
in judgment). This insistence on government neutrality toward
religion explains why we have held that schools may not discriminate
against religious groups by denying them equal access to facilities
that the schools make available to all. See Lamb's Chapel v. Center
Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 2141,
124 L.Ed.2d 352 (1993); Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 102 S.Ct.
269, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981). Withholding access would leave an
impermissible perception that religious activities are disfavored:
&quot;the message is one of neutrality rather than endorsement;
if a State refused to let religious groups use facilities open
to others, then it would demonstrate not neutrality but hostility
toward religion.&quot; Board of Ed. of Westside Community Schools
(Dist. 66) v. Mergens, 496 U.S. 226, 248, 110 S.Ct. 2356, 2371,
110 L.Ed.2d 191 (1990) (plurality opinion). &quot;The Religion
Clauses prohibit the government from favoring religion, but they
provide no warrant for discriminating against religion.&quot;
Kiryas Joel, supra, at ----, 114 S.Ct., at 2498 (O'CONNOR, J.).
Neutrality, in both form and effect, is one hallmark of the Establishment
Clause.
<P>
As Justice SOUTER demonstrates, however, post, at 2535-2537, there
exists another axiom in the history and precedent of the Establishment
Clause. &quot;Public funds may not be used to endorse the religious
message.&quot; Bowen v.
<P>
Kendrick, 487 U.S. 589, 642, 108 S.Ct. 2562, 2592, 101 L.Ed.2d
520 (1988)
<P>
(Blackmun, J., dissenting); see also id., at 622, 108 S.Ct., at
2581
<P>
(O'CONNOR, J., concurring). Our cases have permitted some government
funding of secular functions performed by sectarian organizations.
See, e.g., id., at 617, 108 S.Ct. at 2578 (funding for sex education);
Roemer v. Board of Pub. Works of Md., 426 U.S. 736, 741, 96 S.Ct.
2337, 2342, 49 L.Ed.2d 179 (1976)
<P>
(cash grant to colleges not to be used for &quot;sectarian purposes&quot;);
Bradfield v.
<P>
Roberts, 175 U.S. 291, 299-300, 20 S.Ct. 121, 124, 44 L.Ed. 168
(1899) (funding of health care for indigent patients). These decisions,
however, provide no precedent for the use of public funds to finance
religious activities.
<P>
This case lies at the intersection of the principle of government
neutrality and the prohibition on state funding of religious activities.
It is clear that the University has established a generally applicable
program to encourage the free exchange of ideas by its students,
an expressive marketplace that includes some 15 student publications
with predictably divergent viewpoints. It is equally clear that
petitioners' viewpoint is religious and that publication of Wide
Awake is a religious activity, under both the University's regulation
and a fair reading of our precedents. Not to finance Wide Awake,
according to petitioners, violates the principle of neutrality
by sending a message of hostility toward religion. To finance
Wide Awake, argues the University, violates the prohibition on
direct state funding of religious activities.
<P>
When two bedrock principles so conflict, understandably neither
can provide the definitive answer. Reliance on categorical platitudes
is unavailing. Resolution instead depends on the hard task of
judging--sifting through the details and determining whether *2526
the challenged program offends the Establishment Clause. Such
judgment requires courts to draw lines, sometimes quite fine,
based on the particular facts of each case. See Lee v. Weisman,
505 U.S. 577, 598, 112 S.Ct. 2649, 2661, 120 L.Ed.2d 467 (1992)
(&quot;Our jurisprudence in this area is of necessity one of line-drawing&quot;).
As Justice Holmes observed in a different context: &quot;Neither
are we troubled by the question where to draw the line. That is
the question in pretty much everything worth arguing in the law.
Day and night, youth and age are only types.&quot; Irwin v. Gavit,
268 U.S. 161, 168, 45 S.Ct. 475, 476, 69 L.Ed. 897 (1925) (citation
omitted).
<P>
In Witters v. Washington Dept. of Services for Blind, 474 U.S.
481, 106 S.Ct. 748, 88 L.Ed.2d 846 (1986), for example, we unanimously
held that the State may, through a generally applicable financial
aid program, pay a blind student's tuition at a sectarian theological
institution. The Court so held, however, only after emphasizing
that &quot;vocational assistance provided under the Washington
program is paid directly to the student, who transmits it to the
educational institution of his or her choice.&quot; Id., at 487,
106 S.Ct., at 751. The benefit to religion under the program,
therefore, is akin to a public servant contributing her government
paycheck to the church. Ibid. We thus resolved the conflict between
the neutrality principle and the funding prohibition, not by permitting
one to trump the other, but by relying on the elements of choice
peculiar to the facts of that case: &quot;The aid to religion
at issue here is the result of petitioner's private choice. No
reasonable observer is likely to draw from the facts before us
an inference that the State itself is endorsing a religious practice
or belief.&quot; Id., at 493, 106 S.Ct., at 755 (O'CONNOR, J.,
concurring in part and concurring in judgment). See also Zobrest
v. Catalina Foothills School Dist., 509 U.S. 1, ----, 113 S.Ct.
2462, 2467-2468, 125 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993).
<P>
The need for careful judgment and fine distinctions presents itself
even in extreme cases. Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.S.
1, 67 S.Ct. 504, 91 L.Ed. 711 (1947), provided perhaps the strongest
exposition of the no-funding principle: &quot;No tax in any amount,
large or small, can be levied to support any religious activities
or institutions, whatever they may be called, or whatever form
they may adopt to teach or practice religion.&quot; Id., at 16,
67 S.Ct., at 512. Yet the Court approved the use of public funds,
in a general program, to reimburse parents for their children's
bus fares to attend Catholic schools. Id., at 17-18, 67 S.Ct.,
at 512-513. Although some would cynically dismiss the Court's
disposition as inconsistent with its protestations, see id., at
19, 67 S.Ct., at 513 (Jackson, J., dissenting) (&quot;the most
fitting precedent is that of Julia who, according to Byron's reports,
'whispering &quot;I will ne'er consent,&quot;--consented' &quot;),
the decision reflected the need to rely on careful judgment--not
simple categories--when two principles, of equal historical and
jurisprudential pedigree, come into unavoidable conflict.
<P>
So it is in this case. The nature of the dispute does not admit
of categorical answers, nor should any be inferred from the Court's
decision today, see ante, at 2521. Instead, certain considerations
specific to the program at issue lead me to conclude that by providing
the same assistance to Wide Awake that it does to other publications,
the University would not be endorsing the magazine's religious
perspective.
<P>
First, the student organizations, at the University's insistence,
remain strictly independent of the University. The University's
agreement with the Contracted Independent Organizations (CIO)--i.e.,
student groups--provides:
<P>
&quot;The University is a Virginia public corporation and the
CIO is not part of that corporation, but rather exists and operates
independently of the University.... The parties understand and
agree that this Agreement is the only source of any control the
University may have over the CIO or its activities....&quot; App.
27.
<P>
And the agreement requires that student organizations include
in every letter, contract, publication, or other written materials
the following disclaimer:
<P>
*2527 &quot;Although this organization has members who are University
of Virginia students (faculty) (employees), the organization is
independent of the corporation which is the University and which
is not responsible for the organization's contracts, acts or omissions.&quot;
Id., at 28.
<P>
Any reader of Wide Awake would be on notice of the publication's
independence from the University. Cf. Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S.,
at 274, n. 14, 102 S.Ct., at 276, n. 14.
<P>
Second, financial assistance is distributed in a manner that ensures
its use only for permissible purposes. A student organization
seeking assistance must submit disbursement requests; if approved,
the funds are paid directly to the third-party vendor and do not
pass through the organization's coffers. This safeguard accompanying
the University's financial assistance, when provided to a publication
with a religious viewpoint such as Wide Awake, ensures that the
funds are used only to further the University's purpose in maintaining
a free and robust marketplace of ideas, from whatever perspective.
This feature also makes this case analogous to a school providing
equal access to a generally available printing press (or other
physical facilities), ante, at 2524, and unlike a block grant
to religious organizations.
<P>
Third, assistance is provided to the religious publication in
a context that makes improbable any perception of government endorsement
of the religious message. Wide Awake does not exist in a vacuum.
It competes with 15 other magazines and newspapers for advertising
and readership. The widely divergent viewpoints of these many
purveyors of opinion, all supported on an equal basis by the University,
significantly diminishes the danger that the message of any one
publication is perceived as endorsed by the University. Besides
the general news publications, for example, the University has
provided support to The Yellow Journal, a humor magazine that
has targeted Christianity as a subject of satire, and Al-Salam,
a publication to &quot;promote a better understanding of Islam
to the University Community,&quot; App. 92. Given this wide array
of non-religious, anti-religious and competing religious viewpoints
in the forum supported by the University, any perception that
the University endorses one particular viewpoint would be illogical.
This is not the harder case where religious speech threatens to
dominate the forum. Cf. Capitol Square Review and Advisory Bd.
v. Pinette, ante, --- U.S., at ----, 115 S.Ct., at 2451 (O'CONNOR,
J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment);
<P>
Mergens, 496 U.S., at 275, 110 S.Ct., at 2385.
<P>
Finally, although the question is not presented here, I note the
possibility that the student fee is susceptible to a Free Speech
Clause challenge by an objecting student that she should not be
compelled to pay for speech with which she disagrees. See, e.g.,
Keller v. State Bar of California, 496 U.S. 1, 15, 110 S.Ct. 2228,
2236-2237, 110 L.Ed.2d 1 (1990); Abood v. Detroit Board of Education,
431 U.S. 209, 236, 97 S.Ct. 1782, 1800, 52 L.Ed.2d 261 (1977).
There currently exists a split in the lower courts as to whether
such a challenge would be successful. Compare Hays County Guardian
v. Supple, 969 F.2d 111, 123 (CA5 1992), cert. denied 506 U.S.
----, 113 S.Ct. 1067, 122 L.Ed.2d 371 (1993); Kania v. Fordham,
702 F.2d 475, 480 (CA4 1983); Good v. Associated Students of Univ.
of Wash., 86 Wash.2d 94, 105-106, 542 P.2d 762, 769 (1975) (en
banc), with Smith v. Regents of Univ. of Cal., 4 Cal.4th 843,
863-864, 16 Cal.Rptr.2d 181, 194-195, 844 P.2d 500, 513-514, cert.
denied, 510 U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 181, 126 L.Ed.2d 140 (1993).
While the Court does not resolve the question here, see ante,
at 2522, the existence of such an opt-out possibility not available
to citizens generally, see Abood, supra, at 259, n. 13, 97 S.Ct.,
at 1811, n. 13 (Powell, J., concurring in judgment), provides
a potential basis for distinguishing proceeds of the student fees
in this case from proceeds of the general assessments in support
of religion that lie at the core of the prohibition against religious
funding, see ante, at 2521-2522; post, at 2528-2529 (THOMAS, J.,
concurring); post, at 2535-2537 (SOUTER, J., dissenting), and
from government funds generally. Unlike monies dispensed from
state or federal treasuries, the Student Activities Fund is collected
from students who themselves administer the fund and select qualifying
recipients only *2528 from among those who originally paid the
fee. The government neither pays into nor draws from this common
pool, and a fee of this sort appears conducive to granting individual
students proportional refunds. The Student Activities Fund, then,
represents not government resources, whether derived from tax
revenue, sales of assets, or otherwise, but a fund that simply
belongs to the students.
<P>
The Court's decision today therefore neither trumpets the supremacy
of the neutrality principle nor signals the demise of the funding
prohibition in Establishment Clause jurisprudence. As I observed
last Term, &quot;[e]xperience proves that the Establishment Clause,
like the Free Speech Clause, cannot easily be reduced to a single
test.&quot; Kiryas Joel, 512 U.S., at ----, 114 S.Ct., at 2499
(O'CONNOR, J., concurring in part and concurring in judgment).
<P>
When bedrock principles collide, they test the limits of categorical
obstinacy and expose the flaws and dangers of a Grand Unified
Theory that may turn out to be neither grand nor unified. The
Court today does only what courts must do in many Establishment
Clause cases--focus on specific features of a particular government
action to ensure that it does not violate the Constitution. By
withholding from Wide Awake assistance that the University provides
generally to all other student publications, the University has
discriminated on the basis of the magazine's religious viewpoint
in violation of the Free Speech Clause. And particular features
of the University's program--such as the explicit disclaimer,
the disbursement of funds directly to third-party vendors, the
vigorous nature of the forum at issue, and the possibility for
objecting students to opt out--convince me that providing such
assistance in this case would not carry the danger of impermissible
use of public funds to endorse Wide Awake's religious message.
<P>
Subject to these comments, I join the opinion of the Court.
<P>
Justice THOMAS, concurring.
<P>
I agree with the Court's opinion and join it in full, but I write
separately to express my disagreement with the historical analysis
put forward by the dissent. Although the dissent starts down the
right path in consulting the original meaning of the Establishment
Clause, its misleading application of history yields a principle
that is inconsistent with our Nation's long tradition of allowing
religious adherents to participate on equal terms in neutral government
programs.
<P>
Even assuming that the Virginia debate on the so-called &quot;Assessment
Controversy&quot; was indicative of the principles embodied in
the Establishment Clause, this incident hardly compels the dissent's
conclusion that government must actively discriminate against
religion. The dissent's historical discussion glosses over the
fundamental characteristic of the Virginia assessment bill that
sparked the controversy: The assessment was to be imposed for
the support of clergy in the performance of their function of
teaching religion. Thus, the &quot;Bill Establishing a Provision
for Teachers of the Christian Religion&quot; provided for the
collection of a specific tax, the proceeds of which were to be
appropriated &quot;by the Vestries, Elders, or Directors of each
religious society ... to a provision for a Minister or Teacher
of the Gospel of their denomination, or the providing places of
divine worship, and to none other use whatsoever.&quot; See Everson
v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.S. 1, 74, 67 S.Ct. 504, 539, 91
L.Ed. 711 (1947) (appendix to dissent of Rutledge, J.). (FN1)
<P>
*2529 James Madison's Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious
Assessments (hereinafter Madison's Remonstrance) must be understood
in this context. Contrary to the dissent's suggestion, Madison's
objection to the assessment bill did not rest on the premise that
religious entities may never participate on equal terms in neutral
government programs. Nor did Madison embrace the argument that
forms the linchpin of the dissent: that monetary subsidies are
constitutionally different from other neutral benefits programs.
Instead, Madison's comments are more consistent with the neutrality
principle that the dissent inexplicably discards. According to
Madison, the Virginia assessment was flawed because it &quot;violate[d]
that equality which ought to be the basis of every law.&quot;
Madison's Remonstrance p 4, reprinted in Everson, supra, at 66,
67 S.Ct., at 536 (appendix to dissent of Rutledge, J.). The assessment
violated the &quot;equality&quot; principle not because it allowed
religious groups to participate in a generally available government
program, but because the bill singled out religious entities for
special benefits. See ibid. (arguing that the assessment violated
the equality principle &quot;by subjecting some to peculiar burdens&quot;
and &quot;by granting to others peculiar exemptions&quot;).
<P>
Legal commentators have disagreed about the historical lesson
to take from the Assessment Controversy. For some, the experience
in Virginia is consistent with the view that the Framers saw the
Establishment Clause simply as a prohibition on governmental preferences
for some religious faiths over others. See R. Cord, Separation
of Church and State: Historical Fact and Current Fiction 20-23
(1982); Smith, Getting Off on the Wrong Foot and Back on Again:
<P>
A Reexamination of the History of the Framing of the Religion
Clauses of the First Amendment and a Critique of the Reynolds
and Everson Decisions, 20 Wake Forest L.Rev. 569, 590-591 (1984).
Other commentators have rejected this view, concluding that the
Establishment Clause forbids not only government preferences for
some religious sects over others, but also government preferences
for religion over irreligion. See, e.g., Laycock, &quot;Nonpreferential&quot;
Aid to Religion: A False Claim About Original Intent, 27 Wm. &amp;
Mary L.Rev. 875, 875 (1986).
<P>
I find much to commend the former view. Madison's focus on the
preferential nature of the assessment was not restricted to the
fourth paragraph of the Remonstrance discussed above. The funding
provided by the Virginia assessment was to be extended only to
Christian sects, and the Remonstrance seized on this defect:
<P>
&quot;Who does not see that the same authority which can establish
Christianity, in exclusion of all other Religions, may establish
with the same ease any particular sect of Christians, in exclusion
of all other Sects.&quot; Madison's Remonstrance p 3, reprinted
in Everson, supra, at 65, 67 S.Ct., at 535-536.
<P>
In addition to the third and fourth paragraphs of the Remonstrance,
&quot;Madison's seventh, *2530 ninth, eleventh, and twelfth arguments
all speak, in some way, to the same intolerance, bigotry, unenlightenment,
and persecution that had generally resulted from previous exclusive
religious establishments.&quot; Cord, supra, at 21. The conclusion
that Madison saw the principle of nonestablishment as barring
governmental preferences for particular religious faiths seems
especially clear in light of statements he made in the more-relevant
context of the House debates on the First Amendment. See Wallace
v. Jaffree, 472 U.S. 38, 98, 105 S.Ct. 2479, 2511, 86 L.Ed.2d
29 (1985) (REHNQUIST, J., dissenting) (Madison's views &quot;as
reflected by actions on the floor of the House in 1789, [indicate]
that he saw the [First] Amendment as designed to prohibit the
establishment of a national religion, and perhaps to prevent discrimination
among sects,&quot; but not &quot;as requiring neutrality on the
part of government between religion and irreligion&quot;). Moreover,
even if more extreme notions of the separation of church and state
can be attributed to Madison, many of them clearly stem from &quot;arguments
reflecting the concepts of natural law, natural rights, and the
social contract between government and a civil society,&quot;
Cord, supra, at 22, rather than the principle of nonestablishment
in the Constitution. In any event, the views of one man do not
establish the original understanding of the First Amendment.
<P>
But resolution of this debate is not necessary to decide this
case. Under any understanding of the Assessment Controversy, the
history cited by the dissent cannot support the conclusion that
the Establishment Clause &quot;categorically condemn[s] state
programs directly aiding religious activity&quot; when that aid
is part of a neutral program available to a wide array of beneficiaries.
Post, at 2539. Even if Madison believed that the principle of
nonestablishment of religion precluded government financial support
for religion per se (in the sense of government benefits specifically
targeting religion), there is no indication that at the time of
the framing he took the dissent's extreme view that the government
must discriminate against religious adherents by excluding them
from more generally available financial subsidies. (FN2)
<P>
In fact, Madison's own early legislative proposals cut against
the dissent's suggestion. In 1776, when Virginia's Revolutionary
Convention was drafting its Declaration of Rights, Madison prepared
an amendment that would have disestablished the Anglican Church.
This amendment (which went too far for the Convention and was
not adopted) is not nearly as sweeping as the dissent's version
of disestablishment; Madison merely wanted the Convention to declare
that &quot;no man or class of men ought, on account of religion[,]
to be invested with peculiar emoluments or privileges....&quot;
Madison's Amendments to the Declaration of Rights (May 29-June
12, 1776), in 1 Papers of James Madison 174 (W. Hutchinson &amp;
W. Rachal eds. 1962) (emphasis added). Likewise, Madison's Remonstrance
stressed that &quot;just government&quot; is &quot;best supported
by protecting every citizen in the enjoyment of his Religion with
the same equal hand which protects his person and his property;
by neither invading the equal rights of any Sect, nor suffering
any Sect to invade those of another.&quot; Madison's Remonstrance
p 8, reprinted in Everson, supra, at 68, 67 S.Ct., at 537; cf.
Terrett v. Taylor, 9 Cranch 43, 49, 3 L.Ed. 650 (1815) (holding
that the Virginia constitution did not prevent the government
from &quot;aiding the votaries of every sect to ... perform their
own religious duties,&quot; or from &quot;establishing funds for
the support of ministers, for public charities, for the endowment
of churches, or for the sepulture of the dead&quot; *2531 Stripped
of its flawed historical premise, the dissent's argument is reduced
to the claim that our Establishment Clause jurisprudence permits
neutrality in the context of access to government facilities but
requires discrimination in access to government funds. The dissent
purports to locate the prohibition against &quot;direct public
funding&quot; at the &quot;heart&quot; of the Establishment Clause,
see post, at 2541, but this conclusion fails to confront historical
examples of funding that date back to the time of the founding.
To take but one famous example, both Houses of the First Congress
elected chaplains, see S. Jour., 1st Cong., 1st Sess., 10 (1820
ed.); H.R. Jour., 1st Cong., 1st Sess., 26 (1826 ed.), and that
Congress enacted legislation providing for an annual salary of
$500 to be paid out of the Treasury, see Act of Sept. 22, 1789,
ch. 17, Sec. 4, 1 Stat. 70, 71. Madison himself was a member of
the committee that recommended the chaplain system in the House.
See H.R. Jour., at 11-12; 1 Annals of Cong. 891 (1789);
<P>
Cord, supra, at 25. This same system of &quot;direct public funding&quot;
of congressional chaplains has &quot;continued without interruption
ever since that early session of Congress.&quot; Marsh v. Chambers,
463 U.S. 783, 788, 103 S.Ct. 3330, 3334, 77 L.Ed.2d 1019 (1983).
(FN3)
<P>
The historical evidence of government support for religious entities
through property tax exemptions is also overwhelming. As the dissent
concedes, property tax exemptions for religious bodies &quot;have
been in place for over 200 years without disruption to the interests
represented by the Establishment Clause.&quot; Post, at 2542,
n. 7 (citing Walz v. Tax Comm'n of New York City, 397 U.S. 664,
676-680, 90 S.Ct. 1409, 1415-1417, 25 L.Ed.2d 697 (1970)). (FN4)
In my view, the dissent's acceptance of this tradition puts to
rest the notion that the Establishment Clause bars monetary aid
to religious groups even when the aid is equally available to
other groups. A tax exemption in many cases is economically and
functionally indistinguishable from a direct monetary subsidy.
(FN5) In *2532 one instance, the government relieves religious
entities (along with others) of a generally applicable tax; in
the other, it relieves religious entities (along with others)
of some or all of the burden of that tax by returning it in the
form of a cash subsidy. Whether the benefit is provided at the
front or back end of the taxation process, the financial aid to
religious groups is undeniable. The analysis under the Establishment
Clause must also be the same: &quot;Few concepts are more deeply
embedded in the fabric of our national life, beginning with pre-Revolutionary
colonial times, than for the government to exercise at the very
least this kind of benevolent neutrality toward churches and religious
exercise....&quot; Walz, supra, at 676-677, 90 S.Ct., at 1415.
<P>
Consistent application of the dissent's &quot;no-aid&quot; principle
would require that &quot; 'a church could not be protected by
the police and fire departments, or have its public sidewalk kept
in repair.' &quot; Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills School Dist.,
509 U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 2462, 2466, 125 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993)
(quoting Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 274-275, 102 S.Ct. 269,
277, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981)). The dissent admits that &quot;evenhandedness
may become important to ensuring that religious interests are
not inhibited.&quot; Post, at 2541, n. 5. Surely the dissent must
concede, however, that the same result should obtain whether the
government provides the populace with fire protection by reimbursing
the costs of smoke detectors and overhead sprinkler systems or
by establishing a public fire department. If churches may benefit
on equal terms with other groups in the latter program--that is,
if a public fire department may extinguish fires at churches--then
they may also benefit on equal terms in the former program.
<P>
Though our Establishment Clause jurisprudence is in hopeless disarray,
this case provides an opportunity to reaffirm one basic principle
that has enjoyed an uncharacteristic degree of consensus: The
Clause does not compel the exclusion of religious groups from
government benefits programs that are generally available to a
broad class of participants. See Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches
Union Free School Dist., 508 U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 2141, 124 L.Ed.2d
352 (1993); Zobrest, supra; Board of Ed. of Westside Community
Schools (Dist. 66) v. Mergens, 496 U.S. 226, 110 S.Ct. 2356, 110
L.Ed.2d 191 (1990);
<P>
Texas Monthly, Inc. v. Bullock, 489 U.S. 1, 109 S.Ct. 890, 103
L.Ed.2d 1 (1989); Witters v. Washington Dept. of Services for
Blind, 474 U.S. 481, 106 S.Ct. 748, 88 L.Ed.2d 846 (1986); Mueller
v. Allen, 463 U.S. 388, 103 S.Ct. 3062, 77 L.Ed.2d 721 (1983);
Widmar, supra. Under the dissent's view, however, the University
of Virginia may provide neutral access to the University's own
printing press, but it may not provide the same service when the
press is owned by a third party. Not surprisingly, the dissent
offers no logical justification for this conclusion, and none
is evident in the text or original meaning of the First Amendment.
<P>
If the Establishment Clause is offended when religious adherents
benefit from neutral programs such as the University of Virginia's
Student Activities Fund, it must also *2533 be offended when they
receive the same benefits in the form of in-kind subsidies. The
constitutional demands of the Establishment Clause may be judged
against either a baseline of &quot;neutrality&quot; or a baseline
of &quot;no aid to religion,&quot; but the appropriate baseline
surely cannot depend on the fortuitous circumstances surrounding
the form of aid. The contrary rule would lead to absurd results
that would jettison centuries of practice respecting the right
of religious adherents to participate on neutral terms in a wide
variety of government-funded programs.
<P>
Our Nation's tradition of allowing religious adherents to participate
in evenhanded government programs is hardly limited to the class
of &quot;essential public benefits&quot; identified by the dissent.
See post, at 2541, n. 5. A broader tradition can be traced at
least as far back as the First Congress, which ratified the Northwest
Ordinance of 1787. See Act of Aug. 7, 1789, ch. 8, 1 Stat. 50.
Article III of that famous enactment of the Confederation Congress
had provided: &quot;Religion, morality, and knowledge ... being
necessary to good government and the happiness of mankind, schools
and the means of learning shall forever be encouraged.&quot; Id.,
at 52, n. (a). Congress subsequently set aside federal lands in
the Northwest Territory and other territories for the use of schools.
See, e.g., Act of Mar. 3, 1803, ch. 21, Sec. 1, 2 Stat. 225-226;
Act of Mar. 26, 1804, ch. 35, Sec. 5, 2 Stat. 279;
<P>
Act of Feb. 15, 1811, ch. 14, Sec. 10, 2 Stat. 621; Act of Apr.
18, 1818, ch. 67, Sec. 6, 3 Stat. 430; Act of Apr. 20, 1818, ch.
126, Sec. 2, 3 Stat. 467.
<P>
Many of the schools that enjoyed the benefits of these land grants
undoubtedly were church-affiliated sectarian institutions as there
was no requirement that the schools be &quot;public.&quot; See
C. Antieau, A. Downey, &amp; E. Roberts, Freedom From Federal
Establishment, Formation and Early History of the First Amendment
Religion Clauses 163 (1964). Nevertheless, early Congresses found
no problem with the provision of such neutral benefits. See also
id., at 174 (noting that &quot;almost universally[,] Americans
from 1789 to 1825 accepted and practiced governmental aid to religion
and religiously oriented educational institutions&quot;).
<P>
Numerous other government benefits traditionally have been available
to religious adherents on neutral terms. Several examples may
be found in the work of early Congresses, including copyright
protection for &quot;the author and authors of any map, chart,
book or books,&quot; Act of May 31, 1790, ch. 15, Sec. 1, 1 Stat.
124, 124, and a privilege allowing &quot;every printer of newspapers
[to] send one paper to each and every other printer of newspapers
within the United States, free of postage,&quot; Act of Feb. 20,
1792, ch. 7, Sec. 21, 1 Stat. 232, 238. Neither of these laws
made any exclusion for the numerous authors or printers who manifested
a belief in or about a deity.
<P>
Thus, history provides an answer for the constitutional question
posed by this case, but it is not the one given by the dissent.
The dissent identifies no evidence that the Framers intended to
disable religious entities from participating on neutral terms
in evenhanded government programs. The evidence that does exist
points in the opposite direction and provides ample support for
today's decision.
<P>
Justice SOUTER, with whom Justice STEVENS, Justice GINSBURG and
Justice BREYER join, dissenting.
<P>
The Court today, for the first time, approves direct funding of
core religious activities by an arm of the State. It does so,
however, only after erroneous treatment of some familiar principles
of law implementing the First Amendment's Establishment and Speech
Clauses, and by viewing the very funds in question as beyond the
reach of the Establishment Clause's funding restrictions as such.
Because there is no warrant for distinguishing among public funding
sources for purposes of applying the First Amendment's prohibition
of religious establishment, I would hold that the University's
refusal to support petitioners' religious activities is compelled
by the Establishment Clause. I would therefore affirm.
<P>
I
<P>
The central question in this case is whether a grant from the
Student Activities Fund to pay Wide Awake's printing expenses
*2534 would violate the Establishment Clause. Although the Court
does not dwell on the details of Wide Awake's message, it recognizes
something sufficiently religious in the publication to demand
Establishment Clause scrutiny. Although the Court places great
stress on the eligibility of secular as well as religious activities
for grants from the Student Activities Fund, it recognizes that
such evenhanded availability is not by itself enough to satisfy
constitutional requirements for any aid scheme that results in
a benefit to religion. Ante, at 2521; see also ante, at 2525-2526
(O'CONNOR, J., concurring). Something more is necessary to justify
any religious aid. Some members of the Court, at least, may think
the funding permissible on a view that it is indirect, since the
money goes to Wide Awake's printer, not through Wide Awake's own
checking account. The Court's principal reliance, however, is
on an argument that providing religion with economically valuable
services is permissible on the theory that services are economically
indistinguishable from religious access to governmental speech
forums, which sometimes is permissible. But this reasoning would
commit the Court to approving direct religious aid beyond anything
justifiable for the sake of access to speaking forums. The Court
implicitly recognizes this in its further attempt to circumvent
the clear bar to direct governmental aid to religion. Different
members of the Court seek to avoid this bar in different ways.
The opinion of the Court makes the novel assumption that only
direct aid financed with tax revenue is barred, and draws the
erroneous conclusion that the involuntary Student Activities Fee
is not a tax. I do not read Justice O'CONNOR'S opinion as sharing
that assumption; she places this Student Activities Fund in a
category of student funding enterprises from which religious activities
in public universities may benefit, so long as there is no consequent
endorsement of religion. The resulting decision is in unmistakable
tension with the accepted law that the Court continues to avow.
<P>

<P>
The Court's difficulties will be all the more clear after a closer
look at Wide Awake than the majority opinion affords. The character
of the magazine is candidly disclosed on the opening page of the
first issue, where the editor-in-chief announces Wide Awake's
mission in a letter to the readership signed, &quot;Love in Christ&quot;:
it is &quot;to challenge Christians to live, in word and deed,
according to the faith they proclaim and to encourage students
to consider what a personal relationship with Jesus Christ means.&quot;
App. 45. The masthead of every issue bears St. Paul's exhortation,
that &quot;[t]he hour has come for you to awake from your slumber,
because our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed.
Romans 13:11.&quot;
<P>
Each issue of Wide Awake contained in the record makes good on
the editor's promise and echoes the Apostle's call to accept salvation:
<P>
&quot;The only way to salvation through Him is by confessing and
repenting of sin. It is the Christian's duty to make sinners aware
of their need for salvation. Thus, Christians must confront and
condemn sin, or else they fail in their duty of love.&quot; Mourad

Even featured essays on facially secular topics become platforms
from which to call readers to fulfill the tenets of Christianity
in their lives. Although a piece on racism has some general discussion
on the subject, it proceeds beyond even the analysis and interpretation

because that is the Christian thing to do:

This writing is no merely descriptive examination of religious
doctrine or even of ideal Christian practice in confronting life's
social and personal problems. Nor is it merely the expression
of editorial opinion that incidentally coincides with Christian
ethics and reflects a Christian view of human obligation. It is
straightforward exhortation to enter into a relationship with
God as revealed in Jesus Christ, and to satisfy a series of moral
obligations derived from the teachings of Jesus Christ. These
are not the words of &quot;student news, information, opinion,
entertainment, or academic communicatio[n] ...&quot; (in the language
of the University's funding criterion, App. to Pet. for Cert.
61a), but the words of &quot;challenge [to] Christians to live,
in word and deed, according to the faith they proclaim and ...
to consider what a personal relationship with Jesus Christ means&quot;
(in the language of Wide Awake's founder, App. 45). The subject
is not the discourse of the scholar's study or the seminar room,
but of the evangelist's mission station and the pulpit. It is
nothing other than the preaching of the word, which (along with
the sacraments) is what most branches of Christianity offer those
called to the religious life.
<P>
Using public funds for the direct subsidization of preaching the
word is categorically forbidden under the Establishment Clause,
and if the Clause was meant to accomplish nothing else, it was
meant to bar this use of public money. Evidence on the subject
antedates even the Bill of Rights itself, as may be seen in the
writings of Madison, whose authority on questions about the meaning
of the Establishment Clause is well settled, e.g., Committee for
Public Ed. &amp; Religious Liberty v. Nyquist, 413 U.S. 756, 770,
n. 28, 93 S.Ct. 2955, 2964, n. 28, 37 L.Ed.2d 948 (1973); Everson
v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.S. 1, 13, 67 S.Ct. 504, 510, 91
L.Ed. 711 (1947). Four years before the First Congress proposed
the First Amendment, Madison gave his opinion on the legitimacy
of using public funds for religious purposes, in the Memorial
*2536 and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments, which played
the central role in ensuring the defeat of the Virginia tax assessment
bill in 1786 and framed the debate upon which the Religion Clauses
stand:
<P>
&quot;Who does not see that ... the same authority which can force
a citizen to contribute three pence only of his property for the
support of any one establishment, may force him to conform to
any other establishment in all cases whatsoever?&quot; James Madison,
Memorial and Remonstrance Against Religious Assessments p 3 (hereinafter
Madison's Remonstrance), reprinted in Everson, supra, at 65-66
[67 S.Ct., at 524] (appendix to dissent of Rutledge, J.).
<P>
Madison wrote against a background in which nearly every Colony
had exacted a tax for church support, Everson, supra, at 10, n.
8, 67 S.Ct., at 509, n. 8, the practice having become &quot;so
commonplace as to shock the freedom-loving colonials into a feeling
of abhorrence,&quot; 330 U.S., at 11, 67 S.Ct., at 509 (footnote
omitted). Madison's Remonstrance captured the colonists' &quot;conviction
that individual religious liberty could be achieved best under
a government which was stripped of all power to tax, to support,
or otherwise to assist any or all religions, or to interfere with
the beliefs of any religious individual or group.&quot; Ibid.
(FN1) Their sentiment as expressed by Madison in Virginia, led
not only *2537 to the defeat of Virginia's tax assessment bill,
but also directly to passage of the Virginia Bill for Establishing
Religious Freedom, written by Thomas Jefferson. That bill's preamble
declared that &quot;to compel a man to furnish contributions of
money for the propagation of opinions which he disbelieves, is
sinful and tyrannical,&quot; Jefferson, A Bill for Establishing
Religious Freedom, reprinted in 5 The Founder's Constitution 84-85
(P. Kurland &amp; R. Lerner eds. 1987), and its text provided
&quot;[t]hat no man shall be compelled to frequent or support
any religious worship, place, or ministry whatsoever....,&quot;
ibid. See generally Everson, supra, at 13, 67 S.Ct., at 510. We
have &quot;previously recognized that the provisions of the First
Amendment, in the drafting and adoption of which Madison and Jefferson
played such leading roles, had the same objective and were intended
to provide the same protection against governmental intrusion
on religious liberty as the Virginia statute.&quot;

support for religion.... They did not substitute small taxes for
large taxes; three pence was as bad as any larger sum. The principle
was what mattered. With respect to money, religion was to be wholly
voluntary. Churches either would support themselves or they would
not, but the government would neither help nor interfere&quot;)

<P>
*2538 The principle against direct funding with public money is
patently violated by the contested use of today's student activity
fee. (FN3) Like today's taxes generally, the fee is Madison's
threepence. The University exercises the power of the State to
compel a student to pay it, see Jefferson's Preamble, supra, and
the use of any part of it for the direct support of religious
activity thus strikes at what we have repeatedly held to be the
heart of the prohibition on establishment. Everson, 330 U.S.,
at 15-16, 67 S.Ct., at 511 (&quot;The 'establishment of religion
clause' ... means at least this.... No tax in any amount, large
or small, can be levied to support any religious activities or
institutions, whatever they may be called, or whatever form they
may adopt to teach or practice religion&quot;); see School Dist.

taxing and spending power would be used to favor one religion
over another or to support religion in general&quot;).
<P>
The Court, accordingly, has never before upheld direct state funding
of the sort of proselytizing published in Wide Awake and, in fact,
has categorically condemned state programs directly aiding religious
activity, School Dist. v. Ball, supra, at 395, 105 S.Ct., at 3228-3229
(striking programs providing secular instruction to nonpublic
school students on nonpublic school premises because they are

the Establishment Clause&quot;); Wolman v. Walter, 433 U.S. 229,
254, 97 S.Ct. 2593, 2608-2609, 53 L.Ed.2d 714 (1977) (striking

<P>
Even when the Court has upheld aid to an institution performing
both secular and sectarian functions, it has always made a searching
enquiry to ensure that the institution kept the secular activities
separate from its sectarian ones, with any direct aid flowing
only to the former and never the latter. Bowen v. Kendrick, 487

limited to secular books requested by individual students for
secular educational purposes).
<P>
Reasonable minds may differ over whether the Court reached the
correct result in each of these cases, but their common principle
has never been questioned or repudiated. &quot;Although Establishment
Clause jurisprudence is characterized by few absolutes, the Clause
does absolutely prohibit government-financed ... indoctrination
into the beliefs of a particular religious faith.&quot; School
Dist. v. Ball, 473 U.S., at 385, 105 S.Ct., at 3223.
<P>
B
<P>
Why does the Court not apply this clear law to these clear facts
and conclude, as I do, that the funding scheme here is a clear
constitutional *2540 violation? The answer must be in part that
the Court fails to confront the evidence set out in the preceding
section. Throughout its opinion, the Court refers uninformatively
to Wide Awake's &quot;Christian viewpoint,&quot; ante, at 2515,
or its &quot;religious perspective,&quot; ante, at 2518, and in
distinguishing funding of Wide Awake from the funding of a church,
the Court maintains that &quot;[Wide Awake] is not a religious
institution, at least in the usual sense,&quot; ante, at 2524;
(FN4) see also ante, at 2515. The Court does not quote the magazine's
adoption of Saint Paul's exhortation to awaken to the nearness
of salvation, or any of its articles enjoining readers to accept
Jesus Christ, or the religious verses, or the religious textual
analyses, or the suggested prayers. And so it is easy for the
Court to lose sight of what the University students and the Court
of Appeals found so obvious, and to blanch the patently and frankly
evangelistic character of the magazine by unrevealing allusions
to religious points of view.
<P>
Nevertheless, even without the encumbrance of detail from Wide
Awake's actual pages, the Court finds something sufficiently religious
about the magazine to require examination under the Establishment
Clause, and one may therefore ask why the unequivocal prohibition
on direct funding does not lead the Court to conclude that funding
would be unconstitutional. The answer is that the Court focuses
on a subsidiary body of law, which it correctly states but ultimately
misapplies. That subsidiary body of law accounts for the Court's
substantial attention to the fact that the University's funding
scheme is &quot;neutral,&quot; in the formal sense that it makes
funds available on an evenhanded basis to secular and sectarian
applicants alike. Ante, at 2521-2522. While this is indeed true
and relevant under our cases, it does not alone satisfy the requirements
of the Establishment Clause, as the Court recognizes when it says
that evenhandedness is only a &quot;significant factor&quot; in
certain Establishment Clause analysis, not a dispositive one.
Ante, at 2521; see ante, at 2521-2522; see also ante, at 2525-2526
(O'CONNOR, J., concurring); id., at 2525 (&quot;Neutrality, in
both form and effect, is one hallmark of the Establishment Clause&quot;);
Capitol Square Review and Advisory Board v. Pinette, --- U.S.
----, ----, 115 S.Ct. 2440, ----, --- L.Ed.2d ---- (O'CONNOR,
J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (&quot;the
Establishment Clause forbids a State from hiding behind the application
of formally neutral criteria and remaining studiously oblivious
to the effects of its actions.... [N]ot all State policies are
permissible under the Religion Clauses simply because they are
neutral in form&quot;). This recognition reflects the Court's
appreciation of two general rules: that whenever affirmative government
aid ultimately benefits religion, the Establishment Clause requires
some justification beyond evenhandedness on the government's part;
and that direct public funding of core sectarian activities, even
if accomplished pursuant to an evenhanded program, would be entirely
inconsistent with the Establishment Clause and would strike at
the very heart of the Clause's protection. See ante, at 2523 (&quot;We
do not confront a case where, even under a neutral program that
includes nonsectarian recipients, the government is making direct
money payments to an institution or group that is engaged in religious
activity&quot;); ante, at 2522, 2523-2524; see also ante, at ----
(O'CONNOR, J., concurring) (&quot;[Our] decisions ... provide
no precedent for the use of public funds to finance religious
activities&quot;).
<P>
In order to understand how the Court thus begins with sound rules
but ends with an unsound result, it is necessary to explore those
rules in greater detail than the Court does. As the foregoing
quotations from the Court's opinion indicate, the relationship
between the prohibition on direct aid and the requirement of evenhandedness
when affirmative government aid does result in some benefit to
religion reflects the relationship between basic rule and marginal
criterion. *2541 At the heart of the Establishment Clause stands
the prohibition against direct public funding, but that prohibition
does not answer the questions that occur at the margins of the
Clause's application. Is any government activity that provides
any incidental benefit to religion likewise unconstitutional?
Would it be wrong to put out fires in burning churches, wrong
to pay the bus fares of students on the way to parochial schools,
wrong to allow a grantee of special education funds to spend them
at a religious college? These are the questions that call for
drawing lines, and it is in drawing them that evenhandedness becomes
important. However the Court may in the past have phrased its
line-drawing test, the question whether such benefits are provided
on an evenhanded basis has been relevant, for the question addresses
one aspect of the issue whether a law is truly neutral with respect
to religion (that is, whether the law either &quot;advance[s]
[or] inhibit[s] religion,&quot; Allegheny County v. Greater Pittsburgh
Chapter, American Civil Liberties Union, 492 U.S. 573, 592, 109
S.Ct. 3086, 3100, 106 L.Ed.2d 472 (1989)). In Widmar v. Vincent,
454 U.S. 263, 274, 102 S.Ct. 269, 276, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981),
for example, we noted that &quot;[t]he provision of benefits to
[a] broad ... spectrum of [religious and nonreligious] groups
is an important index of secular effect.&quot; See also Board
of Ed. of Kiryas Joel Village School Dist. v. Grumet, 512 U.S.
----, ----, 114 S.Ct. 2481, 2491-2492, 129 L.Ed.2d 546 (1994).
In the doubtful cases (those not involving direct public funding),
where there is initially room for argument about a law's effect,
evenhandedness serves to weed out those laws that impermissibly
advance religion by channelling aid to it exclusively. Evenhandedness
is therefore a prerequisite to further enquiry into the constitutionality
of a doubtful law, (FN5) but evenhandedness goes no further. It
does not guarantee success under Establishment Clause scrutiny.
<P>
Three cases permitting indirect aid to religion, Mueller v. Allen,
463 U.S. 388, 103 S.Ct. 3062, 77 L.Ed.2d 721 (1983), Witters v.
Washington Dept. of Services for Blind, 474 U.S. 481, 106 S.Ct.
748, 88 L.Ed.2d 846 (1986), and Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills
School Dist., 509 U.S. 1, 113 S.Ct. 2462, 125 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993),
are among the latest of those to illustrate this relevance of
evenhandedness when advancement is not so obvious as to be patently
unconstitutional. Each case involved a program in which benefits
given to individuals on a religion-neutral basis ultimately were
used by the individuals, in one way or another, to support religious
institutions. (FN6)
<P>
In each, the fact that aid was distributed generally and on a
neutral basis was a necessary condition for upholding the program
at issue. Witters, supra, at 487-488, 106 S.Ct., at 751; Mueller,
supra, at 397-399, 103 S.Ct. at 3068-3069; Zobrest, supra, at
---- - ----, 113 S.Ct., at 2467-2468. But the significance of
evenhandedness stopped there. We did not, in any of these cases,
hold that satisfying the condition was sufficient, or dispositive.
Even more importantly, we never held that evenhandedness might
be sufficient to render direct aid to religion constitutional.
Quite the contrary. Critical to our decisions in these cases was
the fact that the aid was indirect; it reached religious institutions
&quot;only as a result of the genuinely independent and private
choices of aid recipients,&quot; Witters, supra, at 487, 106 S.Ct.,
at 752; see also Mueller, supra, at 399-400, 103 S.Ct., at 3069-3070;
Zobrest, supra, at ---- - ----, 113 S.Ct., at 2468-2469. In noting
and relying on this particular feature of each of the programs
at issue, we in fact reaffirmed the core prohibition on direct
funding of religious activities. *2542 See Zobrest, supra, at
---- - ----, 113 S.Ct., at 2468-2469; Witters, supra, at 487,
106 S.Ct., at 752; see also Mueller, supra, at 399-400, 103 S.Ct.,
at 3069-3070. Thus, our holdings in these cases were little more
than extensions of the unremarkable proposition that &quot;a State
may issue a paycheck to one of its employees, who may then donate
all or part of that paycheck to a religious institution, all without
constitutional barrier....&quot; Witters, supra, at 486-487, 106
S.Ct., at 751. Such &quot;attenuated financial benefit[s], ultimately
controlled by the private choices of individual[s],&quot; we have
found, are simply not within the contemplation of the Establishment
Clause's broad prohibition. Mueller, supra, at 400, 103 S.Ct.,
at 3069-3070; see also Witters, supra, at 493, 106 S.Ct., at 754-755
(opinion of O'CONNOR, J.). (FN7)
<P>
Evenhandedness as one element of a permissibly attenuated benefit
is, of course, a far cry from evenhandedness as a sufficient condition
of constitutionality for direct financial support of religious
proselytization, and our cases have unsurprisingly repudiated
any such attempt to cut the Establishment Clause down to a mere
prohibition against unequal direct aid. See, e.g., Tilton v. Richardson,
403 U.S., at 682-684, 91 S.Ct., at 2097-2099 (striking portion
of general aid program providing grants for construction of college
and university facilities to the extent program made possible
the use of funds for sectarian activities); (FN8) Wolman v. Walter,
433 U.S., at 252-255, 97 S.Ct., at 2608-09 (striking funding of
field trips for nonpublic school students, such as are &quot;provided
to public *2543 school students in the district,&quot; because
of unacceptable danger that state funds would be used to foster
religion). And nowhere has the Court's adherence to the preeminence
of the no-direct-funding principle over the principle of evenhandedness
been as clear as in Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U.S. 589, 108 S.Ct.
2562, 101 L.Ed.2d 520.
<P>
Bowen involved consideration of the Adolescent Family Life Act
(AFLA), a federal grant program providing funds to institutions
for counseling and educational services related to adolescent
sexuality and pregnancy. At the time of the litigation, 141 grants
had been awarded under the AFLA to a broad array of both secular
and religiously affiliated institutions. Id., at 597, 108 S.Ct.,
at 2567-2568. In an Establishment Clause challenge to the Act
brought by taxpayers and other interested parties, the District
Court resolved the case on a pre-trial motion for summary judgment,
holding the AFLA program unconstitutional both on its face and
also insofar as religious institutions were involved in receiving
grants under the Act. When this Court reversed on the issue of
facial constitutionality under the Establishment Clause, id.,
at 602-618, 108 S.Ct., at 2570-2579, we said that there was &quot;no
intimation in the statute that at some point, or for some grantees,
religious uses are permitted.&quot; Id., at 614, 108 S.Ct., at
2577. On the contrary, after looking at the legislative history
and applicable regulations, we found safeguards adequate to ensure
that grants would not be &quot;used by ... grantees in such a
way as to advance religion.&quot; Id., at 615, 108 S.Ct., at 2577.
<P>
With respect to the claim that the program was unconstitutional
as applied, we remanded the case to the District Court &quot;for
consideration of the evidence presented by appellees insofar as
it sheds light on the manner in which the statute is presently
being administered.&quot; Id., at 621, 108 S.Ct., at 2580.
<P>
Specifically, we told the District Court, on remand, to &quot;consider
... whether in particular cases AFLA aid has been used to fund
'specifically religious activit[ies] in an otherwise substantially
secular setting.' &quot; Ibid., quoting Hunt v. McNair, 413 U.S.,
at 743, 93 S.Ct., at 2874. In giving additional guidance to the
District Court, we suggested that application of the Act would
be unconstitutional if it turned out that aid recipients were
using materials &quot;that have an explicitly religious content
or are designed to inculcate the views of a particular religious
faith.&quot; Ibid. At no point in our opinion did we suggest that
the breadth of potential recipients, or distribution on an evenhanded
basis, could have justified the use of federal funds for religious
activities, a position that would have made no sense after we
had pegged the Act's facial constitutionality to our conclusion
that advancement of religion was not inevitable. Justice O'CONNOR's
separate opinion in the case underscored just this point: &quot;I
fully agree ... that '[p]ublic funds may not be used to endorse
the religious message.' Post, at 642, 108 S.Ct., at 2591-2592
[ (Blackmun, J., dissenting) ].... [A]ny use of public funds to
promote religious doctrines violates the Establishment Clause.&quot;
Id., at 622-623, 108 S.Ct., at 2581-582 (concurring opinion) (emphasis
in original).
<P>
Bowen was no sport; its pedigree was the line of Everson v. Board
of Ed., 330 U.S., at 16-18, 67 S.Ct., at 511-513, Board of Ed.
v. Allen, 392 U.S., at 243-249, 88 S.Ct., at 1926-1930, Tilton
v. Richardson, 403 U.S., at 678-682, 91 S.Ct., at 2095-2098, Hunt
v. McNair, 413 U.S., at 742-745, 93 S.Ct., at 2873-2875, and Roemer
v. Board of Pub. Works of Md., 426 U.S., at 759-761, 96 S.Ct.,
at 2351-2352. Each of these cases involved a general aid program
that provided benefits to a broad array of secular and sectarian
institutions on an evenhanded basis, but in none of them was that
fact dispositive. The plurality opinion in Roemer made this point
exactly:
<P>
&quot;The Court has taken the view that a secular purpose and
a facial neutrality may not be enough, if in fact the State is
lending direct support to a religious activity. The State may
not, for example, pay for what is actually a religious education,
even though it purports to be paying for a secular one, and even
though it makes its aid available to secular and religious institutions
alike.&quot; 426 U.S., at 747, 96 S.Ct., at 2345 (opinion of Blackmun,
J.).
<P>
Instead, the central enquiry in each of these general aid cases,
as in Bowen, was whether *2544 secular activities could be separated
from the sectarian ones sufficiently to ensure that aid would
flow to the secular alone.
<P>
Witters, Mueller, and Zobrest expressly preserve the standard
thus exhibited so often. Each of these cases explicitly distinguished
the indirect aid in issue from contrasting examples in the line
of cases striking down direct aid, and each thereby expressly
preserved the core constitutional principle that direct aid to
religion is impermissible. See Zobrest, supra, at ---- - ----,
113 S.Ct., at 2468-2469 (distinguishing Meek v. Pittenger, 421
U.S. 349, 95 S.Ct. 1753, 44 L.Ed.2d 217 and School Dist. v. Ball,
473 U.S. 373, 105 S.Ct. 3216, 87 L.Ed.2d 267, and noting that
&quot; '[t]he state may not grant aid to a religious school, whether
cash or in kind, where the effect of the aid is that of a direct
subsidy to the religious school' &quot;) (quoting Witters, 474
U.S., at 487, 106 S.Ct., at 751); see also ibid.; Mueller, 463
U.S., at 399, 103 S.Ct., at 3069. It appears that the University
perfectly understood the primacy of the no-direct-funding rule
over the evenhandedness principle when it drew the line short
of funding &quot;any activity which primarily promotes or manifests
a particular belief(s) in or about a deity or an ultimate reality.&quot;
(FN9) App. to Pet. for Cert. 66a.
<P>
C
<P>
Since conformity with the marginal or limiting principle of evenhandedness
is insufficient of itself to demonstrate the constitutionality
of providing a government benefit that reaches religion, the Court
must identify some further element in the funding scheme that
does demonstrate its permissibility. For one reason or another,
the Court's chosen element appears to be the fact that under the
University's Guidelines, funds are sent to the printer chosen
by Wide Awake, rather than to Wide Awake itself. Ante, at 2523-2524.
<P>

<P>
If the Court's suggestion is that this feature of the funding
program brings this case into line with Witters, Mueller, and
Zobrest (discussed supra, at 2521-2522), the Court has misread
those cases, which turned on the fact that the choice to benefit
religion was made by a non-religious third party standing between
the government and a religious institution. See Witters, 474 U.S.,
at 487, 106 S.Ct., at 751; see also Mueller, 463 U.S., at 399-400,
103 S.Ct., at 3069-3070; Zobrest, *2545 509 U.S., at ---- - ----,
113 S.Ct., at 2467-2469. Here there is no third party standing
between the government and the ultimate religious beneficiary
to break the circuit by its independent discretion to put state
money to religious use. The printer, of course, has no option
to take the money and use it to print a secular journal instead
of Wide Awake. It only gets the money because of its contract
to print a message of religious evangelism at the direction of
Wide Awake, and it will receive payment only for doing precisely
that. The formalism of distinguishing between payment to Wide
Awake so it can pay an approved bill and payment of the approved
bill itself cannot be the basis of a decision of Constitutional
law. If this indeed were a critical distinction, the Constitution
would permit a State to pay all the bills of any religious institution;
(FN10) in fact, despite the Court's purported adherence to the
no-direct-funding principle, the State could simply hand out credit
cards to religious institutions and honor the monthly statements
(so long as someone could devise an evenhanded umbrella to cover
the whole scheme). Witters and the other cases cannot be distinguished
out of existence this way.
<P>
2
<P>
It is more probable, however, that the Court's reference to the
printer goes to a different attempt to justify the payment. On
this purported justification, the payment to the printer is significant
only as the last step in an argument resting on the assumption
that a public university may give a religious group the use of
any of its equipment or facilities so long as secular groups are
likewise eligible. The Court starts with the cases of Widmar v.
Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 102 S.Ct. 269, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981), Board
of Ed. of Westside Community Schools v. Mergens, 496 U.S. 226,
110 S.Ct. 2356, 110 L.Ed.2d 191 (1990), and Lamb's Chapel v. Center
Moriches Union Free School Dist., 508 U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 2141,
124 L.Ed.2d 352 (1993), in which religious groups were held to
be entitled to access for speaking in government buildings open
generally for that purpose. The Court reasons that the availability
of a forum has economic value (the government built and maintained
the building, while the speakers saved the rent for a hall); and
that economically there is no difference between the University's
provision of the value of the room and the value, say, of the
University's printing equipment; and that therefore the University
must be able to provide the use of the latter. Since it may do
that, the argument goes, it would be unduly formalistic to draw
the line at paying for an outside printer, who simply does what
the magazine's publishers could have done with the University's
own printing equipment. Ante, at 2523-2524.
<P>
The argument is as unsound as it is simple, and the first of its
troubles emerges from an examination of the cases relied upon
to support it. The common factual thread running through Widmar,
Mergens, and Lamb's Chapel, is that a governmental institution
created a limited forum for the use of students in a school or
college, or for the public at large, but sought to exclude speakers
with religious messages. See generally Perry Ed. Assn. v. Perry
Local Educators' Assn., 460 U.S. 37, 45-46, 103 S.Ct. 948, 954-955,
74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983) (forum analysis). In each case the restriction
was struck down either as an impermissible attempt to regulate
the content of speech in an open forum (as in Widmar and Mergens)
or to suppress a particular religious viewpoint (as in Lamb's
Chapel, see infra, at 2550-2551). In each case, to be sure, the
religious speaker's use of the room passed muster as an incident
of a plan to facilitate speech generally for a secular purpose,
entailing neither secular entanglement with religion nor risk
that the religious speech would be taken to be the speech *2546
of the government or that the government's endorsement of a religious
message would be inferred. But each case drew ultimately on unexceptionable
Speech Clause doctrine treating the evangelist, the Salvation
Army, the millennialist or the Hare Krishna like any other speaker
in a public forum. It was the preservation of free speech on the
model of the street corner that supplied the justification going
beyond the requirement of evenhandedness.
<P>
The Court's claim of support from these forum-access cases is
ruled out by the very scope of their holdings. While they do indeed
allow a limited benefit to religious speakers, they rest on the
recognition that all speakers are entitled to use the street corner
(even though the State paves the roads and provides police protection
to everyone on the street) and on the analogy between the public
street corner and open classroom space. Thus, the Court found
it significant that the classroom speakers would engage in traditional
speech activities in these forums, too, even though the rooms
(like street corners) require some incidental state spending to
maintain them. The analogy breaks down entirely, however, if the
cases are read more broadly than the Court wrote them, to cover
more than forums for literal speaking. There is no traditional
street corner printing provided by the government on equal terms
to all comers, and the forum cases cannot be lifted to a higher
plane of generalization without admitting that new economic benefits
are being extended directly to religion in clear violation of
the principle barring direct aid. The argument from economic equivalence
thus breaks down on recognizing that the direct state aid it would
support is not mitigated by the street corner analogy in the service
of free speech. Absent that, the rule against direct aid stands
as a bar to printing services as well as printers.
<P>
3
<P>
It must, indeed, be a recognition of just this point that leads
the Court to take a third tack, not in coming up with yet a third
attempt at justification within the rules of existing case law,
but in recasting the scope of the Establishment Clause in ways
that make further affirmative justification unnecessary. Justice
O'CONNOR makes a comprehensive analysis of the manner in which
the activity fee is assessed and distributed. She concludes that
the funding differs so sharply from religious funding out of governmental
treasuries generally that it falls outside Establishment Clause's
purview in the absence of a message of religious endorsement (which
she finds not to be present). Ante, at 2526-2528 (O'CONNOR, J.,
concurring). The opinion of the Court concludes more expansively
that the activity fee is not a tax, and then proceeds to find
the aid permissible on the legal assumption that the bar against
direct aid applies only to aid derived from tax revenue. I have
already indicated why it is fanciful to treat the fee as anything
but a tax, supra, at 2538, and n. 3; see also ante, at 2522 (noting
mandatory nature of the fee), and will not repeat the point again.
The novelty of the assumption that the direct aid bar only extends
to aid derived from taxation, however, requires some response.
<P>
Although it was a taxation scheme that moved Madison to write
in the first instance, the Court has never held that government
resources obtained without taxation could be used for direct religious
support, and our cases on direct government aid have frequently
spoken in terms in no way limited to tax revenues. E.g., School
Dist. v. Ball, 473 U.S., at 385, 105 S.Ct., at 3223 (&quot;Although
Establishment Clause jurisprudence is characterized by few absolutes,
the Clause does absolutely prohibit government-financed or government-sponsored
indoctrination into the beliefs of a particular religious faith&quot;);
Nyquist, 413 U.S., at 780, 93 S.Ct., at 2969 (&quot;In the absence
of an effective means of guaranteeing that the state aid derived
from public funds will be used exclusively for secular, neutral,
and nonideological purposes, it is clear from our cases that direct
aid in whatever form is invalid&quot;); id., at 772, 93 S.Ct.,
at 2965 (&quot;Primary among those evils&quot; against which the
Establishment Clause guards &quot;have been sponsorship, financial
support, and active involvement of the sovereign in religious
activity&quot;) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted);
see also T. Curry, The First Freedoms 217 (1986) (At the time
*2547 of the framing of the Bill of Rights, &quot;[t]he belief
that government assistance to religion, especially in the form
of taxes, violated religious liberty had a long history&quot;).
<P>
Allowing non-tax funds to be spent on religion would, in fact,
fly in the face of clear principle. Leaving entirely aside the
question whether public non-tax revenues could ever be used to
finance religion without violating the endorsement test, see Allegheny
County v. American Civil Liberties Union, 492 U.S., at 593-594,
109 S.Ct., at 3100-3101, any such use of them would ignore one
the dual objectives of the Establishment Clause, which was meant
not only to protect individuals and their republics from the destructive
consequences of mixing government and religion, but to protect
religion from a corrupting dependence on support from the Government.
Engel v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421, 431, 82 S.Ct. 1261, 1267, 8 L.Ed.2d
601 (1962) (the Establishment Clause's &quot;first and most immediate
purpose rested on the belief that a union of government and religion
tends to destroy government and to degrade religion&quot;); Everson,
330 U.S., at 53, 67 S.Ct., at 529-530 (Rutledge, J., dissenting)
(&quot;The great condition of religious liberty is that it be
maintained free from sustenance, as also from other interferences,
by the state. For when it comes to rest upon that secular foundation
it vanishes with the resting&quot;) (citing Madison's Remonstrance
pp 7, 8, reprinted in Everson, supra, at 63-72, 67 S.Ct., at 534-539
(appendix to dissent of Rutledge, J.)); School Dist. of Abington
v. Schempp, 374 U.S. 203, 259, 83 S.Ct. 1560, 1591, 10 L.Ed.2d
844 (1963) (Brennan, J., concurring) (&quot;It is not only the
nonbeliever who fears the injection of sectarian doctrines and
controversies into the civil polity, but in as high degree it
is the devout believer who fears the secularization of a creed
which becomes too deeply involved with and dependent upon the
government&quot;) (footnote omitted); Jefferson, A Bill for Establishing
Religious Freedom, reprinted in 5 The Founder's Constitution,
at 84-85. Since the corrupting effect of government support does
not turn on whether the Government's own money comes from taxation
or gift or the sale of public lands, the Establishment Clause
could hardly relax its vigilance simply because tax revenue was
not implicated. Accordingly, in the absence of a forthright disavowal,
one can only assume that the Court does not mean to eliminate
one half of the Establishment Clause's justification.
<P>
D
<P>
Nothing in the Court's opinion would lead me to end this enquiry
into the application of the Establishment Clause any differently
from the way I began it. The Court is ordering an instrumentality
of the State to support religious evangelism with direct funding.
This is a flat violation of the Establishment Clause.
<P>
II
<P>
Given the dispositive effect of the Establishment Clause's bar
to funding the magazine, there should be no need to decide whether
in the absence of this bar the University would violate the Free
Speech Clause by limiting funding as it has done. Widmar, 454
U.S., at 271, 102 S.Ct., at 275 (university's compliance with
its Establishment Clause obligations can be a compelling interest
justifying speech restriction). But the Court's speech analysis
may have independent application, and its flaws should not pass
unremarked.
<P>
The Court acknowledges, ante, at 2518, the necessity for a university
to make judgments based on the content of what may be said or
taught when it decides, in the absence of unlimited amounts of
money or other resources, how to honor its educational responsibilities.
Widmar, supra, at 276, 102 S.Ct., at 277-278; cf. Perry, 460 U.S.,
at 49, 103 S.Ct., at 957 (subject matter and speaker identity
distinctions &quot;are inherent and inescapable in the process
of limiting a non-public forum to activities compatible with the
intended purpose of the property&quot;). Nor does the Court generally
question that in allocating public funds a state university enjoys
spacious discretion. Cf. Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 194,
111 S.Ct. 1759, 1773, 114 L.Ed.2d 233 (1991)
<P>
(&quot;[W]hen the government appropriates public funds to establish
a program it is entitled to define the limits of that program&quot;);
Regan v. Taxation *2548 with Representation of Wash., 461 U.S.
540, 103 S.Ct. 1997, 76 L.Ed.2d 129 (1983) (upholding government
subsidization decision partial to one class of speaker). (FN11)
Accordingly, the Court recognizes that the relevant enquiry in
this case is not merely whether the University bases its funding
decisions on the subject matter of student speech; if there is
an infirmity in the basis for the University's funding decision,
it must be that the University is impermissibly distinguishing
among competing viewpoints, ante, at 2516-2517, citing, inter
alia, Perry, supra, at 46, 103 S.Ct., at 957; see also Lamb's
Chapel, 508 U.S. at ----, 113 S.Ct. at 2144-2145 (subject matter
distinctions permissible in controlling access to limited public
forum if reasonable and viewpoint neutral); Cornelius v. NAACP
Legal Defense &amp; Ed. Fund, Inc., 473 U.S. 788, 806, 105 S.Ct.
3439, 3451, 87 L.Ed.2d 567 (1985) (similar); Regan, supra, at
548, 103 S.Ct., at 2002. (FN12)
<P>
The issue whether a distinction is based on viewpoint does not
turn simply on whether a government regulation happens to be applied
to a speaker who seeks to advance a particular viewpoint; the
issue, of course, turns on whether the burden on speech is explained
by reference to viewpoint. See Cornelius, supra, at 806, 105 S.Ct.,
at 3439 (&quot;[T]he government violates the First Amendment when
it denies access to a speaker solely to suppress the point of
view he espouses on an otherwise includible subject&quot;). As
when deciding whether a speech restriction is content-based or
content-neutral, &quot;[t]he government's purpose is the controlling
consideration.&quot; Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781,
791, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 2754, 105 L.Ed.2d 661 (1989); see also ibid.
(content neutrality turns on, inter alia, whether a speech restriction
is &quot;justified without reference to the content of the regulated
speech&quot;) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).
So, for example, a city that enforces its excessive noise ordinance
by pulling the plug on a rock band using a forbidden amplification
system is not guilty of viewpoint discrimination simply because
the band wishes to use that equipment to espouse antiracist views.
Accord, Rock Against Racism, supra. Nor does a municipality's
decision to prohibit political advertising on bus placards amount
to viewpoint discrimination when in the course of applying this
policy it denies space to a person who wishes to speak in favor
of a particular political candidate. Accord, Lehman v. Shaker
Heights, 418 U.S. 298, 304, 94 S.Ct. 2714, 2717-2718, 41 L.Ed.2d
770 (1974) (plurality opinion).
<P>
Accordingly, the prohibition on viewpoint discrimination serves
that important purpose of the Free Speech Clause, which is to
bar the government from skewing public debate. Other things being
equal, viewpoint discrimination occurs when government allows
one message while prohibiting the messages of *2549 those who
can reasonably be expected to respond. See First Nat. Bank of
Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 785-786, 98 S.Ct. 1407, 1420-1421,
55 L.Ed.2d 707 (1978) (&quot;Especially where ... the legislature's
suppression of speech suggests an attempt to give one side of
a debatable public question an advantage in expressing its views
to the people, the First Amendment is plainly offended&quot;)
(footnote omitted); Madison Joint School Dist. No. 8 v. Wisconsin
Employment Relations Comm'n, 429 U.S. 167, 175-176, 97 S.Ct. 421,
426, 50 L.Ed.2d 376 (1976) (&quot;to permit one side of a debatable
public question to have a monopoly in expressing its views ...
is the antithesis of constitutional guarantees&quot;) (footnote
omitted); United States v. Kokinda, 497 U.S. 720, 736, 110 S.Ct.
3115, 3124, 111 L.Ed.2d 571 (1990) (viewpoint discrimination involves
an &quot;inten[t] to discourage one viewpoint and advance another&quot;)
(plurality opinion) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).
It is precisely this element of taking sides in a public debate
that identifies viewpoint discrimination and makes it the most
pernicious of all distinctions based on content. Thus, if government
assists those espousing one point of view, neutrality requires
it to assist those espousing opposing points of view, as well.
<P>
There is no viewpoint discrimination in the University's application
of its Guidelines to deny funding to Wide Awake. Under those Guidelines,
a &quot;religious activit[y],&quot; which is not eligible for
funding, App. to Pet. for Cert. 62a, is &quot;an activity which
primarily promotes or manifests a particular belief(s) in or about
a deity or an ultimate reality,&quot; App. to Pet. for Cert. 66a.
It is clear that this is the basis on which Wide Awake Productions
was denied funding.
<P>
Letter from Student Council to Ronald W. Rosenberger. App. 54
(&quot;In reviewing the request by Wide Awake Productions, the
Appropriations Committee determined your organization's request
could not be funded as it is a religious activity&quot;). The
discussion of Wide Awake's content, supra, at 2534-2536, shows
beyond any question that it &quot;primarily promotes or manifests
a particular belief(s) in or about a deity ...,&quot; in the very
specific sense that its manifest function is to call students
to repentance, to commitment to Jesus Christ, and to particular
moral action because of its Christian character. 
<P>
If the Guidelines were written or applied so as to limit only
such Christian advocacy and no other evangelical efforts that
might compete with it, the discrimination would be based on viewpoint.
But that is not what the regulation authorizes; it applies to
Muslim and Jewish and Buddhist advocacy as well as to Christian.
And since it limits funding to activities promoting or manifesting
a particular belief not only &quot;in&quot; but &quot;about&quot;
a deity or ultimate reality, it applies to agnostics and atheists
as well as it does to deists and theists (as the University maintained
at oral argument, Tr. of Oral Arg. 18-19, and as the Court recognizes,
see ante, at 2520). The Guidelines, and their application to Wide
Awake, thus do not skew debate by funding one position but not
its competitors. As understood by their application to Wide Awake,
they simply deny funding for hortatory speech that &quot;primarily
promotes or manifests&quot; any view on the merits of religion;
they deny funding for the entire subject matter of religious apologetics.
<P>
The Court, of course, reads the Guidelines differently, but while
I believe the Court is wrong in construing their breadth, the
important point is that even on the Court's own construction the
Guidelines impose no viewpoint discrimination. In attempting to
demonstrate the potentially chilling effect such funding restrictions
might have on learning in our nation's universities, the Court
describes the Guidelines as &quot;a sweeping restriction on student
thought and student inquiry,&quot; disentitling a vast array of
topics to funding. Ante, at 2520. As the Court reads the Guidelines
to exclude &quot;any writing that is explicable as resting upon
a premise which presupposes the existence of a deity or ultimate
reality,&quot; as well as &quot;those student journalistic efforts
which primarily manifest or promote a belief that there is no
deity and no ultimate reality,&quot; the Court concludes that
the major works of writers from Descartes to Sartre would be barred
from the funding forum. Ante, at 2520. The Court goes so far as
to suggest that the Guidelines, properly interpreted, tolerate
nothing much more *2550 than essays on &quot;making pasta or peanut
butter cookies....&quot; Ante, at 2520.
<P>
Now, the regulation is not so categorically broad as the Court
protests. The Court reads the word &quot;primarily&quot; (&quot;primarily
promotes or manifests a particular belief(s) in or about a deity
or an ultimate reality&quot;) right out of the Guidelines, whereas
it is obviously crucial in distinguishing between works characterized
by the evangelism of Wide Awake and writing that merely happens
to express views that a given religion might approve, or simply
descriptive writing informing a reader about the position of a
given religion. But, as I said, that is not the important point.
Even if the Court were indeed correct about the funding restriction's
categorical breadth, the stringency of the restriction would most
certainly not work any impermissible viewpoint discrimination
under any prior understanding of that species of content discrimination.
If a University wished to fund no speech beyond the subjects of
pasta and cookie preparation, it surely would not be discriminating
on the basis of someone's viewpoint, at least absent some controversial
claim that pasta and cookies did not exist. The upshot would be
an instructional universe without higher education, but not a
universe where one viewpoint was enriched above its competitors.
<P>
The Guidelines are thus substantially different from the access
restriction considered in Lamb's Chapel, the case upon which the
Court heavily relies in finding a viewpoint distinction here,
ante, at 2517-2518. Lamb's Chapel addressed a school board's regulation
prohibiting the after-hours use of school premises &quot;by any
group for religious purposes,&quot; even though the forum otherwise
was open for a variety of social, civic, and recreational purposes.
508 U.S., at ----, 113 S.Ct., at 2144 (citation and internal quotation
marks omitted).
<P>
&quot;Religious&quot; was understood to refer to the viewpoint
of a believer, and the regulation did not purport to deny access
to any speaker wishing to express a non-religious or expressly
antireligious point of view on any subject, see ibid. (&quot;The
issue in this case is whether ... it violates the Free Speech
Clause of the First Amendment ... to deny a church access to school
premises to exhibit for public viewing and for assertedly religious
purposes, a film dealing with family and child-rearing issues&quot;);
id., at ---- - ----, 113 S.Ct., at 2144, citing May v. Evansville-Vanderburgh
School Corp., 787 F.2d 1105, 1114 (CA7 1986). (FN13)
<P>
With this understanding, it was unremarkable that in Lamb's Chapel
we unanimously determined that the access restriction, as applied
to a speaker wishing to discuss family values from a Christian
perspective, impermissibly distinguished between speakers on the
basis of viewpoint. See Lamb's Chapel, supra, at ---- - ----,
113 S.Ct., at ---- - ---- (considering as-applied challenge only).
Equally obvious is the distinction between that case and this
one, where the regulation is being applied, not to deny funding
for those who discuss issues in general from a religious viewpoint,
but to those engaged in promoting or opposing religious conversion
and religious observances as such. If this amounts to viewpoint
discrimination, the Court has all but eviscerated the line between
viewpoint and content.
<P>
*2551. To put the point another way, the Court's decision equating
a categorical exclusion of both sides of the religious debate
with viewpoint discrimination suggests the Court has concluded
that primarily religious and antireligious speech, grouped together,
always provides an opposing (and not merely a related) viewpoint
to any speech about any secular topic. Thus, the Court's reasoning
requires a university that funds private publications about any
primarily nonreligious topic also to fund publications primarily
espousing adherence to or rejection of religion. But a university's
decision to fund a magazine about racism, and not to fund publications
aimed at urging repentance before God does not skew the debate
either about racism or the desirability of religious conversion.
The Court's contrary holding amounts to a significant reformulation
of our viewpoint discrimination precedents and will significantly
expand access to limited-access forums. See Greer v. Spock, 424
U.S. 828, 96 S.Ct. 1211, 47 L.Ed.2d 505 (1976) (upholding regulation
prohibiting political speeches on military base); Cornelius, 473
U.S., at 812, 105 S.Ct., at 3454 (exclusion from fundraising drive
of political activity or advocacy groups is facially viewpoint
neutral despite inclusion of charitable, health and welfare agencies);
Perry, 460 U.S., at 49-50, and n. 9, 103 S.Ct., at 957-958, and
n. 9 (ability of teachers' bargaining representative to use internal
school mail system does not require that access be provided to
&quot;any other citizen's group or community organization with
a message for school personnel&quot;); Lehman, 418 U.S., at 304,
94 S.Ct., at 2718 (exclusion of political messages from forum
permissible despite ability of nonpolitical speakers to use the
forum) (plurality opinion).
<P>
III
<P>
Since I cannot see the future I cannot tell whether today's decision
portends much more than making a shambles out of student activity
fees in public colleges. Still, my apprehension is whetted by
Chief Justice Burger's warning in Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S.
602, 624, 91 S.Ct. 2105, 2116, 29 L.Ed.2d 745 (1971): &quot;in
constitutional adjudication some steps, which when taken were
thought to approach 'the verge,' have become the platform for
yet further steps. A certain momentum develops in constitutional
theory and it can be a 'downhill thrust' easily set in motion
but difficult to retard or stop.&quot;
<P>
I respectfully dissent. FN* The syllabus constitutes no part of
the opinion of the Court but has been prepared by the Reporter
of Decisions for the convenience of the reader. See United States
v. Detroit Lumber Co., 200 U.S. 321, 337, 26 S.Ct. 282, 287, 50
L.Ed. 499.
<P>
FN1. The dissent suggests that the assessment bill would have
created a &quot;generally available subsidy program&quot; comparable
to respondent's Student Activities Fund (SAF). See post, at 2536,
n. 1. The dissent's characterization of the bill, however, is
squarely at odds with the bill's clear purpose and effect to provide
&quot;for the support of Christian teachers.&quot;
<P>
Everson, 330 U.S., at 72, 67 S.Ct., at 539. Moreover, the section
of the bill cited by the dissent, see post, at 2536-2537, n. 1,
simply indicated that funds would be &quot;disposed of under the
direction of the General Assembly, for the encouragement of seminaries
of learning within the Counties whence such sums shall arise,&quot;
Everson, supra, at 74, 67 S.Ct., at 540. This provision disposing
of undesignated funds hardly transformed the &quot;Bill Establishing
a Provision for Teachers of the Christian Religion&quot; into
a truly neutral program that would benefit religious adherents
as part of a large class of beneficiaries defined without reference
to religion. Indeed, the only appropriation of money made by the
bill would have been to promote &quot;the general diffusion of
Christian knowledge,&quot; id., at 72, 67 S.Ct., at 539; any possible
appropriation for &quot;seminaries of learning&quot; depended
entirely on future legislative action.
<P>
Even assuming that future legislators would adhere to the bill's
directive in appropriating the undesignated tax revenues, nothing
in the bill would prevent use of those funds solely for sectarian
educational institutions. To the contrary, most schools at the
time of the founding were affiliated with some religious organization,
see C. Antieau, A. Downey, &amp; E. Roberts, Freedom From Federal
Establishment, Formation and Early History of the First Amendment
Religion Clauses 163 (1964), and in fact there was no system of
public education in Virginia until several decades after the assessment
bill was proposed, see A. Morrison, The Beginnings of Public Education
in Virginia, 1776-1860, p. 9 (1917); see also A. Johnson, The
Legal Status of Church-State Relationships in the United States
4 (1982) (&quot;In Virginia the parish institutions transported
from England were the earliest educational agencies. Although
much of the teaching took place in the home and with the aid of
tutors, every minister had a school, and it was the duty of the
vestry to see that all the poor children were taught to read and
write&quot;) (footnote omitted). Further, the clearly religious
tenor of the Virginia assessment would seem to point toward appropriation
of residual funds to sectarian &quot;seminaries of learning.&quot;
Finally, although modern historians have focused on the opt-out
provision, the dissent provides no indication that Madison viewed
the Virginia assessment as an evenhanded program; in fact, several
of the objections expressed in Madison's Memorial and Remonstrance
Against Religious Assessments, reprinted in Everson, supra, at
63, 67 S.Ct., at 534-535, focus clearly on the bill's violation
of the principle of &quot;equality,&quot; or evenhandedness. See
infra, at 2529-2530.
<P>
FN2. To the contrary, Madison's Remonstrance decried the fact
that the assessment bill would require civil society to take &quot;cognizance&quot;
of religion. Madison's Remonstrance p 1, reprinted in Everson
v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.S. 1, 64, 67 S.Ct. 504, 535, 91
L.Ed. 711 (1947). Respondent's exclusion of religious activities
from SAF funding creates this very problem.
<P>
It requires University officials to classify publications as &quot;religious
activities,&quot; and to discriminate against the publications
that fall into that category. Such a policy also contravenes the
principles expressed in Madison'sRemonstrance by encouraging religious
adherents to cleanse their speech of religious overtones, thus
&quot;degrad[ing] from the equal rank of Citizens all those whose
opinions in Religion do not bend to those of the Legislative authority.&quot;
Id. p 9, reprinted in Everson, supra, at 69, 67 S.Ct., at 537.
*2551_ 
<P>
FN3. A number of other, less familiar examples of what amount
to direct funding appear in early Acts of Congress. See, e.g.
Act of Feb. 20, 1833, ch. 42, 4 Stat. 618-619 (authorizing the
State of Ohio to sell &quot;all or any part of the lands heretofore
reserved and appropriated by Congress for the support of religion
within the Ohio Company's ... purchases ... and to invest the
money arising from the sale thereof, in some productive fund;
the proceeds of which shall be for ever annually applied ... for
the support of religion within the several townships for which
said lands were originally reserved and set apart, and for no
other use or purpose whatsoever&quot;); Act of Mar. 2, 1833, ch.
86, Secs. 1, 3, 6 Stat. 538 (granting to Georgetown College--a
Jesuit institution--&quot;lots in the city of Washington, to the
amount, in value, of twenty-five thousand dollars,&quot; and directing
the College to sell the lots and invest the proceeds, thereafter
using the dividends to establish and endow such professorships
as it saw fit); see also Wallace v. Jaffree, 472 U.S. 38, 103,
105 S.Ct. 2479, 2514, 86 L.Ed.2d 29 (1985) (REHNQUIST, J., dissenting)
(&quot;As the United States moved from the 18th into the 19th
century, Congress appropriated time and again public moneys in
support of sectarian Indian education carried on by religious
organizations&quot;).
<P>
FN4. The Virginia experience during the period of the Assessment
Controversy
<P>
itself is inconsistent with the rigid &quot;no-aid&quot; principle
embraced by the dissent. Since at least 1777, the Virginia legislature
authorized tax exemptions for property belonging to the &quot;commonwealth,
or to any county, town, college, houses for divine worship, or
seminary of learning.&quot; Act of Jan. 23, 1800, ch. 2, Sec.
1, 1800 Va.Acts. And even Thomas Jefferson, respondent's founder
and a champion of disestablishment in Virginia, advocated the
use of public funds in Virginia for a department of theology in
conjunction with other professional schools. See S. Padover, The
Complete Jefferson 1067 (1943); see also id., at 958 (noting that
Jefferson advocated giving &quot;to the sectarian schools of divinity
the full benefit [of] the public provisions made for instruction
in the other branches of science&quot;).
<P>
FN5. In the tax literature, this identity is called a &quot;tax
expenditure,&quot; a concept &quot;based upon recognition of the
fact that a government can appropriate money to a particular person
or group by using a special, narrowly directed tax deduction or
exclusion, instead of by using its ordinary direct spending mechanisms.
For example, a government with a general income tax, wanting to
add $7,000 to the spendable income of a preacher whose top tax
rate is 30%, has two ways of subsidizing him. The government can
send the preacher a check for $10,000 and tax him on all of his
income, or it can authorize him to reduce his taxable income by
$23,333.33 [resulting in a tax saving of $7,000]. If the direct
payment were itself taxable and did not alter his tax bracket,
the preacher would receive the same benefit from the tax deduction
as he would from the direct payment.&quot; Wolfman, Tax Expenditures:
From Idea to Ideology, 99 Harv.L.Rev. 491, 491-492 (1985). In
fact, Congress has provided a similar &quot;tax expenditure&quot;
in Sec. 107 of the Internal Revenue Code by granting a &quot;
'minister of the gospel' &quot; an unlimited exclusion for the
rental value of any home furnished as part of his pay or for the
rental allowance paid to him. See id., at 492, n. 6.
<P>
Although Professor Bittker is certainly a leading scholar in the
tax field, the dissent's reliance on Bittker, see post, at 20,
n. 7, is misplaced in this context. See Adler, The Internal Revenue
Code, The Constitution, and the Courts: The Use of Tax Expenditure
Analysis in Judicial Decision Making, 28 Wake Forest L.Rev. 855,
862, n. 30 (1993):
<P>
&quot;Early criticism of the tax expenditure concept focused on
the difficulty of drawing a dividing line between what is or is
not a special provision. Professor Boris Bittker, for example,
argued that since no tax is all inclusive, exemptions from any
tax could not be described as the equivalent of subsidies. Boris
I. Bittker, Churches, Taxes and the Constitution, 78 Yale L.J.
1285 (1969). This wholesale rejection of tax expenditure analysis
was short-lived and attracted few supporters. Rather, the large
body of literature about tax expenditures accepts the basic concept
that special exemptions from tax function as subsidies. The current
debate focuses on whether particular items are correctly identified
as tax expenditures and whether incentive provisions are more
efficient when structured as tax expenditures rather than direct
spending programs. See generally [numerous authorities].&quot;
*2551_ FN1. Justice THOMAS suggests that Madison would have approved
of the assessment bill if only it had satisfied the principle
of evenhandedness. Nowhere in the Remonstrance, however, did Madison
advance the view that Virginia should be able to provide financial
support for religion as part of a generally available subsidy
program. Indeed, while Justice THOMAS claims that the &quot;funding
provided by the Virginia assessment was to be extended only to
Christian sects,&quot; ante, at 2529, it is clear that the bill
was more general in scope than this. While the bill, which is
reprinted in Everson v. Board of Ed. of Ewing, 330 U.S. 1, 72-74,
67 S.Ct. 504, 538-540, 91 L.Ed. 711 (1947), provided that each
taxpayer could designate a religious society to which he wanted
his levy paid, id., at 73, 67 S.Ct., at 539, it would also have
allowed a taxpayer to refuse to appropriate his levy to any religious
society, in which case the legislature was to use these unappropriated
sums to fund &quot;seminaries of learning.&quot; Id., at 74, 67
S.Ct., at 540 (contrary to Justice THOMAS's unsupported assertion,
this portion of the bill was no less obligatory than any other).
While some of these seminaries undoubtedly would have been religious
in character, others would not have been, as a seminary was generally
understood at the time to be &quot;any school, academy, college
or university, in which young persons are instructed in the several
branches of learning which may qualify them for their future employments.&quot;
N. Webster, An American Dictionary of the English Language (1st
ed. 1828); see also 14 The Oxford English Dictionary 956 (2d ed.1989).
Not surprisingly, then, scholars have generally agreed that the
bill would have provided funding for nonreligious schools. See,
e.g., Laycock, &quot;Nonpreferential&quot; Aid to Religion: A
False Claim About Original Intent, 27 Wm. &amp; Mary L.Rev. 875,
897 (1986) (&quot;Any taxpayer could refuse to designate a church,
with undesignated church taxes going to a fund for schools ...
The bill used the phrase 'seminaries of learning,' which almost
certainly meant schools generally and not just schools for the
training of ministers&quot;); T. Buckley, Church and State in
Revolutionary Virginia, 1776-1787, p. 133 (1977) (&quot;The assessment
had been carefully drafted to permit those who preferred to support
education rather than religion to do so&quot;); T. Curry, The
First Freedoms 141 (1986) (&quot;[T]hose taxes not designated
for any specific denomination [were] allocated to education&quot;).
It is beside the point that &quot;there was no system of public
education in Virginia until several decades after the assessment
bill was proposed,&quot; ante, at 2529, n. 1 (THOMAS, J., concurring);
because the bill was never passed, the funds that it would have
made available for secular, public schools never materialized.
The fact that the bill, if passed, would have funded secular as
well as religious instruction did nothing to soften Madison's
opposition to it.
<P>
Nor is it fair to argue that Madison opposed the bill only because
it treated religious groups unequally. Ante, at 2529 (THOMAS,
J., concurring). In various paragraphs of the Remonstrance, Madison
did complain about the bill's peculiar burdens and exemptions,
Everson, supra, at 66, 67 S.Ct., at 536, but to identify this
factor as the sole point of Madison's opposition to the bill is
unfaithful to the Remonstrance's text. Madison strongly inveighed
against the proposed aid for religion for a host of reasons (the
Remonstrance numbers 15 paragraphs, each containing at least one
point in opposition), and crucial here is the fact that many of
those reasons would have applied whether or not the state aid
was being distributed equally among sects, and whether or not
the aid was going to those sects in the context of an evenhanded
government program. See, e.g., Madison's Remonstrance, reprinted
in Everson, 330 U.S., at 64, 67 S.Ct., at 535, p 1 (&quot;[I]n
matters of Religion, no man's right is abridged by the institution
of Civil Society, and ... Religion is wholly exempt from its cognizance&quot;);
id., at 67, 67 S.Ct., at 536-537, p 6 (arguing that State support
of religion &quot;is a contradiction to the Christian Religion
itself; for every page of it disavows a dependence on the powers
of this world&quot;); ibid., p 7 (&quot;[E]xperience witnesseth
that ecclesiastical establishments, instead of maintaining the
purity and efficacy of Religion, have had a contrary operation&quot;).
Madison's objections were supplemented by numerous other petitions
in opposition to the bill that likewise do not suggest that the
lack of evenhandedness was its dispositive flaw. L. Levy, The
Establishment Clause 63-67 (2d ed.1994). For example, the petition
that received the largest number of signatories was motivated
by the view that religion should only be supported voluntarily.
Id., at 63-64. Indeed, Madison's Remonstrance did not argue for
a bill distributing aid to all sects and religions on an equal
basis, and the outgrowth of the Remonstrance and the defeat of
the Virginia assessment was not such a bill; rather, it was the
Virginia Bill for Establishing Religious Freedom, which, as discussed
in the text, proscribed the use of tax dollars for religious purposes.
<P>
In attempting to recast Madison's opposition as having principally
been targeted against &quot;governmental preferences for particular
religious faiths,&quot; ante, at 2530 (emphasis in original),
Justice THOMAS wishes to wage a battle that was lost long ago,
for &quot;this Court has rejected unequivocally the contention
that the Establishment Clause forbids only governmental preference
of one religion over another,&quot; School Dist. of Abington v.

<P>
*2551_ FN2. Justice THOMAS attempts to cast doubt on this accepted
version of Establishment Clause history by reference to historical
facts that are largely inapposite. Ante, at 2530-2531, 2533 (concurring
opinion). As I have said elsewhere, individual Acts of Congress,
especially when they are few and far between, scarcely serve as
an authoritative guide to the meaning of the religion clauses,
for &quot;like other politicians, [members of the early Congresses]
could raise constitutional ideals one day and turn their backs
on them the next. [For example,] ... [t]en years after proposing
the First Amendment, Congress passed the Alien and Sedition Acts,
measures patently unconstitutional by modern standards. If the
early Congress's political actions were determinative, and not
merely relevant, evidence of constitutional meaning, we would
have to gut our current First Amendment doctrine to make room
for political censorship.&quot; Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. 577,
626, 112 S.Ct. 2649, 2676, 120 L.Ed.2d 467 (1992) (concurring
opinion). The legislation cited by Justice THOMAS, including the
Northwest Ordinance, is no more dispositive than the Alien and
Sedition Acts in interpreting the First Amendment. Even less persuasive,
then, are citations to constitutionally untested Acts dating from
the mid-19th century, for without some rather innovative argument,
they cannot be offered as providing an authoritative gloss on
the Framers' intent.
<P>
Justice THOMAS's references to Madison's actions as a legislator
also provide little support for his cause. Justice THOMAS seeks
to draw a significant lesson out of the fact that, in seeking
to disestablish the Anglican Church in Virginia in 1776, Madison
did not inveigh against state funding of religious activities.
Ante, at 2530 (concurring opinion). That was not the task at hand,
however. Madison was acting with the specific goal of eliminating
the special privileges enjoyed by Virginia Anglicans, and he made
no effort to lay out the broader views of church and state that
came to bear in his drafting of the First Amendment some 13 years
later. That Madison did not speak in more expansive terms than
necessary in 1776 was hardly surprising for, as it was, his proposal
was defeated by the Virginia Convention as having gone too far.
Ibid.
<P>
Similarly, the invocation of Madison's tenure on the congressional
committee that approved funding for legislative chaplains provides
no support for more general principles that run counter to settled
Establishment Clause jurisprudence. As I have previously pointed
out, Madison, upon retirement, &quot;insisted that 'it was not
with my approbation, that the deviation from [the immunity of
religion from civil jurisdiction] took place in Congs., when they
appointed Chaplains, to be paid from the Natl. Treasury.' &quot;
Lee, supra, at 625, n. 6, 112 S.Ct., at 2675, n. 6, quoting Letter
from J. Madison to E. Livingston (July 10, 1822), in 5 The Founders'
Constitution, at 105. And when we turned our attention to deciding
whether funding of legislative chaplains posed an establishment
problem, we did not address the practice as one instance of a
larger class of permissible government funding of religious activities.
Instead, Marsh v. Chambers, 463 U.S. 783, 791, 103 S.Ct. 3330,
3335-3336, 77 L.Ed.2d 1019 (1983), explicitly relied on the singular,
200-year pedigree of legislative chaplains, noting that &quot;[t]his
unique history&quot; justified carving out an exception for the
specific practice in question. Given that the decision upholding
this practice was expressly limited to its facts, then, it would
stand the Establishment Clause on its head to extract from it
a broad rule permitting the funding of religious activities.
<P>
FN3. In the District Court, the parties agreed to the following
facts: &quot;The University of Virginia has charged at all times
relevant herein and currently charges each full-time student a
compulsory student activity fee of $14.00 per semester. There
is no procedural or other mechanism by which a student may decline
to pay the fee.&quot; App. 37; see also App. 9, 21.
<P>
FN4. To the extent the Court perceives some distinction between
the printing and dissemination of evangelism and proselytization,
and core religious activity &quot;in [its] usual sense,&quot;
ante, at 2524, this distinction goes entirely unexplained in the
Court's opinion.
<P>
FN5. In a narrow band of cases at the polar extreme from direct
funding cases, those involving essential public benefits commonly
associated with living in an organized society (like police and
fire protection, for example), evenhandedness may become important
to ensuring that religious interests are not inhibited.
<P>
*2551_ FN6. In Zobrest, a deaf student sought to have an interpreter,
provided under a state Act aiding individuals with disabilities,
accompany him to a Roman Catholic high school. In Witters, a blind
student sought to use aid, provided under a state program for
assistance to handicapped persons, to attend a private Christian
college. In Mueller, parents sought to take a tax deduction, available
for parents of both public and nonpublic schoolchildren, for certain
expenses incurred in connection with providing education for their
children in private religious schools.
<P>
FN7. Walz v. Tax Comm'n of New York City, 397 U.S. 664, 90 S.Ct.
1409, 25 L.Ed.2d 697 (1970), is yet another example of a case
in which the Court treated the general availability of a government
benefit as a significant condition defining compliance with the
Establishment Clause, but did not deem that condition sufficient.
In upholding state property tax exemptions given to religious
organizations in Walz, we noted that the law at issue was applicable
to &quot;a broad class of property owned by nonprofit [and] quasipublic
corporations,&quot; id., at 673, 90 S.Ct., at 1413, but did not
rest on that factor alone. Critical to our decision was the central
principle that direct funding of religious activities is prohibited
under the Establishment Clause. &quot;It is sufficient to note
that for the men who wrote the Religion Clauses of the First Amendment
the 'establishment' of a religion connoted sponsorship, financial
support, and active involvement of the sovereign in religious
activity.&quot; Id., at 668, 90 S.Ct., at 1411. We emphasized
that the tax exemptions did not involve the expenditure of government
funds in support of religious activities. &quot;The grant of a
tax exemption is not sponsorship since the government does not
transfer part of its revenue to churches but simply abstains from
demanding that the church support the state.&quot; Id., at 675,
90 S.Ct., at 1415. Moreover, we noted that in the property taxation
context, &quot;exemption[s] creat[e] only a minimal and remote
involvement between church and state and far less than taxation
of churches,&quot; and in operation &quot;ten[d] to complement
and reinforce the desired separation insulating&quot; church and
state, id., at 676, 90 S.Ct., at 1415; and that religious property
tax exemptions have been in place for over 200 years without disruption
to the interests represented by the Establishment Clause, id.,
at 676-680, 90 S.Ct., at 1415-1417.
<P>
Justice THOMAS's assertion, that &quot;[a] tax exemption in many
cases is economically and functionally indistinguishable from
a direct monetary subsidy,&quot; ante, at 2531 (concurring opinion)
(footnote omitted), assumes that the &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;correct&quot;
tax base is so self-evident that any provision excusing a person
or institution from taxes to which others are subjected must be
a departure from the natural tax base rather than part of the
definition of the tax base itself. The equivalence (asserted by
Justice THOMAS, ante, at 2531) between a direct money subsidy
and the tax liability avoided by an institution (because it is
part of the class of institutions that defines the relevant tax
base by its exclusion) was tested and dispatched long ago by Professor
Bittker in Churches, Taxes and the Constitution, 78 Yale L.J.
1285 (1969). Justice THOMAS's suggestion that my &quot;reliance
on Bittker ... is misplaced in this context,&quot; ante, at 2532,
n. 5, is not on point. Even granting that Justice THOMAS's assertion
of equivalence is reasonable, he cannot and does not deny the
fact that the Court in Walz explicitly distinguished tax exemptions
from direct money subsidies, 397 U.S., at 675, 90 S.Ct., at 1414,
and rested its decision on that distinction. If Justice THOMAS's
assertion of equivalence should prevail then the Walz Court necessarily
was wrong about a distinction critical to its holding. Justice
THOMAS can hardly use Walz coherently for support after removing
the basis on which it relies.
<P>

entire Court was unanimous on this point. See, 403 U.S., at 682-684,

*2551_ FN9. Congress apparently also reads our cases as the University
did, for it routinely excludes religious activities from general
funding programs. See, e.g., 20 U.S.C. Sec. 1062(b) (federal grant
program for institutions of higher education; &quot;[n]o grant

<P>
FN10. The Court acknowledges that &quot;if the State pays a church's
bills it is subsidizing it,&quot; and concedes that &quot;we must
guard against this abuse.&quot; Ante, at 2524. These concerns
are not present here, the Court contends, because Wide Awake &quot;is
not a religious institution, at least in the usual sense of that
term as used in our case law.&quot; Ibid. The Court's concession
suggests that its distinction between paying a religious institution
and paying a religious institution's bills is not really significant.
But if the Court is relying on its characterization of Wide Awake
as not a religious institution, &quot;at least in the usual sense,&quot;
the Court could presumably stop right there.
<P>
FN11. The Court draws a distinction between a State's use of public
funds to advance its own speech and the State's funding of private
speech, suggesting that authority to make content-related choices
is at its most powerful when the State undertakes the former.
Ante, at 2518-2519. I would not argue otherwise, see Hazelwood
School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S. 260, 270-273, 108 S.Ct. 562,
569-571, 98 L.Ed.2d 592 (1988), but I do suggest that this case
reveals the difficulties that can be encountered in drawing this
distinction. There is a communicative element inherent in the
very act of funding itself, cf. Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1,
15-19, 96 S.Ct. 612, 632-635, 46 L.Ed.2d 659 (1976) (per curiam
), and although it is the student speakers who choose which particular
messages to advance in the forum created by the University, the
initial act of defining the boundaries of the forum is a decision
attributable to the University, not the students. In any event,
even assuming that private and state speech always may be separated
by clean lines and that this case involves only the former, I
believe the distinction is irrelevant here because, as is discussed
infra, this case does not involve viewpoint discrimination. *2551_
FN12. I do not decide that all viewpoint discrimination in a public
university's funding determinations would violate the Free Speech
Clause. If, however, the determinations are made on the basis
of a reasonable subject-matter distinction, but not on a viewpoint
distinction, there is no violation. In a limited-access forum,
a speech restriction must be &quot;reasonable in light of the
purpose served by the forum&quot; as well as viewpoint-neutral.
E.g., Lamb's Chapel, 508 U.S., at ----, 113 S.Ct., at 2147, quoting
Cornelius, 473 U.S., at 806, 105 S.Ct., at 3439. Because petitioners
have not challenged the University's Guideline as unreasonable,
I express no opinion on that or on the question whether the reasonableness
criterion applies in speech funding cases in the same manner that
it applies in limited-access forum cases.
<P>
FN13. See also Tr. of Oral Arg. in Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches
Union Free School Dist., --- U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct. 51, 121 L.Ed.2d
20, where counsel for the school district charged with enforcing
the restriction unequivocally admitted that anyone with an atheistic
or antireligious message would be permitted to use school property
under the rules of the forum. Id., at 47, 57-58. The complete
exchange during the oral argument in Lamb's Chapel went as follows:
<P>
&quot;QUESTION: But do I understand your statement you made earlier
that supposing you had a communist group that wanted to address
the subject of family values and they thought there was a value
in not having children waste their time going to Sunday school
or church and therefore they had a point of view that was definitely
antireligious, they would be permitted, under your policy, to
discuss family values in that context?
<P>
&quot;[COUNSEL]: Yes. Yes, Your Honor, that's correct.
<P>
&quot;QUESTION: Counsel, in your earlier discussions with [the
Court] you indicated that communists would be able to give their
perspective on family. I--I assume from that that atheists would
be able to give theirs under your rules.
<P>
&quot;[COUNSEL]: Yes, Your Honor.&quot;

of the Attorney General, Richmond, Virginia, for appellees.
<P>
Before ERVIN, Chief Judge, WILLIAMS, Circuit Judge, and SPROUSE,
Senior Circuit Judge.
<P>
OPINION
<P>
ERVIN, Chief Judge:
<P>
We must decide whether a state university's refusal to disburse
monies from its student activities fund for the benefit of a student-run
religious publication violates the First and Fourteenth Amendments
to the Constitution. We hold that it does not.
<P>
I
<P>
A
<P>
The University of Virginia collects a mandatory student activities
fee of fourteen dollars per semester, together with tuition payments,
from each of its full-time students. The proceeds of the collection
are deposited in the University's Student Activities Fund (&quot;SAF&quot;),
which is used to support the wide variety of student organizations,
activities, and publications that function at the University.
<P>
To qualify for student-activity-fee funds, a student group first
must attain the status of a &quot;Contracted Independent Organization&quot;
(&quot;CIO&quot;) at the University. CIO status is available to
any group that is composed in its majority of students, is managed
by officers who are full-time students, keeps an updated copy
of its constitution on file with the University, and signs an
anti-discrimination disclaimer. CIOs are given access to University
facilities, including meeting rooms and computer terminals, as
well as the right to apply for student-activity-fee funds. The
standard CIO agreement executed between qualified student groups
and the University states that benefits provided to the groups
by the University
<P>
should not be misinterpreted as meaning that those organizations
are part of or controlled by the University, that the University
is responsible for the organizations' *271 contracts or other
acts or omissions, or that the University approves of the organizations'
goals or activities.
<P>
As the corporate body responsible under state law for governing
the institution, (FN1) the Rector and Visitors of the University
of Virginia (&quot;Rector and Visitors&quot;) wield ultimate decisionmaking
power over the operation of the SAF. The Rector and Visitors have
delegated responsibility for allocating SAF monies to the University's
Student Council. A CIO seeking an SAF grant must submit a detailed
application for funding to the Appropriations Committee, a subcommittee
of the full Student Council, which approves or denies the request.
Appeal from a denial of funding by the Appropriations Committee
may be taken to the full Student Council. Upon the Council's affirmance
of the Appropriations Committee's decision, a second appeal may
be argued before the University's Student Activities Committee,
a faculty body chaired by a designee of the Vice President for
Student Affairs.
<P>
The decisions of each of these authorities with respect to awards
of SAF monies must be taken in compliance with certain guidelines
promulgated by the Rector and Visitors. These guidelines, adopted
in 1970, charge the Student Council with administering the SAF
&quot;in a manner consistent with the educational purpose of the
University as well as with State and Federal law.&quot; The guidelines
prohibit several categories of student organizations from obtaining
SAF funds, according to the nature of the organization and the
purpose for which the funds would be used. Although they may attain
CIO status, fraternities and sororities, political and religious
organizations, and groups whose membership policies are exclusionary
in nature are ineligible for SAF funding. The following expenditures
and activities also are excluded by the guidelines: (1) honoraria
or similar fees; (2) religious activities; (3) social entertainment
and related expenses; (4) philanthropic contributions and activities;
and (5) political activities. (FN2)
<P>
Once a student organization attains CIO status and becomes eligible
for funding, the guidelines prescribe the following criteria for
allocating SAF monies among CIOs: (1) the size of the group; (2)
the University-wide benefits conferred by the group's activities;
and (3) the group's financial self-sufficiency. After a student
organization is approved for funding, it submits expense vouchers
to the SAF, which are paid only upon a determination that a particular
expense is fundable under the guidelines. SAF monies are not paid
to the group, but are disbursed directly to the group's creditors
to discharge the fundable expense.
<P>
For the academic year 1990-91, 343 student organizations qualified
as CIOs. Of these 343 groups, 135 applied for SAF funding, and
118 were awarded SAF monies. Numbered among the funded organizations
were fifteen student publications; (FN3) also included were the
Muslim Students Association, the Jewish Law Students Association,
and the C.S. Lewis Society.
<P>
B
<P>
In September 1990 Ronald W. Rosenberger, an undergraduate at the
University, joined with other University students to found Wide
Awake Productions. According to its constitution, Wide Awake Productions
is an unincorporated association with the stated purposes of (1)
&quot;publishing a magazine *272 of philosophical and religious
expression&quot;; (2) &quot;facilitating discussion which fosters
an atmosphere of sensitivity to and tolerance of Christian viewpoints&quot;;
and (3) &quot;providing a unifying focus for Christians of multicultural
backgrounds.&quot; Wide Awake Productions publishes Wide Awake:
A Christian Perspective at the University of Virginia (&quot;Wide
Awake &quot;), a nonprofit journal written and edited by the student
members of Wide Awake Productions. As stated by Rosenberger, who
serves as editor-in-chief of Wide Awake, the journal (FN4) was
launched when the members of Wide Awake Productions &quot;realized
that none of the fifteen student-run publications at the University
provided a forum for Christian expression,&quot; and decided to
fill this perceived void. See &quot;Letter from the Editor,&quot;
Wide Awake: A Christian Perspective at the University of Virginia,
Nov.-Dec. 1990, at 2. Wide Awake and Wide Awake Productions are
not affiliated with any religious institution, and allow any University
student to join without regard to sex, race, religion, or color.
<P>
At the time notice of the instant appeal was filed, three issues
of Wide Awake had been published, with approximately 5,000 copies
of each issue being distributed free of charge to persons on the
University campus. According to editor Rosenberger's comments
in the first issue, Wide Awake 's mission is twofold: &quot;to
challenge Christians to live, in word and deed, according to the
faith they proclaim[,] and to encourage students to consider what
a personal relationship with Jesus Christ means.&quot; Id. In
furtherance of this mission, Wide Awake &quot;offers a Christian
perspective on both personal and community issues, especially
those relevant to college students at the University of Virginia.&quot;
Id.
<P>
The content of the three issues of Wide Awake published thus far
forms part of the record in this case. The first issue's cover
story, &quot;Eracing Mistakes,&quot; offered Christian solutions
for the enduring calamity of racism, see id. at 1, 12-14; other
articles treated such diverse issues as &quot;crisis pregnancy,&quot;
Oxford Christian apologeticist C.S. Lewis's ideas about evil and
free will, &quot;beating stress,&quot; and &quot;praying with
a thankful heart,&quot; all written from an avowedly Christian
stance. See id. at 4-5, 6-8, 15, 21. The featured contribution
in the second issue, &quot;Out of the Closet and Into the Light,&quot;
addressed the question &quot;How should the Church respond to
homosexuals ... and vice versa?&quot; See id., Mar./Apr.1991,
at 1, 14-17. The second issue also included an interview with
a Christian professor of mathematics at the University, an article
on Christian missionary work throughout the world, and two commentaries
offering spiritual guidance (titled respectively &quot;God's Word:
<P>
A Spiritual Advantage,&quot; and &quot;On Your Own: Hope and Spirit&quot;).
See id. at 5-7, 11-13, 20-21. The third issue contained articles
about a University graduate's experiences as a missionary in Moldavia,
eating disorders (titled &quot;From Calorie to Calvary&quot;),
and a Christian musician (&quot;Keith Green: Piano Man for Christ&quot;).
See id., Sept.-Oct. 1991, at 5-7, 12-14, 18-20. Columns in all
three issues reviewed newly released recordings of music of religious
disposition. (FN5) *273 The plaintiffs do not dispute that in
publishing Wide Awake they are engaged in a &quot;religious activit[y]&quot;
as the SAF guidelines define the phrase. (FN6) Indeed, after reading
its contents dispassionately, we are compelled to mark Wide Awake
's unflagging (FN7) invocation of religious, specifically Christian,
themes. The journal's pages are pervasively devoted to providing
a &quot;Christian perspective&quot; in printer's ink at the University
of Virginia. Wide Awake 's editorial stance extends to its advertising
sales: by the public release of the third issue represented in
the record (dated September/October 1991), roughly eighty percent
of the journal's five commercial and notice columns were given
over to Christian churches or to business entities purveying goods
and services of Christian bent. (FN8) Even Wide Awake 's physical
appearance draws attention to its religious posture:
<P>
the Christian symbol of the Cross, lying in a dark oval field,
is printed at the top of each page; another Cross marks the end
of each contribution.
<P>
Wide Awake Productions attained CIO status shortly after its founding.
Commensurate with this status, as the plaintiffs acknowledge,
the University openly accords Wide Awake Productions the same
access to University facilities as other CIOs. Such access includes
the use of University property for the group's meetings, functions,
and programs. CIO status affords the members of Wide Awake Productions
liberal recourse to University computer terminals, printers, and
other equipment employed in the preparation of manuscripts for
publication.
<P>
In January 1991, Ronald W. Rosenberger, on behalf of Wide Awake
Productions, submitted an application for SAF funding to the Appropriations
Committee of the Student Council in the amount of $5,862.00, to
cover publishing costs for Wide Awake. On February 26 of that
year the Appropriations Committee denied Rosenberger's application,
stating:
<P>
In reviewing the request by Wide Awake Productions, the ...
<P>
Committee determined your organization's request could not be
funded as it is a religious activity. This determination was made
after reviewing your first issue of Wide Awake. In particular,
the committee noted in your Editor's Letter that the publication
was &quot;a forum for Christian expression&quot; and a means &quot;to
challenge Christians (in how) to live&quot;....
<P>
Please be aware that this decision simply denies Student Activity
Fee funding for your publication. Wide Awake Productions may still
print and distribute issues on Grounds. (FN9)
<P>
The members of Wide Awake Productions promptly appealed the decision
to the full Student Council on March 3, 1991, contending that
their organization had satisfied all applicable SAF funding guidelines
and that the Appropriations Committee's denial of funding violated
the Constitution of the United States. The Student Council affirmed
the Appropriations Committee's decision without comment.
<P>
*274 Wide Awake Productions then appealed the Student Council's
ruling to the University's Student Activities Committee. On April
16, 1991, Associate Dean of Students Ronald J. Stump informed
Rosenberger of the Student Activities Committee's decision to
affirm the funding denial. Stump wrote:
<P>
After reviewing your organization's constitution, copies of the
magazine's first two editions, and the arguments presented at
last week's appeal by Wide Awake Productions and by [the] Student
Council, the Committee determined that the Wide Awake magazine
could not be funded as it is a religious activity. In effect,
the Student Activities Committee fully supports the decision and
reasoning provided to you in the February 26 letter from [the
Appropriations Committee]. As noted in [that] letter, Wide Awake
Productions may still print and distribute copies of the magazine
and as a CIO has full and equal access to other University facilities
and services.
<P>
The Student Activities Committee's repudiation exhausted all internal
avenues of appeal within the University for the institution's
denial of SAF funding to Wide Awake Productions.
<P>
C
<P>
On July 11, 1991, the members of Wide Awake Productions brought
this action against the Rector and Visitors and Dean Stump pursuant
to 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983.
<P>
(FN10) The plaintiffs' complaint set forth three challenges to
the SAF guidelines' exclusion of &quot;religious activities,&quot;
including the publication of Wide Awake, from eligibility for
funding consideration, each predicated upon provisions of the
Constitution of the United States. To each of the plaintiffs'
federal constitutional claims were appended alternative and supplemental
claims seeking recovery under the provisions of Article I of the
Constitution of Virginia (FN11) and, in the case of Count Two,
under the Virginia Act for Religious Freedom, Va.Code Ann. Secs.
57-1 to -2 (Michie 1985 &amp; Supp.1993). The plaintiffs did not
challenge directly the University's refusal to fund Wide Awake
Productions, except insofar as the adverse funding decisions flowed
directly from the requirements of the guidelines themselves.
<P>
(FN12)
<P>
Count One, the complaint's most comprehensive theory of recovery,
alleged that the guidelines' proscription of SAF funding for the
publication costs of Wide Awake violated the Free Speech and Press
Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution
(FN13) and Article I, Section 12 of the Virginia Constitution
(FN14) (1) by unlawfully depriving the members of Wide Awake Productions
of government benefits solely because of the content and viewpoint
of their speech in Wide Awake; and (2) by illegally excluding
the members of Wide Awake Productions from the &quot;limited public
forum&quot; created by the Rector and Visitors' establishment
of the SAF and promulgation of the funding guidelines. Count One
also contended that the guidelines' &quot;definitions for allocating
SAF funds to CIOs&quot; are unconstitutionally vague because persons
of ordinary intelligence must guess at their meaning, and unlawfully
*275 overbroad because they impinge constitutionally protected
activity.
<P>
Count Two of the complaint maintained that the guidelines' denial
of SAF funding to &quot;religious activities&quot; violated the
Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the Federal Constitution,
(FN15) Article I, Section 16 of the Virginia Constitution, (FN16)
and the Virginia Act for Religious Freedom, Va.Code Ann. Secs.
57-1 to -2 (Michie 1985 &amp; Supp.1993), (FN17) by discriminating
in the granting of a government benefit based upon (1) the religious
content of the expression in Wide Awake; and (2) the religious
beliefs, character, or affiliation of the members of Wide Awake
Productions. Count Two also imputed to the Rector and Visitors
&quot;conduct constitut[ing] a failure to give reasonable accommodation
to the plaintiffs' religious beliefs.&quot;
<P>
Count Three of the complaint alleged that the guidelines' prohibition
against subsidizing &quot;religious activit[ies],&quot; coupled
with the Rector and Visitors' denial of SAF funds to Wide Awake
Productions, violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment to the Federal Constitution (FN18) and the Anti-Discrimination
Clause of Article I, Section 11 of the Virginia Constitution.
(FN19) Specifically, Count Three contended (1) that the guidelines
&quot;den[ied] plaintiffs the benefits to which other students
and CIOs are entitled&quot; by unconstitutionally discriminating
against Wide Awake Productions on the basis of the content or
viewpoint of its members' speech and association; and (2) that
the guidelines unconstitutionally discriminated against the plaintiffs'
religious speech &quot;by denying [them] the benefits that other
students and CIOs engaged in religious speech and activities receive
and have received....&quot; This viewpoint- and religious-based
discrimination, Count Three maintained, was not justified by a
compelling state interest, nor was it narrowly tailored to achieve
whatever minimal interest the Rector and Visitors may have in
refusing to fund student &quot;religious activit[ies].&quot;
<P>
The plaintiffs sought redress for their alleged injuries in the
form of (1) a declaratory judgment that the guidelines' prohibition
against the funding of &quot;religious activities&quot; violated
their rights under the United States Constitution, the Virginia
Constitution, and the Virginia Act for Religious Freedom; (2)
a permanent order enjoining the Rector and Visitors from promulgating
any proscription against the funding of Wide Awake Productions
on the basis of the content or viewpoint of its members' speech
in Wide Awake;
<P>
(3) compensatory damages of at least $5,862.00, the sum of SAF
funds unconstitutionally denied Wide Awake Productions; and (4)
an order awarding Wide Awake Productions reasonable costs and
attorneys' fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1988. (FN20)
<P>
*276 Agreeing that there were no material facts at issue, both
parties sought summary judgment as a matter of law. After hearing
oral argument on their opposing motions, the district court granted
summary judgment in favor of the Rector and Visitors on each count
of the plaintiffs' complaint, concluding (1) that the SAF was
not a &quot;limited public forum;&quot; (2) that application of
the funding guidelines did not result in viewpoint or content
discrimination against the speech of Wide Awake Productions; and
(3) that the denial of funding did not burden the plaintiffs'
free exercise of religion. See Rosenberger v. Rector &amp; Visitors
of Univ. of Va., 795 F.Supp. 175, 178-83 (W.D.Va.1992) (mem.).
The court also held that the plaintiffs' equal
<P>
protection challenge to the guidelines failed because the members
of Wide Awake Productions had not adduced evidence of the Rector
and Visitors' discriminatory intent. Although the district court
did not scrutinize the complaint's allegations that the guidelines
violated the Virginia Constitution and the Virginia Act for Religious
Freedom, it held that the restrictions on funding for &quot;religious
activities&quot; did not &quot;impose an impermissible burden
on the plaintiffs' exercise of their rights as guaranteed by ...
the State Constitution[ ], or the Virginia Act for Religious Freedom.&quot;
Id. at 17.
<P>
This appeal followed.
<P>
II
<P>
Before addressing the substance of the plaintiffs' assignments
of error, we wish to make clear what precisely is at issue in
this appeal. The complaint alleges that the Rector and Visitors
have violated rights guaranteed the plaintiffs by the Constitution
of the United States, the Constitution of Virginia, and the Virginia
Act for Religious Freedom. Two of these sources derive from the
substantive law of the Commonwealth of Virginia. As such, they
comprise fonts of individual liberties independent of the Federal
Constitution, and are therefore susceptible of autonomous interpretation
by the courts of the Commonwealth. (FN21) Although the district
court embraced these pendent state-law claims in its favorable
grant of summary judgment to the Rector and Visitors, (FN22) they
were not controverted by the parties at the summary judgment hearing,
and were not subjected to independent scrutiny on their merits
below. We have no objective basis, therefore, upon which to assume
that any interpretation of the Virginia Constitution or the Virginia
Act for Religious Freedom contributed separately to the judgment
from which this appeal was taken. The parties have not attempted
to resuscitate them in their briefs or at oral argument. To bring
grounds for relief to the attention of an appellate tribunal,
the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure oblige the parties to
offer a written argument ... contain[ing] [their] contentions
... with respect to the issues presented, and the reasons therefor,
with citations to the authorities ... and parts of the record
relied on.
<P>
Fed.R.App.P. 28(a)(5), (b). We observe that none of the briefs
filed by either party in this court contains &quot;contentions&quot;
about the application of the Virginia Constitution's Declaration
of Rights or the Virginia Act for Religious Freedom to the instant
case, or &quot;citations to ... authorities&quot; that might illuminate
the special rights the state charter and religious-freedom statute
are said to guarantee. We therefore are compelled to conclude
that the parties have failed to appeal the district court's grant
of summary judgment with respect to these state-law theories of
recovery. Failure of this nature constitutes abandonment of the
claims, and precludes us from considering them further herein.
See Shopco Distrib. Co. v. Commanding Gen., 885 F.2d 167, 170
n. 3 (4th Cir.1989) (noting that failure to comply with terms
of former version of Fed.R.App.P. 28(a)(5) constitutes waiver
of asserted claims).
<P>
*277 Therefore, the scope of our inquiry is confined to such of
the plaintiffs' assignments of error as rest upon the Constitution
of the United States. These are two. (FN23) First, the plaintiffs
contend that the guidelines' proscription of SAF funding for &quot;religious
activities&quot; violates the Free Speech and Press Clause of
the First Amendment (1) by depriving them of government benefits
based solely on the content and viewpoint of their speech in Wide
Awake, and (2) by excluding them from the &quot;limited public
forum&quot; represented by the SAF. Second, the plaintiffs argue
that the guidelines' funding restrictions discriminate against
them in contravention of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment (1) by denying them benefits which other CIOs engaged
in religious speech and activities have received, and (2) because
the restrictions serve no compelling state interest, and are not
narrowly tailored to satisfy whatever minimal interest the Rector
and Visitors may have in denying funding to &quot;religious activit[ies].&quot;
In the discussion that follows, we address these two claims in
turn, reviewing the legal conclusions on which the district court
granted summary judgment de novo. See, e.g., Brock v. Entre Computer
Ctrs., Inc., 933 F.2d 1253, 1259 (4th Cir.1991).
<P>
III
<P>
First, we examine the plaintiffs' contention that the guidelines'
proscription of SAF funding for &quot;religious activities&quot;
violates the Free Speech and Press Clause of the First Amendment
by depriving the members of Wide Awake Productions of government
benefits based solely on the content and viewpoint of their speech
in Wide Awake.
<P>
A
<P>
Because our decision rests ultimately upon our understanding of
the language of the First Amendment, we here undertake cursory
review of certain principles of constitutional interpretation
that guide our deliberations.
<P>
Like their cultural and ideological ancestors the Magna Carta
(1215) and the English Bill of Rights (1688), the first ten amendments
to the Federal Constitution represent what Justice Story called
&quot;a solemn recognition of limitations upon the power of parliament;
that is, a declaration, that parliament ought not to abolish,
or restrict&quot; certain fundamental rights of the person. III
Joseph Story, Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States
Sec. 980, at 695 (1833). Taken as a whole, the provisions of the
Bill of Rights form a stout bulwark against government encroachment
upon the fundamental liberties of every person within the jurisdiction
of the United States. The amendments weigh as a counterpoise to
the specifically enumerated powers granted by the people of the
several states to their national government in the first three
Articles of the Federal Constitution.
<P>
By its terms the Free Speech and Press Clause of the First Amendment
reflects the limiting purpose of the Bill of Rights. The Clause
pronounces the federal legislature's impotence to curb any individual's
freedom to express verbally her views upon any subject; it states
that Congress shall &quot;make no law ... abridging the freedom
of speech, or of the press.&quot; U.S. Const. amend. I, cl. 3
(emphasis added). While the First Amendment thus represents a
guarantee that freedom will be preserved in the face of legislative
ambition, it goes no further. Although the Amendment preserves
inviolate the individual's right to speak, it sustains speech
itself only indirectly. The Speech and Press Clause cannot be
metamorphosed into a promise that the federal government will
purchase a bullhorn, paper, and ink for the convenience of every
garrulous member of the American populace. The Constitution does
not guarantee the American people the means of self-expression;
it simply pledges that Congress (and, through application of *278
the Fourteenth Amendment, the states (FN24)) will not enact laws
or regulations restraining at its inception a person's right freely
to speak her views and to disseminate them by every means at her
disposal. A century and six decades after the publication of his
commentaries on our national charter, Justice Story's expression
of this principle retains all its peerless power:
<P>
That this amendment was intended to secure to every citizen an
absolute right to speak, or write, or print, whatever he might
please, without any responsibility, public or private, therefor,
is a supposition too wild to be indulged by any rational man....
It is plain, then, that the language of the amendment imports
no more, than that every man shall have a right to speak, write,
and print his opinions upon any subject whatsoever, without prior
restraint....
<P>
Story, supra, Sec. 993, at 703-04.
<P>
B
<P>
With these interpretative precepts firmly in hand, we turn to
the assignment of error lodged by the plaintiffs.
<P>
The plaintiffs do not suggest that the Rector and Visitors have
restrained them from speaking, writing, or printing commentary
upon religious themes, or indeed upon any other subject, on the
campus or within the purview of the University of Virginia. As
they freely admit, Wide Awake Productions is afforded the full
benefits of CIO status by the University. Its members are granted
the same access to meeting rooms on University grounds as other
CIOs, and are given generous run of University property for their
work and programs. The University affords Wide Awake Productions
liberal recourse to its computer terminals, printers, and other
equipment used to prepare manuscripts for publication. With the
University's full consent, the plaintiffs have thus far distributed
several thousand copies of Wide Awake on University grounds. The
plaintiffs do not, indeed cannot, suggest, therefore, that the
Rector and Visitors have placed a per se unconstitutional prior
restraint upon their freedom actually to speak or to publish their
views by denying them equal access to University facilities. Cf.
Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 277, 102 S.Ct. 269, 278, 70 L.Ed.2d
440 (1981) (discussing erection of prior restraint against student
organization's use of state university property); Healy v. James,
408 U.S. 169, 180, 92 S.Ct. 2338, 2345, 33 L.Ed.2d 266 (1972)
(same).
<P>
Nor is the plaintiffs' complaint simply that the Rector and Visitors
have refused to pay for the publication of their speech with treasure
from the University fisc. If such were the nature of this dispute,
we might leave the field of independent analysis fallow. For there
is no question that the Commonwealth of Virginia, like any private
owner of property, may preserve the land and chattels under its
control for the use to which they are dedicated, and decline to
lend them for other purposes. E.g., Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches
Union Free Sch. Dist., --- U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 2141, 2146,
124 L.Ed.2d 352 (1993); Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense &amp;
Educ. Fund, Inc., 473 U.S. 788, 800, 105 S.Ct. 3439, 3447-3448,
87 L.Ed.2d 567 (1985); Perry Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educators'
Ass'n, 460 U.S. 37, 46, 103 S.Ct. 948, 955, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983).
As agents of the Commonwealth, the Rector and Visitors need not
subsidize extracurricular student activities in any form. Healy
v. James, 408 U.S. 169, 182 n. 8, 92 S.Ct. 2338, 2346 n. 8, 33
L.Ed.2d 266 (1972). Having undertaken such subsidies, they need
not have promulgated criteria by which the Student Council could
differentiate between competing funding requests. Nor are the
Rector and Visitors under any affirmative obligation to ensure
that University students' expressive *279 activities are funded.
In language redolent of Justice Story's pointed commentary on
the Speech and Press Clause, the Supreme Court has rejected the
notion that the rights of freedom of speech and freedom of the
press &quot;are somehow not fully realized unless they are subsidized
by the state.&quot; Regan v. Taxation with Representation, 461
U.S. 540, 546, 103 S.Ct. 1997, 2001, 76 L.Ed.2d 129 (1983).
<P>
The Student Council's exercise of discretion in withholding SAF
monies from Wide Awake Productions is not, therefore, the basis
of the plaintiffs' complaint. The plaintiffs contend, instead,
that once the Rector and Visitors have chosen to promulgate guidelines
governing the allocation of funds that support student speech
among competing student interests, such guidelines cannot condition
funding awards on the content or viewpoint of a prospective recipient's
speech. The Rector and Visitors have violated the First Amendment,
the plaintiffs maintain, by denying them the benefit of a University-funded
SAF grant on grounds that their publication of Wide Awake constitutes
a &quot;religious activit[y]&quot; (FN25) within the meaning of
the guidelines. Such discrimination contravenes the First Amendment,
they assert, because it implicitly condemns the content and viewpoint
of their speech in Wide Awake. This content and viewpoint discrimination
imposes a prior restraint upon the ability of Wide Awake Productions
to enjoy government largesse, and, the plaintiffs contend, must
therefore be struck down.
<P>
C
<P>
Having identified the constitutional character of the plaintiffs'
first assignment of error, we proceed to seek its resolution.
<P>
The notion that, whenever a government benefit or privilege might
be withheld altogether, it may be withheld on whatever conditions
government chooses to impose, has been thoroughly repudiated by
the Supreme Court since the middle of this century. See, e.g.,
Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 405, 83 S.Ct. 1790, 1794-1795,
10 L.Ed.2d 965 (1963); Speiser v. Randall, 357 U.S. 513, 518,
526, 78 S.Ct. 1332, 1338, 1342, 2 L.Ed.2d 1460 (1958); see also
Laurence H. Tribe, American Constitutional Law Sec. 11-5, at 781-84
(2d ed. 1988) (discussing &quot;elusive&quot; distinction between
withholding a government subsidy for and imposing a penalty upon
exercise of a constitutional right).
<P>
Unconstitutional conditions, which make enjoyment of a government
benefit contingent on sacrifice of an independent constitutional
right, are prima facie invalid. For if the government could deny
a benefit to a person because of his constitutionally protected
speech ..., his exercise of th[at] freedom[ ] would in effect
be penalized and inhibited. This would allow the government to
&quot;produce a result which [it] could not command directly.&quot;
Such interference with constitutional rights is impermissible.
<P>
Perry v. Sindermann, 408 U.S. 593, 597, 92 S.Ct. 2694, 2697, 33
L.Ed.2d 570 (1972) (quoting Speiser, 357 U.S. at 526, 78 S.Ct.
at 1342). Whether a condition is unconstitutional depends on whether
the government may properly demand sacrifice of the particular
right asserted in the context of its exercise. FCC v. League of
Women Voters, 468 U.S. 364, 380, 395, 104 S.Ct. 3106, 3117, 3125,
82 L.Ed.2d 278 (1984).
<P>
We must decide whether the guidelines' prohibition against funding
&quot;religious activities&quot; *280 imposes an unconstitutional
condition upon receipt of the government benefit inherent in an
award of SAF monies by infringing the plaintiffs' claimed First
Amendment right to indulge religious expression. This decision
harbors a two-part inquiry. First, we must determine whether the
publication of Wide Awake constitutes &quot;speech&quot; protected
by the Speech and Press Clause of the First Amendment. If we so
decide, we then must ask whether the Rector and Visitors are imposing
an unconstitutional condition upon the exercise of the plaintiffs'
protected speech; that is, we must determine whether the Rector
and Visitors are demanding that the members of Wide Awake Productions
cease publishing religious speech in Wide Awake before they may
become eligible (FN26) for an award of SAF funds.
<P>
1.
<P>
With respect to the first part of this inquiry, we easily conclude
that the plaintiffs' publication of religious speech in Wide Awake
falls within the protective ambit of the Speech and Press Clause.
There is no question that discussions of religion are, as they
long have been, a form of speech protected by the First Amendment.
See, e.g., Heffron v. International Soc'y for Krishna Consciousness,
Inc., 452 U.S. 640, 647, 101 S.Ct. 2559, 2563-2564, 69 L.Ed.2d
298 (1981); Saia v. New York, 334 U.S. 558, 561-62, 68 S.Ct. 1148,
1150-51, 92 L.Ed. 1574 (1948). Although the Rector and Visitors'
prohibition of SAF funding for &quot;religious activities&quot;
is not directed exclusively at religious speech, the phrase &quot;religious
activit[y]&quot; as defined in the guidelines necessarily encompasses
speech that &quot;primarily promotes or manifests a particular
belief[ ] in or about a deity or an ultimate reality.&quot; The
word &quot;activity&quot; is defined as &quot;an occupation, pursuit,
or recreation in which a person is active,&quot; Webster's Third
New International Dictionary 22 (1976).
<P>
There can be no doubt that the publication of a journal of religious
expression is precisely such an occupation, pursuit, or recreation.
<P>
2.
<P>
Having answered the first prong of the inquiry affirmatively,
we address the second prong: Have the Rector and Visitors effectively
demanded that the members of Wide Awake Productions cease publishing
religious commentary in Wide Awake before they may become &quot;eligible&quot;
for an award of SAF funds? We conclude that they have.
<P>
The guidelines lay upon the Student Council an affirmative obligation
not to fund &quot;religious activit[ies].&quot; This obligation
means that religious expression, such as that in Wide Awake, is
never allowed to compete for funds with other forms of speech
that might be indulged by University students. Even if a student
organization achieves CIO status, to the extent that its pursuits
and functions consist of religious speech, the organization's
funding requests will be summarily rejected by the Student Council.
In effect, then, the Rector and Visitors' restriction has operated
to erect a prior restraint on University subsidization of all
forms of religious expression in which a CIO might engage. While
we acknowledge that a CIO has no right to funding by the Rector
and Visitors, see, e.g., Lamb's Chapel v. Center Moriches Union
Free Sch. Dist., --- U.S. ----, ----, 113 S.Ct. 2141, 2146, 124
L.Ed.2d 352 (1993), when funds are made available to CIOs generally,
*281 they must be distributed in a viewpoint-neutral manner, absent
considerations of equal constitutional dignity. See Board of Educ.
v. Mergens, 496 U.S. 226, 248, 110 S.Ct. 2356, 2370-71, 110 L.Ed.2d
191 (1990) (plurality opinion); Grand Rapids Sch. Dist. v. Ball,
473 U.S. 373, 382, 105 S.Ct. 3216, 3221-22, 87 L.Ed.2d 267 (1985);
<P>
Roemer v. Board of Pub. Works, 426 U.S. 736, 746, 96 S.Ct. 2337,
2344-45, 49 L.Ed.2d 179 (1976) (plurality opinion); Everson v.
Board of Educ., 330 U.S. 1, 18, 67 S.Ct. 504, 513, 91 L.Ed. 711
(1947). Although government need not subsidize exercise of a constitutional
right, the lack of an affirmative duty of financial support does
not mean that government may, in general, penalize exercise of
constitutional rights by withholding from their possessors an
otherwise discretionary benefit.
<P>
We conclude that the Rector and Visitors' erection of a prior
restraint against University funding of such &quot;religious activities&quot;
as the publication of religious expression in Wide Awake constitutes
precisely such a penalty, because it restrains Wide Awake Productions
from gaining access altogether to a funding source generally available
to CIOs not engaged in religious expression. (FN27) This prior
restraint ultimately forces the members of Wide Awake Productions--unlike
their nonsectarian CIO colleagues--to seek financial sustenance
for their speech from coffers outside the University. The Rector
and Visitors' funding proscription thus creates an uneven playing
field on which the advantage is tilted towards CIOs engaged in
wholly secular modes of expression.
<P>
We hold, therefore, that the Rector and Visitors have conditioned
the plaintiffs' receipt of government benefits upon their foregoing
constitutionally protected religious expression.
<P>
D
<P>
In reaching and forbidding funding for speech that meets the definition
of &quot;religious activity,&quot; but not for speech of other
types, the SAF guidelines discriminate among speech on the basis
of its content. Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481
U.S. 221, 229-30, 107 S.Ct. 1722, 1727-28, 95 L.Ed.2d 209 (1987).
In order to justify differential treatment of funding eligibility
based on the content of the speech involved, &quot;the State must
show that its regulation is necessary to serve a compelling state
interest and is narrowly drawn to achieve that end.&quot; Id.
at 231, 107 S.Ct. at 1729; see also Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S.
263, 270, 102 S.Ct. 269, 274, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981); Carey v.
Brown, 447 U.S. 455, 461, 464-65, 100 S.Ct. 2286, 2290, 2292-93,
65 L.Ed.2d 263 (1980); Healy v. James, 408 U.S. 169, 184, 92 S.Ct.
2338, 2347-48, 33 L.Ed.2d 266 (1972). It is to this inquiry that
we now turn.
<P>
In defense of the guidelines' prohibition, the Rector and Visitors
claim a compelling interest in maintaining strict separation of
church and state. (FN28) They derive this interest *282 from the
Establishment Clause of the First Amendment, which admonishes
Congress (and, through application of the Fourteenth Amendment,
the states (FN29)) to &quot;make no law respecting an establishment
of religion.&quot; U.S. Const. amend. I, cl. 1. The Rector and
Visitors argue that they cannot fund &quot;religious activities&quot;
without violating the Establishment Clause.
<P>
We agree with the Rector and Visitors that their interest as state
officials in complying with federal constitutional obligations,
including avoiding the creation of an &quot;establishment&quot;
of religion at the University of Virginia, may be characterized
as compelling. See Widmar, 454 U.S. at 271, 102 S.Ct. at 275.
It does not follow, however, that offering Wide Awake Productions
an equal opportunity to compete for SAF funds necessarily would
be incompatible with the Establishment Clause. Id.
<P>
That government largesse ultimately should redound to the benefit
of persons engaged in promoting religion does not necessarily
entail violation of the Establishment Clause. If such were the
case, &quot;a church could not be protected by the police and
fire departments, or have its public sidewalk kept in repair.&quot;
Id. at 274-75, 102 S.Ct. at 277. Moreover, such an extreme position
is plainly contrary to many of the Supreme Court's decisions upholding
government aid to parochial elementary and secondary schools.
See, e.g., Zobrest v. Catalina Foothills Sch. Dist., --- U.S.
----, ---- - ----, 113 S.Ct. 2462, 2466-67, 125 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993)
(summarizing the Court's Establishment Clause jurisprudence with
respect to government aid to parochial schools).
<P>
To test the Rector and Visitors' Establishment Clause justification
for the guidelines' funding policy, then, we must consider whether
awarding SAF monies to the members of Wide Awake Productions to
defray the publication costs of Wide Awake would constitute an
&quot;establishment of religion&quot; at the University of Virginia.
In making this determination, we seek enlightenment in the Supreme
Court's Establishment Clause jurisprudence. That jurisprudence
holds that a governmental policy will not offend the Establishment
Clause if it can pass constitutional muster under the three-pronged
test of Lemon v. Kurtzman, 403 U.S. 602, 91 S.Ct. 2105, 29 L.Ed.2d
745 (1971), which guides &quot;[t]he general nature of our inquiry
in this area,&quot; Mueller v. Allen, 463 U.S. 388, 394, 103 S.Ct.
3062, 3066, 77 L.Ed.2d 721 (1983):
<P>
First, the [governmental policy] must have a secular legislative
purpose; second, its principal or primary effect must be one that
neither advances nor inhibits religion ...; finally, the [policy]
must not foster an excessive government entanglement with religion.
<P>
Lemon, 403 U.S. at 612-13, 91 S.Ct. at 2111-12. (FN30) *283 In
the paragraphs that follow, we consider the Rector and Visitors'
Establishment Clause justification for prohibiting SAF funding
of &quot;religious activities&quot; in light of Lemon. (FN31)
<P>
1.
<P>
Lemon 's first prong focuses on the &quot;purpose that animated&quot;
the Rector and Visitors' adoption of the SAF funding guidelines,
Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 U.S. 578, 585, 107 S.Ct. 2573, 2578,
96 L.Ed.2d 510 (1987), and asks whether that purpose was secular.
<P>
The obvious point of departure for analyzing the purpose of the
guidelines is the Rector and Visitors' comments at the time of
their adoption. Although the guidelines are the result of largely
undocumented deliberations by the Rector and Visitors, and thus
cannot be said to possess a &quot;legislative history&quot; as
that term usually is understood, they do contain a &quot;Student
Activity Fee Statement of Purpose&quot; relevant to our deliberations.
This statement reads:
<P>
The purpose of the student activity fee is to provide financial
support for student organizations that are related to the educational
purpose of the University of Virginia. As a required student fee,
the monies collected by the University for funding student activities
are public funds which must be administered in a manner consistent
with the educational purpose of the University as well as with
state and federal law.
<P>
The funding guidelines themselves, which immediately follow the
&quot;Student Activity Fee Statement of Purpose&quot; and are
part of the *284 same document, were adopted by the Rector and
Visitors in an attempt to give practical effect to the SAF's goal
of providing financial support for student organizations related
to the University's educational purpose. In the third section
of the guidelines, titled &quot;Student Expenditures and Activities
Not Eligible for Funding,&quot; the Rector and Visitors proscribed
funding of &quot;religious activities&quot; on the ground that
such activities &quot;do not relate to the educational purpose
of the University.&quot;
<P>
These statements make clear that the Rector and Visitors' aim
in denying SAF funding to &quot;religious activities&quot; was
to comply with the University of Virginia's educational function--a
facially secular legislative purpose. (FN32) Because religion
is taught and studied as a subject of formal academic inquiry
at the University, however, the plaintiffs contend that religious
expression forms part of the institution's educational &quot;purpose.&quot;
They argue, therefore, that the University, already having admitted
religious discussion formally into the academic curriculum, can
have no stake in depriving such discussion of access to its coffers,
even if the source of the discussion is a student organization.
<P>
We disagree. That religion is studied at the University does not
mean that offering SAF funding to Wide Awake would promote the
essentially secular &quot;educational purpose&quot; of the institution,
or that such funding necessarily would not threaten the Establishment
Clause. Since its founding by Thomas Jefferson in the second decade
of the nineteenth century, the University's educational purpose
has included teaching and scholarship on a wide array of subjects,
(FN33) including the organized study of religious systems. As
the plaintiffs note, while serving as Rector of the University
Jefferson explained that no professorship of divinity had been
established &quot;in conformity with the principles of [the] constitution,
which place all sects of religion on an equal footing,&quot; but
that arrangements would be made to allow various denominations
to establish schools &quot;on the confines of the University&quot;
and to allow them access to University facilities. 19 The Writings
of Thomas Jefferson 408 (A. Bergh ed., 1905) (report to University
Visitors dated Oct. 7, 1822). That such &quot;schools&quot; were
incorporated into the University's intellectual and academic life
does not prevent the Rector and Visitors from employing funding
restrictions to advance the &quot;secular purpose&quot; of avoiding
an establishment of religion at the institution.
<P>
As we see it, it is clear from the SAF's statement of purpose
that the funding guidelines were motivated primarily, if not entirely,
by a legitimate secular purpose--the advancement of the University
of Virginia's educational mission. We do not question the propriety
of, nor the secular motivation for, the Rector and Visitors' interest
in preserving University funds for the institution's educational
mission. The Rector and Visitors do not dispute that, on the whole,
religious concerns were not the sole motivation behind the guidelines.
See Lynch v. Donnelly, 465 U.S. 668, 680, 104 S.Ct. 1355, 1362,
79 L.Ed.2d 604 (1984). The record gives us no reason to doubt
that the Rector and Visitors' expressed purposes are &quot;sincere
and not a sham.&quot; Id. at 687, 104 S.Ct. at 1366. Therefore,
we hold that the guidelines' proscription against funding of &quot;religious
activit[ies]&quot; is not motivated wholly by an impermissible
purpose, and does not offend the Establishment Clause.
<P>
2.
<P>
As is usual in Establishment Clause cases, see, e.g., Grand Rapids
School Dist. v. Ball, 473 U.S. 373, 383-98, 105 S.Ct. 3216, 3222-30,
*285 87 L.Ed.2d 267 (1985), the more subtle question is whether
the primary effect of the guidelines restrictions is to inhibit
or advance religion. See Lemon, 403 U.S. at 613, 91 S.Ct. at 2111.
<P>
Although we concluded above that the prohibition against funding
&quot;religious activities&quot; denies religious speech the same
access to the SAF accorded secular speech, and thus violates the
Speech and Press Clause, whether &quot;religion&quot; is thereby
inhibited or advanced is a different matter. The Rector and Visitors
have not attempted to ban the publication of Wide Awake; indeed,
they have supported its religious mission by allowing the members
of Wide Awake Productions access to University meeting and printing
facilities equal to that afforded all other CIOs. The University
permits the plaintiffs to distribute Wide Awake on its grounds
without limitation.
<P>
Notwithstanding its refusal to subsidize the journal directly,
the University's sustenance of religion in these incidental respects
does not, in our view, inhibit religion. The University's policy
of allowing the members of Wide Awake Productions open access
to campus facilities accords the plaintiffs ample opportunity
to express their religious views, and leaves the University community
as a whole free to read and consider them. The Rector and Visitors'
funding policy simply declines to take the additional step of
actively subscribing University funds to Wide Awake 's particular
religious perspective. Under such circumstances as these, we are
unpersuaded that the primary effect of the guidelines restrictions,
involving as they do only the direct allocation of public monies,
would be to inhibit religion.
<P>
On the other hand, it would be difficult to view awarding SAF
monies to Wide Awake as anything but state sponsorship--and therefore
advancement--of religious belief. As the Constitution of Wide
Awake Productions attests, Wide Awake strives to challenge Christians
to live according to the faith they espouse, and to encourage
students at the University to consider &quot;what a personal relationship
with Jesus Christ means.&quot; Wide Awake, Nov.-Dec. 1990, at
2. The journal's contents--some of which are aimed at proselytizing
non-Christians--have pursued these goals indefatigably throughout
the three issues of Wide Awake represented in the record. Using
public funds to support a publication so clearly engaged in the
propagation of particular religious doctrines would constitute
a patent Establishment Clause violation. In the words of Justice
Powell:
<P>
Aid normally may be thought to have a primary effect of advancing
religion when it flows to an institution in which religion is
so pervasive that a substantial portion of its functions are subsumed
in the religious mission or when it funds a specifically religious
activity in an otherwise substantially secular setting.
<P>
Hunt v. McNair, 413 U.S. 734, 743, 93 S.Ct. 2868, 2874, 37 L.Ed.2d
923 (1973) (emphasis added). Here, then, we hold that the primary
effect of an SAF subsidy of Wide Awake 's publication costs would
be to advance religion.
<P>
3.
<P>
It is the third of the three Lemon criteria--whether the guidelines'
prohibition of funding for &quot;religious activities&quot; fosters
an excessive government entanglement with religion--that is most
plainly implicated by this case. Lemon, 403 U.S. at 613, 91 S.Ct.
at 2111. The constitutional prohibition against excessive church-state
entanglement reflects James Madison's concern that secular and
religious authorities must not interfere with each other's respective
spheres of choice and influence. See III Jonathan Elliott, Debates
on the Federal Constitution 431-32, 729-31 (1891) (remarks of
James Madison); Illinois ex rel. McCollum v. Board of Educ., 333
U.S. 203, 212, 68 S.Ct. 461, 465-66, 92 L.Ed. 649 (1948). (FN34)
The entanglement principle thus stems ultimately from fears, originally
propounded by the First Amendment's principal framer, that church-state
entanglement might strain the political system, compromise *286
liberty of conscience, and, ultimately, &quot;destroy government
and downgrade religion.&quot; Engel v. Vitale, 370 U.S. 421, 431,
82 S.Ct. 1261, 1267, 8 L.Ed.2d 601 (1961); Laurence H. Tribe,
American Constitutional Law Sec. 14-11, at 1226 (2d ed. 1988)
(summarizing the import of church-state entanglement).
<P>
The indirect and incidental conferral of a government benefit
to religious institutions has never been thought a sufficient
defect to warrant the invalidation of a state policy. Zobrest
v. Catalina Foothills Sch. Dist., --- U.S. ----, ---- - ----,
113 S.Ct. 2462, 2466-69, 125 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993); Widmar v. Vincent,
454 U.S. 263, 274-75, 102 S.Ct. 269, 276-77, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981);
<P>
Committee for Public Educ. &amp; Religious Liberty v. Nyquist,
413 U.S. 756, 775, 93 S.Ct. 2955, 2966, 37 L.Ed.2d 948 (1973).
Indeed, the Supreme Court has sanctioned awards of direct nonmonetary
benefits to religious groups where government has created open
fora to which all similarly situated organizations are invited.
In Widmar, for example, the Court held that a state university
which makes its facilities available to registered student groups
may not deny equal access to a registered student group desiring
to use those facilities for religious worship or discussion. 454
U.S. at 277, 102 S.Ct. at 278. Thus, although religious groups
may directly benefit from access to university facilities, a state
university may not discriminate against them based on the content
of their speech.
<P>
Direct monetary subsidization of religious organizations and projects,
however, is a beast of an entirely different color. A proper respect
for the Establishment Clause compels the Rector and Visitors to
pursue a course of &quot;neutrality&quot; toward religion. Yet
providing SAF monies to defray the publication costs of Wide Awake
inevitably would advance Wide Awake 's Christian mission: &quot;to
encourage students to consider what a personal relationship with
Jesus Christ means.&quot; Wide Awake, Nov.-Dec. 1990, at 2. The
potentially divisive political effect of such funding is a factor
of recurring significance in the Supreme Court's jurisprudence
surrounding Lemon 's &quot;excessive entanglement&quot; prong.
As Justice Black emphasized in Everson v. Board of Education,
330 U.S. 1, 67 S.Ct. 504, 91 L.Ed. 711 (1947), competition among
religious sects for political and religious supremacy has occasioned
considerable civil strife throughout history, &quot;generated
in large part&quot; by competing efforts to gain or maintain the
support of government. Id. at 8-9, 67 S.Ct. at 507-509. As we
see it, the &quot;potential for political divisiveness related
to religious belief and practice&quot; would be aggravated if
the University were to fund the publication of Wide Awake. The
possibility of a continuing annual appropriation for the benefit
of a single religion carries the potential for seriously divisive
political consequences at the University of Virginia. The prospect
of such divisiveness, as Justice Powell has admonished, is a &quot;warning
signal&quot; the Rector and Visitors would ignore at their, and
the University's, peril. Nyquist, 413 U.S. at 798, 93 S.Ct. at
2978.
<P>
Because Wide Awake is a journal pervasively devoted to the discussion
and advancement of an avowedly Christian theological and personal
philosophy, for the University to subsidize its publication would,
we believe, send an unmistakably clear signal that the University
of Virginia supports Christian values and wishes to promote the
wide promulgation of such values. Since offering SAF funds to
the members of Wide Awake Productions would excessively entangle
the University of Virginia with the propagation of the Christian
religion, we hold that the Rector and Visitors have proved the
existence of a compelling state interest in complying with the
Establishment Clause. This compelling interest justifies the Rector
and Visitors' decision to promulgate guidelines excluding the
membership of Wide Awake Productions from access to SAF monies.
<P>
E
<P>
It remains for us to consider whether the funding guidelines'
proscription against &quot;religious activities&quot; is sufficiently
circumscribed to survive the strictest judicial scrutiny.
<P>
The Supreme Court has held that a government policy is &quot;narrowly
tailored&quot; if it &quot;targets and eliminates no more than
the exact source of the 'evil' it seeks to remedy.&quot; Frisby
v. Schultz, 487 U.S. 474, 485, 108 S.Ct. 2495, 2503, 101 L.Ed.2d
420 (1988). If *287 the guidelines' &quot;religious activities&quot;
proscription had a substantial deleterious effect on the ability
of student organizations to engage in meaningful religious expression,
the plaintiffs' contention that the proscription is not narrowly
tailored might carry considerable force. Yet it is difficult for
us to conceive how the Rector and Visitors may avoid offending
the Establishment Clause without extending the prohibition on
SAF funding to all &quot;religious activities.&quot; Because the
First Amendment forbids government to promulgate policies &quot;respecting
an establishment of religion,&quot; government is left no choice
but to foreswear financial support of the myriad forms of religious
endeavor in which a student organization might engage. Hence,
we believe that the guidelines' declaration that student organizations
involved in &quot;religious activities&quot; as that phrase is
defined (FN35) is not &quot;substantially broader than necessary&quot;
to achieve the Rector and Visitors' legitimate constitutional
ends, City Council v. Taxpayers for Vincent, 466 U.S. 789, 808,
104 S.Ct. 2118, 2130, 80 L.Ed.2d 772 (1984), and thus satisfies
the requirement of narrow tailoring.
<P>
F
<P>
In summary, we conclude that the Rector and Visitors' refusal
to permit funding of &quot;religious activities&quot; places a
presumptively unconstitutional condition upon access to government
benefits in violation of the Free Speech and Press Clause of the
First Amendment. We further conclude, however, that the Rector
and Visitors have shown the existence of a compelling state interest
in (1) foregoing funding awards that would have the primary effect
of advancing religion at the University of Virginia, and (2) preserving
the University of Virginia from an excessive entanglement with
religion. Finally, the Rector and Visitors' restriction against
funding &quot;religious activities&quot; is narrowly tailored
to achieve this compelling state interest. Having survived the
strictest judicial scrutiny, the funding restriction cannot be
labelled constitutionally invalid under the Speech and Press Clause.
<P>
IV
<P>
The district court rejected the plaintiffs' contention that the
guidelines' proscription of funding for &quot;religious activities&quot;
violates the Free Speech and Press Clause by excluding them from
the &quot;limited public forum&quot; represented by the SAF. After
careful and reasoned consideration of the governing precedents,
see Cornelius v. NAACP Legal Defense &amp; Educ. Fund, Inc., 473
U.S. 788, 797, 105 S.Ct. 3439, 3446, 87 L.Ed.2d 567 (1985); Perry
Educ. Ass'n v. Perry Local Educators' Ass'n, 460 U.S. 37, 44,
103 S.Ct. 948, 954, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983), the court concluded
that the Rector and Visitors' systematic, purposeful exclusion
of certain student groups from access to SAF funds indicated that
the Rector and Visitors intended the SAF to be a nonpublic forum.
See Rosenberger v. Rector &amp; Visitors of Univ. of Va., 795
F.Supp. 175, 178-81 (W.D.Va.1992) (mem.)
<P>
We agree that the Rector and Visitors have not created a limited
public forum by awarding SAF funds only to those student organizations
which, in the view of University authorities, advance the institution's
essentially secular educational mission although we do so for
a different reason. As laid out in part III, supra, we believe
that the proper analysis of this case lies under the line of authority
dealing with content-based discrimination relating to government-generated
benefits or burdens. The long line of public forum cases have
taken &quot;forum&quot; in a fairly literalistic way involving
physical space, and we do not see how it advances the jurisprudence
to wrench that word out of its accepted form to encompass this
type of case already subject to First Amendment scrutiny.
<P>
V
<P>
We finally turn to the plaintiffs' contention that the guidelines'
prohibition against funding of &quot;religious activities&quot;
discriminates against them in contravention of the Equal Protection
Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment (1) by denying them benefits
which other CIOs engaged in religious speech and activities have
received, and (2) because the restrictions serve no compelling
state interest, *288. and are not narrowly tailored to satisfy
whatever interest the Rector and Visitors may have in denying
funding to &quot;religious activit[ies].&quot;
<P>
A
<P>
The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment provides
that no state shall &quot;deny to any person within its jurisdiction
the equal protection of the laws.&quot; U.S. Const. amend. XIV,
Sec. 1, cl. 4. The plaintiffs contend that the Rector and Visitors
have infringed their rights under the Equal Protection Clause
by awarding SAF monies to the Muslim Students Association, the
Jewish Law Students Association, and the C.S. Lewis Society while
denying funding to Wide Awake Productions.
<P>
To establish an equal protection violation, a plaintiff must show
discriminatory intent as well as disparate effect. See Crawford
v. Board of Educ., 458 U.S. 527, 544, 102 S.Ct. 3211, 3221, 73
L.Ed.2d 948 (1982);
<P>
Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252,
265, 97 S.Ct. 555, 563, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977); Washington v. Davis,
426 U.S. 229, 239, 96 S.Ct. 2040, 2047, 48 L.Ed.2d 597 (1976);
Irby v. Virginia State Bd. of Elections, 889 F.2d 1352, 1355 (4th
Cir.1989), cert. denied, 496 U.S. 906, 110 S.Ct. 2589, 110 L.Ed.2d
270 (1990). Upon careful review of the summary judgment record,
the district court found no evidence to indicate that the University's
denial of SAF funding to Wide Awake Productions was the product
of discriminatory intent. Because this finding is not contested
by the plaintiffs on appeal, we are constrained to hold that the
district court's factual findings on the point are not tainted
with clear error. Moreover, the plaintiffs' failure to argue the
existence of discriminatory intent as a matter of law on appeal
deprives us of jurisdiction to consider the merits of their equal
protection claim, and compels us to affirm the district court's
decision to grant summary judgment in favor of the Rector and
Visitors.
<P>
B
<P>
For the reasons stated in part III, supra, we already have held
that the Rector and Visitors' refusal to fund &quot;religious
activities&quot; serves the compelling state interest of preserving
the University of Virginia from an excessive entanglement with
religion, and is narrowly tailored to achieve that interest. We
therefore need not consider this question again for purposes of
the Fourteenth Amendment. The Rector and Visitors' stake in avoiding
an excessive entanglement with religion is equally strong in all
constitutional contexts, including that of the Equal Protection
Clause, if, as we hold, no prima facie violation of the plaintiffs'
equal protection rights exists. This assignment of error therefore
warrants no further discussion.
<P>
VI
<P>
For the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the district court
is hereby AFFIRMED.
<P>
FN1. See Va.Code Ann. Secs. 23-69 to -85 (Michie 1985 &amp; Supp.1993)
(delegating to the Rector and Visitors responsibility for governing
the affairs of the University, and setting forth procedures and
policies for the execution of this duty).
<P>
FN2. This case involves a challenge to the University's refusal
to fund a student organization engaged in religious expression.
Accordingly, we note that the guidelines offer definitions of
the phrases &quot;religious organization&quot; and &quot;religious
activity.&quot; A &quot;religious organization&quot; is defined
as &quot;an organization whose purpose is to practice a devotion
to an acknowledged ultimate reality or deity.&quot; The guidelines
define a &quot;religious activity&quot; as &quot;an activity which
primarily promotes or manifests a particular belief(s) in or about
a deity or an ultimate reality.&quot;

<P>
FN4. We note that the editors of Wide Awake would reject our use
of the noun &quot;journal&quot; to describe their publication:
<P>
We ... chose to call our magazine a perspective instead of a journal
or viewpoint. The word perspective embraces the idea of viewing
a situation from a particular angle (in this case a Christian
angle), rather than viewing a situation with a particular conclusion
in mind (as a politically partisan magazine would do). Our perspective
is a starting point, not a finish line.

[hereinafter Wide Awake ], Mar.-Apr. 1991, at 4. We employ the
<P>
nomenclature &quot;journal&quot; herein not to cast doubt upon
the editors' preference, but purely as a generic appellation;
thus, for our purposes a &quot;journal&quot; is simply &quot;[a]
periodical containing articles of interest to a particular group....,&quot;
Webster's II New Riverside University Dictionary 656 (1988); &quot;a
periodical publication dealing with matters of current interest....,&quot;
Webster's Third New International Dictionary 1221 (1976). This
usage comports with the editors' own description of Wide Awake
as &quot;a collection of articles exploring from within a Christian
framework various issues, both of widespread general interest
and of particular interest to Christians.&quot; Wide Awake, Mar./Apr.

<P>
FN25. The guidelines draw a distinction between &quot;religious
organizations&quot; and &quot;religious activities.&quot; &quot;Religious
organizations&quot; are student groups whose whole or primary
purpose is to practice devotion to an ultimate reality or deity;
such groups are wholly barred from receiving SAF funds. &quot;Religious
activities,&quot; on the other hand, are forms of conduct or behavior
that cannot, commensurate with the guidelines, be subsidized with
SAF monies. The result of the guidelines' identification of these
two categories, however, is the total proscription of SAF funding
for all forms of religious endeavor by CIOs at the University.
<P>
When the Student Council's Appropriations Committee, and later
the Student Activities Committee, informed Ronald W. Rosenberger
that Wide Awake Productions would not be the recipient of SAF
funds, they referred to the publication of Wide Awake as a &quot;religious
activity.&quot; It has not been suggested that the defendants
rejected the funding request because Wide Awake Productions constitutes
a &quot;religious organization.&quot; Hence we assume with the
parties that the denial of funding rested on a determination that
Wide Awake was &quot;an activity ... primarily promot[ing] or
manifest[ing] a particular belief(s) in or about a deity or an
ultimate reality.&quot;
<P>
FN26. The parties wrangle at considerable length over the question
whether Wide Awake Productions ever was &quot;eligible&quot; for
SAF funding at all. The plaintiffs contend that attainment of
CIO status by Wide Awake Productions made the organization &quot;eligible&quot;
to receive SAF monies. The Rector and Visitors argue that Wide
Awake Productions never was &quot;eligible&quot; for funding because
its central purpose--publication of Wide Awake--constituted a
&quot;religious activity.&quot; We need not address the merits
of these opposing positions, because we reject forthwith the Rector
and Visitors' suggestion that they be given unlimited discretion
to determine the &quot;eligibility&quot; of student groups for
SAF funding to the extent such discretion derogates the provisions
of the Bill of Rights. The duty of upholding (and therefore of
not wounding indirectly) the Federal Constitution devolves upon
the Rector and Visitors as a matter of law; as agents of the Commonwealth
of Virginia, the Rector and Visitors are bound to observe the
strictures of the First Amendment, and may not issue regulations
transgressing its bounds. As we note elsewhere herein, once SAF
funds are made available to student groups at the University,
they must be distributed in a viewpoint-neutral manner, absent
the showing of a compelling state interest.
<P>
*288_ FN27. We do not address the guidelines' prohibition of SAF
funding for such organizations as fraternities and sororities
or for such activities as social entertainment or philanthropic
contributions. Those excluded categories are not at issue in the
instant case. See supra note 2 and accompanying text.
<P>
FN28. In defense of their position, the Rector and Visitors cite
a number of recent decisions by the Supreme Court; without exception,
none of these cases are relevant to the question before us, and
we find it unnecessary to discuss them at length. For thoroughness'
sake, however, we observe that Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. 173,
111 S.Ct. 1759, 114 L.Ed.2d 233 (1991), on which the Rector and
Visitors lay great emphasis, did not involve the erection of a
prior restraint on abortion counseling by recipients of family
planning funds under Title X of the Public Health Service Act,
42 U.S.C. Secs. 300 to 330a-6a. In Rust, regulations issued by
the Secretary of Health and Human Services simply limited the
ability of Title X fund recipients to engage in abortion-related
expressive activities. Id. at 176-77, 111 S.Ct. at 1764. Although,
like the SAF funding restrictions at issue here, the regulations
broadly prohibited Title X projects from engaging in activities
that &quot;encourage[d], promote[d] or advocate[d] abortion as
a method of family planning,&quot; id. at 180, 111 S.Ct. at 1765,
there was no question that the recipients were recipients--that
is, that they already had received Title X funding. In his opinion
for the Court, Chief Justice Rehnquist emphasized this distinction:
<P>
Petitioners' reliance on [the Court's &quot;unconstitutional conditions&quot;
cases] is unavailing ... because here the government is not denying
a benefit to anyone, but is instead simply insisting that public
funds be spent for the purposes for which they were authorized.
<P>
Id. at 196, 111 S.Ct. at 1774. Thus, the issue in Rust was not--as
here--whether the recipients could obtain access to government
benefits. It was, instead, whether the government could be allowed
to dictate the use to which already-allocated funds could be dedicated.

FN30. As we are well-aware, the Supreme Court's applications of
Lemon have been characterized by fine distinctions, and have aroused
considerable controversy among the Justices themselves, even to
the point of frequent suggestion in nonmajority opinions that
Lemon be abandoned. We note, for example, Justice Scalia's recent
denunciation of Lemon:
<P>
Like some ghoul in a late-night horror movie that repeatedly sits
up in its grave and shuffles abroad, after being repeatedly killed
and buried, Lemon stalks our Establishment Clause jurisprudence
once again, frightening the little children....

<P>
*288_ FN31. We reject the plaintiffs' contention that the Supreme
Court's decision in Texas Monthly, Inc. v. Bullock, 489 U.S. 1,
109 S.Ct. 890, 103 L.Ed.2d 1 (1989) (plurality opinion), controls
our analysis of the Establishment Clause issue presented by this
case, and obviates the need to examine the guidelines' restrictions
in light of Lemon v. Kurtzman. Texas Monthly involved a state
sales tax exemption for &quot;[p]eriodicals that are published
or distributed by a religious faith and that consist wholly of
writings sacred to a religious faith.&quot; Texas Monthly, 489
U.S. at 5, 109 S.Ct. at 894. The Court held that the exemption
was insufficiently broad--that is, that it did not reach an adequately
wide class of publications--to pass Establishment Clause scrutiny.
<P>
If Texas Monthly has application in the instant case, it is only
as an extra pillar for our initial, but not dispositive, holding
that the SAF guidelines' &quot;religious activit[y]&quot; prohibition
has erected a presumptively unconstitutional prior restraint on
the receipt of a government benefit. In his opinion for a three-Justice
plurality, Justice Brennan stated:
<P>
[W]hen government directs a subsidy exclusively to religious organizations
that is not required by the Free Exercise Clause and that either
burdens nonbeneficiaries markedly or cannot reasonably be seen
as removing a significant state-imposed deterrent to free exercise
of religion ..., it &quot;provide[s] unjustifiable awards of assistance
to religious organizations&quot; and cannot but &quot;conve[y]
a message of endorsement&quot; to slighted members of the community.
This is particularly clear where, as here, the subsidy is targeted
at writings that promulgate the teachings of religious faiths.
<P>
Id. at 15, 109 S.Ct. at 899 (quoting Corporation of Presiding
Bishop of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints v. Amos,
483 U.S. 327, 348, 107 S.Ct. 2862, 2874-75, 97 L.Ed.2d 273 (1987)
(O'Connor, J., concurring in judgment)). As we explain below,
an award of SAF funds to defray publication costs of Wide Awake
would &quot;convey a message of endorsement&quot; of Christianity
to non-Christian members of the University of Virginia community.
&quot;This is particularly clear,&quot; id., because, as we observe,
such a subsidy would be targeted at a publication whose purpose
is &quot;to encourage students to consider what a personal relationship
with Jesus Christ means,&quot; Wide Awake, Nov.-Dec. 1990, at
2--a goal plainly contemplating the &quot;promulgat[ion]&quot;
of Christian teachings.
<P>
That Texas Monthly supports one wing of our analysis does not,
however, release us from the obligation of testing the Rector
and Visitors' asserted state interest in complying with the Establishment
Clause. Indeed, Justice Brennan's opinion addressed Texas's Establishment
Clause defense of its sales tax exemption by holding that the
exemption lacked sufficient breadth to pass scrutiny under Lemon.
See Texas Monthly, 489 U.S. at 8-17, 109 S.Ct. at 895-901. Because
this case involves a direct governmental subsidy of religious
expression rather than a mere exemption from the payment of duties,
it is not directly on point with Texas Monthly.

MEMORANDUM OPINION
<P>
MICHAEL, District Judge.
<P>
In this case, the court is asked to resolve the difficult question
of whether a &quot;student activities fund,&quot; comprised of
mandatory student fees, constitutes a limited public forum. For
the reasons set forth below, *177 the court concludes that the
answer to this riddle is &quot;no.&quot;
<P>
I.
<P>
In September of 1990, plaintiff Ronald W. Rosenberger, an undergraduate
student at the University of Virginia (the University), joined
with other University students to form Wide Awake Productions
(WAP). WAP is an unincorporated association officially recognized
by the University as a Contracted Independent Organization (CIO).
This recognition is given to all student organizations which execute
an annual agreement with the University and meet certain minimal
requirements. (FN1) The benefit of becoming a CIO is that such
organizations are given access to University facilities; i.e.
meeting rooms, computer terminals, etc.
<P>
WAP publishes Wide Awake Magazine (Wide Awake), a non-profit journal
written, edited and published by the student members of WAP. Mr.
Rosenberger serves as the magazine's publisher, while other named
plaintiffs include members of the management and editorial staff.
To date, three issues of Wide Awake have been published, with
approximately 5,000 copies of each issue distributed free of charge
to students on the University campus.
<P>
In January of 1991, WAP submitted an application for funding from
the University in the amount of $5,862.00 to offset the cost of
publishing its magazine. Specifically, WAP sought funding from
monies deposited in the University's Student Activities Fund (SAF).
The SAF is funded by a mandatory student activities fee collected
from every full-time student at the University. The activity fee
is designed to provide financial support for student organizations
related to the educational purposes of the University.
<P>
The defendants in this action, the Rector and Board of Visitors
of the University (the Board) (FN2) have ultimate responsibility
for the operation of the SAF. The Board has delegated the responsibility
of allocating SAF funds to the University's Student Council. The
Student Council disburses SAF funds to those CIOs deemed eligible
for funding as determined by Guidelines issued by the Board. These
Guidelines prohibit several categories of student organizations
from obtaining SAF funds. Ineligible groups include fraternities
and sororities, political and religious organizations, and those
groups whose membership is exclusionary in nature. Further, the
following expenditures and activities are also excluded by the
Guidelines: (1) honoraria or similar fees;
<P>
(2) religious activities; (3) social entertainment or related
expenses; (4) philanthropic contributions and activities; and
(5) political activities.
<P>
A CIO seeking SAF monies must first submit a request for funding
to the Student Council Appropriations Committee, a subcommittee
of the full Student Council. As noted earlier, WAP made its first
and only request for funding in January of 1991. The Chairman
of the Student Council denied the funding request because the
Appropriations Committee determined that publication of Wide Awake
constituted a &quot;religious activity.&quot; (FN3) WAP appealed
this decision to the full Student Council, which affirmed the
appropriation Committee's denial of funding. WAP pursued all internal
means of appeal before filing suit in this court on July 11, 1991.
The plaintiffs allege that the denial of SAF benefits violates
*178 their rights to freedom of speech, freedom of press, freedom
of association, free exercise of religion, and equal protection
of the laws in violation of the United States Constitution, the
Virginia Constitution, and the Virginia Act for Religious Freedom.
Plaintiffs have also set forth a cause of action pursuant to 42
U.S.C. Section 1983.
<P>
On November 12, 1991, the plaintiffs filed a motion for summary
judgment, asking this court for a declaratory judgment that the
defendants had indeed violated the plaintiff's constitutional
rights. The defendants filed a cross motion for summary judgment
and both sides appeared before this court for oral argument on
these motions. Both sides agree, with minor exceptions addressed
herein, that there are no genuine issues of material fact in conflict.
Thus, this matter is ripe for disposition. (FN4)
<P>
II. The Freedom of Speech Claims
<P>
The preliminary question for this court to resolve is whether
the University's SAF qualifies as a &quot;limited public forum&quot;
as the plaintiffs assert, or whether the SAF is in fact a &quot;non-public&quot;
forum, as the defendants argue. This determination is crucial
as it dictates the degree of scrutiny to be used by this court
in reviewing the Board of Visitor Guidelines. (FN5) See Perry
Educ. Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U.S. 37, 44,
103 S.Ct. 948, 954, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983) (&quot;The existence
of a right of access to public property and the standard by which
limitations upon such a right must be evaluated differ depending
on the character of the property at issue.&quot;) See also Cornelius
v. NAACP Legal Defense &amp; Educational Fund, Inc., 473 U.S.
788, 797, 105 S.Ct. 3439, 3446, 87 L.Ed.2d 567 (1985) (&quot;the
extent to which the Government may limit access [to a forum] depends
on whether the forum is public or nonpublic.&quot;)
<P>
The phrase &quot;limited public forum&quot; describes one of three
categories of fora identified by the Supreme Court in Perry, supra.
(FN6) A limited public forum is property &quot;which the State
has opened for use by the public even if it was not required to
create the forum in the first place.&quot; Perry, 460 U.S. at
45, 103 S.Ct. at 955 citing Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263, 102
S.Ct. 269, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981). A state may only restrict access
to limited public fora if such a restriction is narrowly drawn
to effectuate a compelling state interest.
<P>
Perry, 460 U.S. at 46, 103 S.Ct. at 955. A different category
of property consists of public property which is not &quot;by
tradition or designation a forum for public communication.&quot;
Id. Not surprisingly, this type of property is labeled &quot;nonpublic.&quot;
Access to such a forum can be limited by restrictions which are
&quot; 'reasonable and [are] not an effort to suppress expression
merely because the public officials oppose the speaker's view.'
&quot; Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 800, 105 S.Ct. at 3448 quoting Perry,
460 U.S. at 46, 103 S.Ct. at 955.
<P>
It should be apparent from the preceding discussion that the label
affixed to the University's SAF (either limited public forum or
nonpublic forum) will have a rather profound impact on whether
the Board's Guidelines will be upheld by this court. The plaintiffs
rely heavily on Gay and Lesbian Students Assn. v. Gohn, 850 F.2d
361 (8th Cir.1988) for the proposition that &quot;compulsory student
activities fees&quot; constitute a limited public forum. In Gohn,
the Gay and Lesbian Students Association (GLSA) at the University
of Arkansas at Fayetteville challenged the decision of the Student
Senate denying funding to the *179 group. The money was to be
paid out of funds from &quot;tuition, state tax money, and general
fees collected from students.&quot; Id. at 361. In finding that
the denial of funding violated GLSA's First Amendment rights,
the court stated:
<P>
we hold that a public body that chooses to fund speech or expression
must do so even-handedly, without discriminating among recipients
on the basis of their ideology. The University need not supply
funds to student organizations; but once having decided to do
so, it is bound by the First Amendment to act without regard to
the content of the ideas being expressed.
<P>
Id. at 362.
<P>
This court does not read Gohn at holding that a student activities
fund is a limited public forum. Gohn merely stands for the proposition
that  content-based discrimination can be justified only if the
government demonstrates that its regulation is narrowly drawn
and is necessary to effectuate compelling state interests.&quot;
Id. at 367 citing Widmar, 454 U.S. at 270, 102 S.Ct. at 274. The
plaintiffs read this citation to Widmar and the mention of a &quot;compelling
state interest&quot; as a signal that the Eighth Circuit considered
the student activity fee as creating a limited public forum, thus
requiring the use of a heightened level of scrutiny. This reading
of Gohn stretches the Eighth Circuit's opinion beyond the breaking
point.
<P>
The mere mention of heightened scrutiny does not in and of itself
indicate that the court is dealing with either a traditional or
a limited public forum.
<P>
Heightened scrutiny can also be applied even if the forum is characterized
as nonpublic. The Supreme Court recognized this in Perry by stating:
<P>
Public property which is not by tradition or designation a forum
for public communication is governed by different standards. We
have recognized that the 'First Amendment does not guarantee access
to property simply because it is owned or controlled by the government.'
In addition to time, place, and manner regulations, the State
may reserve the forum for its intended purposes, communicative
or otherwise, as long as the regulation on speech is reasonable
and not an effort to suppress expression merely because the public
officials oppose the speaker's view.
<P>
460 U.S. at 46, 103 S.Ct. at 955 (citations omitted).
<P>
This passage from Perry indicates that viewpoint discrimination
will rarely be tolerated, regardless of whether the restriction
applies to public, limited or nonpublic fora. Further, a careful
reading of Gohn indicates that the Eighth Circuit considered the
student service funds as creating a nonpublic forum. Specifically,
the court noted that:
<P>
We realize that the District Court made no explicit finding as
to the reason for denial of funding, that this is a question of
fact, and that appellate courts are not fact-finding forums. We
think, though, that the District Court's opinion, when read in
full and in context, includes an implicit finding that funds were
denied because of distaste for the GLSA's ideas. Otherwise, there
would have been no need to resort to the legal doctrines (e.g.
that there is no &quot;right&quot; to public money) used by the
Court to justify dismissing the complaint. A finding of fact that
funds were denied for some content-neutral reason would have sufficed
completely to dispose of the case. In any event, the facts of
this case are so obvious that a remand for an explicit finding
would be a waste of time. This record leaves no reasonable doubt
that funds were denied because of disagreement with GLSA's speech.
(emphasis added).
<P>
Gohn, 850 F.2d at 367. Here, the court indicates that GLSA would
have lost its case had the University of Arkansas put forth a
content neutral reason for denying funding. This is not the standard
used in limited public forum cases, but instead is the standard
used in nonpublic forum situations.
<P>
This court also looks to Cornelius, supra for guidance as to whether
the SAF qualifies as a public forum. Here, the Supreme Court began
its forum analysis by *180 noting that, &quot;[t]he government
does not create a public forum by inaction or by permitting limited
discourse, but only by intentionally opening a nontraditional
forum for public discourse.&quot; Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 802,
105 S.Ct. at 3449 citing Perry, 460 U.S. at 46, 103 S.Ct. at 955.
(emphasis added). In Cornelius, the Supreme Court held that the
Federal Government could exclude legal defense and political advocacy
organizations from participation in the Combined Federal Campaign
(CFC), a charity drive directed at federal employees. The Court
held that the campaign was a nonpublic forum because:
<P>
[t]he Government's consistent policy has been to limit participation
in the CFC to &quot;appropriate&quot; voluntary agencies and to
require agencies seeking admission to obtain permission from federal
and local Campaign officials ... The Civil Service Commission
and, after 1978, the Office of Personnel Management developed
extensive criteria to limit access to the Campaign to those organization
considered appropriate. Such selective access, unsupported by
evidence of a purposeful designation for public use, does not
create a public forum.
<P>
Cornelius, 473 U.S. at 804-5, 105 S.Ct. at 3450 (citations omitted).
<P>
In the present situation, the University has limited eligibility
for SAF monies to those organizations deemed &quot;appropriate.&quot;
Religious organizations are but one of several groups excluded
from participation in the SAF because the Board of Visitors has
decided that such groups do not further the educational purposes
of the University. This exclusion of religious groups and religious
activities has been in effect since the establishment of the Guidelines
in 1970, and has survived revisions in 1973, 1978, 1980 and 1991.

<P>
The plaintiffs attempt to counter this fact by arguing that &quot;the
defendants created the SAF mechanism to encourage the exchange
of opinions and viewpoints among students at the University of
Virginia in furtherance of the educational mission of the University.&quot;
In support of this assertion, the plaintiffs direct the court
to the page 1 of the Guidelines. The Guidelines, in pertinent
part, read as follows:
<P>
STATEMENT OF PURPOSE
<P>
The purpose of the student activity fee is to provide financial
support for student organizations that are related to the educational
purpose of the University of Virginia. As a required student fee,
the monies collected by the University for funding student activities
are public funds which must be administered in a manner consistent
with the educational purpose of the University as well as with
state and federal law.
<P>
This court does not read this passage to indicate a desire on
the part of the Board of Visitors to &quot;encourage the exchange
of opinions and viewpoints.&quot; Rather, the Guidelines suggest
that the SAF was established to fund only those CIOs whose activities
contributed to the educational focus of the University. The Board
of Visitors has not opened the SAF coffers to all CIOs; (FN7)
some groups, such as WAP, were excluded simply because the Board
of Visitors determined that their activities were not consistent
with the goals of the University. The consistent, purposeful exclusion
of certain groups indicates that the SAF is indeed a nonpublic
forum.
<P>
This conclusion is further supported by the Supreme Court's reasoning
in Perry, supra. The forum in Perry consisted of an interschool
mailing system used to facilitate communication between various
teachers. A teacher's union challenged the local Board of Education's
decision denying the union access to the system. The plaintiff
union argued that the school mail facilities became a limited
public forum because other private, non-school-connected groups
had previously been given access to the system. Perry, 460 U.S.
at 47, 103 S.Ct.
<P>
at 956. In rejecting this contention, the Court stated:
<P>
The use of the internal school mail by groups not affiliated with
the schools is no doubt a relevant consideration. If by policy
or by practice the Perry School *181 District has opened its mail
system for indiscriminate use by the general public, then PLEA
could justifiably argue a public forum has been created. This,
however, is not the case. As the case comes before us, there is
no indication in the record that the school mailboxes and interschool
delivery system are open for use by the general public. Permission
to use the system to communicate with teachers must be secured
from the individual building principal. There is no court finding
or evidence in the record which demonstrates that this permission
has been granted as a matter of course to all who seek to distribute
material. We can only conclude that the schools do allow some
outside organizations such as the YMCA, Cub Scouts, and other
civic and church organizations to use the facilities. This type
of selective access does not transform government property into
a public forum.
<P>
Id.
<P>
Similarly, the fact that the University has given certain CIOs
access to SAF funds does not lead to the conclusion that such
selective access transforms the SAF into a limited public forum.
<P>
Finally, the plaintiffs reliance on Widmar is misplaced. The present
case might very well be resolved in plaintiffs favor if the University
had denied CIO status to WAP. The defendants themselves take the
position that access to certification as a CIO is a limited public
forum. This is because only CIO's have access to University facilities.
(FN8) This is a far cry from the present situation and is the
reason why this court finds Widmar factually distinguishable from
the case at hand.
<P>
Having concluded that the SAF is a nonpublic forum, this court
must now determine whether the Board's Guidelines constitute restrictions
which are &quot;reasonable and not an effort to suppress expression
merely because public officials oppose the speaker' views.&quot;
Perry, 460 U.S. at 46, 103 S.Ct. at 955. The defendants offer
two basic rationales for excluding religious organizations such
as WAP from SAF eligibility. First, the University has only limited
funds to disburse and must therefore limit funding to those activities
which it determines advance its educational mission. Second, the
ineligibility of religious organizations and activities is justified
based on the Federal and State constitutional mandate of state
neutrality toward religion.
<P>
Although fiscal restraints are pertinent, this court may resolve
the reasonableness of the Guidelines by reference to the University's
second proffered reason. The parties devote considerable time
in their respective briefs addressing the obvious Establishment
Clause issues raised in this case. However, this court need not
resolve this issue on the facts of this case. For even if the
plaintiffs were correct in their assertion that funding Wide Awake
would not violate Federal or State law, it is not the province
of this court to second guess the legal judgments made by the
University. So long as the University's Establishment Clause fears
are reasonable, the Guideline restriction must stand. Given the
complexity of the law in this regard, this court has little trouble
in finding that the Guideline restriction is a reasonable limit
to access to SAF funds. Further, the restriction is a reasonable
response by the University to prevent excessive entanglement with
religion.
<P>
The court also finds that the Guideline limitations do not result
in viewpoint discrimination against religious organizations such
as WAP. The plaintiffs seem to argue that any across the board
restriction applied to a religious group results in content based
discrimination. This may be *182 true in the abstract, but this
court, and the University, must live in the real world. It could
be argued that every decision by the University results in viewpoint
discrimination. On this point, the court finds Justice Stevens'
comments in his concurring opinion in Widmar to be highly relevant.
Justice Stevens states that:
<P>
In performing their learning and teaching missions, the managers
of a university routinely make countless decisions based on the
content of communicative materials. They select books for inclusion
in the library, they hire professors on the basis of their academic
philosophies, they select courses for inclusion in the curriculum,
and they reward scholars for what they have written. In addition,
in encouraging students to participate in extracurricular activities,
they necessarily make decisions concerning the content of those
activities.
<P>
Widmar, 454 U.S. at 278, 102 S.Ct. at 278.
<P>
In brief, the plaintiffs' complaints about the Guidelines are
more properly directed at the wisdom and not the legality of the
restrictions. This is because the court finds, as a matter of
law, that the Board's Guidelines are reasonable and do not violate
any of the plaintiffs' constitutional rights. (FN9)
<P>
III. The Free Exercise of Religion Claims
<P>
The heart of the plaintiffs' claim is that without SAF monies
WAP must devote more time to fund raising and less time to publishing
its religious speech. Thus, the denial of funding burdens the
plaintiffs' free exercise of religion by diverting energy away
from WAP's main goal: challenging Christians to live according
to their faith.
<P>
Both sides agree that this court's analysis should begin with
Dole v. Shenandoah Baptist Church, 899 F.2d 1389 (4th Cir.) cert.
denied, --- U.S. ----, 111 S.Ct. 131, 112 L.Ed.2d 99 (1990). Here,
the Fourth Circuit stated that in reviewing a free exercise claim,
a court should:
<P>
... examine the burden on the exercise of ... [plaintiff's] sincerely
held religious beliefs, then determine whether the state presents
a compelling justification for imposing this burden, and finally
balancing the burden on free exercise against the state's ...
[compelling interest].
<P>
Id. at 1397.
<P>
In the present case, it is difficult for this court to identify
any burden of constitutional magnitude that has been imposed on
the plaintiffs. It is logical to assume that publishing a magazine
is easier if someone else pays the bills. However, if this incidental
burden was of constitutional significance, the free exercise clause
would be implicated in every funding decision involving a religious
organization. A review of the record indicates that WAP is unable
to point to any facts making their burden unique from other CIOs
which have been denied SAF monies. Political groups and fraternities
and sororities share a common plight with WAP: none of these groups
is eligible for funding. The only distinguishing factor is that
WAP engages in religious activity. However, WAP has not cited
this court to any authority indicating that religious organizations
should receive preferential access to a nonpublic forum.
<P>
The plaintiffs' attempt to bridge this gap in their argument by
asserting that &quot;freedom of expression may not be infringed
by denying a privilege.&quot;
<P>
WAP relies on Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 404, 83 S.Ct.
1790, 1794, 10 L.Ed.2d 965 (1963) to support this position. This
court does not read Sherbert as broadly as do the plaintiffs.
In Employment Div., Dept. of Human Resources v. Smith, 494 U.S.
872, 883, 110 S.Ct. 1595, 1602, 108 L.Ed.2d 876 (1990), the Court
stated that, &quot;[u]nder the Sherbert test, governmental actions
that substantially burden a religious practice must be justified
by a compelling governmental interest.&quot; (emphasis added).
This language *183 itself indicates that a burden must be substantial
before the court will consider whether the state has a compelling
reason for the restriction. (FN10) The Fourth Circuit appears
to have adopted this position in Goodall v. Stafford County School
Board, 930 F.2d 363 (4th Cir.) cert. denied --- U.S. ----, 112
S.Ct. 188, 116 L.Ed.2d 149 (1991). Here the court stated that
[w]here the state conditions receipt of an important benefit upon
conduct proscribed by a religious faith, or where it denies such
a benefit because of conduct mandated by religious belief, thereby
putting substantial pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior
and to violate his beliefs, a burden upon religion exists. While
the compulsion may be indirect, the infringement upon free exercise
is nonetheless substantial.
<P>
Goodall, 930 F.2d at 369 quoting Thomas v. Review Board of Indiana
Employment Security Division, 450 U.S. 707, 717-18, 101 S.Ct.
1425, 1432, 67 L.Ed.2d 624 (1981). (FN11)
<P>
Even if this court were to consider the Board's Guidelines as
imposing a burden on WAP's free exercise of religion, WAP is still
bound by the Fourth Circuit's holding in Goodall, supra, that
avoidance of a violation of the Establishment Clause constitutes
a compelling state interest. Goodall, 930 F.2d at 370. Further,
balancing the minimal burden on the plaintiffs with the defendants
rationale for the Guidelines indicates that the scale must come
down in favor of the defendants.
<P>
IV. The Equal Protection Claims
<P>
The last issue for the court to resolve in the plaintiffs' claims
that the Guidelines have been applied in less than an even-handed
manner. Put somewhat differently, the plaintiffs contend that
they have been denied equal protection of the laws because other
&quot;religious groups&quot; have been given SAF monies. As evidence
of this unequal treatment, WAP focuses on the funding decisions
make with respect to other CIOs.
<P>
The defendants seek to counter this argument by citing this court
to Irby v. Virginia State Board of Elections, 889 F.2d 1352 (4th
Cir.1989), cert. denied 496 U.S. 906, 110 S.Ct. 2589, 110 L.Ed.2d
270 (1990). Irby stands for the proposition that a plaintiff challenging
a facially neutral statute with an equal protection claim must
show not only disparate effect, but also discriminatory intent.
Thus, the defendants do not argue that the Student Council's funding
decisions are always correct. Instead, the defendants argue that
there is no evidence to suggest that the Student Council's decision
to deny funding to WAP resulted from discriminatory intent.
<P>
In their reply brief, the plaintiffs do not dispute the defendants
statement of the law nor the facts on this issue. The court has
reviewed the entire record independently, and cannot find any
evidence to indicate that the decision to deny funding to WAP
was based on discriminatory intent. Accordingly, summary judgment
in favor of the defendants is appropriate.
<P>
In summary, the court holds that access to the SAF is a nonpublic
forum upon which the University has imposed reasonable restrictions.
These restrictions do not impose an impermissible burden on the
plaintiffs' exercise of their rights as guaranteed by either the
Federal or State Constitutions, or the Virginia Act for Religious
Freedom. Thus, the court denies the plaintiffs' motion for summary
judgment and grants the defendants' cross motion for summary judgment.
An appropriate order shall this day issue.
<P>
ORDER
<P>
For the reasons set forth in the accompanying memorandum opinion,
it is hereby *184.
<P>
ADJUDGED AND ORDERED
<P>
that:
<P>
1. The plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment is denied;
<P>
2. The defendants' cross motion for summary judgment is granted.
<P>
This case shall be dismissed and stricken from the docket of the
court. The Clerk of the Court is hereby directed to send a certified
copy of this Order to all counsel of record.
<P>
FN1. There are four general criteria for CIO status: (1) at least
fifty-one percent of the group's members must be students; (2)
the group's officers must all be full-time, fee-paying students;
(3) the group must keep an updated copy of its constitution on
file with the University; and (4) the group must sign an anti-discrimination
disclaimer.
<P>
FN2. The individual Board members and Mr. Robert Stump, Associate
Dean of Students, are named defendants and are being sued in their
official capacities.
<P>
FN3. Mr. Rosenberger admits that Wide Awake is written from a
&quot;religious perspective.&quot; Further, Article 1 of WAP's
constitution states that the purpose of the organization is to:
(1) publish a magazine of philosophical and religious expressions;
(2) facilitate discussion which fosters an atmosphere of sensitivity
to and tolerance of Christian viewpoints; and (3) provide a unifying
focus for Christians of multicultural backgrounds.
<P>
FN4. The defendants have filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs'
claim for damages under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983 on the grounds that
such a claim is precluded by the Eleventh Amendment to the United
States Constitution. The court need not address this issue as
it has determined that all of the plaintiffs' claims must fail,
as a matter of law.
<P>
FN5. The plaintiffs have launched a general assault on the propriety
of certain exclusions in the Guidelines; i.e. those prohibiting
the funding of religious organizations and activities. Alternatively,
the plaintiffs set forth an equal protection claim by arguing
that the Guidelines have not been applied in an even-handed manner.
The court will address the equal protection issue in part IV of
this opinion.
<P>
FN6. The plaintiffs do not argue that the SAF is a traditional
public forum.
<P>
FN7. For the academic year 1990-91, 343 student organizations
qualified as CIOs. Of these 135 applied for SAF funds and 118
were actually allotted SAF monies.
<P>
FN8. The plaintiffs allege that they have been denied access to
certain University facilities yet have presented no evidence,
beyond Mr. Rosenberger's affidavit, to support of this claim.
For instance, there is no assertion that WAP has even attempted
to use University facilities or computers. The defendants have
submitted the affidavit of Mr. Stump, who swears that &quot;[a]s
a CIO, Wide Awake has been and is accorded the same access and
use of University facilities as other CIOs.&quot; The court has
considered this conflicting evidence in the light most favorable
to the plaintiffs, but comes to the conclusion that WAP has not
raised a genuine issue of material fact as to this issue.
<P>
FN9. In their briefs and in oral argument, the parties did not
separately address plaintiffs' claims under Federal and State
law. Although the court has focused on Federal Constitutional
law, the preceding analysis applies to the plaintiffs' claims
based on the Virginia Constitution and the Virginia Act for Religious
Freedom.
<P>
FN10. The court notes that the plaintiffs have not identified
a religious practice which is infringed by the Board's Guidelines.
Apparently the plaintiffs contend that publishing a religious
magazine is itself a religious practice.
<P>
FN11. The court also notes that with few exceptions, Sherbert
has been limited to those cases involving the denial of unemployment
compensation benefits. See Smith, supra, 494 U.S. at 883, 110
S.Ct. at 1602.

Syllabus (FN*)
<P>
Petitioner South Boston Allied War Veterans Council, an unincorporated
association of individuals elected from various veterans groups,
was authorized by the city of Boston to organize and conduct the
St. Patrick's Day-Evacuation Day Parade. The Council refused a
place in the 1993 event to respondent GLIB, an organization formed
for the purpose of marching in the parade in order to express
its members' pride in their Irish heritage as openly gay, lesbian,
and bisexual individuals, to show that there are such individuals
in the community, and to support the like men and women who sought
to march in the New York St. Patrick's Day parade. GLIB and some
of its members filed this suit in state court, alleging that the
denial of their application to march violated, inter alia, a state
law prohibiting discrimination on account of sexual orientation
in places of public accommodation. In finding such a violation
and ordering the Council to include GLIB in the parade, the trial
court, among other things, concluded that the parade had no common
theme other than the involvement of the participants, and that,
given the Council's lack of selectivity in choosing parade participants
and its failure to circumscribe the marchers' messages, the parade
lacked any expressive purpose, such that GLIB's inclusion therein
would not violate the Council's First Amendment rights. The Supreme
Judicial Court of Massachusetts affirmed.
<P>
Held: The state courts' application of the Massachusetts public
accommodations law to require private citizens who organize a
parade to include among the marchers a group imparting a message
that the organizers do not wish to convey violates the First Amendment.
Pp. 2343-2351.
<P>
(a) Confronted with the state courts' conclusion that the factual
characteristics of petitioners' activity place it within the realm
of non-expressive conduct, this Court has a constitutional duty
to conduct an independent examination of the record as a whole,
without deference to those courts, to assure that *2340 their
judgment does not constitute a forbidden
<P>
intrusion on the field of free expression. See, e.g., New York
Times Co. v.
<P>
Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 285, 84 S.Ct. 710, 729, 11 L.Ed.2d 686.
Pp.
<P>
2343-2345.
<P>
(b) The selection of contingents to make a parade is entitled
to First Amendment protection. Parades such as petitioners' are
a form of protected expression because they include marchers who
are making some sort of collective point, not just to each other
but to bystanders along the way. Cf., e.g., Gregory v. Chicago,
394 U.S. 111, 112, 89 S.Ct. 946, 946, 22 L.Ed.2d 134. Moreover,
such protection is not limited to a parade's banners and songs,
but extends to symbolic acts. See, e.g., West Virginia Bd. of
Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624, 632, 642, 63 S.Ct. 1178, 1182,
1187, 87 L.Ed. 1628. Although the Council has been rather lenient
in admitting participants to its parade, a private speaker does
not forfeit constitutional protection simply by combining multifarious
voices, by failing to edit their themes to isolate a specific
message as the exclusive subject matter of the speech, or by failing
to generate, as an original matter, each item featured in the
communication. Thus, petitioners are entitled to protection under
the First Amendment. GLIB's participation as a unit in the parade
was equally expressive, since the organization was formed to celebrate
its members' sexual identities and for related purposes. Pp. 2345-2346.
<P>
(c) The Massachusetts law does not, as a general matter, violate
the First or Fourteenth Amendments. Its provisions are well within
a legislature's power to enact when it has reason to believe that
a given group is being discriminated against. And the statute
does not, on its face, target speech or discriminate on the basis
of its content. Pp. 2346-2347.
<P>
(d) The state court's application, however, had the effect of
declaring the sponsors' speech itself to be the public accommodation.
Since every participating parade unit affects the message conveyed
by the private organizers, the state courts' peculiar application
of the Massachusetts law essentially forced the Council to alter
the parade's expressive content and thereby violated the fundamental
First Amendment rule that a speaker has the autonomy to choose
the content of his own message and, conversely, to decide what
not to say. Petitioners' claim to the benefit of this principle
is sound, since the Council selects the expressive units of the
parade from potential participants and clearly decided to exclude
a message it did not like from the communication it chose to make,
and that is enough to invoke its right as a private speaker to
shape its expression by speaking on one subject while remaining
silent on another, free from state interference. The constitutional
violation is not saved by Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v.
FCC, 512 U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 2445, 129 L.Ed.2d 497. The Council
is a speaker in its own right; a parade does not consist of individual,
unrelated segments that happen to be transmitted together for
individual selection by members of the audience; and there is
no assertion here that some speakers will be destroyed in the
absence of the Massachusetts law. Nor has any other legitimate
interest been identified in support of applying that law in the
way done by the state courts to expressive activity like the parade.

Justice SOUTER delivered the opinion of the Court.
<P>
The issue in this case is whether Massachusetts may require private
citizens who *2341 organize a parade to include among the marchers
a group imparting a message the organizers do not wish to convey.
We hold that such a mandate violates the First Amendment.
<P>
I
<P>
March 17 is set aside for two celebrations in South Boston. As
early as 1737, some people in Boston observed the feast of the
apostle to Ireland, and since 1776 the day has marked the evacuation
of royal troops and Loyalists from the city, prompted by the guns
captured at Ticonderoga and set up on Dorchester Heights under
General Washington's command. Washington himself reportedly drew
on the earlier tradition in choosing &quot;St. Patrick&quot; as
the response to &quot;Boston,&quot; the password used in the colonial
lines on evacuation day. See J. Crimmins, St. Patrick's Day: Its
Celebration in New York and other American Places, 1737-1845,
pp. 15, 19 (1902); see generally 1 H.S. Commager &amp; R. Morris,
The Spirit of 'Seventy Six 138-183 (1958); The American Book of
Days 262-265 (J. Hatch ed., 3d ed. 1978). Although the General
Court of Massachusetts did not officially designate March 17 as
Evacuation Day until 1938, see Mass.Gen.Laws Sec. 6:12K (1992),
the City Council of Boston had previously sponsored public celebrations
of Evacuation Day, including notable commemorations on the centennial
in 1876, and on the 125th anniversary in 1901, with its parade,
salute, concert, and fireworks display. See Celebration of the
Centennial Anniversary of the Evacuation of Boston by the British
Army (G. Ellis ed. 1876); Irish-American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual
Group of Boston v. City of Boston et al., Civ.Action No. 92-1516
(Super.Ct., Mass., Dec. 15, 1993), reprinted in App. to Pet. for
Cert. B1, B8-B9.
<P>
The tradition of formal sponsorship by the city came to an end
in 1947, however, when Mayor James Michael Curley himself granted
authority to organize and conduct the St. Patrick's Day-Evacuation
Day Parade to the petitioner South Boston Allied War Veterans
Council, an unincorporated association of individuals elected
from various South Boston veterans groups. Every year since that
time, the Council has applied for and received a permit for the
parade, which at times has included as many as 20,000 marchers
and drawn up to 1 million watchers. No other applicant has ever
applied for that permit. Id., at B9. Through 1992, the city allowed
the Council to use the city's official seal, and provided printing
services as well as direct funding.
<P>
1992 was the year that a number of gay, lesbian, and bisexual
descendants of the Irish immigrants joined together with other
supporters to form the respondent organization, GLIB, to march
in the parade as a way to express pride in their Irish heritage
as openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals, to demonstrate
that there are such men and women among those so descended, and
to express their solidarity with like individuals who sought to
march in New York's St. Patrick's Day Parade. Id., at B3; App.
51. Although the Council denied GLIB's application to take part
in the 1992 parade, GLIB obtained a state-court order to include
its contingent, which marched &quot;uneventfully&quot; among that
year's 10,000 participants and 750,000 spectators. App. to Pet.
for Cert. B3, and n. 4.
<P>
In 1993, after the Council had again refused to admit GLIB to
the upcoming parade, the organization and some of its members
filed this suit against the Council, the individual petitioner
John J. &quot;Wacko&quot; Hurley, and the City of Boston, alleging
violations of the State and Federal Constitutions and of the state
public accommodations law, which prohibits &quot;any distinction,
discrimination or restriction on account of ... sexual orientation
... relative to the admission of any person to, or treatment in
any place of public accommodation, resort or amusement.&quot;
Mass.Gen.Laws Sec. 272:98. After finding that &quot;[f]or at least
the past 47 years, the Parade has traveled the same basic route
along the public streets of South Boston, providing entertainment,
amusement, and recreation to participants and spectators alike,&quot;
App. to Pet. for Cert. B5-B6, the state trial court ruled that
the parade fell within the statutory definition of a public accommodation,
which includes &quot;any place ... which is open to and accepts
or solicits the patronage of the general public and, without limiting
*2342 the generality of this definition, whether or not it be
... (6) a boardwalk or other public highway [or] ... (8) a place
of public amusement, recreation, sport, exercise or entertainment,&quot;
Mass.Gen.Laws Sec. 272:92A. The court found that the Council had
no written criteria and employed no particular procedures for
admission, voted on new applications in batches, had occasionally
admitted groups who simply showed up at the parade without having
submitted an application, and did &quot;not generally inquire
into the specific messages or views of each applicant.&quot; App.
to Pet. for Cert. B8-B9. The court consequently rejected the Council's
contention that the parade was &quot;private&quot; (in the sense
of being exclusive), holding instead that &quot;the lack of genuine
selectivity in choosing participants and sponsors demonstrates
that the Parade is a public event.&quot; Id., at B6. It found
the parade to be &quot;eclectic,&quot; containing a wide variety
of &quot;patriotic, commercial, political, moral, artistic, religious,
athletic, public service, trade union, and eleemosynary themes,&quot;
as well as conflicting messages. Id., at B24. While noting that
the Council had indeed excluded the Ku Klux Klan and ROAR (an
antibusing group), id., at B7, it attributed little significance
to these facts, concluding ultimately that &quot;[t]he only common
theme among the participants and sponsors is their public involvement
in the Parade,&quot; id., at B24.
<P>
The court rejected the Council's assertion that the exclusion
of &quot;groups with sexual themes merely formalized [the fact]
that the Parade expresses traditional religious and social values,&quot;
id., at B3, and found the Council's &quot;final position [to be]
that GLIB would be excluded because of its values and its message,
i.e., its members' sexual orientation,&quot; id., at B4, n. 5,
citing Tr. of Closing Arg. 43, 51-52 (Nov. 23, 1993). This position,
in the court's view, was not only violative of the public accommodations
law but &quot;paradoxical&quot; as well, since &quot;a proper
celebration of St. Patrick's and Evacuation Day requires diversity
and inclusiveness.&quot; App. to Pet. for Cert. B24. The court
rejected the notion that GLIB's admission would trample on the
Council's First Amendment rights since the court understood that
constitutional protection of any interest in expressive association
would &quot;requir[e] focus on a specific message, theme, or group&quot;
absent from the parade. Ibid. &quot;Given the [Council's] lack
of selectivity in choosing participants and failure to circumscribe
the marchers' message,&quot; the court found it &quot;impossible
to discern any specific expressive purpose entitling the Parade
to protection under the First Amendment.&quot; Id., at B25. It
concluded that the parade is &quot;not an exercise of [the Council's]
constitutionally protected right of expressive association,&quot;
but instead &quot;an open recreational event that is subject to
the public accommodations law.&quot; Id., at B27.
<P>
The court held that because the statute did not mandate inclusion
of GLIB but only prohibited discrimination based on sexual orientation,
any infringement on the Council's right to expressive association
was only &quot;incidental&quot; and &quot;no greater than necessary
to accomplish the statute's legitimate purpose&quot; of eradicating
discrimination. Id., at B25, citing Roberts v. United States Jaycees,
468 U.S. 609, 628-629, 104 S.Ct. 3244, 3255-3256, 82 L.Ed.2d 462
(1984). Accordingly, it ruled that &quot;GLIB is entitled to participate
in the Parade on the same terms and conditions as other participants.&quot;
Id., at B27. (FN1)
<P>
The Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts affirmed, seeing nothing
clearly erroneous in the trial judge's findings that GLIB was
excluded from the parade based on the sexual orientation of its
members, that it was impossible to detect an expressive purpose
in the parade, that there was no state action, and that the parade
was a public accommodation within the meaning of Sec. 272:92A.
<P>
Irish- *2343 American Gay, Lesbian and Bisexual Group of Boston
v. Boston, 418 Mass. 238, 242-248, 636 N.E.2d 1293, 1295-1298
(1994). (FN2) Turning to petitioners' First Amendment claim that
application of the public accommodations law to the parade violated
their freedom of speech (as distinguished from their right to
expressive association, raised in the trial court), the court's
majority held that it need not decide on the particular First
Amendment theory involved &quot;because, as the [trial] judge
found, it is 'impossible to discern any specific expressive purpose
entitling the parade to protection under the First Amendment.'
&quot; Id., at 249, 636 N.E.2d, at 1299 (footnote omitted). The
defendants had thus failed at the trial level &quot;to demonstrate
that the parade truly was an exercise of ... First Amendment rights,&quot;
id., at 250, 636 N.E.2d, at 1299, citing Clark v. Community for
Creative Non-Violence, 468 U.S. 288, 293, n. 5, 104 S.Ct. 3065,
3069, n. 5, 82 L.Ed.2d 221 (1984), and on appeal nothing indicated
to the majority of the Supreme Judicial Court that the trial judge's
assessment of the evidence on this point was clearly erroneous,
ibid. The court rejected petitioners' further challenge to the
law as overbroad, holding that it does not, on its face, regulate
speech, does not let public officials examine the content of speech,
and would not be interpreted as reaching speech. Id., at 251-252,
636 N.E.2d, at 1300. Finally, the court rejected the challenge
that the public accommodations law was unconstitutionally vague,
holding that this case did not present an issue of speech and
that the law gave persons of ordinary intelligence a reasonable
opportunity to know what was prohibited. Id., at 252, 636 N.E.2d,
at 1300-1301.
<P>
Justice Nolan dissented. In his view, the Council &quot;does not
need a narrow or distinct theme or message in its parade for it
to be protected under the First Amendment.&quot; Id., at 256,
636 N.E.2d, at 1303. First, he wrote, even if the parade had no
message at all, GLIB's particular message could not be forced
upon it. Id., at 257, 636 N.E.2d, at 1303, citing Wooley v. Maynard,
430 U.S. 705, 717, 97 S.Ct. 1428, 1436, 51 L.Ed.2d 752 (1977)
(state requirement to display &quot;Live Free or Die&quot; on
license plates violates First Amendment). Second, according to
Justice Nolan, the trial judge clearly erred in finding the parade
devoid of expressive purpose. Ibid. He would have held that the
Council, like any expressive association, cannot be barred from
excluding applicants who do not share the views the Council wishes
to advance. Id., at 257-259, 636 N.E.2d, at 1303-1304, citing
Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 104 S.Ct. 3244,
82 L.Ed.2d 462 (1984). Under either a pure speech or associational
theory, the State's purpose of eliminating discrimination on the
basis of sexual orientation, according to the dissent, could be
achieved by more narrowly drawn means, such as ordering admission
of individuals regardless of sexual preference, without taking
the further step of prohibiting the Council from editing the views
expressed in their parade. Id., at 256, 258, 636 N.E.2d, at 1302,
1304. In Justice Nolan's opinion, because GLIB's message was separable
from the status of its members, such a narrower order would accommodate
the State's interest without the likelihood of infringing on the
Council's First Amendment rights. Finally, he found clear error
in the trial judge's equation of exclusion on the basis of GLIB's
message with exclusion on the basis of its members' sexual orientation.
To the dissent this appeared false in the light of &quot;overwhelming
evidence&quot; that the Council objected to GLIB on account of
its message and a dearth of testimony or documentation indicating
that sexual orientation was the bar to admission. Id., at 260,
636 N.E.2d, at 1304. The dissent accordingly concluded that the
Council had not even violated the State's public accommodations
law.
<P>
We granted certiorari to determine whether the requirement to
admit a parade contingent expressing a message not of the private
organizers' own choosing violates the First Amendment. 513 U.S.
----, 115 S.Ct. 714, 130 L.Ed.2d 621 (1995). We hold that it does
and reverse.
<P>

<P>
II
<P>
Given the scope of the issues as originally joined in this case,
it is worth noting some that have fallen aside in the course of
the litigation, before
<P>
reaching us. Although the Council presents us with a First Amendment
claim, respondents do not. Neither do they press a claim that
the Council's action has denied them equal protection of the laws
in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment. While the guarantees
of free speech and equal protection guard only against encroachment
by the government and &quot;erec[t] no shield against merely private
conduct,&quot; Shelley v. Kraemer, 334 U.S. 1, 13, 68 S.Ct. 836,
842, 92 L.Ed. 1161 (1948); see Hudgens v. NLRB, 424 U.S. 507,
513, 96 S.Ct. 1029, 1033, 47 L.Ed.2d 196 (1976), respondents originally
argued that the Council's conduct was not purely private, but
had the character of state action. The trial court's review of
the city's involvement led it to find otherwise, however, and
although the Supreme Judicial Court did not squarely address the
issue, it appears to have affirmed the trial court's decision
on that point as well as the others. In any event, respondents
have not brought that question up either in a cross-petition for
certiorari or in their briefs filed in this Court. When asked
at oral argument whether they challenged the conclusion by the
Massachusetts' courts that no state action is involved in the
parade, respondents' counsel answered that they &quot;do not press
that issue here.&quot; Tr. of Oral Arg. 22. In this Court, then,
their claim for inclusion in the parade rests solely on the Massachusetts
public accommodations law.
<P>
There is no corresponding concession from the other side, however,
and certainly not to the state courts' characterization of the
parade as lacking the element of expression for purposes of the
First Amendment. Accordingly, our review of petitioners' claim
that their activity is indeed in the nature of protected speech
carries with it a constitutional duty to conduct an independent
examination of the record as a whole, without deference to the
trial court. See Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States,
Inc., 466 U.S. 485, 499, 104 S.Ct. 1949, 1958, 80 L.Ed.2d 502
(1984). The &quot;requirement of independent appellate review
... is a rule of federal constitutional law,&quot; id., at 510,
104 S.Ct., at 1965, which does not limit our deference to a trial

rests upon us simply because the reaches of the First Amendment
are ultimately defined by the facts it is held to embrace, and
we must thus decide for ourselves whether a given course of conduct
falls on the near or far side of the line of constitutional protection.

to the provision of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(a) that

erroneous,&quot; we are obliged to make a fresh examination of
crucial facts. Hence, in this case, though we are confronted with
the state courts' conclusion that the factual characteristics
of petitioners' activity place it within the vast realm of non-expressive
conduct, our obligation is to &quot; 'make an independent examination
of the whole record,' ... so as to assure ourselves that th[is]
judgment does not constitute a forbidden intrusion on the field
of free expression.&quot; New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376

If there were no reason for a group of people to march from here
to there except to *2345 reach a destination, they could make
the trip without expressing any message beyond the fact of the
march itself. Some people might call such a procession a parade,
but it would not be much of one. Real &quot;[p]arades are public
dramas of social relations, and in them performers define who
can be a social actor and what subjects and ideas are available
for communication and consideration.&quot; S. Davis, Parades and
Power: Street Theatre in Nineteenth-Century Philadelphia 6 (1986).
Hence, we use the word &quot;parade&quot; to indicate marchers
who are making some sort of collective point, not just to each
other but to bystanders along the way. Indeed a parade's dependence
on watchers is so extreme that nowadays, as with Bishop Berkeley's
celebrated tree, &quot;if a parade or demonstration receives no
media coverage, it may as well not have happened.&quot; Id., at
171. Parades are thus a form of expression, not just motion, and
the inherent expressiveness of marching to make a point explains
our cases involving protest marches. In Gregory v. Chicago, 394
U.S. 111, 112, 89 S.Ct. 946, 947, 22 L.Ed.2d 134 (1969), for example,
petitioners had taken part in a procession to express their grievances
to the city government, and we held that such a &quot;march, if
peaceful and orderly, falls well within the sphere of conduct
protected by the First Amendment.&quot; Similarly, in Edwards
v. South Carolina, 372 U.S. 229, 235, 83 S.Ct. 680, 683, 9 L.Ed.2d
697 (1963), where petitioners had joined in a march of protest
and pride, carrying placards and singing The Star Spangled Banner,
we held that the activities &quot;reflect an exercise of these
basic constitutional rights in their most pristine and classic
form.&quot; Accord, Shuttlesworth v. Birmingham, 394 U.S. 147,
152, 89 S.Ct. 935, 939, 22 L.Ed.2d 162 (1969).
<P>
The protected expression that inheres in a parade is not limited
to its banners and songs, however, for the Constitution looks
beyond written or spoken words as mediums of expression. Noting
that &quot;[s]ymbolism is a primitive but effective way of communicating
ideas,&quot; West Virginia Bd. of Ed. v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624,
632, 63 S.Ct. 1178, 1182, 87 L.Ed. 1628 (1943), our cases have
recognized that the First Amendment shields such acts as saluting
a flag (and refusing to do so), id., at 632, 642, 63 S.Ct., at
1182, 1187, wearing an arm band to protest a war, Tinker v. Des
Moines Independent Community School Dist., 393 U.S. 503, 505-506,
89 S.Ct. 733, 735-736, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969), displaying a red
flag, Stromberg v. California, 283 U.S. 359, 369, 51 S.Ct. 532,
535, 75 L.Ed. 1117 (1931), and even &quot;[m]arching, walking
or parading&quot; in uniforms displaying the swastika, National
Socialist Party of America v. Skokie, 432 U.S. 43, 97 S.Ct. 2205,
53 L.Ed.2d 96 (1977). As some of these examples show, a narrow,
succinctly articulable message is not a condition of constitutional
protection, which if confined to expressions conveying a &quot;particularized
message,&quot; cf. Spence v. Washington, 418 U.S. 405, 411, 94
S.Ct. 2727, 2730, 41 L.Ed.2d 842 (1974) (per curiam ), would never
reach the unquestionably shielded painting of Jackson Pollock,
music of Arnold Schonberg, or Jabberwocky verse of Lewis Carroll.
<P>
Not many marches, then, are beyond the realm of expressive parades,
and the South Boston celebration is not one of them. Spectators
line the streets; people march in costumes and uniforms, carrying
flags and banners with all sorts of messages (e.g., &quot;England
get out of Ireland,&quot; &quot;Say no to drugs&quot;); marching
bands and pipers play, floats are pulled along, and the whole
show is broadcast over Boston television. See Record, Exh. 84
(video). To be sure, we agree with the state courts that in spite
of excluding some applicants, the Council is rather lenient in
admitting participants. But a private speaker does not forfeit
constitutional protection simply by combining multifarious voices,
or by failing to edit their themes to isolate an exact message
as the exclusive subject matter of the speech. Nor, under our
precedent, does First Amendment protection require a speaker to
generate, as an original matter, each item featured in the communication.
Cable operators, for example, are engaged in protected speech
activities even when they only select programming originally produced
by others. Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 512 U.S. ----,
----, 114 S.Ct. 2445, 2456, 129 L.Ed.2d 497 (1994) (slip op.,
at 11) (&quot;Cable programmers and cable operators engage in
and transmit speech, and they are entitled to the *2346 protection
of the speech and press provisions of the First Amendment&quot;).
For that matter, the presentation of an edited compilation of
speech generated by other persons is a staple of most newspapers'
opinion pages, which, of course, fall squarely within the core
of First Amendment security, Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo,
418 U.S. 241, 258, 94 S.Ct. 2831, 2840, 41 L.Ed.2d 730 (1974),
as does even the simple selection of a paid noncommercial advertisement
for inclusion in a daily paper, see New York Times, 376 U.S.,
at 265-266, 84 S.Ct., at 718-719. The selection of contingents
to make a parade is entitled to similar protection.
<P>
Respondents' participation as a unit in the parade was equally
expressive. GLIB was formed for the very purpose of marching in
it, as the trial court found, in order to celebrate its members'
identity as openly gay, lesbian, and bisexual descendants of the
Irish immigrants, to show that there are such individuals in the
community, and to support the like men and women who sought to
march in the New York parade. App. to Pet. for Cert. B3. The organization
distributed a fact sheet describing the members' intentions, App.
A51, and the record otherwise corroborates the expressive nature
of GLIB's participation, see Record, Exh. 84; App. A67 (photograph).
In 1993, members of GLIB marched behind a shamrock-strewn banner
with the simple inscription &quot;Irish American Gay, Lesbian
and Bisexual Group of Boston.&quot; GLIB understandably seeks
to communicate its ideas as part of the existing parade, rather
than staging one of its own.

The Massachusetts public accommodations law under which respondents
brought suit has a venerable history. At common law, innkeepers,
smiths, and others who &quot;made profession of a public employment,&quot;
were prohibited from refusing, without good reason, to serve a
customer. Lane v. Cotton, 12 Mod. 472, 484-485, 88 Eng.Rep. 1458,
1464-1465 (K.B.1701) (Holt, C.J.); see Bell v. Maryland, 378 U.S.
226, 298, n. 17, 84 S.Ct. 1814, 1853, n. 17, 12 L.Ed.2d 822 (1964)
(Goldberg, J., concurring); Lombard v. Louisiana, 373 U.S. 267,
277, 83 S.Ct. 1122, 1127, 10 L.Ed.2d 338 (1963) (Douglas, J.,
concurring). As one of the 19th century English judges put it,
the rule was that &quot;[t]he innkeeper is not to select his guests[;]
[h]e has no right to say to one, you shall come into my inn, and
to another you shall not, as every one coming and conducting himself
in a proper manner has a right to be received; and for this purpose
innkeepers are a sort of public servants.&quot; Rex v. Ivens,
7 Car. &amp; P. 213, 219, 173 Eng.Rep. 94, 96 (N.P.1835); M. Konvitz
&amp; T. Leskes, A Century of Civil Rights 160 (1961).
<P>
After the Civil War, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts was the
first State to codify this principle to ensure access to public
accommodations regardless of race. See Act Forbidding Unjust Discrimination
on Account of Color or Race, 1865 Mass. Acts, ch. 277 (May 16,
1865); Konvitz &amp; Leskes, supra, at 155-56; L.G. Lerman &amp;
A. Sanderson, Discrimination in Access to Public Places: A Survey
of State and Federal Public Accommodations Laws, 7 N.Y.U.Rev.L.
&amp; Soc. Change 215, 238 (1978); F. Fox, Discrimination and
Antidiscrimination in Massachusetts Law, 44 B.U.L.Rev. 30, 58
(1964). In prohibiting discrimination &quot;in any licensed inn,
in any public place of amusement, public conveyance or public
meeting,&quot; 1865 Mass.Acts, ch. 277, Sec. 1, the original statute
already expanded upon the common law, which had not conferred
any right of access to places of public amusement, Lerman &amp;
Anderson, supra, at 248. As with many public accommodations statutes
across the Nation, the legislature continued to broaden the scope
of legislation, to the point that the law today prohibits discrimination
on the basis of &quot;race, color, religious creed, national origin,
sex, sexual orientation ..., deafness, blindness or any physical
or mental disability or ancestry&quot; in &quot;the admission
of any person to, or treatment in any place of public accommodation,
resort or amusement.&quot; Mass.Gen.Laws Sec. 272:98. Provisions
like these are well within the State's usual power to enact when
a legislature has reason to believe that a given group is the
target of discrimination, and they do not, as a general matter,
violate the First or Fourteenth Amendments. See, e.g., New York
State Club Assn., Inc. v. City *2347 of New York, 487 U.S. 1,
11-16, 108 S.Ct. 2225, 2233-2236, 101 L.Ed.2d 1 (1988); Roberts
v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 624-626, 104 S.Ct. 3244,
3253-3254, 82 L.Ed.2d 462 (1984); Heart of Atlanta Motel, Inc.
v. United States, 379 U.S. 241, 258-262, 85 S.Ct. 348, 358-360,
13 L.Ed.2d 258 (1964). Nor is this statute unusual in any obvious
way, since it does not, on its face, target speech or discriminate
on the basis of its content, the focal point of its prohibition
being rather on the act of discriminating against individuals
in the provision of publicly available goods, privileges, and
services on the proscribed grounds.
<P>
C
<P>
In the case before us, however, the Massachusetts law has been
applied in a peculiar way. Its enforcement does not address any
dispute about the participation of openly gay, lesbian, or bisexual
individuals in various units admitted to the parade. The petitioners
disclaim any intent to exclude homosexuals as such, and no individual
member of GLIB claims to have been excluded from parading as a
member of any group that the Council has approved to march. Instead,
the disagreement goes to the admission of GLIB as its own parade
unit carrying its own banner. See App. to Pet. for Cert. B26-B27,
and n. 28. Since every participating unit affects the message
conveyed by the private organizers, the state courts' application
of the statute produced an order essentially requiring petitioners
to alter the expressive content of their parade. Although the
state courts spoke of the parade as a place of public accommodation,
see, e.g., 418 Mass., at 247-248, 636 N.E.2d, at 1297-1298, once
the expressive character of both the parade and the marching GLIB
contingent is understood, it becomes apparent that the state courts'
application of the statute had the effect of declaring the sponsors'
speech itself to be the public accommodation. Under this approach
any contingent of protected individuals with a message would have
the right to participate in petitioners' speech, so that the communication
produced by the private organizers would be shaped by all those
protected by the law who wished to join in with some expressive
demonstration of their own. But this use of the State's power
violates the fundamental rule of protection under the First Amendment,
that a speaker has the autonomy to choose the content of his own
message.
<P>
&quot;Since all speech inherently involves choices of what to
say and what to leave unsaid,&quot; Pacific Gas &amp; Electric
Co. v. Public Utilities Comm'n of Cal., 475 U.S. 1, 11, 106 S.Ct.
903, 909, 89 L.Ed.2d 1 (1986) (plurality opinion) (emphasis in
original), one important manifestation of the principle of free
speech is that one who chooses to speak may also decide &quot;what
not to say,&quot; id., at 16, 106 S.Ct., at 912. Although the
State may at times &quot;prescribe what shall be orthodox in commercial
advertising&quot; by requiring the dissemination of &quot;purely
factual and uncontroversial information,&quot; Zauderer v. Office
of Disciplinary Counsel of Supreme Court of Ohio, 471 U.S. 626,
651, 105 S.Ct. 2265, 2281, 85 L.Ed.2d 652 (1985); see Pittsburgh
Press Co. v. Pittsburgh Comm'n on Human Relations, 413 U.S. 376,
386-387, 93 S.Ct. 2553, 2559-2560, 37 L.Ed.2d 669 (1973), outside
that context it may not compel affirmance of a belief with which
the speaker disagrees, see Barnette, 319 U.S., at 642, 63 S.Ct.,
at 1187. Indeed this general rule, that the speaker has the right
to tailor the speech, applies not only to expressions of value,
opinion, or endorsement, but equally to statements of fact the
speaker would rather avoid, McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm'n,
514 U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 115 S.Ct. 1511, 1516, 131 L.Ed.2d
426 (1995); Riley v. National Federation of Blind of N.C., Inc.,
487 U.S. 781, 797-798, 108 S.Ct. 2667, 2678, 101 L.Ed.2d 669 (1988),
subject, perhaps, to the permissive law of defamation, New York
Times, 376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710; Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.,
418 U.S. 323, 347-349, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 3010-3012, 41 L.Ed.2d 789
(1974); Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell, 485 U.S. 46, 108 S.Ct.
876, 99 L.Ed.2d 41 (1988). Nor is the rule's benefit restricted
to the press, being enjoyed by business corporations generally
and by ordinary people engaged in unsophisticated expression as
well as by professional publishers. Its point is simply the point
of all speech protection, which is to *2348 shield just those
choices of content that in someone's eyes are misguided, or even
hurtful. See Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444, 89 S.Ct. 1827,
23 L.Ed.2d 430 (1969); Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U.S. 1, 69
S.Ct. 894, 93 L.Ed. 1131 (1949).
<P>
Petitioners' claim to the benefit of this principle of autonomy
to control one's own speech is as sound as the South Boston parade
is expressive. Rather like a composer, the Council selects the
expressive units of the parade from potential participants, and
though the score may not produce a particularized message, each
contingent's expression in the Council's eyes comports with what
merits celebration on that day. Even if this view gives the Council
credit for a more considered judgment than it actively made, the
Council clearly decided to exclude a message it did not like from
the communication it chose to make, and that is enough to invoke
its right as a private speaker to shape its expression by speaking
on one subject while remaining silent on another. The message
it disfavored is not difficult to identify. Although GLIB's point
(like the Council's) is not wholly articulate, a contingent marching
behind the organization's banner would at least bear witness to
the fact that some Irish are gay, lesbian, or bisexual, and the
presence of the organized marchers would suggest their view that
people of their sexual orientations have as much claim to unqualified
social acceptance as heterosexuals and indeed as members of parade
units organized around other identifying characteristics. The
parade's organizers may not believe these facts about Irish sexuality
to be so, or they may object to unqualified social acceptance
of gays and lesbians or have some other reason for wishing to
keep GLIB's message out of the parade. But whatever the reason,
it boils down to the choice of a speaker not to propound a particular
point of view, and that choice is presumed to lie beyond the government's
power to control.
<P>
Respondents argue that any tension between this rule and the Massachusetts
law falls short of unconstitutionality, citing the most recent
of our cases on the general subject of compelled access for expressive
purposes, Turner Broadcasting, 512 U.S. ----, 114 S.Ct. 2445.
There we reviewed regulations requiring cable operators to set
aside channels for designated broadcast signals, and applied only
intermediate scrutiny. Id., at ----, 114 S.Ct., at 2469. Respondents
contend on this authority that admission of GLIB to the parade
would not threaten the core principle of speaker's autonomy because
the Council, like a cable operator, is merely &quot;a conduit&quot;
for the speech of participants in the parade &quot;rather than
itself a speaker.&quot; Brief for Respondent 21. But this metaphor
is not apt here, because GLIB's participation would likely be
perceived as having resulted from the Council's customary determination
about a unit admitted to the parade, that its message was worthy
of presentation and quite possibly of support as well. A newspaper,
similarly, &quot;is more than a passive receptacle or conduit
for news, comment, and advertising,&quot; and we have held that
&quot;[t]he choice of material ... and the decisions made as to
limitations on the size and content ... and treatment of public
issues ...--whether fair or unfair--constitute the exercise of
editorial control and judgment&quot; upon which the State can
not intrude. Tornillo, 418 U.S., at 258, 94 S.Ct., at 2840. Indeed,
in Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, we invalidated coerced access to
the envelope of a private utility's bill and newsletter because
the utility &quot;may be forced either to appear to agree with
[the intruding leaflet] or to respond.&quot; 475 U.S., at 15,
106 S.Ct., at 911 (plurality) (citation omitted). The plurality
made the further point that if &quot;the government [were] freely
able to compel ... speakers to propound political messages with
which they disagree, ... protection [of a speaker's freedom] would
be empty, for the government could require speakers to affirm
in one breath that which they deny in the next.&quot; Id., at
16, 106 S.Ct., at 912. Thus, when dissemination of a view contrary
to one's own is forced upon a speaker intimately connected with
the communication advanced, the speaker's right to autonomy over
the message is compromised.
<P>
In Turner Broadcasting, we found this problem absent in the cable
context, because &quot;[g]iven cable's long history of serving
as a conduit for broadcast signals, there appears little risk
that cable viewers would assume *2349 that the broadcast stations
carried on a cable system convey ideas or messages endorsed by
the cable operator.&quot; 512 U.S., at ----, 114 S.Ct., at 2465.
We stressed that the viewer is frequently apprised of the identity
of the broadcaster whose signal is being received via cable and
that it is &quot;common practice for broadcasters to disclaim
any identity of viewpoint between the management and the speakers
who use the broadcast facility.&quot; Ibid., 512 U.S., at ----,
114 S.Ct., at 2466 (citation omitted); see id., at ----, 114 S.Ct.,
at 2480 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part)
(noting that Congress &quot;might ... conceivably obligate cable
operators to act as common carriers for some of their channels&quot;).
<P>
Parades and demonstrations, in contrast, are not understood to
be so neutrally presented or selectively viewed. Unlike the programming
offered on various channels by a cable network, the parade does
not consist of individual, unrelated segments that happen to be
transmitted together for individual selection by members of the
audience. Although each parade unit generally identifies itself,
each is understood to contribute something to a common theme,
and accordingly there is no customary practice whereby private
sponsors disavow &quot;any identity of viewpoint&quot; between
themselves and the selected participants. Practice follows practicability
here, for such disclaimers would be quite curious in a moving
parade. Cf. PruneYard Shopping Center v. Robins, 447 U.S. 74,
87, 100 S.Ct. 2035, 2044, 64 L.Ed.2d 741 (1980) (owner of shopping
mall &quot;can expressly disavow any connection with the message
by simply posting signs in the area where the speakers or handbillers
stand&quot;). Without deciding on the precise significance of
the likelihood of misattribution, it nonetheless becomes clear
that in the context of an expressive parade, as with a protest
march, the parade's overall message is distilled from the individual
presentations along the way, and each unit's expression is perceived
by spectators as part of the whole.
<P>
An additional distinction between Turner Broadcasting and this
case points to the fundamental weakness of any attempt to justify
the state court order's limitation on the Council's autonomy as
a speaker. A cable is not only a conduit for speech produced by
others and selected by cable operators for transmission, but a
franchised channel giving monopolistic opportunity to shut out
some speakers. This power gives rise to the government's interest
in limiting monopolistic autonomy in order to allow for the survival
of broadcasters who might otherwise be silenced and consequently
destroyed. The government's interest in Turner Broadcasting was
not the alteration of speech, but the survival of speakers. In
thus identifying an interest going beyond abridgment of speech
itself, the defenders of the law at issue in Turner Broadcasting
addressed the threshold requirement of any review under the Speech
Clause, whatever the ultimate level of scrutiny, that a challenged
restriction on speech serve a compelling, or at least important,
governmental object, see, e.g., Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, supra,
at 19, 106 S.Ct., at 913; Turner Broadcasting, supra, at ----,
114 S.Ct., at 2469; United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 377,
88 S.Ct. 1673, 1679, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968).
<P>
In this case, of course, there is no assertion comparable to the
Turner Broadcasting claim that some speakers will be destroyed
in the absence of the challenged law. True, the size and success
of petitioners' parade makes it an enviable vehicle for the dissemination
of GLIB's views, but that fact, without more, would fall far short
of supporting a claim that petitioners enjoy an abiding monopoly
of access to spectators. See App. to Pet. for Cert. B9;
<P>
Brief for Respondents 10 (citing trial court's finding that no
other applicant has applied for the permit). Considering that
GLIB presumably would have had a fair shot (under neutral criteria
developed by the city) at obtaining a parade permit of its own,
respondents have not shown that petitioners enjoy the capacity
to &quot;silence the voice of competing speakers,&quot; as cable
operators do with respect to program providers who wish to reach
subscribers, Turner Broadcasting, supra, at ----, 114 S.Ct., at
2466. Nor has any other legitimate interest been identified in
support of applying the Massachusetts statute in this way to expressive
activity like the parade. *2350 The statute, Mass.Gen.Laws Sec.
272:98, is a piece of protective legislation that announces no
purpose beyond the object both expressed and apparent in its provisions,
which is to prevent any denial of access to (or discriminatory
treatment in) public accommodations on proscribed grounds, including
sexual orientation. On its face, the object of the law is to ensure
by statute for gays and lesbians desiring to make use of public
accommodations what the old common law promised to any member
of the public wanting a meal at the inn, that accepting the usual
terms of service, they will not be turned away merely on the proprietor's
exercise of personal preference. When the law is applied to expressive
activity in the way it was done here, its apparent object is simply
to require speakers to modify the content of their expression
to whatever extent beneficiaries of the law choose to alter it
with messages of their own. But in the absence of some further,
legitimate end, this object is merely to allow exactly what the
general rule of speaker's autonomy forbids.
<P>
It might, of course, have been argued that a broader objective
is apparent: that the ultimate point of forbidding acts of discrimination
toward certain classes is to produce a society free of the corresponding
biases.
<P>
Requiring access to a speaker's message would thus be not an end
in itself, but a means to produce speakers free of the biases,
whose expressive conduct would be at least neutral toward the
particular classes, obviating any future need for correction.
But if this indeed is the point of applying the state law to expressive
conduct, it is a decidedly fatal objective. Having availed itself
of the public thoroughfares &quot;for purposes of assembly [and]
communicating thoughts between citizens,&quot; the Council is
engaged in a use of the streets that has &quot;from ancient times,
been a part of the privileges, immunities, rights, and liberties
of citizens.&quot; Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization,
307 U.S. 496, 515, 59 S.Ct. 954, 964, 83 L.Ed. 1423 (1939) (opinion
of Roberts, J.). Our tradition of free speech commands that a
speaker who takes to the street corner to express his views in
this way should be free from interference by the State based on
the content of what he says. See, e.g., Police Department of Chicago
v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 95, 92 S.Ct. 2286, 2290, 33 L.Ed.2d 212
(1972); cf. H. Kalven, Jr., A Worthy Tradition 6-19 (1988); O.
Fiss, Free Speech and Social Structure, 71 Iowa L.Rev. 1405, 1408-1409
(1986). The very idea that a noncommercial speech restriction
be used to produce thoughts and statements acceptable to some
groups or, indeed, all people, grates on the First Amendment,
for it amounts to nothing less than a proposal to limit speech
in the service of orthodox expression. The Speech Clause has no
more certain antithesis. See, e.g., Barnette, 319 U.S., at 642,
63 S.Ct., at 1187; Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, 475 U.S., at 20,
106 S.Ct., at 914. While the law is free to promote all sorts
of conduct in place of harmful behavior, it is not free to interfere
with speech for no better reason than promoting an approved message
or discouraging a disfavored one, however enlightened either purpose
may strike the government.
<P>
Far from supporting GLIB, then, Turner Broadcasting points to
the reasons why the present application of the Massachusetts law
can not be sustained. So do the two other principal authorities
GLIB has cited. In PruneYard, 447 U.S. 74, 100 S.Ct. 2035, to
be sure, we sustained a state law requiring the proprietors of
shopping malls to allow visitors to solicit signatures on political
petitions without a showing that the shopping mall owners would
otherwise prevent the beneficiaries of the law from reaching an
audience. But we found in that case that the proprietors were
running &quot;a business establishment that is open to the public
to come and go as they please,&quot; that the solicitations would
&quot;not likely be identified with those of the owner,&quot;
and that the proprietors could &quot;expressly disavow any connection
with the message by simply posting signs in the area where the
speakers or handbillers stand.&quot; Id., at 87, 100 S.Ct., at
2044. Also, in Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, supra, at 12, 106 S.Ct.,
at 909, we noted that PruneYard did not involve &quot;any concern
that access to this area might affect the shopping center owner's
exercise of his own right to speak: the owner did not even allege
that he objected to the content of the pamphlets....&quot; The
principle of speaker's *2351. autonomy was simply not threatened
in that case.
<P>
New York State Club Association is also instructive by the contrast
it provides. There, we turned back a facial challenge to a state
antidiscrimination statute on the assumption that the expressive
associational character of a dining club with over 400 members
could be sufficiently attenuated to permit application of the
law even to such a private organization, but we also recognized
that the State did not prohibit exclusion of those whose views
were at odds with positions espoused by the general club memberships.
487 U.S., at 13, 108 S.Ct. at 2234; see also Roberts, 468 U.S.,
at 627, 104 S.Ct. at 3254. In other words, although the association
provided public benefits to which a State could ensure equal access,
it was also engaged in expressive activity; compelled access to
the benefit, which was upheld, did not trespass on the organization's
message itself. If we were to analyze this case strictly along
those lines, GLIB would lose. Assuming the parade to be large
enough and a source of benefits (apart from its expression) that
would generally justify a mandated access provision, GLIB could
nonetheless be refused admission as an expressive contingent with
its own message just as readily as a private club could exclude
an applicant whose manifest views were at odds with a position
taken by the club's existing members.

Our holding today rests not on any particular view about the Council's
message but on the Nation's commitment to protect freedom of speech.
<P>
Disapproval of a private speaker's statement does not legitimize
use of the Commonwealth's power to compel the speaker to alter
the message by including one more acceptable to others. Accordingly,
the judgment of the Supreme Judicial Court is reversed and the
case remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
<P>
It is so ordered.

the city because it found that the city's actions did not amount
to inciting or assisting in the Council's violations of Sec. 272:98.
App. to Pet. for Cert. B12-B13. It also dismissed respondents'
First and Fourteenth Amendment challenge against the Council for
want of state action triggering the proscriptions of those Amendments.
Id., at B14-B22. Finally, the court did not reach the state constitutional
questions, since respondents had apparently assumed in their arguments
that those claims, too, depended for their success upon a finding
of state action and because of the court's holding that the public
accommodation statutes apply to the parade. Id., at B22.

FN2. Since respondents did not cross-appeal the dismissal of their
claims against the city, the Supreme Judicial Court declined to
reach those claims. 418 Mass., at 245, n. 12, 636 N.E.2d, at 1297.

R.A.V., Petitioner, v.
<P>
CITY OF ST. PAUL, MINNESOTA.
<P>
No. 90-7675.
<P>
Argued Dec. 4, 1991.
<P>
Decided June 22, 1992.
<P>

<P>
Syllabus (FN*)
<P>
After allegedly burning a cross on a black family's lawn, petitioner
R.A.V. was charged under, inter alia, the St. Paul, Minnesota,
Bias-Motivated Crime Ordinance, which prohibits the display of
a symbol which one knows or has reason to know &quot;arouses anger,
alarm or resentment in others on the basis of race, color, creed,
religion or gender.&quot; The trial court dismissed this charge
on the ground that the ordinance was substantially overbroad and
impermissibly content-based, but the State Supreme Court reversed.
It rejected the overbreadth claim because the phrase &quot;arouses
anger, alarm or resentment in others&quot; had been construed
in earlier state cases to limit the ordinance's reach to &quot;fighting
words&quot; within the meaning of this Court's decision in Chaplinsky
v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 572, 62 S.Ct. 766, 769, 86 L.Ed.
1031 a category of expression unprotected by the First Amendment.
The court also concluded that the ordinance was not impermissibly
content-based because it was narrowly tailored to serve a compelling
governmental interest in protecting the community against bias-motivated
threats to public safety and order.
<P>
Held: The ordinance is facially invalid under the First Amendment.
Pp.
<P>
2542-2550.
<P>
(a) This Court is bound by the state court's construction of the
ordinance as reaching only expressions constituting &quot;fighting
words.&quot; However, R.A.V.'s request that the scope of the Chaplinsky
formulation be modified, thereby invalidating the ordinance as
substantially overbroad, need not be reached, since the ordinance
unconstitutionally prohibits speech on the basis of the subjects
the speech addresses. P. 2542.
<P>
(b) A few limited categories of speech, such as obscenity, defamation,
and fighting words, may be regulated because of their constitutionally
proscribable content. However, these categories are not entirely
invisible to the Constitution, and government may not regulate
them based on hostility, or favoritism, towards a nonproscribable
message they contain. Thus the regulation of &quot;fighting words&quot;
may not be based on nonproscribable content. It may, however,
be underinclusive, addressing some offensive instances and leaving
other, equally offensive, ones alone, so long as the selective
prescription is not based on content, or there is no realistic
possibility that regulation of ideas is afoot. Pp. 2542-2547.
<P>
(c) The ordinance, even as narrowly construed by the State Supreme
Court, is facially unconstitutional because it imposes special
prohibitions on those speakers who express views on the disfavored
subjects of &quot;race, color, creed, religion or gender.&quot;
At the same time, it permits displays containing abusive invective
if they are not addressed to those topics. Moreover, in its practical
operation the ordinance goes beyond mere content, to actual viewpoint,
discrimination. Displays containing &quot;fighting words&quot;
that do not invoke the disfavored subjects would seemingly be
useable ad libitum by those arguing in favor of racial, color,
etc. tolerance and equality, but not by their opponents. St. Paul's
desire to communicate to minority groups that it does not condone
the &quot;group hatred&quot; of bias-motivated speech does not
justify selectively silencing speech on the basis of its content.
Pp. 2547-2549.
<P>
(d) The content-based discrimination reflected in the ordinance
does not rest upon the very reasons why the particular class of
speech at issue is proscribable, it is not aimed only at the &quot;secondary
effects&quot; *2541 of speech within the meaning of Renton v.
Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41, 106 S.Ct. 925, 89 L.Ed.2d
29, and it is not for any other reason the sort that does not
threaten censorship of ideas. In addition, the ordinance's content
discrimination is not justified on the ground that the ordinance
is narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest in ensuring
the basic human rights of groups historically discriminated against,
since an ordinance not limited to the favored topics would have
precisely the same beneficial effect. Pp. 2549-2550.

Justice SCALIA delivered the opinion of the Court.
<P>
In the predawn hours of June 21, 1990, petitioner and several
other teenagers allegedly assembled a crudely-made cross by taping
together broken chair legs. They then allegedly burned the cross
inside the fenced yard of a black family that lived across the
street from the house where petitioner was staying. Although this
conduct could have been punished under any of a number of laws,
(FN1) one of the two provisions under which respondent city of
St. Paul chose to charge petitioner (then a juvenile) was the
St. Paul Bias-Motivated Crime Ordinance, St. Paul, Minn.Legis.Code
Sec. 292.02 (1990), which provides:
<P>
&quot;Whoever places on public or private property a symbol, object,
appellation, characterization or graffiti, including, but not
limited to, a burning cross or Nazi swastika, which one knows
or has reasonable grounds to know arouses anger, alarm or resentment
in others on the basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender
commits disorderly conduct and shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.&quot;
<P>
Petitioner moved to dismiss this count on the ground that the
St. Paul ordinance was substantially overbroad and impermissibly
content-based and therefore facially invalid under the First Amendment.
(FN2) The trial court granted this motion, but the Minnesota Supreme
Court reversed. That court rejected petitioner's overbreadth claim
because, as construed in prior Minnesota cases, see, e.g., In
re Welfare of S.L.J., 263 N.W.2d 412 (Minn.1978), the modifying
phrase &quot;arouses anger, alarm or resentment in others&quot;
limited the reach of the ordinance to conduct that amounts to
&quot;fighting words,&quot; i.e., &quot;conduct that itself inflicts
injury or tends to incite immediate violence ...,&quot; In re
Welfare of R.A.V., 464 N.W.2d 507, 510 (Minn.1991) (citing Chaplinsky
v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 572, 62 S.Ct. 766, 769, 86 L.Ed.
1031 (1942)), and therefore the ordinance reached only expression
&quot;that the first amendment does not protect.&quot; 464 N.W.2d,
at 511. The court also concluded that the ordinance was not impermissibly
content-based because, in its view, &quot;the ordinance is a narrowly
tailored means toward accomplishing the compelling governmental
interest in protecting the community against bias-motivated *2542
threats to public safety and order.&quot; Ibid. We granted certiorari,
501 U.S. ----, 111 S.Ct. 2795, 115 L.Ed.2d 969 (1991).

In construing the St. Paul ordinance, we are bound by the construction
given to it by the Minnesota court. Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates
v. Tourism Co. of Puerto Rico, 478 U.S. 328, 339, 106 S.Ct. 2968,
2975-2976, 92 L.Ed.2d 266 (1986); New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S.
747, 769, n. 24, 102 S.Ct. 3348, 3361, n. 24, 73 L.Ed.2d 1113
(1982); Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U.S. 1, 4, 69 S.Ct. 894, 895-896,
93 L.Ed. 1131 (1949). Accordingly, we accept the Minnesota Supreme
Court's authoritative statement that the ordinance reaches only
those expressions that constitute &quot;fighting words&quot; within
the meaning of Chaplinsky. 464 N.W.2d, at 510-511. Petitioner
and his amici urge us to modify the scope of the Chaplinsky formulation,
thereby invalidating the ordinance as &quot;substantially overbroad,&quot;
Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 610, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 2914-2915,
37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973). We find it unnecessary to consider this
issue. Assuming, arguendo, that all of the expression reached
by the ordinance is proscribable under the &quot;fighting words&quot;
doctrine, we nonetheless conclude that the ordinance is facially
unconstitutional in that it prohibits otherwise permitted speech
solely on the basis of the subjects the speech addresses. (FN3)
<P>
The First Amendment generally prevents government from proscribing
speech, see, e.g., Cantwell v. Connecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 309-311,
60 S.Ct. 900, 905-906, 84 L.Ed. 1213 (1940), or even expressive
conduct, see, e.g., Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 406, 109 S.Ct.
2533, 2540, 105 L.Ed.2d 342 (1989), because of disapproval of
the ideas expressed. Content-based regulations are presumptively
invalid. Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. v. Members of N.Y. State Crime
Victims Bd., 502 U.S. ----, ---- - ----, 112 S.Ct. 501, ---- -
----, 116 L.Ed.2d 476 (1991) id., at ---- - ----, 112 S.Ct., at
---- - ---- (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment); Consolidated
Edison Co. of N.Y. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of N.Y., 447 U.S. 530,
536, 100 S.Ct. 2326, 2332-2333, 65 L.Ed.2d 319 (1980); Police
Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 95, 92 S.Ct. 2286, 2289-2290,
33 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972). From 1791 to the present, however, our
society, like other free but civilized *2543 societies, has permitted
restrictions upon the content of speech in a few limited areas,
which are &quot;of such slight social value as a step to truth
that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed
by the social interest in order and morality.&quot; Chaplinsky,
supra, 315 U.S., at 572, 62 S.Ct. at 762. We have recognized that
&quot;the freedom of speech&quot; referred to by the First Amendment
does not include a freedom to disregard these traditional limitations.
See, e.g., Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 77 S.Ct. 1304,
1 L.Ed.2d 1498 (1957) (obscenity); Beauharnais v. Illinois, 343
U.S. 250, 72 S.Ct. 725, 96 L.Ed. 919 (1952) (defamation); Chaplinsky
v. New Hampshire, supra, (&quot;fighting words&quot;); see generally
Simon &amp; Schuster, supra, 502 U.S., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at
---- (KENNEDY, J., concurring in judgment). Our decisions since
the 1960's have narrowed the scope of the traditional categorical
exceptions for defamation, see New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,
376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964); Gertz v. Robert
Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 41 L.Ed.2d 789 (1974);
see generally Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co., 497 U.S. 1, 13-17,
110 S.Ct. 2695, ----, 111 L.Ed.2d 1 (1990), and for obscenity,
see Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 37 L.Ed.2d
419 (1973), but a limited categorical approach has remained an
important part of our First Amendment jurisprudence.
<P>
We have sometimes said that these categories of expression are
&quot;not within the area of constitutionally protected speech,&quot;
Roth, supra, 354 U.S., at 483, 77 S.Ct., at 1308; Beauharnais,
supra, 343 U.S., at 266, 72 S.Ct., at 735; Chaplinsky, supra,
315 U.S., at 571-572, 62 S.Ct., at 768-769; or that the &quot;protection
of the First Amendment does not extend&quot; to them, Bose Corp.
v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., 466 U.S. 485, 504,
104 S.Ct. 1949, 1961, 80 L.Ed.2d 502 (1984); Sable Communications
of Cal., Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 124, 109 S.Ct. 2829, 2835,
106 L.Ed.2d 93 (1989). Such statements must be taken in context,
however, and are no more literally true than is the occasionally
repeated shorthand characterizing obscenity &quot;as not being
speech at all,&quot; Sunstein, Pornography and the First Amendment,
1986 Duke L.J. 589, 615, n. 146. What they mean is that these
areas of speech can, consistently with the First Amendment, be
regulated because of their constitutionally proscribable content
(obscenity, defamation, etc.)--not that they are categories of
speech entirely invisible to the Constitution, so that they may
be made the vehicles for content discrimination unrelated to their
distinctively proscribable content. Thus, the government may proscribe
libel; but it may not make the further content discrimination
of proscribing only libel critical of the government. We recently
acknowledged this distinction in Ferber, 458 U.S., at 763, 102
S.Ct., at 3357-3358, where, in upholding New York's child pornography
law, we expressly recognized that there was no &quot;question
here of censoring a particular literary theme....&quot; See also
id., at 775, 102 S.Ct., at 3364 (O'CONNOR, J., concurring) (&quot;As
drafted, New York's statute does not attempt to suppress the communication
of particular ideas&quot;).
<P>
Our cases surely do not establish the proposition that the First
Amendment imposes no obstacle whatsoever to regulation of particular
instances of such proscribable expression, so that the government
&quot;may regulate [them] freely,&quot; post, at 2552 (WHITE,
J., concurring in judgment). That would mean that a city council
could enact an ordinance prohibiting only those legally obscene
works that contain criticism of the city government or, indeed,
that do not include endorsement of the city government. Such a
simplistic, all-or-nothing-at-all approach to First Amendment
protection is at odds with common sense and with our jurisprudence
as well. (FN4) It is not true *2544 that &quot;fighting words&quot;
have at most a &quot;de minimis &quot; expressive content, ibid.,
or that their content is in all respects &quot;worthless and undeserving
of constitutional protection,&quot; post, at 2553; sometimes they
are quite expressive indeed. We have not said that they constitute
&quot;no part of the expression of ideas,&quot; but only that
they constitute &quot;no essential part of any exposition of ideas.&quot;
Chaplinsky, 315 U.S., at 572, 62 S.Ct., at 769 (emphasis added).
<P>
The proposition that a particular instance of speech can be proscribable
on the basis of one feature (e.g., obscenity) but not on the basis
of another (e.g., opposition to the city government) is commonplace,
and has found application in many contexts. We have long held,
for example, that nonverbal expressive activity can be banned
because of the action it entails, but not because of the ideas
it expresses--so that burning a flag in violation of an ordinance
against outdoor fires could be punishable, whereas burning a flag
in violation of an ordinance against dishonoring the flag is not.
See Johnson, 491 U.S., at 406-407, 109 S.Ct., at 2540-2541. See
also Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. ----, ---- - ----,
111 S.Ct. 2456, 2460-2461, 115 L.Ed.2d 504 (1991) (plurality);
id., at ---- - ----, 111 S.Ct., at 2465-2466 (SCALIA, J., concurring
in judgment); id., at ---- - ----, 111 S.Ct., at 2468-2469 (SOUTER,
J., concurring in judgment); United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S.
367, 376-377, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 1678-1679, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968).
Similarly, we have upheld reasonable &quot;time, place, or manner&quot;
restrictions, but only if they are &quot;justified without reference
to the content of the regulated speech.&quot; Ward v. Rock Against
Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 791, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 2753-2754, 105 L.Ed.2d
661 (1989) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Clark
v. Community for Creative Non-Violence, 468 U.S. 288, 298, 104
S.Ct. 3065, 3071, 82 L.Ed.2d 221 (1984) (noting that the O'Brien
test differs little from the standard applied to time, place,
or manner restrictions). And just as the power to proscribe particular
speech on the basis of a noncontent element (e.g., noise) does
not entail the power to proscribe the same speech on the basis
of a content element; so also, the power to proscribe it on the
basis of one content element (e.g., obscenity) does not entail
the power to proscribe it on the basis of other content elements.
<P>
*2545 In other words, the exclusion of &quot;fighting words&quot;
from the scope of the First Amendment simply means that, for purposes
of that Amendment, the unprotected features of the words are,
despite their verbal character, essentially a &quot;nonspeech&quot;
element of communication. Fighting words are thus analogous to
a noisy sound truck: Each is, as Justice Frankfurter recognized,
a &quot;mode of speech,&quot; Niemotko v. Maryland, 340 U.S. 268,
282, 71 S.Ct. 325, 333, 95 L.Ed. 267 (1951) (Frankfurter, J.,
concurring in result); both can be used to convey an idea; but
neither has, in and of itself, a claim upon the First Amendment.
As with the sound truck, however, so also with fighting words:
The government may not regulate use based on hostility--or favoritism--towards
the underlying message expressed. Compare Frisby v. Schultz, 487
U.S. 474, 108 S.Ct. 2495, 101 L.Ed.2d 420 (1988) (upholding, against
facial challenge, a content-neutral ban on targeted residential
picketing) with Carey v. Brown, 447 U.S. 455, 100 S.Ct. 2286,

that exempted labor picketing). (FN5)
<P>
The concurrences describe us as setting forth a new First Amendment
principle that prohibition of constitutionally proscribable speech
cannot be &quot;underinclusiv[e],&quot; post, at 2553 (WHITE,
J., concurring in judgment)--a First Amendment &quot;absolutism&quot;
whereby &quot;within a particular 'proscribable' category of expression,
... a government must either proscribe all speech or no speech
at all,&quot; post, at 2562 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment).
That easy target is of the concurrences' own invention. In our
view, the First Amendment imposes not an &quot;underinclusiveness&quot;
limitation but a &quot;content discrimination&quot; limitation
upon a State's prohibition of proscribable speech. There is no
problem whatever, for example, with a State's prohibiting obscenity
(and other forms of proscribable expression) only in certain media
or markets, for although that prohibition would be &quot;underinclusive,&quot;
it would not discriminate on the basis of content. See, e.g.,
Sable Communications, 492 U.S., at 124-126, 109 S.Ct., at 2835-2836
(upholding 47 U.S.C. Sec. 223(b)(1) (1988), which prohibits obscene
telephone communications).
<P>
Even the prohibition against content discrimination that we assert
the First Amendment requires is not absolute. It applies differently
in the context of proscribable speech than in the area of fully
protected speech. The rationale of the general prohibition, after
all, is that content discrimination &quot;rais[es] the specter
that the Government may effectively drive certain ideas or viewpoints
from the marketplace,&quot; Simon &amp; Schuster, 502 U.S., at
----, 112 S.Ct., at 508; Leathers v. Medlock, 499 U.S. ----, ----,
111 S.Ct. 1438, 1444, 113 L.Ed.2d 494 (1991); FCC v. League of
Women Voters of California, 468 U.S. 364, 383-384, 104 S.Ct. 3106,
3119-3120, 82 L.Ed.2d 278 (1984); Consolidated Edison Co., 447
U.S., at 536, 100 S.Ct., at 2333; Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley,
408 U.S., at 95-98, 92 S.Ct., at 2289-2292. But content discrimination
among various instances of a class of proscribable speech often
does not pose this threat.
<P>
When the basis for the content discrimination consists entirely
of the very reason the entire class of speech at issue is proscribable,
no significant danger of idea or viewpoint discrimination exists.
Such a reason, having been adjudged neutral enough to support
exclusion of the entire class of speech from First Amendment protection,
is also neutral enough to form the *2546 basis of distinction
within the class. To illustrate: A State might choose to prohibit
only that obscenity which is the most patently offensive in its
prurience--i.e., that which involves the most lascivious displays
of sexual activity. But it may not prohibit, for example, only
that obscenity which includes offensive political messages. See
Kucharek v. Hanaway, 902 F.2d 513, 517 (CA7 1990), cert. denied,
498 U.S. ----, 111 S.Ct. 713, 112 L.Ed.2d 702 (1991). And the
Federal Government can criminalize only those threats of violence
that are directed against the President, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 871--since
the reasons why threats of violence are outside the First Amendment
(protecting individuals from the fear of violence, from the disruption
that fear engenders, and from the possibility that the threatened
violence will occur) have special force when applied to the person
of the President. See Watts v. United States, 394 U.S. 705, 707,
89 S.Ct. 1399, 1401, 22 L.Ed.2d 664 (1969) (upholding the facial
validity of Sec. 871 because of the &quot;overwhelmin[g] interest
in protecting the safety of [the] Chief Executive and in allowing
him to perform his duties without interference from threats of
physical violence&quot;). But the Federal Government may not criminalize
only those threats against the President that mention his policy
on aid to inner cities. And to take a final example (one mentioned
by Justice STEVENS, post, at 2563-2564), a State may choose to
regulate price advertising in one industry but not in others,
because the risk of fraud (one of the characteristics of commercial
speech that justifies depriving it of full First Amendment protection,
see Virginia Pharmacy Bd. v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council,
Inc., 425 U.S. 748, 771-772, 96 S.Ct. 1817, 1830-1831, 48 L.Ed.2d
346 (1976)) is in its view greater there. Cf. Morales v. Trans
World Airlines, Inc., 504 U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 2031, 119 L.Ed.2d
157 (1992) (state regulation of airline advertising); Ohralik
v. Ohio State Bar Assn., 436 U.S. 447, 98 S.Ct. 1912, 56 L.Ed.2d
444 (1978) (state regulation of lawyer advertising). But a State
may not prohibit only that commercial advertising that depicts
men in a demeaning fashion, see, e.g., L.A. Times, Aug. 8, 1989,
section 4, p. 6, col. 1.
<P>
Another valid basis for according differential treatment to even
a content-defined subclass of proscribable speech is that the
subclass happens to be associated with particular &quot;secondary
effects&quot; of the speech, so that the regulation is &quot;justified
without reference to the content of the ... speech,&quot; Renton
v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41, 48, 106 S.Ct. 925, 929,
89 L.Ed.2d 29 (1986) (quoting, with emphasis, Virginia Pharmacy
Bd., supra, 425 U.S., at 771, 96 S.Ct., at 1830); see also Young
v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., 427 U.S. 50, 71, n. 34, 96 S.Ct.
2440, 2453, n. 34, 49 L.Ed.2d 310 (1976) (plurality); id., at
80-82, 96 S.Ct., at 2457-2458 (Powell, J., concurring);
<P>
Barnes, 501 U.S., at ---- - ----, 111 S.Ct., at 2469-2471 (SOUTER,
J., concurring in judgment). A State could, for example, permit
all obscene live performances except those involving minors. Moreover,
since words can in some circumstances violate laws directed not
against speech but against conduct (a law against treason, for
example, is violated by telling the enemy the nation's defense
secrets), a particular content-based subcategory of a proscribable
class of speech can be swept up incidentally within the reach
of a statute directed at conduct rather than speech. See id.,
at ----, 111 S.Ct., at 2460 (plurality); id., at ---- - ----,
111 S.Ct., at 2465-2466 (SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment);
id., at ---- - ----, 111 S.Ct., at 2468-2469 (SOUTER, J., concurring
in judgment); FTC v. Superior Court Trial Lawyers Assn., 493 U.S.
411, 425-432, 110 S.Ct. 768, 776-780, 107 L.Ed.2d 851 (1990);
O'Brien, 391 U.S., at 376-377, 88 S.Ct., at 1678-1679. Thus, for
example, sexually derogatory &quot;fighting words,&quot; among
other words, may produce a violation of Title VII's general prohibition
against sexual discrimination in employment practices, 42 U.S.C.
Sec. 2000e-2; 29 CFR Sec. 1604.11 (1991). See also 18 U.S.C. Sec.
242; 42 U.S.C. Secs. 1981, 1982. Where the government does not
target conduct on the *2547 basis of its expressive content, acts
are not shielded from regulation merely because they express a
discriminatory idea or philosophy.
<P>
These bases for distinction refute the proposition that the selectivity
of the restriction is &quot;even arguably 'conditioned upon the
sovereign's agreement with what a speaker may intend to say.'
&quot; Metromedia, Inc. v. San Diego, 453 U.S. 490, 555, 101 S.Ct.
2882, 2917, 69 L.Ed.2d 800 (1981) (STEVENS, J., dissenting in
part) (citation omitted). There may be other such bases as well.
Indeed, to validate such selectivity (where totally proscribable
speech is at issue) it may not even be necessary to identify any
particular &quot;neutral&quot; basis, so long as the nature of
the content discrimination is such that there is no realistic
possibility that official suppression of ideas is afoot. (We cannot
think of any First Amendment interest that would stand in the
way of a State's prohibiting only those obscene motion pictures
with blue-eyed actresses.) Save for that limitation, the regulation
of &quot;fighting words,&quot; like the regulation of noisy speech,
may address some offensive instances and leave other, equally
offensive, instances alone. See Posadas de Puerto Rico, 478 U.S.,
at 342-343, 106 S.Ct., at 2977-2978. (FN6)
<P>
II
<P>
Applying these principles to the St. Paul ordinance, we conclude
that, even as narrowly construed by the Minnesota Supreme Court,
the ordinance is facially unconstitutional. Although the phrase
in the ordinance, &quot;arouses anger, alarm or resentment in
others,&quot; has been limited by the Minnesota Supreme Court's
construction to reach only those symbols or displays that amount
to &quot;fighting words,&quot; the remaining, unmodified terms
make clear that the ordinance applies only to &quot;fighting words&quot;
that insult, or provoke violence, &quot;on the basis of race,
color, creed, religion or gender.&quot; Displays containing abusive
invective, no matter how vicious or severe, are permissible unless
they are addressed to one of the specified disfavored topics.
Those who wish to use &quot;fighting words&quot; in connection
with other ideas--to express hostility, for example, on the basis
of political affiliation, union membership, or homosexuality--are
not covered. The First Amendment does not permit St. Paul to impose
special prohibitions on those speakers who express views on disfavored
subjects. See Simon &amp; Schuster, 502 U.S., at ---- - ----,
112 S.Ct., at ---- - ----; Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v.
Ragland, 481 U.S. 221, 229-230, 107 S.Ct. 1722, 1727-1728, 95
L.Ed.2d 209 (1987).
<P>
In its practical operation, moreover, the ordinance goes even
beyond mere content discrimination, to actual viewpoint discrimination.
Displays containing some words--odious racial epithets, for example--would
be prohibited to proponents of all views. But &quot;fighting words&quot;
that do not themselves invoke race, color, creed, religion, or
*2548 gender--aspersions upon a person's mother, for example--would
seemingly be usable ad libitum in the placards of those arguing
in favor of racial, color, etc. tolerance and equality, but could
not be used by that speaker's opponents. One could hold up a sign
saying, for example, that all &quot;anti-Catholic bigots&quot;
are misbegotten; but not that all &quot;papists&quot; are, for
that would insult and provoke violence &quot;on the basis of religion.&quot;
St. Paul has no such authority to license one side of a debate
to fight freestyle, while requiring the other to follow Marquis
of Queensbury Rules.
<P>
What we have here, it must be emphasized, is not a prohibition
of fighting words that are directed at certain persons or groups
(which would be facially valid if it met the requirements of the
Equal Protection Clause); but rather, a prohibition of fighting
words that contain (as the Minnesota Supreme Court repeatedly
emphasized) messages of &quot;bias-motivated&quot; hatred and
in particular, as applied to this case, messages &quot;based on
virulent notions of racial supremacy.&quot; 464 N.W.2d, at 508,
511. One must wholeheartedly agree with the Minnesota Supreme
Court that &quot;[i]t is the responsibility, even the obligation,
of diverse communities to confront such notions in whatever form
they appear,&quot; ibid., but the manner of that confrontation
cannot consist of selective limitations upon speech. St. Paul's
brief asserts that a general &quot;fighting words&quot; law would
not meet the city's needs because only a content-specific measure
can communicate to minority groups that the &quot;group hatred&quot;
aspect of such speech &quot;is not condoned by the majority.&quot;
Brief for Respondent 25. The point of the First Amendment is that
majority preferences must be expressed in some fashion other than
silencing speech on the basis of its content.
<P>
Despite the fact that the Minnesota Supreme Court and St. Paul
acknowledge that the ordinance is directed at expression of group
hatred, Justice STEVENS suggests that this &quot;fundamentally
misreads&quot; the ordinance. Post, at 2570. It is directed, he
claims, not to speech of a particular content, but to particular
&quot;injur[ies]&quot; that are &quot;qualitatively different&quot;
from other injuries. Post, at 2565. This is word-play. What makes
the anger, fear, sense of dishonor, etc. produced by violation
of this ordinance distinct from the anger, fear, sense of dishonor,
etc. produced by other fighting words is nothing other than the
fact that it is caused by a distinctive idea, conveyed by a distinctive
message. The First Amendment cannot be evaded that easily. It
is obvious that the symbols which will arouse &quot;anger, alarm
or resentment in others on the basis of race, color, creed, religion
or gender&quot; are those symbols that communicate a message of
hostility based on one of these characteristics. St. Paul concedes
in its brief that the ordinance applies only to &quot;racial,
religious, or gender-specific symbols&quot; such as &quot;a burning
cross, Nazi swastika or other instrumentality of like import.&quot;
Brief for Respondent 8. Indeed, St. Paul argued in the Juvenile
Court that &quot;[t]he burning of a cross does express a message
and it is, in fact, the content of that message which the St.
Paul Ordinance attempts to legislate.&quot; Memorandum from the
Ramsey County Attorney to the Honorable Charles A. Flinn, Jr.,
dated July 13, 1990, in In re Welfare of R.A.V., No. 89-D-1231
(Ramsey Cty. Juvenile Ct.), p. 1, reprinted in App. to Brief for
Petitioner C-1.
<P>
The content-based discrimination reflected in the St. Paul ordinance
comes within neither any of the specific exceptions to the First
Amendment prohibition we discussed earlier, nor within a more
general exception for content discrimination that does not threaten
censorship of ideas. It assuredly does not fall within the exception
for content discrimination based on the very reasons why the particular
class of speech at issue (here, fighting words) is proscribable.
As explained earlier, see supra, at 2545, the reason why fighting
words are categorically excluded from the protection of the First
Amendment is not that their content communicates *2549 any particular
idea, but that their content embodies a particularly intolerable
(and socially unnecessary) mode of expressing whatever idea the
speaker wishes to convey. St. Paul has not singled out an especially
offensive mode of expression--it has not, for example, selected
for prohibition only those fighting words that communicate ideas
in a threatening (as opposed to a merely obnoxious) manner. Rather,
it has proscribed fighting words of whatever manner that communicate
messages of racial, gender, or religious intolerance. Selectivity
of this sort creates the possibility that the city is seeking
to handicap the expression of particular ideas. That possibility
would alone be enough to render the ordinance presumptively invalid,
but St. Paul's comments and concessions in this case elevate the
possibility to a certainty.
<P>
St. Paul argues that the ordinance comes within another of the
specific exceptions we mentioned, the one that allows content
discrimination aimed only at the &quot;secondary effects&quot;
of the speech, see Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S.
41, 106 S.Ct. 925, 89 L.Ed.2d 29 (1986). According to St. Paul,
the ordinance is intended, &quot;not to impact on [sic ] the right
of free expression of the accused,&quot; but rather to &quot;protect
against the victimization of a person or persons who are particularly
vulnerable because of their membership in a group that historically
has been discriminated against.&quot; Brief for Respondent 28.
Even assuming that an ordinance that completely proscribes, rather
than merely regulates, a specified category of speech can ever
be considered to be directed only to the secondary effects of
such speech, it is clear that the St. Paul ordinance is not directed
to secondary effects within the meaning of Renton. As we said
in Boos v. Barry, 485 U.S. 312, 108 S.Ct.
<P>
1157, 99 L.Ed.2d 333 (1988), &quot;[l]isteners' reactions to speech
are not the type of 'secondary effects' we referred to in Renton.&quot;
Id., at 321, 108 S.Ct., at 1163-1164. &quot;The emotive impact
of speech on its audience is not a 'secondary effect.' &quot;
Ibid. See also id., at 334, 108 S.Ct., at 1170-1171. (opinion
of Brennan, J.). (FN7)
<P>
It hardly needs discussion that the ordinance does not fall within
some more general exception permitting all selectivity that for
any reason is beyond the suspicion of official suppression of
ideas. The statements of St. Paul in this very case afford ample
basis for, if not full confirmation of, that suspicion.
<P>
Finally, St. Paul and its amici defend the conclusion of the Minnesota
Supreme Court that, even if the ordinance regulates expression
based on hostility towards its protected ideological content,
this discrimination is nonetheless justified because it is narrowly
tailored to serve compelling state interests. Specifically, they
assert that the ordinance helps to ensure the basic human rights
of members of groups that have historically been subjected to
discrimination, including the right of such group members to live
in peace where they wish. We do not doubt that these interests
are compelling, and that the ordinance can be said to promote
them. But the &quot;danger of censorship&quot; presented by a
facially content-based statute, Leathers v. Medlock, 499 U.S.
----, ----, 111 S.Ct. 1438, 1444, 113 L.Ed.2d 494 (1991), requires
that that weapon be employed only where it is &quot;necessary
to serve the asserted [compelling] interest,&quot; Burson v. Freeman,
504 *2550 U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 1846, 1852, 119 L.Ed.2d 5
(1992) (plurality) (emphasis added); Perry Education Assn. v.
Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U.S. 37, 45, 103 S.Ct. 948,
954-955, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983). The existence of adequate content-neutral
alternatives thus &quot;undercut[s] significantly&quot; any defense
of such a statute, Boos v. Barry, supra, 485 U.S., at 329, 108
S.Ct., at 1168, casting considerable doubt on the government's
protestations that &quot;the asserted justification is in fact
an accurate description of the purpose and effect of the law,&quot;
Burson, supra, 504 U.S., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1859 (KENNEDY,
J., concurring). See Boos, supra, 485 U.S., at 324-329, 108 S.Ct.,
at 1165-1168; cf. Minneapolis Star &amp; Tribune Co. v. Minnesota
Comm'r of Revenue, 460 U.S. 575, 586-587, 103 S.Ct. 1365, 1372-1373,
75 L.Ed.2d 295 (1983). The dispositive question in this case,
therefore, is whether content discrimination is reasonably necessary
to achieve St. Paul's compelling interests; it plainly is not.
An ordinance not limited to the favored topics, for example, would
have precisely the same beneficial effect. In fact the only interest
distinctively served by the content limitation is that of displaying
the city council's special hostility towards the particular biases
thus singled out. (FN8) That is precisely what the First Amendment
forbids. The politicians of St. Paul are entitled to express that
hostility--but not through the means of imposing unique limitations
upon speakers who (however benightedly) disagree.
<P>
* * *
<P>
Let there be no mistake about our belief that burning a cross
in someone's front yard is reprehensible. But St. Paul has sufficient
means at its disposal to prevent such behavior without adding
the First Amendment to the fire.
<P>
The judgment of the Minnesota Supreme Court is reversed, and the
case is remanded for proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
<P>
It is so ordered.
<P>
Justice WHITE, with whom Justice BLACKMUN and Justice O'CONNOR
join, and with whom Justice STEVENS joins except as to Part I(A),
concurring in the judgment.
<P>
I agree with the majority that the judgment of the Minnesota Supreme
Court should be reversed. However, our agreement ends there.
<P>
This case could easily be decided within the contours of established
First Amendment law by holding, as petitioner argues, that the
St. Paul ordinance is fatally overbroad because it criminalizes
not only unprotected expression but expression protected by the
First Amendment. See Part II, infra. Instead, &quot;find[ing]
it unnecessary&quot; to consider the questions upon which we granted
review, (FN1) ante, at 2542, the *2551 Court holds the ordinance
facially unconstitutional on a ground that was never presented
to the Minnesota Supreme Court, a ground that has not been briefed
by the parties before this Court, a ground that requires serious
departures from the teaching of prior cases and is inconsistent
with the plurality opinion in Burson v. Freeman, 504 U.S. ----,
112 S.Ct. 1846, 119 L.Ed.2d 5 (1992), which was joined by two
of the five Justices in the majority in the present case.
<P>
This Court ordinarily is not so eager to abandon its precedents.
Twice within the past month, the Court has declined to overturn
longstanding but controversial decisions on questions of constitutional
law. See Allied Signal, Inc. v. Director, Division of Taxation,
504 U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 2251, --- L.Ed.2d ---- (1992); Quill
Corp. v. North Dakota, 504 U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 1904, 119 L.Ed.2d
91 (1992). In each case, we had the benefit of full briefing on
the critical issue, so that the parties and amici had the opportunity
to apprise us of the impact of a change in the law. And in each
case, the Court declined to abandon its precedents, invoking the
principle of stare decisis. Allied Signal, Inc., supra, --- U.S.,
at ---- - ----, 112 S.Ct., at 2261;
<P>
Quill Corp., supra, --- U.S., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1915-1916.
<P>
But in the present case, the majority casts aside long-established
First Amendment doctrine without the benefit of briefing and adopts
an untried theory. This is hardly a judicious way of proceeding,
and the Court's reasoning in reaching its result is transparently
wrong.
<P>
I
<P>
A
<P>
This Court's decisions have plainly stated that expression falling
within certain limited categories so lacks the values the First
Amendment was designed to protect that the Constitution affords
no protection to that expression. Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire,
315 U.S. 568, 62 S.Ct. 766, 86 L.Ed. 1031 (1942), made the point
in the clearest possible terms:
<P>
&quot;There are certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes
of speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been
thought to raise
<P>
any Constitutional problem.... It has been well observed that
such utterances are no essential part of any exposition of ideas,
and are of such slight social value as a step to truth that any
benefit that may be *2552 derived from them is clearly outweighed
by the social interest in order and morality.&quot; Id., at 571-572,
62 S.Ct., at 769.
<P>
See also Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc.,
466 U.S. 485, 504, 104 S.Ct. 1949, 1961, 80 L.Ed.2d 502 (1984)
(citing Chaplinsky ).
<P>
Thus, as the majority concedes, see ante, at 2543, this Court
has long held certain discrete categories of expression to be
proscribable on the basis of their content. For instance, the
Court has held that the individual who falsely shouts &quot;fire&quot;
in a crowded theatre may not claim the protection of the First
Amendment. Schenck v. United States, 249 U.S. 47, 52, 39 S.Ct.
247, 249, 63 L.Ed. 470 (1919). The Court has concluded that neither
child pornography, nor obscenity, is protected by the First Amendment.
New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 764, 102 S.Ct. 3348, 3358, 73
L.Ed.2d 1113 (1982); Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 20, 93
S.Ct. 2607, 2612, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973); Roth v. United States,
354 U.S. 476, 484-485, 77 S.Ct. 1304, 1308-1309, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498
(1957). And the Court has observed that, &quot;[l]eaving aside
the special considerations when public officials [and public figures]
are the target, a libelous publication is not protected by the
Constitution.&quot; Ferber, supra, 458 U.S., at 763, 102 S.Ct.,
at 3358 (citations omitted).
<P>
All of these categories are content based. But the Court has held
that First mendment does not apply to them because their expressive
content is worthless or of de minimis value to society. Chaplinsky,
supra, 315 U.S., at 571-572, 62 S.Ct., at 768-769. We have not
departed from this principle, emphasizing repeatedly that, &quot;within
the confines of [these] given classification[s], the evil to be
restricted so overwhelmingly outweighs the expressive interests,
if any, at stake, that no process of case-by-case adjudication
is required.&quot;
<P>
Ferber, supra, 458 U.S., at 763-764, 102 S.Ct., at 3358-3359;
Bigelow v. Virginia, 421 U.S. 809, 819, 95 S.Ct. 2222, 2231, 44
L.Ed.2d 600 (1975). This categorical approach has provided a principled
and narrowly focused means for distinguishing between expression
that the government may regulate freely and that which it may
regulate on the basis of content only upon a showing of compelling
need. (FN2)
<P>
Today, however, the Court announces that earlier Courts did not
mean their repeated statements that certain categories of expression
are &quot;not within the area of constitutionally protected speech.&quot;
Roth, supra, 354 U.S., at 483, 77 S.Ct., at 1308. See ante, at
2543, citing Beauharnais v. Illinois, 343 U.S. 250, 266, 72 S.Ct.
725, 735, 96 L.Ed. 919 (1952); Chaplinsky, supra, 315 U.S., at
571-572, 62 S.Ct., at 768-769; Bose Corp., supra, 466 U.S., at

The present Court submits that such clear statements &quot;must
be taken in context&quot; and are not &quot;literally true.&quot;
Ante, at 2543.
<P>
To the contrary, those statements meant precisely what they said:
The categorical approach is a firmly entrenched part of our First
Amendment jurisprudence. Indeed, the Court in Roth reviewed the
guarantees of freedom of expression in effect at the time of the
ratification of the Constitution and concluded, &quot;[i]n light
of this history, it is apparent that the unconditional phrasing
of the First Amendment was not intended to protect every utterance.&quot;
354 U.S., at 482-483, 77 S.Ct., at 1308.
<P>
In its decision today, the Court points to &quot;[n]othing ...
in this Court's precedents warrant[ing] disregard of this longstanding
tradition.&quot; Burson, 504 U.S., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1860
(SCALIA, J., concurring in judgment); Allied Signal, Inc., supra,
*2553 U.S., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 2261. Nevertheless, the majority
holds that the First Amendment protects those narrow categories
of expression long held to be undeserving of First Amendment protection--at
least to the extent that lawmakers may not regulate some fighting
words more strictly than others because of their content. The
Court announces that such content-based distinctions violate the
First Amendment because &quot;the government may not regulate
use based on hostility--or favoritism--towards the underlying
message expressed.&quot; Ante, at 2545. Should the government
want to criminalize certain fighting words, the Court now requires
it to criminalize all fighting words.
<P>
To borrow a phrase, &quot;Such a simplistic, all-or-nothing-at-all
approach to First Amendment protection is at odds with common
sense and with our jurisprudence as well.&quot; Ante, at 2543.
It is inconsistent to hold that the government may proscribe an
entire category of speech because the content of that speech is
evil, Ferber, supra, 458 U.S., at 763-764, 102 S.Ct., at 3358-3359;
but that the government may not treat a subset of that category
differently without violating the First Amendment; the content
of the subset is by definition worthless and undeserving of constitutional
protection.
<P>
The majority's observation that fighting words are &quot;quite
expressive indeed,&quot; ante, at 2544, is no answer. Fighting
words are not a means of exchanging views, rallying supporters,
or registering a protest; they are directed against individuals
to provoke violence or to inflict injury. Chaplinsky, 315 U.S.,
at 572, 62 S.Ct., at 769. Therefore, a ban on all fighting words
or on a subset of the fighting words category would restrict only
the social evil of hate speech, without creating the danger of
driving viewpoints from the marketplace. See ante, at 2545.
<P>
Therefore, the Court's insistence on inventing its brand of First
Amendment underinclusiveness puzzles me. (FN3) The overbreadth
doctrine has the redeeming virtue of attempting to avoid the chilling
of protected expression, Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601,
612, 93 S.Ct. 2908, 2915, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973); Osborne v. Ohio,
495 U.S. 103, 112, n. 8, 110 S.Ct. 1691, 1697, n. 8, 109 L.Ed.2d
98 (1990); Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U.S. 491, 503,
105 S.Ct. 2794, 2801, 86 L.Ed.2d 394 (1985); Ferber, supra, 458
U.S., at 772, 102 S.Ct., at 3362, but the Court's new &quot;underbreadth&quot;
creation serves no desirable function. Instead, it permits, indeed
invites, the continuation of expressive conduct that in this case
is evil and worthless in First Amendment terms, see Ferber, supra,
at 763-764, 102 S.Ct., at 3358-3359; Chaplinsky, supra, 315 U.S.,
at 571-572, 62 S.Ct., at 768-769, until the city of St. Paul cures
the underbreadth by adding to its ordinance a catch-all phrase
such as &quot;and all other fighting words that may constitutionally
be subject to this ordinance.&quot;
<P>
Any contribution of this holding to First Amendment jurisprudence
is surely a negative one, since it necessarily signals that expressions
of violence, such as the message of intimidation and racial hatred
conveyed by burning a cross on someone's lawn, are of sufficient
value to outweigh the social interest in order and morality that
has traditionally placed such fighting words outside the First
Amendment. (FN4) Indeed, by characterizing fighting words as a
form of &quot;debate,&quot; ante, at 2548, the majority *2554
legitimates hate speech as a form of public discussion.
<P>
Furthermore, the Court obscures the line between speech that could
be regulated freely on the basis of content (i.e., the narrow
categories of expression falling outside the First Amendment)
and that which could be regulated on the basis of content only
upon a showing of a compelling state interest (i.e., all remaining
expression). By placing fighting words, which the Court has long
held to be valueless, on at least equal constitutional footing
with political discourse and other forms of speech that we have
deemed to have the greatest social value, the majority devalues
the latter category. See Burson v. Freeman, supra, --- at ----,
112 S.Ct., at 1849-1850; Eu v. San Francisco County Democratic
Central Comm., 489 U.S. 214, 222-223, 109 S.Ct. 1013, 1019-1020,
103 L.Ed.2d 271 (1989).
<P>
B
<P>
In a second break with precedent, the Court refuses to sustain
the ordinance even though it would survive under the strict scrutiny
applicable to other protected expression. Assuming, arguendo,
that the St. Paul ordinance is a content-based regulation of protected
expression, it nevertheless would pass First Amendment review
under settled law upon a showing that the regulation &quot; 'is
necessary to serve a compelling state interest and is narrowly
drawn to achieve that end.' &quot; Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc.
v. New York Crime Victims Board, 502 U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct.
501, 509, 116 L.Ed.2d 476 (1991) (quoting Arkansas Writers' Project,
Inc., v. Ragland, 481 U.S. 221, 231, 107 S.Ct. 1722, 1728, 95
L.Ed.2d 209 (1987)). St. Paul has urged that its ordinance, in
the words of the majority, &quot;helps to ensure the basic human
rights of members of groups that have historically been subjected
to discrimination....&quot; Ante, at ----. The Court expressly
concedes that this interest is compelling and is promoted by the
ordinance. Ibid. Nevertheless, the Court treats strict scrutiny
analysis as irrelevant to the constitutionality of the legislation:
<P>
&quot;The dispositive question ... is whether content discrimination
is reasonably necessary in order to achieve St. Paul's compelling
interests; it plainly is not. An ordinance not limited to the
favored topics would have precisely the same beneficial effect.&quot;
Ibid.
<P>
Under the majority's view, a narrowly drawn, content-based ordinance
could never pass constitutional muster if the object of that legislation
could be accomplished by banning a wider category of speech. This
appears to be a general renunciation of strict scrutiny review,
a fundamental tool of First Amendment analysis. (FN5)
<P>
This abandonment of the doctrine is inexplicable in light of our
decision in Burson v. Freeman, supra, which was handed down just
a month ago. (FN6) In Burson, seven *2555 of the eight participating
members of the Court agreed that the strict scrutiny standard
applied in a case involving a First Amendment challenge to a content-based
statute. See id., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1851; id., at ----, 112
S.Ct., at 1848 (STEVENS, J., dissenting). (FN7) The statute at
issue prohibited the solicitation of votes and the display or
distribution of campaign materials within 100 feet of the entrance
to a polling place. The plurality concluded that the legislation
survived strict scrutiny because the State had asserted a compelling
interest in regulating electioneering near polling places and
because the statute at issue was narrowly tailored to accomplish
that goal. Id., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1856-1857.
<P>
Significantly, the statute in Burson did not proscribe all speech
near polling places; it restricted only political speech. Id.,
at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1850. The Burson plurality, which included
THE CHIEF JUSTICE and Justice KENNEDY, concluded that the distinction
between types of speech required application of strict scrutiny,
but it squarely rejected the proposition that the legislation
failed First Amendment review because it could have been drafted
in broader, content-neutral terms:
<P>
&quot;States adopt laws to address the problems that confront
them.
<P>
The First Amendment does not require States to regulate for problems
that do not exist.&quot; Id., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1856 (emphasis
added).
<P>
This reasoning is in direct conflict with the majority's analysis
in the present case, which leaves two options to lawmakers attempting
to regulate expressions of violence: (1) enact a sweeping prohibition
on an entire class of speech (thereby requiring &quot;regulat[ion]
for problems that do not exist); or (2) not legislate at all.
<P>
Had the analysis adopted by the majority in the present case been
applied in Burson, the challenged election law would have failed
constitutional review, for its content-based distinction between
political and nonpolitical speech could not have been characterized
as &quot;reasonably necessary,&quot; ante, at 2550, to achieve
the State's interest in regulating polling place premises. (FN8)
<P>
As with its rejection of the Court's categorical analysis, the
majority offers no reasoned basis for discarding our firmly established
strict scrutiny analysis at this time. The majority appears to
believe that its doctrinal revisionism is necessary to prevent
our elected lawmakers from prohibiting libel against members of
one political party but not another and from enacting similarly
preposterous laws. Ante, at 2543. The majority is misguided.
<P>
Although the First Amendment does not apply to categories of unprotected
speech, such as fighting words, the Equal Protection Clause requires
that the regulation of unprotected speech be rationally related
to a legitimate government interest. A defamation statute that
drew distinctions on the basis of political affiliation or &quot;an
ordinance prohibiting only those legally obscene works that contain
criticism of the *2556 city government,&quot; ante, at 2543, would
unquestionably fail rational basis review. (FN9)
<P>
Turning to the St. Paul ordinance and assuming arguendo, as the
majority does, that the ordinance is not constitutionally overbroad
(but see Part II, infra ), there is no question that it would
pass equal protection review. The ordinance proscribes a subset
of &quot;fighting words,&quot; those that injure &quot;on the
basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender.&quot; This selective
regulation reflects the City's judgment that harms based on race,
color, creed, religion, or gender are more pressing public concerns
than the harms caused by other fighting words. In light of our
Nation's long and painful experience with discrimination, this
determination is plainly reasonable. Indeed, as the majority concedes,
the interest is compelling. Ante, at 2549.
<P>
C
<P>
The Court has patched up its argument with an apparently nonexhaustive
list of ad hoc exceptions, in what can be viewed either as an
attempt to confine the effects of its decision to the facts of
this case, see post, at 2560-2561 (BLACKMUN, J., concurring in
judgment), or as an effort to anticipate some of the questions
that will arise from its radical revision of First Amendment law.
<P>
For instance, if the majority were to give general application
to the rule on which it decides this case, today's decision would
call into question the
<P>
constitutionality of the statute making it illegal to threaten
the life of the President. 18 U.S.C. Sec. 871. See Watts v. United
States, 394 U.S. 705, 89 S.Ct. 1399, 22 L.Ed.2d 664 (1969) (per
curiam ). Surely, this statute, by singling out certain threats,
incorporates a content-based distinction; it indicates that the
Government especially disfavors threats against the President
as opposed to threats against all others. (FN10) See ante, at
2547. But because the Government could prohibit all threats and
not just those directed against the President, under the Court's
theory, the compelling reasons justifying the enactment of special
legislation to safeguard the President would be irrelevant, and
the statute would fail First Amendment review.
<P>
To save the statute, the majority has engrafted the following
exception onto its newly announced First Amendment rule: Content-based
distinctions may be drawn within an unprotected category of speech
if the basis for the distinctions is &quot;the very reason the
entire class of speech at issue is proscribable.&quot; Ante, at
2545. Thus, the argument goes, the statute making it illegal to
threaten the life of the President is constitutional, &quot;since
the reasons why threats of violence are outside the First Amendment
(protecting individuals from the fear of violence, from the disruption
that fear engenders, and from the possibility that the threatened
violence will occur) have special force when applied to the person
of the President.&quot; Ante, at 2546.
<P>
The exception swallows the majority's rule. Certainly, it should
apply to the St. Paul ordinance, since &quot;the reasons why [fighting
words] are outside the First Amendment ... have special force
when applied to [groups that have historically been subjected
to discrimination].&quot;
<P>
To avoid the result of its own analysis, the Court suggests that
fighting words are *2557 simply a mode of communication, rather
than a content-based category, and that the St. Paul ordinance
has not singled out a particularly objectionable mode of communication.
Ante, at 2545, 2548. Again, the majority confuses the issue. A
prohibition on fighting words is not a time, place, or manner
restriction; it is a ban on a class of speech that conveys an
overriding message of personal injury and imminent violence, Chaplinsky,
supra, 315 U.S., at 572, 62 S.Ct., at 769, a message that is at
its ugliest when directed against groups that have long been the
targets of discrimination. Accordingly, the ordinance falls within
the first exception to the majority's theory.
<P>
As its second exception, the Court posits that certain content-based
regulations will survive under the new regime if the regulated
subclass &quot;happens to be associated with particular 'secondary
effects' of the speech ...,&quot; ante, at 2546, which the majority
treats as encompassing instances in which &quot;words can ...
violate laws directed not against speech but against conduct ...&quot;
Ante, at 2546. (FN11) Again, there is a simple explanation for
the Court's eagerness to craft an exception to its new First Amendment
rule:
<P>
Under the general rule the Court applies in this case, Title VII
hostile work environment claims would suddenly be unconstitutional.
<P>
Title VII makes it unlawful to discriminate &quot;because of [an]
individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin,&quot;
42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e-2(a)(1), and the regulations covering hostile
workplace claims forbid &quot;sexual harassment,&quot; which includes
&quot;[u]nwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors,
and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature&quot;
which creates &quot;an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working
environment.&quot; 29 CFR Sec.
<P>
1604.11(a) (1991). The regulation does not prohibit workplace
harassment generally; it focuses on what the majority would characterize
as the &quot;disfavored topi[c]&quot; of sexual harassment. Ante,
at 2547. In this way, Title VII is similar to the St. Paul ordinance
that the majority condemns because it &quot;impose[s] special
prohibitions on those speakers who express views on disfavored
subjects.&quot; Ibid. Under the broad principle the Court uses
to decide the present case, hostile work environment claims based
on sexual harassment should fail First Amendment review; because
a general ban on harassment in the workplace would cover the problem
of sexual harassment, any attempt to proscribe the subcategory
of sexually harassing expression would violate the First Amendment.
<P>
Hence, the majority's second exception, which the Court indicates
would insulate a Title VII hostile work environment claim from
an underinclusiveness challenge because &quot;sexually derogatory
'fighting words' ... may produce a violation of Title VII's general
prohibition against sexual discrimination in employment practices.&quot;
Ante, at 2546. But application of this exception to a hostile
work environment claim does not hold up under close examination.
<P>
First, the hostile work environment regulation is not keyed to
the presence or absence of an economic quid pro quo, Meritor Savings
Bank v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 65, 106 S.Ct. 2399, 2404, 91 L.Ed.2d
49 (1986), but to the impact of the speech on the victimized worker.
Consequently, the regulation would no more fall within a secondary
effects exception than does the St. Paul ordinance. Ante, at 2549.
Second, the majority's focus on the statute's general prohibition
on discrimination glosses over the language of the specific regulation
governing hostile working environment, which reaches beyond any
&quot;incidental&quot; effect on speech. United States v. O'Brien,
391 U.S. 367, 376, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 1678, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968).
If the relationship between *2558 the broader statute and specific
regulation is sufficient to bring the Title VII regulation within
O'Brien, then all St. Paul need do to bring its ordinance within
this exception is to add some prefatory language concerning discrimination
generally.
<P>
As the third exception to the Court's theory for deciding this
case, the majority concocts a catchall exclusion to protect against
unforeseen problems, a concern that is heightened here given the
lack of briefing on the majority's decisional theory. This final
exception would apply in cases in which &quot;there is no realistic
possibility that official suppression of ideas is afoot.&quot;
Ante, at 2547. As I have demonstrated, this case does not concern
the official suppression of ideas. See supra, at 2553. The majority
discards this notion out-of-hand. Ante, at 2549.
<P>
As I see it, the Court's theory does not work and will do nothing
more than confuse the law. Its selection of this case to rewrite
First Amendment law is particularly inexplicable, because the
whole problem could have been avoided by deciding this case under
settled First Amendment principles.
<P>
II
<P>
Although I disagree with the Court's analysis, I do agree with
its conclusion: The St. Paul ordinance is unconstitutional. However,
I would decide the case on overbreadth grounds.
<P>
We have emphasized time and again that overbreadth doctrine is
an exception to the established principle that &quot;a person
to whom a statute may constitutionally be applied will not be
heard to challenge that statute on the ground that it may conceivably
be applied unconstitutionally to others, in other situations not
before the Court.&quot; Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S., at 610,
93 S.Ct., at 2915; Brockett v. Spokane Arcades, Inc., 472 U.S.,
at 503-504, 105 S.Ct., at 2801-2802. A defendant being prosecuted
for speech or expressive conduct may challenge the law on its
face if it reaches protected expression, even when that person's
activities are not protected by the First Amendment. This is because
&quot;the possible harm to society in permitting some unprotected
speech to go unpunished is outweighed by the possibility that
protected speech of others may be muted.&quot; Broadrick, supra,
413 U.S., at 612, 93 S.Ct., at 2916; Osborne v. Ohio, 495 U.S.,
at 112, n. 8, 110 S.Ct., at 169, n. 8; New York v. Ferber, supra,
458 U.S., at 768-769, 102 S.Ct. at 3360-3361;
<P>
Schaumburg v. Citizens for a Better Environment, 444 U.S. 620,
634, 100 S.Ct. 826, 834, 63 L.Ed.2d 73 (1980); Gooding v. Wilson,
405 U.S. 518, 521, 92 S.Ct. 1103, 1105, 31 L.Ed.2d 408 (1972).
<P>
However, we have consistently held that, because overbreadth analysis
is &quot;strong medicine,&quot; it may be invoked to strike an
entire statute only when the overbreadth of the statute is not
only &quot;real, but substantial as well, judged in relation to
the statute's plainly legitimate sweep,&quot; Broadrick, 413 U.S.,
at 615, 93 S.Ct., at 2917, and when the statute is not susceptible
to limitation or partial invalidation. Id., at 613, 93 S.Ct.,
at 2916; Board of Airport Comm'rs of Los Angeles v. Jews for Jesus,
Inc., 482 U.S. 569, 574, 107 S.Ct. 2568, 2571, 96 L.Ed.2d 500
(1987). &quot;When a federal court is dealing with a federal statute
challenged as overbroad, it should ... construe the statute to
avoid constitutional problems, if the statute is subject to a
limiting construction.&quot; Ferber, 458 U.S., at 769, n. 24,
102 S.Ct., at 3361, n. 24. Of course, &quot;[a] state court is
also free to deal with a state statute in the same way.&quot;
Ibid. See, e.g., Osborne, 495 U.S. at 113-114, 110 S.Ct., at 1698-1699.
<P>
Petitioner contends that the St. Paul ordinance is not susceptible
to a narrowing construction and that the ordinance therefore should
be considered as written, and not as construed by the Minnesota
Supreme Court. Petitioner is wrong. Where a state court has interpreted
a provision of state law, we cannot ignore that interpretation,
*2559 even if it is not one that we would have reached if we were
construing the statute in the first instance. Ibid.;
<P>
Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 355, 103 S.Ct. 1855, 1856, 75
L.Ed.2d 903 (1983); Hoffman Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates,
Inc., 455 U.S. 489, 494, n. 5, 102 S.Ct. 1186, 1191, n. 5, 71
L.Ed.2d 362 (1982). (FN12)
<P>
Of course, the mere presence of a state court interpretation does
not insulate a statute from overbreadth review. We have stricken
legislation when the construction supplied by the state court
failed to cure the overbreadth problem. See, e.g., Lewis v. City
of New Orleans, 415 U.S. 130, 132-133, 94 S.Ct. 970, 972, 39 L.Ed.2d
214 (1974); Gooding, supra, 405 U.S., at 524-525, 92 S.Ct., at
1107-1108. But in such cases, we have looked to the statute as
construed in determining whether it contravened the First Amendment.
Here, the Minnesota Supreme Court has provided an authoritative
construction of the St. Paul antibias ordinance. Consideration
of petitioner's overbreadth claim must be based on that interpretation.
<P>
I agree with petitioner that the ordinance is invalid on its face.
Although the ordinance as construed reaches categories of speech
that are constitutionally unprotected, it also criminalizes a
substantial amount of expression that--however repugnant--is shielded
by the First Amendment.
<P>
In attempting to narrow the scope of the St. Paul antibias ordinance,
the Minnesota Supreme Court relied upon two of the categories
of speech and expressive conduct that fall outside the First Amendment's
protective sphere: words that incite &quot;imminent lawless action,&quot;
Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395 U.S. 444, 449, 89 S.Ct. 1827, 1830, 23
L.Ed.2d 430 (1969), and &quot;fighting&quot; words, Chaplinsky
v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S., at 571-572, 62 S.Ct., at 768-769.
The Minnesota Supreme Court erred in its application of the Chaplinsky
fighting words test and consequently interpreted the St. Paul
ordinance in a fashion that rendered the ordinance facially overbroad.
<P>
In construing the St. Paul ordinance, the Minnesota Supreme Court
drew upon the definition of fighting words that appears in Chaplinsky--words
&quot;which by their very utterance inflict injury or tend to
incite an immediate breach of the peace.&quot; Id., at 572, 62
S.Ct., at 769. However, the Minnesota court was far from clear
in identifying the &quot;injur[ies]&quot; inflicted by the expression
that St. Paul sought to regulate. Indeed, the Minnesota court
emphasized (tracking the language of the ordinance) that &quot;the
ordinance censors only those displays that one knows or should
know will create anger, alarm or resentment based on racial, ethnic,
gender or religious bias.&quot; In re Welfare of R.A.V., 464 N.W.2d
507, 510 (1991). I therefore understand the court to have ruled
that St. Paul may constitutionally prohibit expression that &quot;by
its very utterance&quot; causes &quot;anger, alarm or resentment.&quot;
<P>
Our fighting words cases have made clear, however, that such generalized
reactions are not sufficient to strip expression of its constitutional
protection. The mere fact that expressive activity causes hurt
feelings, offense, or resentment does not render the expression
unprotected. See United States v. Eichman, 496 U.S. 310, 319,
110 S.Ct. 2404, 2410, 110 L.Ed.2d 287 (1990); Texas v. Johnson,
491 U.S. 397, *2560 409, 414, 109 S.Ct. 2533,
<P>
2541, 2544, 105 L.Ed.2d 342 (1989); Hustler Magazine, Inc. v.
Falwell, 485 U.S. 46, 55-56, 108 S.Ct. 876, 881-882, 99 L.Ed.2d
41 (1988); FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726, 745, 98 S.Ct.

Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U.S. 1, 69 S.Ct. 894, 93 L.Ed. 1131
(1949).
<P>
In the First Amendment context, &quot;[c]riminal statutes must
be scrutinized with particular care; those that make unlawful
a substantial amount of constitutionally protected conduct may
be held facially invalid even if they also have legitimate application.&quot;
Houston v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451, 459, 107 S.Ct. 2502, 2508, 96 L.Ed.2d
398 (1987) (citation omitted). The St. Paul antibias ordinance
is such a law. Although the ordinance reaches conduct that is
unprotected, it also makes criminal expressive conduct that causes
only hurt feelings, offense, or resentment, and is protected by
the First Amendment. Cf. Lewis, supra, 415 U.S., at 132, 94 S.Ct.,
at 972. (FN13) The ordinance is therefore fatally overbroad and
invalid on its face.

<P>
Today, the Court has disregarded two established principles of
First Amendment law without providing a coherent replacement theory.
Its decision is an arid, doctrinaire interpretation, driven by
the frequently irresistible impulse of judges to tinker with the
First Amendment. The decision is mischievous at best and will
surely confuse the lower courts. I join the judgment, but not
the folly of the opinion.
<P>
Justice BLACKMUN, concurring in the judgment.
<P>
I regret what the Court has done in this case. The majority opinion
signals one of two possibilities: it will serve as precedent for
future cases, or it will not. Either result is disheartening.
<P>
In the first instance, by deciding that a State cannot regulate
speech that causes great harm unless it also regulates speech
that does not (setting law and logic on their heads), the Court
seems to abandon the categorical approach, and inevitably to relax
the level of scrutiny applicable to content-based laws. As Justice
WHITE points out, this weakens the traditional protections of
speech. If all expressive activity must be accorded the same protection,
that protection will be scant. The simple reality is that the
Court will never provide child pornography or cigarette advertising
the level of protection customarily granted political speech.
If we are forbidden from categorizing, as the Court has done here,
we shall reduce protection across the board. It is sad that in
its effort to reach a satisfying result in this case, the Court
is willing to weaken First Amendment protections.
<P>
In the second instance is the possibility that this case will
not significantly alter First Amendment jurisprudence, but, instead,
will be regarded as an aberration--a case where the Court manipulated
doctrine to strike down an ordinance whose premise it opposed,
namely, that racial threats and *2561 verbal assaults are of greater
harm than other fighting words. I fear that the Court has been
distracted from its proper mission by the temptation to decide
the issue over &quot;politically correct speech&quot; and &quot;cultural
diversity,&quot; neither of which is presented here. If this is
the meaning of today's opinion, it is perhaps even more regrettable.
<P>
I see no First Amendment values that are compromised by a law
that prohibits hoodlums from driving minorities out of their homes
by burning crosses on their lawns, but I see great harm in preventing
the people of Saint Paul from specifically punishing the race-based
fighting words that so prejudice their community.
<P>
I concur in the judgment, however, because I agree with Justice
WHITE that this particular ordinance reaches beyond fighting words
to speech protected by the First Amendment.
<P>
Justice STEVENS, with whom Justice WHITE and Justice BLACKMUN
join as to Part I, concurring in the judgment.
<P>
Conduct that creates special risks or causes special harms may
be prohibited by special rules. Lighting a fire near an ammunition
dump or a gasoline storage tank is especially dangerous; such
behavior may be punished more severely than burning trash in a
vacant lot. Threatening someone because of her race or religious
beliefs may cause particularly severe trauma or touch off a riot,
and threatening a high public official may cause substantial social
disruption; such threats may be punished more severely than threats
against someone based on, say, his support of a particular athletic
team. There are legitimate, reasonable, and neutral justifications
for such special rules.
<P>
This case involves the constitutionality of one such ordinance.
Because the regulated conduct has some communicative content--a
message of racial, religious or gender hostility--the ordinance
raises two quite different First Amendment questions. Is the ordinance
&quot;overbroad&quot; because it prohibits too much speech? If
not, is it &quot;underbroad&quot; because it does not prohibit
enough speech?
<P>
In answering these questions, my colleagues today wrestle with
two broad principles: first, that certain &quot;categories of
expression [including 'fighting words'] are 'not within the area
of constitutionally protected speech,' &quot; ante, at 2553 (WHITE,
J., concurring in judgment); and second, that &quot;[c]ontent-based
regulations [of expression] are presumptively invalid.&quot; Ante,
at 2542 (Opinion of the Court). Although in past opinions the
Court has repeated both of these maxims, it has--quite rightly--adhered
to neither with the absolutism suggested by my colleagues. Thus,
while I agree that the St. Paul ordinance is unconstitutionally
overbroad for the reasons stated in Part II of Justice WHITE's
opinion, I write separately to suggest how the allure of absolute
principles has skewed the analysis of both the majority and concurring
opinions.
<P>
I
<P>
Fifty years ago, the Court articulated a categorical approach
to First Amendment jurisprudence.
<P>
&quot;There are certain well-defined and narrowly limited classes
of speech, the prevention and punishment of which have never been
thought to raise any Constitutional problem.... It has been well
observed that such utterances are no essential part of any exposition
of ideas, and are of such slight social value as a step to truth
that any benefit that may be derived from them is clearly outweighed
by the social interest in order and morality.&quot; Chaplinsky
v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 571-572, 62 S.Ct. 766, 769, 86
L.Ed. 1031 (1942).
<P>
We have, as Justice WHITE observes, often described such categories
of expression as &quot;not within the area of constitutionally
protected speech.&quot; Roth v. United States, 354 U.S. 476, 483,
77 S.Ct. 1304, 1308, 1 L.Ed.2d 1498 (1957).
<P>
*2562 The Court today revises this categorical approach. It is
not, the Court rules, that certain &quot;categories&quot; of expression
are &quot;unprotected,&quot; but rather that certain &quot;elements&quot;
of expression are wholly &quot;proscribable.&quot; To the Court,
an expressive act, like a chemical compound, consists of more
than one element. Although the act may be regulated because it
contains a proscribable element, it may not be regulated on the
basis of another (nonproscribable) element it also contains. Thus,
obscene antigovernment speech may be regulated because it is obscene,
but not because it is antigovernment. Ante, at 2543. It is this
revision of the categorical approach that allows the Court to
assume that the St. Paul ordinance proscribes only fighting words,
while at the same time concluding that the ordinance is invalid
because it imposes a content-based regulation on expressive activity.
<P>
As an initial matter, the Court's revision of the categorical
approach seems to me something of an adventure in a doctrinal
wonderland, for the concept of &quot;obscene anti-government&quot;
speech is fantastical. The category of the obscene is very narrow;
to be obscene, expression must be found by the trier of fact to
&quot;appea[l] to the prurient interest, ... depic[t] or describ[e],
in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct, [and] taken as a
whole, lac[k] serious literary, artistic, political or scientific
value.&quot; Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 24, 93 S.Ct. 2607,
2614-2615, 37 L.Ed.2d 419 (1973) (emphasis added). &quot;Obscene
antigovernment&quot; speech, then, is a contradiction in terms:
If expression is antigovernment, it does not &quot;lac[k] serious
... political ... value&quot; and cannot be obscene.
<P>
The Court attempts to bolster its argument by likening its novel
analysis to that applied to restrictions on the time, place, or
manner of expression or on expressive conduct. It is true that
loud speech in favor of the Republican Party can be regulated
because it is loud, but not because it is pro-Republican; and
it is true that the public burning of the American flag can be
regulated because it involves public burning and not because it
involves the flag. But these analogies are inapposite. In each
of these examples, the two elements (e.g., loudness and pro-Republican
orientation) can coexist; in the case of &quot;obscene antigovernment&quot;
speech, however, the presence of one element (&quot;obscenity&quot;)
by definition means the absence of the other. To my mind, it is
unwise and unsound to craft a new doctrine based on such highly
speculative hypotheticals.
<P>
I am, however, even more troubled by the second step of the Court's
analysis--namely, its conclusion that the St. Paul ordinance is
an unconstitutional content-based regulation of speech. Drawing
on broadly worded dicta, the Court establishes a near-absolute
ban on content-based regulations of expression and holds that
the First Amendment prohibits the regulation of fighting words
by subject matter. Thus, while the Court rejects the &quot;all-or-nothing-at-all&quot;
nature of the categorical approach, ante, at 2543, it promptly
embraces an absolutism of its own: within a particular &quot;proscribable&quot;
category of expression, the Court holds, a government must either
proscribe all speech or no speech at all. (FN1) This aspect of
the Court's ruling fundamentally misunderstands the role and constitutional
status of content-based regulations *2563 on speech, conflicts
with the very nature of First Amendment jurisprudence, and disrupts
well-settled principles of First Amendment law.
<P>
Although the Court has, on occasion, declared that content-based
regulations of speech are &quot;never permitted,&quot; Police
Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 99, 92 S.Ct. 2286, 2292,
33 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972), such claims are overstated. Indeed, in
Mosley itself, the Court indicated that Chicago's selective proscription
of nonlabor picketing was not per se unconstitutional, but rather
could be upheld if the City demonstrated that nonlabor picketing
was &quot;clearly more disruptive than [labor] picketing.&quot;
Id., at 100, 92 S.Ct., at 2292. Contrary to the broad dicta in
Mosley and elsewhere, our decisions demonstrate that content-based
distinctions, far from being presumptively invalid, are an inevitable
and indispensable aspect of a coherent understanding of the First
Amendment.
<P>
This is true at every level of First Amendment law. In broadest
terms, our entire First Amendment jurisprudence creates a regime
based on the content of speech. The scope of the First Amendment
is determined by the content of expressive activity: Although
the First Amendment broadly protects &quot;speech,&quot; it does
not protect the right to &quot;fix prices, breach contracts, make
false warranties, place bets with bookies, threaten, [or] extort.&quot;
Schauer, Categories and the First Amendment: A Play in Three Acts,
34 Vand.L.Rev. 265, 270 (1981). Whether an agreement among competitors
is a violation of the Sherman Act or protected activity under
the Noerr-Pennington doctrine (FN2) hinges upon the content of
the agreement. Similarly, &quot;the line between permissible advocacy
and impermissible incitation to crime or violence depends, not
merely on the setting in which the speech occurs, but also on
exactly what the speaker had to say.&quot; Young v. American Mini
Theatres, Inc., 427 U.S. 50, 66, 96 S.Ct. 2440, 2450, 49 L.Ed.2d
310 (1976) (plurality opinion); see also Musser v. Utah, 333 U.S.
95, 100-103, 68 S.Ct. 397, 399-401, 92 L.Ed. 562 (1948) (Rutledge,
J., dissenting).
<P>
Likewise, whether speech falls within one of the categories of
&quot;unprotected&quot; or &quot;proscribable&quot; expression
is determined, in part, by its content. Whether a magazine is
obscene, a gesture a fighting word, or a photograph child pornography
is determined, in part, by its content. Even within categories
of protected expression, the First Amendment status of speech
is fixed by its content. New York Times Co. v. Sullivan, 376 U.S.
254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964), and Dun &amp; Bradstreet,
Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc., 472 U.S. 749, 105 S.Ct. 2939,
86 L.Ed.2d 593 (1985), establish that the level of protection
given to speech depends upon its subject matter: speech about
public officials or matters of public concern receives greater
protection than speech about other topics. It can, therefore,
scarcely be said that the regulation of expressive activity cannot
be predicated on its content: much of our First Amendment jurisprudence
is premised on the assumption that content makes a difference.
<P>
Consistent with this general premise, we have frequently upheld
content-based regulations of speech. For example, in Young v.
American Mini Theatres, the Court upheld zoning ordinances that
regulated movie theaters based on the content of the films shown.
In FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726, 98 S.Ct. 3026, 57
L.Ed.2d 1073 (1978) (plurality opinion), we upheld a restriction
on the broadcast of specific indecent words. In Lehman v. City
of Shaker Heights, 418 U.S. 298, 94 S.Ct. 2714, 41 L.Ed.2d 770
(1974) (plurality opinion), we upheld a city law that permitted
commercial advertising, but prohibited political advertising,
on city buses. In Broadrick v. Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 93 *2564
S.Ct. 2908, 37 L.Ed.2d 830 (1973), we upheld a state law that
restricted the speech of state employees, but only as concerned
partisan political matters. We have long recognized the power
of the Federal Trade Commission to regulate misleading advertising
and labeling, see, e.g., Jacob Siegel Co. v. FTC, 327 U.S. 608,
66 S.Ct. 758, 90 L.Ed. 888 (1946), and the National Labor Relations
Board's power to regulate an employer's election-related speech
on the basis of its content. See, e.g., NLRB v. Gissel Packing
Co., 395 U.S. 575, 616-618, 89 S.Ct. 1918, 1942-1943, 23 L.Ed.2d
547 (1969). It is also beyond question that the Government may
choose to limit advertisements for cigarettes, see 15 U.S.C. Secs.
1331-1340, (FN3) but not for cigars; choose to regulate airline
advertising, see Morales v. Trans World Airlines, 504 U.S. ----,
112 S.Ct. 2031, 119 L.Ed.2d 157 (1992), but not bus advertising;
or choose to monitor solicitation by lawyers, see Ohralik v. Ohio
State Bar Assn., 436 U.S. 447, 98 S.Ct. 1912, 56 L.Ed.2d 444 (1978),
but not by doctors.
<P>
All of these cases involved the selective regulation of speech
based on content--precisely the sort of regulation the Court invalidates
today. Such selective regulations are unavoidably content based,
but they are not, in my opinion, &quot;presumptively invalid.&quot;
As these many decisions and examples demonstrate, the prohibition
on content-based regulations is not nearly as total as the Mosley
dictum suggests.
<P>
Disregarding this vast body of case law, the Court today goes
beyond even the overstatement in Mosley and applies the prohibition
on content-based regulation to speech that the Court had until
today considered wholly &quot;unprotected&quot; by the First Amendment--namely,
fighting words. This new absolutism in the prohibition of content-based
regulations severely contorts the fabric of settled First Amendment
law.
<P>
Our First Amendment decisions have created a rough hierarchy in
the constitutional protection of speech. Core political speech
occupies the highest, most protected position; commercial speech
and nonobscene, sexually explicit speech are regarded as a sort
of second-class expression; obscenity and fighting words receive
the least protection of all. Assuming that the Court is correct
that this last class of speech is not wholly &quot;unprotected,&quot;
it certainly does not follow that fighting words and obscenity
receive the same sort of protection afforded core political speech.
Yet in ruling that proscribable speech cannot be regulated based
on subject matter, the Court does just that. (FN4) Perversely,
this gives fighting words greater protection than is afforded
commercial speech. If Congress can prohibit false advertising
directed at airline passengers without also prohibiting false
advertising directed at bus passengers and if a city can prohibit
political advertisements in its buses while allowing other advertisements,
it is ironic to hold that a city cannot regulate fighting words
based on &quot;race, color, creed, religion or gender&quot; while
leaving unregulated fighting words based on &quot;union membership
or homosexuality.&quot; Ante, at 2547. The Court today turns First
Amendment law on its head: Communication that was once entirely
unprotected (and that still can be wholly proscribed) is now entitled
to greater protection than commercial speech--and possibly greater
protection than core political *2565 speech. See Burson v. Freeman,
504 U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 1846, ----, 119 L.Ed.2d 5 (1992).
<P>
Perhaps because the Court recognizes these perversities, it quickly
offers some ad hoc limitations on its newly extended prohibition
on content-based regulations. First, the Court states that a content-based
regulation is valid &quot;[w]hen the content discrimination is
based upon the very reason the entire class of speech ... is proscribable.&quot;
In a pivotal passage, the Court writes &quot;the Federal Government
can criminalize only those physical threats that are directed
against the President, see 18 U.S.C. Sec. 871--since the reasons
why threats of violence are outside the First Amendment (protecting
individuals from the fear of violence, from the disruption that
fear engenders, and from the possibility that the threatened violence
will occur) have special force when applied to the ... President.&quot;
Ante, at 2546.
<P>
As I understand this opaque passage, Congress may choose from
the set of unprotected speech (all threats) to proscribe only
a subset (threats against the President) because those threats
are particularly likely to cause &quot;fear of violence,&quot;
&quot;disruption,&quot; and actual &quot;violence.&quot;
<P>
Precisely this same reasoning, however, compels the conclusion
that St. Paul's ordinance is constitutional. Just as Congress
may determine that threats against the President entail more severe
consequences than other threats, so St. Paul's City Council may
determine that threats based on the target's race, religion, or
gender cause more severe harm to both the target and to society
than other threats. This latter judgment--that harms caused by
racial, religious, and gender-based invective are qualitatively
different from that caused by other fighting words--seems to me
eminently reasonable and realistic.
<P>
Next, the Court recognizes that a State may regulate advertising
in one industry but not another because &quot;the risk of fraud
(one of the characteristics that justifies depriving [commercial
speech] of full First Amendment protection ...)&quot; in the regulated
industry is &quot;greater&quot; than in other industries. Ante,
at 2546. Again, the same reasoning demonstrates the constitutionality
of St. Paul's ordinance. &quot;[O]ne of the characteristics that
justifies&quot; the constitutional status of fighting words is
that such words &quot;by their very utterance inflict injury or
tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace.&quot; Chaplinsky,
315 U.S., at 572, 62 S.Ct., at 762. Certainly a legislature that
may determine that the risk of fraud is greater in the legal trade
than in the medical trade may determine that the risk of injury
or breach of peace created by race-based threats is greater than
that created by other threats.
<P>
Similarly, it is impossible to reconcile the Court's analysis
of the St. Paul ordinance with its recognition that &quot;a prohibition
of fighting words that are directed at certain persons or groups
... would be facially valid.&quot; Ante, at 2548 (emphasis deleted).
A selective proscription of unprotected expression designed to
protect &quot;certain persons or groups&quot; (for example, a
law proscribing threats directed at the elderly) would be constitutional
if it were based on a legitimate determination that the harm created
by the regulated expression differs from that created by the unregulated
expression (that is, if the elderly are more severely injured
by threats than are the nonelderly). Such selective protection
is no different from a law prohibiting minors (and only minors)
from obtaining obscene publications. See Ginsberg v. New York,
390 U.S. 629, 88 S.Ct. 1274, 20 L.Ed.2d 195 (1968). St. Paul has
determined--reasonably in my judgment--that fighting-word injuries
&quot;based on race, color, creed, religion or gender&quot; are
qualitatively different and more severe than fighting-word injuries
based on other characteristics. Whether the selective proscription
of proscribable speech is defined by the protected target (&quot;certain
persons or groups&quot;) or the basis of the harm (injuries &quot;based
on race, color, creed, religion or gender&quot;) makes no constitutional
difference: what matters is whether *2566 the legislature's selection
is based on a legitimate, neutral, and reasonable distinction.
<P>
In sum, the central premise of the Court's ruling--that &quot;[c]ontent-based
regulations are presumptively invalid&quot;--has simplistic appeal,
but lacks support in our First Amendment jurisprudence. To make
matters worse, the Court today extends this overstated claim to
reach categories of hitherto unprotected speech and, in doing
so, wreaks havoc in an area of settled law. Finally, although
the Court recognizes exceptions to its new principle, those exceptions
undermine its very conclusion that the St. Paul ordinance is unconstitutional.
Stated directly, the majority's position cannot withstand scrutiny.
<P>
II
<P>
Although I agree with much of Justice WHITE's analysis, I do not
join Part I-A of his opinion because I have reservations about
the &quot;categorical approach&quot; to the First Amendment. These
concerns, which I have noted on other occasions, see, e.g., New
York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 778, 102 S.Ct. 3348, 3365-3366,
73 L.Ed.2d 1113 (1982) (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment),
lead me to find Justice WHITE's response to the Court's analysis
unsatisfying.
<P>
Admittedly, the categorical approach to the First Amendment has
some appeal:
<P>
either expression is protected or it is not--the categories create
safe harbors for governments and speakers alike. But this approach
sacrifices subtlety for clarity and is, I am convinced, ultimately
unsound. As an initial matter, the concept of &quot;categories&quot;
fits poorly with the complex reality of expression. Few dividing
lines in First Amendment law are straight and unwavering, and
efforts at categorization inevitably give rise only to fuzzy boundaries.
Our definitions of &quot;obscenity,&quot; see, e.g., Marks v.
United States, 430 U.S. 188, 198, 97 S.Ct. 990, 996, 51 L.Ed.2d
260 (1977) (STEVENS, J., concurring in part and dissenting in
part), and &quot;public forum,&quot; see, e.g., United States
Postal Service v. Council of Greenburgh Civic Assns., 453 U.S.
114, 126-131, 101 S.Ct. 2676, 2683-2686, 69 L.Ed.2d 517 (1981);
id., at 136-140, 101 S.Ct., at 2688-2691 (Brennan, J., concurring
in judgment); id., at 147-151, 101 S.Ct., at 2694-2696 (Marshall,
J., dissenting); 152-154, 101 S.Ct. at 2696-2698 (STEVENS, J.,
dissenting) (all debating the definition of &quot;public forum&quot;),
illustrate this all too well. The quest for doctrinal certainty
through the definition of categories and subcategories is, in
my opinion, destined to fail.
<P>
Moreover, the categorical approach does not take seriously the
importance of context. The meaning of any expression and the legitimacy
of its regulation can only be determined in context. (FN5) Whether,
for example, a picture or a sentence is obscene cannot be judged
in the abstract, but rather only in the context of its setting,
its use, and its audience. Similarly, although legislatures may
freely regulate most nonobscene child pornography, such pornography
that is part of &quot;a serious work of art, a documentary on
behavioral problems, or a medical or psychiatric teaching device,&quot;
may be entitled to constitutional protection; the &quot;question
whether a specific act of communication is protected by the First
Amendment always requires some consideration of both its content
and its context.&quot; Ferber, 458 U.S. at 778, 102 S.Ct., at
3366 (STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment); see also Smith v.
<P>
United States, 431 U.S. 291, 311-321, 97 S.Ct. 1756, 1769-1774,
52 L.Ed.2d 324
<P>
(1977) (STEVENS, J., dissenting). The categorical approach sweeps
too broadly when it declares that all such expression *2567 is
beyond the protection of the First Amendment.
<P>
Perhaps sensing the limits of such an all-or-nothing approach,
the Court has applied its analysis less categorically than its
doctrinal statements suggest.
<P>
The Court has recognized intermediate categories of speech (for
example, for indecent nonobscene speech and commercial speech)
and geographic categories of speech (public fora, limited public
fora, nonpublic fora) entitled to varying levels of protection.
The Court has also stringently delimited the categories of unprotected
speech. While we once declared that &quot;[l]ibelous utterances
[are] not ... within the area of constitutionally protected speech,&quot;
Beauharnais v. Illinois, 343 U.S. 250, 266, 72 S.Ct. 725, 735,
96 L.Ed. 919 (1952), our rulings in New York Times Co. v. Sullivan,
376 U.S. 254, 84 S.Ct. 710, 11 L.Ed.2d 686 (1964); Gertz v. Robert
Welch, Inc., 418 U.S. 323, 94 S.Ct. 2997, 41 L.Ed.2d 789 (1974),
and Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc., 472
U.S. 749, 105 S.Ct. 2939, 86 L.Ed.2d 593 (1985), have substantially
qualified this broad claim. Similarly, we have consistently construed
the &quot;fighting words&quot; exception set forth in Chaplinsky
narrowly. See, e.g., Houston v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451, 107 S.Ct.
2502, 96 L.Ed.2d 398 (1987); Lewis v. City of New Orleans, 415
U.S. 130, 94 S.Ct. 970, 39 L.Ed.2d 214 (1974); Cohen v. California,
403 U.S. 15, 91 S.Ct. 1780, 29 L.Ed.2d 284 (1971). In the case
of commercial speech, our ruling that &quot;the Constitution imposes
no ... restraint on government [regulation] as respects purely
commercial advertising,&quot; Valentine v. Chrestensen, 316 U.S.
52, 54, 62 S.Ct. 920, 921, 86 L.Ed. 1262 (1942), was expressly
repudiated in Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer
Council, Inc., 425 U.S. 748, 96 S.Ct. 1817, 48 L.Ed.2d 346 (1976).
In short, the history of the categorical approach is largely the
history of narrowing the categories of unprotected speech.
<P>
This evolution, I believe, indicates that the categorical approach
is unworkable and the quest for absolute categories of &quot;protected&quot;
and &quot;unprotected&quot; speech ultimately futile. My analysis
of the faults and limits of this approach persuades me that the
categorical approach presented in Part I-A of Justice WHITE's
opinion is not an adequate response to the novel &quot;underbreadth&quot;
analysis the Court sets forth today.
<P>
III
<P>
As the foregoing suggests, I disagree with both the Court's and
part of Justice WHITE's analysis of the constitutionality St.
Paul ordinance. Unlike the Court, I do not believe that all content-based
regulations are equally infirm and presumptively invalid; unlike
Justice WHITE, I do not believe that fighting words are wholly
unprotected by the First Amendment. To the contrary, I believe
our decisions establish a more complex and subtle analysis, one
that considers the content and context of the regulated speech,
and the nature and scope of the restriction on speech. Applying
this analysis and assuming arguendo (as the Court does) that the
St. Paul ordinance is not overbroad, I conclude that such a selective,
subject-matter regulation on proscribable speech is constitutional.
<P>
Not all content-based regulations are alike; our decisions clearly
recognize that some content-based restrictions raise more constitutional
questions than others. Although the Court's analysis of content-based
regulations cannot be reduced to a simple formula, we have considered
a number of factors in determining the validity of such regulations.
<P>
First, as suggested above, the scope of protection provided expressive
activity depends in part upon its content and character. We have
long recognized that when government regulates political speech
or &quot;the expression of editorial opinion on matters of public
importance,&quot; FCC v. League of Women Voters of California,
468 U.S. 364, 375-376, 104 S.Ct. 3106, 3114-3115, 82 L.Ed.2d 278
(1984), &quot;First Amendment protectio[n] is 'at its zenith.'
&quot; Meyer v. *2568 Grant, 486 U.S. 414, 425, 108 S.Ct. 1886,
1894, 100 L.Ed.2d 425 (1988). In comparison, we have recognized
that &quot;commercial speech receives a limited form of First
Amendment protection,&quot; Posadas de Puerto Rico Associates
v. Tourism Co. of Puerto Rico, 478 U.S. 328, 340, 106 S.Ct. 2968,
2976, 92 L.Ed.2d 266 (1986), and that &quot;society's interest
in protecting [sexually explicit films] is of a wholly different,
and lesser magnitude than [its] interest in untrammeled political
debate.&quot; Young v. American Mini Theatres, 427 U.S., at 70,
96 S.Ct., at 2452; see also FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S.
726, 98 S.Ct. 3026, 57 L.Ed.2d 1073 (1978). The character of expressive
 activity also weighs in our consideration of its constitutional
status. As we have frequently noted, &quot;[t]he government generally
has a freer hand in restricting expressive conduct than it has
in restricting the written or spoken word.&quot; Texas v. Johnson,
491 U.S. 397, 406, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 2540, 105 L.Ed.2d 342 (1989);
see also United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 88 S.Ct. 1673,
20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968).
<P>
The protection afforded expression turns as well on the context
of the regulated speech. We have noted, for example, that &quot;[a]ny
assessment of the precise scope of employer expression, of course,
must be made in the context of its labor relations setting ...
[and] must take into account the economic dependence of the employees
on their employers.&quot; NLRB v. Gissel Packing Co., 395 U.S.,
at 617, 89 S.Ct., at 1942. Similarly, the distinctive character
of a university environment, see Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263,
277-280, 102 S.Ct. 269, 278-280, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981) (STEVENS,
J., concurring in judgment), or a secondary school environment,
see Hazelwood School Dist. v. Kuhlmeier, 484 U.S. 260, 108 S.Ct.
592, 98 L.Ed.2d 562 (1988), influences our First Amendment analysis.
The same is true of the presence of a &quot; 'captive audience[,
one] there as a matter of necessity, not of choice.' &quot; Lehman
v. City of Shaker Heights, 418 U.S., at 302, 94 S.Ct., at 2717
(citation omitted). (FN6) Perhaps the most familiar embodiment
of the relevance of context is our &quot;fora&quot; jurisprudence,
differentiating the levels of protection afforded speech in different
locations.
<P>
The nature of a contested restriction of speech also informs our
evaluation of its constitutionality. Thus, for example, &quot;[a]ny
system of prior restraints of expression comes to this Court bearing
a heavy presumption against its constitutional validity.&quot;
Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, 372 U.S. 58, 70, 83 S.Ct. 631,
639, 9 L.Ed.2d 584 (1963). More particularly to the matter of
content-based regulations, we have implicitly distinguished between
restrictions on expression based on subject matter and restrictions
based on viewpoint, indicating that the latter are particularly
pernicious. &quot;If there is a bedrock principle underlying the
First Amendment, it is that the Government may not prohibit the
expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea itself
offensive or disagreeable.&quot; Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S., at
414, 109 S.Ct., at 2544. &quot;Viewpoint discrimination is censorship
in its purest form,&quot; Perry Education Assn. v. Perry Local
Educators' Assn., 460 U.S. 37, 62, 103 S.Ct. 948, 964, 74 L.Ed.2d
794 (1983) (Brennan, J., dissenting), and requires particular
scrutiny, in part because such regulation often indicates a legislative
effort to skew public debate on an issue. See, e.g., Schacht v.
United States, 398 U.S. 58, 63, 90 S.Ct. 1555, 1559, 26 L.Ed.2d
44 (1970). &quot;Especially where ... the legislature's suppression
of speech suggests an attempt to give one side of a debatable
public question an advantage in expressing its views to the people,
the First Amendment is plainly offended.&quot; First National
Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 785-786, 98 S.Ct. 1407,
1420-1421, 55 L.Ed.2d 707 (1978). *2569 Thus, although a regulation
that on its face regulates speech by subject matter may in some
instances effectively suppress particular viewpoints, see, e.g.,
Consolidated Edison Co. of N.Y. v. Public Service Comm'n of N.Y.,
447 U.S. 530, 546-547, 100 S.Ct. 2326, 2338, 65 L.Ed.2d 319 (1980)
(STEVENS, J., concurring in judgment), in general, viewpoint-based
restrictions on expression require greater scrutiny than subject-matter
based restrictions. (FN7)
<P>
Finally, in considering the validity of content-based regulations
we have also looked more broadly at the scope of the restrictions.
For example, in Young v. American Mini Theatres, 427 U.S., at
71, 96 S.Ct., at 2452-2453, we found significant the fact that
&quot;what [was] ultimately at stake [was] nothing more than a
limitation on the place where adult films may be exhibited.&quot;
Similarly, in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, the Court emphasized
two dimensions of the limited scope of the FCC ruling. First,
the ruling concerned only broadcast material which presents particular
problems because it &quot;confronts the citizen ... in the privacy
of the home&quot;; second, the ruling was not a complete ban on
the use of selected offensive words, but rather merely a limitation
on the times such speech could be broadcast. 438 U.S., at 748-750,
98 S.Ct., at 3039-3041.
<P>
All of these factors play some role in our evaluation of content-based
<P>
regulations on expression. Such a multi-faceted analysis cannot
be conflated into two dimensions. Whatever the allure of absolute
doctrines, it is just too simple to declare expression &quot;protected&quot;
or &quot;unprotected&quot; or to proclaim a regulation &quot;content-based&quot;
or &quot;content-neutral.&quot;
<P>
In applying this analysis to the St. Paul ordinance, I assume
arguendo --as the Court does--that the ordinance regulates only
fighting words and therefore is not overbroad. Looking to the
content and character of the regulated activity, two things are
clear. First, by hypothesis the ordinance bars only low-value
speech, namely, fighting words. By definition such expression
constitutes &quot;no essential part of any exposition of ideas,
and [is] of such slight social value as a step to truth that any
benefit that may be derived from [it] is clearly outweighed by
the social interest in order and morality.&quot; Chaplinsky, 315
U.S., at 572, 62 S.Ct., at 769. Second, the ordinance regulates
&quot;expressive conduct [rather] than ... the written or spoken
word.&quot; Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S., at 406, 109 S.Ct., at
2540.
<P>
Looking to the context of the regulated activity, it is again
significant that the statute (by hypothesis) regulates only fighting
words. Whether words are fighting words is determined in part
by their context. Fighting words are not words that merely cause
offense; fighting words must be directed at individuals so as
to &quot;by their very utterance inflict injury.&quot; By hypothesis,
then, the St. Paul ordinance restricts speech in confrontational
and potentially violent situations. The case at hand is illustrative.
The cross-burning in this case--directed as it was to a single
African-American family trapped in their home--was nothing more
than a crude form of physical intimidation. That this cross-burning
sends a message of racial hostility does not automatically endow
it with complete constitutional protection. (FN8) *2570 Significantly,
the St. Paul ordinance regulates speech not on the basis of its
subject matter or the viewpoint expressed, but rather on the basis
of the harm the speech causes. In this regard, the Court fundamentally
misreads the St. Paul ordinance. The Court describes the St. Paul
ordinance as regulating expression &quot;addressed to one of [several]
specified disfavored topics,&quot; ante, at 2547 (emphasis supplied),
as policing &quot;disfavored subjects,&quot; ibid. (emphasis supplied),
and as &quot;prohibit[ing] ... speech solely on the basis of the
subjects the speech addresses.&quot; Ante, at 2542 (emphasis supplied).
Contrary to the Court's suggestion, the ordinance regulates only
a subcategory of expression that causes injuries based on &quot;race,
color, creed, religion or gender,&quot; not a subcategory that
involves discussions that concern those characteristics. (FN9)
The ordinance, as construed by the Court, criminalizes expression
that &quot;one knows ... [by its very utterance inflicts injury
on] others on the basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender.&quot;
In this regard, the ordinance resembles the child pornography
law at issue in Ferber, which in effect singled out child pornography
because those publications caused far greater harms than pornography
involving adults.
<P>
Moreover, even if the St. Paul ordinance did regulate fighting
words based on its subject matter, such a regulation would, in
my opinion, be constitutional. As noted above, subject-matter
based regulations on commercial speech are widespread and largely
unproblematic. As we have long recognized, subject-matter regulations
generally do not raise the same concerns of government censorship
and the distortion of public discourse presented by viewpoint
regulations. Thus, in upholding subject-matter regulations we
have carefully noted that viewpoint-based discrimination was not
implicated. See Young v. American Mini Theatres, 427 U.S., at
67, 96 S.Ct., at 2450-2451 (emphasizing &quot;the need for absolute
neutrality by the government,&quot; and observing that the contested
statute was not animated by &quot;hostility for the point of view&quot;
of the theatres); FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S., at 745-746,
98 S.Ct., at 3038-3039 (stressing that &quot;government must remain
neutral in the marketplace of ideas&quot;); see also FCC v. League
of Women's Voters of California, 468 U.S., at 412-417, 104 S.Ct.,
at 3134-3137 (STEVENS, J., dissenting); Metromedia, Inc. v. City
of San Diego, 453 U.S. 490, 554-555, 101 S.Ct. 2882, 2916-2917,
69 L.Ed.2d 800 (1981) (STEVENS, J., dissenting in part).
<P>
Indeed, some subject-matter restrictions are a functional necessity
in contemporary governance: &quot;The First Amendment does not
require States to regulate for problems that do not exist.&quot;
Burson v. Freeman, 504 U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 1846, 1856,
119 L.Ed.2d 5 (1992).
<P>
Contrary to the suggestion of the majority, the St. Paul ordinance
does not regulate expression based on viewpoint. The Court contends
that the ordinance requires proponents of racial intolerance to
&quot;follow the *2571. Marquis of Queensbury Rules&quot; while
allowing advocates of racial tolerance to &quot;fight freestyle.&quot;
The law does no such thing.
<P>
The Court writes:
<P>
&quot;One could hold up a sign saying, for example, that all 'anti-Catholic
bigots' are misbegotten; but not that all 'papists' are, for that
would insult and provoke violence 'on the basis of religion.'
&quot; Ante, at 2548.
<P>
This may be true, but it hardly proves the Court's point. The
Court's reasoning is asymmetrical. The response to a sign saying
that &quot;all [religious] bigots are misbegotten&quot; is a sign
saying that &quot;all advocates of religious tolerance are misbegotten.&quot;
Assuming such signs could be fighting words (which seems to me
extremely unlikely), neither sign would be banned by the ordinance
for the attacks were not &quot;based on ... religion&quot; but
rather on one's beliefs about tolerance. Conversely (and again
assuming such signs are fighting words), just as the ordinance
would prohibit a Muslim from hoisting a sign claiming that all
Catholics were misbegotten, so the ordinance would bar a Catholic
from hoisting a similar sign attacking Muslims.
<P>
The St. Paul ordinance is evenhanded. In a battle between advocates
of tolerance and advocates of intolerance, the ordinance does
not prevent either side from hurling fighting words at the other
on the basis of their conflicting ideas, but it does bar both
sides from hurling such words on the basis of the target's &quot;race,
color, creed, religion or gender.&quot; To extend the Court's
pugilistic metaphor, the St. Paul ordinance simply bans punches
&quot;below the belt&quot;--by either party. It does not, therefore,
favor one side of any debate. (FN10)
<P>
Finally, it is noteworthy that the St. Paul ordinance is, as construed
by the Court today, quite narrow. The St. Paul ordinance does
not ban all &quot;hate speech,&quot; nor does it ban, say, all
cross-burnings or all swastika displays. Rather it only bans a
subcategory of the already narrow category of fighting words.
Such a limited ordinance leaves open and protected a vast range
of expression on the subjects of racial, religious, and gender
equality. As construed by the Court today, the ordinance certainly
does not &quot; 'raise the specter that the Government may effectively
drive certain ideas or viewpoints from the marketplace.' &quot;
Ante, at 2545. Petitioner is free to burn a cross to announce
a rally or to express his views about racial supremacy, he may
do so on private property or public land, at day or at night,
so long as the burning is not so threatening and so directed at
an individual as to &quot;by its very [execution] inflict injury.&quot;
Such a limited proscription scarcely offends the First Amendment.
<P>
In sum, the St. Paul ordinance (as construed by the Court) regulates
expressive activity that is wholly proscribable and does so not
on the basis of viewpoint, but rather in recognition of the different
harms caused by such activity. Taken together, these several considerations
persuade me that the St. Paul ordinance is not an unconstitutional
content-based regulation of speech. Thus, were the ordinance not
overbroad, I would vote to uphold it.

<P>
FN3. Contrary to Justice WHITE's suggestion, post, at 2550-2551,
petitioner's claim is &quot;fairly included&quot; within the questions
presented in the petition for certiorari, see this Court's Rule
14.1(a). It was clear from the petition and from petitioner's
other filings in this Court (and in the courts below) that his
assertion that the St. Paul ordinance &quot;violat[es] overbreadth
... principles of the First Amendment,&quot; Pet. for Cert. i,
was not just a technical &quot;overbreadth&quot; claim--i.e.,
a claim that the ordinance violated the rights of too many third
parties--but included the contention that the ordinance was &quot;overbroad&quot;
in the sense of restricting more speech than the Constitution
permits, even in its application to him, because it is content-based.
An important component of petitioner's argument is, and has been
all along, that narrowly construing the ordinance to cover only
&quot;fighting words&quot; cannot cure this fundamental defect.
Id., at 12, 14, 15-16. In his briefs in this Court, petitioner
argued that a narrowing construction was ineffective because (1)
its boundaries were vague, Brief for Petitioner 26, and because
(2) denominating particular expression a &quot;fighting word&quot;
because of the impact of its ideological content upon the audience
is inconsistent with the First Amendment, Reply Brief for Petitioner
5; id., at 13 (&quot;[The ordinance] is overbroad, viewpoint discriminatory
and vague as 'narrowly construed' &quot;) (emphasis added). At
oral argument, counsel for Petitioner reiterated this second point:
&quot;It is ... one of my positions, that in [punishing only some
fighting words and not others], even though it is a subcategory,
technically, of unprotected conduct, [the ordinance] still is
picking out an opinion, a disfavored message, and making that
clear through the State.&quot; Tr. of Oral Arg. 8. In resting
our judgment upon this contention, we have not departed from our
criteria of what is &quot;fairly included&quot; within the petition.

*2571_ FN4. Justice WHITE concedes that a city council cannot
prohibit only those legally obscene works that contain criticism
of the city government, post, at 2555, but asserts that to be
the consequence, not of the First Amendment, but of the Equal
Protection Clause. Such content-based discrimination would not,
he asserts, &quot;be rationally related to a legitimate government
interest,&quot; ibid. But of course the only reason that government
interest is not a &quot;legitimate&quot; one is that it violates
the First Amendment. This Court itself has occasionally fused
the First Amendment into the Equal Protection Clause in this fashion,
but at least with the acknowledgment (which Justice WHITE cannot
afford to make) that the First Amendment underlies its analysis.
See Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 95, 92 S.Ct.
2286, 2289-2290, 33 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972) (ordinance prohibiting
only nonlabor picketing violated the Equal Protection Clause because
there was no &quot;appropriate governmental interest&quot; supporting
the distinction inasmuch as &quot;the First Amendment means that
government has no power to restrict expression because of its
message, its ideas, its subject matter, or its content&quot;);

<P>
Justice STEVENS seeks to avoid the point by dismissing the notion
of obscene anti-government speech as &quot;fantastical,&quot;
post, at 2562, apparently believing that any reference to politics
prevents a finding of obscenity. Unfortunately for the purveyors
of obscenity, that is obviously false. A shockingly hard core
pornographic movie that contains a model sporting a political
tattoo can be found, &quot;taken as a whole [to] lac[k] serious
literary, artistic, political, or scientific value,&quot; Miller
v. California, 413 U.S. 15, 24, 93 S.Ct. 2607, 2614-2615, 37 L.Ed.2d
419 (1973) (emphasis added). Anyway, it is easy enough to come
up with other illustrations of a content-based restriction upon
&quot;unprotected speech&quot; that is obviously invalid: the
anti-government libel illustration mentioned earlier, for one.
See supra, at 2543. And of course the concept of racist fighting
words is, unfortunately, anything but a &quot;highly speculative
hypothetica[l],&quot; post, at 2562.
<P>
FN5. Although Justice WHITE asserts that our analysis disregards
&quot;established principles of First Amendment law,&quot; post,
at 2560, he cites not a single case (and we are aware of none)
that even involved, much less considered and resolved, the issue
of content discrimination through regulation of &quot;unprotected&quot;
speech--though we plainly recognized that as an issue in Ferber.
It is of course contrary to all traditions of our jurisprudence
to consider the law on this point conclusively resolved by broad
language in cases where the issue was not presented or even envisioned.
<P>
FN6. Justice STEVENS cites a string of opinions as supporting
his assertion that &quot;selective regulation of speech based
on content&quot; is not presumptively invalid. Post, at 2563-2564.

with, three of them did not command a majority of the Court, Young
v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., 427 U.S. 50, 63-73, 96 S.Ct.
<P>
2440, 2448-2454, 49 L.Ed.2d 310 (1976) (plurality); FCC v. Pacifica

Siegel Co. v. FTC, 327 U.S. 608, 66 S.Ct. 758, 90 L.Ed. 888 (1946).
In any event, all that their contents establish is what we readily
concede: that presumptive invalidity does not mean invariable
invalidity, leaving room for such exceptions as reasonable and
viewpoint-neutral content-based discrimination in nonpublic forums,

*2571_ FN7. St. Paul has not argued in this case that the ordinance
merely regulates that subclass of fighting words which is most
likely to provoke a violent response. But even if one assumes
(as appears unlikely) that the categories selected may be so described,
that would not justify selective regulation under a &quot;secondary
effects&quot; theory. The only reason why such expressive conduct
would be especially correlated with violence is that it conveys
a particularly odious message; because the &quot;chain of causation&quot;
thus necessarily &quot;run[s] through the persuasive effect of
the expressive component&quot; of the conduct, Barnes v. Glen
Theatre, 501 U.S. ----, ----, 111 S.Ct. 2456, 2470-2471, 115 L.Ed.2d
504 (1991) (SOUTER, J., concurring in judgment), it is clear that
the St. Paul ordinance regulates on the basis of the &quot;primary&quot;
effect of the speech--i.e., its persuasive (or repellant) force.
<P>
FN8. A plurality of the Court reached a different conclusion with

earlier this Term in Burson v.
<P>
Freeman, 504 U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 1846, 119 L.Ed.2d 5 (1992).
In light of the &quot;logical connection&quot; between electioneering
and the State's compelling interest in preventing voter intimidation
and election fraud--an inherent connection borne out by a &quot;long
history&quot; and a &quot;wide-spread and time-tested consensus,&quot;
id., at ---- - ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1855-1858--the plurality concluded
that it was facd with one of those &quot;rare case[s]&quot; in
which the use of a facially content-based restriction was justified
by interests unrelated to the suppression of ideas, id., at ----,
112 S.Ct., at 1857-1858; see also id., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at
1859 (KENNEDY, J., concurring). Justice WHITE and Justice STEVENS
are therefore quite mistaken when they seek to convert the Burson
plurality's passing comment that &quot;[t]he First Amendment does
not require States to regulate for problems that do not exist,&quot;
id., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1856, into endorsement of the revolutionary
proposition that the suppression of particular ideas can be justified
when only those ideas have been a source of trouble in the past.

ordinance prohibiting the display of symbols, including a Nazi
swastika or a burning cross, on public or private property, which
one knows or has reason to know arouses anger, alarm, or resentment
in others on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, or gender
without violating overbreadth and vagueness principles of the
First Amendment to the United States Constitution?
<P>
&quot;2. Can the constitutionality of such a vague and substantially
overbroad content-based restraint of expression be saved by a
limiting construction, like that used to save the vague and overbroad
content-neutral laws, restricting its application to 'fighting
words' or 'imminent lawless action?' &quot; Pet. for Cert. i.
<P>
It has long been the rule of this Court that &quot;[o]nly the
questions set forth in the petition, or fairly included therein,
will be considered by the Court.&quot; This Court's Rule 14.1(a).
This Rule has served to focus the issues presented for review.
But the majority reads the Rule so expansively that any First
Amendment theory would appear to be &quot;fairly included&quot;
within the questions quoted above.
<P>
Contrary to the impression the majority attempts to create through
its selective quotation of petitioner's briefs, see ante, at 2542,
n. 3, petitioner did not present to this Court or the Minnesota
Supreme Court anything approximating the novel theory the majority
adopts today. Most certainly petitioner did not &quot;reiterat[e]&quot;
such a claim at argument; he responded to a question from the
bench. Tr. of Oral Arg. 8. Previously, this Court has shown the
restraint to refrain from deciding cases on the basis of its own
theories when they have not been pressed or passed upon by a state
court of last resort. See, e.g., Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213,
217-224, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 2321-2325, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983).
<P>
Given this threshold issue, it is my view that the Court lacks
jurisdiction to decide the case on the majority rationale. Cf.
Arkansas Elec. Cooperative Corp. v. Arkansas Public Serv. Comm'n,
461 U.S. 375, 382, n. 6, 103 S.Ct. 1905, 1911, n. 6, 76 L.Ed.2d
1 (1983). Certainly the preliminary jurisdictional and prudential
concerns are sufficiently weighty that we would never have granted
certiorari, had petitioner sought review of a question based on
the majority's decisional theory.
<P>
*2571_ FN2. &quot;In each of these areas, the limits of the unprotected
category, as well as the unprotected character of particular communications,
have been determined by the judicial evaluation of special facts
that have been deemed to have constitutional significance.&quot;
Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., 466 U.S.
485, 504-505, 104 S.Ct. 1949, 1961-1962, 80 L.Ed.2d 502 (1948).
<P>
FN3. The assortment of exceptions the Court attaches to its rule
belies the majority's claim, see ante, at 2545, that its new theory
is truly concerned with content discrimination. See Part I(C),
infra (discussing the exceptions).
<P>
FN4. This does not suggest, of course, that cross burning is always
unprotected. Burning a cross at a political rally would almost
certainly be protected expression. Cf. Brandenburg v. Ohio, 395
U.S. 444, 445, 89 S.Ct. 1827, 1828, 23 L.Ed.2d 430 (1969). But
in such a context, the cross burning could not be characterized
as a &quot;direct personal insult or an invitation to exchange
fisticuffs,&quot; Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 409, 109 S.Ct.
2533, 2542, 105 L.Ed.2d 342 (1989), to which the fighting words
doctrine, see Part II, infra, applies.
<P>
FN5. The majority relies on Boos v. Barry, 485 U.S. 312, 108 S.Ct.
1157, 99
<P>
L.Ed.2d 333 (1988), in arguing that the availability of content-neutral
alternatives &quot; 'undercut[s] significantly' &quot; a claim
that content-based
<P>
legislation is &quot; 'necessary to serve the asserted [compelling]
interest.' &quot; Ante, at 2549-2550 (quoting Boos, supra, at
329, 108 S.Ct., at 1168, and Burson v. Freeman, 504 U.S. ----,
----, 112 S.Ct. 1846, 1852, 119 L.Ed.2d 5 (plurality)). Boos does
not support the majority's analysis. In Boos, Congress already
had decided that the challenged legislation was not necessary,
and the Court pointedly deferred to this choice. 485 U.S., at
329, 108 S.Ct., at 1168. St. Paul lawmakers have made no such
legislative choice.
<P>
Moreover, in Boos, the Court held that the challenged statute
was not narrowly tailored because a less restrictive alternative
was available. Ibid. But the Court's analysis today turns Boos
inside-out by substituting the majority's policy judgment that
a more restrictive alternative could adequately serve the compelling
need identified by St. Paul lawmakers. The result would be: (a)
a statute that was not tailored to fit the need identified by
the government; and (b) a greater restriction on fighting words,
even though the Court clearly believes that fighting words have
protected expressive content. Ante, at 2544.
<P>
FN6. Earlier this Term, seven of the eight participating members
of the Court agreed that strict scrutiny analysis applied in Simon
&amp; Schuster, 502 U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 501, 116 L.Ed.2d 476
(1991), in which we struck down New York's &quot;Son of Sam&quot;
law, which required &quot;that an accused or convicted criminal's
income from works describing his crime be deposited in an escrow
account.&quot; Id., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 504.
<P>
FN7. The Burson dissenters did not complain that the plurality
erred in applying strict scrutiny; they objected that the plurality
was not sufficiently rigorous in its review. 504 U.S., at ----,
112 S.Ct., at 1865 (STEVENS, J., dissenting).
<P>
FN8. Justice SCALIA concurred in the judgment in Burson, reasoning
that the statute, &quot;though content-based, is constitutional
[as] a reasonable, viewpoint-neutral regulation of a nonpublic
forum.&quot; Id., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1848. However, nothing
in his reasoning in the present case suggests that a content-based
ban on fighting words would be constitutional were that ban limited
to nonpublic fora. Taken together, the two opinions suggest that,
in some settings, political speech, to which &quot;the First Amendment
'has its fullest and most urgent application,' &quot; is entitled
to less constitutional protection than fighting words. Eu v. San
Francisco County Democratic Central Comm., 489 U.S. 214, 223,
109 S.Ct. 1013, 1020, 103 L.Ed.2d 271 (1989) (quoting Monitor
Patriot Co. v. Roy, 401 U.S. 265, 272, 91 S.Ct. 621, 625, 28 L.Ed.2d
35 (1971)).
<P>
*2571_ FN9. The majority is mistaken in stating that a ban on
obscene works critical of government would fail equal protection
review only because the ban would violate the First Amendment.
Ante, at 2541, n. 2. While decisions such as Police Dept. of Chicago
v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 92 S.Ct. 2286, 33 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972),
recognize that First Amendment principles may be relevant to an
equal protection claim challenging distinctions that impact on
protected expression, id., at 95-99, 92 S.Ct., at 2289-2292, there
is no basis for linking First and Fourteenth Amendment analysis
in a case involving unprotected expression. Certainly, one need
not resort to First Amendment principles to conclude that the
sort of improbable legislation the majority hypothesizes is based
on senseless distinctions.
<P>
FN10. Indeed, such a law is content based in and of itself because
it distinguishes between threatening and nonthreatening speech.
<P>
FN11. The consequences of the majority's conflation of the rarely-used
secondary effects standard and the O'Brien test for conduct incorporating
&quot;speech&quot; and &quot;nonspeech&quot; elements, see generally
United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 376-377, 88 S.Ct. 1673,
1678-1679, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968), present another question that
I fear will haunt us and the lower courts in the aftermath of
the majority's opinion.
<P>
FN12. Petitioner can derive no support from our statement in Virginia
v. American Bookseller's Assn., 484 U.S. 383, 397, 108 S.Ct. 636,
645, 98 L.Ed.2d
<P>
782 (1988), that &quot;the statute must be 'readily susceptible'
to the limitation; we will not rewrite a state law to conform
it to constitutional requirements.&quot; In American Bookseller's,
no state court had construed the language in dispute. In that
instance, we certified a question to the state court so that it
would have an opportunity to provide a narrowing interpretation.
Ibid. In Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205, 216,
95 S.Ct. 2268, 2276, 45 L.Ed.2d 125 (1975), the other case upon
which petitioner principally relies, we observed not only that
the ordinance at issue was not &quot;by its plain terms ... easily
susceptible of a narrowing construction,&quot; but that the state
courts had made no effort to restrict the scope of the statute
when it was challenged on overbreadth grounds.
<P>
FN13. Although the First Amendment protects offensive speech,
Johnson v. Texas, 491 U.S., at 414, 109 S.Ct., at 2544, it does
not require us to be subjected to such expression at all times,
in all settings. We have held that such expression may be proscribed
when it intrudes upon a &quot;captive audience.&quot; Frisby v.
Schultz, 487 U.S. 474, 484-485, 108 S.Ct. 2495, 2502-2503, 101
L.Ed.2d 420 (1988); FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726,
748-749, 98 S.Ct. 3026, 3040-3041, 57 L.Ed.2d 1073 (1978). And
expression may be limited when it merges into conduct. United
States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672
(1968); cf. Meritor Savings Bank v. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 65, 106
S.Ct. 2399, 2404, 91 L.Ed.2d 49 (1986). However, because of the
manner in which the Minnesota Supreme Court construed the St.
Paul ordinance, those issues are not before us in this case.
<P>
FN1. The Court disputes this characterization because it has crafted
two exceptions, one for &quot;certain media or markets&quot; and
the other for content discrimination based upon &quot;the very
reason that the entire class of speech at issue is proscribable.&quot;
Ante, at 2545. These exceptions are, at best, ill-defined. The
Court does not tell us whether, with respect to the former, fighting
words such as cross-burning could be proscribed only in certain
neighborhoods where the threat of violence is particularly severe,
or whether, with respect to the second category, fighting words
that create a particular risk of harm (such as a race riot) would
be proscribable. The hypothetical and illusory category of these
two exceptions persuades me that either my description of the
Court's analysis is accurate or that the Court does not in fact
mean much of what it says in its opinion.
<P>
*2571_ FN2. See Mine Workers v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657, 85 S.Ct.
1585, 14 L.Ed.2d 626 (1965); Eastern Railroad Presidents Conference
v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127, 81 S.Ct. 523, 5 L.Ed.2d
464 (1961).
<P>
FN3. See also Packer Corp v. Utah, 285 U.S. 105, 52 S.Ct. 273,
76 L.Ed. 643 (1932) (Brandeis, J.) (upholding a statute that prohibited
the advertisement of cigarettes on billboards and street-car placards).
<P>
FN4. The Court states that the prohibition on content-based regulations
&quot;applies differently in the context of proscribable speech&quot;
than in the context of other speech, ante, at 2545, but its analysis
belies that claim. The Court strikes down the St. Paul ordinance
because it regulates fighting words based on subject matter, despite
the fact that, as demonstrated above, we have long upheld regulations
of commercial speech based on subject matter. The Court's self-description
is inapt: By prohibiting the regulation of fighting words based
on its subject matter, the Court provides the same protection
to fighting words as is currently provided to core political speech.
<P>
FN5. &quot;A word,&quot; as Justice Holmes has noted, &quot;is
not a crystal, transparent and unchanged, it is the skin of a
living thought and may vary greatly in color and content according
to the circumstances and the time in which it is used.&quot; Towne
v. Eisner, 245 U.S. 418, 425, 38 S.Ct. 158, 159, 62 L.Ed. 372
(1918); see also Jacobellis v. Ohio, 378 U.S. 184, 201, 84 S.Ct.
1676, 1685, 12 L.Ed.2d 793 (1964) (Warren, C.J., dissenting).
<P>
FN6. Cf. In re Chase, 468 F.2d 128, 139-140 (CA7 1972) (Stevens,
J., dissenting) (arguing that defendant who, for reasons of religious
belief, refused to rise and stand as the trial judge entered the
courtroom was not subject to contempt proceedings because he was
not present in the courtroom &quot;as a matter of choice&quot;).
<P>
FN7. Although the Court has sometimes suggested that subject-matter
based and viewpoint-based regulations are equally problematic,
see, e.g., Consolidated Edison Co. of N.Y. v. Public Service Comm'n
of N.Y., 447 U.S., at 537, 100 S.Ct., at 2338, our decisions belie
such claims.
<P>
FN8. The Court makes much of St. Paul's description of the ordinance
as regulating &quot;a message.&quot; Ante, at 2548. As always,
however, St. Paul's argument must be read in context:
<P>
&quot;Finally, we ask the Court to reflect on the 'content' of
the 'expressive conduct' represented by a 'burning cross.' It
is no less than the first step in an act of racial violence. It
was and unfortunately still is the equivalent of [the] waving
of a knife before the thrust, the pointing of a gun before it
is fired, the lighting of the match before the arson, the hanging
of the noose before the lynching. It is not a political statement,
or even a cowardly statement of hatred. It is the first step in
an act of assault. It can be no more protected than holding a
gun to a victim['s] head. It is perhaps the ultimate expression
of 'fighting words.' &quot; App. to Brief for Petitioner C-6.
<P>
FN9. The Court contends that this distinction is &quot;wordplay,&quot;
reasoning that &quot;[w]hat makes [the harms caused by race-based
threats] distinct from [the harms] produced by other fighting
words is ... the fact that [the former are] caused by a distinctive
idea.&quot; Ante, at 2548 (emphasis added). In this way, the Court
concludes that regulating speech based on the injury it causes
is no different from regulating speech based on its subject matter.
This analysis fundamentally miscomprehends the role of &quot;race,
color, creed, religion [and] gender&quot; in contemporary American
society. One need look no further than the recent social unrest
in the Nation's cities to see that race-based threats may cause
more harm to society and to individuals than other threats. Just
as the statute prohibiting threats against the President is justifiable
because of the place of the President in our social and political
order, so a statute prohibiting race-based threats is justifiable
because of the place of race in our social and political order.
Although it is regrettable that race occupies such a place and
is so incendiary an issue, until the Nation matures beyond that
condition, laws such as St. Paul's ordinance will remain reasonable
and justifiable.
<P>

(STEVENS, J., dissenting) (&quot;In this case ... the regulation
applies ... to a defined class of ... licensees [who] represent
heterogenous points of view. There is simply no sensible basis
for considering this regulation a viewpoint restriction--or ...
to condemn it as 'content-based'--because it applies equally to
station owners of all shades of opinion&quot;

Syllabus (FN*)
<P>
Pursuant to a Wisconsin statute, respondent Mitchell's sentence
for aggravated battery was enhanced because he intentionally selected
his victim on account of the victim's race. The State Court of
Appeals rejected his challenge to the law's constitutionality,
but the State Supreme Court reversed. Relying on R.A.V. v. St.
Paul, 505 U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 120 L.Ed.2d 305 it held that
the statute violates the First Amendment by punishing what the
legislature has deemed to be offensive thought and rejected the
State's contention that the law punishes only the conduct of intentional
victim selection. It also found that the statute was unconstitutionally
overbroad because the evidentiary use of a defendant's prior speech
would have a chilling effect on those who fear they may be prosecuted
for offenses subject to penalty enhancement. Finally, it distinguished
antidiscrimination laws, which have long been held constitutional,
on the ground that they prohibit objective acts of discrimination,
whereas the state statute punishes the subjective mental process.
<P>
Held: Mitchell's First Amendment rights were not violated by the
application of the penalty-enhancement provision in sentencing
him. Pp. 2198-2202.
<P>
(a) While Mitchell correctly notes that this Court is bound by
a state court's interpretation of a state statute, the State Supreme
Court did not construe the instant statute in the sense of defining
the meaning of a particular word or phrase. Rather, it characterized
the statute's practical effect for First Amendment purposes. Thus,
after resolving any ambiguities in the statute's meaning, this
Court may form its own judgment about the law's operative effect.
The State's argument that the statute punishes only conduct does
not dispose of Mitchell's claim, since the fact remains that the
same criminal conduct is more heavily punished if the victim is
selected *2196 because of his protected status than if no such
motive obtains. Pp. 2198-99.
<P>
(b) In determining what sentence to impose, sentencing judges
have traditionally considered a wide variety of factors in addition
to evidence bearing on guilt, including a defendant's motive for
committing the offense. While it is equally true that a sentencing
judge may not take into consideration a defendant's abstract beliefs,
however obnoxious to most people, the Constitution does not erect
a per se barrier to the admission of evidence concerning one's
beliefs and associations at sentencing simply because they are
protected by the First Amendment. Dawson v. Delaware, 503 U.S.
----, 112 S.Ct. 1093, 117 L.Ed.2d 309; Barclay v. Florida, 463
U.S. 939, 103 S.Ct. 3418, 77 L.Ed.2d 1134 (plurality opinion).
That Dawson and Barclay did not involve the application of a penalty-enhancement
provision does not make them inapposite. Barclay involved the
consideration of racial animus in determining whether to sentence
a defendant to death, the most severe &quot;enhancement&quot;
of all; and the state legislature has the primary responsibility
for fixing criminal penalties. Motive plays the same role under
the state statute as it does under federal and state antidiscrimination
laws, which have been upheld against constitutional challenge.
Nothing in R.A.V. v. St. Paul, supra, compels a different result
here. The ordinance at issue there was explicitly directed at
speech, while the one here is aimed at conduct unprotected by
the First Amendment. Moreover, the State's desire to redress what
it sees as the greater individual and societal harm inflicted
by bias-inspired conduct provides an adequate explanation for
the provision over and above mere disagreement with offenders'
beliefs or biases. Pp. 2199-2201.
<P>
(c) Because the statute has no &quot;chilling effect&quot; on
free speech, it is not unconstitutionally overbroad. The prospect
of a citizen suppressing his bigoted beliefs for fear that evidence
of those beliefs will be introduced against him at trial if he
commits a serious offense against person or property is too speculative
a hypothesis to support this claim. Moreover, the First Amendment
permits the admission of previous declarations or statements to
establish the elements of a crime or to prove motive or intent,
subject to evidentiary rules dealing with relevancy, reliability,
and the like. Haupt v. United States, 330 U.S. 631, 67 S.Ct. 874,
91 L.Ed. 1145. Pp. 2201-02.

<P>
Chief Justice REHNQUIST delivered the opinion of the Court.
<P>
Respondent Todd Mitchell's sentence for aggravated battery was
enhanced because he intentionally selected his victim on account
of the victim's race. The question presented in this case is whether
this penalty enhancement is prohibited by the First and Fourteenth
Amendments. We hold that it is not.
<P>
On the evening of October 7, 1989, a group of young black men
and boys, including Mitchell, gathered at an apartment complex
in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Several members of the group discussed
a scene from the motion picture &quot;Mississippi Burning,&quot;
in which a white man beat a young black boy who was praying. The
group moved outside and Mitchell asked them: &quot; 'Do you all
feel hyped up to move on some white people?' &quot; Brief for
Petitioner 4. Shortly thereafter, a young white boy approached
the group on the opposite side of the street where they were standing.
As the boy walked by, Mitchell said: &quot; 'You *2197 all want
to fuck somebody up? There goes a white boy; go get him.' &quot;
Id., at 4-5. Mitchell counted to three and pointed in the boy's
direction. The group ran towards the boy, beat him severely, and
stole his tennis shoes.
<P>
The boy was rendered unconscious and remained in a coma for four
days.
<P>
After a jury trial in the Circuit Court for Kenosha County, Mitchell
was convicted of aggravated battery. Wis.Stat. Secs. 939.05 and
940.19(1m) (1989-1990). That offense ordinarily carries a maximum
sentence of two years' imprisonment. Secs. 940.19(1m) and 939.50(3)(e).
But because the jury found that Mitchell had intentionally selected
his victim because of the boy's race, the maximum sentence for
Mitchell's offense was increased to seven years under Sec. 939.645.
That provision enhances the maximum penalty for an offense whenever
the defendant &quot;[i]ntentionally selects the person against
whom the crime ... is committed ... because of the race, religion,
color, disability, sexual orientation, national origin or ancestry
of that person....&quot; Sec. 939.645(1)(b). (FN1) The Circuit
Court sentenced Mitchell to four years' imprisonment for the aggravated
battery.
<P>
Mitchell unsuccessfully sought postconviction relief in the Circuit
Court. Then he appealed his conviction and sentence, challenging
the constitutionality of Wisconsin's penalty-enhancement provision
on First Amendment grounds. (FN2) The Wisconsin Court of Appeals
rejected Mitchell's challenge, 163 Wis.2d 652, 473 N.W.2d 1 (1991),
but the Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed. The Supreme Court held
that the statute &quot;violates the First Amendment directly by
punishing what the legislature has deemed to be offensive thought.&quot;169 Wis.2d 153, 163, 485 N.W.2d 807, 811 (1992). It rejected the
State's contention &quot;that the statute punishes only the 'conduct'
of intentional selection of a victim.&quot; Id., at 164, 485 N.W.2d,
at 812. According to the court, &quot;[t]he statute punishes the
'because of' aspect of the defendant's selection, the reason the
defendant selected the victim, the motive behind the selection.&quot;
Ibid. (emphasis in original). And under R.A.V. v. St. Paul, 505
U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 120 L.Ed.2d 305 (1992), &quot;the Wisconsin
legislature *2198 cannot criminalize bigoted thought with which
it disagrees.&quot; 169 Wis.2d, at 171, 485 N.W.2d, at 815.
<P>
The Supreme Court also held that the penalty-enhancement statute
was unconstitutionally overbroad. It reasoned that, in order to
prove that a defendant intentionally selected his victim because
of the victim's protected status, the State would often have to
introduce evidence of the defendant's prior speech, such as racial
epithets he may have uttered before the commission of the offense.
This evidentiary use of protected speech, the court thought, would
have a &quot;chilling effect&quot; on those who feared the possibility
of prosecution for offenses subject to penalty enhancement. See
id., at 174, 485 N.W.2d, at 816. Finally, the court distinguished
antidiscrimination laws, which have long been held constitutional,
on the ground that the Wisconsin statute punishes the &quot;subjective
mental process&quot; of selecting a victim because of his protected
status, whereas antidiscrimination laws prohibit &quot;objective
acts of discrimination.&quot; Id., at 176, 485 N.W.2d, at 817.
(FN3)
<P>
We granted certiorari because of the importance of the question
presented and the existence of a conflict of authority among state
high courts on the constitutionality of statutes similar to Wisconsin's
penalty-enhancement provision, (FN4) 506 U.S. ----, 113 S.Ct.
810, 121 L.Ed.2d 683 (1992). We reverse.
<P>
Mitchell argues that we are bound by the Wisconsin Supreme Court's
conclusion that the statute punishes bigoted thought and not conduct.
There is no doubt that we are bound by a state court's construction
of a state statute. R.A.V., supra, at ---- - ----, 112 S.Ct.,
at 2541-2542; New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 769, n. 24, 102
S.Ct. 3348, 3361, n. 24, 73 L.Ed.2d 1113 (1982);
<P>
Terminiello v. Chicago, 337 U.S. 1, 4, 69 S.Ct. 894, 895, 93 L.Ed.
1131 (1949). In Terminiello, for example, the Illinois courts
had defined the term &quot; 'breach of the peace,' &quot; in a
city ordinance prohibiting disorderly conduct, to include &quot;
'stirs the public to anger ... or creates a disturbance.' &quot;
Id., at 4, 69 S.Ct., at 895. We held this construction to be binding
on us. But here the Wisconsin Supreme Court did not, strictly
speaking, construe the Wisconsin statute in the sense of defining
the meaning of a particular statutory word or phrase. Rather,
it merely characterized the &quot;practical effect&quot; of the
statute for First Amendment purposes. See 169 *2199 Wis.2d, at
166-167, 485 N.W.2d, at 813 (&quot;Merely because the statute
refers in a literal sense to the intentional 'conduct' of selecting,
does not mean the court must turn a blind eye to the intent and
practical effect of the law--punishment of motive or thought&quot;).
This assessment does not bind us. Once any ambiguities as to the
meaning of the statute are resolved, we may form our own judgment
as to its operative effect.
<P>
The State argues that the statute does not punish bigoted thought,
as the Supreme Court of Wisconsin said, but instead punishes only
conduct. While this argument is literally correct, it does not
dispose of Mitchell's First Amendment challenge. To be sure, our
cases reject the &quot;view that an apparently limitless variety
of conduct can be labeled 'speech' whenever the person engaging
in the conduct intends thereby to express an idea.&quot; United
States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 376, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 1678, 20
L.Ed.2d 672 (1968); accord, R.A.V., 505 U.S., at ----, 112 S.Ct.,
at 2544; Spence v. Washington, 418 U.S. 405, 409, 94 S.Ct. 2727,
2729, 41 L.Ed.2d 842 (1974) (per curiam );  Cox v. Louisiana,
379 U.S. 536, 555, 85 S.Ct. 453, 464, 13 L.Ed.2d 471 (1965). Thus,
a physical assault is not by any stretch of the imagination expressive
conduct protected by the First Amendment. See Roberts v. United
States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 628, 104 S.Ct. 3244, 3255, 82 L.Ed.2d
462 (1984) (&quot;[V]iolence or other types of potentially expressive
activities that produce special harms distinct from their communicative
impact ... are entitled to no constitutional protection&quot;);
NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware Co., 458 U.S. 886, 916, 102 S.Ct.
3409, 3427, 73 L.Ed.2d 1215 (1982) (&quot;The First Amendment
does not protect violence&quot;).
<P>
But the fact remains that under the Wisconsin statute the same
criminal conduct may be more heavily punished if the victim is
selected because of his race or other protected status than if
no such motive obtained. Thus, although the statute punishes criminal
conduct, it enhances the maximum penalty for conduct motivated
by a discriminatory point of view more severely than the same
conduct engaged in for some other reason or for no reason at all.
Because the only reason for the enhancement is the defendant's
discriminatory motive for selecting his victim, Mitchell argues
(and the Wisconsin Supreme Court held) that the statute violates
the First Amendment by punishing offenders' bigoted beliefs.
<P>
Traditionally, sentencing judges have considered a wide variety
of factors in addition to evidence bearing on guilt in determining
what sentence to impose on a convicted defendant. See Payne v.
Tennessee, 501 U.S. ----, ----, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 2605, 115 L.Ed.2d
720 (1991); United States v. Tucker, 404 U.S. 443, 446, 92 S.Ct.
589, 591, 30 L.Ed.2d 592 (1972); Williams v. New York, 337 U.S.
241, 246, 69 S.Ct. 1079, 1082, 93 L.Ed. 1337 (1949). The defendant's
motive for committing the offense is one important factor. See
1 W. LeFave &amp; A. Scott, Substantive Criminal Law Sec. 3.6(b),
p. 324 (1986) (&quot;Motives are most relevant when the trial
judge sets the defendant's sentence, and it is not uncommon for
a defendant to receive a minimum sentence because he was acting
with good motives, or a rather high sentence because of his bad
motives&quot;); cf. Tison v. Arizona, 481 U.S. 137, 156, 107 S.Ct.
1676, 1687, 95 L.Ed.2d 127 (1987) (&quot;Deeply ingrained in our
legal tradition is the idea that the more purposeful is the criminal
conduct, the more serious is the offense, and, therefore, the
more severely it ought to be punished&quot;). Thus, in many States
the commission of a murder, or other capital offense, for pecuniary
gain is a separate aggravating circumstance under the capital-sentencing
statute. See, e.g., Ariz.Rev.Stat.Ann. Sec. 13-703(F)(5) (1989);
Fla.Stat. Sec.
<P>
921.141(5)(f) (Supp.1992); Miss.Code Ann. Sec. 99-19-101(5)(f)
(Supp.1992); N.C.Gen.Stat. Sec. 15A-2000(e)(6) (1992); Wyo.Stat.
Sec. 6-2-102(h)(vi) (Supp.1992).
<P>
*2200 But it is equally true that a defendant's abstract beliefs,
however obnoxious to most people, may not be taken into consideration
by a sentencing judge. Dawson v. Delaware, 503 U.S. ----, 112
S.Ct. 1093, 117 L.Ed.2d 309 (1992). In Dawson, the State introduced
evidence at a capital-sentencing hearing that the defendant was
a member of a white supremacist prison gang. Because &quot;the
evidence proved nothing more than [the defendant's] abstract beliefs,&quot;
we held that its admission violated the defendant's First Amendment
rights. Id., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1098. In so holding, however,
we emphasized that &quot;the Constitution does not erect a per
se barrier to the admission of evidence concerning one's beliefs
and associations at sentencing simply because those beliefs and
associations are protected by the First Amendment.&quot; Id.,
at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 1094. Thus, in Barclay v. Florida, 463
U.S. 939, 103 S.Ct. 3418, 77 L.Ed.2d 1134 (1983) (plurality opinion),
we allowed the sentencing judge to take into account the defendant's
racial animus towards his victim. The evidence in that case showed
that the defendant's membership in the Black Liberation Army and
desire to provoke a &quot;race war&quot; were related to the murder
of a white man for which he was convicted. See id., at 942-944,
103 S.Ct., at 3421-3422. Because &quot;the elements of racial
hatred in [the] murder&quot; were relevant to several aggravating
factors, we held that the trial judge permissibly took this evidence
into account in sentencing the defendant to death. Id., at 949,
and n. 7, 103 S.Ct., at 3424, and n. 7.
<P>
Mitchell suggests that Dawson and Barclay are inapposite because
they did not involve application of a penalty-enhancement provision.
But in Barclay we held that it was permissible for the sentencing
court to consider the defendant's racial animus in determining
whether he should be sentenced to death, surely the most severe
&quot;enhancement&quot; of all. And the fact that the Wisconsin
Legislature has decided, as a general matter, that bias-motivated
offenses warrant greater maximum penalties across the board does
not alter the result here. For the primary responsibility for
fixing criminal penalties lies with the legislature. Rummel v.
Estelle, 445 U.S. 263, 274, 100 S.Ct. 1133, 1139, 63 L.Ed.2d 382
(1980); Gore v. United States, 357 U.S. 386, 393, 78 S.Ct. 1280,
1284, 2 L.Ed.2d 1405 (1958).
<P>
Mitchell argues that the Wisconsin penalty-enhancement statute
is invalid because it punishes the defendant's discriminatory
motive, or reason, for acting. But motive plays the same role
under the Wisconsin statute as it does under federal and state
antidiscrimination laws, which we have previously upheld against
constitutional challenge. See Roberts v. Jaycees, 468 U.S., at
628, 104 S.Ct., at 3255; Hishon v. King &amp; Spalding, 467 U.S.
69, 78, 104 S.Ct. 2229, 2235, 81 L.Ed.2d 59 (1984); Runyon v.
McCrary, 427 U.S. 160, 176, 96 S.Ct. 2586, 2597, 49 L.Ed.2d 415
(1976). Title VII, for example, makes it unlawful for an employer
to discriminate against an employee &quot;because of such individual's
race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.&quot; 42 U.S.C.
Sec. 2000e-2(a)(1) (emphasis added). In Hishon, we rejected the
argument that Title VII infringed employers' First Amendment rights.
And more recently, in R.A.V. v. St. Paul, 505 U.S., at ----, 112
S.Ct., at 2546, we cited Title VII (as well as 18 U.S.C. Sec.
242 and 42 U.S.C. Secs. 1981 and 1982) as an example of a permissible
content-neutral regulation of conduct.
<P>
Nothing in our decision last Term in R.A.V. compels a different
result here. That case involved a First Amendment challenge to
a municipal ordinance prohibiting the use of &quot; 'fighting
words' that insult, or provoke violence, 'on the basis of race,
color, creed, religion or gender.' &quot; 505 U.S., at ----, 112
S.Ct., at 2547 (quoting St. Paul Bias-Motivated Crime Ordinance,
St. Paul, Minn., Legis.Code Sec. 292.02 (1990)). Because the ordinance
only proscribed a class of &quot;fighting words&quot; deemed particularly
offensive by the city--i.e., those &quot;that contain ... messages
of 'bias-motivated' hatred,&quot; 505 U.S., at ----, 112 S.Ct.,
at *2201 2547 we held that it violated the rule against content-based
discrimination. See id., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 2547-2548. But
whereas the ordinance struck down in R.A.V. was explicitly directed
at expression (i.e., &quot;speech&quot; or &quot;messages,&quot;
id., at ----, 112 S.Ct., at 2547, the statute in this case is
aimed at conduct unprotected by the First Amendment.
<P>
Moreover, the Wisconsin statute singles out for enhancement bias-inspired
conduct because this conduct is thought to inflict greater individual
and societal harm. For example, according to the State and its
amici, bias-motivated crimes are more likely to provoke retaliatory
crimes, inflict distinct emotional harms on their victims, and
incite community unrest. See, e.g., Brief for Petitioner 24-27;
Brief for United States as Amicus Curiae 13-15; Brief for Lawyers'
Committee for Civil Rights Under Law as Amicus Curiae 18-22; Brief
for the American Civil Liberties Union as Amicus Curiae 17-19;
Brief for the Anti-Defamation League et al. as Amici Curiae 9-10;
<P>
Brief for Congressman Charles E. Schumer et al. as Amici Curiae
8-9. The State's desire to redress these perceived harms provides
an adequate explanation for its penalty-enhancement provision
over and above mere disagreement with offenders' beliefs or biases.
As Blackstone said long ago, &quot;it is but reasonable that among
crimes of different natures those should be most severely punished,
which are the most destructive of the public safety and happiness.&quot;
4 W. Blackstone, Commentaries *16.
<P>
Finally, there remains to be considered Mitchell's argument that
the Wisconsin statute is unconstitutionally overbroad because
of its &quot;chilling effect&quot; on free speech. Mitchell argues
(and the Wisconsin Supreme Court agreed) that the statute is &quot;overbroad&quot;
because evidence of the defendant's prior speech or associations
may be used to prove that the defendant intentionally selected
his victim on account of the victim's protected status.
<P>
Consequently, the argument goes, the statute impermissibly chills
free expression with respect to such matters by those concerned
about the possibility of enhanced sentences if they should in
the future commit a criminal offense covered by the statute. We
find no merit in this contention.
<P>
The sort of chill envisioned here is far more attenuated and unlikely
than that contemplated in traditional &quot;overbreadth&quot;
cases. We must conjure up a vision of a Wisconsin citizen suppressing
his unpopular bigoted opinions for fear that if he later commits
an offense covered by the statute, these opinions will be offered
at trial to establish that he selected his victim on account of
the victim's protected status, thus qualifying him for penalty-enhancement.
To stay within the realm of rationality, we must surely put to
one side minor misdemeanor offenses covered by the statute, such
as negligent operation of a motor vehicle (Wis.Stat. Sec. 941.01
(1989-1990)); for it is difficult, if not impossible, to conceive
of a situation where such offenses would be racially motivated.
We are left, then, with the prospect of a citizen suppressing
his bigoted beliefs for fear that evidence of such beliefs will
be introduced against him at trial if he commits a more serious
offense against person or property. This is simply too speculative
a hypothesis to support Mitchell's overbreadth claim.
<P>
The First Amendment, moreover, does not prohibit the evidentiary
use of speech to establish the elements of a crime or to prove
motive or intent. Evidence of a defendant's previous declarations
or statements is commonly admitted in criminal trials subject
to evidentiary rules dealing with relevancy, reliability, and
the like. Nearly half a century ago, in Haupt v. United States,
330 U.S. 631, 67 S.Ct. 874, 91 L.Ed. 1145 (1947), we rejected
a contention similar to that advanced by Mitchell here. Haupt
was tried for the offense of treason, which, as defined by the
Constitution (Art. III, Sec. 3), may depend very much on proof
of motive. To prove that the acts in question were committed out
of &quot;adherence *2202. to the enemy&quot; rather than &quot;parental
solicitude,&quot; id., at 641, 67 S.Ct., at 878, the Government
introduced evidence of conversations that had taken place long
prior to the indictment, some of which consisted of statements
showing Haupt's sympathy with Germany and Hitler and hostility
towards the United States. We rejected Haupt's argument that this
evidence was improperly admitted. While &quot;[s]uch testimony
is to be scrutinized with care to be certain the statements are
not expressions of mere lawful and permissible difference of opinion
with our own government or quite proper appreciation of the land
of birth,&quot; we held that &quot;these statements ... clearly
were admissible on the question of intent and adherence to the
enemy.&quot; Id., at 642, 67 S.Ct., at 879. See also Price Waterhouse
v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228, 251-252, 109 S.Ct. 1775, 1791-1792,
104 L.Ed.2d 268 (1989) (plurality opinion) (allowing evidentiary
use of defendant's speech in evaluating Title VII discrimination
claim); Street v. New York, 394 U.S. 576, 594, 89 S.Ct. 1354,
1366-1367, 22 L.Ed.2d 572 (1969).
<P>
For the foregoing reasons, we hold that Mitchell's First Amendment
rights were not violated by the application of the Wisconsin penalty-enhancement
provision in sentencing him. The judgment of the Supreme Court
of Wisconsin is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for
further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.
<P>
It is so ordered.
<P>
FN* The syllabus constitutes no part of the opinion of the Court
but has been prepared by the Reporter of Decisions for the convenience
of the reader. See United States v. Detroit Lumber Co., 200 U.S.
321, 337, 26 S.Ct. 282, 287, 50 L.Ed. 499.
<P>
FN1. At the time of Mitchell's trial, the Wisconsin penalty-enhancement
statute provided:
<P>
&quot;(1) If a person does all of the following, the penalties
for the underlying crime are increased as provided in sub. (2):
<P>
&quot;(a) Commits a crime under chs. 939 to 948.
<P>
&quot;(b) Intentionally selects the person against whom the crime
<P>
under par. (a) is committed or selects the property which is damaged
or otherwise affected by the crime under par. (a) because of the
race, religion, color, disability, sexual orientation, national
origin or ancestry of that person or the owner or occupant of
that property.
<P>
&quot;(2)(a) If the crime committed under sub. (1) is ordinarily
a misdemeanor other than a Class A misdemeanor, the revised maximum
fine is $10,000 and the revised maximum period of imprisonment
is one year in the county jail.
<P>
&quot;(b) If the crime committed under sub. (1) is ordinarily
a Class A misdemeanor, the penalty increase under this section
changes the status of the crime to a felony and the revised maximum
fine is $10,000 and the revised maximum period of imprisonment
is 2 years.
<P>
&quot;(c) If the crime committed under sub. (1) is a felony, the
maximum fine prescribed by law for the crime may be increased
by not more than $5,000 and the maximum period of imprisonment
prescribed by law for the crime may be increased by not more than
5 years.
<P>
&quot;(3) This section provides for the enhancement of the penalties
applicable for the underlying crime. The court shall direct that
the trier of fact find a special verdict as to all of the issues
specified in sub. (1).
<P>
&quot;(4) This section does not apply to any crime if proof of
race, religion, color, disability, sexual orientation, national
origin or ancestry is required for a conviction for that crime.&quot;
Wis.Stat. Sec. 939.645 (1989-1990). The statute was amended in
1992, but the amendments are not at issue in this case.
<P>
FN2. Mitchell also challenged the statute on Fourteenth Amendment
equal protection and vagueness grounds. The Wisconsin Court of
Appeals held that Mitchell waived his equal protection claim and
rejected his vagueness challenge outright. 163 Wis.2d 652, 473
N.W.2d 1 (1991). The Wisconsin Supreme Court declined to address
both claims. 169 Wis.2d 153, 158, n. 2, 485 N.W.2d 807, 809, n.
2 (1992). Mitchell renews his Fourteenth Amendment claims in this
Court. But since they were not developed below and plainly fall
outside of the question on which we granted certiorari, we do
not reach them either.
<P>
FN3. Two justices dissented. They concluded that the statute punished
discriminatory acts, and not beliefs, and therefore would have
upheld it. See 169 Wis.2d at 181, 485 N.W.2d, at 819 (Abrahamson,
J.); id., at 187-195, 485 N.W.2d at 821-825 (Bablitch, J.).
<P>
FN4. Several States have enacted penalty-enhancement provisions
similar to the Wisconsin statute at issue in this case. See, e.g.,
Cal.Penal Code Ann. Sec. 422.7 (West 1988 and Supp.1993); Fla.Stat.
Sec. 775.085 (1991); Mont.Code Ann. Sec. 45-5-222 (1992); Vt.Stat.Ann.,
Tit. 13, Sec. 1455 (Supp.1992). Proposed federal legislation to
the same effect passed the House of Representatives in 1992, H.R.
4797, 102d Cong., 2d Sess. (1992), but failed to pass the Senate,
S. 2522, 102d Cong., 2d Sess. (1992). The state high courts are
divided over the constitutionality of penalty-enhancement statutes
and analogous statutes covering bias-motivated offenses. Compare,
e.g., State v. Plowman, 314 Or. 157, 838 P.2d 558 (1992) (upholding
Oregon statute), with State v. Wyant, 64 Ohio St.3d 566, 597 N.E.2d
450 (1992) (striking down Ohio statute); 169 Wis.2d 153, 485 N.W.2d
807 (1992) (striking down Wisconsin statute). According to amici,
bias-motivated violence is on the rise throughout the United States.
See, e.g., Brief for the National Asian Pacific American Legal
Consortium et al. as Amici Curiae 5-11; Brief for the Anti-Defamation
League et al. as Amici Curiae 4-7; Brief for Atlanta et al. as
Amici Curiae 3-12. In 1990, Congress enacted the Hate Crimes Statistics
Act, Pub.L. 101-275, Sec. 1(b)(1), 104 Stat. 140, codified at
28 U.S.C. Sec. 534 (note) (1988 ed., Supp. III), directing the
Attorney General to compile data &quot;about crimes that manifest
evidence of prejudice based on race, religion, sexual orientation,
or ethnicity.&quot; Pursuant to the Act, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation reported in January 1993, that 4,558 bias-motivated
offenses were committed in 1991, including 1,614 incidents of
intimidation, 1,301 incidents of vandalism, 796 simple assaults,
773 aggravated assaults, and 12 murders. See Brief for the Crown
Heights Coalition et al. as Amici Curiae 1A-7A.

Appellants appeal an order of the district court granting defendants'
motion for summary judgment. Colorado Taxpayers Union, Inc. v.
Romer, 750 F.Supp. 1041 (D.Colo.1990). On appeal, appellants contend
that the Governor of Colorado violated their First Amendment rights
by using state resources to defeat an amendment on the ballot
at a Colorado general election. Appellee Romer cross appeals asserting
that appellants lack standing to pursue this action. We exercise
jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1291 and dismiss the appeal
for lack of standing.
<P>
BACKGROUND
<P>
In October of 1988, the citizens of Colorado placed an initiative,
commonly referred to as Amendment six, on the ballot at the Colorado
general election. Amendment six focused on statewide tax reform
and would have allowed the citizens of Colorado to vote directly
on any significant change in state tax laws.
<P>
Appellee Romer, the Governor of the State of Colorado, and defendant
Citizens for Representative Government, of which defendants Phil
Fox and Clark Shaw were members, publicly opposed the amendment.
Appellants assert that Governor Romer used numerous public resources
to publicly oppose the amendment. These resources allegedly included
staff time, equipment and supplies, travel resources, and facilities
at the state mansion and state capital office. Amendment six eventually
was defeated in the Colorado general election.
<P>
After the defeat of the amendment, appellants filed a suit in
the United States District Court for the District of Colorado
seeking relief under 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983. Appellants claimed that
Governor Romer violated their First Amendment rights by using
state resources and the power and prestige of his office to oppose
the amendment. Appellants also asserted that the Governor and
the other defendants combined in a conspiracy to violate the appellants'
constitutional rights in violation of 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1985(3) and
common law.
<P>
Asserting that appellants lacked standing and that they failed
to state a claim for relief for a violation of the United States
Constitution, defendants moved for summary judgment. Appellants
cross-moved for summary judgment. The district court *1396 denied
appellants' motion and then addressed defendants' motion, denying
it in part and granting it in part. The district court found that
appellants had standing to sue, but that Governor Romer's expenditures
were &quot;de minimis&quot; so that the appellants failed to state
a claim.
<P>
DISCUSSION
<P>
On appeal, Romer contends that appellants lack standing to pursue
this action. Because we agree with this contention, we address
only the standing argument and do not address the merits of appellants'
contentions on appeal. In this case, appellants are two associations,
the Colorado Taxpayers Union and the Colorado Libertarian Party,
and a number of individuals.
<P>
Before a party may invoke the jurisdiction of the federal courts,
Article III requires that the party demonstrate that (1) &quot;
'he personally has suffered some actual or threatened injury as
a result of the putatively illegal conduct of the defendant' &quot;;
(2) &quot;the injury 'fairly can be traced to the challenged action'
&quot;; and (3) the injury &quot; 'is likely to be redressed by
a favorable decision.' &quot; Valley Forge Christian College v.
Americans United for Separation of Church &amp; State, Inc., 454
U.S. 464, 472, 102 S.Ct. 752, 758, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982) (quoting
Gladstone, Realtors v. Village of Bellwood, 441 U.S. 91, 99, 99
S.Ct. 1601, 1607, 60 L.Ed.2d 66 (1979) and Simon v. Eastern Ky.
<P>
Welfare Rights Org., 426 U.S. 26, 38, 41, 96 S.Ct. 1917, 1924,
1925, 48 L.Ed.2d 450 (1976)). If a party satisfies these minimum
constitutional requirements, then a court may still deny standing
for prudential reasons if the injury alleged constitutes a &quot;generalized
grievance&quot; that more appropriately should be addressed by
the representative branches. See Allen v. Wright, 468 U.S. 737,
751, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 3324, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984).
<P>
The district court concluded that plaintiffs &quot;alleged sufficient
injury for standing.&quot; Colorado Taxpayers Union, Inc. v. Romer,
750 F.Supp. 1041, 1043 (D.Colo.1990). In support of this conclusion,
the district court stated that &quot;[t]he harm consists of the
additional burden imposed on the plaintiffs by the defendants'
allegedly unconstitutional acts. Like the plaintiffs in Common
Cause v. Bolger, [512 F.Supp. 26, 30 (D.D.C.1980) ], the plaintiffs
here have alleged that their campaign for Amendment 6 would not
have been so difficult (and, in fact, might have been successful)
but for the defendants' acts.&quot; Id. We must now determine
whether the individuals or either of the associations, the Colorado
Libertarian Party or the Colorado Taxpayers Union, have standing
to bring this suit.
<P>
A. The Colorado Libertarian Party
<P>
Appellants contend that the Libertarian Party has standing to
sue because it seeks judicial relief for injuries to the organization.
An organization has standing on its own behalf if it meets the
standing requirements that apply to individuals. Havens Realty
Corp. v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 378-79, 102 S.Ct. 1114, 1124-25,
71 L.Ed.2d 214 (1982). To have standing, plaintiffs must allege
&quot; 'such a personal stake in the outcome of the controversy'
as to warrant ... invocation of federal-court jurisdiction.&quot;
Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Hous. Dev. Corp.,
429 U.S. 252, 261, 97 S.Ct. 555, 561, 50 L.Ed.2d 450 (1977) (quoting
Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 204, 82 S.Ct. 691, 703, 7 L.Ed.2d
663 (1962)). Appellants must demonstrate that their alleged injury
is an &quot;injury in fact, economic or otherwise.&quot; Association
of Data Processing Serv. Orgs., Inc. v. Camp, 397 U.S. 150, 152,
90 S.Ct. 827, 829, 25 L.Ed.2d 184 (1970). The injury must be &quot;
'distinct and palpable,' &quot; Gladstone, Realtors v. Village
of Bellwood, 441 U.S. 91, 100, 99 S.Ct. 1601, 1608, 60 L.Ed.2d
66 (1979) (quoting Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 501, 95 S.Ct.
2197, 2206, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975)), and &quot;real and immediate,&quot;
not abstract, conjectural, speculative, or hypothetical, City
of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 101-02, 103 S.Ct. 1660,
1664-65, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983).
<P>
Appellants claim that Governor Romer used his staff and the resources
of his office to defeat the tax initiative supported by the Libertarian
Party and thus forced *1397 the Party to bear a greater burden
in its attempt to pass the amendment. Appellants claim that under
Havens, 455 U.S. at 379, 102 S.Ct. at 1124, this drain on resources
is a concrete and demonstrable injury.
<P>
In Havens, the Supreme Court found that an organization was entitled
to standing on its own behalf because the organization alleged
that an apartment owner's racial steering practices had perceptively
impaired the organization's ability to provide counseling and
referral services for low and moderate income home seekers. The
Court stated that &quot;[s]uch [a] concrete and demonstrable injury
to the organization's activities--with the consequent drain on
the organization's resources--constitutes far more than simply
a setback to the organization's abstract social interests.&quot;
Id. at 379, 102 S.Ct. at 1124.
<P>
Appellants' argument that they were forced to counteract the Governor's
activities through the expenditure of additional funds is purely
conjectural.
<P>
Such an argument simply does not demonstrate that the Libertarian
Party or its members have suffered a distinct and concrete injury.
At most, the Libertarian Party's allegations suggest only that
the organization has received a minor setback to its organizational
purpose. The Libertarian Party's argument would require this court
to engage in a futile act of speculation in order to determine
the extent of some remote, uncertain injury. This type of conjectural
injury cannot establish standing under Havens. In Havens, the
defendant's allegedly unlawful conduct could be tied directly
to a concrete harm inflicted upon the primary activity of the
plaintiff organization--the organization's counseling and referral
efforts were rendered futile when the defendant turned away referred
applicants. Here, appellants' actions in spending additional funds
simply cannot be traced to the Governor's allegedly illegal expenditures.
It is pure conjecture to assume that Governor Romer's activities
caused appellants to drain their resources. Thus, we conclude
that appellants have not &quot;allege[d] [a] personal injury fairly
traceable to the defendant's allegedly unlawful conduct and likely
to be redressed by the requested relief.&quot; Allen v. Wright,
468 U.S. 737, 751, 104 S.Ct. 3315, 3324, 82 L.Ed.2d 556 (1984).
<P>
The Libertarian Party also argues that it suffered an injury when
its First Amendment rights were chilled. Appellants contend that
the allegedly illegal expenditures by the Governor effectively
imposed a tax upon the Libertarian Party in its effort to exercise
its First Amendment right to petition. Essentially, appellants
claim that the dilution of Party resources chilled the exercise
of First Amendment rights.
<P>
We cannot agree with the characterization of the Governor's activities
as a &quot;tax&quot; on the Libertarian Party or its members'
First Amendment right to petition. The Governor's activities in
no way prevented the Libertarian Party or its members from petitioning
the government. The Governor's activities only commenced once
the amendment was placed on the ballot. The Governor's allegedly
unlawful activities never prevented members of the Libertarian
Party from associating, speaking on behalf of the amendment, or
voting on the amendment. Further, the Libertarian Party and its
members failed to demonstrate that Romer's activities impacted
their ability to petition the government of Colorado in the future.
Thus, neither the Libertarian Party nor its members has demonstrated
that First Amendment rights were chilled.
<P>
The Libertarian Party contends that even if it has not been injured,
it is entitled to standing on behalf of its members. In Hunt v.
Washington State Apple Advertising Commission, 432 U.S. 333, 343,
97 S.Ct. 2434, 2441, 53 L.Ed.2d 383 (1977), the Supreme Court
announced a three-part test for associational standing:
<P>
[A]n association has standing to bring suit on behalf of its members
when: (a) its members would otherwise have standing to sue in
their own right; (b) the interests it seeks to protect are germane
to the organization's purpose; and (c) neither the claim asserted
nor the relief *1398 requested requires the participation of the
individual members in the lawsuit.
<P>
Because we conclude that the Libertarian Party's members do not
have standing to sue in their own right, the Party is not entitled
to associational standing.
<P>
B. The Colorado Taxpayers Union and the Individual Appellants
<P>
The individual appellants claim that they are entitled to standing
as taxpayers. The Colorado Taxpayers Union asserts standing as
an organization suing on behalf of its tax-paying members. Appellants
argue that the Governor illegally used state tax funds in order
to defeat Amendment six and that this misappropriation entitles
them to standing under Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 88 S.Ct. 1942,
20 L.Ed.2d 947 (1968). The district court stated that &quot;[t]he
essence of the plaintiffs' position is that when the Governor
becomes an advocate against a citizen initiative, he has exceeded
the limits of his official power and interfered in the process
by which the people exercise their sovereign right to change the
authority of the officials who govern them.&quot; Colorado Taxpayers
Union, Inc., 750 F.Supp. at 1044. Appellee Romer argues that this
claim is insufficient to give appellants taxpayer standing under
Flast.
<P>
Most of the taxpayer standing cases addressed by the Supreme Court
deal with federal taxpayer standing. The general prohibition against
federal taxpayer standing originated in Frothingham v. Mellon,
262 U.S. 447, 43 S.Ct. 597, 67 L.Ed. 1078 (1923). In Frothingham,
the Supreme Court held that a federal taxpayer lacks standing
to sue to enjoin federal officials from enforcing a  federal statute
authorizing appropriations of public money. The federal taxpayer
attacked the Maternity Act of 1921, which established a federal
program of grants to states to reduce maternal and infant mortality.
The taxpayer alleged that Congress, in enacting the Act, exceeded
its powers under Article I of the Constitution. She argued that
&quot;the effect of the appropriations complained of will be to
increase the burden of future taxation and thereby take her property
without due process of law.&quot; Id. at 486, 43 S.Ct. at 600.
<P>
The Court began its analysis by noting that &quot;[t]he interest
of a taxpayer of a municipality in the application of its moneys
is direct and immediate and the remedy by injunction to prevent
their misuse in not inappropriate. It is upheld by a large number
of state cases and is the rule of this court.&quot; Id. The Court
then distinguished federal taxpayers from municipal taxpayers
and stated that a federal taxpayer's &quot;interest in the moneys
of the treasury ... is comparatively minute and indeterminable&quot;
and that &quot;the effect upon future taxation, of any payment
out of the [Treasury's] funds, [is] remote, fluctuating and uncertain.&quot;
Id. at 487, 43 S.Ct. at 601. Thus, the Court found that the federal
taxpayer lacked standing.
<P>
In Flast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 88 S.Ct. 1942, 20 L.Ed.2d 947
(1968), the Court created an exception to the bar on federal taxpayer
standing in the context of Establishment Clause challenges. The
Court asked &quot;whether the Frothingham barrier should be lowered
when a taxpayer attacks a federal statute on the ground that it
violates the Establishment and Free Exercise Clauses of the First
Amendment.&quot; Id. at 85, 88 S.Ct. at 1944. To resolve this
issue, the Court noted that a court must &quot;determine whether
there is a logical nexus between the status asserted and the claim
sought to be adjudicated.&quot; Id. at 102, 88 S.Ct. at 1953.
The Court then concluded that the nexus requirement for a federal
taxpayer contains two aspects. &quot;First, the taxpayer must
establish a logical link between that status and the type of legislative
enactment attacked.&quot; Id. Under this first aspect, a taxpayer
can only challenge the unconstitutionality of exercises of congressional
power under the Taxing and Spending Clause of Article I, Section
8 of the Constitution. The second aspect requires that a taxpayer
establish &quot;a nexus between that status and the precise nature
of the constitutional infringement alleged.&quot; Id. To satisfy
this requirement, a taxpayer must show that the challenged action
&quot;exceeds specific  constitutional limitations imposed upon
the exercise of the congressional taxing and spending power.&quot;
Id. at 102- *1399 03, 88 S.Ct. at 1953-54. In Flast, the taxpayers
satisfied both aspects of the required nexus because they challenged
a congressional exercise of power under Article I, Section 8 and
because they asserted that the congressional expenditures violated
the First Amendment's Establishment Clause, which specifically
limits the taxing and spending power of Article I, Section 8.
<P>
After Flast, the Court consistently has adhered to the &quot;narrow
exception [Flast ] created to the general rule against taxpayer
standing.&quot; Bowen v. Kendrick, 487 U.S. 589, 618, 108 S.Ct.
2562, 2579, 101 L.Ed.2d 520 (1988). In Valley Forge Christian
College v. Americans United for Separation of Church &amp; State,
Inc., 454 U.S. 464, 102 S.Ct. 752, 70 L.Ed.2d 700 (1982), the
Court held that federal taxpayers lacked standing to challenge
the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare's (HEW) decision
to give property to a religious institution. The Court rejected
the taxpayers' standing argument because the &quot;source of their
complaint is not a congressional action, but a decision by HEW
to transfer a parcel of federal property.&quot; Id. at 479, 102
S.Ct. at 762. The Court also reasoned that &quot;the property
transfer about which [the taxpayers] complain was not an exercise
of authority conferred by the Taxing and Spending Clause.&quot;
Id. at 480, 102 S.Ct. at 762. (FN1) Thus, the Court has indicated
that Flast applies only to cases in which a federal taxpayer challenges
a congressional appropriation made pursuant to Article I, Section
8 that allegedly violates the Establishment Clause of the First
Amendment. See United States v. Richardson, 418 U.S. 166, 94 S.Ct.
2940, 41 L.Ed.2d 678 (1974);
<P>
Schlesinger v. Reservists Comm. to Stop the War, 418 U.S. 208,
228, 94 S.Ct.
<P>
2925, 2935, 41 L.Ed.2d 706 (1974); Flast, 392 U.S. at 114, 115,
88 S.Ct. at 1959, 1960 (Stewart, J., concurring and Fortas, J.,
concurring); see also Taub v. Kentucky, 842 F.2d 912, 916 (6th
Cir.), cert. denied, 488 U.S. 870, 109 S.Ct. 179, 102 L.Ed.2d
148 (1988).
<P>
Both parties mistakenly rely on Flast to resolve whether appellants
qualify for taxpayer standing in this case. Flast does not directly
govern this appeal because it applies to federal taxpayer standing
issues, not questions relating to standing for state taxpayers.
Although neither Frothingham nor Flast analyzes questions of state
taxpayer standing invoked to challenge state taxes or expenditures,
the Supreme Court briefly addressed the issue in Doremus v. Board
of Education, 342 U.S. 429, 72 S.Ct. 394, 96 L.Ed. 475 (1952).
<P>
In Doremus, New Jersey state taxpayers sued the State of New Jersey
seeking a declaratory judgment that a state law authorizing public
school teachers to read from the Bible violated the First Amendment.
The Court concluded that the plaintiffs lacked standing because
they did not allege any direct injury to themselves. The Court
stated that [t]here is no allegation that this activity is supported
by any separate tax or paid for from any particular appropriation
or that it adds any sum whatever to the cost of conducting the
school. No information is given as to what kind of taxes are paid
by appellants and there is no averment that the Bible reading
increases any tax they do pay or that as taxpayers they are, will,
or possibly can be out of pocket because of it.
<P>
Id. at 433, 72 S.Ct. at 397. The Court reiterated that a taxpayer
&quot; 'must be able to show, not only that the statute is invalid,
but that he has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining
some direct injury as a result of its enforcement, and not merely
that he suffers in some indefinite way in common with people generally.'
&quot; Id. at 434, 72 S.Ct. at 397 (quoting Commonwealth of Mass.
v. Mellon, 262 U.S. 447, 488, 43 S.Ct. 597, 601, 67 L.Ed. 1078
(1923)). The Court held that &quot;[t]he taxpayer's action can
meet this test, but only *1400 when it is a good-faith pocketbook
action.&quot; Id. Thus, we must determine whether appellants'
action satisfies the &quot;good-faith pocketbook&quot; requirement.
<P>
After Doremus, the federal courts have addressed the issue of
state taxpayer standing and the type of claim that satisfies the
good-faith pocketbook requirement infrequently. In Hoohuli v.
Ariyoshi, 741 F.2d 1169 (9th Cir.1984), the Ninth Circuit examined
the issue of state taxpayer standing and concluded that the plaintiffs
met the Doremus requirements. In Hoohuli, state taxpayers brought
an action challenging a system established by the State of Hawaii
that disbursed benefits to residents who had descended from aboriginal
inhabitants of the islands. The taxpayers claimed that &quot;their
tax dollars were being spent on a program which disbursed benefits
based on impermissible racial classifications.&quot; Id. at 1172.
<P>
After reviewing Frothingham and Doremus, the Ninth Circuit concluded
that &quot;[s]tate taxpayers could still maintain taxpayer suits
if their pleadings were sufficient. They were sufficient if they
set forth the relationship between taxpayer, tax dollars, and
the allegedly illegal government activity.&quot; Id. at 1178 (citation
omitted). To reach this conclusion, the Ninth Circuit reviewed
Flast and its progeny and found that because the Supreme Court
did not discuss Doremus in the second part of the Flast nexus
test, it implicitly distinguished between standing requirements
for federal and state taxpayers. Id. at 1179. Thus, the Ninth
Circuit decided that state taxpayer standing remained unchanged
after Flast and must be guided by Doremus in its original form.
Id. at 1179-80.
<P>
Based on this analysis, the Ninth Circuit held that the plaintiffs
had satisfied the &quot;good-faith pocketbook action&quot; of
Doremus. Each of the plaintiffs set forth his or her status as
a taxpayer. The taxpayers challenged the appropriation, transfer
and spending of taxpayers' money from the general fund of the
state treasury. Further, the taxpayers alleged that they &quot;ha[d]
been burdened with the necessity to provide more taxes to support&quot;
the program.
<P>
Id. at 1180. The Ninth Circuit concluded that &quot;[t]he pleadings
set forth with specificity amounts of money appropriated and spent
for allegedly unlawful purposes.&quot; Id. Thus, under the test
announced by the Ninth Circuit, a taxpayer must satisfy three
requirements: (1) taxpayer status; (2) the appropriation of monies
from the state's general funds; and (3) the spending of those
funds for allegedly unlawful purposes. (FN2) Under this standard,
a taxpayer need not demonstrate that &quot;her tax burden will
be lightened by elimination of the questioned expenditure.&quot;
Cammack v. Waihee, 932 F.2d 765 (9th Cir.1991), petition for cert.
filed, 60 USLW 3406 (Nov. 12, 1991). (FN3)
<P>
The Eighth Circuit, in Minnesota Federation of Teachers v. Randall,
891 F.2d 1354 (8th Cir.1989), agreed with the Ninth Circuit's
approach to state taxpayer standing. In Randall, the plaintiffs,
a teachers' union and its president, brought an action challenging
the constitutionality of the Minnesota Post-Secondary Enrollment
Options Act. Pursuant to the Act, public high school students
in their junior and senior years could take advanced courses at
two- and four-year colleges, some of which were religiously affiliated.
The plaintiffs alleged that the Act violated the Establishment
Clause of the First Amendment. Protesting the disbursement of
tax money to sectarian schools and arguing that reallocation of
funds reduced money available for his salary, the president of
the teachers' union asserted standing as a taxpayer. *1401 The
district court dismissed the suit for lack of standing because
it believed that to achieve state taxpayer standing, the plaintiff
would have to show an increase in his tax bill under Doremus.
Id. at 1357. The Eighth Circuit disagreed, concluding that Doremus
did not require a showing of an increased tax burden. The court
reasoned that &quot;only a taxpayer really suffers a distinct
injury from the improper use of public money in violation of the
establishment clause&quot; and &quot;that taxpayer standing was
created to specifically permit the airing of establishment claims.&quot;
Id. at 1358. The Eighth Circuit concluded, &quot;we do not believe
that state taxpayers are required to show an increase in their
tax burdens to allege sufficient injury.&quot; Id.
<P>
The Sixth Circuit addressed the issue of state taxpayer standing
in Taub v. Kentucky, 842 F.2d 912 (6th Cir.), cert. denied, 488
U.S. 870, 109 S.Ct. 179, 102 L.Ed.2d 148 (1988). In Taub, a state
taxpayer brought an action against Kentucky, its governor, and
other executive officers to prevent them from spending state tax
revenues in connection with the construction of an automotive
assembly plant. The plaintiff, who paid approximately $1,200 dollars
in state property taxes, claimed that &quot;the action of the
Commonwealth and various officials of the executive branch amount[ed]
to the taking of  private property through taxation for other
than a public purpose.&quot; Id. at 914. After reviewing the federal
taxpayer standing cases, the court noted that few cases have addressed
the standing of state taxpayers where the Establishment Clause
is not an issue, whereas municipal taxpayer standing has been
recognized in a variety of contexts. Id. at 917. The Sixth Circuit
then noted that challenges to the Establishment Clause create
a unique situation in state taxpayer standing cases. Relying on
the Supreme Court's notation in School District of Grand Rapids
v. Ball, 473 U.S. 373, 380 n. 5, 105 S.Ct. 3216, 3220 n. 5, 87
L.Ed.2d 267 (1985), that the Court has &quot;adjudicated [numerous]
Establishment Clause challenges by state taxpayers to programs
for aiding nonpublic schools,&quot; the Sixth Circuit stated that
&quot;[t]his observation [by the Supreme Court] points up the
distinctive treatment of standing when the Establishment Clause
is involved, but does not indicate any rule with respect to other
state taxpayer suits.&quot; Taub, 842 F.2d at 917.
<P>
After undertaking the preceding analysis and reviewing Doremus,
the court conclude[d] that the requirements for federal taxpayer
standing announced in Frothingham control the issue of state taxpayer
standing, at least in those cases where violation of the Establishment
Clause is not alleged.... In order to have standing, a state taxpayer
must allege direct and palpable injury with sufficient specificity
to meet the &quot;good-faith pocketbook&quot; requirement of Doremus.
<P>
Id. at 918. The Sixth Circuit disagreed with the Ninth Circuit's
conclusion in Hoohuli that a state taxpayer must only allege that
appropriated funds were spent for unlawful purposes. Id. at 918-19.
In addition to this requirement, the court required that &quot;[a]
state taxpayer ... tie such allegations of illegal appropriations
and expenditures to a specific claim of some direct and palpable
injury threatened or suffered.&quot; Id. at 919.
<P>
After considering the cases relating to both federal and state
taxpayer standing, we conclude that, where an Establishment Clause
violation is not asserted, a state taxpayer must allege that appropriated
funds were spent for an allegedly unlawful purpose and that the
illegal appropriations and expenditures are tied to a direct and
palpable injury threatened or suffered. Only by meeting these
requirements will a state taxpayer satisfy the &quot;good-faith
pocketbook&quot; requirement of Doremus. A state taxpayer must
demonstrate that she will be &quot;out of pocket&quot; because
of the allegedly illegal appropriation. Doremus, 342 U.S. at 433,
72 S.Ct. at 396.
<P>
In reaching this conclusion, we are guided by the Supreme Court's
decision in ASARCO, Inc. v. Kadish, 490 U.S. 605, 109 S.Ct. 2037,
104 L.Ed.2d 696 (1989). In ASARCO, numerous individual state taxpayers
and the Arizona Education Association, representing approximately
20,000 public *1402 school teachers in the State of Arizona, brought
a suit in Arizona state court seeking a declaration that a state
statute governing mineral leases on state land was void. The plaintiffs
challenged the state statute on grounds that it did not comply
with the methods Congress required the State to follow before
leasing or selling the lands granted by the United States in the
New Mexico-Arizona Enabling Act of 1910, 36 Stat. 557. Because
the state court interpreted federal law, the Court addressed whether
the plaintiffs would have had standing had the action originally
been brought in federal court.
<P>
The Court noted that the general bar on federal taxpayer suits
announced in Frothingham does not necessarily apply to municipal
taxpayers &quot;if it has been shown that the 'peculiar relation
of the corporate taxpayer to the [municipal] corporation' makes
the taxpayer's interest in the application of municipal revenues
'direct and immediate.' &quot; ASARCO, 109 S.Ct. at 2043 (quoting
Frothingham, 262 U.S. at 486-87, 43 S.Ct. at 600-01) (alteration
in original).
<P>
The Court then noted that &quot;we have likened state taxpayers
to federal taxpayers, and thus we have refused to confer standing
upon a state taxpayer absent a showing of 'direct injury,' pecuniary
or otherwise.&quot; Id. (quoting Doremus, 342 U.S. at 434, 72
S.Ct. at 397). The Court concluded that the state taxpayers were
not entitled to standing because &quot;[t]he possibility that
taxpayers will receive any direct pecuniary relief from this lawsuit
is 'remote, fluctuating and uncertain,' as stated in Frothingham,
supra, and consequently the claimed injury is not 'likely to be
redressed by a favorable decision.' &quot; Id. (quoting Valley
Forge, 454 U.S. at 472, 102 S.Ct. at 758). (FN4)
<P>
After reviewing the reasoning in ASARCO, we conclude that we must
reject the Ninth Circuit's formulation of state taxpayer standing
because it equates state taxpayers with municipal taxpayers for
standing purposes. See Cammack, 932 F.2d at 770 (&quot;we conclude
that municipal taxpayer standing ... mirrors our threshold for
state taxpayer standing&quot;). Supreme Court jurisprudence indicates
that state taxpayers must be likened to federal taxpayers. Thus,
in addition to demonstrating that money was appropriated and spent
for an allegedly unlawful purpose, a state taxpayer must show
that a distinct and palpable injury resulted from the allegedly
illegal appropriation or expenditure. To show such an injury,
a state taxpayer must allege that he has suffered a monetary loss
due to the allegedly unlawful activity's effect on his tax liability.
(FN5)
<P>
Requiring a distinct and palpable injury for state taxpayers comports
with notions of federalism that are central to our system of government.
In the federal taxpayer standing cases, the Supreme Court has
restricted standing to prevent the judicial branch from intruding
into the provinces of the executive and the legislative branches.
We agree with the Sixth Circuit that [t]his separation of powers
concern has a counterpoint which should be considered when a state
taxpayer seeks to have a federal court enjoin the appropriation
and spending activities of a state government.
<P>
Considerations of federalism should signal the same caution in
these circumstances as concern for preservation of the proper
separation of powers in an &quot;all federal&quot; action.
<P>
Taub, 842 F.2d at 919. As the dissent in Hoohuli stated, *1403.
Doremus requires a state taxpayer plaintiff to demonstrate &quot;a
good-faith pocketbook action,&quot; which appears to parallel
the core article III injury-in-fact requirement. But when state
taxpayers attack state spending in federal court, another major
consideration operates: the integrity of our government's federalist
structure. Unnecessary or abstract decisions by federal courts
in cases where there is no case or controversy could unduly constrict
experimental state welfare legislation and undermine local self-determination.
<P>
Hoohuli, 741 F.2d at 1183 (Wallace, J., dissenting) (citations
omitted). In this case we have an especially compelling federalism
concern that dictates careful attention to the threshold case
or controversy requirement of standing. This case involves a citizen
initiative effort. The right to initiate legislation is a unique
state-created right. The allegations in this case suggest that
the elected chief executive officer of the state cannot take an
active official role in the state-created initiative process.
We can discern few areas so sacrosanct as protection of state
self-determination. The mere allegation of federal constitutional
violations cannot be allowed to clothe a state governmental decisionmaking
process with the ill-fitting garments of federal court scrutiny.
The &quot;direct injury&quot; requirement for standing that has
flourished since Frothingham and Doremus and that defines the
appropriate litigants in a state taxpayer case proves yet again
the wisdom of the Framers of the Constitution when they tied federal
court jurisdiction to the &quot;case or controversy&quot; requirement
and its attendant standing, ripeness, and mootness doctrines.
This case proves the continuing importance of judicial vigilance
over these time-tested doctrines. Absent such vigilance, we would
seriously undermine the constitutional commitment to federalism.
<P>
In this case, appellants allege that funds were appropriated and
spent for an unlawful purpose; however, they do not allege a distinct
and palpable injury that results from an increased tax liability.
Instead, appellants merely allege that the Governor's allegedly
illegal activities forced them to spend additional funds to offset
his efforts. &quot;[A] taxpayer alleges injury only by virtue
of his liability for taxes.&quot; Valley Forge, 454 U.S. at 478,
102 S.Ct. at 762. Appellants have not alleged that they have suffered
any injury whatsoever as a result of paying increased taxes to
fund the Governor's activities. Because appellants have not alleged
an injury related to tax liability, they have not shown that they
have suffered a distinct and palpable injury as a result of the
allegedly illegal appropriations or expenditures. Thus, the individual
appellants do not satisfy the good-faith pocketbook requirement
of Doremus and are not entitled to standing as state taxpayers.
Likewise, the Colorado Taxpayers Union lacks associational standing
because its members do not have standing as taxpayers to sue in
their own right. Hunt, 432 U.S. at 343, 97 S.Ct. at 2441.
<P>
Accordingly, both the individuals and the two associations lack
standing to challenge the alleged illegality of the Governor's
activities. The appeal is DISMISSED.

FN1. The Supreme Court has permitted federal taxpayer standing
when plaintiffs challenge that the administration of congressional
grants violates the Establishment Clause. See Roemer v. Board

because they did not demonstrate how the Hawaiian plan increases

pocketbook injury, an &quot;especially acute&quot; dual federalism
issue would arise. Id.

standing requirements that apply to state taxpayers also apply
to municipal taxpayers.

funds, and in this way mirrors our threshold for state taxpayer
standing.&quot; Id. at 770.

*1403_ FN4. Justice Kennedy garnered only four votes for the portion
of the opinion that deals with state taxpayer standing. See ASARCO,
109 S.Ct. at 2053 (Brennan, J., concurring). Because Justice Brennan
believed that it was unnecessary to address the state taxpayer
standing issue, he did not concur in this part of Justice Kennedy's
decision. Justice O'Connor did not take part in the decision.
<P>
FN5. In ASARCO, the Court explained why the plaintiff-taxpayers
lacked standing:
<P>
[The taxpayers] have simply asserted that the Arizona statute
governing mineral leases has &quot;deprived the school trust funds
of millions of dollars thereby resulting in unnecessarily higher
taxes.&quot; Complaint, p III. Even if the first part of that
assertion were correct, however, it is pure speculation whether
the lawsuit would result in any actual tax relief for [the taxpayers].

<P>
Opinion for the Court filed by Circuit Judge, STEPHEN F. WILLIAMS.
<P>
STEPHEN F. WILLIAMS, Circuit Judge:
<P>
While attending college, plaintiffs Ernest A. Tuckett III and
William Demps, Jr. also worked as &quot;testers&quot; for the
Fair Employment Council of Greater Washington. In December 1990,
both Tuckett and Demps, who are black, were paired with white
testers also employed by the Council. On successive days, the
two pairs of testers--equipped with fake credentials intended
to be comparable--sought employment referrals from BMC Marketing
Corporation, which runs an employment agency in the District of
Columbia. Both times the white tester received a referral and
the black tester did not; indeed, BMC allegedly refused even to
accept an application from one of the two black testers. On the
basis of these tests, the Council and the two black testers sued
BMC in federal district court, alleging that BMC has &quot;a pattern,
practice and policy of employment discrimination on the basis
of race&quot;. The plaintiffs asserted claims under two different
federal statutes--42 U.S.C. Sec. 1981 and 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e--and
one local statute. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief
as well as damages of various sorts.
<P>
BMC moved to dismiss the complaint for want of standing. The district
court denied the motion but granted BMC leave to take an interlocutory
appeal under 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1292(b), 829 F.Supp. 402; we permitted
the appeal. We affirm in part and reverse in part. While the Fair
Employment Council can maintain a portion of its suit, the individual
testers cannot.
<P>
I. The Individual Testers
<P>
A. Federal Claims
<P>
Neither of the federal statutes that they invoke gives the tester
plaintiffs a cause of action for damages, and they lack standing
to seek the other forms of relief requested.
<P>
1. Claims for Damages
<P>
a. 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1981
<P>
Section 1981 gives all citizens of the United States &quot;the
same right in every State and Territory to make and enforce contracts
... as is enjoyed by white citizens&quot;, language that the Supreme
Court has interpreted to prohibit not only racially discriminatory
government interference with private contracting but also purely
private discrimination in contracts. Runyon v. McCrary, 427 U.S.
160, 168, 96 S.Ct. 2586, 2593, 49 L.Ed.2d 415 (1976); Patterson
v. McLean Credit Union, 491 U.S. 164, 171-75, 109 S.Ct. 2363,
2369-72, 105 L.Ed.2d 132 (1989). The testers assert that BMC violated
their rights under this statute in two distinct ways: it deprived
them of the opportunity to enter into contracts with BMC for employment
referrals, and it deprived them of the opportunity to enter into
employment contracts on referral by BMC. In the context of this
case, however, neither assertion states a valid claim under Sec.
1981.
<P>
As for the first assertion, BMC denies that it enters into contracts
with the people who seek referrals from it. The plaintiffs respond
that this argument assumes factual matters that should be dealt
with in further proceedings. But even if BMC sometimes does enter
into contracts with job-seekers, the testers here made conscious
and material *1271 misrepresentations of fact by deceiving BMC
about their intentions and by presenting BMC with fictitious credentials.
Any resulting contracts between the tester plaintiffs and BMC
would have been voidable at BMC's option, as the plaintiffs appear
to recognize. See, e.g., Rest. (2d) of Contracts Sec. 164(1) (1981).
Even on the plaintiffs' argument, then, BMC did not deny the testers
the opportunity to enter into a contract that they could have
enforced.
<P>
Certainly the loss of the opportunity to enter into a void contract--i.e.,
a contract that neither party can enforce--is not an injury
<P>
cognizable under Sec. 1981, for a void contract is a legal nullity.
From the perspective of the party who obtains a contract through
misrepresentations, however, it is generally worse for the contract
to be voidable than for it to be void; in the absence of any kind
of ratification, a voidable contract simply gives the other party
an option. In any event, the rule that contracts obtained through
misrepresentations are merely voidable rather than void seems
designed entirely to protect the target of the misrepresentations.
We conclude, therefore, that the loss of the opportunity to enter
into a contract voidable at the other party's will is not cognizable
under Sec. 1981. Cf., e.g., Kawitt v. United States, 842 F.2d
951, 953 (7th Cir.1988) (job obtained by material misrepresentation
is not a property right on which constitutional suit may be founded).
<P>
The plaintiffs' second assertion fails because the testers concededly
had no interest in securing a job through BMC. Indeed, they had
promised the Council to refuse any offer of employment that they
received in conjunction with their testing activities. See Plaintiffs'
Rule 108(h) Statement of Genuine Factual Issues (Sept. 18, 1992)
at 17; Defendant Snelling &amp; Snelling, Inc.'s Motion to Dismiss
and/or for Summary Judgment (June 23, 1992) tab 14 at 17. In depositions,
both of the tester plaintiffs confirmed that they would have rejected
any job offer obtained through a referral from BMC. Plaintiffs'
Statement tab 20 at 92 (Tuckett); Snelling's Motion tab 16 at
233-34 (Demps). At most, then, BMC deprived the tester plaintiffs
of the opportunity to refuse to enter into an employment contract
with BMC's clients. This too is not an injury cognizable under
Sec. 1981.
<P>
Our conclusion that the tester plaintiffs are not entitled to
damages under Sec. 1981 arguably conflicts with decisions of the
Third and Eleventh Circuits, but the analysis in those decisions
is not directly on point. In Meyers v. Pennypack Woods Home Ownership
Ass'n, 559 F.2d 894 (3d Cir.1977), overruled on other grounds
by Goodman v. Lukens Steel Co., 777 F.2d 113 (3d Cir.1985), aff'd,
482 U.S. 656, 107 S.Ct. 2617, 96 L.Ed.2d 572 (1987), the Third
Circuit held that fair-housing testers had standing to sue under
Sec. 1981 and 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1982, a parallel provision that guarantees
all citizens &quot;the same right, in every State and Territory,
as is enjoyed by white citizens thereof&quot; to engage in a variety
of transactions involving property. Meyers, however, addressed
exclusively the proposition that a plaintiff's standing is not
defeated by the fact that he subjected himself to legal injury
solely for the purpose of determining whether his rights would
be violated, with the intent to bring suit if they were. Cf.,
e.g., Pierson v. Ray, 386 U.S. 547, 558, 87 S.Ct. 1213, 1219-20,
18 L.Ed.2d 288 (1967); Evers v. Dwyer, 358 U.S. 202, 79 S.Ct.
178, 3 L.Ed.2d 222 (1958) (per curiam). Meyers did not address
whether the testers had in fact suffered any legal injury within
the meaning of Secs. 1981 or 1982. At most, it simply assumed
that the testers had a cause of action under those provisions,
and it may not have considered the issue at all. See Meyers, 559
F.2d at 898.
<P>
Watts v. Boyd Properties, 758 F.2d 1482 (11th Cir.1985), is similarly
unpersuasive. Though the Eleventh Circuit did indicate that fair-housing
testers have a cause of action under Sec. 1982 (and hence, presumably,
under Sec. 1981), it rested this view chiefly on Meyers.
<P>
Our conclusion that the tester plaintiffs lack a cause of action
under Sec. 1981 is perfectly consistent with Havens Realty Corp.
v. Coleman, 455 U.S. 363, 102 S.Ct. 1114, 71 L.Ed.2d 214 (1982),
which held that black fair-housing testers had standing to sue
over alleged violations of Sec. 804(d) of the Fair Housing Act
of 1968. There, Congress had *1272 clearly conferred a cause of
action on the testers; Sec. 804(d) made it unlawful &quot;[t]o
represent to any person because of race ... that any dwelling
is not available for inspection, sale, or rental when such dwelling
is in fact so available&quot;, and Sec. 812 provided that &quot;[t]he
rights granted by section[ ] ... 804 ... may be enforced by civil
actions in appropriate United States district courts&quot;. See42
U.S.C. Secs. 3604(d), 3612(a). Under these statutory provisions,
it did not matter that the testers merely posed as potential renters
or purchasers; regardless of their intentions, the statute gave
them &quot;an enforceable right to truthfulinformation concerning
the availability of housing&quot;. Havens, 455 U.S.
<P>
at 373-74, 102 S.Ct. at 1121 (emphasis added). The question for
theHavens Court, then, was simply whether Congress could constitutionally
confer such a cause of action--i.e., whether the denial of truthful
information to testers caused them any &quot;injury in fact&quot;.
The Court's answer to this constitutional question has no bearing
on the proper interpretation of Sec. 1981.
<P>
b. 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e-2(b)
<P>
The tester plaintiffs also sought damages under Title VII of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964. Title VII declares that &quot;[i]t shall
be an unlawful employment practice for an employment agency to
fail or refuse to refer for employment, or otherwise to discriminate
against, any individual because of his race&quot;. 42 U.S.C. Sec.
2000e-2(b). After exhausting certain administrative remedies (as
the plaintiffs have done), &quot;a person claiming to be aggrieved&quot;
by any such practice may sue the offending employment agency in
court. Id. Sec. 2000e-5(b), (c), (f)(1). This statutory scheme
is much more analogous than Sec. 1981 to the provisions of the
Fair Housing Act that were at issue in Havens. (FN1) For our purposes,
however, the available remedies are critically different.
<P>
Had the tester plaintiff in Havens proved her claims, the district
court could have awarded her damages. See 42 U.S.C. Sec. 3612(b);
cf. United States v. Balistrieri, 981 F.2d 916, 932-33 (7th Cir.1992).
At the time of the alleged discrimination against the testers
here, however, only equitable remedies were available under Title
VII. 42 U.S.C. Sec. 2000e-5(g); see also United States v. Burke,
--- U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 1867, 1873-74, 119 L.Ed.2d 34 (1992)
(contrasting &quot;the circumscribed remedies available under
Title VII&quot; with the remedies available under the Fair Housing
Act). The Civil Rights Act of 1991 expanded the remedies available
under Title VII, see 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1981a, but the new remedial
provisions cannot be applied to conduct occurring before the enactment
of the 1991 statute. Landgraf v. USI Film Products, --- U.S. ----,
114 S.Ct. 1483, 128 L.Ed.2d 229 (1994).
<P>
2. Claims for Prospective Relief
<P>
Since the tester plaintiffs have no cause of action for damages
under either Sec. 1981 or Title VII, their federal claims reduce
to their request for injunctive or declaratory relief. Yet under
City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 95, 103 S.Ct. 1660, 75
L.Ed.2d 675 (1983), they lack standing to seek such prospective
relief, for they have not made sufficient allegations that they
are threatened with any future illegality.
<P>
The plaintiff in Lyons alleged that Los Angeles police, without
provocation, had subjected him to a chokehold that had knocked
him unconscious and injured his larynx. In addition to damages,
he sought an injunction barring the police from applying such
chokeholds in the future. But the Supreme Court held that he had
no standing to seek injunctive relief. Despite his allegations
of past injury, his standing to seek the injunction &quot;depended
on whether he was likely to suffer future injury from the use
of the chokeholds by police officers&quot;. Id. at 105, 103 S.Ct.
at 1667 (emphasis added). While conceding the possibility that
&quot;there will be certain instances *1273 in which strangleholds
will be illegally applied and injury ... unconstitutionally inflicted
upon the victim&quot;, the Court thought it &quot;no more than
speculation to assert ... that Lyons himself will again be involved
in one of those unfortunate instances&quot;. Id. at 108, 103 S.Ct.
at 1668. In short, while Lyons could maintain a suit for damages,
he could not maintain his suit for an injunction because he &quot;has
made no showing that he is realistically threatened by a repetition
of his experience&quot;. Id. at 109, 103 S.Ct. at 1669. The same
rationale, we have observed, would also have kept him from bringing
a suit for declaratory relief. Haase v. Sessions, 835 F.2d 902,
911 (D.C.Cir.1987); see also, e.g., Golden v. Zwickler, 394 U.S.
103, 108-10, 89 S.Ct. 956, 959-61, 22 L.Ed.2d 113 (1969); City
of Houston v. Department of Housing &amp; Urban Dev't, 24 F.3d
1421, 1429 n. 6 (D.C.Cir.1994).
<P>
Here, the tester plaintiffs made several different references
to future injury in their complaint. In general, however, these
future injuries spring entirely from BMC's past conduct. See,
e.g., Second Amended Complaint p 44 (suggesting that testers will
continue to feel embarrassment and humiliation over their treatment
during the tests); id. p 7. To pursue an injunction or a declaratory
judgment, the tester plaintiffs must allege a likelihood of future
violations of their rights by BMC, not simply future effects from
past violations. Lyons is directly on point, for the Court there
denied standing despite the plaintiff's allegation that he continued
to fear that he would suffer a fatal chokehold in a future encounter
with the police. &quot;The emotional consequences of a prior act&quot;,
the Court observed, &quot;simply are not a sufficient basis for
an injunction absent a real and immediate threat of future injury
by the defendant.&quot; Lyons, 461 U.S. at 107 n. 8, 103 S.Ct.
at 1668 n. 8.
<P>
Only once in their complaint do the tester plaintiffs even come
close to alleging that they will suffer any future illegality
at BMC's hands. In their Sec. 1981 count (though not in their
Title VII count), they assert that &quot;[u]nless restrained by
this Court, defendants will continue to deny, on the basis of
race, said plaintiffs and third parties who may be unaware of
the defendants' discriminatory conduct[ ] the right to make and
enforce contracts for employment.&quot; Second Amended Complaint
p 50. The reference to third parties, of course, does not help
the tester plaintiffs establish standing; to satisfy the requirements
of Article III, they must allege that they themselves are likely
to suffer future injury. See Lyons, 461 U.S. at 108-09, 103 S.Ct.
at 1668-69. Nonetheless, the quoted passage constitutes the only
conceivable support for the plaintiffs' argument that the complaint
contains the requisite claims of future injuries, which they sort
into two distinct types.
<P>
First, the plaintiffs assert standing on the basis of &quot;BMC's
continuing failure to refer Mr. Demps or Mr. Tuckett for employment
on account of their race&quot;. Appellees' Brief at 36. This allegation,
however, does the tester plaintiffs no good; as we explained above,
see supra part I.A.1.a., BMC's refusal to act on the testers'
applications does not violate Sec. 1981. And even if we import
the same allegation into the plaintiffs' Title VII count, the
facts as alleged by the plaintiffs would not make out a continuing
violation of Title VII either. The tester plaintiffs sought referrals
from BMC solely on the basis of their fictitious credentials and
their misrepresentations about their desire for jobs. Now that
BMC is aware of the deception, it surely has no duty to continue
to consider the testers for employment referrals.
<P>
The plaintiffs also claim that their complaint, fairly read, raises
&quot;the possibility that as people entering the job market or
as testers they will in the future seek job referrals from BMC&quot;.
Appellees' Brief at 36. But nowhere does the complaint assert
that the tester plaintiffs are likely ever to return to BMC seeking
employment referrals, let alone that they will do so at any point
&quot;in the reasonably near future&quot;. Cf. Lyons, 461 U.S.
at 108, 103 S.Ct. at 1668-69; see also Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife,
--- U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 2130, 2138, 119 L.Ed.2d 351 (1992)
(rejecting standing for want of sufficiently &quot;imminent&quot;
future injury). Even now, in fact, the plaintiffs do not suggest
that there is any likelihood that the two testers will re-initiate
contact with BMC; they refer only to the &quot;possibility&quot;
of this event. That *1274 possibility seems remote indeed. Their
usefulness as testers is minimal because they are now known to
BMC, and indeed it does not appear from the materials before us
that they are still employed as testers at all. Their adversarial
relationship with BMC, moreover, as well as their established
record as deceivers, make it highly implausible that they would
ever return as bona fide job seekers. Cf.United Transp. Union
v. ICC, 891 F.2d 908, 913 n. 8 (D.C.Cir.1989) (court may discredit
incredible allegations).
<P>
The district court overlooked these problems on the theory that
the plaintiffs themselves control whether they re-initiate contact
with BMC. Mem.Op. at 7. But this fact does not excuse the plaintiffs
from alleging that they plan to do so. To the contrary, the Supreme
Court has categorically rejected the proposition that a plaintiff
seeking prospective relief need assert a threat of imminent future
injury &quot;only when the alleged harm depends upon 'the affirmative
actions of third parties beyond a plaintiff's control' &quot;.
See Defenders of Wildlife, --- U.S. at ---- n. 2, 112 S.Ct. at
2139 n. 2.
<P>
In any event, the plaintiffs simply do not control whether they
will suffer any future injury, for they do not control whether
BMC would discriminate against them in any future encounter. Suppose
we could assume that the tester plaintiffs are likely to return
to BMC in the reasonably near future. Indeed, for the sake of
their Sec. 1981 claim (and possibly even their Title VII claim,
see supra at 6 n. 1), suppose we could assume that they will do
so as bona fide candidates for employment rather than as testers.
They would still appear to be in much the same position as the
plaintiff in Lyons: while he presumably could have initiated another
encounter with the Los Angeles police, he could not control whether
he would be subjected to a second illegal chokehold.
<P>
In Lyons, the Supreme Court stated that unless the plaintiff could
allege that Los Angeles ordered or authorized its police officers
to apply unprovoked chokeholds, he could &quot;establish an actual
controversy in this case&quot; only by &quot;mak[ing] the incredible
assertion ... that all police officers in Los Angeles always choke
any citizen with whom they happen to have an encounter&quot;.
Lyons, 461 U.S. at 105-06, 103 S.Ct. at 1667. This formulation
may be hyperbolic; indeed, Lyons itself said that the plaintiff's
standing to seek an injunction &quot;depended on whether he was
likely to suffer future injury from the use of the chokeholds
by police officers&quot;. Id. at 105, 103 S.Ct. at 1667 (emphasis
added); see also International Union of Bricklayers &amp; Allied
Craftsmen v. Meese, 761 F.2d 798, 803 (D.C.Cir.1985) (adopting
&quot;fairly probable&quot; as standard). But see Whitmore v.
Arkansas, 495 U.S. 149, 158, 110 S.Ct. 1717, 1724-25, 109 L.Ed.2d
135 (1990) (indicating that plaintiff whose standing rests on
threat of future injury must show that this injury is &quot;certainly
impending&quot;); Defenders of Wildlife, --- U.S. at ---- n. 2,
112 S.Ct. at 2139 n. 2 (same); Animal Legal Defense Fund v. Espy,
23 F.3d 496, 500-01 (D.C.Cir.1994), (same). Whatever the exact
standard for judging the likelihood of future injury, however,
the tester plaintiffs here have said nothing to indicate that
future violation of their rights is even remotely probable. Indeed,
besides its oblique statement that BMC's treatment of the testers
reflects &quot;a pattern, practice and policy of employment discrimination
on the basis of race&quot;, the complaint does not even address
the likelihood that BMC may discriminate against the individual
plaintiffs in the future.
<P>
For all these reasons, the facts as alleged in the complaint do
not come close to indicating that either tester &quot;will again
be subjected to the alleged illegality&quot;. See Lyons, 461 U.S.
at 109, 103 S.Ct. at 1669. The tester plaintiffs therefore lack
standing to seek prospective relief.
<P>
B. The Possibility of Amendment
<P>
As a fallback position, the plaintiffs claim that &quot;the appropriate
course is to remand to the District Court to permit plaintiffs
an opportunity to amend and supplement their Complaint&quot;.
Appellees' Brief at 37 n. 26. In Havens, which involved a challenge
to a realty company's alleged practice of steering white customers
to white areas and black customers to black areas, the Supreme
Court followed this course with respect to two plaintiffs who
alleged that the company's actions *1275 had deprived them of
the benefits of living in an integrated community. Though the
complaint simply stated that these plaintiffs were &quot;residents
of the City of Richmond or Henrico County&quot;, the Court said
they would have standing only if they lived in neighborhoods where
the company's actions had &quot;an appreciable effect&quot;. See
Havens, 455 U.S. at 376-77, 102 S.Ct. at 1122-24. Because the
complaint was not sufficiently specific about where they lived,
it was &quot;impossible to say&quot; whether its factual allegations,
if proved, would demonstrate the requisite injury. Id. at 378,
102 S.Ct. at 1124. Citing Rule 12(e) of the Federal Rules of Civil
Procedure, the Court therefore remanded with instructions for
the district court to give the plaintiffs &quot;an opportunity
to make more definite the allegations of the complaint&quot;.
Id.
<P>
The Court's later decisions clarify the reasoning behind this
disposition.
<P>
Havens came to the Court on the defendant's motion to dismiss
the case on the pleadings, pursuant to Rule 12(b). Though courts
addressing such motions usually must &quot;presume[ ] that general
allegations embrace those specific facts that are necessary to
support the claim&quot;, Lujan v. National Wildlife Fed'n, 497
U.S. 871, 889, 110 S.Ct. 3177, 3189, 111 L.Ed.2d 695 (1990), Havens
establishes that such a presumption is unwarranted when the allegations
are too general. Even then, however, the contrary presumption
may be inappropriate; faced with such allegations, courts ruling
on a Rule 12(b) motion often should not assume that the claim
is invalid without giving the plaintiff an opportunity to make
more specific claims. (FN2)
<P>
The case before us is quite different. We do not confront a complaint
whose allegations are so general that we cannot tell whether,
if proved, they would demonstrate injury in fact. To the contrary,
the allegations plainly are not sufficient to support standing,
for they simply do not deal with the likelihood of any future
injury to the plaintiff testers. What is necessary, then, is not
the &quot;more definite statement&quot; contemplated by Rule 12(e),
but an amendment adding allegations that the present complaint
does not even touch upon. Rule 15(a) makes clear that the plaintiffs
have no automatic right to add those allegations.
<P>
On the other hand, district courts do have the discretion to permit
such amendments when considering a motion to dismiss for want
of standing. Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 501, 95 S.Ct. 2197,
2206-07, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975); see also, e.g., Gladstone, Realtors
v. Village of Bellwood, 441 U.S. 91, 113 n. 25, 99 S.Ct. 1601,
1614 n. 25, 60 L.Ed.2d 66 (1979); Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S.
727, 736 n. 8, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 1367 n. 8, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972);
Newark Branch, NAACP v. Town of Harrison, 907 F.2d 1408, 1416-17
(3d Cir.1990). Here, the district court did not consider whether
to exercise this discretion, because it erroneously believed that
no amendment was necessary. Accordingly, while we vacate the district
court's denial of BMC's motion to dismiss the individual testers'
suit, we do not order it to grant that motion; instead, we remand
the case for the district court to exercise its sound discretion
over whether to permit amendment. We see no reason why plaintiffs
who win in the district court should automatically be in a worse
position than plaintiffs whose allegations of standing have been
rightly found defective by the district court.
<P>
Of course, a plaintiff's successful effort to persuade a trial
court to take an erroneous view of the law may yield different
equities from those prevailing in the absence of such an effort.
In some circumstances, it might well be an abuse of discretion
for the district court to permit plaintiffs to add new allegations
to a complaint after their adversaries have been forced to spend
substantial time and effort litigating the adequacy of the old
allegations. Cf. National Wildlife Federation, 497 U.S. at 897,
110 S.Ct. at 3193 (&quot;[A] *1276 litigant's failure to buttress
its position because of confidence in the strength of that position
is always indulged at the litigant's own risk.&quot;). But in
any event, the matter of amendment is in the first instance for
the district court.
<P>
C. Pendent Claims under District of Columbia Law
<P>
The tester plaintiffs have also asserted a cause of action under
the District of Columbia's Human Rights Act. That statute contains
a provision similar to Sec. 2000e-2(b), see D.C.Code Sec. 1-2512(a)(2),
and it goes further than the original Title VII by authorizing
suits for damages as well as for equitable relief, see id. Sec.
1-2556. But the testers were able to bring their claim under this
statute to federal court only because it was pendent to their
federal claims. See 28 U.S.C. Sec. 1367(a). As a result, even
if the plaintiffs have a cause of action for damages under D.C.
law, it will be within the district court's discretion whether
or not to dismiss this claim if it dismisses both their federal
claims. See id. Sec. 1367(c)(3); cf. Clifton Terrace Assocs. v.
United Technologies Corp., 929 F.2d 714, 723 (D.C.Cir.1991).
<P>
II. The Fair Employment Council
<P>
The other plaintiff in this action, the Fair Employment Council
of Greater Washington, fares better under our analysis. The Council
does not claim standing on behalf of any members; in fact, it
is not a membership organization. Cf. Hunt v. Washington State
Apple Advertising Comm'n, 432 U.S.
<P>
333, 343, 97 S.Ct. 2434, 2441, 53 L.Ed.2d 383 (1977). It claims
instead that BMC's allegedly discriminatory actions have caused
it injury in its own right.
<P>
We agree that the Council has alleged &quot;injury in fact&quot;
sufficient to satisfy the requirements of Article III. And, though
the Council is suing BMC over alleged violations of statutory
rights enjoyed by third parties, we conclude that Congress did
give the Council a cause of action under Title VII. We also conclude,
however, that the Council has no cause of action under Sec. 1981.
<P>
A. Article III Standing
<P>
Like the fair-housing organization that was one of the plaintiffs
in Havens, the Council has a broad goal of promoting equal opportunity
independent of merely seeking more enforcement of the civil rights
laws. Second Amended Complaint p 5. Its testing program is but
one means toward this goal; the Council also conducts &quot;community
outreach and public education, counseling, and research projects&quot;.
Declaration of Charles W. Jackson p 8 (Sept. 18, 1992). The complaint
alleges that BMC's discriminatory actions have interfered with
these efforts and programs and have also required the Council
to expend resources to counteract BMC's alleged discrimination.
Second Amended Complaint pp 45, 58, 60.
<P>
These allegations closely track the claims that the Supreme Court
found sufficient in Havens. See Havens, 455 U.S. at 379, 102 S.Ct.
at 1124-25. Fairly read, they indicate that BMC's alleged pattern
of discrimination--evidenced by the alleged treatment of the testers--has
made the Council's overall task more difficult. Discrimination
by BMC, for instance, might increase the number of people in need
of counseling; similarly, to the extent that BMC's actions have
made it harder for minorities to find jobs in greater Washington,
they may have reduced the effectiveness of any given level of
outreach efforts. If discriminatory actions taken by BMC have
&quot;perceptibly impaired&quot; the Council's programs, &quot;there
can be no question that the organization has suffered injury in
fact&quot;. Id.
<P>
In reaching this conclusion, however, we explicitly reject the
Council's suggestion that the mere expense of testing BMC constitutes
&quot;injury in fact&quot; fairly traceable to BMC's conduct.
The diversion of resources to testing might well harm the Council's
other programs, for money spent on testing is money that is not
spent on other things. But this particular harm is self-inflicted;
it results not from any actions taken by BMC, but rather from
the Council's own budgetary choices. Indeed, it is not really
a harm at all; assuming that BMC's actions did not have any other
effect on the Council's programs independent of its efforts to
increase legal pressure *1277 on possible open housing violators,
the Council and its programs would have been totally unaffected
if it had simply refrained from making the re-allocation. One
can hardly say that BMC has injured the Council merely because
the Council has decided that its money would be better spent by
testing BMC than by counseling or researching. (FN3)
<P>
We disagree with the Seventh Circuit that Havens would support
such a purely self-referential injury. In Village of Bellwood
v. Dwivedi, 895 F.2d 1521 (7th Cir.1990), the court concluded
that even when a fair-housing organization's other activities
had not been impaired by the defendant's discriminatory practices,
&quot;the only injury which need be shown ... is deflection of
the agency's time and money from counseling to legal efforts directed
against discrimination.&quot; Id. at 1526. By this logic, the
time and money that plaintiffs spend in bringing suit against
a defendant would itself constitute a sufficient &quot;injury
in fact&quot;, a circular position that would effectively abolish
the requirement altogether. Indeed, an organization devoted exclusively
to advancing more rigorous enforcement of selected laws could
secure standing simply by showing that one alleged illegality
had &quot;deflected&quot; it from pursuit of another, contrary
to such decisions as Schlesinger v. Reservists Committee to Stop
the War, 418 U.S. 208, 94 S.Ct. 2925, 41 L.Ed.2d 706 (1974). Havens
did not so hold. The Court there did not base standing on the
diversion of resources from one program to another, but rather
on the alleged injury that the defendants' actions themselves
had inflicted upon the organization's programs. To be sure, the
Court did mention the &quot;drain on the organization's resources&quot;.
Yet this drain apparently sprang from the organization's need
to &quot;counteract&quot; the defendants' assertedly illegal practices,
and thus was simply another manifestation of the injury that those
practices had inflicted upon &quot;the organization's noneconomic
interest in encouraging open housing&quot;, an interest that is
quite intelligible apart from the allied efforts at increasing
legal pressure on civil-rights violators. See Havens, 455 U.S.
at 379 &amp; n. 20, 102 S.Ct. at 1124 &amp; n. 20; cf. Spann v.
Colonial Village, 899 F.2d 24, 27-29 (D.C.Cir.1990) (finding standing
because in order to offset defendant's allegedly discriminatory
advertisements, plaintiff organization had to spend more on its
educational and counseling efforts).
<P>
A corollary of our conclusion is that the Council's standing stems
from BMC's actions against bona fide employment candidates, not
from BMC's actions against the testers. The Council has adequately
alleged that BMC has a pattern or practice of discrimination,
and its treatment of the testers may be some evidence of such
a pattern. Any harm to the Council's programs, however, flows
from BMC's refusal to refer genuine job-seekers for employment.
As this case proceeds, the Council will have to provide support
for its claim that BMC's alleged discrimination has &quot;perceptibly
impaired&quot; its programs.
<P>
B. Cause of Action
<P>
Though the Council has adequately alleged an &quot;injury in fact&quot;
sufficient to meet the requirements of Article III, this does
not necessarily mean that Congress has conferred a cause of action
upon it. BMC has done nothing to impair the Council's own right
to make contracts, nor is the Council even capable of seeking
an employment referral. Instead, the Council's asserted injuries
flow from BMC's alleged violations of other people's rights under
Sec. 1981 and Title VII. This fact triggers concerns about an
aspect of the &quot;prudential&quot; limits on standing: ordinarily,
a plaintiff &quot;must assert his own legal interests, rather
than those of third parties&quot;. Gladstone, Realtors, 441 U.S.
at 100, 99 S.Ct. at 1608.
<P>
*1278 To phrase the principle this way, however, is to beg the
question. If Congress has given the Council a cause of action
to redress the injuries that it is suffering as a result of BMC's
alleged discrimination against candidates for referrals, then
the Council is indeed suing to protect its own &quot;legal interests&quot;.
Cf., e.g., Smith v. City of Cleveland Heights, 760 F.2d 720, 724
(6th Cir.1985). A more precise statement of the principle, then,
is that a statute ordinarily will not be interpreted to confer
causes of action upon people whose only injuries derive from the
violation of others' rights under the statute.
<P>
When the &quot;prudential&quot; limits on standing to raise statutory
claims are understood in this way--as a set of presumptions that
courts use in determining whether the statutes in question confer
a cause of action upon the plaintiff, see, e.g., Warth v. Seldin,
422 U.S. 490, 500-01, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 2205-07, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975);
Hazardous Waste Treatment Council v. United States Environmental
Protection Agency, 861 F.2d 277, 283 (D.C.Cir.1988)--the &quot;prudential&quot;
label seems a misnomer. These &quot;prudential&quot; rules are
simply canons of statutory interpretation, and Congress is free
to override the normal presumptions. In Havens, for instance,
the Supreme Court noted that Congress intended standing to sue
under Sec. 812 of the Fair Housing Act to extend to the full reach
permitted by the Constitution, and concluded that &quot;the courts
accordingly lack the authority to create prudential barriers to
standing in suits brought under that section&quot;. Havens, 455
U.S. at 372, 102 S.Ct. at 1120; accord Warth, 422 U.S. at 501,
95 S.Ct. at 2206-07. Statutes of this sort confer a cause of action
upon everyone who meets the Article III requirements--that is,
anyone &quot;genuinely injured by conduct that violates someone's
... rights&quot; under the statute. Gladstone, Realtors, 441 U.S.
at 103 n. 9, 99 S.Ct. at 1609 n. 9.
<P>
Our case law establishes that Title VII is such a statute. Congress
specifically permitted any &quot;person claiming to be aggrieved&quot;
by an unlawful employment practice to file suit (after exhausting
certain other potential avenues of relief). See 42 U.S.C. Sec.
2000e-5(f)(1). This language, we have held, opens the courts to
&quot;anyone who satisfies the constitutional requirements&quot;.
Gray v. Greyhound Lines, 545 F.2d 169, 176 (D.C.Cir.1976); see
also Trafficante v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 409 U.S. 205,
209, 93 S.Ct. 364, 366-67, 34 L.Ed.2d 415 (1972) (citing with
approval the Third Circuit's decision to the same effect). Accordingly,
if the Council can back up its allegations of Article III standing
with actual proof, it has a cause of action under Title VII.
<P>
Section 1981 is a different matter. A footnote in Gray indicated
that there too standing extended to the full extent permissible
under Article III. Gray, 545 F.2d at 176 n. 18. This conclusion,
however, rested on an unsustainable assumption that the Supreme
Court, in citing a snippet of Title VII's legislative history
to the effect that the remedies available under Title VII were
&quot;co-extensive&quot; with an individual's right to sue under
Sec. 1981, meant that Congress had identically resolved prudential
standing issues under the two statutes. See Johnson v. Railway
Express Agency, 421 U.S. 454, 459, 95 S.Ct. 1716, 1719-20, 44
L.Ed.2d 295 (1975). In fact, as the Supreme Court made clear,
the committee's statement that Title VII and Sec. 1981 were &quot;co-extensive&quot;
simply meant that the two statutes co-existed, with the result
that Title VII did not pre-empt whatever rights an individual
might enjoy under Sec. 1981. Id.
<P>
Moreover, Gray 's view of Sec. 1981 flatly conflicts with the
Supreme Court's holding in Warth v. Seldin. There, an organization
whose members included residents of the town of Penfield, New
York, complained that the town's zoning ordinance excluded people
of low and moderate income in violation of those people's rights
under Sec. 1981. This exclusion, in turn, injured the organization's
members by depriving them of the benefits of living in an integrated
community. Such an injury satisfies the constitutional requirements,
and the Court accordingly has recognized it as a basis for standing
in suits under the Fair Housing Act (which confers standing to
the full extent permitted by Article III). See Trafficante, 409
U.S. at 208-10, 93 S.Ct. at 366-67. In Warth, however, the Court
held that Sec. 1981 was critically different *1279 from the Fair
Housing Act in this respect. Invoking the &quot;prudential&quot;
rule against allowing litigants &quot;to raise putative rights
of third parties&quot;, it accordingly barred the organization's
suit. Warth, 422 U.S. at 512-14, 93 S.Ct. at 2212-13.
<P>
As one would expect, then, other circuits--including our own--have
rejected Gray 's view of Sec. 1981. In Mackey v. Nationwide Insurance
Companies, 724 F.2d 419 (4th Cir.1984), an insurance agent attempted
to challenge his former employer's alleged practice of refusing
to underwrite risks in predominantly black neighborhoods. The
agent claimed that this practice had forced him to forgo the money
that he could have earned by selling policies in these areas.
But while Congress could constitutionally have conferred a cause
of action upon the agent to redress this &quot;injury in fact&quot;,
the court held that Sec. 1981 did not do so. Distinguishing Sec.
1981 from the Fair Housing Act, the court decided that standing
under Sec. 1981 is restricted to &quot;the direct victims of the
alleged discriminatory practice&quot;, at least as long as there
is no impediment to suits by those victims. Id. at 422.
<P>
We too have now explicitly embraced Mackey rather than Gray. In
Clifton Terrace Associates v. United Technologies Corp., 929 F.2d
714 (D.C.Cir.1991), the owner of a low-income housing complex
sued the Otis Elevator Company and its corporate parent for refusing
to negotiate a service contract for the elevators in the complex,
allegedly because the residents of the complex were overwhelmingly
black. The owner plainly had suffered &quot;injury in fact&quot;
as a result of this refusal, for its elevators were deteriorating;
indeed, the city government had taken action against it for violating
its duties as a landlord. Accordingly, we dealt with the owner's
Fair Housing Act claims on the merits. But we accorded a different
treatment to the owner's claims under Sec. 1981. Concluding that
&quot;the direct victims of the alleged discrimination are the
residents of Clifton Terrace&quot; rather than the owner, we invoked
Mackey to hold that the owner could not sue under Sec. 1981. Id.
at 721. (FN4) Accordingly, our law is now in accord with that
of the Supreme Court and other circuits in concluding that Sec.
1981 does not confer a cause of action on persons whose injuries
derive only from the violation of others' rights.
<P>
In arguing that the &quot;prudential&quot; barriers to standing
nonetheless do not preclude its particular suit, the Council cites
Des Vergnes v. Seekonk Water District, 601 F.2d 9 (1st Cir.1979).
Yet that case does not get it very far. Des Vergnes held simply
that Sec. 1981 confers an implied right of action &quot;against
any other person who, with a racially discriminatory intent, interferes
with [the plaintiff's] right to make contracts with nonwhites&quot;;
by the same token, the statute confers an implied right of action
&quot;against any other person who, with a racially discriminatory
intent, injures [the plaintiff] because he made contracts with
nonwhites&quot;. Id. at 14; see also Winston v. Lear-Siegler,
Inc., 558 F.2d 1266, 1270 (6th Cir.1977); DeMatteis v. Eastman
Kodak Co., 511 F.2d 306, 312, modified, 520 F.2d 409 (2d Cir.1975);
cf. Sullivan v. Little Hunting Park, 396 U.S. 229, 237, 90 S.Ct.
400, 404-05, 24 L.Ed.2d 386 (1969) (reaching parallel result under
Sec. 1982). Implicit *1280 in Sec. 1981, these cases declare,
is a cause of action protecting people from private retaliation
for refusing to violate other people's rights under Sec. 1981,
or for exercising their own Sec. 1981 rights. The present case
simply does not implicate this principle.
<P>
The normal presumption against reading a statute to authorize
&quot;derivative&quot; causes of action--that is, causes of action
to redress injuries that derive entirely from the violation of
someone else's rights under the statute--is subject to only one
exception that is even arguably relevant here. Courts sometimes
infer that the legislature intended to authorize such causes of
action when, in their absence, no one would be able to assert
the statutory rights that the legislature created. Because of
this inference, a litigant might have a cause of action even though
his injuries flow from the violation of other people's statutory
rights, at least if both of the following conditions are met:
(1) the litigant's interests are aligned with the other people's
interests, and (2) the other people are unable to bring suit in
their own right. See, e.g., Canfield Aviation v. National Transp.
Safety Bd., 854 F.2d 745, 748 (5th Cir.1988); Flittie v. Solem,
827 F.2d 276, 280 (8th Cir.1987); In re Merrill Lynch Relocation
Management, Inc., 812 F.2d 1116, 1121 (9th Cir.1987).
<P>
But even assuming that the Council's interests are aligned with
those of the direct victims of BMC's alleged discrimination, the
obstacles to suit by those victims are not serious enough to warrant
the inference that Sec. 1981 confers a cause of action upon the
Council. To be sure, the people to whom BMC denies employment
referrals may not necessarily know why their applications were
unsuccessful, and so the possible victims of BMC's alleged discrimination
may not always know who they are. But the Council itself could
remedy much of the problem simply by publicizing the results of
its tests and offering litigation assistance to people who suspect
(on the basis of this new information) that BMC has discriminated
against them. In the present case, as in Warth v. Seldin, &quot;there
is no indication that [direct victims of discrimination by BMC]
are disabled from asserting their own right in a proper case.&quot;
Warth, 422 U.S. at 510, 95 S.Ct. at 2211. Certainly they do not
face anything like the practical obstacles confronting people
excluded from a jury for discriminatory reasons, whose rights
the Court has allowed a criminal defendant to assert. See Powers
v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400, 414-15, 111 S.Ct. 1364, 1372-73, 113 L.Ed.2d
411 (1991) (describing the &quot;daunting&quot; barriers to suit
by an excluded juror); cf. Scott v. Greenville County, 716 F.2d
1409, 1416 (4th Cir.1983) (hypothesizing preemptive discrimination
that could never be identified with any individual victims).
<P>
The Third Circuit has perceived &quot;seemingly inconsistent strains&quot;
in the Supreme Court's treatment of whether &quot;the 'obstacle'
factor&quot; is an essential prerequisite to third-party standing,
Amato v. Wilentz, 952 F.2d 742, 749 (3d Cir.1991), and has resorted
to a &quot;more flexible balancing approach&quot; in an effort
to make sense of the Court's jurisprudence. Id. at 749-50 &amp;
n. 8. But we think the cases can in fact be reconciled.
<P>
Apart from cases involving &quot;the 'obstacle' factor&quot;,
the Court generally has
<P>
allowed a litigant to assert the rights of a third party &quot;only
when the third party's rights protect that party's relationship
with the litigant&quot;. Haitian Refugee Center v. Gracey, 809
F.2d 794, 809 (D.C.Cir.1987). (FN5) In the lion's share of these
cases, the litigant seeks to challenge direct restrictions on
its own activities on the ground that enforcement of the restrictions
against it would dilute or abrogate the rights of third parties.
As the Court has summed up its jurisprudence, &quot;When ... enforcement
of a restriction against the litigant prevents a *1281. third
party from entering into a relationship with the litigant (typically
a contractual relationship), to which relationship the third party
has a legal entitlement (typically a constitutional entitlement),
third-party standing has been held to exist.&quot; United States
Dep't of Labor v. Triplett, 494 U.S. 715, 720, 110 S.Ct. 1428,
1431, 108 L.Ed.2d 701 (1990); see also Warth, 422 U.S. at 510,
95 S.Ct. at 2211. For example, the Court has allowed beer vendors
to assert the equal-protection rights of their potential customers
in challenging a prohibition on the sale of beer to young males,

397 (1976); distributors of contraceptive devices to assert the
privacy rights of contraceptive purchasers in challenging restrictions
on the distributors, Carey v. Population Servs. International,

in challenging the prohibition of certain commercial displays,

108 S.Ct. 636, 642-43, 98 L.Ed.2d 782 (1988). Less frequently,
the Court has allowed litigants to assert third parties' rights
in challenging restrictions that do not operate directly on the
litigants themselves, but that nonetheless allegedly disrupt a
special relationship--protected by the rights in question--between
the litigants and the third parties. See, e.g., Pierce v. Society
of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 45 S.Ct. 571, 69 L.Ed. 1070 (1925) (allowing
military academy and parochial school to assert constitutional
rights of students and parents in challenging state law requiring
parents to send their children to government school); see also
Caplin &amp; Drysdale, Chartered v. United States, 491 U.S. 617,
623-24 n. 3, 109 S.Ct. 2646, 2651-52 n. 3, 105 L.Ed.2d 528 (1989)
(allowing lawyers to challenge federal forfeiture laws that allegedly
violate their clients' Sixth Amendment right to counsel); Singleton
v. Wulff, 428 U.S. 106, 113-18 &amp; n. 7, 96 S.Ct. 2868, 2873-76
&amp; n. 7, 49 L.Ed.2d 826 (1976) (plurality opinion) (allowing
abortion-performing doctors to complain that restrictions on Medicaid
payments for abortion violate the constitutional rights of women
seeking abortions). See generally National Cottonseed Products
Ass'n v. Brock, 825 F.2d 482, 489-92 &amp; n. 15 (D.C.Cir.1987).
<P>
Whatever the precise limits of these cases, they offer no help
to the Council. The Council certainly faces no direct restriction
on its own activities, and the Sec. 1981 rights of people who
seek referrals from BMC are unrelated to any special relationship
between those people and the Council. Under Warth v. Seldin, the
Council therefore cannot bring suit to complain about the violation
of those people's Sec. 1981 rights. See Warth, 422 U.S. at 514
n. 22, 95 S.Ct. at 2213 n. 22.
<P>
* * * * * *
<P>
To sum up, the Council lacks a cause of action under Sec. 1981.
It can proceed with its Title VII claim, but it has a cause of
action only to the extent that the effects of BMC's discrimination
have perceptibly impaired its programs. As for the individual
testers, they have not stated a cause of action under Sec. 1981,
nor have they established standing to seek the only form of relief
that might be available to them under Title VII.
<P>
We remand the case to the district court for proceedings consistent
with this opinion.
<P>
So ordered.
<P>
FN1. BMC still argues that people who lack a bona fide interest
in employment--such as testers--lack any cause of action under
Sec. 2000e-2(b).
<P>
The plaintiffs, supported by the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission as amicus curiae, dispute this reading of the statute.
But because we agree with BMC's alternative argument that the
tester plaintiffs cannot recover damages under Title VII and have
no standing to seek the other relief that they request, we need
not address the issue.
<P>
FN2. The rules become less forgiving as litigation moves along.
When a court confronts a Rule 56 motion for summary judgment,
&quot;[i]t will not do to 'presume' the missing facts&quot;. National
Wildlife Federation, 497 U.S. at 889, 110 S.Ct. at 3189. By the
same token, after the district court has held its summary-judgment
hearing, plaintiffs certainly cannot assume that the court will
permit them to supply any requisite averments through supplemental
affidavits. See id. at 894-98, 110 S.Ct. at 3191-94.
<P>
FN3. For the same reason, we reject the district court's theory
that the money that the Council spent on the second test (if not
the money that it spent on the first one) gave it &quot;a constitutionally
cognizable injury&quot; because BMC's alleged discrimination against
the first set of testers &quot;could have been a factor&quot;
in the Council's decision to run the second test. Mem.Op. at 10-11.
BMC's treatment of the first set of testers did not impair any
of the Council's programs in any way, even though the pattern
of discrimination evidenced by such tests may have done so. The
Council simply decided that its limited resources would be better
spent on testing BMC again than on testing a different agency
or on pursuing its other programs.
<P>
FN4. This conclusion, although not our embrace of Mackey, seems
to be in tension with Gersman v. Group Health Association, 931
F.2d 1565 (D.C.Cir.1991), vacated on other grounds, --- U.S. ----,
112 S.Ct. 960, 117 L.Ed.2d 127 (1992), reinstated, 975 F.2d 886,
900 (D.C.Cir.1992). That case also involved a claim that the defendant
had refused to contract with one person (&quot;A &quot;) because
of a discriminatory animus against someone else (&quot;B &quot;).
But where Clifton Terrace held that A lacked standing to sue under
Sec. 1981 because any such suit would be an attempt to assert
B 's rights under the statute, Gersman took the opposite view.
Reasoning that Sec. 1981 protects the right to make contracts,
we held that B lacked standing because it was A--not B--with whom
the defendant allegedly was refusing to contract. See id. at 1567,
1569. Cf., e.g., Alizadeh v. Safeway Stores, Inc., 802 F.2d 111,
114 (5th Cir.1986) (recognizing cause of action under Sec. 1981
where employer allegedly fired plaintiff because her husband was
not white); Parr v. Woodmen of the World Life Ins. Co., 791 F.2d
888, 890 (11th Cir.1986) (similar, where company allegedly refused
to hire plaintiff because of his wife's race); Fiedler v. Marumsco
Christian School, 631 F.2d 1144, 1149 (4th Cir.1980) (recognizing
cause of action under Sec. 1981 where white students alleged that
private school had expelled them for associating with blacks);
see also Patrick v. Miller, 953 F.2d 1240, 1250 (10th Cir.1992)
(holding that such causes of action under Sec. 1981 are &quot;clearly
established&quot; *1281_ FN5. The one notable exception to this
rule is inspired by First Amendment overbreadth analysis. In Secretary
of State of Maryland v. Joseph H. Munson Co., 467 U.S. 947, 956-57,
104 S.Ct. 2839, 2846-47, 81 L.Ed.2d 786 (1984), for example, the
Court allowed a professional fundraiser to assert its clients'
First Amendment rights in challenging statutory limits on the
amount that charitable organizations can pay fundraisers. But
the Court specifically noted that &quot;outside the First Amendment
context&quot;, the fundraiser's standing would have been in doubt
because it had not shown that &quot;practical obstacles prevent
[the charities] from asserting rights&quot; on their own behalf.
Id. Even within the First Amendment realm, third-party standing
is by no means automatic. See, e.g., Renne v. Geary, 501 U.S.
312, 320, 111 S.Ct. 2331, 2338, 115 L.Ed.2d 288 (1991).

<P>
OPINION
<P>
SPROUSE, Senior Circuit Judge:
<P>
George Mason University appeals from a summary judgment granted
by the district court to the IOTA XI Chapter of Sigma Chi Fraternity
(FN1) in its action for declaratory judgment and an injunction
seeking to nullify sanctions imposed on it by the University because
it conducted an &quot;ugly woman contest&quot; with racist and
sexist overtones. We affirm.
<P>
I
<P>
Sigma Chi has for two years held an annual &quot;Derby Days&quot;
event, planned and conducted both as entertainment and as a source
of funds for donations to charity. The &quot;ugly woman contest,&quot;
held on April 4, 1991, was one of the &quot;Derby Days&quot; events.
The Fraternity staged the contest in the cafeteria of the student
union. As part of the contest, eighteen Fraternity members were
assigned to one of six sorority teams cooperating in *388 the
events. The involved Fraternity members appeared in the contest
dressed as caricatures of different types of women, including
one member dressed as an offensive caricature of a black woman.
He was painted black and wore stringy, black hair decorated with
curlers, and his outfit was stuffed with pillows to exaggerate
a woman's breasts and buttocks. He spoke in slang to parody African-Americans.
<P>
There is no direct evidence in the record concerning the subjective
intent of the Fraternity members who conducted the contest. The
Fraternity, which later apologized to the University officials
for the presentation, conceded during the litigation that the
contest was sophomoric and offensive.
<P>
Following the contest, a number of students protested to the University
that the skit had been objectionably sexist and racist. Two hundred
forty-seven students, many of them members of the foreign or minority
student body, executed a petition, which stated: &quot;[W]e are
condemning the racist and sexist implications of this event in
which male members dressed as women. One man in particular wore
a black face, portraying a negative stereotype of black women.&quot;
<P>
On April 10, 1991, the Dean for Student Services, Kenneth Bumgarner,
discussed the situation with representatives of the objecting
students. That same day, Dean Bumgarner met with student representatives
of Sigma Chi, including the planners of and participants in the
&quot;ugly woman contest.&quot; He then held a meeting with members
of the student government and other student leaders. In this meeting,
it was agreed that Sigma Chi's behavior had created a hostile
learning environment for women and blacks, incompatible with the
University's mission.
<P>
The Dean met again with Fraternity representatives on April 18,
and the following day advised its officers of the sanctions imposed.
They included suspension from all activities for the rest of the
1991 spring semester and a two-year prohibition on all social
activities except pre-approved pledging events and pre-approved
philanthropic events with an educational purpose directly related
to gender discrimination and cultural diversity. The University's
sanctions also required Sigma Chi to plan and implement an educational
program addressing cultural differences, diversity, and the concerns
of women. A few weeks later, the University made minor modifications
to the sanctions, allowing Sigma Chi to engage in selected social
activities with the University's advance approval.
<P>
On June 5, 1991, Sigma Chi brought this action under 42 U.S.C.
Sec. 1983 (FN2) against the University and Dean Bumgarner. It
requested declaratory judgment and injunctive relief to nullify
the sanctions as violative of the First and Fourteenth Amendments.
Sigma Chi moved for summary judgment on its First Amendment claims
on June 28, 1991, filing with its motions numerous affidavits
explaining the nature of the &quot;ugly woman contest.&quot; Also
submitted were large glossy photographs of the participants as
they appeared in the skits, including photographs of the Fraternity
member depicting the offensive caricature of the black woman.
<P>
In addition to the affidavit of Dean Bumgarner explaining his
meetings with student leaders, the University submitted the affidavits
of other officials, including that of University President George
W. Johnson and Vice-President Earl G. Ingram. President Johnson,
by his affidavit, presented the &quot;mission statement&quot;
of the University:
<P>
(3) George Mason University is committed to promoting a culturally
and racially diverse student body.... Education here is not limited
to the classroom.
<P>
(4) We are committed to teaching the values of equal opportunity
and equal treatment, respect for diversity, and individual dignity.
<P>
(5) Our mission also includes achieving the goals set forth in
our affirmative action *389 plan, a plan incorporating affirmative
steps designed to attract and retain minorities to this campus.
<P>
....
<P>
(7) George Mason University is a state institution of higher education
and a recipient of federal funds.
<P>
Vice President Earl G. Ingram's affidavit represented:
<P>
(6) The University's affirmative action plan is a part of an overall
state plan designed, in part, to desegregate the predominately
&quot;white&quot; and &quot;black&quot; public institutions of
higher education in Virginia.... The behavior of the members of
Sigma Chi that led to this lawsuit was completely antithetical
to the University's mission, as expressed through its affirmative
action statement and other pertinent University policies, to create
a non-threatening, culturally diverse learning environment for
students of all races and backgrounds, and of both sexes.
<P>
(7) While the University has progressed in attracting and retaining
minority students, it cannot expect to maintain the position it
has achieved, and make further progress on affirmative action
and minority issues that it wishes to make, if behavior like that
of Sigma Chi is perpetuated on this campus.
<P>
The district court granted summary judgment to Sigma Chi on its
First
<P>
Amendment claim, 773 F.Supp. 792 (E.D.Va.1991).
<P>
II
<P>
The University urges that the district court's grant of summary
judgment was premature. It stresses that there remain factual
issues which the district court should have weighed in its conclusion.
According to the University, the Fraternity's intent in staging
the contest is crucial to the issue of whether its conduct was
expressive. The University also stresses that if given time it
could demonstrate more completely the harm the contest caused
to its educational mission. It is, of course, beyond cavil that
summary judgment should not be granted while a viable issue of
material fact remains. Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317,
322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 2552, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986). Summary judgment
principles require the court to find that the evidence is such
that a jury could not reasonably find for the party opposing summary
judgment. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 252,
106 S.Ct. 2505, 2512, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986). Only disputes over
facts that might affect the outcome of a suit under the applicable
law preclude entry of summary judgment.
<P>
In our view, for the reasons that follow, the district court was
correct in concluding that there was no outstanding issue of material
fact.
<P>
III
<P>
We initially face the task of deciding whether Sigma Chi's &quot;ugly
woman contest&quot; is sufficiently expressive to entitle it to
First Amendment protection. From the mature advantage of looking
back, it is obvious that the performance, apart from its charitable
fund-raising features, was an exercise of teenage campus excess.
With a longer and sobering perspective brought on by both peer
and official disapproval, even the governing members of the Fraternity
recognized as much. The answer to the question of whether the
First Amendment protects the Fraternity's crude attempt at entertainment,
however, is all the more difficult because of its obvious sophomoric
nature.
<P>
A
<P>
First Amendment principles governing live entertainment are relatively
clear: short of obscenity, it is generally protected. See, e.g.,
Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., --- U.S. ----, ----, 111 S.Ct. 2456,
2460, 115 L.Ed.2d 504 (1991) (nude dancing); Southeastern Promotions,
Ltd. v. Conrad, 420 U.S. 546, 557-58, 95 S.Ct. 1239, 1245-47,
43 L.Ed.2d 448 (1975) (musical &quot;Hair&quot;); Berger v. Battaglia,
779 F.2d 992, 999 (4th Cir.1985) (blackface performance), cert.
denied, 476 U.S. 1159, 106 S.Ct. 2278, 90 L.Ed.2d 720 (1986).
As the Supreme Court announced in Schad v. Borough of Mount Ephraim,
452 U.S. 61, 101 S.Ct. 2176, 68 L.Ed.2d 671 (1981), &quot;[e]ntertainment,
as well as political and ideological speech, is protected; motion
pictures, programs broadcast by radio and television, and live
entertainment ... fall *390 within the First Amendment guarantee.&quot;
Id. at 65, 101 S.Ct. at 2180. Expression devoid of &quot;ideas&quot;
but with entertainment value may also be protected because &quot;[t]he
line between the informing and the entertaining is too elusive.&quot;
<P>
Winters v. New York, 333 U.S. 507, 510, 68 S.Ct. 665, 667, 92
L.Ed. 840 (1948).
<P>
Thus, we must determine if the skit performed by Sigma Chi comes
within the constitutionally protected rubric of entertainment.
Unquestionably, some forms of entertainment are so inherently
expressive as to fall within the First Amendment's ambit regardless
of their quality. For example, in Ward v. Rock Against Racism,
491 U.S. 781, 109 S.Ct. 2746, 105 L.Ed.2d 661 (1989), the Supreme
Court flatly ruled that &quot;[m]usic, as a form of expression
and communication, is protected under the First Amendment.&quot;
Id. at 790, 109 S.Ct. at 2753. Justice Kennedy explained: Music
is one of the oldest forms of human expression. From Plato's discourse
in the Republic to the totalitarian state in our own times, rulers
have known its capacity to appeal to the intellect and to the
emotions, and have censored musical compositions to serve the
needs of the state. The Constitution prohibits any like attempts
in our own legal order.
<P>
Id. (citations omitted).
<P>
Motion pictures, too, are included within the free speech guarantee
of the First Amendment. The Court emphasized in Joseph Burstyn,
Inc. v. Wilson, 343 U.S. 495, 72 S.Ct. 777, 96 L.Ed. 1098 (1952),
that &quot;[t]he importance of motion pictures as an organ of
public opinion is not lessened by the fact that they are designed
to entertain as well as to inform.&quot; Id. at 501, 72 S.Ct.
at 780; see also Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., 427 U.S.
50, 62, 96 S.Ct. 2440, 2448, 49 L.Ed.2d 310 (1976) (motion picture
theaters involve communication protected by the First Amendment,
but the state can regulate their secondary effects).
<P>
Even crude street skits come within the First Amendment's reach.
In overturning the conviction of an amateur actor for wearing
a military uniform in violation of a federal statute, the Supreme
Court discussed the statute's &quot;theatrical production&quot;
exception. (FN3) Schacht v. United States, 398 U.S. 58, 61-62,
90 S.Ct. 1555, 1558-59, 26 L.Ed.2d 44 (1970). Responding to the
Government's argument that the amateur skit was not a &quot;theatrical
production,&quot; Justice Black, writing for the majority, stated:
<P>
It may be that the performances were crude and amateurish and
perhaps unappealing, but the same thing can be said about many
theatrical performances. We cannot believe that when Congress
wrote out a special exception for theatrical productions it intended
to protect only a narrow and limited category of professionally
produced plays.
<P>
Id. Although this part of the opinion related to interpretation
of the involved statute, Justice Black proceeded to declare that
an actor participating in even a crude performance enjoys the
constitutional right to freedom of speech. Id. at 63, 90 S.Ct.
at 1559.
<P>
Bearing on this dichotomy between low and high-grade entertainment
are the Supreme Court's holdings relating to nude dancing. See
Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., --- U.S. at ----, ----, 111 S.Ct.
2456, 2460, 115 L.Ed.2d 504 (1991); Schad v. Borough of Mount
Ephraim, 452 U.S. 61, 65-66, 101 S.Ct. 2176, 2180-81, 68 L.Ed.2d
671 (1981); Doran v. Salem Inn, Inc., 422 U.S. 922, 932-33, 95
S.Ct. 2561, 2568-69, 45 L.Ed.2d 648 (1975); California v. LaRue,
409 U.S. 109, 116-18, 93 S.Ct. 390, 395-97, 34 L.Ed.2d 342 (1972).
Most recently, in Barnes, the Supreme Court conceded that nude
dancing is expressive conduct entitled to First Amendment protection.
(FN4) Barnes, --- U.S. at *391 111 S.Ct. at 2460. In Barnes, the
Court reviewed a Seventh Circuit opinion authored by Judge Flaum,
Miller v. Civil City of South Bend, 904 F.2d 1081 (7th Cir.1990)
(en banc), rev'd sub nom. Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., --- U.S.
----, 111 S.Ct. 2456, 115 L.Ed.2d 504 (1991), which thoroughly
analyzed the questions of whether and how nude dancing is expression
entitled to First Amendment protection. The Miller opinion noted
that dance is inherently expressive entertainment, as it conveys
emotions and ideas. Judge Flaum refused to distinguish &quot;high&quot;
art from &quot;low&quot; entertainment on the asserted basis that
low entertainment &quot;fail[s] to communicate a defined intellectual
thought.&quot; Id. at 1086. Applying the test enunciated in Texas
v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 404, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 2539, 105 L.Ed.2d
342 (1989), (FN5) he concluded that nude dancing communicated
a message of eroticism and sensuality, understood by its viewers
as such. Miller, 904 F.2d at 1087. Thus, notwithstanding its artistic
quality, nude dancing was sufficiently expressive to entitle it
to First Amendment protection. Justice White's dissent in Barnes
echoed Judge Flaum's opinion:
<P>
&quot;[W]hile the entertainment afforded by a nude ballet at Lincoln
Center to those who can pay the price may differ vastly in content
(as viewed by judges) or in quality (as viewed by critics), it
may not differ in substance from the dance viewed by the person
who ... wants some 'entertainment' with his beer or shot of rye.&quot;
<P>
Barnes, --- U.S. at ----, 111 S.Ct. at 2475, 115 L.Ed.2d at 529
(White, J., dissenting) (quoting Salem Inn, Inc. v. Frank, 501
F.2d 18, 21 n. 3 (2d Cir.1974), modified sub nom. Doran v. Salem
Inn, Inc., 422 U.S. 922, 95 S.Ct. 2561, 45 L.Ed.2d 648 (1975)).
<P>
In sum, although the Barnes plurality did not explore these views,
it appears that the low quality of entertainment does not necessarily
weigh in the First Amendment inquiry. It would seem, therefore,
that the Fraternity's skit, even as low-grade entertainment, was
inherently expressive and thus entitled to First Amendment protection.
See Barnes, --- U.S. at ----, 111 S.Ct. at 2460;
<P>
Ward v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 790, 109 S.Ct. 2746,
2753, 105 L.Ed.2d 661 (1989); Schad v. Borough of Mount Ephraim,
452 U.S. 61, 65-66, 101 S.Ct. 2176, 2180-81, 68 L.Ed.2d 671 (1981);
Schacht v. United States, 398 U.S. 58, 61-62, 90 S.Ct. 1555, 1558,
26 L.Ed.2d 44 (1970).
<P>
B
<P>
The University nevertheless contends that discovery will demonstrate
that the contest does not merit characterization as a skit but
only as mindless fraternity fun, devoid of any artistic expression.
It argues further that entitlement to First Amendment protection
exists only if the production was intended to convey a message
likely to be understood by a particular audience. See Texas v.
Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 404, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 2539, 105 L.Ed.2d
342 (1989). From the summary judgment record, the University insists,
it is impossible to discern the communicative intent necessary
to imbue the Fraternity's *392 conduct with a free speech component.
<P>
As indicated, we feel that the First Amendment protects the Fraternity's
skit because it is inherently expressive entertainment. Even if
this were not true, however, the skit, in our view, qualifies
as expressive conduct under the test articulated in Texas v. Johnson.
It is true that the Johnson test for determining the expressiveness
of conduct requires &quot; '[a]n intent to convey a particularized
message' &quot; and a great likelihood &quot; 'that the message
would be understood by those who viewed it.' &quot; Id. (quoting
Spence v. Washington, 418 U.S. 405, 410-11, 94 S.Ct. 2727, 2730,
41 L.Ed.2d 842 (1974)). As Johnson and Spence point out, however,
the intent to convey a message can be inferred from the conduct
and the circumstances surrounding it. Thus viewed, the University's
argument is self-defeating. The affidavit from the University's
Vice-President, Earl Ingram, stated that the message conveyed
by the Fraternity's conduct--that racial and sexual themes should
be treated lightly--was completely antithetical to the University's
mission of promoting diversity and providing an educational environment
free from racism and sexism.
<P>
Dean Bumgarner, in his affidavit, stated that the University does
not and cannot condone this type of on-campus behavior which perpetuated
derogatory racial and sexual stereotypes, tends to isolate minority
students, and creates a hostile and distracting learning environment.
Such behavior is incompatible with, and destructive to, the University's
mission of promoting diversity within its student body [and] sends
a message to the student body and the community that we ... are
not serious about hurtful and offensive behavior on campus.
<P>
Importantly, the affidavits establish that the punishment was
meted out to the Fraternity because its boorish message had interfered
with the described University mission. It is manifest from these
circumstances that the University officials thought the Fraternity
intended to convey a message. The Fraternity members' apology
and post-conduct contriteness suggest that they held the same
view. To be sure, no evidence suggests that the Fraternity advocated
segregation or inferior social status for women. What is evident
is that the Fraternity's purposefully nonsensical treatment of
sexual and racial themes was intended to impart a message that
the University's concerns, in the Fraternity's view, should be
treated humorously. From the Fraternity's conduct and the circumstances
surrounding it, we have no difficulty in concluding that it intended
to convey a message.
<P>
As to the second prong of the Johnson test, there was a great
likelihood that at least some of the audience viewing the skit
would understand the Fraternity's message of satire and humor.
Some students paid to attend the performance and were entertained.
What the Fraternity did not anticipate was the reaction to their
crude humor by other students on campus and University officials
who opposed the racist and sexist implications of the Fraternity's
skit.
<P>
Even considering, therefore, the sparsity of the evidentiary record,
we are persuaded that the Fraternity's &quot;ugly woman contest&quot;
satisfies the Johnson test for expressive conduct. (FN6)
<P>
IV
<P>
If this were not a sufficient response to the University's argument,
the principles relating to content and viewpoint discrimination
recently emphasized in R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, --- U.S. ----,
112 S.Ct. 2538, 120 L.Ed.2d 305 (1992), provide a definitive answer.
Although the Court in St. Paul reviewed the constitutional effect
of a city &quot;hate speech&quot; ordinance, and we review the
constitutionality of sanctions imposed for violating University
policy, St. Paul 's rationale applies here with equal force. Noting
that St. Paul's city ordinance prohibited displays *393 of symbols
that &quot;arouse[ ] anger, alarm or resentment in others on the
basis of race, color, creed, religion or gender,&quot; but did
not prohibit displays of symbols which would advance ideas of
racial or religious equality, Justice Scalia stated: &quot;The
First Amendment does not permit St. Paul to impose special prohibitions
on those speakers who express views on disfavored subjects.&quot;
Id. at ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2541, 2547.
<P>
As evidenced by their affidavits, University officials sanctioned
Sigma Chi for the message conveyed by the &quot;ugly woman contest&quot;
because it ran counter to the views the University sought to communicate
to its students and the community. (FN7) The mischief was the
University's punishment of those who scoffed at its goals of racial
integration and gender neutrality, while permitting, even encouraging,
conduct that would further the viewpoint expressed in the University's
goals and probably embraced by a majority of society as well.
&quot;The First Amendment generally prevents government from proscribing
... expressive conduct because of disapproval of the ideas expressed.&quot;
Id. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2542 (citing Johnson, 491 U.S. at 406,
109 S.Ct. at 2540).
<P>
The University, however, urges us to weigh Sigma Chi's conduct
against the substantial interests inherent in educational endeavors.
See Tinker v. Des Moines Indep. Community Sch. Dist., 393 U.S.
503, 89 S.Ct. 733, 21 L.Ed.2d 731 (1969). The University certainly
has a substantial interest in maintaining an educational environment
free of discrimination and racism, and in providing gender-neutral
education. Yet it seems equally apparent that it has available
numerous alternatives to imposing punishment on students based
on the viewpoints they express. (FN8) We agree wholeheartedly
that it is the University officials' responsibility, even their
obligation, to achieve the goals they have set. On the other hand,
a public university has many constitutionally permissible means
to protect female and minority students. We must emphasize, as
have other courts, that &quot;the manner of [its action] cannot
consist of selective limitations upon speech.&quot; St. Paul,
--- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2548; see also Carey v. Brown,
447 U.S. 455, 471, 100 S.Ct. 2286, 2295, 65 L.Ed.2d 263 (invalidating
a ban on residential picketing that exempted labor picketing);
Schacht v. United States, 398 U.S. 58, 62-63, 90 S.Ct. 1555, 1559,
26 L.Ed.2d 44 (1970) (invalidating a law that allowed wearing
military uniforms only in dramatic portrayals that did not &quot;tend
to discredit the military&quot;). The First Amendment forbids
the government from &quot;restrict[ing] expression because of
its message [or] its ideas.&quot; Police Dept. v. Mosley, 408
U.S. 92, 95, 92 S.Ct. 2286, 2289, 33 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972). The University
should have accomplished its goals in some fashion other than
silencing speech on the basis of its viewpoint.
<P>
The decision of the district court is affirmed.
<P>
AFFIRMED.
<P>
MURNAGHAN, Circuit Judge, concurring in judgment:
<P>
While I agree with the majority's affirmance of the district court's
grant of summary judgment, I feel that its reasoning goes unnecessarily
too far. By holding that the First Amendment prohibits any action
by a public university to prevent or punish offensive conduct
like that at issue, the majority *394 goes much further than necessary,
going beyond the facts of the instant case in order to reach a
conclusion unsupported by First Amendment jurisprudence.
<P>
The present case can be decided easily within the contours of
First Amendment law simply by holding that George Mason University's
action violated the Fraternity members' rights by punishing them
post hoc and in conflict with its tacit approval of their performance.
Instead, the majority ranges far to discuss what it has concluded
the law would be absent such permission. The majority opinion
expounds upon the development of First Amendment doctrine and
concludes that George Mason was absolutely forbidden from regulating
speech based on its content. However, the Supreme Court has held
repeatedly that a content-based regulation of protected expression
survives judicial scrutiny if it &quot; 'is necessary to serve
a compelling state interest and is narrowly drawn to achieve that
end.' &quot; Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. v. New York Crime Victims
Board, 502 U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 501, 509, 116 L.Ed.2d 476
(1991) (quoting Arkansas Writers' Project, Inc. v. Ragland, 481
U.S. 221, 231, 107 S.Ct. 1722, 1728, 95 L.Ed.2d 209 (1987)). Accord
Perry Education Assn. v. Perry Local Educators' Assn., 460 U.S.
37, 45, 103 S.Ct. 948, 954, 74 L.Ed.2d 794 (1983);
<P>
Carey v. Brown, 447 U.S. 455, 100 S.Ct. 2286, 65 L.Ed.2d 263 (1980).
Thus, the Supreme Court has recognized that regulation of speech
based on its content is not only permissible but, in limited circumstances,
justified.
<P>
In an attempt to reach a much broader conclusion, the majority
cites from Police Dept. of Chicago v. Mosley, 408 U.S. 92, 95,
92 S.Ct. 2286, 2289, 33 L.Ed.2d 212 (1972). Yet, the quoted passage
from Mosley misrepresents its holding. The Mosley Court did not
rule that Chicago's selective proscription of nonlabor picketing
was per se unconstitutional, but rather indicated that the regulation
would be valid if Chicago demonstrated that nonlabor picketing
was &quot;clearly more disruptive than [labor] picketing.&quot;
408 U.S. at 100, 92 S.Ct. at 2292. A complete reading of First
Amendment jurisprudence reveals &quot;that content-based distinctions,
far from being presumptively invalid, are an inevitable and indispensable
aspect of a coherent understanding of the First Amendment.&quot;
R.A.V. v. St. Paul, --- U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 2538, 2563,
120 L.Ed.2d 305 (1992) (Stevens, J. concurring).
<P>
George Mason's treatment of the Fraternity is not itself constitutionally
flawed, because the University was concerned about the message
of the students' performance, but because of the permission to
give the performance which the University granted. The University,
following the Fraternity's performance of the skit, meted out
punishment to the Fraternity, without any prior indication that
such behavior was not allowed at school-sanctioned events, and
despite indicating that the Fraternity's skit had University approval.
<P>
Actually, forbidding the skit or requiring substantial amendment
was not beyond its power. The University does have greater authority
to regulate expressive conduct within its confines as a result
of the unique nature of the educational forum. Tinker v. Des Moines
School District, 393 U.S. 503, 513, 89 S.Ct. 733, 740, 21 L.Ed.2d
731 (1969) (holding that expressive activity in a school setting
can only be restricted if it &quot;materially disrupts classwork
or involves substantial disorder or invasion of the rights of
others&quot;); see also Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S.
104, 117-118, 92 S.Ct. 2294, 2304, 33 L.Ed.2d 222 (1972) (stating
that the Court had never &quot;suggested that students, teachers,
or anyone else has an absolute right to use all parts of a school
building or its immediate environs for his [or her] unlimited
expressive purposes&quot;); cf. Widmar v. Vincent, 454 U.S. 263,
276-277, 102 S.Ct. 269, 277-278, 70 L.Ed.2d 440 (1981).
<P>
In Widmar, Justice Stevens, concurring in judgment, has provided
an insightful analysis of the special character of institutions
of higher education:
<P>
Today most major colleges and universities are operated by public
authority. Nevertheless, their facilities are not open to the
public in the same way that streets and parks are. University
facilities--private or public--are maintained primarily for the
benefit of the student body and the  faculty. In performing their
learning and *395. teaching missions, the managers of a university
routinely make countless decisions based on the content of communicative
materials. They select books for inclusion in the library, they
hire professors on the basis of their academic philosophies, they
select courses for inclusion in the curriculum, and they reward
scholars for what they have written. In addition, encouraging
students to participate in extracurricular activities, they necessarily
make decisions concerning the content of those activities.
<P>
454 U.S. at 278, 102 S.Ct. at 278 (Stevens, J., concurring in
judgment). In the present case, the University, by officially
recognizing Greek-letter social organizations and participating
in the planning of their events, inevitably has participated in
the activities of those groups. Therefore, it must retain the
ability to refuse to sanction certain behavior which infringes
on the rights of other students. The University need not allow
activity distinctly injurious to its objectives.
<P>
Certainly, the most fundamental concern of a university is to
provide the optimum conditions for learning. The majority concedes
that &quot;the University certainly has a substantial interest
in maintaining an educational environment free of discrimination
and racism, and in providing gender-neutral education.&quot; Therefore,
the University must have some leeway to regulate conduct which
counters that interest, and thereby infringes upon the right of
other students to learn. See Tinker, 393 U.S. at 513, 89 S.Ct.
at 740; cf. R.A.V., --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2565 (Stevens,
J. concurring) (&quot;A selective proscription of unprotected
expression designed to protect 'certain persons or groups' would
be constitutional if it were based on a legitimate determination
that the harm created by the regulated expression differs from
that created by the unregulated expression.&quot;).
<P>
By concluding that a university must be allowed to regulate expressive
conduct which runs directly counter to its mission, I do not mean
to imply that a university has the unrestricted power to silence
entirely certain perspectives. I wholeheartedly believe that the
free exchange of ideas and debate are fundamental to a place of
learning. Yet, they comprise only part of a university's mission
and must be balanced against a university's other interests, especially
those interests which rise to the level of constitutional significance.
(FN*)
<P>
Moreover, if the University, in advance, had refused to allow
the Fraternity to perform its intended skit, the marketplace of
ideas would hardly have been endangered. The Fraternity, if it
wished, could have presented its ideas and perspectives on the
value of women and Blacks in an open debate, allowing other students
to challenge its perspective.
<P>
All in all, my concurrence rests on the unrevoked permission to
give the skit. I find it unnecessary, and of doubtful validity,
to suggest that, regardless of such approval, there was any First
Amendment provision guaranteeing the right to give the skit, in
circumstances under which it was inextricably linked with George
Mason University.
<P>
FN1. Although Sigma Chi's national fraternity is not involved
in the litigation, the IOTA Chapter XI is hereafter referred to
as &quot;Sigma Chi&quot; or &quot;the Fraternity.&quot;
<P>
FN2. Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance,
regulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the
District of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any
citizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction
thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities
secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party
injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding
for redress....
<P>
42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983.
<P>
FN3. 10 U.S.C. Sec. 772(f) provides:
<P>
While portraying a member of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine
Corps, an actor in a theatrical or motion-picture production may
wear the uniform of that armed force if the portrayal does not
tend to discredit that armed force.
<P>
FN4. At least eight justices agreed that First Amendment protection
extends to nude dancing, but they differed in their approaches
to defining that protection. Justice Rehnquist, writing for a
plurality, relied on the four-part test announced in United States
v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968).
He concluded that the Indiana statute prohibiting public nudity
was constitutional because it was unrelated to the suppression
of speech, infringed only incidentally on protected expression,
and furthered the important government interest of prohibiting
public nudity. Justice Scalia concurred in the result, but wrote
separately because he believed the statute regulated conduct,
not expression. Justice Souter also wrote separately because he
believed that the state's interest was to combat secondary effects,
an interest unrelated to the suppression of expression.
<P>
Justice White, joined by Justices Marshall, Blackmun, and Stevens,
dissented, stating that the Indiana statute targeted the erotic
message communicated by nude dancing. He would have applied a
higher standard of scrutiny than the O'Brien test requires. *395_
<P>
Because the sanctions imposed in this case targeted the message
communicated by Sigma Chi's skit and are thus related to the suppression
of speech, we do not rely on the O'Brien balancing test as the
Barnes plurality did.
<P>
FN5. In Texas v. Johnson, discussed infra, the Supreme Court stated:
<P>
In deciding whether particular conduct possesses sufficient communicative
elements to bring the First Amendment into play, we have asked
whether &quot;[a]n intent to convey a particularized message was
present, and [whether] the likelihood was great that the message
would be understood by those who viewed it.&quot;
<P>
Johnson, 491 U.S. at 404, 109 S.Ct. at 2539 (quoting Spence v.
Washington, 418 U.S. 405, 410-11, 94 S.Ct. 2727, 2730, 41 L.Ed.2d
842 (1974)). FN6. We think this conclusion gains support from
City of Lakewood v. Plain Dealer Publishing Co., 486 U.S. 750,
108 S.Ct. 2138, 100 L.Ed.2d 771 (1988), in which the Supreme Court
said that one factor weighing in the equation of whether conduct
is expressive is &quot;whether the activity in question is commonly
associated with expression.&quot; Id. at 769, 108 S.Ct. at 2150.
A live, albeit crude, skit performed for an audience is an activity
commonly associated with expression.
<P>
FN7. Nor can we accept the University's contention that the sanctions
were imposed as a result of the Fraternity's &quot;pure conduct,&quot;
unrelated to its communicative aspects or viewpoint. See Arcara
v. Cloud Books, Inc., 478 U.S. 697, 702-05, 106 S.Ct. 3172, 3175-77,
92 L.Ed.2d 568 (1986); Clark v. Community for Creative Non-Violence,
468 U.S. 288, 293 &amp; n. 5, 104 S.Ct. 3065, 3069 &amp; n. 5,
82 L.Ed.2d 221 (1984); United States v. O'Brien, 391 U.S. 367,
376, 88 S.Ct. 1673, 1678, 20 L.Ed.2d 672 (1968); Kovacs v. Cooper,
336 U.S. 77, 89, 69 S.Ct. 448, 454, 93 L.Ed. 513 (1949). The University's
affidavits clearly point to the contrary conclusion.
<P>
FN8. In St. Paul, the Court rejected the Minnesota Supreme Court's
pronouncement that St. Paul's &quot;hate speech&quot; ordinance
was narrowly tailored to serve St. Paul's compelling interest
in &quot;ensur[ing] the basic human rights of members of groups
that ha[d] historically been subjected to discrimination.&quot;
St. Paul, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2549. Although the Court
acknowledged that this interest was compelling, it concluded that
the content discrimination contained in the ordinance was not
&quot;reasonably necessary to achieve St. Paul's compelling interests.&quot;
Id.
<P>
FN* In a case decided one month prior to R.A.V., the Supreme Court
noted that among the most difficult First Amendment cases were
those requiring a reconciliation of our commitment to free speech
with our commitment to other constitutional rights. Burson v.
Freeman, --- U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 1846, 1851, 119 L.Ed.2d
5 (1992). In Burson, the Court ultimately upheld the content-based
regulation, namely, a Tennessee law prohibiting election-day political
speeches within 100 feet of a polling place, holding that the
State's interest in protecting the right to vote was sufficiently
compelling.

MEMORANDUM OPINION
<P>
HILTON, District Judge.
<P>
This matter comes before the court on plaintiffs' motion for summary
judgment and defendants' motion to dismiss. In this action, the
plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief for George Mason
University's imposition of discipline on the plaintiff fraternity
which has allegedly abridged the plaintiffs' right of free speech.
Plaintiffs argue that the discipline imposed upon *793 them unconstitutionally
punishes expression protected by the First Amendment. Defendants
contend that the plaintiffs' conduct was not protected speech
and that if protected speech, George Mason University has compelling
educational interests at stake which justify the discipline imposed
on plaintiffs.
<P>
This action arises under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to
the United States Constitution and 42 U.S.C. Sec. 1983. This court
has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Secs.
1331 and 1343 and may give declaratory relief pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
Sec. 2201. The plaintiffs in this action are the Iota Xi Chapter
of Sigma Chi Fraternity which is at George Mason University (GMU)
and two members of the fraternity, the president and the immediate
past president of the chapter. Defendant GMU is a public university
maintained and funded in significant part by the Commonwealth
of Virginia which was acting as an educational institution at
all relevant times. Defendant Dean Bumgarner is the associate
vice president and dean of student services at GMU who was acting
on behalf of GMU at all relevant times.
<P>
For the past two years, a week long event known as Derby Days
has been held at GMU by the Iota Xi chapter of Sigma Chi. Derby
Days is a major social event for the chapter and is held to raise
money for charity. One event during Derby Days has traditionally
been the &quot;Dress A Sig&quot; contest in which members of the
fraternity dress as caricatures of &quot;ugly women&quot;.
<P>
During the week of March 11, 1991, Dominic Lapus, an Iota Xi chapter
member acting as co-chair of the 1991 Derby Days program, submitted
the printed Derby Days program for approval to Kathryn Schilling,
GMU's assistant director of student organizations and programs.
The program listed the following as one event: &quot;Dress a SIG
contest (dress coaches like ugly women.)&quot;. As in former years,
university approval was sought. Ms. Schilling approved the Derby
Days program on behalf of the university, after requiring numerous
changes to be made in the proposed program. She required no changes
whatsoever to be made relative to the proposed &quot;ugly woman&quot;
contest.
<P>
The &quot;Dress A Sig&quot; event took place on April 4, 1991
in the cafeteria of the student union building on the campus of
GMU. In that event, one of the participants dressed in black face,
used pillows to represent breasts and buttocks and wore a black
wig with curlers. One week later, several GMU student leaders
signed a letter to Dean Bumgarner requesting the imposition of
sanctions on the Iota Xi chapter of Sigma Chi as the &quot;Dress
A Sig&quot; contest had offended them because it perpetuated racial
and sexual stereotypes. On April 19, 1991 Dean Bumgarner announced
the proposed discipline and clarified that discipline in a letter
on May 1, 1991. The discipline imposed by Dean Bumgarner and GMU
prevents the plaintiffs from holding social and sports activities
for a two year probationary period and, during that same period,
requires the chapter to submit other planned activities to the
university for advance approval.
<P>
Plaintiffs and defendants agree that the First Amendment claims
are ripe for summary judgment. As there are no material facts
in dispute on the First Amendment claims, it is proper to resolve
this issue on summary judgment.
<P>
One of the fundamental rights secured by the First Amendment is
that of free, uncensored expression, even on matters some may
think are trivial, vulgar or profane. Berger v. Battaglia, 779
F.2d 992, 1000 (4th Cir.1985), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1159, 106
S.Ct. 2278, 90 L.Ed.2d 720 (1986). Because that fundamental right
extends to students at a state university, a state university
may not hinder the exercise of First Amendment rights simply because
it feels that exposure to a given group's ideas may be somehow
harmful to certain students. Gay Alliance of Students v. Matthews,
544 F.2d 162, 166 (4th Cir.1976); Healy v. James, 408 U.S. 169,
187-88, 92 S.Ct. 2338, 2349-50, 33 L.Ed.2d 266 (1972).
<P>
Plaintiffs assert that the discipline imposed by GMU unconstitutionally
punishes expression protected by the First *794 Amendment. Defendants,
however, argue that the behavior of the plaintiffs at the &quot;Dress
A Sig&quot; contest was not expressive and therefore, not protected
speech. Defendants contend that only political and social speech
are protected by the First Amendment and that this conduct is
neither. However, the Supreme Court has held that activity such
as nude dancing and performance in black face are protected expression
under the First Amendment. Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., --- U.S.
----, 111 S.Ct. 2456, 115 L.Ed.2d 504 (1991); Schad v. Borough
of Mt. Ephraim, 452 U.S. 61, 101 S.Ct. 2176, 68 L.Ed.2d 671 (1981);
Berger v. Battaglia, 779 F.2d 992 (4th Cir.1985), cert. denied,
476 U.S. 1159, 106 S.Ct. 2278, 90 L.Ed.2d 720 (1986).
<P>
In Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., --- U.S. ----, 111 S.Ct. 2456,
115 L.Ed.2d 504 (1991), Indiana enforced a public indecency law
which prevented the respondent establishments from providing totally
nude dancing as entertainment. Although nude dancing was protected
by the First Amendment, the Court held that the Indiana public
indecency law was permissible. The Court found that the Indiana
law sought to regulate conduct, specifically public nudity, and
not an expressive message. 111 S.Ct. at 2463. The Court noted
that &quot; 'It is possible to find some kernel of expression
in almost every activity a person undertakes ... but such a kernel
is not sufficient to bring the activity within the protection
of the First Amendment.' &quot; Id. at 2462 (quoting Dallas v.
Stanglin, 490 U.S. 19, 25, 109 S.Ct. 1591, 1595, 104 L.Ed.2d 18
(1989)).
<P>
In this case, however, GMU did not seek to regulate any conduct
whatsoever. It was not the conduct of renting the auditorium,
holding Derby Days, raising money for charity, providing entertainment,
or performing a skit which prompted GMU to discipline the members
of Sigma Chi. To the contrary, it was the expressive message conveyed
by the skit which was perceived as offensive by several student
groups which prompted GMU to discipline the fraternity. This skit
contained more than a kernel of expression; therefore, the activity
demands First Amendment protection.
<P>
Even if the activity is protected, the defendants contend that
any infringement on the First Amendment rights of the Sigma Chi
fraternity is permissible because compelling educational interests
are at stake. In particular, the defendants assert that Sigma
Chi's behavior undermines the education of minority and women
students, the university's mission to promote learning through
a culturally diverse student body, the university's mission to
eliminate racist and sexist behavior on campus and the university's
mission to accomplish maximal desegregation of its student body.
Although the university has these interests, there has been no
substantial or material disruption of GMU's educational mission.
See Bethel School District No. 403 v. Fraser, 478 U.S. 675, 106
S.Ct. 3159, 92 L.Ed.2d 549 (1986); Healy v. James, 408 U.S. 169,
92 S.Ct. 2338, 33 L.Ed.2d 266 (1972); Crosby v. Holsinger, 852
F.2d 801 (4th Cir.1988). The student activity at issue in this
action is consistent with GMU's educational mission in conveying
ideas and promoting the free flow and expression of those ideas.
<P>
Furthermore, defendants have only alleged general, unspecified
claims of harm to the students who were exposed to the &quot;Dress
A Sig&quot; contest. &quot;The First Amendment does not guarantee
that other concepts virtually sacred to our Nation as a whole--such
as the principle that discrimination based on race is odious and
destructive--will go unquestioned in the marketplace of ideas.&quot;
Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397, 109 S.Ct. 2533, 2546, 105 L.Ed.2d
342 (1989). As noted by the Fourth Circuit in Berger v. Battaglia
a more appropriate response to the activities of the fraternity,
and one consistent with the First Amendment &quot;would have been
instead to say to those offended by ... [the] speech that their
right to protest that speech by all peaceable means would be as
stringently safeguarded ... as would ... [the] right to engage
in it.&quot; Berger, 779 F.2d at 1001.
<P>
Defendants also raise the issue of whether or not the cafeteria
auditorium used by the plaintiffs is a public forum. However,
that is not a compelling issue since GMU *795. permits the cafeteria
auditorium to be used upon written application by student groups
to hold charity events and to perform skits. In fact, GMU approved
the plaintiffs' application to use the cafeteria auditorium on
April 4, 1991.
<P>
Although appropriate time, place and manner restrictions on free
expression are permissible, a state university may not suppress
expression because it finds that expression offensive. See Piarowski
v. Illinois Community College, 759 F.2d 625, 630 (7th Cir.) (racially
and sexually offensive art work not subject to outright suppression
by state school), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 1007, 106 S.Ct. 528,
88 L.Ed.2d 460 (1985). In this instance GMU has disciplined the
members of Sigma Chi because the activity was deemed offensive
by them and not because the members violated any time, place or
manner regulations imposed by the university on the &quot;Dress
A Sig&quot; contest. In fact, Sigma Chi submitted a copy of a
schedule of proposed events for Derby Days, including the &quot;Dress
A Sig&quot; event, to the assistant director of student organizations
and programs at GMU. At that time no objections to the event were
made by GMU. &quot;If there is a bedrock principle underlying
the First Amendment, it is that the Government may not prohibit
the expression of an idea simply because society finds the idea
itself offensive or disagreeable.&quot; Texas v. Johnson, 109
S.Ct. at 2544. The First Amendment does not recognize exceptions
for bigotry, racism, and religious intolerance or ideas or matters
some may deem trivial, vulgar or profane.
<P>
Plaintiffs' expression occurred at a charity social event in the
cafeteria of the student union before an audience composed of
students and non-students who paid money to witness a performance.
Although the university disagreed with the message propounded
by the fraternity's activity, GMU may not discipline the students
by infringing on their First Amendment rights based on the perceived
offensive content of the activity. &quot;[O]ne of the most persistent
and insidious threats to first amendment rights has been that
posed by the 'heckler's veto,' imposed by the successful importuning
of government to curtail 'offensive' speech at peril of suffering
disruptions of public order.&quot; Berger, 779 F.2d at 1001 (citations
omitted). In this instance, GMU sought to discipline the students
based precisely on the &quot;heckler's veto&quot;. That is not
permissible.
<P>
The court need not reach the defendants' motion to dismiss as
this summary judgment motion is dispositive. Summary judgment
is granted in favor of the plaintiffs and the defendants are enjoined
from imposing any discipline on the plaintiffs as a result of
the activity of April 4, 1991.

<h2>Introduction & Summary</h2>

<P>        America is in the midst of an historic period of  dynamic change and
opportunity driven by a transformation of  technology.  In 1995, one half of
all capital investment in America, broadly defined, will be in computers and
telecommunications equipment. The telecommunications industry already
constitutes one seventh of our economy and is growing.  By the early 21st
century, the global information industry is expected to be a $3 trillion
market.  Yet the government statutory and regulatory system now in place was
erected in the 1930s during the New Deal and embodies the limits and
technological realities of a long-vanished era.

<P>        To seize the opportunities of the knowledge age, a new, modern and efficient
governmental role with respect to telecommunications is needed.  Government
can, and indeed should, perform certain tasks.  This report is an effort to
identify and focus on the essential governmental functions needed for America
to enter the new century -- and to cleanse the detritus of the past.  Many
current governmental institutions and regulations are relics of past
practices and  seek to perform tasks better performed by competitive markets.
 The report has a simple goal: to provide for a modern and effective
government to complement market forces to speed the development of  new
products and services for Americans.

<P>        The new, smaller government role (hereafter the <I>Replacement Model</I>) is
based on a functional analysis of what a government should be for a digital
era of the 1990s and beyond.  A functional analysis reveals certain
overarching principles which are applied by the Replacement Model.
 Conceptually, a functional analysis supports a government role for ensuring
parity of  opportunity  across media such as wireline, cellular, broadcast,
DBS and video dialtone.  The success of any one company or even industry
should reflect their inherent attributes rather than their relative
regulatory handicaps.  With respect to mission, the Replacement Model will
provide for a new Office of Communications (the "OC") to be located within an
existing Executive Branch agency.  

<P>        The OC will concentrate on the following tasks: (1) overseeing the
implementation of a transition from the current practice of universal service
based on hidden and elaborate cross-subsidies to a smaller, more efficient
and targeted needs -- based system; (2) overseeing the mass privatization of
 spectrum to the American people through a sequenced, phased-in  auction
process; (3) coordinating a non-interference standard to govern the private
sector's use of spectrum; and (4) coordinating U.S. international commitments
and opportunities for telecommunications. Supporting the new, more focused
 governmental role will be an emphasis on traditional antitrust enforcement
utilizing existing expertise and personnel located within the U.S. Department
of Justice. 

<P>        The Replacement Model offers a detailed and  specific action plan for the
transition to a the new, modern government.  Existing statutes, rules and
regulations are either eliminated immediately, subject to a three year sunset
provision, or retained and re-assigned to the Replacement Model's Office of
Communications.  At the end of the sunset period, those rules and regulations
deemed necessary by the OC to promote economic welfare through competition
will be retained only by affirmative action of Congress.

<P>        Part One of this report establishes the case for replacing and modernizing
the existing regulatory regime. The focus is on the systemic influence of
 regulations and statutes which authorize the <A HREF="http://www.fcc.gov/">Federal Communications
Commission</A> ("FCC") and have inflicted staggering costs upon American
consumers and the economy.  The report recognizes that other restrictions
arising from federal/state mechanisms such as the Modified Final Judgment
("MFJ")  settlement also have had an impact on competition.  

<P>        The systemic problem, however, remains that the statutes, rules and
regulations underlying the FCC have denied through intrusive regulation the
U.S. economy tens of billions of dollars in annual growth. Current public
servants may be dedicated and hard working.  It is the system itself which in
some measure mandates that the FCC engage in certain practices and procedures
which block new products and services such as cable TV, microwave, cellular,
voice mail, video dialtone and new personal communications services. For
decades these technologies have been denied Americans while the FCC struggled
to decide what to allow to the consumer.  Price competition has been stymied
and business costs ultimately borne by the American public have been
needlessly inflated by a plethora of entry, ownership and contractual
regulations of telephone and media markets. Part One details the history of
this structural obstruction of technology and competition.

<P>        Resolving the economic imbalances imposed by universal service is a key
ingredient to any meaningful reform proposal.  Basic dialtone telephone
service for those truly in need is an essential element to a sustainable
modernization of government's role.  Part Two offers two approaches to
providing basic service for those truly in need.  The approaches make the
actual price of phone service open and clear to the American people.
 Currently, a hidden tax is imposed on all through various subsidies.  Urban
users subsidize rural users. Business and long-distance rates subsidize
residential rates. Much of the money is paid to companies, not consumers.
 Many of the well-to-do get subsidized.  The current system imposes burdens
on those allegedly it seeks to help -- those financially less well off.  An
urban, single parent family on government assistance programs today actually
subsidizes the phone bills of  rural users -- even if the rural user calls
from a ski chalet or vacation home  straight out of  Lifestyles of the Rich
and Famous.

<P>         Moreover, no one knows what the subsidies cost despite the billions of
dollars in the system because the lack of accountability destroys incentives
to economize.  Like a Soviet-era good under Gosplan, no one really pays the
true cost of the phone services they use.  The replacement model puts a halt
to this muddle.  

<P>        The model supports the claimed purpose of cross-subsidization, promotion of
so-called "universal service," but in ways that are more accountable,
explicit and efficient.  Both plans recognize a national  interest in keeping
basic phone service affordable to all Americans.  The first model has three
facets.  First, the federal program to keep residential telephone rates
affordable in high cost areas would be limited to that amount needed on a
going forward basis to provide wireline service to those areas.  Second, the
model embraces use of  a specific, targeted means test to provide assistance
to those truly in need.  Third, the responsibility for the remainder of the
universal service subsidies paid by interstate long distance callers would
devolve to the state level subject to broad federal guidelines.  Restoration
of market prices and efficient pricing will foster real competition and
result in substantially lower prices.

<P>        The second approach proposes that the responsibility for maintaining
universal service be transferred to the states.   Those local exchange costs
that are now allocated to the interstate jurisdiction are returned to the
respective states.  Each state could recover those costs as deemed fit,
subject to federal guidelines.  Under this model, federal law would  pre-empt
entry restrictions and prohibit discriminatory treatment of interstate users
for comparable services. 

<P>        Both approaches are subject to strict federal guidelines forbidding price
discrimination and requiring interconnection for all competitors.  Moreover,
the Replacement Model continues the federal pre-emption of state regulation
of wireless services.

<P>        In Part Three, the Replacement Model promotes American competitiveness
through a modern approach to use of  the spectrum. Spectrum is transferred to
private hands in a sequenced,  phased-in approach.  In Phase One, those with
current licenses in spectrum are granted title to the spectrum currently
used.  These owners of spectrum , the vast majority of whom have already
purchased their stations, will be free to use, transfer and develop spectrum
as they deem necessary.   Property rights in spectrum will be enforced
through traditional legal protections afforded all property owners in the
courts. Under this approach, industry would also have recourse to the OC for
interference issues and use of laboratories for testing and evaluation of new
equipment and technologies.

<P>        In Phase Two, applications pending before the FCC as of May 1, 1995,  would
be granted title to the spectrum on an expedited basis.  In addition, the OC
will on an expedited basis, begin to roll-out non-allocated spectrum for the
presumptive use by private sector entities seeking its use.  Competing bids for the
spectrum will be subject to expedited auction.  This bottom-up, demand-driven
process will allow market forces to determine spectrum use and jump start
competition and technological innovation.  

<P>        In Phase Three, the government will begin the process of turning over its
spectrum to the private sector by beginning an expedited survey of available
spectrum bands, establishing standardized parcels for entrants to claim.  The
government currently presides over massive amounts of under-utilized spectrum
far in excess of its needs for possible use by the <A HREF="http://www.dtic.dla.mil/defenselink/index.html">Department of Defense</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</A>, etc. 

<P>        In Phase Four, the government will  permit claimants to claim title to
available spectrum as identified in the spectrum survey. In the event that
there are multiple claimants for a particular parcel of spectrum, an auction
will be held.  Each department making the spectrum available that is subject
to an auction will retain a portion of auction proceeds for modernization to
more efficient digital equipment, re-location expenses and for current
operations.  Remaining auction proceeds can be dedicated to deficit
reduction.

<P>        The premise again is that spectrum use will be dictated by the American
people, not the government.  The Replacement Model envisions a governmental
role for coordinating "spectrum contours," "overlay rights" and "band
management rights" but mandates that these rights be defined quickly and made
available for private investors willing to risk capital in developing new
wireless services.  The key is to sell title in property, not mere licenses.
 Those who claim unchallenged use of identified parcels or bid and win title
to spectrum are free to develop and/or re-sell the spectrum as with any other
private property right subject to antitrust review and the geographic and
interference boundaries of property assignments.  The primary goal of these
spectrum reforms is the rapid and efficient creation of a spectrum market and
to provide an economic stimulus in job creation.  Recent announcements by the
government confirmed that auctioning spectrum can also have a supplemental
benefit of raising billions in revenue for deficit reduction.

<P>        Finally, Part Four sets out a detailed and specific plan for implementing
the Replacement Model's recommendations.   It re-assigns and re-organizes the
functions now performed by the FCC.  The goal is to focus on the critical
tasks for today and the future.  Government unquestionably should fulfill
some functions and services for the benefit of all Americans.  Others should
be eliminated immediately. A third residual category of FCC rules and
regulations would be sunsetted in three years.

<P>         The Replacement Model updates government to account for the differences
between the analog past and the technologies now emerging through market
forces.  For sixty years, the government substituted administrative,
bureaucratic decision-making for the free market.  Two old, major assumptions
-- (1) the existence of a "natural monopoly" in telecommunications; and (2)
the assumption that technology would remain essentially static or unchanging
-- are untenable for the 21st century.  The model makes a clear break with
the past, embracing competition with antitrust enforcement and by
transferring authority to the states in those instances when monopoly
regulation remains temporarily necessary. The new role for government is
leaner, more cost effective and serves the American people.   This, then,  is
a call to action to meet the challenges of the telecommunications revolution
-- an American opportunity.

<p>
<a  name="intro"></a><b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>

	As part of congressional budget reconciliation, the House Agriculture Committee considered the Freedom to Farm Act (H.R. 2195) on September 20. This legislation, sponsored by Committee Chairman Pat Roberts (R-KS), would significantly change the wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice programs. Before the legislation was considered in committee, Roberts also incorporated serious reform of the dairy program into the Act. With certain modifications, the proposal represents serious reform of America's obsolete farm programs.1<p>	Unfortunately, Chairman Roberts' attempt to provide a beginning for real reform suffered a setback when entrenched special interests, led by the National Cotton Council, succeeded in lining up a majority of the committee to vote against his bill. Nevertheless, the possibility for real reform is not yet dead, because the proposal may be considered again later this week, either by a reconvened House Agriculture Committee or by the House Budget Committee. Because a majority of the members of the House Agriculture Committee already have demonstrated their hostility to reform, the prospects for success appear better in the House Budget Committee.

<p>	Later this week, the Senate Agriculture Committee also will address budget reconciliation, and Chairman Richard Lugar (R-IN), who has been an advocate of fundamental reform, may propose incorporation of a number of provisions drawn from the Freedom to Farm Act. Unlike the House, the Senate Agriculture Committee must resist the pressure of entrenched special interests and support the end of farm welfare.
<p>
	While the Freedom to Farm Act proposes reform for some programs, other important programs are overlooked. The Act does not include reform of either the sugar or peanut programs, even though these programs also face reauthorization this year and must be addressed, either in budget reconciliation or in the 1995 farm bill. Their anti-competitive and tightly controlled production systems limit the supply of these commodities while insulating these industries from the demands of the market. Removing supply restrictions will allow these industries to respond more effectively to new market opportunities and contribute to the nation's economic growth.2
<p>
	In July, during consideration of the House agriculture appropriations bill, Chairman Roberts promised reform-minded Members that they would have an opportunity to offer amendments to reform the sugar and peanut programs during floor consideration of the farm bill. These promises, and the argument that Members should wait for the farm bill to offer amendments that change agricultural policy, succeeded temporarily in slowing the drive for reform. But whether these programs are dealt with in the farm bill or in reconciliation, any proposals considered must represent real reform.
<p>
	The Agriculture Committees must not take the politically convenient course and adopt policies that preserve the anti-competitive aspects of the sugar and peanut programs. While the budget reconciliation instructions might provide the impetus for them to accept some sort of phase-down or phase-out of the more expensive commodity programs for wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice, there is no similar pressure to reform the sugar, peanut, and dairy programs. These programs are different because wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice are supported through subsidies based on what is produced. This amounts to a direct transfer of funds from taxpayers to producers. In no-net-cost programs, however, the commodity is supported through tightly limited production. This amounts to a transfer of funds from consumers to producers at little or no cost to the Treasury. Nevertheless, no-net-cost programs still impose significant economic costs on the nation.
<P>
<a href="#contents">Back to Contents</a>
<p>
<a name="sugar"></a><b>REFORMING THE SUGAR PROGRAM</b>
<P>
	The current sugar program operates as a cartel in which a handful of wealthy processors determine who has the right to produce sugar in this country. Production is supported by loans of 18 cents per pound for raw cane and refined beet sugar, an amount determined by a formula that supposedly reflects the relative difference in producer returns for sugar beets and sugarcane. The result is a U.S. price nearly twice as high as the world price. The law requires that this program be operated at "no-net-cost" to the government, which means prices must be maintained at levels high enough to avoid forfeiture to the government. To assure this, the government imposes import quotas and a system of domestic marketing allotments to limit the amount of sugar processed for domestic use. While the amount of sugar refined may exceed the marketing allotment, it may not be sold in the United States. This further stifles domestic production.
<P>
	Because there is no cost to the taxpayers,3 defenders of the sugar program argue that it should be preserved. However, this program -- which controls sugar prices, limits imports to keep the prices high, and then dictates how much domestically produced sugar can be sold -- does impose a cost of $1.4 billion annually on U.S. consumers,4 who are forced to pay it through higher prices for products containing sugar. Moreover, consumers are not the only ones hurt. Because of its excessive subsidies, the program has forced a number of refineries that process raw sugar to close, eliminating domestic jobs and displacing workers.
<P>
	There have been discussions within certain segments of the sugar refining industry and among Agriculture Committee members about offering an alternative to the current sugar program that would reduce the support price from 18 cents per pound to 14 cents in the 1996 crop year, 13 cents in the 1997 crop year, and 12 cents in the 1998 crop year. Thus, the support price would have a floor of 12 cents per pound even though the world price is now at about 11 cents per pound and frequently has been much lower. This proposal also would terminate the sugar marketing quota and allotment program, but without making the sugar industry responsive to the world market price. It therefore fails to correct the problems of the current system.
<P>
	The sugar program is big government and corporate welfare at their worst. Almost half of its $1.4 billion in benefits goes to one percent of sugar growers. In fact, 33 growers and corporations each receive more than $1 million per year, and one Florida family received more than $65 million in one year alone.5
<P>
	The Sugar Reform Act of 1995 (H.R. 1687), introduced by Representatives Dan Miller (R-FL) and Charles Schumer (D-NY), and a Senate companion bill (S. 847) introduced by Senators Judd Gregg (R-NH), Harry Reid (D-NV), and Bill Bradley (D-NJ) represent real reform that would benefit both farmers and consumers. Both the support price and the domestic marketing allotments would be eliminated immediately, allowing farmers to produce sugar to meet the demands of a free market. Unfortunately, all proposals introduced so far maintain existing import restrictions which artificially raise domestic prices for consumers. If the sugar program was eliminated, a market-oriented and internationally competitive policy would provide both reasonable sweetener prices and adequate supplies.

<a name="peanut"></a><b>REFORMING THE PEANUT PROGRAM</b>
<P>
	Incredibly, the peanut program actually restricts the right of Americans to produce peanuts. By establishing a quota system, it gives a limited few the exclusive right, based on inheritance or purchase, to produce peanuts in the United States for the U.S. market at a guaranteed high level of price support. These "quota" peanuts are supported at a much higher price ($678 per ton) than non-quota or "additional" peanuts, which are supported at $132 per ton. Only quota peanuts can be marketed in the U.S., while non-quota peanuts must be exported, sold to a processor responsible for exporting them, or sold to the government. To protect holders of peanut quotas even more from the effects of competition, peanut imports also are severely restricted. 
<P>
	 The peanut program is unfair not only to any farmer that would like to grow peanuts but cannot obtain a license, but also to those who succeed in buying or renting the right to produce peanuts. Two-thirds of those who own peanut growing licenses are not farmers, so farmers often must rent licenses from others. In fact, this usually is the most significant cost of producing peanuts. Although the cost of this program to taxpayers has been growing in recent years, the greatest cost falls on consumers who -- again -- are forced to pay higher prices.
<P>
	Proponents of maintaining the status quo are not concerned with the cost to consumers. They want to make the peanut program into another "no-net cost" program in the hope of preventing radical change. One way to do this is by merely reducing the support for quota peanuts from $678 a ton to $600 or $550 a ton. But while this approach might reduce the cost to taxpayers temporarily, based on current market prices, there is no assurance that costs would remain limited in the longer term. Nor would there be any expected reduction in the $300 million the program annually costs consumers; if world prices drop, the cost of the domestic program will increase.
<p>
	The only way to be sure that there is no cost while retaining the present structure is to restrict production further by reducing the amount of quota peanuts that can be produced. But, such a regressive action would penalize domestic consumers even more while reinforcing the barriers to entry in growing peanuts. Defenders of the status quo also have suggested that reducing the amount of quota peanuts -- in other words, reduce the supply to inflate the price -- could reduce the cost of the program.
<P>
	Such "reform" proposals are nothing but a hoax. The peanut program, like the sugar program, is beyond repair and no amount of tinkering can improve it. The only genuine reform of the peanut program is contained in the Peanut Reform Act of 1995 (H.R. 2008), introduced by Representatives Christopher Shays (R-CT) and Andrew Jacobs (D-IN), and the companion Senate bill (S. 1027) introduced by Senators Hank Brown (R-CO) and Bill Bradley. These proposals would eliminate the program immediately. In addition, Senators Rick Santorum (R-PA) and Richard Lugar have introduced S. 1188, which would phase out the quota system by the year 2000. Ending the quota and allotment systems will benefit farmers directly by removing one of the most significant costs of production -- rental of quotas -- and ending the discrimination against U.S.-grown non-quota peanuts. Eliminating the unproductive overhead costs will increase the share of consumer expenditures returned to the producer while, at the same time, increased domestic production of lower-cost peanuts will benefit the American consumer directly.

<a name="dairy"></a><b>REFORMING THE DAIRY PROGRAM</b>
<p>

	The dairy program guarantees that the federal government will purchase, at an established price, unlimited quantities of surplus cheese, butter, and dried milk. The law provides a mechanism by which the guaranteed purchase price can be lowered or raised, depending upon whether the government's purchases are expected to exceed or fall short of a preestablished level. Under no circumstance, however, can the support price drop below a floor price of $10.10 per hundred pounds of milk.
<P>
	When government guarantees that it will purchase any surplus production that cannot be sold in the marketplace, producers have no incentive to compete against each other. Thus, incentives for efficiency and innovation also disappear. Processors have no incentive to take the risks necessary to develop new products demanded by American and foreign consumers, so the industry is sluggish and unresponsive to the ever-changing demands of both domestic and international markets. 
<p>
	In addition, the nation's milk supply is regulated by an unbelievably complex and archaic system of federal milk marketing orders. Ostensibly designed to assure adequate supplies in all regions of the country, these marketing orders restrict the sale of milk between different regions. These pricing policies tend to raise the effective support price in high-cost regions of the country, encouraging farmers to increase production instead of permitting fluid milk to be shipped in profitably from lower cost regions. It is estimated that milk marketing orders cost consumers between $621 million and $851 billion in 1985 (in 1995 dollars, from $839 million to $1.15 billion).6  The program has hindered the U.S. dairy industry's ability to take advantage of the export market. There should be no restrictions on where milk is sold or marketed and no government attempts to manipulate interstate commerce in dairy products.
<p>
	However, the industry's reform proposal would make the situation even worse. The National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF) has outlined a proposal that would eliminate price supports for butter and powder. But it would retain price support for cheese, require the Secretary of Agriculture to buy about 2.4 billion pounds of dairy products, and mandate an increase in price supports, thereby further pushing up prices. By keeping the support price on cheese and requiring additional payments when lower world market-priced butter is used to produce other U.S. products, this proposal would insulate American dairy producers from the impact of eliminating price supports on butter and powder.
<p>
	In effect, this proposal would establish a two-tiered pricing system with a lower export price on butter and nonfat dry milk and a higher domestic price on fluid milk and cheese. U.S. manufacturers of products which use nonfat dried milk would be required to pay a higher price for that ingredient than would foreign manufacturers using the same U.S. product. This amounts to imposing a "powder tax" on domestic manufacturers.
<p>
	The expectation is that decoupling nonfat dry milk and butter from support prices would cause prices for these commodities to fall to world market levels and become competitive in international trade. However, requiring a higher price on nonfat dry milk and butter used as a domestic food ingredient would lead to a two-tier system for nonfat dry milk, with a higher price for domestic purposes than for international purposes. Ice cream, cheese, or confectionery manufacturers and bakers in the U.S. would be required to pay more for nonfat dry milk used to produce their products than would manufacturers in other countries using U.S.-made nonfat dry milk.
<p>
	Such a two-tiered pricing system not only would violate the GATT agreement, but also would make it virtually impossible for U.S. manufacturers of value-added products to compete in the world market. This will discourage expansion of that increasingly important potential export market while providing even more barriers to entry for those who are not in the industry at the present time, further limiting growth in the domestic market where 98 percent of U.S. production is consumed.
<P>
	The NMPF proposal also includes consolidating the 40 or so existing milk marketing orders into 8 to 12 market order areas. There have been other suggestions that existing federal and state milk market orders be consolidated into a single national order for all milk produced in the United States, thereby dramatically increasing the federal government's control over the marketing of milk. But consolidating milk marketing orders does nothing to reduce the federal government's involvement in and regulation of the dairy industry. In fact, mere consolidation will make the already unresponsive pricing system even less responsive to market forces.
<P>
	Two recent proposals represent real reform. For a time, there was only the Dairy Freedom Act introduced by Representative Thomas Petri (R-WI), which would end the trade-restrictive marketing orders on January 1, 1996, and phase out the dairy support program over five years. More recently, however, Chairman Roberts has incorporated a dairy reform proposal by Representative Steve Gunderson (R-WI), Chairman of the Dairy Subcommittee. Similar to what Chairman Roberts has proposed for wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice in the Freedom to Farm Act, Gunderson's proposal would eliminate the milk marketing orders' pricing and regulatory functions on July 1, 1996, and end the price support program on January 1, 1996, replacing it with transition payments to be made over the next seven years.

<a name="concl"></a><b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>
	If the House and Senate Agriculture Committee Chairmen can overcome the entrenched special interests standing in the way of reform and report the Freedom to Farm Act out of their respective committees, their committees will be making history by setting the wheat, feed grain, cotton, and rice programs on the path to reform. However, the true test of sweeping, fundamental reform will come when Congress decides what to do with the sugar, peanut, and dairy programs. Incremental changes are not enough. Congress needs to adopt real reform of these programs:  either outright elimination or reform comparable to what both Chairmen have proposed for the wheat, feed grain, cotton, and rice programs. By doing so, Congress will benefit farmers and signal clearly to the rest of the world that the United States intends to pursue an aggressively pro-growth agricultural policy into the 21st century.7<p><b>Endnotes:</b><ol><li>For a complete discussion of changes needed to improve the Freedom to Farm Act, see John E.

<h2>ADVANCING MEDICAL INNOVATION:</h2>
<P>
<B>Health, Safety and the Role of Government in the 21st Century</B>
<P>
<B>Executive Summary</B>
<P>
by 
Ralph A. Epstein, M.D., Thomas M. Lenard, Ph.D, Henry I. Miller, M.D., Robert D. Tollison, Ph.D., W. Kip Viscusi, Ph.D., William M. Wardell, M.D., Ph.D.
<P>
As Americans enter the 21st Century, we are poised to see tremendous
breakthroughs in medical technology - from genetic engineering
to surgical lasers to molecular transports.  Yet patients may
be denied these advances because the process for allowing new
medical products on the market is cumbersome, slow, expensive
and inefficient.  In order for Americans to have the latest technology
to improve their health - or even to survive - the Food and Drug
Administration - a prototypical centralized, bureaucratic regulatory
agency - must be reformed for the 21st Century.
<P>
While reforms have been tried in the past, they failed to significantly
improve the speed with which patients have access to new  products;
failed reforms have been too marginal to make an impact.  Therefore,
the following plan calls for a completely new framework for approving
drugs and medical devices.  Its goal is simple:  the regulatory
process should be designed to block dangerous or ineffective products
while also speeding safe and effective ones to the clinic.  While
such a system will have a great impact on stopping the flight
of our medical companies overseas and maintaining American global
competitiveness, its fundamental benefit will be to save lives
and increase the quality of life for Americans.
<P>
Currently the FDA has a statutory monopoly on new product approvals.
 This monopoly eliminates any institutional check on the regulatory
creep that inexorably has added time, costs and unpredictability
to the review process.  These effects have stifled the development
and introduction of new technologies to patients.  As long as
the only route to market is through the FDA, adverse trends in
product availability will continue.
<P>
Therefore, our plan opens the product certification process to
competitive forces.  It is not a complete laissez faire approach
with no government oversight, because Americans want a required
independent review to ensure safety and effectiveness.  While
maintaining the existing legal requirements for pre-market demonstration
of safety and effectiveness, as well as the FDA stamp of apporval,
the plan relies on nongovernmental bodies - called Drug or Device
Certification Bodies - to review and certify new products.
<P>
The competition among the DCBs for clients will encourage them
to offer the greatest expertise and reputation for integrity,
to identify and solve problems early and rapidly, to perform reviews
in a timely manner, and to manage the oversight and review efficiently.
 The FDA's primary function will be to certify the quality of
the certifiers, not to actually be a certifier of products.  The
FDA retains authority to issue the final sign-off approval for
product marketing, but with a new appeal procedure in the event
of disagreement with a company and/or DCB.  Also, the FDA retains
a powerful post-marketing  system for monitoring the safety of
products.
<P>
Specific highlights of the plan are as follows:
<P>
<B>DRUGS AND BIOLOGICS</B>
<P>
 
<UL>
<LI>For drugs and biologics, the primary responsibility for managing
the Investigational New Drug filing, oversight of the clinical
program, and New Drug Application/Product License Application
review will be transferred from the FDA to nongovernmental Drug
Certification Bodies (DCBs).  The DCBs, which can be profit-making
or non-profit organizations, will be subject to FDA certification
and staffed - as required by the language of the Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act - by the necessary &quot;experts qualified by scientific
training and experience.&quot;  
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The sponsor will submit New Drug Applications/Product License
Applications to the DCB, not to FDA.  After evaluating the application,
the DCB will submit a summary of the results of its review (if
favorable) to FDA.  The FDA Commissioner then has a designated
period of time to accept the DCB's recommendation for approval
(which, legally, is a &quot;rebuttable presumption&quot;) or to
deny approval.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
<B>MEDICAL DEVICES</B>
<UL>
<LI>Manufacturers generally will have a choice of methods by which
to get a product approved for market, by either demonstrating
conformance of its<I> quality assurance systems</I> or conformance
of the <I>product</I> itself.  Such a system is modeled on the
European Union's medical device regulatory system, which is characterized
by reliance on clear and objective standards that are largely
implemented by private, nongovernmental organizations.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>For all classes of devices except Class I (the least risky),
a DCB must audit the manufacturer periodically to confirm conformance
with the necessary standards.  The FDA's current auditing of manufacturers
for Good Manufacturing Practices will be replaced by the DCB's
certification of the manufacturer's quality assurance systems.
 Such certification will often exceed FDA standards as it could
include certification of design quality assurance.  It will also
be performed far more frequently than current FDA inspections.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Class III products (the riskiest products) will require premarketing
<I>design approval</I> by a DCB.  Although not part of the EU
system, the plan also requires the FDA to be notified 90 days
prior to marketing a Class III product, to allow time for the
FDA to elect to review the appropriateness of the certification
process.
</UL>

<P>
<B>APPEALS</B>
<P>
<ul>
Our plan establishes an independent, standing committee of experts
within the Department of Health and Human Services - the Medical
Review Board (MRB) - to advise the Secretary when the FDA disagrees
with a DCB's product approval recommendation.  The MRB will have
approximately 10 to 15 members representing a wide spectrum of
scientific, medical and regulatory expertise.  It will hear appeals
of FDA decisions to overturn a DCB recommendation, and will advise
the HHS Secretary.  All parties, including FDA, will be expected
to accept the decision of the Secretary.
</ul><P>
<B>LIABILITY</B>
<P>
<ul>
The plan includes a regulatory compliance defense for all product
liability, not simply a defense against punitive damages.<B> 
</B>The regulatory compliance defense recognizes that, by negotiating
the regulatory process, the manufacturer has fulfilled its requirements
with respect to the provision of products that provide an appropriate
level of safety, and that the government has certified this fact.
 Lawyers and courts should not be second guessing decisions regarding
product safety that have already been recognized by government
agencies as having achieved appropriate levels of safety.  Our
plan for replacing the FDA drug and device approval processes
would not limit the applicability of this defense, because there
would continue to be a regulatory mechanism to ensure that an
appropriate level of product safety is provided to consumers.
<P>
Of course DCBs will be subject to tort liability for negligence
in carrying out their obligations. Our plan recommends formalizing
the current recognition by the courts that such certification
bodies not be subject to strict liability to third parties injured
by products.
</ul>
<P>
<B>INTERNATIONAL HARMONIZATION</B>
<P>
<ul>
Our plan recommends that products approved in jurisdictions whose
standards are similar to those in the United States - for example,
Great Britain or the European Union - have the same status as
a product certified by a DCB.  Where applicable (i.e., for drugs
and Class III devices), products with foreign approvals could
be submitted to the FDA for U.S. marketing approval under the
same procedures and with the same rebuttable presumptions as a
DCB-approved product.

<P>
In its current form, the Food and Drug Administration is a prototypical
centralized, bureaucratic regulatory agency, similar to so many
other agencies designed during the heyday of the Progressive era.
 By modern standards, it is cumbersome, slow, expensive and inefficient.
 But its most significant costs are not financial - they are human.
 America's outmoded FDA directly results in jobs being exported
overseas.  And, most importantly, it denies new health technologies
to patients who need them to live healthy lives, or even to survive.
<BR>

<P>
The Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation has undertaken a multi-year
effort to design and to create a new, modern institution that
will continue to ensure the safety and effectiveness of medical
products while providing patients with faster access to new treatments.
 Two earlier versions of a replacement model for the FDA were
circulated to the public with request for comment.  In addition,
the Advisory Committee, under the chairmanship of Dr. Louis Sullivan,
provided valuable guidance.  The views expressed here-in are solely

<FONT >The Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation began
its work developing a replacement model for medical technology
regulation in 1993, believing that the coming advances in medical

a regulatory process was in place that encouraged rather than
stifled innovation.<BR>

<h2>INTRODUCTION </h2>
<P>
<FONT >The United States leads the world in the discovery
of the new drugs, biologics and medical devices that offer the
promise of longer and healthier lives for our citizens.  But the
process of actually developing these products and getting them
approved for marketing has become increasingly lengthy, expensive
and complex.  The past several decades have seen breathtaking
scientific breakthroughs in areas such as biotechnology and computing.
 But these breakthroughs have yet to be translated in a significant
way into new medical products that benefit patients.  Regulatory
demands and delays are not the only reasons for this stagnation,
but they are significant factors.  America's regulatory procedures
are among the slowest and most expensive in the developed world,
and it is now common for U.S. companies to conduct product testing
and development abroad and for new drugs and devices to be available
first in other countries.  Consider the following:</FONT>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><FONT >The time required to bring a new drug to
market in the United States, from chemical synthesis to marketing,
has increased steadily, from slightly more than six years in the
mid-1960s to almost 15 years currently<sup><a href="foot.html">1</a></sup>.</FONT>
<LI><FONT >The percentage of drugs first available
in the United States is low.  Seventy-three percent of drugs approved
by the FDA during 1987-93 had already been approved elsewhere.
 In the area of anticancer agents, for example, the United States
once led the world and now lags behind other nations.  During
the 1960s, cancer patients in the United States had more anticancer
agents available to them than did patients in Great Britain, Germany,
France or Japan.  Now, in contrast, patients in the United States
have fewer anticancer agents available than those in any of these
countries.<sup><a href="foot.html">2</a></sup></FONT>
<LI><FONT >In the medical device area, a product that
takes four years to bring to market in Europe frequently requires
six years in the United States<sup><a href="foot.html">3</a></sup>.  As a result, medical device manufacturers
in large numbers are first introducing their products offshore,
and American patients increasingly are receiving therapies that
are a generation or more behind those available in Europe.</FONT>
</UL>

<P>
<FONT > </FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Reversing these trends will require a fundamental
change in the framework used to bring new medical products to
the market.  Many studies have been performed and expert groups
convened with the goal of reforming drug and device oversight.
 But, they have failed to yield significant improvement in the
only meaningful bottom line:  total development times and product
availability.  Those reforms that have been adopted have been
too marginal to have an appreciable overall impact on improving
the system.  (Recent evidence may suggest that marketing approvals
recently have become slightly more expeditious, but no impact
has been seen on the overall time and cost of development).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Therefore, we propose a revised framework for
approving drugs and medical devices that does not alter the basic
objectives underlying the existing system:  that medical products
are evaluated by qualified experts on the basis of adequate data;
that they meet appropriate standards, defined in terms of the
relationship between benefits and risks; and, that they perform
as claimed on the label.  The regulatory process should be designed
to block dangerous or ineffective products; but, it should also
speed salubrious ones to the clinic.  The existing review and
approval procedures have achieved some success at ensuring that
products admitted to the market are reasonably safe and effective.
 But this benefit has been achieved at great direct and indirect
cost to patients, industry and government, with the introduction
of many promising new therapies delayed or prevented entirely.
 Much of this cost is unnecessary:  safety and effectiveness do
not have to be sacrificed by the introduction of greater regulatory
efficiency.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >A NEW INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has
a statutory mandate to assure that new drugs and devices are safe
and effective.  This mandate is combined with a &quot;monopoly&quot;
on new product approvals.  It is the monopoly part of this framework
that is the principal source of current deficiencies in drug and
device oversight, because there is no institutional check on the
regulatory creep that inexorably has added time, costs, and unpredictability
to the review process.  In fact, the FDA has raised the regulatory
burden on product sponsors by continually introducing new requirements
and policies without regard for their negative impact on the delivery
of new and innovative therapies to patients.  As long as the only
route to the market is through the FDA, the adverse trends in
product availability and development times are likely to continue.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Improving the balance of incentives, therefore,
requires opening the product certification process to competitive
forces.  If one extreme of the &quot;institutional spectrum&quot;
is represented by the current FDA monopoly, the other pole is
represented by complete laissez faire, under which decisions to
market drugs and devices would be made by manufacturers without
government regulatory oversight.  In theory, manufacturers would
still be constrained, by the desire to maintain the reputation
of their products and avoid litigation.  But our proposal rejects
this alternative.  Although a laissez-faire system may have some
merits, particularly for established firms with reputations to
protect, it may also provide firms with an incentive to take unwarranted
risks.  Moreover, most American consumers want a required independent
review to ensure safety and effectiveness.  For these and other
reasons, laissez faire is not a viable option for bringing new
medical products to the market in the United States.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The plan proposal, described here, maintains
existing or equivalent government standards and oversight, as
well as the FDA stamp of approval, signifying that benefits and
risks have been evaluated and balanced appropriately.  At the
same time, the proposal relies on nongovernmental bodies for review
and certification.  In this model, <I>the FDA is primarily a certifier
of certifiers, rather than a certifier of products.</I>  The element
of competition among the nongovernmental certifying bodies for
sponsors' business is an important element of the proposal.  By
providing product sponsors with choice among certifying bodies,
but retaining high product standards, the system institutes a
review process that is responsive to the needs of patients and
product development.<BR>

<h3><FONT >DRUGS AND BIOLOGICS</FONT></h3>
<P>
<FONT >The goal of the proposal is to speed the delivery
of safe and effective new drugs and biologics to patients who
need them.  To achieve this goal requires changes in the regulatory
system that will facilitate early clinical research, increase
the efficiency of drug development and its regulatory oversight,
and reduce the overall time and cost required for a new drug to
reach the market. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >There has been broad consensus for nearly three
decades that reforms of the current system are necessary.  Numerous
official panels and inquiries have proposed remedies, but they
have not been implemented expeditiously or widely.  The present
proposal embodies the most important and consistently repeated
of these recommendations:  management and structural reforms that
transfer tasks currently performed internally by FDA to outside
experts and organizations.  While FDA has at one time or another
delegated most of its review and evaluation functions to outside
experts or entities, this delegation has been piecemeal and disorganized;
partial privatization has never been integrated in a way that
could create an efficient overall system.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Other reforms recommended repeatedly by blue
ribbon panels have included a lesser role for FDA in the scrutiny
of early-phase clinical investigations and the wider use of accelerated
approvals coupled with continued post-market surveillance.  The
proposal adopts these recommendations, explicitly or implicitly.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The proposal rationalizes and enhances the
efficiency of the process for developing, reviewing and approving
new drugs and biologics by assigning principal review responsibilities
to government-certified <I>Drug Certification Bodies</I> (DCBs).
 At the same time, <I>the proposal maintains the existing legal
requirement for pre-market demonstration of safety and effectiveness</I>.
 Preserved as well are FDA's oversight, enforcement powers and
the agency's authority to issue the final sign-off approval for
product marketing.  Key elements in the process are outlined below
and in Figure 1.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>

<UL>
<LI><FONT >The primary responsibility for managing
the Investigational New Drug (IND) filing, oversight of the clinical
program, and New Drug Application (NDA)/Product License Application
(PLA) review will be transferred from the FDA to nongovernmental
Drug Certification Bodies (DCBs).</FONT>
</UL>

<UL>
<LI><FONT >The DCBs, which can be profit-making or
non-profit organizations, will be subject to FDA certification
and staffed -- as required by the language of the Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act -- by the necessary &quot;experts qualified by
scientific training and experience.&quot;  </FONT>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI><FONT >The sponsor will submit NDAs (or PLAs)
to the DCB, not to FDA.  After evaluating the NDA, the DCB will
submit a summary of the results of its review (if favorable) to
FDA.  The FDA Commissioner then has a designated period of time
to accept the DCB's recommendation for approval (which, legally,
is a &quot;rebuttable presumption&quot;) or to deny approval.</FONT>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI><FONT >If approval is denied, then at the discretion
of the sponsor and the DCB, a review by an independent Medical
Review Board, reporting to the Secretary of Health and Human Services,
may be undertaken.  All parties, including the FDA, are expected
to accept the decision of the Secretary.</FONT>
</UL>
<UL>
<LI><FONT >FDA will continue to administer the present
national system of pharmacovigilance, above the level of the DCB.</FONT>
</UL>
<P>
<IMG SRC="IMG00001.GIF"><FONT >The plan reforms will
stimulate competition to supply drug-development oversight and
review services;  that is, DCBs will compete for sponsor-clients.
 This competition will encourage DCBs to identify and solve problems
early and rapidly, perform reviews in a timely manner, and manage
the oversight and review efficiently.  The system will favor DCBs
that offer the greatest expertise, the best service and a reputation
for integrity.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The crafting of drug development and approval
strategies will benefit from competitive pressures on DCBs, because
there is much room for innovation:  the choice of factors such
as clinical endpoints, indications for approval, and regimes of
pre-clinical and clinical testing, ultimately drives the size,
time and cost of development programs; and, there is large potential
for savings in these areas.  Subject to the law's standards of
effectiveness and safety, DCBs will be free - and competitive
pressures will encourage them - to devise new and more efficient
ways of developing drugs and meeting the approval standards. 
This strategic competition and synergy between sponsors and DCBs
will transform the drug development and approval process and will
reverse the relentless spiral of rising time and costs. <BR>

<h3>MEDICAL DEVICES</h3>
<P>
<FONT >The plan for medical devices will in large
part follow the European Union's medical device regulatory system,
which is characterized by reliance on clear and objective standards
that are largely implemented by private, non-governmental organizations.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Under the EU system, all medical devices are
classified, using objective criteria, into one of four classes
(I, IIa, IIb, and III) representing increasing levels of risk
and complexity.  Devices may be marketed only if they conform
with a comprehensive series of <I>essential requirements</I>.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >As is the case in the EU, implementation of
the proposed system will involve the interaction of three groups:
 manufacturers, who bear the ultimate responsibility for their
products; private Device Certifying Bodies (DCBs), engaged by
manufacturers to provide independent certification of critical
manufacturing processes and products; and, the federal authority
(FDA), which maintains responsibility for public safety by ensuring
the competence of the DCBs, enforcing compliance with law and
maintaining a universal system of postmarketing surveillance.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Review under the new system should be expeditious
because competitive forces will only tolerate DCBs that are responsive
to the market.  The current system has been characterized by such
slow approvals that important products are not available.  Domestically,
venture capital has become scarce and manufacturers have been
forced to relocate critical operations offshore.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Because device innovation is often characterized
by many small incremental changes, a method of rapid certification
of new products is needed in order for U.S. Manufacturers not
to fall further and further behind.  For Class I devices, the
new proposal permits manufacturers to self-certify conformance
with the essential requirements.  In addition, manufacturers who
maintain a total quality assurance system may self-certify new
Class IIa and IIb products between the periodic audits by their
DCB.  Key elements of the proposal are summarized  below and in
Figures 2 and 3.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >KEY PROPOSALS FOR DEVICES<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<UL>
<LI><FONT >Manufacturers can ensure conformance with
the essential requirements by adhering to relevant internationally
agreed upon objective standards.  The manufacturer generally will
have a choice of methods, and will be able to either demonstrate
conformance of its<I> quality assurance systems</I> or conformance
of the <I>product</I> itself.  Combinations of these two routes
are permitted. </FONT>
<LI><FONT >For all classes of devices except Class
I, a DCB must audit the manufacturer periodically to confirm such
conformance.  The stringency of the audit and the number of areas
audited depend on the class.  The FDA's current auditing of manufacturers
for Good Manufacturing Practices will be replaced by the DCB's
certification of the manufacturer's quality assurance systems.
 Such certification will often exceed FDA standards as it could
include certification of design quality assurance.  It will also
be performed far more frequently than current FDA inspections.</FONT>
<LI><FONT >Class III products always require premarketing
<I>design approval</I> by a DCB.  Although not part of the EU
system, the proposal presented here also requires the FDA to be
notified 90 days prior to marketing a Class III product, to allow
time for the FDA to elect to review the appropriateness of the
certification process.</FONT>
<LI><FONT >All manufacturers will be required to have
a system for monitoring and acting upon reports of a device malfunction
after sale.  In addition, the FDA will act as a central repository
of such information when it involves a threat to patient safety,
as it is in a position to monitor the investigation of such events,
especially when they involve similar situations arising with several
manufacturers.  The FDA may, for cause, require that a device
be withdrawn from the market if the manufacturer has not ensured
that it meets the essential requirements or if the DCB has not
acted competently.  In addition, criminal charges may be brought
in the case of fraud or criminal negligence.</FONT>

<FONT >Current FDA procedures do not provide an adequate

remedies this deficiency by establishing an independent, standing
committee of experts within Health and Human Services - the Medical

with a DCB's product approval recommendation.  The MRB will have
approximately 10- to-15 members representing a wide spectrum of
scientific, medical and regulatory expertise.  It will hear appeals
of FDA decisions to overturn a DCB recommendation, and will advise
the Secretary.  All parties, including FDA, will be expected to

and responsibly.  DCBs will be subject to FDA oversight and the
possibility of losing their certification if they do not follow
applicable regulatory guidelines.  They also will be subject to
tort liability for negligence in carrying out their obligations.
 Finally, DCBs will be subject to lawsuits from manufacturers
for breaking contractual obligations.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The DCBs should not, however, be liable for
factors beyond their control.  It is, therefore, important to
formalize the current recognition by the courts that such certification
bodies not be subject to strict liability to third parties injured
by products.  Otherwise, particularly in the context of joint
and several liability, many responsible institutions will be reluctant
to enter the certification market for fear that their very existence
will be threatened by tort liability suits that might be completely
unrelated to the manner in which they carried out their obligations.
 <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><B><FONT >Manufacturer Liability</FONT></B></I>
<P>
<FONT >Our plan also addresses the tort liability
status of pharmaceuticals and medical devices firms more generally.
 Liability costs have disproportionately burdened these industries,
largely because their products are intrinsically involved in life
and death situations.  In fact, major lines of litigation, such
as those involving DES and the Dalkon Shield, have come to be
almost synonymous with the liability crisis.  The potential liability
exposure faced by these industries has discouraged new product
innovation, particularly for products related to pregnancy and
childbirth.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >At the current time, there is insufficient
recognition by the courts of the extensive role played by government
regulation in ensuring efficient levels of safety for pharmaceuticals
and medical devices.  To the extent that the current FDA regulations
do achieve socially efficient control of risk, superimposing tort
liability in addition to regulation is harmful, by deterring introduction
of beneficial new products.  Therefore, the proposal includes
a regulatory compliance defense for all product liability, not
simply a defense against punitive damages.<B><sup><a href="foot.html">|</a></sup> <BR>
</B></FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The regulatory compliance defense simply recognizes
that, by negotiating the regulatory process, the manufacturer
has fulfilled its requirements with respect to the provision of
products that provide an appropriate level of safety, and that
the government has certified this fact.  Juries should not be
second guessing decisions regarding product safety that have already
been recognized by government agencies as having achieved appropriate
levels of safety.  The plan for reforming the FDA drug and device
approval processes would not limit the applicability of this defense,
because there would continue to be a regulatory mechanism to ensure
that an appropriate level of product safety is provided to consumers.
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >OFF-LABEL USE<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >The slowness of the FDA process for approving
new uses for products already on the market deprives patients
and their doctors of critically important information for long
periods of time - long after the scientific evidence is available
that a treatment may be beneficial for a particular condition.
 The proposal will make the &quot;off-label&quot; issue less salient,
by lowering the costs and increasing the benefits for manufacturers
who obtain supplementary approvals for their products.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Currently, the FDA does not give supplementary
applications a high priority and sponsors have a limited incentive
to submit them.  Under the proposed system, DCBs will have the
incentive and the resources to process supplementals efficiently
and in a timely manner.  Supplemental approvals for devices will
particularly be facilitated, because manufacturers with the requisite
quality assurance certification will be able to self-certify label
changes (subject to the usual monitoring by the DCB).  Another
major incentive to submit applications for supplemental approvals
will be provided by the regulatory compliance tort liability defense,
which will be available only to products used in approved ways.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >INTERNATIONAL HARMONIZATION<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >A major premise of the proposal is that the
current system for bringing drugs and medical devices to market
suffers because the FDA represents the only route to market. 
Therefore, permitting alternative routes is healthy for the entire
system, and one way to do this is to encourage &quot;jurisdictional
competition&quot; from foreign approval systems.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >This can most easily be done by permitting
products approved in jurisdictions whose standards are similar
to those in the United States - for example, the Great Britain
or the European Union - to have the same status as a product approved
by a DCB in the United States.  Where applicable (i.e., for drugs
and Class III devices), products with foreign approvals could
be submitted to the FDA for U.S. marketing approval under the
same procedures and with the same presumptive approvability as
a DCB-approved product.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Because it is based on standards and procedures
virtually identical to those of the European Union, adoption of
the proposed device system would, by itself,  substantially further
the goal of regulatory harmonization.  This system would make
it possible for a manufacturer to obtain both American and European
approval using the same documentation and inspections, and the
services of a single organization that could be certified both
as an American DCB and a European &quot;notified body.&quot; 
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >TRANSITION<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >A transition period of at least several years
will be needed to establish procedures to accredit DCBs and to
permit drugs and devices currently under review to be approved
under the existing system, if the manufacture should so elect.
 Once DCBs are available, any sponsor with an active application
before the FDA could withdraw that application and submit it to
a DCB.  At the end of the transition period, the FDA would cease
to perform review process functions.  Because of the European
Union device experience and the fact that (European) notified
bodies with U.S. affiliates and branches are already operational,
it is likely that the transition period for devices can be shorter
than for drugs. <BR>

<h2>I. Institutional Alternatives for the Regulation of Drugs and Medical Devices</h2>
by Robert D. Tollison
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >EXECUTIVE SUMMARY<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >This paper presents an economic and institutional
analysis of the various organizational alternatives which might
be adopted to reform the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 
The present FDA system is described as a government monopoly over
the introduction of new drugs and devices.  While this system
has served the public well in some respects, in recent years it
has proceeded with so much excessive caution against mistakes
that it has substantially slowed downed the introduction of beneficial
new drugs and devices. Thus the issue is, how can the present
system be reformed so as to speed up the introduction of beneficial
new products, while maintaining the existing legal standards of
safety and efficacy?<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >At one extreme from the present government
monopoly is <I>laissez faire,</I> meaning allowing private decisions
to be made by drug and device manufacturers with respect to the
marketing of their products.  Although this system has some merits,
it is generally found to be wanting in several respects due to
problems related to information and incentives in such an environment.
 For example, some firms may take unwarranted risks in the marketing
of new products where there is no government oversight.  Therefore
complete reliance on the goodwill and reputational capital of
firms is ruled out on such grounds.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Various other organizational arrangements involving
degrees of FDA oversight and degrees of privatization of the certification
process are considered here.  These include:  the removal of FDA
veto power over new products, a private monopoly organization
(laboratory) to review and certify new products subject to FDA
oversight, the contracting out to private entities of many of
the functions presently performed by the FDA, and competing private
firms as suppliers of certification services under FDA oversight.
 Indeed, the example of the Underwriters Laboratory as a private
certifier and standard-setter for a large variety of products
and commodities is discussed in some detail as an example of how
a private entity might work.  Also considered are issues of competing
jurisdictions and the international linkage of drug approval processes.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >All told, the analysis concludes that competing
private bodies under FDA oversight represent the best bet for
institutional reform.  In many respects, this system derives from
the &quot;European&quot; system presently in place for medical
devices.  The general point is that such a system offers the opportunity
for the United States to achieve greater benefits from the speedier
approval of beneficial new drugs and devices, while at the same
time maintaining the important legal standards for safety and
efficacy under the aegis of the FDA.  Moreover, allowing internationally
recognized drug review bodies in other countries, such as Great
Britain, to act as private entities in competition with U.S. private
entities would further insure that safe and effective products
would reach U.S. markets at the same time that they reach the
market in other advanced, industrial countries.<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT > Introduction<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >There are a variety of alternative institutional
arrangements which could be called upon to regulate and monitor
the safety and effectiveness of the nation's supply of new drugs
and medical devices. These range from the present system, which
can be classified as a government monopoly on drug and device
certification, to a free market system in which government would
have no regulatory role at all. In between these two extremes
are a number of institutional alternatives which combine more
or less government oversight with more or less private involvement.
 There are costs and benefits of each system, and it is through
a careful consideration of these costs and benefits that one can
proceed to choose a system that provides the most  net benefits
 to medical consumers. In this regard it should be acknowledged
that the present system of government monopoly, as embodied in
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and its accompanying legislation,
has undoubtedly provided substantial benefits over time to medical
consumers. This is not the issue. The point is to explore whether
the present process can be improved and strengthened so as to
continue to serve medical consumers into the next century. To
this end this paper examines the major institutional alternatives
for regulating drugs and medical devices, starting with the existing
system as presently administered by the FDA. <BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >Government Monopoly<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >The prevailing institutional arrangement under
which the FDA operates may be described as a government monopoly.
The oversight of new drugs, medical devices, and biologics is
centralized under FDA control. The hallmark of the FDA as a government
monopoly is the fact that producers have no alternative route
to the oversight of clinical research and the review and certification
of new drugs and devices other than through the FDA.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The existing literature on government monopoly
bureaus dates from William Niskanen's pioneering microanalytic
study of bureaucracy (Niskanen 1971). Niskanen modeled a bureau
as an agent which bargained with an oversight committee for funding.
Due to its comparative advantage in information, the bureau always
won in the bargaining process. Indeed, Niskanen postulated a theory
in which the bureau was in a position to win all-or-none bargains
with the oversight committee, thereby expanding its budgetary
base or policy mandate well beyond the &quot;optimal&quot; level
(i.e., the level required for the competitive provision of the
good or service). The primary implication of Niskanen's theory
was therefore that government agencies and budgets were overlarge,
bloated or overreaching because of the bargaining power of individual
bureaus.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The effect of the oversight process on bureau
policy choices was taken up by Weingast and Moran (1983) in their
study of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). These authors argued
that a bureau is the agent of its oversight committee when it
comes to policy choices. Indeed, they argued that bureaus are
perfect agents of the interest groups represented by oversight
committee members<sup><a href="foot.html">1</a></sup>.  Whatever the prevailing tradeoffs in policies
are (e.g., between consumers and producers, as deciphered, for
example, from the last election), the oversight committee imposes
these trade-offs on the bureau leadership. Reluctant or unreliable
bureau managers are replaced in a relentless drive to establish
the preferred political equilibrium. Weingast and Moran tested
their theory by showing how changing composition of the relevant
oversight committees led to a change in FTC behavior (i.e., case
selection). Their principal-agent approach is now the predominate
method for analyzing bureaucratic behavior in the literature.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >There are two major implications from the literature
with respect to the FDA. Niskanen's work suggests that the FDA,
like other government bureaus, has more resources at its disposal
than are necessary to carry out its legislative mandate, and,
moreover, the FDA will seek to act beyond its Congressional mandate
in policy matters. Weingast and Moran's analytical framework suggests
a more subtle issue to confront, namely, that the FDA is doing
what its congressional sponsors (and the interest groups who support
them, including drug manufacturers) want it to do. If the latter
implication is, in fact, the case, this suggests that the idea
of &quot;reforming&quot; the FDA will be a difficult task indeed,
because the agency may be doing what the relevant interest groups
want it to do. Simply adopting an alternative institutional arrangement
(e.g., contracting out), while maintaining FDA veto authority
over new products, will not necessarily improve FDA behavior.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Given that the FDA is a government monopoly
that determines whether new medical products are safe and effective,
standard microeconomic theory predicts a higher FDA &quot;price&quot;
of approval and a lower quantity of approvals. And the property
rights structure of the FDA reinforces this bias. The FDA is not
the residual claimant for any additional gains realized from earlier
approval; manufacturers receive such gains. Yet if problems arise
from earlier approval, the FDA bears the costs in the form of
a public outcry or a backlash from congressional overseers.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The essential critique of FDA monopoly behavior
is that it spends inordinate resources to police unsafe drugs
and devices so that useful products are delayed in reaching patients.
The historical basis of this behavior is well documented, and
the political model that underlies it is clear. The consequences
of allowing an unsafe product on the market are obvious and politically
disastrous for the agency and its overseers. The consequences
of delaying an otherwise effective and safe drug or device (e.g.,
the lives saved as a result) are much less obvious and less politically
costly (although they may exact used higher &quot;costs&quot;
in terms of needless suffering or death.) The FDA therefore responds
to existing incentives and behaves in a predictable fashion. 
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Moreover, the personification of the consequences
of an unwise decision onto the leadership of the FDA and the relevant
members of Congress intensifies the problem. Voters may prefer
a more expeditious approval process, yet the fact that FDA administrators
face the consequences of toxicity directly implies that they will
prefer more &quot;insurance&quot; than the average voter would
&quot;buy&quot; in such a situation. Bureaucratic incentives thus
compound the problem, making the review process work more conservatively
than individuals in general would prefer. This type of argument
applies to all types of government programs whose outputs involve
risk and uncertainty (e.g., national defense). Thus, in general,
the FDA bureaucracy probably deploys more resources to the prevention
of harm from drugs and devices, at the expense of new drug and
device approval, than the average voter would prefer.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >What are the effects on the drug and medical
device industries of a politicized, risk-averse monopoly in charge
of approval? The expectation is what the empirical record reveals.
The return to innovation has fallen and become more uncertain
and research and development has moved offshore, so there is less
domestic innovation. One observes &quot;approval arbitrage,&quot;
whereby companies concentrate their R&amp;D efforts overseas where
the regulatory burden is not so onerous. More subtly perhaps,
the type of innovative activity may have changed. Owing to the
high costs and uncertain outcome of seeking government approval,
research may tend to focus on lower risk research projects which
manufacturers are confident will pass scrutiny and make money.
The high costs of approval, coupled with an imperfect capital
market, may also act to keep potential entrants out of the industry,
suggesting that the FDA has been &quot;captured&quot; by existing
manufacturers who are quite comfortable with the present system.
The increased uncertainty also raises the cost of capital for
drug and device firms, and acts to reduce the pool of capital
available for funding new research.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >One alternative to the current regime would
be to establish a clear description of  the requirements a new
drug or device must satisfy to be approved, thereby reducing some
of the arbitrariness in the approval process. This is one of the
proposals put forward by former Vice President Quayle's Council
on Competitiveness. This seemingly minor reform would have a number
of beneficial effects. Notably, it would remove much of the variance
in the returns to innovation. A more certain return would allow
firms to fund R&amp;D at lower cost of capital, perhaps spurring
innovation. Investments would no longer have to be certain winners,
and much important work that might have gone undone could be funded.
Fixed rules would also lower the cost of seeking approval by reducing
unanticipated and costly delays arising from requests for more
information. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Such reforms are not a panacea. The FDA is
a governmentally sanctioned monopoly without a profit motive,
and it will bear political costs if drugs and devices are approved
too quickly. To minimize this risk, the FDA will lobby hard to
adopt extremely stringent rules, perhaps to the point of further
reducing the number of approvals.   Even fixed rules will suffer
from &quot;mission creep,&quot; wherein annual revisions gradually
add to the total regulatory burden as the FDA seeks more and more
insurance against a drug or device failure and consumer advocacy
groups trumpet every perceived error by the agency. The FDA's
incentive will continue to revolve around security and budget.
As a government monopoly, there will be no outside competitive
verification that the rules of safe testing are the most efficient
and least costly set of rules that achieves the desired levels
of safety and effectiveness. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >There are a galaxy of potential institutional
reforms that could be applied to the FDA, but there are large
problems which any meaningful reform must address. Chief among
these is the position of the FDA as a premarket monopolist. Given
the monopoly position of the FDA and its accompanying legal authority,
there is a lack of competitive structure in the U.S. drug oversight
and review process, so that service to new-drug sponsors is predictably
at levels that are extremely low and intolerable in other contexts.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The FDA, however, does not exist in a vacuum.
And here the experience of comparable agencies in other countries
may hold the key to understanding how the FDA process could be
improved. There is ample evidence from European countries such
as Great Britain and Germany and the evolving policies in the
European Union (EU) to suggest that the. United States has fallen
into an inefficient approval process. This evidence generally
suggests that European countries are able to bring new products
to the market faster than the United States, while maintaining
substantially equivalent safety and effectiveness results. This
suggests that the institutions of drug and device review and approval
in these countries have attained a better trade-off between protection
and progress than U.S. institutions have. That is, for an equivalent
amount of consumer protection they are able to bring products
to market faster. This competitive discrepancy in U.S. policy
has been apparent for decades, suggesting the need for fundamental
reform of the FDA.  Moreover, some linkage between the United
States and European systems might be in order so as to introduce
a competitive element into the U.S. system.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The present system in the United States works,
but it does not work as well as it could. This is the basic point.
The point is not to scrap the present system, but to make it at
least as effective and efficient as comparable drug and device
review systems around the world.  Recently, there has been a shift
in the preferences of oversight committees, a fact which suggests
(from the literature already reviewed) that the agency will have
to change and that the door is open to reform.  More importantly,
the example of Europe cannot be ignored or denied. These countries
have established faster and equally safe review processes at a
lower level of total expenditure. It is thus imperative that we
learn from the European experience, and explore linking U.S. policy
to European policy.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT >A Simple Model of a Monopoly FDA<sup><a href="foot.html">2</a></sup><BR>
</FONT></I>
<P>
<FONT >The cost of drugs or medical devices can be
characterized using a simple model (as shown in Figure 1) in which
the cost of precaution is traded-off against the cost of remedial
measures in the event of post-approval problems with a drug. Costs
of precaution are shown rising to the right as the level of precautionary
care is increased. These costs represent the effort by the FDA
to keep potentially harmful or useless products off the market.
Costs of remediation are shown declining from left to right based
on the assumption of declining marginal returns from increased
expenditures on precaution. These costs are the effort by the
FDA and manufacturers to engage in post-marketing surveillance
of problems with previously approved products and by manufacturers
to pay for damages their drugs have caused. Theoretically, the
&quot;optimum&quot; level of precautionary measures is at the
point of lowest total cost, and if all these costs are internalized,
this should be the expected level of precautionary care exercised
by manufacturers. On the surface a level of care set by the FDA
at this &quot;minimum&quot; level of total social cost should
guarantee the most efficient market for drug and device use.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >If the FDA could accurately determine the optimum
level of precaution, the government monopoly system might be efficient.
The problem is that it cannot. Regulatory standards are therefore
set according to some &quot;risk&quot; standard that satisfies
the internal requirements of the regulators. Regulators have no
incentive to choose a level of precaution less than the optimum,
so the &quot;optimum&quot; level of care becomes the lower bound
of the standard.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Current FDA standards are positioned somewhere
above the lower bound -- arguably, toward the higher end of the
scale -- resulting in an inefficiently high proportion of resources
put into prevention and a higher total cost than necessary. The
solution to this problem lies in providing better incentives for
firms to internalize the costs of precaution and remediation.
The rest of the paper explores several alternatives in this regard.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >Self-Certification?<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >Self-certification of new drugs and devices
would be the functional equivalent of <I>laissez-faire</I> in
this area of public policy. Firms would be responsible for their
own testing and certification procedures for safety and effectiveness
(which could include the use of third-party certifiers), and would
stand to gain or lose in the marketplace depending upon the reliability
of their products. There are numerous layers of questions with
respect to self-certification. How would it work? How would it
work relative to alternative processes involving government oversight<sup><a href="foot.html">3</a></sup>?The
standard economic analysis of self-certification is related to
Akerlof's (1970) classic paper on &quot;lemons.&quot; He analyzed
a market situation in which sellers have perfect information about
product quality and buyers have limited (prepurchase) information.
In this case bad products come to be overvalued and good products
undervalued, and a sort of Gresham's Law prevails -- bad products
drive good products from the market. Bad products are the only
products that continue to be sold, if the market continues to
exist at all. There is thus an inefficiency in markets with asymmetric
information -- quality levels are too low, and firms have no incentive
to introduce higher quality products because they do not capture
the full benefits from their introduction. A market failure is
said to exist in such cases.<sup><a href="foot.html">4</a></sup>
<p>
This failure does not necessarily
imply that government intervention is the solution to the problem.
The market fails to provide the correct amount of quality relative
to a case where buyers have perfect information. However, since
government cannot provide perfect information either, the issue
becomes how the private sector might respond to such an issue
in conjunction with some form of government oversight.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >There are a variety of ways that firms and
government might respond to the problem of asymmetric information,
some relevant to drugs and medical devices and some not. Firms
can offer guarantees and warranties, factors which would not seem
to apply in the case of drugs and devices. Firms can appeal to
third-party certification organizations such as medical laboratories
and set up a system of industry standards. This approach is directly
applicable to the case of drugs and devices, as will be discussed
below. An alternative approach, which is consistent with relying
upon a <I>laissez-faire</I> version of self-certification, consists
in relying upon firm investments in reputational capital to signal
the presence of high-quality products.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Klein and Leffler (1981) and others have shown
that under certain conditions, where firms have a comparative
advantage in producing and disseminating information about product
quality and where consumers have difficulty in deciphering product
claims before they actually consume the product, markets will
respond by making it worthwhile for firms to invest in brandname
capital (BNC). The concept is simple. Firms have incentives to
invest in BNC as a means of posting a bond with consumers. So
long as a firm produces products that are safe, reliable, and
trustworthy, consumers are willing to pay a premium for such products.
This premium constitutes a flow of payments that are capitalized
into BNC, and the premium represents a quality-assurance payment
by consumers. So long as firms deliver on promises of quality
and credibility, consumers will reward firms with premium payments
for brandnames. In equilibrium the premiums should just offset
the costs to firms of providing quality-assurance services to
consumers. If the firm makes a mistake or chooses to renege upon
its investment in BNC, it will be punished in the marketplace
as consumers will no longer pay a premium for the branded product.
And, indeed, there is ample evidence that drug firms are punished
substantially in this way (Jarrell and Peltzman 1985).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >This is really a point about private contracting.
Klein and Leffler analyzed the role of implicit contracts when
explicit government-enforced contracts are incomplete or too costly
to establish. One form of an implicit enforcement mechanism is
for the potential defector to make an investment in a firm-specific,
nonsalvageable asset. This investment acts as an implicit guarantee
that the firm will not cheat the customer because cheating will
result in forfeiture of the investment. That is, the firm will
lose future business, and the investment in the nonsalvageable
asset will be lost. The purchase of a non-salvageable asset is
equivalent to posting a bond that assures non-cheating behavior.
For their part, customers pay a price premium for the product
to induce the firm not to cheat. In equilibrium the value of the
investment in the nonsalvageable asset just dissipates the &quot;protection
money&quot; offered by buyers so that the firm earns a normal
rate of return on its investment in quality-assurance and provides
a higher-quality product in exchange.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Looking at the argument more closely, one could
argue that asymmetrically distributed information frequently creates
markets. As information costs increase, the probability of informational
entrepreneurship increases, and this probability increases as
demand elasticities decrease. The price component of price elasticities
does not solely reflect the actual price charged for a good, but
the search costs consumers incur prior to paying the price as
well. To the consumer both the search costs and the price paid
for the good represent the cost of consumption. Hence, consumers
with inelastic demands will incur higher search costs, as well
as higher prices, with relatively little change in quantity-demanded.
Also, according to the Alchian and Allen theorem (Alchian and
Allen 1972), high fixed costs generate higher expenditures, (as
long as a couple must hire a baby-sitter when they go out, they
will treat themselves to a nicer dinner.)  High prices, high search
costs, and the opportunity cost of misinformation apply to the
drug and device markets, and a consumer will rationally spend
more on information collection upon incurring these costs. The
consumers' willingness to pay for information, and the high costs
of doing so on their own, create an opportunity for an informational
entrepreneur, who, by specializing in evaluating drugs and devices,
realizes scale economies due to the indivisible nature of information
(upon obtaining the information, his average cost drops as he
distributes the information). These medical products markets will
thus tend to develop informational entrepreneurs.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In medical markets physicians and pharmacists
engage in informational intermediation. For instance, a Doctor's
diagnosis is informational intermediation: the patient has rationally
decided to pay for the doctor's specialization rather than invest
in the human and physical capital required to diagnose himself.
In prescribing a medicine the doctor reduces the patient's transaction
costs. The patient also invests in the additional safeguard of
a pharmacist who specializes in evaluating drugs. If a new medicine
which the pharmacist rates as more effective than as the prescribed
medicine exists, or if the patient's current medicinal regimen
conflicts with the prescription, the pharmacist consults with
the physician to change the prescription (if the applicable state
laws allow). This relationship existed prior to the advent of
the FDA, and in today's more advanced medical industry, it would
surely continue in the absence of the FDA. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >What prevents medical professionals from underinvesting
in medical information? Markets, of course, provide patients with
their first line of defense. A fly-by-night drug firm may invest
little or nothing in some placebo, rendering the credibility of
drug firms suspect. Patients, however, can quite easily inform
themselves about doctors and pharmacists. First, patients observe
the professionals' credible commitments; after years of training
the professionals have invested heavily in human capital and are
unlikely to underinvest in obtaining returns from the investment.
Moreover, doctors and pharmacists operate in a competitive market,
and their fees and volume of business will consequently reflect
their abilities. Lastly, health-care contracts, like all others,
are subject to fraud and liability law. If medical professionals
behave in an uninformed manner, they risk the assets they sunk
in their training and potential legal damages. Rationally, doctors
and pharmacists will require evidence regarding the effectiveness
and safety of a drug or device prior to prescribing or dispensing
it.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Cures for many health maladies occur within
a rather narrow band; only one basic biochemical structure may
effectively vaccinate individuals against the mumps, for instance.
The first firm to discover, patent, and market this structure
obtains a monopoly. A competitive market for medical innovation
exists in pursuit of these monopoly profits. Advocates of government
intervention often cite these factors as creating a &quot;race
for the bottom,&quot; in which firms, rushing their products to
the market, underinvest in both development and testing, leading
to a lowest common denominator market. Justice Brandeis's famous
phrase, however, is as incorrectly applied here as it was when
he coined it for the market for corporate charters. It is the
very existence and pursuit of monopoly profits which assures that
adequate research and testing would occur in the absence of government
intervention.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Without the ability to monopolize markets,
medical innovation would essentially cease. Medical research entails
investments of hundreds of millions of dollars to discover a potential
drug, and such costs are fixed. If, after incurring such massive
expenses and risks, competitive market conditions prevailed and
price was equated to marginal cost, the innovating firm would
not recover its research and development costs, but just the costs
associated with the production of the drug. Obviously, as the
probability of such an event increases, investments in discovery
will decrease. For a firm to invest in research and development
it must expect a downward-sloping demand curve.<sup><a href="foot.html">5</a></sup>
<p>
This, of course,
is a theory of the competitive provision of quality-assurance
by private firms. And it works in a general way in the economy
at large. Firms undertake investments in BNC, and markets punish
firms that renege on such investments. Informational entrepreneurship
does take place. Put another way, one does not tend to observe
pervasive &quot;lemons&quot; problems in modern economies. One
can go across the spectrum of the economy, and find firms behaving
in the manner predicted by the BNC theory. So there is little
doubt that self-certification plays a large role in providing
safe and effective products to consumers.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Would such a system work with drugs or medical
devices? Such a system is certainly an effective alternative to
the present regime of government monopoly. Nonetheless, there
are problematical aspects of a complete self-certification system.
The primary drawback would be that small, undercapitalized firms
might take risks in such an environment which would ultimately
be costly to consumers. The time required for drug development
(15 years) means that incentives might be distorted for small
firms. Such firms, which do not have enough resources to sustain
liability judgments, might very well provide less than optimal
amounts of testing so that consumer harm would result from such
a self-certification system. In other words, small firms might
simply &quot;roll the dice,&quot; hoping to come up with a winning
new product and not be able to sustain a liability judgment if
they are wrong and the product is not safe and effective and causes
harm to consumers. Such considerations dictate some type of government
oversight of drug and device testing.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Perhaps a more telling point about self-certification
is that it is analogous to refereeing your own paper as a academic
specialist. Peer review serves a valuable scientific service in
bringing to bear a more objective evaluation of the contribution
of a scientific paper or result. In addition, peer review generally
leads to an improvement in the quality of scientific papers. Government
oversight of drug and device testing may perform a similar service
for consumers that a self-certification process cannot. Peer review
processes, however, in general show the same kind of bias that
the FDA shows.  (i.e., peer review puts heavy emphasis on culling
out unusual but perhaps path-breaking papers.)<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >It is thus an open question whether self-certification
in practice would lead to an effective system of drug and device
review and testing. And keep in mind that self-certification simply
means that firms can employ any feasible means to test and review
products. Market reactions would reward those firms who provided
the most cost-effective and reliable means of testing and certification.
The problem of small, fly-by-night firms attempting to limit testing
procedures or to mislead consumers would also be disciplined by
market reactions. Nonetheless, there would seem to be some role
for government in overseeing the medical product review process.
In laying out the standards or protocols for product testing,
for example, government could effectively forestall the small,
undercapitalized firm problem. The problem with government oversight
is how to delimit such a function so that innovation and new product
introduction are not stifled as a result. As the experience in
Europe has shown, there are areas, such as low-risk medical devices,
where firms can be allowed to self-certify medical products, subject
to meeting pre-specified government standards. This is not complete
<I>laissez-faire</I>, but it is a way to allow the market to work
with minimal government oversight. <BR>

<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >Remove the FDA Veto Power?<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >A basic conundrum underlies the institutional
analysis of the FDA. If, in fact, the FDA is simply carrying out
the mandate of its legislative overseers, as Weingast and Moran's
(1983) analysis suggests, any institutional arrangement that maintains
the current government monopoly of oversight responsibility will
embody the same incentives as the current system, and will represent
only a marginal improvement over the status quo. This is why some
observers have advocated removing the FDA's veto power over new
drugs and devices (Kazman 1990).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >This is an interesting proposal. In essence,
it represents a full-scale version of <I>laissez-faire</I> in
drug and device certification. In such a regime firms could approach
the market in any way they chose. They could self-certify, use
private third-party certifiers, or use the FDA, which would be
reconstituted as part of an overall competitive certification
process. Such a system has intriguing possibilities in that it
would undoubtedly foster innovation in the certification and testing
process, and the FDA would have to be responsive to such pressures
in this regard. And, over time, consumers would come to rely upon
those certification procedures that worked best. So if one were
to support a <I>laissez-faire</I> approach to certification, letting
the FDA compete in this process might be a good idea.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Such a system is not without problems, however.
In general, it would suffer from the same basic problem that completely
privatized certification suffers; namely, there would likely be
informational failures and asymmetries such that higher quality
products are driven from the market. For example, in a combined
public-private review process without a government veto, small,
undercapitalized firms would have the option to take excessive
risks in the form of introducing incompletely tested products
into the marketplace. In the event of subsequent problems consumer
welfare would suffer.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >So the issue of removing the FDA veto is another
version of the issue of whether <I>laissez-faire</I> will work
as a certification process. Such a system would undoubtedly be
an improvement over some alternative institutional arrangements,
but it seems apparent that some form of government oversight is
necessary to insure that the certification process works in the
interest of consumers. The key is to be able to design an oversight
mechanism that will foster the use of private, competitive testing
procedures and that will speed approval and hasten innovation
in both products and testing procedures while maintaining a core
of essential government oversight over the process. Indeed, limited
government oversight would probably work better than a system
with a vetoless FDA. The presence of a vetoless FDA alongside
alternative private certification institutions would undoubtedly
inhibit the emergence of a robust private certification process
for a variety of fairly obvious reasons, such as the problem that
private firms would have in competing against a government-subsidized
FDA. And for that matter, in the present environment of product
liability lawsuits, companies may not have any choice except to
use the FDA for product approvals.<BR>

<CENTER><B><FONT >Direct Government Involvement in
Certification: The Case of the FAA<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >This particular institutional setting involves
emphasis on self-certification by manufacturers with the direct
involvement of government in the process. In fact, in this case
one does not have to rely upon a hypothetical discussion. The
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) currently implements such
a system for airplane development.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In aviation the key approval required for a
new aircraft comes in the form of a type certification.<sup><a href="foot.html">6</a></sup>All
aircraft flown in the National Airspace System must have a current
airworthiness certificate which implies that a type certification
was granted to the original manufacturer<sup><a href="foot.html">7</a></sup>. This certification requires
that all parts and processes used in the manufacture of the airplane
and that the flying characteristics pass government requirements.
As with drug and device approvals, this certification can be expensive
to obtain.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The basic process is shown below. Manufacturers
begin the design of a new aircraft with certification requirements
in mind. Firms tend to use many existing parts and subassemblies
that have previously been certified as well as certified production
techniques. Before they begin to build the first components, most
manufacturers submit an application of the new design to the FAA.
The FAA responds by putting together a certification team. The
size of this team depends on the complexity and size of the new
aircraft. A small, single-engine aircraft for general aviation
may only involve a few people while a large commercial airliner
may involve a team of hundreds of members. The certification team
meets and reviews the new design. Based on the newness and the
degree of innovation, they inform the manufacturer of certification
requirements after obtaining the manufacturer's input.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Initial Design Concept  Firm Submits Concept
to FAA  FAA Organizes Certification Team   Firm Builds and Tests
Aircraft  FAA Reviews Firm's Test  Final Approval<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The FAA provides inspectors and oversight of
the new aircraft's development and production. Some of these FAA
personnel essentially work full time at the larger plants overseeing
the development and production process. They supervise the testing
of components and manufacturing procedures and verify adherence
to FAA regulations. Thus, the function of independent testing
is performed concurrently with development and production by a
team composed of FAA and company personnel.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >This method provides for incremental approval
due to the continuous certification process. The theory is that
if all components are certified as safe, the full aircraft has
a higher probability of being safe. The FAA requires extensive
flight testing with special emphasis on key flight regimes. This
means that not only does the plane have to have predictable flight
characteristics for its intended functions, but the requirements
are continually updated based on past accidents and problems.
At the end of these tests the FAA awards an air worthiness certificate
that allows the sale and use of the aircraft for commercial and
private purposes. The FAA may also require additional testing
as the result of subsequent accidents, maintenance data, or general
safety concerns after the aircraft has entered service. However,
the bulk of the tests required for recertification will be done
by the manufacturer and submitted to the FAA for approval.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >There are several important features of this
type of certification procedure. First, unlike the FDA procedure,
it gives the manufacturer considerable control over the time required
for certification. Firms can invest heavily in testing in order
to get a product to market more quickly. Part of this is accomplished
by careful planning and coordination with the FAA in the initial
meetings. The rest can be accomplished by investing in flight
test facilities or services. Second, firms are less under the
control of government schedules and bureaucracies. Third, the
self-certification system provides a slightly weaker liability
position for the firms. The firm has only itself and a few government
inspectors to uncover all problems. Thus, it is possible that
this shorter approval process has a higher cost in the form of
greater liability exposure.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Indeed, the element of self-certification involved
in the production of aircraft has contributed to the liability
problems of the industry, and there is still the &quot;refereeing
your own paper&quot; type of problem with self-certification systems.
And even with a great deal of government oversight, it seems unlikely
that drug firms would do their own certifying. Independent certification
provides a form of quality-assurance to consumers that self-certification
cannot. For such reasons the FAA system does not seem amenable
to the drug review process, and in some respects would probably
come to represent a bureaucratic nightmare for the industry. Nonetheless,
elements of this model are applicable to some medical devices.<sup><a href="foot.html">8</a></sup>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >Private Monopoly with Government
Oversight<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >This alternative consists in establishing a
single national laboratory or certified body which would conduct
the oversight and review of drug and device development programs
and applications for marketing approval under the supervision
of the FDA. The primary benefit of such a system would be that,
relative to the present system, a private body would have an incentive
to operate efficiently and to innovate in the review process to
a degree that the present system does not. This presumes, of course,
that some of the gains from innovation could be retained by the
private body. The primary disadvantage of this process is that
the continuation of government veto power would leave the present
system little changed. For example, the private monopoly right
could be revoked by the FDA if the monopolist deviated substantially
from the preferences of the bureaucracy which runs the present
system. So, at best, private monopoly with government oversight
would represent  only a modest improvement over the present system.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Moreover, such a system brings with it a host
of problems familiar to students of public utility regulation.
How would the private monopoly be chartered? How would it set
prices for its services?  If simply left to its own devices, the
private monopoly laboratory would charge monopoly prices for its
services where &quot;price&quot; is construed to be some combination
of money cost and waiting time for certification services.  Such
monopolistic behavior would retard the review process relative
to a more competitive arrangement for the provision of testing
services.  Any attempt to regulate the private monopoly would
rest upon issues similar to those raised in public utility regulation.
Would the monopoly right be rebid, say, every ten years? Would
there be extensive and detailed price regulation? What regulatory
biases and gamesmanship would result? <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >This morass of regulatory issues can be avoided
by having more than one certified body to which firms can turn
for services. And unless some sort of economic justification,
such as economies of scale, can be found, there is no compelling
reason to have a single monopoly laboratory with government oversight.
Such a system would be cumbersome, and while perhaps exhibiting
better behavior than the present system of government monopoly
in terms of innovation and cost control, there would not likely
be that much difference between the two in practice.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >A simple model of a monopoly laboratory is
presented in the appendix. The moral of this analysis is simply
that the regulation of a private monopoly certification service
with respect to the provision of safety services, even assuming
a benign overseer with a sole interest in consumer welfare, would
be quite complicated. And while there are examples of such systems
in the private sector (the Institute of Nuclear Power Operations),
it is not easy to see how such a scheme could be applied to the
case of medical products. Regulation of a private monopoly is
difficult and problematical in any event, so that there is no
reason to expect the case of drugs and devices to be any different.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >Government Monopoly with Contracting
Out<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >This system of institutional review would maintain
FDA pre-market approval for new drugs and devices, but contract
out the actual certification programs. This is roughly equivalent
to what has been done to date by the FDA from time to time at
every level of the system except final approval.  It is also equivalent
to other government procurement programs under which specified
products or services are purchased from qualified contractors.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Contracting out is quite different from the
system described below as government oversight with competing
private laboratories. In the case of contracting out, private
contractors would bid to the FDA for business, while in a private
competing laboratories model, product sponsors would solicit the
services of private laboratories directly. In either case, the
FDA would regulate the private contractors or the private competing
laboratories.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The distinction between the two systems is
important. Undoubtedly, there are benefits to the contracting
out system relative to the present government monopoly with in-house
certification by the FDA. Private contractors could be expected
to be more efficient and innovative than government in-house reviewers.
Such incentives could reside, for example, in the concept of a
&quot;regulatory lag.&quot; Where equally reliable testing and
review procedures can be performed at lower cost, profits on a
given contract will improve. There are thus persistent incentives
to improve the design and review of product development programs
under contracting out that do not exist under the present system.
Over time, contracting costs will fall as firms pass along the
savings in bids for future work. Contracting out would also increase
the speed of the review process (as it could be done concomitantly),
and more drugs and devices could be reviewed at any point in time,
with consequent beneficial feedback for firms' investments in
research and development.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The other side of the coin, however, is that
government contracting carries with it a host of incentive and
other problems which have been studied in detail in the literature
(see Scherer 1964; McCall 1970; and Baron, 1972). It is not always
clear, for example, that competitive bidding yields the least-cost
supplier of services. Moreover, there have been a host of problems
associated with cost overruns. Also, the bureaucracy created by
delegating to the outside, and then reintegrating the results
into a review process that has always been beyond the agency's
managerial ability to control, simply increases complexity and
plays to FDA's weaknesses. For such reasons it is more likely
that the benefits of government contracting can be obtained without
the associated costs by adoption of a system of private laboratories
which would compete directly for the business of drug and device
firms. Such a system is closely akin to certain models in the
EU and several European countries, and is discussed in more detail
in the next  two sections.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >Competing Private Firms with Government
Oversight<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >This institutional arrangement would consist
of maintaining a final governmental review over new drugs and
high-risk devices, while relying upon competing private firms
for  sponsor oversight and certification services.  These private
certification firms would do a lot more than simply issue certificates.
They could perform a range of functions, currently performed by
the FDA, that are needed in order to be able to certify.  This
procedure is seen in the present European system for medical device
certification, so that examples of how such a system would work
can be drawn from the European experience. This model is also
analogous to the way in which the Underwriter's Laboratory works
in the United States; a discussion of the Underwriter's Laboratory
is thus also in order.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The European medical device system embodies
a set of standards which devices must meet. Although only a small
fraction of devices need to be regulated as drugs are regulated
(i.e., need to have a pre-market approval), it nevertheless is
instructive to examine how European device regulation works for
the entire range of devices.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In order to meet the required standards, manufacturers
are allowed a great deal of flexibility. For some low-risk devices,
manufacturers are allowed to self-certify that their products
meet the necessary standards. This &quot;light-touch&quot; regulation
requires only that the manufacturers, in addition to meeting strict
manufacturing and quality-control standards, maintain records
as to the reliability of a device and be available for questioning
should a problem develop.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >For higher-risk products manufacturers must
seek certification from third-parties, the so-called &quot;notified
bodies.&quot; Examples of such bodies, or private laboratories,
are BSI in Great Britain, TUVs in Germany, and KEMA in the Netherlands.
 Notified bodies supply certification services to firms, based
on analyses and oversight that they do in the form of testing
products and inspecting manufacturing systems. Approval of a product
by a notified body is tantamount to government approval:  the
product can then be marketed.  The notified bodies themselves
are subject to regulation by government with respect to their
operations as certifiers. In addition, as in the United States,
there is post-introduction reporting of adverse incidents. Such
incidents must be reported by manufacturers and users, and in
cooperation with national government authorities the manufacturer
makes an appropriate decision with respect to correcting problems
or taking the product off the market.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Thus, the European system relies upon elements
of self-certification for low-risk devices, third-party certification
for higher-risk devices, and post-market surveillance of adverse
incidents. The role of government in this process is limited to
standard-setting, regulation of the third-party certifying agencies,
scrutiny of the clinical development program, and dealing with
adverse incident problems once products are in the marketplace.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The effects of this system have been salutary.
Approval times are considerably faster in Europe -- 250 days as
compared to 820 days for a PMA review in the U.S. (Wilkerson Group,
1995.)  And there is no evidence that the European system produces
less safe outcomes than the United States system. It is therefore
possible that a system based on the elements of self-certification
(subject to government standards) and third-party certification
can produce a marked improvement over the government monopoly
system presently in place in the U.S. Indeed, the FDA has proposed
a trial of the use of third-party certification for low-risk devices.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >It is not a great leap to extend the European
system from devices to drugs. The U.S. requires a cumbersome IND
filing before first human testing while the U.K., for example,
does not.  At the market-approval stage, the review authority
in the U.K. gives more responsibility to a committee of independent
medical experts who have a consulting relationship to the agency.
 Moreover, the FDA, being the only regulator in the U.S. drug
market, necessarily acts differently than regulatory agencies
in, say, the U.K. and Germany. In the case of the EC's decentralized
 registration procedures, each national authority must compete
with 11 other national regulatory agencies in the EU, each agency
being concerned with the price of medicinal products in its domestic
market due to their respective government's role in the provision
of health care services.  It is also worth emphasizing that the
European agencies are fee-based. They thus have a meaningful profit
motive which arguably drives them to provide speedier and more
efficient reviews of new drugs.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT >The Underwriter's Laboratory<BR>
</FONT></I>
<P>
<FONT >There is a certification system in the United
States for various products and equipment which operates in a
fashion  similar to some aspects of the European system for medical
device review. This system is typified by the activities of the
Underwriter's Laboratory (UL), and is worth considering in some
detail.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The UL is a large, not-for-profit organization
that certifies over 14,000 types of products using over 650 standards
(a &quot;standard&quot; is a detailed specification for a product
class that may run to many pages).  In addition to electrical
appliances and equipment, the UL also certifies automotive and
mechanical products, fire-resistant building materials, bullet-resistant
glass, and OSHA-designated &quot;hazardous location&quot; products,
among many others.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The UL tests and certifies products which present
inherent potential hazards to life and property. Except in special
cases, the UL does not offer an effectiveness mandate, but is
only concerned with safety issues. The exceptions are life-safety
products such as fire extinguishers and smoke detectors. In these
cases performance issues are also considered. The UL has never
underwritten any risk of the products that they certify. The business
of the UL is information; they are solely a testing and certifying
body.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The UL is completely private and independent.
There is no statutory or court-ordered requirement that forces
manufacturers to seek UL approval. Such activity is a purely voluntary
act on the part of manufacturers. The UL holds no <I>de facto</I>
or <I>de jure</I> monopoly on safety certification. In the United
States there are several competing standard-setting laboratories.
Not all laboratories use the UL's standards, but there is a high
degree of similarity among the competing standards. The UL is
much larger and older than any of its competitors and holds the
dominant position in the market. The primary regulator of the
UL and its competitors is the Occupational Safety and Health Administration
(OSHA).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >As noted above, the UL publishes over 650 standards
(the guidelines under which they test and approve products). These
standards are known to manufacturers in advance and cover specific
end-products. New standards are written according to the evolution
of market demand. As the demand for UL certification increases,
the UL formulates initial guidelines outlining their testing procedure
and the criteria products will have to meet to receive certification.
This information is distributed to interested bodies, such as
councils of manufacturers, insurers, and consumers. The UL asks
for comments and criticisms from these organizations, amending
their approach as necessary. This process results in a &quot;proposed
standard&quot; which undergoes the same scrutiny as the preliminary
information. The process evolves into &quot;published standards&quot;
which are made available to manufacturers. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >UL approval is not equivalent to governmental
approval. Ultimately, the use of products is still governed by
law, frequently under the jurisdiction of local inspectors, such
as the Fairfax County Fire or Building Inspector. In theory, and
perhaps in practice, local codes can ban a UL-approved product
or order its removal. In practice, such actions are extremely
rare.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >No form of legal mandate requires a product
to display a UL approval mark. However, many retailers are reluctant
to carry products lacking UL approval, and, occasionally, insurers
may deny liability coverage for unapproved products. As in the
textbook case of an investment in a non-salvageable asset, all
concerned parties benefit from the transaction, and firms, insurers,
and the UL all have incentives to maintain high quality standards.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The certification process begins when a manufacturer
delivers a batch of product to the UL. The UL informs the firm
of the standard under which they will test the product. If the
manufacturer agrees to continue, the UL prepares a safety report
and offers a &quot;procedure&quot; to be kept by the manufacturer
at his facility. The procedure lists the specific building materials
of the sample batch, as well as the manufacturing procedure, and
so on. The firm cannot deviate from the procedure, or they will
lose UL approval. The UL has field inspectors who visit manufacturers'
facilities to insure that the procedure is being followed.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The fee that the UL charges for its services
is based on a cost-of-testing approach, and depends on the testing
required by the particular published standard that covers the
good in question. Cost is also affected by the manufacturer's
choice of materials used in the product. If it is manufactured
using mostly UL approved materials, testing is less costly than
otherwise. The UL charges a flat fee for its field inspection
service and charges for its inspectors by the hour.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Notwithstanding all the discussion of the UL's
independence and the discipline imposed on the UL by the market,
it faces a specific regulatory burden. In fact, the UL is an actual,
working example of a competing laboratory with government regulation.
The UL and its direct competitors are certified by OSHA as &quot;nationally
recognized testing laboratories&quot; (NRTL), in accordance with
specific statutory guidelines. OSHA offers certification to any
laboratory that can meet its standards. The standards are not
arbitrary, and are available from OSHA.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The UL's direct competitors are also NRTLs.
Not all NRTLs are standard-setting bodies. Many use the UL's standards
directly, and offer some compensating differential in cost or
ancillary services to attract business. Some set their own standards
and testing protocols, independent of the actions of the UL, though
there do not seem to be great differences among the competing
standards. Typically, the UL's direct competitors are smaller,
newer, and for-profit enterprises. The UL's not-for-profit status
is likely the result of its curious history and inception. Since
its beginning, the UL's stated mission has been &quot;testing
for public safety.&quot; Though the UL has received revenue to
defray the costs of testing, its activities were always deemed
to be a public service. The UL maintains this position (over the
complaints of its competitors), and this history motivated the
UL to change its status to a not-for-profit organization.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >No other country uses UL standards, but most
foreign countries have their own certifying bodies, testing laboratories,
and standards. There is no set of bilateral or unilateral reciprocal
agreements with respect to UL standards. However, there are &quot;memoranda
of understanding&quot; between the UL and many of its foreign
counterparts. Though these agreements do not call for accepting
the certification of an overseas laboratory, they are reciprocal
on many levels, and in many instances the standards are similar
across national boundaries.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The UL's relationship with Canada goes beyond
a memorandum of understanding. The UL is certified by the National
Standards Council of Canada to test products for use in Canada
under standards specifically written for Canada. All products
approved for Canadian consumption bear the UL mark. The UL's Canadian
standards are similar but not identical to the UL's U.S. standards.
The UL is currently involved in writing common standards for the
United States and Canada.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The UL has not been exposed to excessive liability
concerns. There have been few lawsuits brought against the UL,
and these have been considered to be weak. The UL is occasionally
subpoenaed in connection with a lawsuit brought against a manufacturer,
but it provides no expert witnesses or any trial support. The
fact that the UL, as an independent third party, has certified
a product does not make the UL jointly liable for that product's
performance in the field. Neither does UL certification attach
the UL to manufacturer negligence. Basically, the UL answers two
questions: one, has the manufacturer taken the appropriate safeguards;
and two, was the product batch sent to the UL for testing found
to be safe? The UL mark signifies that the sample sent for testing
was found to be safe under a published standard, and the UL expects
that further products manufactured in the same manner using similar
materials are also likely to be safe. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The UL model, of course, is not a perfect fit
for the purposes of new drug and device review and certification.
 More is involved in drug and device approval than simply testing
a batch of products according to some manufacturer's standard.
 This is obvious.  Nonetheless, given the legal right to do so,
it is possible then the UL could seek to expand its capabilities
to be able to perform these functions.  This could involve the
retention of qualified experts to make judgments according to
the necessary standards.  In other words, both the UL and the
FDA can test a product according to specifications, but neither
the UL nor the FDA can test a drug's efficacy and safety.  Rather,
they would have to evaluate the evidence  by first checking that
it was obtained correctly and that it is accurate and truthful,
 and then that it has been interpreted correctly and satisfies
the law.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Both the European system for devices and the
UL illustrate the potential gains from applying a private certification
system in the United States to new devices and drugs. When coupled
with careful regulation of the certification industry and its
incentives, the private supply of testing services can potentially
provide as much  or more safety and effectiveness as the present
system, while speeding the flow of new drugs and devices into
the medical marketplace.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > </FONT>
<P>
<FONT >These private bodies could do a great deal
more than simply certify new products.  They would perform a scientific
review function to ensure the accuracy and truthfulness and interpretation
of results such that the existing law is satisfied.  Privatizing
this function and devolving it from the FDA has many advantages,
not the least of which is to afford the opportunity to bring the
very best scientists into the process of evaluating the safety
and effectiveness of new medical products. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Moreover, as discussed earlier in the analysis
of self-certification systems, there is little basis to expect
a &quot;race for the bottom&quot; out of this system. The FDA
would have regulatory oversight over the private laboratories
and certifiers, as well as review authority over their recommendations.
Such factors, as well as market incentives to maintain reputational
capital as a competent testing organization, would insure a healthy
evolution of private certification laboratories.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >Competing Jurisdictions<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >One way to look at the problem of institutional
reform of the FDA, building upon the example of the EU, is to
suggest th
<h2>I. Istitutional Alternatives for the Regulatio
evolution of EU institutions and their faster approval times may
reflect the reality that the individual country processes for
drug and device review must compete with one another, and such
competition has beneficial effects.  In the decentralized drug
review procedure of the EU system, sponsors can choose the national
agency to which they submit first.  This has resulted in intense
competition among the national agencies.  Indeed, Great Britain's
agency has done a marketing tour of the United States touting
its fast response time and its competitive cost.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The FDA monopoly in the United States. is not
in a similar position to the European agencies. So linking the
U.S. process to those in other countries might well make the issue
of institutional reform moot. Countries could choose review institutions
as they saw fit, and jurisdictional competition would mold these
institutions over time to comply with constituent interests. Jurisdictions
and firms which were effective would receive more revenue from
drug approvals, and so on. Obviously, jurisdictional competition
involves both costs and benefits, and it is a big leap to imagine
that the United States would be willing to enter a simple international
agreement under which products approved in other countries could
be marketed in the United States But some such linkage may be
desirable to support genuine institutional reform in the United
States<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Indeed, the European model provides at least
two implications for the United States  First, Europe's national
interagency competition within the EU is a model of how competition
between private certifiers could work in the United States  Second,
Europe's governmental certifying bodies can be set up in competition
with the FDA by appropriate international recognition agreements.
 Some further analysis of this latter type of action would be
useful.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The textbook case for jurisdictional competition
is the example of corporate law in the United States Each state
has evolved an individualized chartering system for corporations,
and have competed for corporate chartering revenues for more than
100 years. Over this time Delaware has become a preferred jurisdiction
in which to incorporate, but firms can incorporate in any state.
The issues, then, are why does this system of corporate chartering
work so well and could it be extended by analogy to the process
of drug and device review?<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The definition of a corporation is simple --
it is a business entity characterized by share ownership and limited
liability. The first component simply constitutes a contract between
a firm and its equity suppliers, and how a state governs this
relationship does not affect any other state's relations with
the firm. Jurisdictional reciprocity, therefore, is contingent
upon each jurisdiction recognizing limited liability as desirable.
Consequently, reciprocity does not require agreement on any other
issues, and jurisdictions are free to experiment with various
forms of corporate governance and judge their efficiency by how
the market reacts. States subsequently become responsive to the
changing needs of business, and as long as they do not respond
with severe alterations of the limited-liability principle, they
can change virtually any other component of corporate governance
without affecting the reciprocity agreement.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Defining a corporation is possibly easier than
defining what constitutes a &quot;safe and effective&quot; drug.
In agreeing to reciprocity, jurisdictions would state that they
accept the definitions of other jurisdictions, and in the case
of drugs and devices, that they approve of the testing methods
employed. A reciprocity agreement, therefore, would inevitably
require some minimum standards for membership. These standards,
however, constrain the ability of jurisdictions to differentiate
their processes, and thereby allow the political market to signal
its preferences. While jurisdictions in the market for corporate
charters differentiate their products through the governance components,
a market in drug and device certification has no margins upon
which to operate except for an agreed-upon concept of the definition
of  safety and effectiveness and the methods for testing.  Changes
in this definition necessarily alter the nature of reciprocity.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Moreover, rather than the continuous and infinite
relationship between corporations and their domiciles, drug and
device approvals entail discrete transactions. Firms do not evaluate
where they should submit all of their products, but consider each
case individually. If a jurisdiction changes its process, firms
can submit future products to other jurisdictions. In a worst-case
scenario a race for the bottom could occur as each jurisdiction
simply rushed to approve the products manufactured within its
borders and export them to other markets. Nonetheless, this is
not what appears to have happened among European countries. To
the contrary, competition among countries has led to the evolution
of outstanding agencies for drug and device review and approval;
there has not been a race to the bottom.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >International agreements are, of course, not
easy to negotiate, and reciprocity in drug and device approval
would be no exception to this rule. Most, if not all, of the benefits
of jurisdictional competition, however, could probably be obtained
by adopting a system with competing certifiers in the United States
Indeed, a rigorous private certification industry in the United
States would likely strengthen the prospects for linkage with
the systems of other countries, as such a change in policy would
put our system on par with the structure of the emerging European
systems.</FONT><sup><a href="foot.html">9</a></sup>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >Conclusion</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >The weight of the evidence presented here suggests
that improvements are clearly possible in the drug and medical
device certification processes as they currently operate in the
United States The evidence that certain European systems perform
better than the FDA process is compelling. The model of government
oversight with private certifiers has several advantages. It would
bring state of the art scientists and scientific methods into
the process of drug and device certification. It would foster
innovation in drug and device evolution, oversight, and certification
procedures, leading to lower costs, faster approval rates, and
enhanced safety and effectiveness. It would cut down on bureaucratic
red tape and delay. It would not require any changes in the existing
legal standards applied by the FDA. For these and various other
reasons, movement to a system of competitive certification performed
by private laboratories and testing groups commends itself for
the consideration of policymakers.<BR>

<CENTER><B><FONT >Appendix: The Private Monopoly Laboratory
<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >Suppose that the monopoly laboratory has an
oversight committee. For purposes of clarity, naively assume that
the committee members are interested in maximizing consumer welfare,
and, therefore, political variables are ruled out. The monopolist
is assumed to be a standard profit-maximizer producing certifications
at a price, P. Price is a function of the number of new drugs
certified, ND, and safety, s, of the drugs. Thus, P=p(ND,s). Total
cost is a function of safety and the number of new drugs certified,
and increases with respect to safety. Thus, C=c(ND,s). <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The oversight committee is interested in maximizing
consumer welfare, W, and, therefore, would like the area under
the demand curve and above production costs to be maximized, i.e.,
it would like the monopoly to maximize:</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > (1) <IMG SRC="IMG00004.GIF">.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The first-order conditions are:<BR>

<FONT > (3) <IMG SRC="IMG00007.GIF"></FONT>
<P>
<FONT >where subscripts denote partial derivatives.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The monopolist, however, is interested in maximizing
profits and therefore attempts to maximize:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > (4) <IMG SRC="IMG00008.GIF"><BR>
</FONT>

<FONT >Its first-order conditions are:<BR>

<P>
<FONT > (6) <IMG SRC="IMG00010.GIF"><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >From (3) the oversight committee is concerned
with the impact of increased safety on all consumers (from the
integral), while from (6) the monopolist is concerned with the
impact of increased safety on the marginal consumer. Furthermore,
when <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > (7) <IMG SRC="IMG00011.GIF"></FONT>
<P>
<IMG SRC="IMG00012.GIF">
<P>
<FONT >the monopolist undersupplies safety from the
oversight committee's point of view. The committee then arguably
orders the monopoly to increase the safety of its certified drugs
at the cost of reduced monopoly profits. It is important to note,
however, that it may not be possible for the oversight committee
to discern the consumer-maximizing output decision. The monopoly
may exaggerate the impact of increased safety on price, P<SUB>s</SUB>,
to the extent that the inequality in (7) becomes an equality.
In this case the oversight committee believes that the appropriate
level of safety is being provided, when in reality the level of
safety is not as high as desired. Even when the committee has
oversight on the level of profits realized, the monopoly may engage
in X-inefficiency, and thus still provide lower than desired levels
of safety.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Dorfman and Steiner (1954) modeled a monopolist
whose product demand is a function of price and advertising. Consider
this approach but, instead, focus on safety rather than advertising.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Thus, the monopolist maximizes:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > (8) <IMG SRC="IMG00013.GIF"><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >where the cost function is now additive in
new drugs and safety and, as before, ND=N(p,s). Maximizing with
respect to p and s, the first-order conditions are:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > (9) <IMG SRC="IMG00014.GIF"></FONT>
<P>
<FONT >and</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > (10) <IMG SRC="IMG00015.GIF"><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >where, again, subscripts denote partial derivatives.
Denoting E<SUB>p</SUB> = -ND<SUB>p</SUB>[p/ND] as the elasticity
of demand with respect to price and E<SUB>s </SUB>= -ND<SUB>s</SUB>[s/ND]
as the elasticity of demand with respect to drug safety, then,
as Dorfman and Steiner showed, (9) and (10) can be rearranged
as<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > (11) <IMG SRC="IMG00016.GIF"><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >This is a version of the Dorfman-Steiner condition.
For a given E<SUB>s,</SUB> the greater the elasticity of demand
with respect to price, E<SUB>p</SUB>, the smaller the safety to
sales of new drugs ratio. Given that the demand for new drugs
is highly inelastic with respect to price, which in the case of
life-threatening diseases may the case, safety relative to total
sales of new drugs will be high, other thing equal.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Nonetheless, given the simplistic nature of
this analysis, the oversight committee may get less safety than
the amount desired. This is the case when the marginal valuation
of safety to the average consumer is greater than that of the
marginal consumer. In an attempt to maximize profits the monopolist
undersupplies safety, according to the oversight committee. Also,
when the price elasticity of demand for new drugs is high relative
to the safety elasticity of demand, the level of safe certifications
relative to total sales of new drugs is low. And, as stressed
above, by exaggerating the impact of safety on price, the monopoly
can still maximize profits by undersupplying certification of
safe new drugs, and even if the committee regulates its profits,
the monopoly may still undersupply safety by engaging in X-inefficiency.
The point is simply that even with a benign oversight committee
bent on maximizing consumer welfare, regulation of the monopoly
laboratory easily becomes a quagmire. And, undoubtedly, the more
realistic the model is made, the deeper the quagmire.<BR>

<h2>Therapeutic Drugs and Biologics</h2>
by Henry I. Miller and William M. Wardell<P>

<CENTER><B><FONT >EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</B></FONT></B>
<BR>
</FONT></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >The goal of this proposal is to speed the delivery
of safe and effective new drugs and biologics to patients in need.
 To achieve it, the plan proposes changes in the current regulatory
system that will facilitate early clinical research, increase
the efficiency of drug development and its regulatory oversight,
and reduce the overall time and cost required for safe new drugs
to reach the market.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >The Need For Reform</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >The existing system for regulating drugs in
the United States has been fairly successful, as narrowly defined
by an assurance that products admitted to the market are reasonably
safe and effective.  By broader measures, however, it has failed.
The development and approval of new drugs and biologics is too
slow and costly.  The present system wastes the resources of both
the pharmaceutical industry and the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA). In the name of safety and effectiveness at any cost, the
development of many promising new therapies is prevented, and
the availability of new products delayed.  An unnecessary burden
is being borne by patients, by U.S. industry, and by the national
economy -- unnecessary because safety and effectiveness do not
have to be sacrificed for innovation and the introduction of greater
efficiency. We need a wiser balance of objectives.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The total time required for drug development,
from synthesis of the molecule to marketing approval, has more
than doubled -- from 6.5 to 14.8 years -- since 1964.  The time
from an Investigational New Drug (IND) filing to a New Drug Application
(NDA) approval now averages 8 years.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >FDA has raised the regulatory burden on drug
sponsors by continually introducing new requirements and policies
without due regard for their potential to hinder the delivery
of new and innovative therapies to patients who need them.  The
drug-development system in the United States has become the most
ponderous and expensive in the world.  The cost of bringing a
drug to market now averages more than $350 million. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >There has been broad consensus for nearly three
decades that reforms are necessary, but few have been implemented,
and none expeditiously or widely.  Occasional attempts by FDA
to streamline regulation are little more than window-dressing.
 The inability of the executive branch of government -- including
FDA -- to reform itself necessitates legislative action to change
the scope and procedures of oversight.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Numerous official panels and inquiries over
the past 30 years have proposed remedies for the deficiencies
of the system.  The most important and consistently repeated of
these recommendations has been the need for <I>management and
structural reforms</I> that would transfer some tasks currently
performed internally by FDA to outside experts and organizations.
 While FDA has at one time or another delegated most of its review
and evaluation functions (except final sign-off for approval)
to outside experts or entities, the delegation has been piecemeal
and disorganized; partial privatization has never been integrated
in a way that could create an efficient overall system. The plan
proposal corrects that and creates a system with these recommended
management and structural reforms at its core.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Other reforms recommended repeatedly have included
a lesser role for FDA in the scrutiny of early-phase clinical
investigations and the wider use of accelerated approvals coupled
with continued post-market surveillance.  These recommendations
are adopted, explicitly or implicitly, in the current proposal.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >The Proposal<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >While rationalizing and enhancing the efficiency
of the process for developing, reviewing, and approving new drugs
and biologics,<I> the proposal maintains the existing legal requirement
for pre-market demonstration of safety and effectiveness</I>.
 Preserved as well are FDA's enforcement powers and the agency's
authority to issue the final sign-off approval for product marketing.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The key changes are these:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >1) Primary responsibility for managing the
Investigational New Drug (IND) filing, oversight of the clinical
program, and New Drug Application (NDA)/Product License Application
(PLA) review will be transferred from FDA to Drug Certification
Bodies (DCBs).  The DCBs, which can be private- or public-sector
(university) organizations, for-profit or non-profit, will be
certified by FDA and staffed -- as required by the language of
the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act -- with &quot;experts qualified
by scientific training and experience.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >2) The sponsor will submit NDAs (or PLAs) to
the DCB, not to FDA.  After evaluating the NDA, the DCB will submit
the results of its review (if favorable) to FDA. The FDA Commissioner
will then have a finite period of time in which to accept the
DCB's recommendation for approval (which, legally, is a &quot;rebuttable
presumption&quot;) or to deny approval. If approval is denied,
at the discretion of the sponsor and the DCB, a review may be
undertaken by an independent appeals panel reporting to the Secretary
of HHS.  All parties, including the FDA, will be expected to accept
the decision of the Secretary. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >These reforms will encourage greater efficiency
and cost-effectiveness via competition among the DCBs, improvements
which will affect both the tactics and the strategy of drug development
and approval.  DCBs' competition for sponsor-clients will favor
those that perform effective problem-solving for the client, manage
the oversight and review efficiently, and perform reviews in a
timely way.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Economic pressures will encourage the DCBs
to be competent and timely, and to cultivate a reputation for
integrity -- traits that will be most highly prized by clients.
 The enormous complexity and myriad alternatives at various steps
in the drug development process provide the DCB opportunities
to add value to the client's product.  Just in the realm of clinical
trials, the choice of endpoints, indications, and trial design
strongly influences the size, time and cost of development programs;
therefore, there is significant potential for savings of time
and money.  Subject to the legal standard of safety and effectiveness,
DCBs will be encouraged to devise innovative and more efficient
ways of developing drugs and getting them approved.  This strategic
competition among DCBs and cooperation between DCBs and sponsors
will transform the drug development and approval process and redress
the current trend of increasing time and costs.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >More efficient management of the oversight
and review process will reduce the time and costs required for
drug development and approval.  In this way, greater numbers of
new drugs will become available to patients in a timelier fashion.<BR>

<h3><FONT >REGULATORY REFORM:  IMPORTANCE,
HISTORY, AND GOALS</h3>
</FONT></CENTER>
<P>
<B><FONT >The Need For New Therapies</B>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >American patients and physicians need and deserve
more rapid access to greater numbers of safe and effective drugs.
 It is clearly in the public interest to encourage pharmaceutical
innovation -- the discovery, development, and marketing of new
therapies.  Over the past 35&nbsp;years however, regulations originally
designed to protect public health by preventing the sale or use
of unsafe or ineffective products have themselves become impediments
to progress in the field.  The evolution of pharmaceutical regulation
has moved inexorably in one direction: toward more stringent,
burdensome, and intrusive oversight as FDA has assumed more and
more responsibilities and power.  As the Presidents Biomedical
Panel concluded in 1976, the delays and costs that the FDA's protective
systems impose on drug development constitute a &quot;hazard to
public health&quot;<sup><a href="foot.html">1</a></sup>.  In 1973 the president's Science Advisory
Committee concluded that it may &quot;be worth adapting US regulations
so that not even a single important new entity introduced into
selected foreign countries during the previous year fails to become
available in the US.&quot;<sup><a href="foot.html">2</a></sup><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >This proposal seeks to restore a more appropriate
balance between regulation and innovation - but without jeopardizing
product safety - by facilitating the development and regulatory
review of pharmaceuticals.  Public health will be maintained and
even enhanced.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT >Why is Innovation so Difficult and Costly?</b></FONT>
<P>
<FONT >It is a fact that the development and approval
of new drugs in the United States takes too long.  The total time
for drug development, from discovery or synthesis of the molecule
to NDA approval, has more than doubled since 1964, from an average
of 6.3 years, in the period 1963-1965 to 15.0 years, in the period
1990-1992.  The time from IND filing to NDA approval (the most
highly regulated portion) now averages 8 years in the United States
-- two years longer than in Europe.  There have been dazzling
advances in discovery, such as the cloning of receptors and the
use of transgenic animals for both toxicology testing and human
disease models. But regulatory burdens have hampered innovation,
compromised the availability of new therapeutics, and wasted the
resources of both FDA and the pharmaceutical industry.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >As the time required for drug development has
lengthened, the average &quot;effective patent life&quot; - that
is, the time remaining from NDA approval to expiration of the
main patent -- has declined correspondingly, a double disincentive
for sponsors considering drug development. Effective patent life,
nearly 14 years in 1966, declined to less than seven years in
the early 1980s.  The Waxman-Hatch Patent Restoration Act of 1984
restored, at most, half of this loss, and required other substantial,
costly concessions from the research-based drug industry, notably
earlier approval of generic drugs.  It is the effects of these
and other disincentives to research that are being seen in the
consolidation of the research-based industry today.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Analyses of innovation in the U.S. pharmaceutical
industry show that its research output, as measured by the introduction
of INDs for new chemical entities (NCEs), declined rapidly and
significantly after the 1962 law was enacted.  The decline occurred
in several phases.  There was an immediate decline (by more than
50 percent) in the early 1960s.  Then for a decade the output
was fairly constant, but in the mid-1970s it fell again by another
50 percent.  It recovered somewhat in the early 1980s.  However,
in the last decade it has declined again, although in the 1990s
the shortfall in NCEs has been compensated by &quot;new biotechnological
entities&quot; (NBEs), the corresponding biotechnology product
candidates.  (DiMasi et al, CPT 1994)<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >It would be overstating the case to argue that
all impediments to innovation derive from regulation.  The process
of innovation -- a lengthy and complex one involving discovery
and development, including clinical testing -- is formidably difficult
and expensive.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In addition to the scientific and technological
hurdles, there are new obstacles in marketing. Over the past decade
there have been fundamental changes in the nature of the market
for pharmaceuticals and in the product criteria needed to succeed
there. The days of the manufacturer selling a new drug directly
to individual physicians are rapidly vanishing.  Typically, today's
manufacturer of a new drug must convince a panel of experts who
comprise a managed-care organization's formulary committee --
a discerning and informed consumer -- of the importance of the
product.  Their evidentiary criteria can exceed those of FDA and
they may call for evidence (such as pharmacoeconomics and comparative
efficacy) that is outside the sphere of the drug-approval process.
 The utilization of new (and other) drugs is becoming more tightly
controlled, and the outcomes are being recorded and analyzed in
ways that were previously inconceivable. There is, for example,
a growing use of computerized control of patient selection, indication,
dose, and duration of therapy.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Thus, manufacturers' products and claims, and
the evidence supporting them, must meet very high standards to
be accepted in today's marketplace.  In this exacting environment,
government regulation of the product-development process should
not add burdens that are no longer necessary.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >One fundamental cause of the ever-increasing
regulatory burden in the United States is  that regulators strive
to avoid, at any cost, approving a product that might turn out
to be harmful, even if this policy causes them inevitably and
systematically to delay or neglect to approve products that promote
patients' well-being.  Consequently, FDA has continually imposed
new requirements and assumed new regulatory responsibilities that
have inexorably increased the length of the approval process and
the costs involved.  Because this phenomenon goes to the fundamental
malaise of FDA's monopoly over drug evaluation and review, it
is worth exploring further. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >There exists a marked asymmetry, or imbalance,
between the two kinds of wrong decisions that a regulator can
make: (1) a decision to approve for marketing a drug or other
product that turns out to be harmful (an &quot;error of commission&quot;),
or (2) a decision to deny, delay or inhibit approval of a drug
or other product that would be beneficial (an &quot;error of omission&quot;).
 Putting this another way, it is the difference is between permitting
something bad to happen and not permitting something beneficial
to happen.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Several kinds of asymmetry exist in the two
situations.  Two classic examples of errors of commission are
the approval of the tranquilizer thalidomide by some European
regulatory agencies in the 1960's and the approval of the &quot;swine
flu&quot; vaccine by FDA.  Mistakes like these are highly visible.
 They bring down the wrath of the media, the public, and legislative
oversight bodies.  Often both the developers of the drug and the
regulators who allowed it to be marketed are criticized and punished
-- witness the modern-day pillories in Congressional oversight
hearings and the press.  A regulator's career might be damaged
irreparably by the good-faith but mistaken approval of a product.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Errors of omission, in the form of unreasonable
demands or requirements, can delay or prevent entirely the marketing
of an important new product.  But such errors of omission caused
by regulators' bad judgments, timidity or anxiety is often known
only to a few knowledgeable company and FDA insiders.  And if
the mistake precipitates a company's decision to abandon the drug,
both the regulatory misstep and the sequelae may be largely invisible.
 Moreover, there may be no direct evidence that the continuing
suffering of patients is avoidable -- or that the regulators are
culpable.  Too often FDA is allowed to &quot;err on the side of
safety,&quot; when that is merely a euphemism for committing an
error of  &quot;ommission.&quot; <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The changes in regulations proposed here are
intended, in part, to improve the balance between benefit and
risk, and between safety considered narrowly and patients' overall
welfare.  The plan will shift the balance toward encouraging product
development and permitting patients greater and timelier access
to the benefits of innovation.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT >Positive Features of the U.S. System of
 Drug Development and Regulation</FONT></B>

<P>
<FONT >In proposing reform, it is important to understand
and preserve the virtues of the present system.  Industry, government,
academia, and medical practice all play a role in the scheme of
drug development, regulation, and use in this country.  This system
has substantially achieved two major goals: <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >1) protection of human subjects of clinical
research (through the IND process); and,</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >2) assurance that no product reaches the market
until proved reasonably safe and effective for its labeled use
(through the NDA process).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The major regulatory requirements governing
this process were instituted in 1962.  Over the past 35 years,
students of U.S. regulation have learned a great deal about the
nuances of the regulatory system and of FDA itself, including
which aspects work well and which need to be improved.   It should
be noted, however, that drug regulation, while important, is only
one of many important contributing factors in bringing new therapies
to patients.  Profound changes have occurred over the past three
decades in widely disparate parts of the system and in society.
Clinical research has advanced. The media has become more aggressive
and covered these subjects more fully.  Public sophistication
and awareness has grown.  Pharmaceutical marketing, tort case
law, and -- perhaps most important and powerful now and for the
foreseeable future -- the system of paying for medical treatments
have all changed dramatically.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Clinical research, for example, has many more
professional, full-time, career clinical researchers (including
MD/PhDs) than it did in 1962.  Since 1962, we have also seen the
advent of institutional safeguards, such as Institutional Review
Boards (IRBs).  Corporate operating procedures have been systematized,
as have corporate and government clinical-safety reporting and
analysis procedures. There is the new science of pharmacoepidemiology,
and innovations in patient care, such as skilled clinical research
nursing at research institutions, have provided yet another level
of expertise applied to clinical research. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In addition, various entities have become <I>de
facto</I> standard-setting organizations.  The newest ones, which
are rapidly becoming the most powerful, are managed-care organizations.
 As described above, these organizations exercise influence through
large-scale purchasing, control over their formularies, and drug
utilization review.  Formularies and drug utilization-review are
particularly powerful; physicians practicing within organizations
like HMOs are seeing their ability to prescribe increasingly constrained
or &quot;corrected&quot; by computerized &quot;governors,&quot;
in systems that perform overall integration of the medical record
for case management.  A physician might be prevented from prescribing
a drug if according to software filters it does not fit a patient's
listed diagnosis, or is excessive in dose or time of administration.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >While drug regulation has played a major role
in the elevation of standards to their present levels, these other
factors are essential and autonomous components that exist outside
FDA's  realm.  They are virtually independent, non-governmental
instruments that help to maintain research integrity, drug safety
and efficacy, and post-marketing surveillance.  Furthermore, FDA
is by no means the only world body that regulates drug approval
for safety and efficacy: a score of other countries (and now the
EU) have systems that perform reviews and achieve results that
are essentially similar to those of the United States -- and incidentally,
operate with staffs and budgets disproportionately smaller than
the FDA.  Indeed, as drugs become increasingly subject to these
various new controls before and after marketing approval, the
relative importance of FDA as a protector inevitably diminishes.
 This evolution must shape the reform of pharmaceutical regulation.
A regulatory system for the 21st century has to be different from
one crafted in 1962 when the problems were very different, and
the other elements of <I>de facto</I> regulation were almost non-existent.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT >The History of Regulatory Reform<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT >FDA is responsible for regulating the testing
and marketing of all new human and veterinary drugs.  FDA's basic
authority is embodied in the 1902 Public Health Service Act; the
1938 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; and 1962 amendments
to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. The Public Health Service
Act mandates the <I>safety </I>regulation of biological drugs.
 The 1938 Act charged FDA with ensuring the <I>safety</I> of all
new drugs before they are released to the market (the NDA approval
process).  In 1962, partly in response to the thalidomide tragedy
in Europe, Congress imposed the additional requirement that a
new drug be shown to be <I>effective</I> as well as safe.  The
amendments also expanded the government's authority to regulate
clinical investigations of drugs (the IND process). Today all
preclinical and clinical research is conducted under FDA regulations
and policies.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >It is striking that for decades, debates about
regulatory reform have identified the same problems and the same
solutions have been recommended by panel after distinguished panel.
These eminent and expert panels, including the McMahon Committee,
the Lasagna Committee, the Edwards Committee, and the Council
on Competitiveness have recommended both broad changes and specific
improvements that would reduce the time, cost, complexity, and
unpredictability of the process, and thereby prevent the loss
of potential therapies.  Because the agency has been too slow
and obdurate in implementing most of these repeated recommendations,
reform must come from outside the agency, via legislative changes.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > </FONT>
<P>
<FONT >A particular advantage of our proposal (to
be described in Section II) is that delegating a portion of the
oversight responsibility to non-governmental entities introduces
two basic improvements simultaneously: (i) an element of competition
among DCBs for drug companies' business, which creates pressure
for greater creativity and efficiency; and (ii) a more appropriate
balance between risks and rewards, incentives and disincentives
than presently exists.  These basic elements derive from first
principles of management and regulation.  The proposed mechanism
also contains safeguards to assure the integrity of the process,
including high-quality reviews.<BR>

<h3>THE PROPOSED NEW SYSTEM:  REGULATION
OF DRUGS AND BIOLOGICS</h3>
<BR>
<FONT >The goal of the plan is to speed the delivery
of safe and effective products to patients who require them. 
To achieve that, changes in current federal regulation are proposed
that will facilitate early clinical research; increase the efficiency
of drug development and the constructiveness of its regulatory
oversight; and reduce the overall time and cost required for a
new drug to reach the market.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > </FONT>
<P>
<FONT >While improving the process for developing,
reviewing, and approving new drugs and biologics, this proposal
maintains existing safety and effectiveness standards by preserving
the legal requirements for pre-market demonstration of safety
and effectiveness.  Preserved as well are FDA's enforcement powers
and the agency's final sign-off authority to approve product marketing.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The salient aspects of this proposal are the
transfer of much of the responsibility for day- to-day IND oversight
and NDA review to non-governmental experts; support of the review
mechanism (DCBs) by user fees (via contractual arrangements between
sponsors and DCBs); and competition among the non-governmental
entities that will oversee the IND process and perform reviews.
 No single component of this proposal is completely new, but the
integration of these various elements into a drug oversight and
review system is accomplished in a novel way that is both logically
sound and empirically validated.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Our plan proposes changing the system of regulatory
oversight of drug development by transferring the primary oversight
responsibility (but not the final approval step) from FDA to non-governmental
entities, Drug Certification Bodies (DCBs),that are staffed by
the experts that the law requires to make judgments on effectiveness
and safety.  This transformation of the IND oversight and NDA
review process for  individual products in development will be
more comprehensive than other, similar proposals that would, for
example, delegate piecemeal various FDA functions such as review
of NDA filings.  Competition among the DCBs to provide regulatory
oversight services, combined with safeguards against conflicts
of interest and overeagerness to approve products, will create
a more efficient drug development process and promote innovation.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT >The Drug Certification Bodies (DCBs)</b>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >DCBs will be certified by FDA to ensure they
have the technical, scientific, and managerial expertise necessary
to oversee and review particular specialties or categories of
products.  The DCBs' own imperatives to compete for clients, avoid
tort liability, and retain FDA certification are the fundamental
triad that will provide the impetus for high standards.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The corporate structure, geographic location,
and number of DCBs will be determined by market forces, as will
how many DCBs emerge and survive.  DCBs may choose, for example,
to be for-profit or non-profit; to be physically located in existing
centers of medical research or near centers of the pharmaceutical
or biotechnology industry; and to specialize in particular therapeutic
areas or drug types, or be  broadly qualified for a wide range.
 The regulatory process for obtaining licensure as a DCB could
be modeled on other complex health-related licensing procedures
such as the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations
(JCAHO).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >FDA will certify the DCBs to oversee most of
the drug development process (i.e., to evaluate and issue INDs),
oversee drugs in development, and review NDA applications.<sup><a href="foot.html">3</a></sup><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >At the sponsor's option, the DCB may offer
advice on what is appropriate or required in a development program
to obtain NDA approval, but ultimate approval cannot (and should
not) be guaranteed. Nor should this be part of the contract. In
the end, the results of the physico-chemical, pre-clinical, and
clinical studies will provide evidence of safety and efficacy
-- and, therefore, an indication of likely approval. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Initially, DCBs will likely recruit from FDA,
industry, and contract research organizations (CROs) the scientific,
medical, and regulatory experts required for judgments on safety
and effectiveness. Experts may be needed in fields such as pharmaceutical
toxicology, pharmaceutical formulations, biopharmaceutics, drug
study design and analysis, clinical monitoring of therapeutics
and quality assurance, chemistry, and manufacturing.<B> </B> Because
these are specialized technical undertakings, the DCB will need
a broad range of scientific, medical, regulatory, and management
expertise. For this reason alone, qualifying for and retaining
FDA certification will be challenging.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT >The Sponsor's Relationship with a DCB</b>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The product sponsor (usually a company) will
select a DCB from those certified for the respective product class
-- categories might include, for example, anti-hypertensive drugs,
psychotropic drugs, or vaccines.  Important factors in that choice
will include the perceived ability of the DCB to oversee a suitable
NDA program and the likelihood of a successful DCB review and
eventual FDA approval for its particular product.  Other factors
influencing the choice might include the DCB's geographic location;
reputation for service; experience with studies of comparable
size and complexity; and, fees.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Different sponsor companies will require widely
different degrees of interaction and service from DCBs, as happens
now with sponsor-FDA interactions.  Sponsor-DCB contracts will
reflect these differing needs.  The level of service required
will depend on factors such as the size and previous experience
of the sponsor (both generally and for the particular class of
drug); the intrinsic novelty of the product; the presence of difficult
issues of purity, potency, stability, or toxicity; and the size
and complexity of the clinical program.  Other issues will sometimes
be prominent; for example, in the case of important public health
products such as influenza vaccine, there could be a compelling
need for extremely rapid testing and approval. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The needs of the sponsor companies will determine
how many DCBs can ultimately be sustained by the U.S. drug development
process, and what their special features and location will be.
 <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT >Role of DCB in IND Oversight and NDA Review</B>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Because the DCB will have primary supervision
over the IND, the IND submission will be made to the DCB, not
to FDA.  However, FDA will maintain its role in the national surveillance
of clinical safety of investigational drugs, as part of its responsibility
for all drug safety surveillance, as described below.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The contact between the sponsor and the DCB
will normally begin during preclinical development, well before
the expected start of clinical trials, just as sponsor-FDA interaction
often does now.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The DCB will advise on and evaluate the IND
filing and issue the IND when it is satisfied that the risk/benefit
considerations are appropriate for the commencement of  clinical
trials.  Following the granting of the IND and the IRB's (independent)
approval, the sponsor will be able to initiate the study, as at
present.  The DCB's close involvement with the sponsor will encourage
the identification and solution of problems during the pre-submission
period.  Little or no additional time -- the current 30-day waiting
period, for example -- should be needed to obtain IND approval.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The DCB will oversee the testing of the new
drug throughout its clinical research phases, concentrating on
issues of safety and efficacy.  The DCB will ensure that the sponsor
is in compliance with the currently applicable regulatory standards
(including GLPs, GCPs, and GMPs). The DCB will be responsible
for auditing the sponsor to ensure that standards have been met
in all areas and for certifying this compliance.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Once the sponsor and DCB have agreed that the
accumulated data on a product fulfill the legal requirement for
safety and efficacy, the sponsor will submit its formal New Drug
Application (NDA) to the DCB.  The DCB will be responsible for
certifying, through its regular site visits and audits of the
sponsor, that the original data are accurately recorded, analyzed,
and reported; that the data are suitably archived for future audits
if necessary; and, that the summary analyses and reports accurately
reflect the data.  The criteria for approval of the NDA will remain,
as they are now, safety and efficacy, as judged by experts (in
this case, the DCB's experts), according to the law.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Because of the DCB's continuous involvement
as the data supporting the NDA are accumulated -- a process that
has in past reform proposals been referred to as a &quot;developing&quot;
or &quot;self-reviewing&quot; NDA -- the evaluation and review
of a straightforward NDA will normally be completed rapidly after
its submission.  Also, because the DCB's report, like the NDA
itself, may be written as the NDA data are emerging, even difficult
issues to be addressed in the report -- such as marginal efficacy;
low therapeutic index; or problems with safety, stability, or
manufacturing -- will often have been identified and solved by
the DCB in the course of the IND.  Thus, a DCB's favorable recommendation
may often be issued with only a minimal additional &quot;NDA review
period.&quot;  Thus, the system will encourage a high level of
problem-solving, as the market learns to favor those DCBs that
offer competence, predictability, and a reputation for high standards.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The DCB's recommendation to the FDA for approval
of the NDA will summarize the evidence supporting a positive recommendation,
similar to (but with more detail than) the current Summary Basis
of Approval (SBA).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT >Role of the FDA in IND Oversight and NDA
Evaluation</B>
</FONT><P>
<FONT >FDA will be responsible for certifying DCBs
and for overarching safety concerns.  The agency will not be involved
in individual IND programs unless there is a specific safety issue
that cannot be handled through the normal oversight of the sponsor
by a competent DCB.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >On safety matters, the DCB will oversee the
sponsor, but FDA will retain its responsibilities for national
oversight of safety matters, particularly those that involve information
outside the level of the individual drug, sponsor, or DCB, as
described in Section E, below. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >FDA will devote more attention than it does
now to clarifying, updating, and making public the criteria for
NDA approval in all therapeutic areas and indications.  As new
therapies and indications arise and as the old ones evolve, FDA
will participate in public forums with sponsors and DCBs to establish
new criteria or modify existing ones.  The goal of this important,
ongoing interaction among FDA, sponsors, and DCBs is to establish
and publicize the objective criteria for approval, and also to
foster a cooperative interaction among the parties.  The existence
of up-to-date, objective criteria will promote consistency between
DCBs for similar products.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >During the evolution of the IND and NDA evaluation
and approval, FDA will not normally be exposed to the developing
project in any detail (except for major or unexpected Adverse
Drug Events (ADEs, see below)).  However, the agency will be kept
apprised of which drugs are being studied through periodic reports
from the DCBs.  These reports also will include information needed
to monitor safety information and allow general oversight, such
as: INDs issued (name of drug and sponsor); ADEs; and milestones
(dates and numbers of patients in the clinical development phases,
for instance).  During the IND phase, FDA will not routinely have
contact with the sponsor, but may at any time inspect or audit
the sponsor, DCB, or any other component of the drug-development
apparatus.  An FDA inspection might be triggered, for example,
by a suspected problem involving safety that has been inadequately
addressed, or information that raises concerns about the integrity
of data from an investigator or institution. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Once the NDA has been sent to FDA with the
DCB's recommendation for approval, the agency has a fixed period,
for example 90 days, to review the recommendation.  During this
90-day period, the Commissioner can approve the drug or reject
the NDA for a specified cause (which, in effect, rebuts the &quot;rebuttable
presumption&quot; of the DCB's recommendation). The 90-day period
of review is not extendable and the Commissioner's failure to
act during this period is deemed to be assent to the drug's approval.
 If the NDA is rejected, the DCB or the sponsor can appeal the
decision (a process which in turn must be completed in a further
90 days). The appeal mechanism is described below.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT >Clinical Drug Safety Oversight During the
IND</B></b>
<P>
<FONT >Safety oversight is largely unchanged in our
reform initiative.  We propose to keep intact the present national
system of pharmacovigilance administered by FDA, above the level
of the DCB. The current requirements and schedules for submitting
expedited and periodic safety reports will be maintained.  Under
the new system, reports will be submitted by the sponsor to the
DCB, which will transmit reportable ADEs to FDA.  FDA communications
(including any alerts based on safety data received by FDA from
U.S. or international sources) will be made to the DCB with a
copy to the sponsor.  In this way, the DCB will continue to have
primary oversight of the sponsor's handling of safety issues,
while FDA will maintain a broad purview.  In addition, FDA will
be able to obtain the safety data necessary for compliance with
international agreements on the reporting of safety data.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >To aid FDA's safety oversight, as already described,
the DCB will inform FDA periodically of the status of the INDs
it is overseeing.  The objective of these reports is primarily
to provide FDA with information necessary for its oversight of
the safety of human subjects -- not to allow the agency to create
an active or primary role for itself in the routine oversight
of clinical programs.  (A secondary objective is to permit FDA
to plan its review of DCB recommendations.)  It is expected that
most issues that arise in the course of drug development will
be resolved by sponsor-DCB interactions without involving FDA.
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<b><FONT >Status of the Regulations Implementing the
Law</b></b>
<P>
<u>Safety and Effectiveness</u> 
<FONT >Currently, a drug's sponsor must demonstrate
its safety and effectiveness through controlled clinical tests
that are themselves closely regulated by FDA.  Before a new drug
can be marketed, FDA must determine that -- based on the data
submitted -- the drug is effective and reasonably safe for use
under the drug's labeling. It is important to note that Congress
did not create exact definitions of what is meant by &quot;effectiveness&quot;
or &quot;safety,&quot; and that the law does not supply such definitions.
 Rather, the law provides for these judgments to be made by <I>experts</I>
&quot;qualified by scientific training and experience.&quot; 
Nowhere is it specified that such experts should be exclusively
FDA employees, although that is how the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act has come to be interpreted.  This interpretation is, in effect,
just a custom that the FDA has imposed and the industry has come
to accept, even though it was not the intent of Congress as expressed
in the law; in fact, this interpretation goes beyond the letter
of the statutes.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Our proposal for reform conforms more closely,
we believe, to the original intent of the existing statutes and
regulations governing safety and effectiveness.  Some proposed
changes, such as the identity and location of the &quot;experts&quot;
required by law, will prevent the statute from being distorted
or over-interpreted.  No change is proposed in the existing legal
standard for premarket approval, which requires evidence of safety
and substantial evidence of effectiveness derived from adequate
and well-controlled investigations as evaluated by experts qualified
by scientific training and experience.  The DCB experts' recommendation
that a drug should be approved will be, in legal terms, a rebuttable
presumption that the drug meets the law's safety and effectiveness
requirements.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<U><FONT >The Regulations That Implement the Law<U><P>

<FONT >We believe that the current set of regulations
that implement FDA's enabling statutes, and the agency's interpretations
of them, are in many places unnecessarily complex and extend beyond
what the law -- and scientific principles -- require.  These can
and should be simplified, to be made more consistent with the
intent of the law.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >  </FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In order to provide for an orderly transition
to the new system and to maintain consistency with internationally
harmonized formats, the current regulations will initially be
retained.  However, as experience is gained with the new system
during the transition period, a standing committee with representatives
from FDA, sponsors, and DCBs will revise and simplify the regulations
in order to streamline the IND/NDA process while keeping it consistent
with the requirements of the law.  Such revised regulations could
be converted to a status in which adherence to them by a sponsor
would be sufficient, but not necessary, to meet legal requirements.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >As discussed above, there must be ready access
to up-to-date standards of evidence needed for NDA approval. 
For the proposed system to work effectively, FDA, working cooperatively
with DCBs and sponsors, will continue to produce and update the
standards that apply.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT >The Appeals Process</B><P></b>
<FONT >Two major problems have systematically prevented
industry from voicing complaints about the process or content
of FDA's decisions.  First, there has been no venue of independent
appeal for a party with a valid complaint; and second, there has
been a justified fear of agency reprisals.  Although there is
an FDA ombudsman, he currently reports to the Commissioner. Some
would look to the FDA advisory committees, but they are selected
and managed by FDA and address only issues presented to them by
FDA staff. There is no independent forum.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Our proposal creates an appeal mechanism for
DCB-FDA disagreements on product approval  -- an independent,
standing advisory committee of experts, the Committee on Medicines
Oversight, at the level of the office of the Secretary of the
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  It will have approximately
10-15 distinguished members representing patients, medical practice
and medical science, and the drug and device industries.  The
members of the committee will represent a wide spectrum of scientific,
medical, and regulatory expertise, and ad hoc members can be invited
as necessary.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The committee will hear appeals of FDA rejections
of a DCB recommendation, and will advise the Secretary, who will
instruct the Commissioner on the committee's decision.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT >Facilitating U.S. Approval of New Drugs
Approved Abroad</FONT></B></b>
<P>
<FONT >The efforts at international harmonization
of drug-approval standards and registration packages among advanced
countries implies that, in the future, other countries' evaluations
may not need to be completely duplicated in the United States.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >We propose to allow the direct submission to
FDA of an approved registration package from Europe (the European
Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA) or certain national regulatory
agencies, such as Great Britain's Medicines Control Agency). 
A foreign agency would function like a domestic DCB in that it
would submit summaries of the data on which its approval was based,
and the 90-day time period would apply for FDA to review and approve
or reject this package for the United States.  Alternatively,
the sponsor of a drug that had obtained (or was en route to) foreign
approval could contract with a U.S. DCB to review and submit its
NDA.<BR>

<h3>ACHIEVING THE GOALS OF REFORM</h3>
<P>
This
proposal outlines necessary reforms in the system of new drug
approval. It takes into account the need for high standards of
public safety and also the often-ignored need of patients to have
access to beneficial, sometimes potentially life-saving, new therapies.
It preserves some of the salient features of the present system,
and changes those that have become inefficient and unnecessarily
burdensome. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The existing system 1962 and, resistant to
reform, has become more complex and troubled over time.  Fundamental
changes have taken place in government, industry, and society
that call for a new, less antagonistic and monopolistic system
that fosters innovation, without sacrificing safety.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >At present, approximately 85 percent of New
Drug Applications are ultimately approved. However, given the
staggering costs and the length of time invested in drug development,
that 15 percent failure rate is extremely costly.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >This proposal offers a constructive approach
to responsible and responsive regulation.  While retaining responsibility
for the oversight of safety, the FDA sheds its day-to-day involvement
with the development of specific new drugs, leaving that to government-certified
organizations, the DCBs.  The new role for FDA emphasizes clarifying
and developing criteria for various categories of new drugs; monitoring
the DCBs; and working with the DCBs to eliminate wasted effort
and assure that when the recommendation for approval of a drug
is made to FDA, the agency will be able to approve it.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Under the proposed system, the spur to greater
efficiency and cost-effectiveness will be competition among the
DCBs, which will affect both the tactics and the strategy of drug
development and approval.  DCBs competition for sponsor-clients
will favor those that perform effective problem-solving for the
client, manage the oversight and review efficiently, and perform
reviews in a timely way.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Economic pressures will encourage the DCBs
to be competent and timely, and to cultivate a reputation for
integrity, because these traits will be most highly prized by
clients.  The enormous complexity and myriad alternatives at various
steps in the drug development process provide the DCB opportunities
to add value to the client's product.  Putting this another way,
just in the realm of clinical trials the choice of endpoints,
indications, and trial design strongly influences the size, time
and cost of development programs; therefore, there is vast potential
here for savings of time and money.  Subject to the legal standard
of safety and effectiveness, DCBs will be free to devise innovative
and more efficient ways of developing drugs and getting them approved.
  This strategic competition among DCBs and cooperation between
DCBs and sponsors will transform the drug development and approval
process and reverse the current trend of increasing time and costs.

<h3>APPENDIX:  DRUG DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATION
-- THE CURRENT SYSTEM</FONT></h3>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>How a Drug is Developed</B>
<P>
FDA does not test drugs itself.  The development
of a new drug is undertaken by a sponsor, which -- because of
the time, complexity, and costs of the process -- is almost always
a pharmaceutical company.  (Occasionally -- in about 5 percent
of approved drugs -- a federal agency, university, hospital, or
research institution may discover compounds, obtain patents, and
start development, but such entities almost never have the resources
and specialized skills to take a drug through the full development
process to obtain NDA approval themselves.) <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
Development of a new drug generally begins
with the testing of a great many chemical compounds in in-vitro
screens. (In the case of biologics, fewer substances are screened).
 Then they are screened in laboratory animals in order to determine
possible toxicity and therapeutic activity. These preclinical
investigations define the pharmacological and toxicological properties
of the agent and help to predict the initial dose range for humans.
 Many of the agents screened are eliminated from further development
at this stage, usually because they are ineffective, toxic, or
not absorbed.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
When animal studies suggest that a compound
may be therapeutically promising, the sponsor moves on to Phase
I clinical testing, which introduces the drug into humans for
the first time.  The sponsor must submit to FDA an application
called an IND (Investigational New Drug filing).  FDA has 30 days
to review the submission to ensure that the product is reasonably
safe for research in human subjects.  If FDA does not formally
object, the sponsor may begin clinical testing after the 30 days.
 Uncertainty at this stage about whether FDA will object, request
more data, or require different test procedures is highly disruptive
and has often caused U.S. companies to use more predictable locations
abroad for initial human testing.   (Currently, a significant
fraction of U.S. companies' Phase I testing is performed abroad,
mainly in Great Britain and elsewhere in Europe.  This has occurred
to such an extent that the Phase I testing industry in the United
States has collapsed; many facilities are now closed.) <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
Clinical studies are loosely divided into three
phases that represent a logical progression, or scale-up, of study
size and complexity.  Phases I and IIA, together considered to
be early clinical research, involve, respectively, the first administration
of a drug to normal human subjects and the first test of efficacy
in patients.  Phase I may involve as few as 20 subjects, and Phase
II a few dozen to a few hundred.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
Usually after early Phase II (Phase IIA), a
decision is made as to whether the drug offers sufficient promise
to warrant larger-scale (Phase IIB-III) clinical trials in order
to develop the product for marketing.  Only about a third of the
drugs that start in human testing survive to enter Phase III.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
In Phase III, research expands to examine the
following:  (i) the drug's effectiveness and side-effects in a
larger number and varied types of patients and, often, a wider
range of disease conditions (&quot;indications&quot;); (ii) the
types and incidence of side-effects; (iii) the potential for long-term
use and interactions with other drugs; and (iv) other information
useful for drug labeling. Phase III trials may involve from several
hundred to several thousand patients.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
Although Phase III trials cost more money and
take more time than any other single component of the development
process, the earlier phases -- and the effect of ponderous regulation
of them -- are perhaps even more important in determining the
time and cost of drug development.  There are high attrition rates
(failures) of drug candidates at the early stages when little
is known about them, and there are far more products under investigation
at the early stages. These facts are often overlooked, but they
underscore the key importance of obtaining greater efficiency
and cost reductions in the earlier phases of the drug development
process.  Such improvements would facilitate early decisions to
drop compounds that will ultimately fail (that is to say, the
majority), in order to focus resources on the few that will succeed.</FONT>
<P>
 </FONT>
<P>
Although the process is described in terms
of phases, development is really a continuum of research.  In
practice, the phases of drug testing are not sharply differentiated.
 Often, studies described as Phase I may have to be done or repeated
after Phase II -- or even Phase III -- has begun. For instance,
after advanced clinical testing in adults, the sponsor might seek
a pediatric indication; new Phase I and II studies might then
be needed in children.  Often, many different types of studies
are done simultaneously for different purposes; they are not neatly
divided into phases.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
The distinction between &quot;early&quot; and
&quot;later&quot; clinical research, is the junction between Phase
IIA and Phase IIB.  Through Phase IIA (sometimes called &quot;exploratory
development&quot;) researchers are looking for evidence of &quot;clinical
proof of concept,&quot; and expenditures through this point are
generally less than about $15 million per compound, most of which
fail.  After Phase IIA, drug testing enters an intense program
focused primarily on amassing evidence of efficacy for ultimate
NDA approval.  Expenditures for Phase III programs are in the
tens of millions to  hundreds of millions of dollars.  (One cardiovascular
drug reached the quarter-billion dollar mark in a multicenter
Phase III clinical trial -- and failed).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>The NDA Submission and Review Process</B>
<P>
When the pre-clinical and clinical testing
demonstrate that a drug is effective as labeled and reasonably
safe, the sponsor files a New Drug Application (or Product Licensing
Application -- PLA -- in the case of biologics) with FDA, seeking
approval to market the drug.  The NDA, which consists of many
volumes and often hundreds of thousands of pages, describes fully
the reports of all investigations and statistical analyses performed
to demonstrate the drug's safety and effectiveness.  It also includes
a description of the drug's composition, the methods, facilities,
and controls for the manufacturing, processing, and packaging
of the drug; samples of the drug and its components; and a draft
version of the proposed labeling.  NDAs are reviewed by the Office
of Drug Evaluation in FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research
(CDER), and PLAs are reviewed by the Center for Biologics Evaluation
and Research (CBER).  The reviews are performed by teams consisting
of physicians, pharmacologists, chemists, statisticians, and other
specialists.  By statute, FDA is required to approve or disapprove
an NDA within 180 days, although this rarely happens.  The 180-day
period can be extended by &quot;agreement&quot; between the sponsor
and FDA.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
Ultimately, most NDA submissions (at present
85 percent; DiMasi et al., CPT 1994, 1995) are approved by FDA,
but frequently final approval comes only after considerable time
and negotiation and requires additional submissions of data. 
Also FDA may narrow the sponsor's initial request, approving fewer
indications for the drug's use and imposing more restrictive labeling
requirements. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
After passage of the 1962 Amendments, the time
required for FDA review and approval of NDAs rose from six months
in 1962 to an average of three years in 1975 and remained there
throughout the 1970s and 1980s (ranging as high as four-year averages
at times); after years of protest by the industry and efforts
by FDA and industry, the time required has now been reduced to
two years or less.  The sharpest reduction occurred recently with
the implementation of user fees (but before most of the additional
personnel approved by PDUFA -- the User Fee Act -- had been hired
by FDA, suggesting that most of the effect was due to a management
change that could have been implemented at any time during the
preceding 25 years).  Much has been made of FDA's efforts to reduce
the time of NDA review, but even substantial reductions, while
desirable, will not greatly affect the overall 15-year total time
required for drug development and review.  Provided gross excesses
in review times do not reappear, the proper focus now should be
to reduce the time and costs of the total development and approval
cycle, and this will need more strategic attention to the endpoints
required for approval, as well as to the tactical efforts needed
to achieve them.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
Meanwhile the number of new INDs has continued
to rise, but the trickle of products approved for market that
emerge from the end of the pipeline has remained stagnant at 20
to 30 per year since the 1960s.  In 1994 the FDA approved only
22 new drugs (compared to 25 the previous year).   The numbers
of applications submitted to FDA for marketing approval of biologicals
has been declining.  Thus, the flow of products from the first
clinical trials through to ultimate marketing approval has slowed.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
These are some of the reasons that this proposal
seeks to make improvements throughout the period of regulated
clinical testing, rather than focusing predominantly on expediting
NDA review and approval.<BR>

<h2>III. Medical Devices</h2>
by Ralph A. Epstein<P>

<CENTER><B>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY<BR>
</B></CENTER>
<P>
<b>Operating Plan for a New Medical Device
Certification Process</b>
<P>
The new plan involves the interaction of three
groups: the manufacturer who bears the ultimate responsibility
for their product; a private Device Certifying Body (DCB), engaged
by the manufacturer to provide independent certification of critical
manufacturing processes and of products; and, the federal authority
(FDA), which maintains responsibility for public safety by ensuring
the competence of the DCB's, keeping the system honest by enforcing
compliance with law, and by maintaining a universal system of
postmarketing surveillance. The system is characterized by the
reliance on objectively defined law, clear standards and well-defined
responsibility. It relies, as far as possible, on private, non-governmental,
organizations. The plan follows in most details the workings of
the European Union medical device regulatory system.<BR>

<P>
<b>Basic Principles</b>
<P>
All medical devices are classified, using clear
objective criteria, into one of four classes (I, IIa, IIb, and
III). Devices presenting the highest level of risk and complexity
are placed in the higher numbered classes. Devices may be marketed
only if they conform with a comprehensive series of &quot;essential
requirements.&quot; As far as possible, such conformance will
be ensured in practice by adhering to relevant internationally
agreed upon objective standards. For all classes of devices, except
Class I, a DCB must audit the manufacturer periodically to confirm
such conformance. The number of areas audited and the stringency
of the audit depends on the class. However, in all cases, the
manufacturer has a choice of methods to demonstrate conformance.
In general, the manufacturer can either demonstrate conformance
of his quality assurance systems or conformance of the product
itself. Combinations of these two routes are permitted. In all
cases the manufacturer must have a system for monitoring and acting
upon reports of a device malfunction after sale. In addition,
the FDA acts as a central repository of such information when
it involves a serious threat to patient safety as it is in a position
to monitor the investigation of such events, especially when it
involves similar situations arising with several manufacturers.
The FDA may, for cause, require that a device be withdrawn from
the market if the manufacturer has not ensured that it meets the
essential requirements or if the DCB has not acted competently.
In addition, criminal charges may be brought in the case of fraud
or criminal negligence.<BR>

<P>
<b>Self-certification by Manufacturers</b>
<P>
Device innovation is often characterized by
many small incremental changes. A method of rapid certification
of new products facilitates this. For Class I devices, the manufacture
may self-certify conformance with the essential requirements.
Manufacturers who maintain a total quality assurance system may
self-certify new Class IIa and IIb products between the periodic
audits of their DCB. Class III products always require premarketing
design approval by a DCB. In addition, for Class III devices,
the FDA must be notified 90 days prior to marketing to allow time
for the FDA to elect to review the appropriateness of the certification
process.<BR>

<P>
<b>Good Manufacturing Practice Inspection</b>
<P>
The FDA's current auditing of manufacturers
for Good Manufacturing Practices would be replaced by the DCB's
certification of the manufacturer's quality assurance systems.
Such certification would often exceed FDA standards as it could
include certification of design quality assurance. It would also
be done far more frequently than current FDA inspections. <BR>

<P>
<b>Labeling and Off-Label Use</b>
<P>
Currently, a new application to the FDA is
needed whenever the manufacturer claims a new use for a device,
or even if the manufacture wishes to distribute reprints from
the scientific literature concerning a new use. This is often
so expensive and time consuming that the manufacture &quot;ignores&quot;
such clinical practice, resulting in widespread &quot;off-label&quot;
uses. In most cases, in the new system, the manufacture will be
able to self-certify such label changes (subject to the unusual
monitoring by the DCB).<BR>

<P>
<b>Timeliness of Approvals</b>
<P>
The current system has been characterized by
such slow approvals that venture capital has become scarce and
manufacturers have been forced to relocate critical operations
offshore. Approvals under the new system should be expeditious
as competitive forces will only tolerate DCB's capable of responding
to the market.<BR>

<P>
<b>International Harmonization</b>
<P>
Since the new system will be based on standards
and procedures virtually identical to those of the European Union,
it should be possible for a manufacturer to obtain both U.S. and
European approval using the same documentation and inspections.
In can be predicted that organizations will be certified both
as U.S. DCB's and European &quot;notified bodies.&quot; <BR>

<P>
<b>Transition</b>
<P>
A two to three year transition period is envisioned
so that devices under current review can be approved under the
existing system, if the manufacture should so elect. After a suitable
period, only products certified under the new system would be
allowed access to the market.

<h3>AN OVERVIEW OF THE MEDICAL DEVICE
INDUSTRY</h3>
<P>
<FONT >The medical device industry has been dominated
by the United States for many decades. American medical devices
are recognized world wide for quality and innovation. Of the approximately
50 billion dollars in United States production, 20 percent is
for the export market, producing a positive balance of payments.
Nevertheless, the industry's competitive position is very fragile
and our world leadership is now seriously threatened -- not from
external competition but from internal policy. Not only can this
have serious economic consequences, but the quality of our medical
care itself is now in jeopardy. A review of the unique circumstances
of the medical device industry, with an emphasis on the factors
which have fostered innovation, is useful in order to appreciate
how we have come to this state.<sup><a href="foot.html">1</a></sup><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In sharp contrast with the pharmaceutical industry,
the medical device industry is composed of a very large number
of quite small companies. In 1993, 88 percent of medical device
companies had less than 100 employees.<sup><a href="foot.html">2</a></sup> Although there are a few
companies with sales exceeding a billion dollars, the typical
medical device company has sales in the 50 to 100 million dollar
range. Of the over 7,000 domestic medical device manufacturers,
approximately 1,000 are development companies with no sales at
all!<sup><a href="foot.html">3</a></sup> There are only about 150 firms with sales exceeding $100
million. The very largest medical device companies have total
sales equal to that of rather small pharmaceutical companies.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >One reason device companies are small is that
the market itself is extremely fragmented. For example, the total
U.S. market for anesthesia machines of all types is only about
3,000 units a year with a total value of barely $150 million.
 In contrast, the United States market for systemic antibiotics
or antihypertensives is five <I>billion</I> dollars per year.<sup><a href="foot.html">4</a></sup>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Medical device companies aggressively pursue
research and development. In 1993, while the median R&amp;D expenditure
as a percent of sales for all manufacturing companies was 4 percent,
it was over twice as much, 9 percent, in the medical device industry.
For companies with sales in the 5 to 20 million dollar range,
it was over 20 percent.<sup><a href="foot.html">5</a></sup> Not surprisingly, a very large proportion
of significant innovation occurs in the smallest companies with
the least sales. Venture capital is generally attracted to these
companies in the expectation that the product or the company itself
will be sold to a larger company in 5 to 7 years. While radically
new technologies attract public attention, much of the long term
improvement in medical devices comes from a myriad of small incremental
innovations which cumulatively, over time, have great clinical
relevance. The FDA is required by current law to review over 6,000
applications for such &quot;new&quot; devices a year, representing
the entire range of modern technology.<sup><a href="foot.html">6</a></sup> Much of the impetus for
such product improvements comes from physicians in the field.
Unimpeded communication between physicians (and other health care
personnel) and manufacturers is a requirement for much of this
activity. Likewise the ready availability of sites for device
testing in a clinical environment, generally in our academic health
centers,  is essential for innovation.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Finally, the relatively small size of the market
for any given medical device and the need for specialized material
for many of these devices results in device companies being critically
dependent on suppliers outside the medical device industry. Thus,
the device may be dependent on a small amount of a specialized
plastic, an esoteric metal or an electronic component. The device
company seldom has the resources to develop such materials, and,
because of the small amount needed, there is little financial
incentive for the supplier to provide them. Their availability
is a byproduct of a larger, non-medical, market.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The medical device industry is thus dependent
on multiple factors beyond its direct control, and any breakdown
of these complex relationships will threaten innovation by the
industry. Time is the biggest threat. Small companies have little
reserves and are dependent on fresh infusions of capital or on
current sales (if they exist) to finance innovation. Delays, or
the fear of delays, or even the unpredictability of delays, can
lead to financial disaster and frighten off venture capital. Such
delays can be related to the time required by the FDA to approve
clinical trials or to approve the device itself, among many other
causes. The delays interact. Thus increased FDA requirements for
human investigations, as the FDA attempts ever more to force the
device industry into a pharmaceutical regulatory model,<sup><a href="foot.html">7</a></sup> make the
system more sensitive to delays in approvals of such investigations.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >There are other delays in a new product's revenue
stream, not directly related to the FDA, that are very hazardous,
particularly to small companies. Since many innovations are incremental,
it is often good medical practice to use the device for routine
patient care while it is still the subject of human investigation.
If the investigational nature of a device prevents payment for
the device by government or private payers, the financial integrity
of the company may be threatened. Furthermore, if such use threatens
payment for any associated hospital or physician care, the health
care facility and physician may find it impractical to continue
interacting with the manufacturer, destroying a relationship needed
for continued product improvement. Finally, as U.S. academic health
centers come under more financial pressure, the opportunities
for clinical investigations decrease. The result of these forces,
coupled with FDA delays in approval of clinical investigation
protocols, has become  a potent incentive for American companiesto transfer some or all of their advanced research and development
offshore.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The product liability environment further discourages
innovation. First, many companies simply will not support the
development of new products in those areas of medicine most subject
to product liability suits, such as contraception and implantables,
as well as in entire medical specialties, such as anesthesia.
Where there were once many companies competing in the anesthesia
machine field, there are now only two significant U.S. based companies,
both of which are highly dependent on the export market. If, as
is the case, companies are liable under the doctrine of strict
liability (i.e., for any harmful event) rather than for actual
negligence, many companies will avoid intrinsically high risk
areas of medicine. The problem is compounded by the prevailing
doctrine of joint and several liability. Even if a company's actions
are only slightly related to an injury, it can be held liable
for the entire cost, if others sharing the liability have inadequate
assets. For this reason, a company producing a high-tech material,
(e.g., a plastic), which is used mostly for non-medical products,
has a huge incentive to prevent medical device companies from
having access to the material. The potential profit from the sale
of a small quantity for medical use is far less than the potential
liability or even the costs of litigation.<sup><a href="foot.html">8</a></sup><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Finally, third party payers are limiting the
technology for which they will pay. To survive in a managed care
environment, the industry must have the flexibility to turn its
innovative energies to developing products which, if they do not
dramatically improve health care, lower its costs.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT > </FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Currently, innovation is threatened by all
these factors simultaneously. The industry is over-regulated and
preyed upon by the plaintiffs' bar. Hobbled by these forces, it
is threatened by a new payor environment which has redefined what
sort of innovation is valued. The result in the last several years,
has been a decrease in the availability of venture capital; a
decrease in new product introduction in the United States; a trend
toward moving research and development as well as some manufacturing
to Europe; a decrease in the traditional growth of employment
opportunities in the United States; and, ultimately a delay in
the availability of medical technology needed by American patients.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Current market forces seeking to rationalize
health care costs should, if anything, provide new opportunities
for innovation in all areas of medicine, including medical devices.
Innovation would simply become more related to optimizing the
relationship of benefit to cost. Innovations in medical technology
can just as easily decrease as increase costs. The current revolution
in minimally invasive surgery and the consequent decrease in hospitalization
and time for recuperation is just one example of the potential
for technology to significantly decrease costs. Such market forces
are simply part of the environment that normally modulates the
growth and direction of an industry. Government regulation has
the perverse effect of constraining industry from rapidly adapting
to this changing environment.<BR>

<h3>DEVELOPMENT OF REGULATION OF THE
MEDICAL DEVICE INDUSTRY</h3>
<P>
<FONT >Close government regulation of the medical
device industry is a relatively recent phenomenon in western democracies.
In the United States, there was little regulation before 1976
aside from laws that ensured that devices performed in accordance
with their labeling<sup><a href="foot.html">9</a></sup>. In Western Europe, regulation varied from
country to country. There was little direct governmental regulation
in some countries, such as Great Britain. Even in those European
countries with a long history of regulation, such as Germany,
regulations existed largely to ensure that manufacturers met standards
which had been approved by a consensus of the relevant manufacturers
and users.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >All this radically changed in the United States
with the passage of the 1976 Medical Device Amendments to the
Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. The law first provided for <I>general
controls</I> which would apply to all devices. This included control
of labeling (and, by extension, advertising and all other communication
between manufacturers and users) and manufacturing (and, by extension,
design) practices (GMP's- good manufacturing practices). Devices
whose safety could be assured by general controls alone were to
be placed in Class 1. The law envisioned that the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) would devise a process to approve many hundreds
of <I>performance standards</I>. Devices whose safety could be
assured by their also adhering to such performance standards were
to be placed in Class 2. Finally, Class 3 was reserved for those
few devices which would require a case by case prospective analysis,
as their complexity precluded assurance of safety by adherence
to performance standards and general controls alone. A manufacturer
wishing to market a Class 2 device needed only to notify the FDA
90 days in advance of its intention to sell the device and document
that it met the relevant performance standards. Marketing was
permitted if the FDA did not formally object in this time frame.
Only Class 3 devices required explicit premarket approval. The
premarket approval (PMA) application was to be acted on by the
FDA in no more than 180 days.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >All existing devices (preamendment devices)
were to be temporarily approved and placed, by category, into
one of the three classes, as determined by broadly based panels.
Section 510(k) of the law allowed the manufacturer to petition
the FDA to approve a new device that was &quot;substantially equivalent&quot;
to a device manufactured before 1976 and place it into the same
class as the predicate device. It was permitted to demonstrate
that a new device was substantially equivalent to a postamendment
device which in turn was substantially equivalent to a preamendment
device. At some future date, Class 3 preamendment devices and
new devices which were approved under section 510(k) as being
<I>substantially</I> <I>equivalent</I> to Class 3 preamendment
devices were to be subject to a PMA.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Finally, new devices which were not substantially
equivalent to a preamendment device were automatically placed
in Class 3 (thus requiring premarket approval through a PMA process).
There was provision in the law for reclassification to a lower
class if it could be shown that compliance with general controls
alone, or general controls and performance standards, could ensure
safety.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The intent of this somewhat convoluted scheme
was to exercise no more governmental control than appeared necessary
and to avoid delays in introducing useful products to the market.
In fact, in the early years of device regulation, expeditious
approval was the rule.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >However, the system contained the seeds of
its own destruction. Congress and the FDA grossly underestimated
the complexity of the very heterogeneous medical device industry.
Although the formulation and approval of performance standards
were the foundation of the classification system and thus the
heart of the regulations, the FDA approved virtually no performance
standards. The reclassification process for new devices proved
so cumbersome that the FDA essentially did not implement it. 
Although Congress had provided no guidance as to how to determine
&quot;substantial equivalence,&quot; the 510(k) process was heavily
relied upon and the FDA made every effort to stretch the law to
the breaking point and accept claims of substantial equivalence
in order to allow manufactures to bring devices to the market
quickly and predictably. The FDA apparently gave little or no
thought of ever requiring PMA's for preamendment devices. In summary,
the law was &quot;working&quot; because FDA did not implement
it as written<sup><a href="foot.html">10</a></sup>.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The dissociation between the law as written
and as applied became more and more apparent throughout the 1980's,
resulting in major investigations of the FDA by congressional
oversight committees, the General Accounting Office and the Office
of Technology Assessment<sup><a href="foot.html">11</a></sup>. With the law clearly not being implemented
literally, it was easy to reap political benefits by criticizing
the operation of the FDA. Scandals at the FDA concerning generic
drugs compounded the problem and the prestige of the agency fell.
The FDA became more cautious, approval times began to lengthen
and enforcement began to take on an arbitrary character. However,
the 1976 statute, even though it was often vague and incomplete,
precluded serious governmental abuse. By 1990, Congress was ready
to act. It appears that the possibly of deregulation was not considered.
Instead, the Safe Medical Device Act of 1990 vastly increased
the power of the FDA over the device industry.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Several aspects of the 1990 act require comment.
The FDA was granted the authority to impose large civil penalties.
The act required postmarket reporting by users, distributors,
importers and manufacturers of device failures which did or might
cause harm. This requirement for redundant reporting of even the
suspicion of device failure resulted in the FDA being inundated
by more data than it could analyze or even catalog, especially
as the fear of penalties created a great incentive to complete
reports of marginal events. More fundamentally, the 510(k) process
was significantly modified. No longer could a company, even in
principle, market a device 90 days after submitting a 510(k) &quot;notification&quot;
(unless the FDA formally objected). Now the company was forbidden
to market the device until it received explicit <I>premarket</I>
permission from the FDA, in the form of a formal &quot;order.&quot;
The act defined &quot;substantial equivalence&quot;, the basis
for a 510(k) decision,  very broadly and explicitly allowed a
device to be placed in Class 2 on the basis of &quot;substantial
equivalence&quot; even if it had different technological characteristics
from its predicate device. The lack of FDA approval of performance
standards to allow for an objective approval process was implicitly
acknowledged by simply no longer requiring  them. However, these
provisions, rather than liberalizing the process, further constrained
it as the FDA was given the unlimited power to devise any &quot;special
controls&quot; that it deemed necessary for Class 2 devices. The
combination of these changes effectively removed any difference
in principle between Class 2 and Class 3 devices as now premarket
approval based on the judgement of FDA reviewers, rather that
conformity with recognized standards, was needed for both.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Further medical device amendments followed
in 1992. They were for the most part technical corrections or
provided time extension for the FDA to complete previously required
work. They did not change the essential character of the power
of the FDA.<BR>

<h3>THE CURRENT STATE OF THE MEDICAL
DEVICE INDUSTRY</h3>
<P>
<FONT >After many years of healthy growth, the medical
device industry is approaching a crises. Although the difficulties
that some companies are having are the result of their inability
to adapt to the new market realities which require more cost effective
solutions, much is due to misdirected governmental policy. The
direct and indirect effects of inappropriate product liability
policies are very important but are beyond the scope of this paper.
We will concentrate here on the consequences of FDA regulation.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The time it takes to obtain FDA approval of
a new product and the perceived capriciousness of the process
is perhaps the greatest concern to industry. The 1976 law envisioned
that the 510(k) approval process should not take longer than a
total of 90 days.  It is actually quite difficult to interpret
FDA's own statistics concerning their review times. Their preference
for using median times masks the fact that the time is skewed
sharply toward long reviews. Often they cite time at the FDA rather
than total elapsed time, not counting the time the manufacturer
needs to provide additional data required by the reviewer. Finally,
the FDA may &quot;stop the clock&quot; and this may not be noted.
Although the FDA believes that only counting the time at the FDA
is &quot;fair,&quot; the essential point is that if the entire
process is slow there is a severe disincentive to the development
of products in the United States. By 1992 the <I>median</I> elapsed
time was 90 days. The median then increased to 164 days by 1993,
dropping back to 155 days by 1994.<sup><a href="foot.html">12</a></sup> However, by definition, half
the approvals take longer than the median. In 1994, 5% of the
510(k) applications were taking more than 613 days, or almost
2 years.<sup><a href="foot.html">13</a></sup>  The net result is an increase in R&amp;D costs and a
costly delay in the time needed to develop a positive cash flow.
During early 1995, it was apparent that the FDA, under extreme
political pressure from a wide variety of sources, had reassigned
resources, softened their policies and made a significant effort
to decrease review times and introduce more reason into the process.
It is difficult to predict how long this will last.  However,
it should be noted that there is now nothing in the statute that
requires or provides an incentive for  expeditious reviews<sup><a href="foot.html">14</a></sup>.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >&quot;New&quot; Class 3 devices require that
the FDA approve a PMA. The 1976 statue allowed for a 180 day period
for FDA review. In 1990, the mean total elapsed time for an FDA
decision was 609 days. By 1993 it had climbed to 823 days. This
represents an extraordinary delay and has been a principal reason
the number of PMA submissions dropped from 78 to 40 during that
period<sup><a href="foot.html">15</a></sup>.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Most PMA submissions and an increasing number
of 510(k) submissions require the generation of clinical data.
The law requires approval of clinical protocols by an Institutional
Review Board (IRB). For clinical studies posing potential hazards,
the FDA must also prospectively approve the details of the study.
There have been many anecdotal reports of long delays in such
approvals. As such clinical studies, by necessity, take place
before submission for device approval, these delays are additive
to the delays in the 510(k) and PMA approval process.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >There have been some attempts to quantify the
costs of these delays<sup><a href="foot.html">16</a></sup>. The Western European regulatory system
has been used as a benchmark. In general, our best estimate is
that European approvals require less than half the time of American
approvals. In fact, in many circumstances, European companies
which have demonstrated compliance with design and manufacturing
quality control standards can self-approve broad categories of
devices. Similarly, there is a conducive climate for clinical
investigation in many European countries. The bottom line is that
a product that might take 6 years to bring to market in the United
States might take 4 years in Europe. With this early introduction
in Europe, there is additionally a great competitive advantage
in other international markets. This necessarily means that, even
if a new product is eventually successful, venture capital will
be required for a longer time in this country and some foreign
markets may be entirely lost. The increased costs plus the uncertainties
of the regulatory process have resulted in a predictable decrease
in the availability of venture capital in the United States.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The more favorable regulatory climate in Western
Europe has allowed many companies to establish a positive cash
flow for new products by introducing the product in Europe before
marketing in the United States. Generally such a strategy can
be expected to save approximately two years. This implies that
American patients are often cared for with products several generations
behind those used for Europeans. This phenomenon is most apparent
in fast moving fields of medicine such as imaging and cardiology.
Recently, Medtronics, one of the largest U.S. device companies,
announced that it was transferring its entire venture group to
Europe. With an increase in clinical research in Europe along
with earlier product introductions, there will be an increased
incentive also to move manufacturing jobs<sup><a href="foot.html">17</a></sup>.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >While in the past American dominance in the
medical device industry was assured, the current outlook is far
less optimistic. Many factors had led to this dominance including
a well financed health care system, strong academic health centers,
a reasonable regulatory policy and low manufacturing costs. Of
these, our efficient manufacturing still gives us a distinct advantage.
Significant regulatory reform would go a long way to reverse the
current adverse trend.<BR>

<br>
<h3>CURRENT TRENDS IN REFORM PROPOSALS</h3>
Almost everyone in the device industry now
supports regulatory reform of one sort or another and agrees that
many areas of industry are severely constrained by excessive governmental
mandates<sup><a href="foot.html">18</a></sup>. There is widespread recognition that regulatory bodies
impose large costs in terms of increased prices and loss of desirable
employment opportunities as well as decreased opportunities for
innovation. In the medical device field, many organizations have
proposed relief from particularly burdensome regulations, often
without first seriously considering the possibility of fundamental
reform. In general, trade organizations, which primarily represent
large manufacturers, tend to shy away from fundamental reform,
while representatives of the smaller manufacturers tend to be
more willing to consider basic issues. This to be expected. Large
companies can better afford the large expensive specialized staff
needed to deal with the FDA. Furthermore, in the device industry,
small companies tend to be responsible for a disproportionate
share of significant innovation and thus are most constrained
by excessive and inappropriate regulation. Finally, burdensome
regulations may, in the short run, work to the benefit of established
firms because they make it more difficult for new, and often smaller,
manufacturers to enter the market. There are, of course, many
exceptions to these generalizations.<BR>

<P>
Current popular proposals for regulatory reform
can be conveniently divided into three categories. One group of
reform proposals is directed at ensuring that the FDA acts  expeditiously.
A second seeks to break the FDA's monopoly. Finally, there is
a host of proposals narrowly aimed at very specific regulatory
abuses.<BR>

<P>
<U>More Expeditious Review</U>
<P>
The 1976 law envisioned very rapid review of
new products. In fact it can be argued that, except for the minority
of devices in FDA Class 3, there was no <I>requirement</I> for
premarket review at all. Only notification of the intention to
market was required. In fact, over the years, there have been
attempts to obfuscate the fact that the FDA has tolerated very
long review cycles. Thus, the FDA at times has reported median
review times, effectively disregarding cases where the delays
have been very long indeed; has not counted the time taken by
manufactures to respond to sometimes inappropriate FDA questions
and requests; and, has pressured manufactures to &quot;request&quot;
that the FDA &quot;stop the clock.&quot; The delays involve much
more than new product applications and include, for example, the
entire process for appropriately reclassifying totally new products
after they have been initially placed arbitrarily in Class 3.
The problem facing reformers who attempt to address the issue
of excessive delays is what to do if, as in the past, the FDA
simply does not comply with the legally established deadlines.
One suggested approach is to not require FDA notification for
less complex devices, perhaps all of Class 1 devices and certain
designated types of Class 2 devices. Such self-certifying is very
close to analogous features in the European Union system. However,
this begs the question of responsibility for the classification
itself. In the FDA system, devices are classified in Class 1 if
&quot;general controls&quot; are sufficient to ensure safety.
Such a criterion is at best subjective and contrasts markedly
with the rather explicit and objective European system. Allowing
manufacturers to self certify Class 1 devices, without reforming
the classification system itself, might break down in practice
into endless litigation.<BR>

<P>
A second difficult issue is what to do if a
manufacturer in good faith places a device in Class 1, manufactures
and markets it and later the FDA decides that the device needs
to adhere to &quot;performance standards&quot; and thus should
have been placed in Class 2. Certainly one would not want to force
such a device off the market if there were no reason to believe
that there were an actual safety problem. Again, the fundamental
need is unambiguous up-front classification.<BR>

<P>
Finally, there have been proposals to allow
marketing of devices which have been approved by the European
Union if FDA regulatory delays exceed statutory limits. It should
be noted that many U.S. products are or will be approved for marketing
in Europe. Such a proposal is an implicit recognition of the quality
of the European system, and one might question why one should
not simply recognize European certification and allow the FDA
and the European Union to engage in jurisdictional competition.
One could also envision that a system which recognized European
approvals only after the FDA failed to act expeditiously might
well exacerbate the adversarial nature of the approval system.
<BR>

<P>
Eventual approval is not sufficient to attract
venture capital needed to develop new products if the approval
process itself is subject to capricious delays due to regulatory
uncertainty. Harmonization of American and European standards,
so that there is an objective basis for mutual recognition, is
a far better answer<sup><a href="foot.html">19</a></sup>.<BR>

<P>
<U>The FDA Monopoly</U>
<P>
A number of current proposals seek to break
the FDA monopoly by privatizing some FDA functions. The inspiration
is clearly from the European Union system where <I>competing</I>
private &quot;notified bodies&quot; certify that the manufacturer
has met the explicit requirements which justify the manufacturer
applying a CE mark (of approval) to it products. Unfortunately,
many current proposals fail to recognize that the virtue of the
European system lies in the fact that the European notified bodies
are expected to exercise independent judgement and are not merely
arms of the central governmental authority. Furthermore, to the
extent possible, their evaluations and decisions are based on
detailed published international standards. Contracting out current
FDA functions to private bodies without first rationalizing these
functions simply substitutes different organizations and different
workers. While there may be some virtue using an organization
that works more efficiently than many governmental agencies, the
more basic problem is with the process itself. Those proposals
which do not foster competition between private certifying bodies
by allowing manufacturers to choose the organization from which
to purchase certifying services would appear to offer limited
advantages.<BR>

<P>
<U>Specific Regulatory Abuses</U>
<P>
Finally, there is a whole series of miscellaneous
proposals that address specific abuses and problem areas. Some
seek to streamline programs that just do not work. This includes
the simplification of the device malfunction (vigilance) program
and the device tracking program. Others seek to eliminate programs
for which there is no logical rationale. This would include the
freeing of exports to first world countries which are perfectly
able to police their own markets. Others attack very narrow issues
which, for lack of a better term, can be classified as corrections
of abuse of power and dereliction of duty. These include attempts
to improve accountability by specifying which particular officials
can make certain decisions, mandating periodic meetings at the
manufacturer's request, requiring unequivocal classification of
a product as either a drug or a device, prohibiting the FDA from
making decisions based on cost-effectiveness, limiting the authority
of the FDA to require controlled clinical studies, prohibiting
the withholding of a classification decision based on GMP violations
and many other such important but narrow issues. While it might
be desirable to achieve immediate relief by instituting some of
these reforms, they represent an attempt to micromanage the FDA.
Without fundamental reform, they, like most well meaning efforts
at micromanagement, run the risk of exchanging of one set of problems
for another. In general, the reform effort would be better spent
seeking to change the system by going back to basic principles,
determining what is actually needed to protect patients, and devising
the most direct way of achieving this goal.<BR>

<h3>THE EU SYSTEM APPROVAL OF NEW MEDICAL
DEVICES</h3>
Much can be learned from the ongoing European
Union medical device regulatory reforms. Approval of new medical
devices in the EU is characterized by:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
1:<I> Objectivity    </I></FONT>
<P>
2: <I>Flexibility  </I></FONT>
<P>
3: <I>Timeliness</I>    </FONT>

</I></FONT>
<P>
The European Union medical device regulation
law is based on a list of &quot;Essential Requirements<sup><a href="foot.html">20</a></sup>.&quot;
These are universal requirements that apply to all devices. They
cover areas such as safe design and construction, clinical efficacy,
disclosure of residual risks, protective packaging, infection
control, compatibility with other devices, calibration and stability,
radiation protection, electrical safety, labeling, and instruction
manuals. In principle it is sufficient for the manufacturer to
rely solely on these requirements to justify putting a device
on the market. However, manufactures usually rely on published,
internationally agreed upon, standards which are specific to individual
devices or processes. For many decades, professional organizations
such as AAMI and IEEE in the United States and international standards
organizations such as ISO have brought together groups of experts
from the manufacturer, user and government sectors to develop
written standards covering a wide variety of topics. These include
very technical narrowly defined standards to ensure mechanical
compatibility, such as standards for machine screw threads; performance
standards for various materials, such as those for biocompatibility;
safety standards for the internal monitoring of life support equipment;
limits on electromagnetic radiation; as well as very broad standards
defining quality assurance for production, testing and even the
design process<sup><a href="foot.html">21</a></sup>. In the European system, such standards, originating
in various sources, are ultimately accepted by the EU's central
standards organization. While a manufacturer may choose to devise
alternate methods, adherence to such standards by the manufacturer
is presumptive evidence that the manufacturer has met the Essential
Requirements. Clearly defined standards provide objective criteria
and remove much of the uncertainty and risk in seeking approval.

</FONT>
<P>
For the large number of devices in Class I,
the manufacturer self-certifies compliance with the Essential
Requirements by preparing a prescribed Declaration of Conformity,
a technical document containing the supporting data which is available
to the authorities. Certain special processes, such as sterilization
needed for a Class I device, may require additional certification
by a notified body,<I> vide infra</I>.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<U>Notified Bodies</FONT></U>
<P>
For all other devices, the manufacturer must
engage the services of an independent &quot;test house&quot; to
audit their systems or product and certify compliance with the
Essential Requirements. These test houses, termed &quot;notified
bodies&quot; in the European system and &quot;device certification
bodies,&quot; or DCB's in our proposed reform are themselves certified
(licensed), in accordance with published standards, by governmental
authorities. In Europe, the manufacturer may engage any notified
body from any country in the European Union. In practice, many
of the notified bodies come from the long tradition of test houses
which physically test production samples. They can be thought
of as being similar to analogous firms in the United States such
as Underwriter's Laboratories. Others come from the more recent
tradition of firms that certify quality assurance systems. There
are a large number of American firms that do similar work and
certify that manufacturers of all types conform to ISO 9000 quality
assurance standards. Many of the notified bodies are licensed
in specialized areas. <I>Objectivity</I> is ensured by the heavy
reliance on published, well constructed standards for both device
classification and regulatory compliance.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
In addition to being able to choose between
compliance with published standards and devising <I>ad hoc</I>
methods of compliance with the essential requirements, manufacturers
generally have the <I>flexibility</I> to choose between two fundamentally
different methods of demonstrating compliance with the Essential
Requirements. One method involves having the notified body actually
examine or test the entire production run (or statistically valid
samples of the production run) to confirm that applicable standards
have been met. The second method involves having the notified
body certify the manufacturer's quality assurance systems. These
include systems for testing the final product, producing the product
and/or designing the product. The notified body, in many instances,
can certify that the manufacturer has sufficient quality assurance
systems in place to self-certify individual products<sup><a href="foot.html">23</a></sup>. The specific
options available to the manufacturer depend on the class of the
device. In general, the higher class devices must adhere to more
stringent regulations. Examples of allowable compliance methods
are presented in Table II.<BR>

Thus, manufacturers have the <I>flexibility</I>
to choose from a wide array of methods to comply with the device
regulations so that the process of bringing devices to the market
is facilitated. Methods may be chosen that are appropriate to
the company size, strengths and market. The result is that unnecessary
delays are avoided.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I>Timeliness</FONT></I>
of approvals is critical. One of the largest sources of complaints
concerning our current system is the time required to get through
the regulatory approval process. Although the FDA has recently
attempted to expedite the process, 510(k)s and PMA's have taken
far longer that the statutory 90 and 180 days to complete the
process. The profitability associated with bringing a new device
to the market, and thus the practicality of devoting resources
to innovation, is critically dependent on the amount of time it
takes. A delay has at least three deleterious effects. First,
more venture (or internal) capital is needed to support the product
during a prolonged development phase. Second, an income stream
needed to provide an adequate return on capital is delayed. Finally,
during the delay, competitors may become established in the market
place. The European system attacks the problem of timeliness directly
by not allowing anyone to have a monopoly on approval authority.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
A basic problem in the U.S. medical device
regulatory system is that the FDA has had a legal monopoly on
approvals and, if it takes longer than what is reasonable, the
manufacturer has no alternative options. By opening up the process
to competition and allowing the manufacturer the option of choosing
which notified body to engage, the Europeans have essentially
obviated the entire problem. In addition, for many devices, especially
when certified high level quality assurance mechanisms are in
place, the manufacturer may gain additional flexibility and save
time by being allowed to self-certify that the essential requirements
have been met. This problem with timeliness of approvals probably
has been the primary reason some of our best device companies
have shifted new product development to Europe<sup><a href="foot.html">24</a></sup>. Their goal is
to obtain expeditious approval so that they can establish an early
revenue stream so as to produce a return on their large capital
investment<sup><a href="foot.html">25</a></sup>. The Wilkerson Group<sup><a href="foot.html">26</a></sup> has complied a list of 100 devices
which are currently available in other developed nations but which
are unavailable to the American patient.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
The European system objective takes advantage
of <I>competitiveness</I> is two separate areas. First, the notified
bodies compete with each other on the basis of price, timeliness
and availability. Our DCB's will function in the same manner.
In addition, since a European manufacturer can engage a notified
body from another country (which was certified by that country's
authorities), there is also jurisdictional competition which acts
as a check on the government itself. If the United States and
the European Union were able to sufficiently harmonize their systems
so as to allow mutual recognition of device approvals, we would
be able to emulate that aspect of the European system.<BR>

<h3>A NEW REGULATORY REFORM PROPOSAL</h3>

<FONT >The FDA itself has publicized its efforts to
speed approvals and is investigating contracting out some of its
functions to non-governmental bodies. Devising a more reasonable
regulatory structure is made easier by the fact the European Union
has accomplished just that. Not only is their experience useful,
but bilateral trade would be facilitated if the system we adopt
is similar enough to theirs that device approval on both sides
of the Atlantic could be accomplished with minimal duplicative
effort and cost.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Alternative paths to reform which would simply
seek to curb the worst governmental abuses without fundamentally
changing the structure are inadequate. The basic 1976 law was
predicated on a device classification system based on performance
standards that were never developed. Approval of most new devices
was based on &quot;substantial equivalence&quot; to previously
approved devices. Not only was the meaning of &quot;substantial
equivalence&quot; never adequately defined, but the entire concept
of similarity with predicate devices must, by necessity, break
down over time as technology advances and the thread of similarity
with older devices becomes weaker. It is as if the space shuttle
was to be approved based on its substantial equivalence with an
ox cart. Finally, faced with the lack of objective criteria for
action, the FDA has become, at best, a cautious and ponderous
bureaucracy. This was predictable and no amount of cosmetic reform
will change the forces which have caused this bureaucratic evolution.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The new European Union medical device regulatory
system offers a more rational structure. The EU system has been
in full effect since 1992 for the most complex and risky medical
devices, active implantables; since the beginning of 1995 for
other medical devices; and is soon to be phased in for <I>in vitro</I>
diagnostic devices. U.S. manufactures have gained experience with
the EU system through two mechanisms. First, many U.S. companies
export to Europe and are thus fully subject to the EU system.
In response, the European notified bodies are well represented
in the United States. More fundamentally, over the years, American
professional organizations have been very active in publishing
standards which ultimately have become the international standards
that form the basis of the EU system. This includes both the thousands
of narrowly defined standards that guide details of design and
also more fundamental standards, such as the ISO 9000 series,
which form the basis of modern quality control systems. In fact
most major American medical device manufacturers either have obtained
or are in the process of obtaining ISO 9000 (series) certification.
Full ISO 9000 certification is significantly more comprehensive
than the GMP regulations currently administered by the FDA as
it includes a quality control system for the design process itself.
Full conformity with these standards, frequently reconfirmed,
allows medical device companies subject to the EU system the authority
to self-certify new products of moderate complexity. This then
allows a very rapid design-marketing cycle, so important to facilitate
the incremental nature of medical device innovation. Because of
the familiarity of American manufacturers with both the EU system
and the standards upon which it is based, it should be possible
for the United States to make a rapid transition to this more
rational and modern system of medical device approval. No doubt
there would have to be a transition period with both the old and
the new approval systems available, especially for devices already
in the approval process. In addition it would seem prudent, at
least until the new system is well established in this country
for the FDA to be notified of each DCB Class III device approval
sufficiently in advance of marketing (90 days) to allow confirmation
that the appropriate standards had been used.  Since the FDA is
a member of international standards organizations, this would
have the further advantage of providing information useful in
drafting new standards. Figures 1 and 2 compare our current approval
process and the proposed replacement approval process.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<IMG SRC="IMG00017.GIF"><IMG SRC="IMG00018.GIF"><FONT >Adapting
the EU system of device approvals essentially privatizes two important
functions of the FDA: device approvals and GMP (quality assurance)
inspections. There are other FDA functions that need to be considered.
In the EU system, the health authorities of each individual county
have five major functions. They have the responsibility and authority
to license the notified bodies. This is done in reference to internationally
agreed upon standards. Two, administer a post-marketing &quot;vigilance&quot;
system that monitors unexpected failures and adverse effects of
the products. Three, have the authority to remove products from
the market which prove to be out of conformity with the essential
requirements. Four, are responsible for controlling the safety
of human subjects in clinical investigations. Finally, they have
investigative authority and serve to keep the system honest. One
defining characteristic of the EU system is that the manufacturer,
not the government, is primarily responsible for the safety and
effectiveness of their product. The private notified body is a
check on the manufacturer and is in the tradition of a testing
laboratory. The government health authority polices the system.
Most importantly, although the manufacturer must demonstrate (to
the satisfaction of the notified body) that the device is as safe
as is practical according to the state of the art and that it
functions effectively as claimed on its labeling and in its instruction
manual, the final judgement as to relative clinical benefit and
risk is left to the practice of medicine and to those forces which
regulate it.<sup><a href="foot.html">27</a></sup><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >With a few limitations, a reformed U.S. system
should follow this outline. The FDA's current vigilance system
for medical devices is so overwhelmed with data that it has been
of little use. Since manufacturers already are required to collect
and analyze data concerning device malfunctions and adverse effects,
it would seem reasonable for the manufacturer to have the opportunity
to do the preliminary analysis and pass onto the FDA only those
reports where there is a reasonable possibility that there was
a device problem<sup><a href="foot.html">28</a></sup>. The manufacturer would, of course, have to maintain
records of all reports and their analysis for inspection by their
DCB (and in the case of concern, by the FDA). The FDA, as the
recipient of data from all manufacturers could then perform the
important function of correlating adverse reports concerning the
same type of product produced by several different manufacturers.
It also would be able to monitor individual manufacturer's response
to reports concerning their own devices. In addition the FDA would
be in a position to exchange information with the European Union
authorities. This might facilitate the handling of adverse events
that are so rare that data from multiple countries are needed.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In the United States, Institutional Review
Boards, especially those in the academic health centers, have
generally functioned well to both protect the interests of patients
and subjects and to facilitate research. However, it would be
reasonable for the FDA to function as a repository of data concerning
all adverse events during clinical investigations, as such a national
clearing house with access to data from many sites might facilitate
the early detection of rare events.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >With these few modifications, a reformed American
medical device regulatory system would closely follow the EU model.
The FDA would become a smaller, better focused organization with
many of their functions assumed by organizations in the private
sector.<BR>

<h2>IV. Regulatory Reform and Liability for Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices</h2>
by W. Kip Viscusi<P>

<CENTER><B><FONT >EXECUTIVE SUMMARY<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >Tort liability for the pharmaceutical and medical
device industry has been almost synonymous with the liability
crisis.  Notwithstanding the substantial level of government regulation
in these industries, firms have been the subject of major lines
of litigation, such as those involving DES and the Dalkon Shield.
 In terms of the total number of liability cases as well as the
share of liability costs relative to industry sales, the pharmaceutical
industry has been a major focal point of the liability burden.
 These costs have been disproportionate to the overall role of
the pharmaceutical and medical device industries in the economy,
as they have suffered in large part because their products are
intrinsically involved in life and death situations.  The result
is that these liability costs have substantially discouraged new
product innovation.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The extent of this liability is also surprising
in view of the already substantial role of government intervention
affecting pharmaceuticals and medical devices.  Pharmaceutical
products must undergo an extensive FDA review both in terms of
the character of the product and the wording of the hazard warning.
 Medical devices are also subject to Federal regulation as well
as the pre-emption provisions that should presumably limit tort
liability.  At the current time, there fails to be adequate recognition
on the part of the courts of the role played by government regulation
in insuring efficient levels of safety.  In recognition of this
government activity, this paper proposes a regulatory compliance
defense for all pharmaceutical and medical device product liability,
not simply a defense against punitive damages.  This proposal
would create a more even-handed treatment of pharmaceutical products
and medical devices.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The proposals to revamp the FDA drug and device
approval process would not limit the applicability of these proposals.
 So long as an institutional mechanism insuring an efficient level
of product safety was provided to consumers, there would be no
need to second guess these administrative reviews by the courts.
 Thus, the regulatory compliance defense would simply be a recognition
that there has already been government certification and that
the company has fulfilled its requirements with respect to the
provision of products that provide an adequate level of safety.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >A different legal issue related to the proposal
is the ultimate liability of the Dug and Device Certifying Bodies
that would work in conjunction with the FDA as part of the revised
regulatory process.  Potential liability for negligence in carrying
out its obligations or for breaking contractual obligations to
manufacturers should be permitted to promote responsible operation
of these groups.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >However, it is also essential to formalize
the current recognition by the courts that such certification
bodies should not be subject to strict liability to third parties
injured by products.  Otherwise, particularly in contexts of joint
and several liability, many quite responsible institutions would
be reluctant to enter the certification market for fear that their
very existence would be threatened by tort liability suits that
might even be completely unrelated to the manner in which they
carried out their obligations.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<CENTER><B><FONT >INTRODUCTION<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
<FONT >The pharmaceutical and medical device industries
are one of the principal targets of tort liability litigation.
 Lawsuits against the firms in their industries have long been
among the most prominent liability cases.  Moreover, if we exclude
asbestos and Agent Orange, the pharmaceutical industry has been
by far the leading industry with respect to mass toxic torts.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The prominent role of the pharmaceutical industry
and medical device industries are not a reflection of corporate
irresponsibility.  Rather, the nature of the products produced
by these industries are intrinsically involved in individual health
and in the treatment of patients, many of whom will experience
adverse outcomes and even death during the course of their treatment.
 This locus of the product's use, coupled with the stringent nature
of liability standards, has led to a substantial liability burden
that many observers view as unproductive.  For example, the National
Academy of Sciences concluded that high product liability costs
were largely responsible for shutting down American research with
respect to contraceptives<sup><a href="foot.html">1</a></sup>.  These costs eliminated research not
because the research was in any sense socially undesirable, but
because firms incurred costs whenever the research led to products
linked to the hazards associated with childbirth.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The substantial tort liability burden is particularly
striking in that it has been coupled with a situation in which
the pharmaceutical industry itself is highly regulated.  The particular
products sold are subject to highly stringent regulations with
respect to their safety and efficacy.  This pre-market approval
process is much more extensive than, for example, regulations
for automobiles or other consumer products that generate considerable
risks.  Indeed, many observers have suggested that pharmaceuticals
are overregulated because of the excessive weight placed on the
potential adverse effects of these products.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The high degree of regulation of pharmaceuticals
is inconsistent with a high tort liability exposure if the objective
of tort liability is to address inadequacies in the provision
of product safety.  The purpose of this paper is to indicate how
the tort liability system should be restructured to better reflect
the obligations that pharmaceutical and medical device manufacturers
have already met to through their compliance with government regulations.
 <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >This paper will explore how the tort liability
system functions and the rationale for the current structure.
 There is currently only minimal recognition of a regulatory compliance
defense for prescription drugs.  In the case of medical devices,
there is a legislative pre-emption that eliminates the threat
of tort liability.  Most Federal liability reform proposals have
only suggested limited regulatory compliance defenses for prescription
drugs, particularly with respect to punitive damages.  This paper
will suggest that these defenses should in fact be much broader
and should pertain to overall liability for drugs and devices
given regulatory approval, and not simply punitive damages.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Although the current FDA regulatory program
provides the institutional reference point, the proposals suggested
here are quite general.  The principal requirements that should
accompany any regulatory compliance defense are that any revision
of the FDA drug and medical device approval process maintain the
current safety standards and continue to establish a uniform warnings
vocabulary.  Provided that these two conditions are met, the rationales
for these proposals will be quite robust with respect to different
institutional structures. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT >The Importance of Pharmaceutical and Medical
Device Litigation</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT > </FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Product liability litigation against the pharmaceutical
and medical device industries has been considerable.  Notwithstanding
the rigorous regulatory review given to these products, plaintiffs
are often successful in obtaining recoveries for product-related
injuries.  Some of the biggest lines of litigation have involved
these products.  As of 1990, for example, there were 210,000 Dalkon
Shield personal injury claimants, 200,000 claimants against DES,
200,000 claimants against Bendectin, and 500 claimants involving
tampons<sup><a href="foot.html">2</a></sup>.  More recently, the breast implant litigation has led
to the establishment of a trust fund of over $4 billion to cover
potential losses.  This section will provide a brief overview
of some of the liability trends for the pharmaceutical industry<sup><a href="foot.html">3</a></sup>
and an assessment of the extent to which these litigation levels
exceed that for other industries.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >To explore these issues, this section will
focus on data for federal product liability cases developed by
the Administrative Office of the United States Courts.  This data
base makes it possible to track liability suits and awards for
cases in the Federal Courts.  Omitted from this tally will be
out of court settlements as well as cases resolved in state courts.
 This omission consequently will lead to a substantial understatement
of the overall level of product liability costs for the pharmaceutical
and medical device industry.  Moreover, to the extent that companies
are increasingly relying on out-of-court settlements to resolve
liability cost issues, as is evidenced in the establishment of
the breast implant compensation fund, there will be diminished
litigation.  This change in litigation strategies will create
a deceptive impression of the overall liability burden.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Figure 1 provides a profile of the number of
federal product liability cases for manufacturing industries<sup><a href="foot.html">4</a></sup> excluding
pharmaceuticals and for the pharmaceutical industry.  What is
striking about the case trends in Figure 1 is that the pharmaceutical
industry liability is often half or more that of the entire remaining
manufacturing sector of the economy.  In 1985 the number of pharmaceutical
industry cases in the Federal Courts was about double that of
all other manufacturing industries.  This tremendous liability
burden is dispro-portionate to the output share of pharmaceuticals.
 The remaining manufacturing sector excluding the pharmaceutical
industry had a dollar value of shipments that was much larger
than that of the pharmaceutical industry in 1989.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >To fully assess the extent of the liability
burden, one needs to know not only the number of cases filed but
also whether these cases are successful and what award was paid.
 The measure that will be used to assess the extent of pharmaceutical
industry liability will be the relative liability burden given
the scale of the industry.  In particular, Figure 2 provides a
profile of the ratio of the annual product liability awards to
the total sales both for pharmaceuticals as well as the remaining
manufacturing industry.  What is striking is that except in two
years in which the liability awards were unusually low, 1979 and
1989, the level of the relative liability burden was considerably
greater for the pharmaceutical industry than for the rest of the
manufacturing sector.  In the years of the greatest crisis in
tort liability from 1982 to 1986 the level of the liability burden
dwarfed that for the manufacturing sector.  Although the level
of liability awards in the Federal Courts declined after 1986,
even in 1987 and 1988 the relative liability burden for manufacturing
was considerably less than that for pharmaceuticals.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >When viewed in absolute terms, the extent of
the liability burden may not appear to be great.  For example,
even in the highest year of relative liability costs, 1986, the
federal product liability award percentage of sales was only 0.05
percent for pharmaceuticals.  However, the award percentage relative
to the profits of the firm is much greater.  Even more important
is that the federal product liability awards only should be used
as an index of the relative liability burden not as an indication
of the total extent of the liability costs.  Even for the Federal
suits, the out-of-pocket legal expenses and defense costs will
not be included in this tally.  An additional omission is that
cases settled out of court and all cases resolved in state courts
likewise will not be reflected in these data.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The basic message of Figures 1 and 2 is that
pharmaceutical liability has typically far outdistanced that of
other manufacturing industries, relative to its share of industrial
activity.  One hypothesis is that these products are more likely
to be defective and to cause injury than are other manufacturing
products.  However, it is noteworthy that the premarket review
and ongoing monitoring of the performance of pharmaceutical and
medical devices is much more vigorous than for any other major
product group.  The subsequent sections will explore this inconsistency
and examine the nature of the criteria applied by regulatory agencies.
 What will be particularly striking is that the same types of
criteria applied by the courts are mirrored in the regulatory
guidelines.  In effect, juries are second guessing decisions made
by the FDA on a prospective basis and are awarding substantial
verdicts to plaintiffs ex post even in instances in which the
Federal regulatory requirements were fulfilled.<BR>

<h3>The Current Regulatory Structure
and Its Implications for Tort Liability</h3>
<P>
The current role of the government with respect
to pharmaceuticals and medical devices is twofold.  First, the
government reviews these products to ensure their safety and efficacy.
 Second, the government plays an informational role in establishing
the kinds of information that can be conveyed with respect to
the characteristics of these products and the associated risks.
 The discussion below will consider the role of regulatory compliance
defense with respect to each of these aspects of government regulation.
<BR>
<P>
<b>Pre-Market Approval of Pharmaceuticals<BR>
</b>

<P>
The first phase of government regulation of
the products is a determination of which pharmaceutical products
are permitted to be marketed.  The first stage of this process
typically involves the submission of an investigational new drug
application to conduct trials for a new drug.  The legal requirements
for this application require that the company provide information
with respect to the chemistry, pharmacology, toxicology, and results
of animal and laboratory testing.<sup><a href="foot.html">5</a></sup>  These trials may then begin
provided the FDA does not either request more information or modify
the protocol submitted by the company for the proposed clinical
trials.  From a practical standpoint, the nature of the protocols
are often dictated by the FDA.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
The clinical trial process consists of three
phases.  Phase one trials are designed to elicit information about
&quot;the metabolism and pharmacologic actions of the drugs in
humans, [and] the side effects associated with increasing doses.&quot;<sup><a href="foot.html">6</a></sup>
These tests are also intended to provide information pertaining
to the product's safety.  These phase one trials typically involve
tests on a small number of healthy adults- approximately 20-80
people.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
If the phase one trials are successful, the
company proceeds to undertake phase two trials, which typically
involve testing the drug on 200-300 people who have the specific
disease or condition for which the product is targeted.  The phase
two trials are &quot;conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of
the drug for a particular indication or indications in patients
with the disease or condition under study.&quot;<sup><a href="foot.html">7</a></sup>  In addition,
these trials are intended to assess whether there are adverse
side effects associated with the drug.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
If the phase two trials are also successful,
the company proceeds to the phase three clinical trials involving
1,000 - 3,000 patients who also have the specific condition or
disease for which the drug is targeted.<sup><a href="foot.html">8</a></sup>  As the phase three trials
reach conclusion, the company submits a new drug application (NDA)
to the FDA to obtain permission to sell the pharmaceutical product.
 This application must include both safety and efficacy information,
and it is a compendium of all the available data obtained thus
far regarding the performance of the drugs with respect to these
two objectives.  In addition, the NDA must include information
pertaining to the proposed labeling for the new drug.<sup><a href="foot.html">9</a></sup><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
In evaluating the NDA, the FDA must ensure
that the product complies with the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic
Act (FDCA) requirements pertaining to safety, and that &quot;substantial
evidence&quot; of efficacy be demonstrated.  This stage of the
drug approval process is often quite lengthy, as the FDA review
often takes years after the submission of the NDA.  In many cases
these delays arise because the FDA requests new information from
the pharmaceutical company.  Overall, the NDA process takes between
five to seven years and involves a cost that has been estimated
to be as high as $231 million for each NDA.<sup><a href="foot.html">10</a></sup><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
An additional cost of the drug lag is that
patients in the United States will be deprived of drugs that potentially
could reduce mortality and morbidity.  There are thus two types
of competing errors known as Type I and Type II errors that could
arise with respect to the approval of new drugs.  The FDA might
approve drugs that turn out to have adverse consequences such
as thalidomide, which was approved in Great Britain but never
approved for use in the United States.  On the other hand, the
FDA could fail to approve drugs that are beneficial and would
have reduced risks because of excessively stringent safety standards.
 Many academic critics of the FDA have charged that the FDA has
erred too greatly on the side of preventing errors of commission
rather than being concerned with the risks that would be averted
by the new drugs that it fails to approve.<sup><a href="foot.html">11</a></sup>  The AIDS lobbyists
have called particular attention to the effect of these substantial
delays as well as the imbalance in attention that the FDA places
on errors of commission as opposed to errors of omission.  This
special disease interest lobbying group has succeeded in expediting
the review process for AIDS-related drugs.  Other potential beneficiaries
of drugs that are delayed by the lengthy review process are not
as well organized and are not as effective in bringing political
pressure to bear to make the FDA more responsive to the patients
who could benefit from these new products.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
The primary implication of this stringent drug
approval process for the regulatory compliance defense is that
the current concern with the potential safety of new drugs is
already quite substantial.  Indeed, from an economic efficiency
standpoint, one might well argue that the FDA places excessive
reliance on safety, particularly on the safety aspects pertaining
to adverse effects that might be created by drugs.  All that is
needed for purposes of the subsequent discussion of the regulatory
compliance defense is the general result that the FDA procedures
or privately operated procedures will ensure adequate levels of
safety.  These tests will fulfill a company's obligation to provide
an efficient level of safety associated with its products. <BR>
<P>
<b>Regulation of Drug Labeling<BR>
</b>

<P>
Prescription drugs by their very nature pose
potential risks either from misuse or adverse reactions, which
leads to the prescription requirement.  Medical devices also pose
potential risks of a similar nature.  As a result, the FDA requires
that information pertaining to the associated risks be provided
with these products.  In the case of pharmaceutical products,
the warning label must communicate both the overall risk associated
with the product as well as any specific risks associated with
particular groups of product users.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
Under the regulatory system established by
the FDCA, the FDA is largely responsible for writing the complete
content of the package inserts<sup><a href="foot.html">12</a></sup> that accompany pharmaceutical products.
 One former FDA General Counsel observed that the &quot;FDA ...
retains, as a practical matter, complete control over package
inserts.&quot;  Unlike the warnings practices under the OSHA hazard
communications standard or EPA labeling requirements for pesticides,
the FDA has both substantial control of the content of the warnings
as well as the warning structure.  In particular, the FDA has
in place a standardized warnings vocabulary that is used to communicate
the risks associated with the drugs.  This vocabulary stipulates
which kinds of information are presented in different places on
the label as well as how different variations in the label, such
as boxing of warnings or larger print, should be used to highlight
specific warnings.  Because of the standardized warnings approach
and the fact that physicians receive training in the processing
of such warning information in pharmacology courses, this system
provides an efficient means of communicating risk information
to the learned intermediary involved in prescribing pharmaceutical
products.  The fact that it is not the patient, but rather the
physician (learned intermediary) who is the target audience for
the warnings greatly affects the character and content of the
warnings message.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
The FDA does not develop the warnings language
in isolation.  Rather, the manufacturer is required to submit
to the FDA information pertaining to both the safety and the efficacy
of the product as part of its NDA.  In addition, the manufacturer
must submit proposed labeling for the drug for the FDA review.<sup><a href="foot.html">13</a></sup>
 In conjunction with the manufacturer, the FDA develops the initial
label for the drug.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
There is often a bargaining process between
the FDA and the manufacturer over the content of the warning label.
 The FDA has the ultimate authority since approval of the labeling
is a necessary part of the NDA approval process.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
The structure of the warnings vocabulary developed
by the FDA consists of the following sections.  The first section
of the warning label provides information that describes the general
characteristics of the product.<sup><a href="foot.html">14</a></sup>  The second section of the warning
label consists of information pertaining to the clinical pharmacology
of the product, whereby the warning provides information pertaining
to how the particular product operates.  The third section of
the label provides information pertaining to the indications and
the usage of the drug, and this is followed by a contraindications
section indicating the situations under which the drug should
not be administered because of the particular risks that may be
involved.  This section is followed by a warnings section that
details the risks that arise both generally as well as in specific
situations with respect to the drug.  Less frequently occurring
risks are the subject of the precautions section.  Isolated and
more random reactions to the drug are the subject of the adverse
reactions section.  Following this series of risk information
sections, the warning concludes with information about the appropriate
dosage and administration of the product.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
The standardized structure of this warnings
vocabulary greatly facilitates the ability of the physician to
process the warnings information.  The FDA also ensures a uniformity
in the use of the warnings language and a correspondence between
the language and the severity of the particular outcomes being
characterized.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
This kind of standardization could be generalized
to contexts in which the FDA did not have the authority to control
and review warnings but instead established as a reference point
a warnings vocabulary framework.  Thus, companies could provide
information with respect to a drug following these guidelines
for the positioning of information and guidelines with respect
to the usage of labeling variations such as boxing of particular
warning sections.  Liability for the company could then be based
on whether the company adhered to the particular warnings vocabulary
guidelines given the characteristics of the product.  Thus, in
our subsequent discussion of the regulatory compliance defense,
no distinction will be made between a warnings policy mandated
by the FDA or a warnings policy based on guidelines established
by the FDA.  It must, however, by recognized that there may be
an additional liability exposure if the FDA does not operate and
specifically approve the warning since then the company must show
that this warning did in fact adhere to the regulatory guidelines.
<BR>
<P>
<b>Post-Marketing Information<BR>
</b>

<P>
After a drug is made available for sale, there
may be adverse consequences that are observed that were not apparent
during the testing process.  If these problems are particularly
severe, it may be appropriate to withdraw the drug from the market.
 Thus, the safety of the drug should be a continuing concern.
 Similarly, if there are adverse consequences associated with
the drug that were not included in the initial labeling, the hazard
information provided should be amended over time to reflect this
changing informational state.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
In each case the appropriate reference point
for whether a firm has met its obligation should be the state
of the information at that particular time.  Moreover, because
adverse reactions and effects of drugs are often the subject of
speculation involving small samples, there must be some test of
the scientific validity of the adverse information before companies
should be held responsible for incorporating it in the drug evaluation
process.  A patient administered a drug for a particular ailment
may experience some adverse health effect.  However, in the absence
of a controlled experiment, it is not possible to ascertain whether
this effect is a consequence of the drug or a random variation
in health status that would have occurred if the drug had not
been administered.  The medical literature is replete with possible
adverse effects of this kind.  Some of these are subsequently
bolstered by scientific data, and others prove to be aberrations
that are never established in the literature.  In retrospect,
it is often possible to point to instances in which there was
initial fragmentary evidence regarding an adverse effect that
is ultimately established, but what is important is whether the
information available at any particular point in time is sufficient
to provide a reason for concern.  Effects that appear clearcut
in hindsight may not be evident given the state of information
at an earlier time.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
In that regard, the FDCA requires that the
pharmaceutical companies share with the FDA information pertaining
to the post-marketing performance of the drug.  This surveillance
process requires that the company report adverse experiences associated
with the drug as well as epidemiologic studies.  The current requirements
are that a company must report any serious reactions to a drug
to the FDA within 15 working days of the receipt of the information.<sup><a href="foot.html">15</a></sup>
 The sources of information that the manufacturer must examine
for these post-marketing studies include clinical, epidemiological,
or surveillance studies, as well as information that appears in
the medical literature.  The FDA then uses that information to
assess whether the drug should continue to be marketed or whether
there should be some change in the labeling for it.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
These provisions ensure the safety of drugs
and the appropriateness of information provision.  Regulation
is consequently an ongoing process that continues to reflect the
evolving state of information with respect to the drug.  Under
the current procedures, the FDA must approve any post-marketing
changes associated with the labeling of the drug, although a company
is free to withdraw a drug from the market should it choose to
do so.<sup><a href="foot.html">16</a></sup>  However, if the company does take such unilateral action,
it must simultaneously seek FDA approval for it, and if the FDA
does not approve the change it can institute a regulatory action
against the company.  Moreover, the FDA can overrule the company's
decision to change the warning label if it believes that such
a change would be inappropriate.  <BR>

<br>
<h3>The Role of Tort Law</h3>
<P>
<FONT >By imposing costs on the tortfeasor, the liability
system generates both incentives for efficient risk avoidance
as well as compensation for accident victims.  In the case of
monetary losses, both strict liability and negligence standards
will lead to an efficient level of precautions and will lead to
an optimal level of compensation for the accident victim.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Matters become somewhat different in the case
of health effects.  It is very difficult to compensate an individual
for an extreme loss of health status, such as one's life, since
finite amounts of compensation may not make one whole.  The amount
of compensation that would be needed to generate efficient incentives
would be quite large.  An efficient level of damages from a deterrence
standpoint would provide adequate financial incentive to lead
the manufacture to sell products that had an optimal level of
safety when valued using the preferences for safety of the consumer.
 How, for example, do the values of greater safety compare with
the higher cost levels of safer products?  For example, evidence
on the implicit value of life that is appropriate from the standpoint
of deterring risks is $5 million per life.  However, this amount
is not an appropriate guide for insurance and compensation.  Few
individuals would choose to purchase an insurance policy that
would make a payoff of this size in the event of their death.
 As a result, compensation amounts of this magnitude would provide
efficient incentives for deterrence but would provide excessive
insurance.  Consequently, one could view the current tort system
as somewhat split in that the amount of compensation is more closely
linked to the optimal insurance amount, such as the present value
of lost earnings, medical costs, and some compensation for pain
and suffering.  In contrast, the criteria for liability are linked
to generating efficient standards for safety.  Thus, the firm's
obligation is to provide an adequate level of safety for the good,
where this level of adequacy is what would prevail if a good were
traded in a fully functioning and efficient market.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The responsibilities of tort liability to provide
incentives for safety and compensation to accident victims depend
of course on the other societal institutions in place.  If, for
example, an individual at risk were compensated through the workers'
compensation system, there would be less need for compensation
through the tort liability system.  Similarly, if the risk level
and the adequacy of warnings is handled through a regulatory structure
that ensures an efficient level of precautions, then there is
no rationale from the standpoint of adequate deterrence for having
tort liability.  Thus, to the extent that the FDA regulations
achieve the social objective of efficient levels of control of
risk, then there is no need to duplicate this function through
additional tort liability.  The obvious exception is that in which
the company withholds critical information from the regulatory
agency so that the regulation cannot be set in an ideal manner.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Government regulations can of course be set
either too leniently or too stringently.  The fact that there
is a government regulation does not necessarily imply that there
is no role for any supplementary social institution, such as tort
liability.  However, in the case of the FDA, the general consensus
is that these regulations are certainly adequate in ensuring safety
and, to the extent that there is any divergence from optimality,
it is that the regulations are excessively stringent with respect
to the promotion of product safety.  If there is already over-deterrence,
there is consequently no rationale for bolstering of the level
of deterrence additionally through incentives provided through
tort liability.  This consideration pertains to the deterrence
or incentive role of tort liability, not necessarily to the compensation
function since regulations do not provide for the compensation
of accident victims.  However, at least from the standpoint of
safety incentives, the optimal use of regulations is to target
them in areas where there are clearly inadequate safety incentives
provided.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >There is a widespread consensus in the literature
that the current FDA drug approval process establishes safety
incentives that are excessive.<sup><a href="foot.html">17</a></sup>  The stringency of the process
and the meticulous review of new pharmaceutical drugs is reflected
in the substantial delays that U.S. consumers have experienced
with respect to the introduction of new pharmaceutical products.
 These delays are much greater than in other countries, such as
those in Europe, which also have regulatory procedures to ensure
drug safety.  Studies have also shown that because of these delays
Americans have been prevented from having access to new drugs
with beneficial effects, as the agency places a greater weight
on errors of commission rather than errors of omission.  This
imbalance in the emphasis for these two types of errors has led
to excessive deterrence of new risks that may be created by pharmaceutical
products and inadequate weight on reducing existing risks that
patients now experience.  Because these incentives already ensure
a degree of caution and safety with respect to introducing new
pharmaceutical products that is already excessive, one would not
want to further deter companies from introducing beneficial new
products through additional tort liability sanctions.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >One possible counterargument is that after
the drug is approved it may turn out to have adverse effects that
were not anticipated.  However, the task regarding the safety
and efficacy of the product is to make the best judgement that
is possible at the time the product is marketed.  If new information
becomes available to indicate that the product is riskier than
was initially believed, then the company should be held responsible
for acting upon this new information in a reasonable manner and
developing new labeling if necessary.  This way of dealing with
new information is the approach taken in Europe with respect to
medical devices in which companies have a &quot;development-risk&quot;
defense.  Companies are free of liability in the tort liability
regime in all EU countries other than Luxembourg if they can show
that the &quot;state of scientific and technical knowledge at
the time when he put the product into circulation was not such
as to enable the existence of the defect to be discovered.&quot;
 This state of the information defense coupled with a requirement
that companies meet the regulatory standards would ensure than
an efficient degree of product safety be provided both at the
time of the product's introduction as well as throughout the product's
life.  Once this has been assured, there is no additional rationale
for augmenting these safety incentives, at least from the standpoint
of risk prevention.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Off-label uses and their relation to a regulatory
compliance defense is an important issue.  The restrictions that
are pertinent for advertising drugs for off-label usage are now
quite stringent<sup><a href="foot.html">18</a></sup>.  For example, in the case of investigational
new drugs that are currently undergoing clinical study, it is
not possible to promote the drug for the usage that is currently
under scrutiny.  Notwithstanding these restrictions on the promotion
of pharmaceutical products, it is generally believed that off-label
usage are quite prevalent, particularly in the cases of AIDS and
cancer treatments.  Much of pediatric age group drug use is also
off-label.  One survey suggested that nearly one-third of the
prescriptions of oncologists for cancer patients were for off-label
usage.  In addition, an estimated 56 percent of cancer patients
have received at least one drug under an off-label purpose.  
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The degree to which there is insurance reimbursement
for off-label usages depends in large part on the nature of the
experimental treatment and the existence of medical evidence supporting
its reliability.  Many off-label treatments for cancer, for example,
are not reimbursed.  Approximately one-half of 681 oncologists
surveyed by the U.S. General Accounting Office reported that at
some point they had been denied reimbursement for the costs of
an off-label prescription<sup><a href="foot.html">19</a></sup>.  That same U.S. General Accounting
Office survey also found that one-third of all the prescriptions
involving cancer chemotherapy involved off-label uses.  Among
the most controversial reimbursements for off-label usage has
been the insurance coverage for the high dose chemotherapy-autologous
bone marrow transplants, which is an expensive and risky treatment.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Strict adherents to regulatory criteria might
speculate that all off-label uses are inappropriate and should
not be undertaken since they have not been accorded FDA approval.
 However, in many instances the opposite conclusion has been reached.<sup><a href="foot.html">20</a></sup>
 The courts have ruled, for example, that Medicaid coverage could
not exclude AZT therapy for an off-label purpose for some classes
of AIDS patients.  Similarly, the courts have ruled that Blue
Cross-Blue Shield must reimburse high dose chemotherapy-autologous
bone marrow transplants.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >As Christopher (1993) notes, the nature of
the New York legal provisions with respect to off-label usage
is quite complex: &quot;New York forbids insurers from excluding
coverage of off-label uses of cancer drugs if: (1) prescription
drugs are otherwise covered in the policy; (2) the drug is FDA-approved
for some form of cancer; and (3) the off-label use in question
is recognized by one of the three compendia or recommended by
review article or editorial comment in a major peer-reviewed journal.&quot;
 However, he goes on to note that: &quot;The New York law, however,
allows insurers to exclude from coverage off-label uses expressly
contraindicated by FDA-approved labelling and experimental or</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >investigational drugs.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The nature of the regulatory compliance defense
is somewhat complicated by the use of drugs for off-label purposes.
 The regulatory criteria and the assurance that the drug has met
efficient standards for safety only pertains to uses for which
the drug has been specifically approved, or those uses specified
on the label.  In the case of off-label uses, there has not been
the same kind of review and approval that would provide an ex
ante guarantee that the firm has met its obligations with respect
to safety and efficacy for these uses.  As a result, in the case
of the off-label uses the regulatory compliance defense that is
advocated here would not be pertinent.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The practical consequences of this distinction
for off-label uses may be substantial.  It has been estimated
that about half of all drugs prescribed by doctors are given for
off-label uses because the drug is believed to be effective for
these off-label purposes.  At a fairly pedestrian level, one has
doctors prescribing Retin-A for middle aged patients who wish
to eliminate wrinkles even though this is not an on-label purpose
of this anti-acne drug.  Perhaps more importantly in terms of
individual welfare is that many cancer treatments involve off-label
uses of drugs.  At present there are no requirements that physicians
disclose to patients that the particular therapy being prescribed
is an off-label usage.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Whereas there is currently no regulatory compliance
defense in the case of pharmaceuticals, in the case of medical
devices, the 1976 Medical Devices Amendments pre-empted liability
claims against medical devices.  Pre-emption is stronger than
a regulatory compliance defense in that it forecloses all product
liability suits.  The 1995 case of <U>Michael v. Shiley, Inc.</U>
found that these Amendments pre-empted all liability actions involving
negligence, strict liability, and breech of warranty for medical
devices.<sup><a href="foot.html">21</a></sup>  This pre-emption includes all medical devices, not simply
the class III medical devices that are subject to the formal FDA
pre-market approval process.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The main exception to such broad interpretations
of the regulatory compliance defense was the recent decision by
the Ninth Circuit in <U>Kennedy v. Collagen Corp</U><sup><a href="foot.html">22</a></sup>.  In this
case, the court upheld pre-emption only when the FDA had enacted
&quot;specific counterpart requirements&quot; applicable to the
device.  Since the court viewed the pre-market approval process
for Class III devices as not constituting a Federal &quot;requirement,&quot;
the scope of the pre-emption would be severely restricted<sup><a href="foot.html">23</a></sup>.  To
date, this decision remains the exception, as other courts have
interpreted the exemption provisions quite broadly.<BR>
</FONT>
<P><b>Punitive Damages<BR>
</b>

<P>
<FONT >The role of the regulatory compliance defense
has been most prominent with respect to punitive damages rather
than with respect to the overall liability of pharmaceutical and
medical device firms.  Although it will be suggested below that
regulatory compliance should be a defense with respect to all
tort liability, it is even more compelling that punitive damages
are not warranted if a firm has fulfilled all of its regulatory
obligations and has not withheld information from the regulatory
agency.  Groups such as the American Law Institute (1991) have
indicated that abolition of punitive damages in such instances
of regulatory compliance is a particularly desirable reform.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >To see why punitive damages reforms head the
list of necessary changes in tort law, let us examine the circumstances
under which punitive damages above and beyond compensatory damages
are awarded and why these damages are not pertinent when pharmaceutical
and medical device companies have complied with government regulations.
 One rationale for punitive damages may be that compensatory damages
alone do not provide adequate deterrence when life and health
are at risk.  This argument is certainly correct from an economic
standpoint, but the role of optimal deterrence will have already
been addressed through regulatory compliance.  If a firm has already
met regulatory standards that ensure a level of safety that is
either efficient or is a more stringent safety level than dictated
by economic efficiency concerns, then there is no additional economic
rationale for punitive damages to augment the safety requirements.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >A second rationale for punitive damages is
that they would be warranted if the company's safety efforts fell
well below what was required to provide an efficient level of
safety with respect to the product.  If a firm has not met the
requirements stipulated by the regulation, then certainly punitive
damages may be warranted.  However, if all the regulatory stipulations
with respect to testing and information provision have been met,
then it is not possible that a company's safety efforts could
have fallen greatly below what should be expected since these
expectations are already set out through the regulatory guidelines.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >This kind of regulatory compliance defense
may not be warranted with respect to every form of government
regulation.  However, the FDA regulations for pharmaceuticals
differ both in their nature and their stringency.  The distinctive
character of pharmaceutical regulations is that they are extremely
meticulous regulations that entail the premarket review of the
product, extensive testing of the product, a determination of
the safety and efficacy of the product, a provision of risk information
through a procedure that conforms with a highly structured warnings
vocabulary, and post-market surveillance.  These stipulations
certainly go well beyond what might be envisioned by a jury in
any particular case. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Another possible objective of punitive damages
is compensation.  However, this objective should already have
been adequately handled by the compensatory aspect of damages.
 The standard components of tort liability are designed to address
the efficient levels of compensation needed by accident victims.
 If, for example, the courts were to routinely award punitive
damages, this practice would not even be in the interest of consumers
of these products.  Higher liability costs will raise the cost
of producing the product, which in turn will raise the product
price.  In effect, purchasers of a product will be paying for
the higher punitive damage awards through more expensive products.<sup><a href="foot.html">24</a></sup>
 Payments of this type are desirable in the case of compensatory
damages that replicate the kinds of insurance that individuals
would have purchased freely.  However, if individuals would not
have purchased insurance to provide for the kinds of compensation
associated with punitive damages, then in effect, a liability
regime that imposes excessive punitive damages will have forced
customers to buy more insurance for their accident losses than
they would have chosen to provide for themselves if they could
have designed such an insurance mechanism.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >A final objective of punitive damages might
be that of retribution.  Although additional penalties on a firm
do serve as a form of retributive punishment, one must also inquire
whose interest such punishment promotes.  If adequate deterrence
and safety incentives are already ensured, retributive punishment
is not needed.  From the standpoint of the consumers of the product,
retributive punishment will not be in their interests if the higher
product price that they must pay for the litigated products reflects
the added costs imposed by such retribution.  Although there may
be instances in which customers will be willing to pay higher
prices for products to know that damages will be assessed to punish
companies, one would expect that such willingness would be associated
with flagrant disregards of safety.  If the company in fact met
regulatory guidelines for efficient provision of safe products,
then there should be little support for retributive punishment
such as this.  If there were such support, then that presumably
would be an indication of a societal preference for even more
stringent pharmaceutical and medical device safety standards than
are now in place.  Thus, a shift in the regulatory guidelines
to promote greater safety levels in response to the preferences
of consumers could ensure that these retributive preferences were
represented without having to rely on punitive damages.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Once the efficient level of safety has been
provided, punitive damages are not innocuous.  Imposing punitive
damages will deter companies from innovating products that might
potentially be subject to punitive damages, such as contraceptives.
 Similarly, companies will have an incentive to exit the market
altogether in an effort to avoid punitive damages, as has been
the case with respect to the production of vaccines.  Deterring
innovations and promoting market exit is not desirable if these
actions are the result of sanctions that are not linked to a provision
of an efficient degree of safety but in fact are imposed on the
firm even if appropriate safety standards have been met.<BR>
</FONT>
<P><b>The Current Common Law Approach<BR>
</b>

<P>
<FONT >Although there have been many discussions of
the regulatory compliance defense for FDA-approved products with
respect to punitive damages, the position taken here will be that
there also should be a regulatory compliance with respect to liability
more generally.  To examine the rationale for this defense, we
must first examine the current status of tort liability as well
as its linkage to the pharmaceutical industry.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Most observers attribute the tort liability
revolution to the emergence of strict liability as well as subsequent
developments in tort law.  The American Law Institute's Restatement
(Second) of Torts was a pivotal document that codified the strict
liability doctrine and indicated that this doctrine would replace
negligence as the preferred theory of liability.<sup><a href="foot.html">25</a></sup>  Section 402a
imposes liability on a firm if the product is &quot;in a defective
condition, unreasonably dangerous&quot; even though &quot;all
possible care&quot; was exercised &quot;in the preparation and
sale of the product.&quot;  This standard consequently is more
stringent than the negligence standard which only required that
an efficient level of safety be provided for the firm to be free
of liability.  For example, additional company expenditures on
safety are desirable so long as the marginal safety benefits exceed
the marginal safety costs.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >It is noteworthy that the original drafters
of Restatement (Second) of Torts apparently did not envision that
these criteria were to be applied to &quot;unavoidably unsafe
products,&quot; such as drugs and vaccines:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<I><FONT >Unavoidably unsafe products.</FONT></I><FONT >
 There are some products which, in the present state of human
knowledge, are quite incapable of being made safe for their intended
and ordinary use.  These are especially common in the field of
drugs.  An outstanding example is the vaccine for the Pasteur
treatment of rabies, which not uncommonly leads to very serious
and damaging consequences when it is injected.  Since the disease
itself invariable leads to a dreadful death, both the marketing
and the use of the vaccine are fully justified, notwithstanding
the unavoidably high degree of risk which they involve.  Such
a product, properly prepared, and accompanied by proper directions
and warnings, is not defective, nor is it unreasonably dangerous.
 The same is true of many other drugs, vaccines, and the like,
many of which for this reason cannot legally be sold except to
physicians or under the prescription of a physician.  It is also
true in many new or experimental drugs as to which, because of
the lack of time and opportunity for sufficient medical experience,
there can be no assurance of safety ... but such experience as
there is justifies the marketing and use of the drug notwithstanding
a medically recognizable risk.  The seller of such products, again
with the qualification that they are properly prepared and marketed,
and proper warning is given, where the situation calls for it,
is not to be held to strict liability for unfortunate consequences
attending their use, merely because he has undertaken to supply
the public with an apparently useful and desirable product, attended
with a known but apparently reasonable risk.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Thus, pharmaceutical products were to be exempted
from these criteria. Not-withstanding this distinction, the judicial
interpretations eventually broadened the &quot;unreasonably dangerous&quot;
test and began to focus on what constituted &quot;defectiveness.&quot;
 In <U>Barker v. Lull Engineering Company</U><sup><a href="foot.html">26</a></sup>, the court ruled
[a] product is defective in design either (1) if the product has
failed to preform as safely as an ordinary consumer would expect
when used in an intended or reasonably foreseeable manner or (2)
if, in the light of development factors discussed below, the benefits
of the challenged design do not outweigh the risk of danger inherent
in such design.  In subsequent years, both risk-utility tests
and consumer expectation tests proliferated, and it is the general
consensus that the risk-utility test is more appropriate. <sup><a href="foot.html">27</a></sup> The
manufacturer should not be liable for what the consumer might
expect since these expectations need in no way be reasonable,
but a risk-utility test that has a parallel with an economic benefit-cost
test certainly is pertinent.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The most prevalently used risk-utility test
is that developed by Dean Wade.<sup><a href="foot.html">28</a></sup>  That test consists of a variety
of factors that would affect the desirability of the product,
where all but one of these factors is subsumed into a conventional
benefit-cost test.  The one distinctive factor is that the producer
serves in an insurance role for accident victims through the tort
liability awards for product injuries.  It is this insurance role
that underlies the development of strict liability more generally.
 The general notion is that firms provide insurance for consumers
of products through tort liability, where these insurance costs
are transmitted to consumers through higher product prices.  This
theory is sound in the case of rare event product accidents such
as that associated with isolated manufacturing defects, but this
analogy breaks down in the case of mass toxic torts.  The costs
imposed by large scale litigation such as the Dalkon Shield case
cannot be shifted to consumers.  Moreover, it is not feasible
for the company to bear such large scale costs.  The result has
been that many firms have exited the market with respect to development
of new contraceptives and production of vaccines because of the
large scale of these costs.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Pharmaceutical companies have not escaped the
impact of strict liability.  Several jurisdictions have found
that as a matter of law pharmaceutical products are not unavoidably
unsafe.<sup><a href="foot.html">29</a></sup>  More importantly, the courts have not ruled that compliance
with the FDCA provides a defense in the case of product liability
actions.  Pharmaceutical companies have also been found liable
with respect to the development of new liability doctrines with
respect to hazard warnings even though these warnings are specifically
approved by the FDA and developed in accordance with a highly
structured warnings vocabulary specified by the FDA.  At the present
time, the majority of all courts do not recognize the FDA regulatory
compliance defense with respect to overall liability of the firm.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The effects in the absence of regulatory compliance
defense have been quite striking.  Producers of the DPT vaccine,
for example, were exposed to substantial liability that led to
considerable caution throughout the vaccine market.  Since 1968,
the number of vaccine manufacturers in the United States has dropped
by more than 50 percent.  The American vaccine market is now controlled
by single producer monopolies in the case of vaccines for polio,
rubella, measles, mumps, and rabies.  There are similar kinds
of monopolies for many pediatric vaccines as well.  The substantial
costs of tort liability consequently have led to the exit of the
market of substantial markets concentration for vaccines.  The
result has been a considerable rise in the price of vaccines,
well in excess of the inflation rate.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >There have been, of course, changes in the
vaccine areas that have been prompted by the effects of the liability
burden.  In particular, Congress passed the Childhood Vaccine
Injury Act of 1986 in order to replace the burdensome tort litigation
process with an administrative compensation system.  Even in the
case of vaccines, this legislation has not completely eliminated
the tort liability problems.  Many vaccines, such as the chicken
pox vaccine, are not covered by the provisions of the act.  In
addition, this administrative compensation system, which is financed
by a tax on the pharmaceutical companies, requires that claimants
file claims through this program, but the claimant is free to
reject this award and can pursue a tort action under state law
if the claimant views the award as unsatisfactory.  An additional
deterrent to competition in the vaccine industry is that once
firms exited the market for vaccines, it was difficult to reenter.
 Thus, this major liability reform in the vaccine area should
be viewed as an incomplete remedy for the liability problems that
existed.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >To the extent that there has been any exemption
it has been with respect to punitive damages.  Thus far, there
are five states - Arizona, New Jersey, Ohio, Oregon, and Utah
- that have provided for an FDA regulatory compliance defense
against punitive damages.  There has been no punitive damage defense
adopted through Federal legislation, although such a defense is
frequently included in draft bills.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Medical devices are regulated under the 1976
Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act.  Companies
are permitted to market class I medical devices, such as tongue
depressors without government approval.  Class II medical devices,
such as hearing aids, were formerly required to meet government
approved performance standards, and class III medical devices,
such as heart valves, still must undergo a process similar to
that for pharmaceuticals.  In particular, there is a pre-market
approval process for such devices.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The liability regime for pharmaceuticals is
in striking context to medical devices.  The Medical Devices Amendments
of 1976, which were amendments to FDCA, grant a pre-emption defense
for medical devices that is similar in spirit but stronger than
a regulatory compliance defense.  Indeed, in the recent 1995 case
of Michael D. Shiley, Inc., the court ruled that the medical devices
amendments of 1976 pre-empt actions involving negligence, strict
liability, and breach of implied warranty for medical devices.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In the case of medical devices, there is not
only pre-emption of cases under Federal law but also claims under
state law as well.  In particular, in 1995 the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the First Circuit ruled that the Medical Device Amendments
to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act pre-empted all state tort
claims.  Moreover, this pre-emption was held to be true even if
the manufacturer defrauded the Food and Drug Administration and
did not in fact achieve regulatory compliance.<sup><a href="foot.html">30</a></sup>  The defrauding
company was, however, subject to criminal fines for conspiracy
to defraud the FDA and was required to pay total fines of $61
million.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >What is striking about this regulatory compliance
defense, in contrast with the treatment of pharmaceuticals, is
that only class three medical devices (devices that are implanted
under the skin) are subject to premanufacturing review.  The more
minor class I and II devices are not subject to premanufacturing
review, although they are subject to postmarketing surveillance
by the FDA.  The irony of this distinction is that in contrast
with exhaustive pre-marketing review of pharmaceuticals, which
often takes up to a decade, the device approval process has been
estimated to take an average of one year.<sup><a href="foot.html">31</a></sup><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >This discrepancy has even led to an important
anomaly in terms of product treatment.  The Copper-7 intrauterine
device was in fact a medical device, not a pharmaceutical.  However,
before the passage of the medical device amendments of 1968, there
needed to be some means of classifying this product, and FDA chose
to classify it as a pharmaceutical.  If this product had in fact
been regulated under the subsequently promulgated Medical Device
Amendments of 1976, the firm would have been free of its ultimately
substantial liability.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The overall policy proposal of this report
is to make the regulatory compliance defense more symmetric for
both pharmaceutical products and medical devices.  Although a
regulatory compliance defense for pharmaceutical products will
not be as strong as the pre-emption given to medical devices,
it will create more similar legal framework.  The premanufacturing
review process for pharmaceuticals is much more stringent than
for medical devices.  The criteria involved ensure the safety
and efficacy of the product based on the best available state
of the information at the time.  There is no rationale for continuing
the distinction that puts pharmaceutical products at such a substantial
relative disadvantage.<BR>

<br>
<h3>Legal Implication of a Revised Approval Process</h3><BR>

<P>
<FONT >We have outlined sweeping proposals for the
revision of the pharmaceutical and medical device approvals.<sup><a href="foot.html">32</a></sup> 
The essential elements of this proposal would be to privatize
the review process for new drugs and pharmaceuticals and to foster
competition in this review process.  In the case of pharmaceuticals,
the Drug Certifying Bodies would approve the IND for the drug,
oversee the clinical development, review the NDA, and certify
that the product is safe and effective.  After this review process
was completed, the FDA would have responsibility for the final
sign off in a highly structured review process.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Delegating these responsibilities to private
entities does not necessarily create any legal problems.  Government
agencies, including the FDA, frequently draw on the expertise
and input of private parties in a variety of regulatory areas.
 What is essential, however, is that this delegation of responsibility
be handled in a sound manner to avoid any constitutional problem
that might arise in the delegation of legislative power.<sup><a href="foot.html">33</a></sup><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In the case of medical devices, the manufacturing
and/or Device Certifying Body would be responsible for compliance
with established standards-based criteria.  In the case of the
highest risk devices, the FDA would do a review and confirm that
proper standards had been used.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In each case, there would be no compromise
in the safety and efficacy levels of products as compared to the
current regime.  The ultimate sign-off for these products would
also be the responsibility of the Food and Drug Administration
as would the overall character of the safety criteria.  The same
kinds of regulatory compliance defenses that would be sound proposals
under the current product liability and regulatory regime would
also be pertinent if the plan's proposals were adopted.  Thus,
if companies were in compliance with the government regulation
as administered under this new process, then the level of safety
provided by the company would be efficient, thus meeting the safety
objectives of either a negligence or strict liability standard.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Under the revised plan review process, the
Device Certifying Bodies and Drug Certifying Bodies would have
a critical role in the review process.  What, however, would be
the ultimate liability of these certifying bodies?  In the absence
of specific legal exemptions, these bodies potentially could be
subject to the usual liability criteria notably negligence and
strict liability.  If, however, thh2>IV. Regulatory Reform and Lia
liability then there would be a substantial deterrent for any
firm to enter the market as a DCB.  Such companies would face
the prospect of being named as a defendant in any potential product
liability litigation involving a drug or medical device for which
they had been involved in the approval process.  Particularly
in a world of joint and several liability in which a DCB could
be potentially responsible for the entire liability burden if
the defendant company was unable to meet the cost involved in
the award, the DCBs would risk bankruptcy in much the same way
do many companies which face the prospect of mass toxic tort litigation
or punitive damages.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In this instance, a reasonable proposal for
structuring the liability system would be to draw distinction
between potential liability with respect to negligence and strict
liability.  One would want to maintain incentives for the DCB
to exercise care in the approval of new drugs.  Thus, we would
not want the DCB to be negligent in overseeing the review process
for drugs or medical devices.  Thus, permitting suits against
the DCB by an injured plaintiff on the basis of negligence would
provide for the possibility of court sanctions against irresponsible
DCB behavior.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >This liability exposure could be coupled with
the provision of a legal exemption from strict liability.  Although
the experience of Underwriters' Laboratory and other certifying
bodies suggests that strict liability has not been of consequence
to date, a specific legal exemption from strict liability could
be beneficial in eliminating the small risk of catastrophic losses
that might otherwise deter entry of potential DCBs.  Would, for
example, a university hospital be willing to gamble its entire
financial resources on the opportunity to enter this novel and
potentially highly litigious area?  If it did so, the fees needed
to cover potential liability costs would provide a deterrent to
the testing of potentially beneficial new drugs.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The underlying rationale for strict liability
in the usual judicial context is that the company has a role beyond
not being negligent.  Rather, the firm should serve as the insurer
for the potential losses of accident victims and spread these
losses in much the same way as would an insurance company.  The
reasoning behind this is that the firm can pass along the cost
of the insurance to the customers who in effect will buy the insurance
for liability costs for pharmaceuticals or drugs as part of the
purchase price.  However, the additional insurance rationale is
not pertinent to whether the firm exercises appropriate care.
 The negligence doctrine alone is adequate to establishing these
incentives.  Moreover, it is not the DCB but rather the pharmaceutical
and medical device company that is marketing the product and has
the ability to spread the cost through the product price.  It
is, of course, true that the DCB can raise its fees to the companies,
which in turn can raise the product price.  Even in this instance,
however, this insurance analogy tends to break down in the case
of mass toxic torts and punitive damages.  Unanticipated awards,
such as those that resulted from the imposition of retroactive
liability, by their very nature cannot be recouped in the marketplace.
 Cases such as those that led to the bankruptcy or reorganization
of the affected firms likewise do not lend themselves to an insurance
role.  Moreover, the types of court awards that are made do not
simply provide insurance of medical costs and other income losses
of accident victims but instead provide for amounts well beyond
these losses.  Such awards will not be valued by prospective consumers
of the product since this is not the type of insurance they would
choose to purchase.  Consequently their cost will not be fully
reflected in the purchase price that consumers are willing to
pay.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The DCBs would, of course, have liability to
the companies as well as to potential consumers.  In particular,
the product certifier would have the responsibility of fulfilling
the terms of its contracts with its clients.  Thus, the certifier
would have the contractual duty to carry out these contract provisions
as well as the tort law duty to provide a workman-like service.<sup><a href="foot.html">34</a></sup>
 The DCB also is subject to the provisions of communicating the
results of its findings to the client.  If the DCB provides false
or inaccurate information, then it is subject to tort liability.<sup><a href="foot.html">35</a></sup>
 Under the theory of negligent misrepresentation the company could
potentially sue the DCB for providing false or inaccurate information.
 Thus, if the company suffered financial losses because of the
false information provided by the DCB and the DCB failed to exercise
reasonable care in obtaining and communicating the information,
then there is a potential basis for a negligence by the company
against the DCB.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The greater practical problem from the standpoint
of DCBs is not whether they are subject to potential liability
actions on the part of corporations purchasing its services but
rather whether third parties injured by the approved products
can obtain liability awards.  As a general rule, U.S. courts have
not found companies responsible for endorsing or certifying products
strictly liable for these defects.  However, a specific legal
exemption from strict liability could ensure that this is the
case and conclusively eliminate the threat of such suits.  The
underlying rationale that has been applied by the courts has been
that the product endorsers or testers are not directly involved
in the manufacturing or the distribution of the product so that
the usual rationales for strict liability are not appropriate.<sup><a href="foot.html">36</a></sup>
 For much the same reasoning, manufacturers have not been held
liable under the theories of breach of warranty.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Our plan's proposal that the DCBs be exposed
to third party suits on grounds of negligence is also consistent
with current legal doctrine in this area.  In situations in which
the courts have first determined that the testers or product certifiers
owed a duty of care to the general public, then negligence rules
have been applied.<sup><a href="foot.html">37</a></sup><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The underlying reasoning that has led to the
courts determining that product certifiers and testers are potentially
liable can be traced to two principles.  If the individual who
is harmed took actions that were based on reasonable reliance
on the information provided by the certifier/tester and if the
certifier/tester is negligent either in obtaining accurate information
or in presenting it then there is potential liability for whatever
physical harm results from the use of these products.  As a general
rule, companies that are responsible for supplying information
to the public and which will be relied upon by the public in making
their purchasing decisions do have a duty to consumers.<sup><a href="foot.html">38</a></sup>  Of course
in the case of the role of DCBs with respect to product certification,
this aspect of liability will be complicated by the fact that
the FDA has the final sign-off in this review process.  Thus,
it must be the case that it is the DCB and not the FDA that is
responsible for the negligence.  The key issue is whether the
DCB has been careless or negligent in carrying out its responsibilities,
which is a much narrower basis for liability than is the case
for the pharmaceutical companies.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >To summarize, the major changes being proposed
with respect to the liability system pertain both to the current
liability regime as well as the proposed new regulatory structure.
 In particular, the proposal models a regulatory compliance defense
for pharmaceuticals and devices both with respect to punitive
damages and liability more generally.  The plan proposals to revise
the FDA drug and device approval process would not alter the pertinence
or applicability of these legal reforms.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The specific new legal issues that are raised
by the reform proposals pertain to the potential liability of
the DCBs.  If this potential liability is substantial, then entry
into this market will be discouraged and the desired competition
will not be forthcoming.  For the most part, the desired legal
changes needed to accompany this new regulatory mechanism simply
involve clarification of the existing legal structure to eliminate
residual uncertainties.  Potential contractual liability of the
DCBs to the companies purchasing their services would be present
and is entirely appropriate.  The greater dangers are those posed
by strict liability and negligence claims involving the products
tested by the DCBs.  Past legal precedent suggests that strict
liability claims are unlikely to be upheld by the court, but to
eliminate the risk of potentially catastrophic losses we propose
that there be a formal legal exemption from strict liability suits.
 As under the current legal regime, DCBs would be subject to potential
suits with respect to negligence, as indeed they should since
one would want to preserve the incentives for them to carry out
their duties in an efficient manner.<BR>

<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>

<P>
<FONT >The pharmaceutical and medical device industry
is in many respects an anomaly with respect to its legal status.
 This industry has been the target of some of the most pathbreaking
and costly product liability suits.  Indeed, not only is the liability
burden for the pharmaceutical and medical device industry quite
high, it is extremely disproportionate to its sales when compared
to other manufacturing industries.  By almost any objective standard,
the pharmaceutical industry is an outlier in terms of the extent
to which it has been hard hit by the rise in liability costs.
 These liability costs have been of substantial practical consequence,
as they have served as a deterrent to innovation and have discouraged
entry into important areas of product development.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >What is perhaps most disturbing about these
high liability costs is that they have been coupled with a regulatory
regime that is extremely stringent, certainly more stringent than
what is in place for any other major class of consumer products.
 Pharmaceutical products are subjected to extensive pre-market
testing and even extensive review before they are permitted to
be tested.  After having been tested and shown to be both safe
and effective, pharmaceutical products are marketed under restricted
market conditions in which a physician must prescribe prescription
drugs before they can be purchased.  In addition, the product
is accompanied by an on-product warning or a patient package insert,
the wording of which is specifically approved by the Food and
Drug Administration and is in large part drafted by the Food and
Drug Administration to be in conformance with a standardized warnings
vocabulary.  After the products are on the market, the Food and
Drug Administration undertakes considerable effort with respect
to surveillance of products and monitoring of adverse effects
that are reported to it.  This extremely vigorous regulatory regime
ensures that the usual tort liability objective of striking an
appropriate balance in the promotion of safety for the product
has been achieved.  Indeed, most critics of the FDA suggest that
the FDA errs on the side of excessive caution leading to too few
innovative new drugs reaching the market.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >In the presence of such stringent regulatory
criteria, one wonders why the pharmaceutical industry has been
the object of such extensive litigation.  The reason is not that
the FDA's judgements were in error.  Rather, in some cases new
information becomes apparent over time, which could not have been
known by either the company or by the FDA without even a more
extensive testing process that would have delayed potentially
beneficial drugs from reaching the market even longer.  More important
is that in a regime of strict liability the company will assume
responsibility for insuring any adverse outcomes that occur in
any patient population group.  In some cases there may be adverse
reactions to a drug that lead to a patient injury and a subsequent
lawsuit.  In other instances, the causality may be difficult to
ascertain.  Pharmaceutical companies with their relatively deep
pockets may be held accountable for the losses even though their
product did not in fact cause the injury.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The liability regime we propose would remedy
the inequities created by a liability system that currently imposes
stringent penalties on an industry that already is subject to
extensive regulatory requirements.  A strong regulatory compliance
defense would recognize the role that FDA standards play in addressing
the product safety issue.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >Other legal issues are also created by a broader
reform effort.  Under the proposed regulatory process for pharmaceuticals
and medical devices outlined here, DCBs would be potentially subject
to suits from both companies purchasing their services as well
as injured plaintiffs.  Suits on the part of companies that are
attempting to hold the DCBs to their contractual obligations are
entirely appropriate and should be permitted.  In addition, suits
against the DCBs on the basis of negligence in carrying our their
review functions also are appropriate.  At present, certifiers
such as Underwriters' Laboratory are not typically subject to
strict liability.  Nevertheless, it is appropriate to give DCBs
a formal exemption from strict liability in order to eliminate
the low probability chance of a high loss event that may lead
to the insolvency of the DCB.  The prospect of such suits would
deter entry into the DCB arena, which would not be a desirable
outcome.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT >The legal proposals accompanying our plan simply
involve recognition of the need for a regulatory compliance defense
and codifying the existing legal regime to provide a degree of
assurance that the current legal landscape will not be altered
in a way that will affect DCBs adversely.  Given the past performance
of the liability system, such as the imposition of retroactive
liability in the asbestos cases, the need for a safe harbor for
DCBs even on a limited basis may be desirable in reducing unreasonable
exposures to liability.  The overall objective of legal sanctions
is to maintain the incentives for efficient behavior on the part
of DCBs, and this can be done by adopting the legal reforms that
we have proposed.</FONT>

<P>
<ol>
<li> Clearly, the FDA reports to more than one
Congressional committee, so that the Weingast and Moran argument
is more complicated than the idea of a single, dominant overseer.
 Also, it is not clear that the FDA has responded much to advice
to loosen up, which suggests that it is more of a captive of committees
which criticize the agency for being too easy on industry.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<li>  The following discussion is meant to be
suggestive of how to analyze this case in slightly more formal
terms.  It can be skipped without loss of continuity.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<li>   An important semantical point needs to
be made here. Self-certification in the present discussion simply
means letting the market work, including the adoption of the standards
under which self-certification would take place. In other contexts
in this study self-certification will mean letting firms meet
an exogeneously determined set of standards (e.g., for Class I
medical devices) on their own. Government is not involved in the
former case, while it is involved in setting and policing standards
in the latter case.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<li>  The &quot;lemons&quot; problem resides in
the fact that buyers do not know the true quality of products
before they purchase and use them.  Hence, they tend to overvalue
lower quality products and to undervalue higher quality products.
 This means that only the lower quality products will be sold
in market equilibrium.  Owners of higher quality products will
not supply them for sales because they are systematically undervalued
by the market.  The market for used cars may be used as an example
of the &quot;lemons&quot; problem.  The analysis can also be translated
to the market for medical treatment. There is a pervasive history
of fraud in medical treatment and a tendency for the system to
degenerate into scams. The ease of fraud and scams is the reason
alternative medicines are so popular, such as shark cartilage
for cancer and arthritis treatment.<BR>

The vast majority of these applications are 510(k) &quot;notifications&quot;.
In 1994 there were a total of 5,498 510(k) decisions approving
the claim of substantial equivalence and 135 decisions disapproving
the claim, while there were only 43 Premarket Approval (PMA) applications.
The number of 510(k) applications was little changed during the
period 1988 through 1994 while the number of PMA applications
decreased by a factor of two.</FONT>

Medical Device &amp; Diagnostic Industry. 16(8):26-28, 1994. Dickinson
cites testimony before the Senate Governmental Affairs/Regulation
and Governmental Information Subcommittee explaining why Du Pont
no longer supplies biomedical materials. For one implant alone,
Du Pont has expended $8 million dollars per year for 5 years to
defend itself against 259 liability cases (of which it won 258).
&quot;Each implant contained about five cents's worth of Teflon.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<li>  The 1938 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic
Act gave the FDA statutory authority to take regulatory action
if a device was produced under unsanitary conditions, was dangerous
if used as directed, or it's labeling was misleading, did not
contain adequate instructions for use or did not identify the
manufacturer. For a legislative history of device regulation through
the late 1980's see: Hutt PB, A History of Government Regulation

<li>  Kessler DA, Pape SM, Sundwall DN. The Federal
Regulation of Medical Devices. New England Journal of Medicine
317:357-66, 1987. In this article, Dr. Kessler (before he became
FDA Commissioner) wrote: &quot;the FDA's extensive reliance on
the 510(k) pathway to reduce the number of devices that require
premarketing approval - and consequently its own workload - is
destined to fail. As technology advances, the number of devices
legitimately found to be substantially equivalent to devices marketed
before 1976 will diminish markedly. If the FDA does not soon develop
other acceptable mechanisms for dealing with new devices, practical
considerations will force it to stretch the statute further, making
the regulation of medical devices even more perplexing.&quot;</FONT>

<li>  FDA Office of Device Evaluation, personal
communication (December 13, 1995). The use of median times obscures
the fact that the distribution is skewed towards longer times.
Thus the mean elapsed time in 1994 was 216 days.</FONT>
<P>
<li>  Wilkerson Group (1995), p. 78.</FONT>
<P>
<li>  The 1976 Food Drug and Cosmetic Act at least
technically offered the opportunity for the manufacturer to market
a device under section 510(k) 90 days after notification of the
FDA. The 1990 amendments removed this option and the manufacturer,
under the threat of severe penalties, must await an FDA &quot;order&quot;
giving permission to go to market.</FONT>
<P>
<li>  Briones (1995), p. 17. Statistical analysis
of data based on the date the PMA was submitted, by necessity,
does not include PMA's that were still pending at the time of
analysis. When these PMA's are finally acted upon, perhaps many
years after originally submitted, the average elapsed time will
increase. This phenomenon is more important for PMA's than 510(k)'s
as they typically require much more time and are not acted upon
in the year that they are filed.</FONT>
<P>
<li>  Wilkerson Group (1995), pp. 78-89. This
contains an economic model of the costs of regulatory delay using
estimates of the time required for device approvals in the United
States and the European Union. The model is based on survey data.
Of the companies surveyed, 61 percent market products offshore
before marketing in the United States. Sixty nine percent anticipated
that the delay would be between 1 and 3 years (pp. 89-91).</FONT>

<li>  George WW. Which Way FDA?. Medical Device
&amp; Diagnostic Industry. 17(12):22-24, 1995. William George,
CEO of Medtronics, states that of their &quot;last 15 major new
product lines or ventures, all have been developed, tested and
produced first in Europe. All will be available first to patients
overseas well before they are introduced to patients in the United
States. Overall, the gap between commercial availability of new
therapies in Europe and the United States has widened from 1 to
2 years to 5 to 7 years.&quot; The author has heard similar statements
from knowledgeable sources in the American device industry.</FONT>
<P>
<li>  In 1994, the Gallop Organization interviewed
58 executives of member companies of the American Electronics
Association and prepared a &quot;Survey of Medical Device Manufacturers
Concerning the Strategic and Economic Impact of the Federal Regulatory
Process.&quot; They looked at the impact of the experience of
these companies with the current 510(k) approval process. Fifteen
percent of these executives reported that their experience has
led them to relocate manufacturing operations outside of the United
States, 35% reported placing a greater emphasis on R&amp;D outside
the U.S. and 59% reported that more products are released outside
the U.S. that in the past.</FONT>
<P>
<li>  Commissioner Kessler in his April 6, 1995
statement before the Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources
stated that &quot;Today, the Clinton Administration is announcing
a number of initiatives to improve the speed and efficiency of
the drug and device review process... I would like to submit for
the record FDA's report on regulatory reform in drug and medical
device review. These reforms ... have been developed under the
leadership of Vice President Gore's National Performance Review...
Some of the reforms we announce speak directly to reduced time
for review and approval. Others aim to reduce excessive regulatory
burdens... They will result ... in annual cost savings for industry
of $500 million.&quot; There is currently little debate concerning
whether reform is needed. The only question is which reforms are
best.</FONT>
<P>
<li>  The FDA has recently announced it's &quot;policy
on the development of standards with respect to international
harmonization of regulatory requirements and guidelines&quot;
(Federal Register, vol. 60, no. 196, pp.53078-84, October 11,
1995). The FDA states that &quot;harmonization enhances public
health protection and improves governmental efficiencies by reducing
both unwarranted contradictory regulatory requirements and redundant
applications of similar requirements by multiple regulatory bodies.&quot;
However, taken as a whole, the announced policy has so many caveats
that it is evident that the FDA is still not enthusiastically
embracing the harmonization of standards with Western Europe.
In fact the announcement overtly states that this &quot;policy
document does not ... bind FDA in any way.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<li>  European Council Directive of 14 June 1993
Concerning Medical Devices, Annex I, gives the details of the
14 essential requirements.</FONT>
<P>
<li>  The question of why the FDA, despite the
mandates of the 1976 law, failed to develop performance standards,
while the European system successfully relies upon them is elucidated
by Commissioner Kessler writing (NEJM 317:357-66, 1987) that &quot;the
development of 800 performance standards for the 800 types of
Class II devices, which has been estimated to require 50,000 staff
years, would probably exceed the capacity of the agency under
any circumstances.&quot;  In the European system there is no need
for a vast staff as they take full advantage of the myriad of
non-governmental standards setting bodies in a multitude of countries;
they have the flexibility to use generic standards as well as
standards that apply only to a single device; they, in many cases,
use standards to validate the manufacturer's quality assurance
systems instead of individual device standards; and finally they
allow the manufacture to devise <I>ad hoc</I> methods of proving
conformance with the &quot;essential requirements&quot; instead
of or to supplement relying on published standards. This approach
has allowed for more flexibility than relying primarily on a monolithic
federal agency.</FONT>
<P>
<li>  Annex IX of the Medical Device Directive
contains the details of the classification criteria.</FONT>
<P>
<li>  The full set of EU quality assurance standards
(which are similar to the ISO 9000 series of standards commonly
used in the United States) is equivalent to a super set of the
FDA's GMP requirements in that they also include standards for
ensuring the quality of the design process. The FDA has announced
that it intends to add design quality assurance to its GMP's in
the future.</FONT>
<P>
<li>  Magazine AH, Hunt MI. The U.S. Medical Device
Industry Moves Offshore. Medical Device &amp; Diagnostic Industry.
17(8):72-79, 1995. According to a recent survey, &quot;seventy
percent of all companies and 84% of development-stage firm moving
clinical trials offshore rate 'FDA uncertainty and unpredictability'
as a critical element in their decision.&quot;</FONT>
<P>
<li>  Wilkerson (1955) pp. 217-27. This lists
100 specific medical devices, currently available in Europe, Canada,
Australia and/or Japan, which are currently not available to patients
in the United States.  Eventual FDA approval is expected for most
of these products. In general, these devices relate to the diagnosis
and treatment of severe disease. For example, 31 of the 100 are
related to coronary artery disease, structural cardiac abnormalities
or congestive heart failure. To the extent that they are more
efficacious than devices currently available in the United States,
regulatory delay may be responsible for unnecessary morbidity
and mortality.</FONT>
<P>
<li>  Less than the Sum of its Parts (1993) p.
81. The House report states: &quot;Clinical utility is the Agency's
[FDA's] requirement that a device manufacturer prove not only
does the device work as claimed, but that patient's health also
improves as a result of the device's action.&quot; &quot;Since
... ODE is barely able to perform the review presently required
by statute, it makes little sense for it to add routinely the
burden of assessing clinical utility to its review process.&quot;
 There is a critical distinction between the EU's concept of requiring
evidence of clinical efficacy and the FDA's requirement for evidence
of clinical utility. The former is related to demonstrating that
the device has the claimed effect; the latter, that the device's
effect is clinically beneficial. For example, the manufacture
of a mechanical ventilator that breathes for a patient may claim
that it delivers large breath volumes at a slow rate. The EU system
would require that this claim be verified and that the gas really
goes into the patient's lungs as claimed; the FDA system would
require that it be shown that this type of ventilation is, in
some sense, good for some subset of patients. In the EU system,
such medical questions are normally outside the domain of the
device regulations (unless, of course, the device manufacturer
makes an implicit or explicit claim of clinical utility).</FONT>
<P>
<li>  Less than the Sum of its Parts (1993) pp.
71-3. This congressional report quotes the head of the FDA Division
of Product Surveillance as stating that the current device reporting
&quot;system doesn't work and everyone knows it doesn't.&quot;
The report concludes that &quot;The weakness of CDRH's MDR system
reflects an FDA-wide problem with its failure to use management
information systems effectively&quot; and that little has changed
since the GAO came to a similar conclusion in their 1989 report.
The report continues on p. 91: &quot;The MDR system currently
cannot serve as an early warning system ... and it makes little
sense to invest additional resources into this system given its
many flaws. The Agency's chronic problems in this area may make
it necessary to have an independent expert contractor develop
a practical and useful system.&quot; For devices, because they
way that they are actually used cannot be fully determined before
actual marketing, postmarket surveillance is at least as important
as premarket review. Fortunately, it is in the interest of responsible
manufacturers to have their own, generally very effective, systems
to act on device problems discovered in the post-marketing period.</FONT>

INTRODUCTION
<P>
       The full Senate is poised to vote on legislation to deregulate the
telecommunications industry.  Unfortunately, the leading bill, while a
modest improvement on current law, misses the opportunity to benefit
consumers by opening the industry to real competition.  If this leading U.S. 
industry is to live up to its potential, and consumers are to reap the rewards
of full competition and innovation, the Senate must make major changes in
the bill.
<P>
       Last year's telecommunications deregulation bill, S.  1822, died in
the Senate because of dissatisfaction with the overly regulatory approach
produced principally by Senator Ernest Hollings (D-SC).  Very late in the
legislative session, then Minority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS) began
circulating a draft deregulation bill that was a mere 30 pages long --
compared to the approximately 200-page Hollings bill.  Instead of granting
segments of the industry continued protection from competition, as the
Hollings bill did, the Dole draft legislation removed almost all barriers to
competition immediately.  For example, compared with the many pages of
regulation in S.  1822 dealing with Title VI of the Communications Act of
1934 (governing cable regulation), the Dole bill simply stated that "Title VI
of the Communications Act of 1934 is repealed."  This would have
deregulated the cable market completely upon implementation had the bill
become law.
<P>
       A choice of paradigms.  Thus, when members and key
telecommunications staffers on the Senate Commerce Committee began
meeting late last year to craft legislation for this session, they had a clear
choice of models:  S.  1822, which granted certain deregulatory freedoms
while still restraining competition in other ways, or the Dole draft
legislation to deregulate immediately and comprehensively almost all aspects
and segments of the telecommunications market.  Following the Dole model
would mean little to no intervention by bureaucrats and a more rapid
transition to complete market liberalization.
<P>
       Unfortunately, they have tried to craft a hybrid of both models.  The
result:  a bill that fails to create a clear, consistent, and unconstrained
environment for America's telecommunications industry.  During the early
weeks of this year, relatively "clean" legislation was revised many times,
with each revision moving further toward the Hollings model by adding
more regulatory baggage in an apparent effort to appease various segments
of the industry seeking to avoid new entrants into their markets.  Not
surprisingly, therefore, the first formal draft to emerge publicly from
Chairman Larry Pressler's (R-SD) office was, in many ways, already an
unsatisfactory compromise. 
<P>
        When the final bill emerged at a Senate Commerce Committee
mark-up on March 23, it was even less satisfactory than earlier drafts. 
Apparently in a last-minute effort to gain the support of several Democratic
members of the Commerce Committee, most deregulatory elements of the
bill were watered down.  Even so, many Democrats continued to express
reservations, and several pro-regulatory amendments were added to address
their concerns.  At the end of mark-up, the bill being sent to the floor
comprised close to 150 pages and contained almost 100 new rule-making
provisions for the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).  The
capitulation to the Hollings model was complete.
<P>
       To be sure, the bill contains some important improvements over
current law.  For example, the Pressler bill would:
<P>
Eliminate many important barriers to industry-wide competition,
<P>
Provide incentives to open the traditionally uncompetitive local market to
competition,
<P>
Eliminate elements of the 1992 Cable Act,
<P>
Allow somewhat increased foreign investment, and
<P>
Devise a system to scale back FCC powers.
<P>
       
       But these benefits are largely outweighed by provisions that retain
or extend suffocating rules.  For example:
<P>
Arbitrary FCC-administered "entry tests" could cause potentially lengthy
delays before competition is allowed in certain industry segments.
<P>
Some elements of the destructive Cable Act will remain in effect, and rules
regulating the video industry remain confusing.
<P>
Foreign ownership rules are relaxed only for a portion of U.S.  industry and
could be enforced retroactively after repeal.
<P>
No serious effort is made to eliminate the FCC or specific bureaus of the
agency; other rules in the bill could increase its size and power.
<P>
There is no serious reform of the electromagnetic radio spectrum to
encourage increased wireless competition and innovation.
<P>
The bill maintains and expands telecommunications entitlements that
discourage industry competition.
<P>
       After seeing this final bill, more deregulatory-minded legislators such
as Senator John McCain (R-AZ) were left asking, "Why do we need to
make a deal if it's a bad deal?"  Indeed, it is unclear why concessions
were made to industry special interests by the committee.  It is likely that
a bill modeled on the Dole draft of last year could win passage in both
houses of Congress.  However, now that one modeled more closely on the
Hollings approach has been adopted by the Commerce Committee, the
Senate must focus on how to improve S.  652, The Telecommunications
Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995.  If this legislation becomes law
as structured today, consumers will not be able to look forward to serious
telecommunications deregulation or competition in the short term.
<P>


WHAT IS GOOD AND BAD ABOUT THE PRESSLER PLAN
<P>
       The Pressler bill essentially is the product of two diametrically
opposed models of telecommunications deregulation.  Thus, both good and
bad elements can be found juxtaposed within the bill.  It is important to
separate the unneeded regulatory elements from the more sound deregulatory
components to consider what needs to be changed in the bill to create a
sound deregulatory environment for the industry.  One way to do this is to
compare the bill with a set of criteria for what could be considered true,
free-market-oriented deregulatory reform. 
<P>       
        Seven such general principles can be used to judge the deregulatory
nature of the bill: 
<P>
Creation of sensible interconnection policy to open the local market to
competition; 
<P>
Elimination of regulation and barriers to entry in the telephone market; 
<P>
Elimination of regulation and barriers to entry for the cable and video
market; 
<P>
Elimination of protectionist barriers to foreign investment; 
<P>
Sharp reduction of the telecommunications bureaucracy; 
<P>
Substantial movement toward a free market in spectrum; and 
<P>
Elimination of telecommunications entitlements.  
<P>

       Judged against these criteria, the bill earns a very mixed report card.
<P>
CRITERION #1:  Creation of a Sensible Interconnection Policy
<P>
Grade:  A 
<P>
Good Points:  A "competitive checklist" provides right incentives to open
local market to competition; does not apply policies too broadly.
<P>
Bad Points:  None.
<P>
       The Pressler bill creates a sensible interconnection policy to ensure
the local telephone market is opened to competition as soon as possible.  A
14-point "competitive checklist" is established that allows competitors access
to the "Baby Bell's" local telephone network.  This framework is based on
an "open access" philosophy, which encourages the expansion of rivals to
incumbent monopolistic carriers while preserving the ubiquitous nature of
the American telephone network.
<P>
       In addition, these access requirements are focused narrowly on less
competitive local markets where firms have traditionally been granted
service monopolies.  The Pressler bill wisely does not apply such access and
interconnection mandates on competitive sectors such as the cellular industry
where they would be counter-productive by discouraging the expansion of
infrastructure and competition.
<P>
CRITERION #2:  Elimination of Regulation and Barriers to Entry(Telephony) 
<P>Grade:  B-
<P>
Good Points:  Opens local telephone market to competition; allows new
rivals a chance to enter market.
<P>
Bad Points:  Allows for potentially lengthy and arbitrary FCC delays on
competition in other segments of the telephone market.  
<P>
       The Pressler bill encourages greater telephone competition by
eliminating all entry barriers to local telephone markets immediately.  This
means alternative providers, such as utility companies and cable companies,
would be allowed to enter the phone market.  This will encourage
competition from entirely different sectors and also help ensure that service
to many rural areas becomes competitive, since these firms already have the
needed infrastructure in place.
<P>
       However, many impediments either remain or are established by the
bill for the first time.  For example, the Senate should have allowed the
Baby Bells to enter the long-distance and equipment manufacturing markets
on a specific date or after they had met the "checklist" criteria discussed
above.  But a last-minute compromise in Committee deliberations eliminated
the "date-certain" or "checklist-certain" approach and substituted a new
"public interest" standard.  Thus, after complying successfully with the
checklist objectives, the Bells must face an arbitrary review of the benefits
of their entry into markets from which they are currently are barred.  If, for
any reason, FCC regulators feel Bell entry into these markets is not
"consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity," they can
block it.
<P>
       This is a disturbing and inferior standard upon which to base
telephone deregulation.  Deregulatory language should establish clear,
objective criteria by which firms can understand what must be done to
assure access to new markets.  Placing a "public interest" test within the bill
is an open invitation to anti-competitive special-interest pleading and
regulatory abuse, since the standard is largely subjective.  In addition,
allowing the FCC to interpret what is in the "public interest" introduces a
perverse incentive for FCC officials to slow down deregulation:  smoothing
the way for competition would mean a corresponding decrease in their
workload and little continued need for their agency's existence.
<P>
       The inclusion of this anti-competitive "public interest" test reduces
the grade the Pressler bill receives for elimination of barriers to telephone
competition, since beneficial Bell entry into new markets will be delayed. 
According to the WEFA Group, this delay could result in approximately
$300 billion in lost economic output and 3.4 million lost jobs over the next
ten years.  With such economic costs, it makes little sense to include
language in the bill delaying entry, especially since Baby Bell power in
local markets is dwindling.
<P>
       In addition, although the Pressler bill makes a half-hearted attempt
to eliminate the constraints placed on the seven Baby Bell companies under
the Modification of Final Judgment consent decree of 1982, no attempt is
made to supersede the consent decree that continues to restrain the GTE
Corporation.  Under a 1984 decree struck with the Department of Justice,
GTE is discouraged from entering many of the same lines of businesses the
Baby Bells are via structural safeguards and specific regulatory restraints. 
Thus, the Bells could be granted operating freedoms much sooner than GTE
under the Pressler bill, resulting in an uneven playing field.
<P>
       Finally, the Pressler bill does little to remove more traditional
regulatory barriers to telephone competition.  Elements of the original
Communications Act of 1934, such as licensing, tariffing, and other
operating requirements, have always been a burden on the industry.  For
example, Section 214 gives the Commission the power to approve or deny
the extension of phone lines and services to consumers.  In addition, the
Commission requires that telephone firms file schedules of their rates, or
"tariffs," with the agency for public inspection.  Although it makes little
sense for the Commission to be determining whether a company should be
extending services and requiring firms to reveal their rates to competitors,
the Pressler bill does not eliminate these uncompetitive and costly
regulations. 
<P>
CRITERION # 3:  Elimination of Regulation and Barriers to Entry
(Cable and Video)
<P>
Grade:  B-
<P>
Good Points:  Eliminates cable-telco cross-ownership restrictions.
<P>
Bad Points:  Does not repeal Cable Act outright; maintains asymmetrical
regulatory standard for video delivery.
<P>
       Recognizing that the Cable Act of 1992 has been a failure, early
drafts of the Pressler bill contained language calling for the repeal of the
Act and prohibiting any future cable rate regulation.  Unfortunately, a series
of last-minute compromises resulted in retention of the Cable Act, albeit
with important modifications.  In essence, cable rates under the Pressler bill
will be regulated if they "substantially exceed the national rate for
comparable cable programming services."  However, if a telephone company
provides video services in a cable operator's territory, rate regulation will
not apply.
<P>
       In addition, instead of eliminating all regulations governing the
delivery of video programming, the bill mandates continuation of a
confusing twofold standard -- one for video signals carried by telephone
wires and one for video signals carried over cable systems.  In essence, this
means that an asymmetrical regulatory standard for the delivery of video
programming will continue to exist.
<P>
CRITERION #4:  Elimination of Protectionist Barriers           
<P>
Grade:  C +
<P>
Good Points:  Potentially allows increased foreign investment and
competition in the common carrier market.
<P>
Bad Points:  Retroactive protectionist provisions could be enforced; ignores
radio licenses.
<P>
       The Pressler bill undertakes a long-needed reform of rules restricting
foreign ownership of American telecommunications companies.  Since 1934,
foreign entities have been effectively prohibited from owning more than 20
percent of the shares of a company holding a radio license or more than 25
percent of the shares of a company holding a common carrier telephone
license.  Foreigners also are not allowed to sit on the board or become an
officer of a radio licensee or a common carrier licensee. 
<P>
        The Pressler bill aims to eliminate the 25 percent cap on common
carrier ownership for any country that has opened its markets to American
goods.  But it does nothing about the 20 percent radio ownership ceiling. 
Furthermore, the bill contains a potentially retroactive "snapback" provision
that allows U.S.  regulators to re-impose protectionist barriers on countries
that fail to provide continued market access to U.S.  firms.
<P>
       While the Pressler bill is superior to current law on foreign
ownership, it still falls short of compete reform.  Exempting radio licenses
from the liberalization makes little sense, and the retroactive snapback
clause will likely be used by less-efficient U.S.  firms to close the American
market when foreign competition becomes intense. 
<P>
 CRITERION #5:  Reduction of Telecommunications Bureaucracy
<P>
Grade:  D-

<P>Good Points:  Eliminates some tasks over time and devises a process to
review regulations.
<P>
Bad Points:  Requires increased telecom spending and bureaucracy in short
term; no end in sight for the FCC.
<P>
       The Pressler bill will eliminate some of the telecommunications
bureaucracy simply by eliminating the regulations it enforces.  In addition,
beginning in 1997, it requires a biennial review of regulations by the FCC
to determine which rules are no longer in the "public interest."  Likewise,
the FCC does not have to enforce any regulations it feels are not in the
public interest.
<P>
       However, the bill does not contain any serious discussion of the
future of the Federal Communications Commission.  Policymakers appear
unconcerned with the role the agency plays in the deregulatory process and
apparently do not realize it is part of the problem they hope to correct. 
Congress should follow the model established by congressional Democrats
and the Carter Administration in the late 1970s when they led the battle to
deregulate the airlines.  From the start, the future of the Civil Aeronautics
Board (CAB), which regulated the airline industry, was on the table.  It was
well understood by most in Congress that deregulating the airlines would
mean eliminating the CAB.  A few years later, the CAB was abolished. 
<P>
        Yet, not only does the Pressler bill fail to mention the future of the
FCC, but many provisions discussed above or found elsewhere in the bill
actually will increase the size of the telecommunications bureaucracy.  For
example, new universal service provisions, "public access" requirements,
content controls, and separate subsidiary safeguards undoubtedly will
require additional FCC enforcement and staff.  Likewise, "public interest"
tests and continued licensing and tariffing requirements probably will require
stable or increasing FCC bureaucracy.
<P>
       Although Section 3 of the Pressler bill is titled "An End to
Regulation," there is no end in sight to the telecommunications bureaucracy. 
Congress could address FCC staffing and funding issues during the
appropriations process, but it is unwise to rely on Appropriations or Budget
Committee members to carry out a task that should be handled within the
bill itself.
<P>
CRITERION #6:  Movement Toward a Free Market in Spectrum
<P>
Grade:  F
<P>
Good Points:  None.
<P>
Bad Points:  No serious reform of the radio spectrum.
<P>
       The opportunities presented by complete liberalization and
privatization of the radio spectrum are enormous.  Billions of dollars in
revenue could be raised through the expansion of spectrum auctions.  More
important, if spectrum was freed for new or alternative uses, consumers
would benefit from more competitive markets, more innovative goods and
services, and falling prices.
<P>
              Sadly, the Pressler bill does not make a serious effort to
exploit these opportunities.  It contains moderate relaxation of national
ownership restrictions on broadcasters, but this falls short of the position,
held even by the FCC, that the rule should be repealed outright. 
Furthermore, many other ownership restrictions remain in the bill which
restrict the ability of broadcasters to operate freely. 
<P>
        Worse yet, the bill makes no attempt to end the nearly seven-
decade-old socialistic spectrum management policies of the FCC.  Spectrum
remains treated as a nationalized public resource to be regulated in the
"public interest" -- meaning, in reality, as the Commission sees fit.  Hence,
spectrum holders will continue to be denied flexible use of their current
spectrum allocation, while no move is made to vest them with property
rights in their allocation.  In addition, although the Pressler bill hopes to
create more efficient spectrum use by instituting a system of fees for
particular uses, the Commerce Committee missed the chance to move to a
superior, efficiency-enhancing system of complete privatization.  This would
have ensured that spectrum was auctioned off to the highest bidder and
owned by the firm that valued it most highly.  It also would have generated
billions of dollars for the federal government.  Moreover, broadcasters will
continue to be regulated under a "public interest model" under the bill, with
only limited First Amendment protections.  Remarkably, the Pressler bill
makes no mention of the First Amendment.
<P>
       As with the scaling back of telecommunications bureaucracy,
spectrum reform technically could take place later in a separate bill.  But the
opportunity for more comprehensive and immediate spectrum deregulation
is missed in the Pressler bill.
<P>
CRITERION #7:  Elimination of Telecommunications Entitlements
<P>
Grade:  F
<P>
Good Points:  None.
<P>
Bad Points:  Expands telecom subsidies; gives FCC larger role; potentially
regulates computer industry.
<P>
       The most disastrous elements of the Pressler bill are the sections
dealing with universal telecommunications service.  Current telephone
subsidy policies redistribute wealth in a highly inefficient manner to provide
cheap local telephone service.  Subsidies generally flow from long-distance
users to local users, business users to residential users, and urban users to
rural users.  These overlapping cross-subsidies have destroyed industry
competition by discouraging market entry, since few potential competitors
have the capital necessary to take on the subsidized firms.  By artificially
elevating prices in the long-distance market, these subsidies also have cost
society between $1.5 billion to $10 billion per year in higher prices. 
<P>
        Instead of attempting to reform or eliminate this destructive subsidy
system, the Pressler bill actually expands its scope.  For example, the bill:
<P>
Maintains current price controls by requiring that services be provided at
"just, reasonable, and affordable rates," and does not define what these
highly subjective terms mean.
<P>
Continues inefficient rate averaging, which requires that rates in rural areas
be roughly the same as those in urban areas, regardless of cost.
<P>
Expands telecommunications entitlements by mandating that, "At a
minimum, universal service shall include access to telecommunications
services that the Commission determines have, through the operation of
market choices by consumers, been subscribed to by a majority of
residential consumers."
<P>
       The continuation of the failed subsidy policies of the past, combined
with the expanding definition of universal service mandated under the bill,
places at risk almost everything else the bill hopes to accomplish.  Once
personal computers, on-line services, set-top boxes, and other future
technologies become part of a package of mandated benefits to which every
American must have access, it is likely these technologies will be regulated,
and thus made less competitive.  Although the bill does not specifically
require that these goods and services be included in a package of mandated
technological benefits, the Pressler draft has provided the FCC with the
incentive to do so by requiring that universal service be considered an
"evolving level of telecommunications service."  It is likely this will
encourage the agency to adopt traditional subsidization and regulatory
measures to extend these technologies to more Americans once they are
included in the evolving definition. 
<P>
        If this occurs and these markets become less competitive, consumers
will have less choice, higher prices, and perhaps even less access to these
technologies.  As the above chart illustrates, it is significant that
unsubsidized and unregulated technologies have been made available to
American consumers much faster than subsidized and regulated
technologies, such as telephone technology. 
<P>
        In addition, it will be more difficult to make the local telephone
market competitive, as the bill aspires to do.  This is because real price
competition will not be allowed to develop freely if subsidies remain in
place.  Further, it is unclear just how expensive it will be to carry out these
new provisions.  And although these mandates may not be considered
technically a tax increase, since the subsidies flow within the industry and
not from a general revenue fund, they will have the effect of a
redistributionist tax and likely will require an increase in the size of the
FCC.
<P>
HOW TO IMPROVE THE PRESSLER BILL
<P>
       If the Senate wishes to correct the flaws in the Pressler bill, several
changes must be made before the bill is passed.  Specifically, to create real
competition in the telecommunications industry, Congress should:
Strip out all unnecessary bureaucratic impediments to immediate
deregulation, such as the "public interest" test, licensing and tariffing
requirements, delays in equipment manufacturing liberalization, separate
subsidiary requirements, and all rate regulation provisions.
<P>
       There is little need to delay the onset of complete deregulation and
competition.  For six decades, consumers and entrepreneurial firms have
been forced to sit on the sidelines and watch bureaucrats conduct a
regulatory experiment that has ended in failure.  Immediate deregulation will
ensure that telecommunications companies face a much more ruthless
regulator -- the American consumer.  Policymakers cannot create
competition with waiting periods and bureaucratic entry tests.
<P>
Strip out retroactive foreign ownership provisions and eliminate
telecommunications protectionism.
<P>
       Instead of continuing to deny American consumers the benefits of
increased rivalry, competition, and service quality, as the Pressler bill would,
Congress should repeal these protectionist provisions in current law.  It
makes little sense to continue restrictions on foreign ownership of American
firms when so many diverse media and communication outlets exist.  Some
countries like the United Kingdom and New Zealand have liberalized
completely their telecommunications markets and enjoy the benefits of
increased capital investment and entrepreneurial foreign competition.
<P>
       To help pry open foreign markets, the White House should pursue
a multilateral trade agreement in this area.  This would be less likely to fuel
the fires of protectionism and avert the chance of a trade war that would
threaten U.S.  investment abroad.  Instead, the Pressler bill attempts to keep
one foot in the protectionist camp while slowly stretching the other toward
the free market.  Unconditionally opening the American telecommunications
sector to foreign investment and competition will lower prices, produce
more innovative products, and create new jobs.  Continuing current
restrictions on foreign access to the American marketplace will hurt U.S. 
consumers more than any foreign firm conceivably might.
<P>
       
Require immediate and unconditional repeal of the Cable Act and all
video regulation.
<P>
       Policymakers must recognize that the Cable Act has done nothing to
advance the interests of consumers.  Although the cable industry has not
been cost competitive in the past, that is due more to misguided regulatory
policies than to any natural market outcome.  The Cable Act of 1992 should
have focused on opening the cable market to competition, not on applying
new price regulations.  Not only have the new regulations resulted in
smaller gains for consumers, but they have restricted the cable industry's
ability to invest in new technologies and to compete in new markets. 
Congress should repeal the Cable Act and all cable regulation and focus on
opening the market to competition from alternative video providers.  In
addition, alternative video providers should be placed on equal footing with
cable carriers to achieve deregulatory parity.  This would serve the interests
of consumers better than any current price or entry regulation.
Define the "public interest" as the best interests of consumers, to ensure that
regulators cannot use the term for other purposes.
<P>
       Throughout the Pressler bill, the FCC is given the ability to regulate
or deregulate according to what the agency believes is in "the public
interest."  Congress would be wise to eliminate any mention of this from the
bill, specifically entry tests based upon the "public interest" standard.  But
if Congress insists on maintaining this standard, it should try at least to
reduce the potential for regulatory abuse by defining the term as clearly and
objectively as possible.  Six decades of unconstrained "public interest"
regulation has demonstrated that what the FCC determines arbitrarily to be
in the "public interest," rarely is in the best interests of consumers.  The
reason is simple -- regulators, not consumers, are making the decision.
<P>
       Congress should define the public interest standard in statute if
lawmakers insist (unwisely) on keeping it in the legislation.  The definition
should focus on three specific criteria:
Maximizing consumer welfare by broadening the general scope of individual
decision-making within telecommunications markets;
Utilizing market processes instead of regulatory proceedings whenever
possible; and
<P>
Protecting property and First Amendment rights in telecommunications
regulation.
<P>
       This "consumer welfare" standard would better serve the interests of
all Americans.  But Congress also should consider defining what would
not be in the public interest.  This should include any action that constitutes
taxation by regulation, such as current universal service mechanisms. 
Other arbitrary regulatory practices could be included in this general
definition.
<P>
Include provisions granting the FCC authority to conduct auctions to
privatize the spectrum and eliminate all ownership restrictions on
spectrum allocations.
<P>
       The Pressler bill missed a rare opportunity to de-nationalize one of
America's most important and valuable natural resources -- the radio
spectrum.  Congress should give the Commission the authority to use
spectrum auctions whenever there are competing interests for a spectrum
allocation.  This will allow the FCC to sell off most if not all of the
remaining spectrum to those who value its use most highly, thereby ensuring
that it will be used much more efficiently.  Once spectrum is auctioned off,
property rights in the spectrum should be created and enforced by a small
panel or the courts.  Holders of spectrum property rights should be given
complete operating flexibility to use their allocation however they see fit. 
Incumbent holders of spectrum licenses should be given an absolute property
right in their holding.
<P>
       Creating spectrum property rights and broadening current auction
authority to include all competing uses would generate potentially hundreds
of billions of dollars in revenue and spur more innovation within wireless
markets.  In addition, it would create more competition for landline voice
and video operators.
<P>
Mandate equal First Amendment protection for all media, whether print
or electronic.
<P>
       Since the inception of electronic communications technologies (such
as radio, TV, and cable), First Amendment protections have been all but
ignored by regulators.  Congress should make it clear that the First
Amendment plays a pre-eminent role in the future of this industry.  To
accord second-class speech protections to the electronic media is a gross
violation of the rights of communications broadcasters and carriers.
<P>
       As traditional print technologies (such as newspapers and magazines)
converge with modern electronic technologies (such as the Internet), it will
become increasingly difficult to determine how to separate the different print
and electronic standards.  For example, will the New York Times be
regulated under a different interpretation of the First Amendment once it can
be delivered to most Americans via computer or cable system?  Existing
regulatory distinctions distort the true meaning and intent of the First
Amendment:  "The First Amendment, after all, does not distinguish one
'press' from another."
<P>
Include a timetable for closing down the FCC.
<P>
       A failure to reduce the size of the bureaucracy that governs the
telecommunications sector is a failure to deregulate this industry.  As long
as regulators have jobs, they will regulate.  If there is to be full deregulation
of this industry, Congress must devise a detailed and workable plan for the
eventual closure of the Federal Communications Commission. 
Unfortunately, with so many provisions in the Pressler bill expanding the
federal regulatory workload, this goal cannot be achieved unless the bill is
amended significantly. 
<P>
        Lawmakers should eliminate the bill's expansionary language and
substitute a plan to close down the FCC.  Congress should begin by
reducing current FCC appropriations and including procedural reforms in the
bill to end destructive regulatory activities.  For example, all licensing and
tariffing restrictions could be repealed immediately, resulting in substantial
cutbacks in bureaucracy.  Likewise, entire FCC bureaus, such as the Cable
Services Bureau, could be eliminated as the rules they enforce are repealed. 
<P>
 Substitute a more pro-competition alternative for the current universal
service sections of the bill.
<P>
       If policymakers fail to eliminate the language in the Pressler bill that
would expand subsidies and entitlements, telecommunications competition
could be stifled and current technologies could be made less competitive. 
Instead of adopting the failed model of the past, Congress should craft
policies in this field that fit the new thinking on entitlement reform on
Capitol Hill. 
<P>
        Just as some other entitlements are being limited and then devolved
to the states, universal telecommunications service policies can be
transferred to lower levels of government.  States and localities can
determine better what their residents need.  Ideally, state or local lawmakers
could create a voucher plan that would deliver a subsidy directly to a
qualified individual, not a company, based on perceived need.
<P>
         The subsidy would be narrowly drawn, means-tested, and more
friendly to competition -- unlike policies today that artificially price service
in rural areas below costs.  By transferring all authority for the universal
service system back to the states, Congress could eliminate the federal
bureaucracy that oversees the universal service system.
<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
       Although it would be unfortunate if telecommunications deregulation
legislation died this year, as it did last year, it would not be the proverbial
end of the world.  For one thing, technologies and the courts are
undermining or dismantling many of the barriers now in place.  With each
passing year, technological innovation circumvents outdated regulatory
distinctions, and court decisions are eliminating many regulatory barriers
outright.  These trends are likely to continue.  Another reason to reject
flawed legislation is that the Pressler bill actually would make some things
worse.  In particular, the universal service elements place at risk everything
else the bill hopes to accomplish by mandating the continuation and
expansion of failed subsidy policies.
<P>
              Still, supporters of the bill will argue correctly that allowing
the perfect to be the enemy of the good can destroy any chance of freeing
the industry from many statutory constraints on competition and innovation. 
They will cite the length and heavy cost of court-based deregulation and the
economic losses associated with continuing restrictions for longer than
necessary.  However, if supporters feel this passionately about the need for
immediate deregulation, they will act to eliminate the overly regulatory
baggage of the bill and insert more deregulatory, pro-competitive
alternatives in its place.  Without such changes, S.  652 as currently written
is not the landmark telecommunications deregulation bill its sponsors claim,
since it continues to rely more on regulators than consumers to decide which
firms and technologies prevail in the marketplace.

<a href="#five">FIVE AMENDMENTS TO MAKE THE BILL TRULY DEREGULATORY</a><br>
<a href="#conclusion">CONCLUSION</a><p>
<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>

	Following the recent Senate passage of S. 652, the Telecommunications Competition 
and Deregulation Act of 1995, the House of Representatives is ready to act on companion 
legislation, H.R. 1555, the Communications Act of 1995. The chief sponsors of this legislation 
are Representatives Thomas Bliley (R-VA), John Dingell (D-MI), and Jack Fields (R-TX). 
Unfortunately, like the Senate bill, the House bill fails to take the many important steps needed 
to deregulate, completely and comprehensively, all aspects of this industry. Worse yet, the House 
bill actually adds new regulatory powers to an already bloated federal bureaucracy. If Congress 
hopes to produce landmark deregulatory telecommunications legislation this year, the House 
must make important changes in the bill.<p>

<a name="what's"></a><h4>WHAT'S RIGHT AND WRONG WITH THE BILL</h4><p>
[ <a href="#content">Contents</a> ]<p>
	Although H.R. 1555 does include some positive incremental improvements in current 
law, it needs to go much further to achieve real reform. The bill takes important steps toward 
liberalizing the telecommunications market. For example, like its Senate counterpart, H.R. 1555:<p> 
<b>
<ul>
 <li>Eliminates many important barriers to industry-wide competition in both voice and 
video markets,

 <li>Provides incentives to open the traditionally uncompetitive local market to competition,

  <li>Eliminates elements of the 1992 Cable Act, and

  <li>Somewhat liberalizes broadcast ownership restrictions.
</ul>
</b>
However, the legislation also is riddled with unnecessary regulation and new mandates. For 
instance, the bill purports to establish a framework to minimize bureaucracy and regulation, yet 
contains well over 100 new rule-making provisions for the Federal Communications 
Commission alone. According to FCC Chairman Reed Hundt, the agency "will need substantial 
resources" to implement the legislation. "We'll need economists, statisticians, and business 
school graduates." (1)  Testifying at a June 19 House hearing, Hundt noted the agency would need a 
substantial increase in funding next year because passage of the legislation would put the agency 
"on the verge of a prodigiously detailed undertaking." (2)<p>  
	This beefed-up activity may be the type of "deregulation" that FCC bureaucrats like, but 
it is very different from what most industry experts and consumers would view as true 
deregulation.<p>

	Among its disturbing regulatory provisions, H.R. 1555:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Establishes excessive entry tests for Baby Bell companies seeking to enter long-distance 
markets.</b> Before removing outdated restrictions on Baby Bell entrance into the long-distance 
market, H.R. 1555 requires the companies to meet a series of standards to prove their local 
market is open to competition. Yet, the bill contains a perverse incentive that makes meeting 
these standards very difficult.<p>

	Before the Bells are deregulated, they must prove they face regional "facilities-based 
competitors" that offer comparable network service to both business and residential 
customers. However, they also must prove they are providing access to their own networks at 
"economically feasible rates" to allow competitors to resale service through the Bell 
infrastructure. This would create a perverse incentive, because competitors are unlikely to 
build a competing network if they can resale off the Bells' network at low rates. Competitors 
will find it more profitable to resale instead of building the competing infrastructure that 
needs to be present for the Bells to pass the "facilities-based" test. Consequently, Bell entry 
into long distance may be delayed for some time.<p>

		Another bill passed by the House Judiciary Committee could further complicate this 
process if it is included in H.R. 1555. The Antitrust Consent Decree Reform Act of 1995 
(H.R. 1528), sponsored by Representative Henry Hyde (R-IL), would add a role for the 
Department of Justice (DOJ) in determining whether a Bell should be granted access to the 
long-distance market. Basically, the DOJ could deny Bells access to that market if it found 
there was a "dangerous probability" they could monopolize another market. Combined with 
the excessively bureaucratic test already contained in H.R. 1555, this would place almost 
insurmountable obstacles on the path to operating freedom. Furthermore, consumers would 
be denied access to new competitors and their services.<p>

 <li><b>Requires that a separate subsidiary be established each time a telephone company 
wants to enter a new line of business</b>. Before a Baby Bell can enter long-distance, video 
services, or electronic publishing markets, it must establish an entirely separate entity to 
deliver that service. This means unnecessary duplication of facilities and staff, higher 
operating costs, and lower overall efficiency. The Bells should be allowed to enter a new line 
of business in any manner they find efficient and profitable, just as any other business can.<p>

  <li><b>Fails to eliminate barriers to international investment.</b>  Although an amendment to H.R. 
1555 allows some opening of the American market to foreign investment, such beneficial 
activity still would be delayed while the executive branch determined whether it was 
warranted. This would give provide American firms time to delay the liberalization process 
to discourage additional competition. Outright repeal would ensure a steady increase in the 
flow of capital to the American telecommunications market and a subsequent increase in job 
opportunities, just as free trade has accomplished in such other areas as computers and 
automobiles.<p>

  <li><b>Expands telecommunications entitlements.</b>  Like its Senate counterpart, H.R. 1555 expands 
uncompetitive and ineffective subsidies that flow to corporations instead of to individuals. 
The bill contains broad, open-ended mandates for the FCC and the states to design and 
deliver a more extensive package of communications services to all Americans, in part by 
manipulating the rates consumers pay for those services. <p>

		For example, subsidies generally flow from long-distance to local users, business to 
residential users, and urban to rural users. These overlapping cross-subsidies have destroyed 
industry competition by discouraging market entry, since few potential competitors have the 
capital necessary to take on the subsidized firms. (3)  By artificially elevating prices in the long-
distance market, these subsidies have cost society between $1.5 billion to $10 billion per year 
in higher prices. (4)  Because the House plan preserves and expands many of these mechanisms, 
it distorts market competition and fails to ensure access to more innovative and truly price-
competitive services. (5)<p>

  <li><b>Fails to move toward complete privatization of the radio spectrum.</b> By missing another 
chance to denationalize the government-owned national resource of radio spectrum, the bill 
fails to open the wireless world to even more vigorous competition. Although making some 
minor modifications in FCC licensing authority and relaxing some ownership restrictions, 
H.R. 1555 makes no effort to create property rights in spectrum ownership or to allow 
holders of spectrum the flexibility to use their spectrum as they choose. Spectrum holders 
now can use their allocation only for purposes defined by the FCC. For example, the holder 
of a television station spectrum license may not convert that station into a cellular telephone 
system even if it would be more efficient and profitable to do so. H.R. 1555 does nothing to 
rectify this inefficient policy.<p>

  <li><b>Makes no serious attempt to minimize bureaucracy.</b> Instead of taking the opportunity to 
eliminate entire branches and bureaus of the FCC, the bill will lead instead to an increase in 
the size and power of the federal bureaucracy overseeing the communications industry. The 
FCC will be responsible for the administration of numerous new transitional rules and 
regulations. This will prevent deregulation from proceeding rapidly, because the agency 
works against market liberalization. (6)<p>

	In addition to these many flaws, the bill fails to remove all rate and price regulation; fails 
to lift unnecessary licensing and tariffing requirements; (7)  fails to allow utilities into 
telecommunications markets they currently are prohibited from entering; fails to define what it 
means to regulate "in the public interest" even though many important decisions hinge on such a 
determination; (8)  and fails to include any mention of the First Amendment.<p>

	The legislative approach being taken by the Senate and House is most appropriately 
labeled "deregulatory industrial policy." Supporters of deregulatory industrial policy are 
convinced they can "create" competition in the telecom industry by rigging the rules of the game 
to achieve desired results. Countless safeguards, transitional rules, and continued protections for 
certain industry segments remain in the bills, supposedly to create a "fair playing field." True 
deregulation, on the other hand, would remove the many unnecessary regulations that constrain 
the industry without adding numerous new rules in the process.<p>

	Although creating a more competitive communications market is a desirable goal, it is 
unlikely the existing regulatory apparatus is up to the task. The FCC and state regulatory 
commissions have done more to destroy competitive opportunities than to create them. And it is 
these institutions that will be charged with creating "competition" under the current Senate and 
House approach. Telecommunications' sister industry --  computers  -- is a good example of how 
competition can develop without centralized direction, regulation, or subsidy. Market power is 
constrained by vigorous technological innovation and consumer choice -- not by arbitrary 
bureaucratic edict. This should be the model for telecommunications.<p>
</ul>



  	



<a name="five"></a><h4>FIVE AMENDMENTS TO MAKE THE BILL TRULY DEREGULATORY</h4>
<p>
[ <a href="#content">Contents </a>]<p>
Despite these weaknesses in the bill, proponents argue correctly that it represents 
an improvement over the status quo. But the House should strengthen the framework 
established in H.R. 1555 by more completely and effectively deregulating the industry. 
Five simple changes would accomplish this.
<p>
<b>Change #1: Mandatory Forbearance and the "Most Favored Regulation" Clause</b>
The addition of a mandatory forbearance clause would relieve competitive carriers 
from all regulation and open the market to unconstrained competition. A competitive 
carrier would be defined as any carrier facing either actual or impending rivalry. In 
markets where competition is less pervasive, such as the residential telephone market, 
regulatory constraints would remain in effect until a pre-determined list of requirements 
like those found in the bill is met. For example, after completing the "checklist" 
requirements, Baby Bell companies would be considered competitive and therefore 
eligible for forbearance from regulation.
<p>
The addition of mandatory forbearance should include a "most favored 
regulation" clause similar to the most favored nation (MFN) treatment accorded by global free trade agreements. Countries that are granted MFN treatment can import their goods on identical terms as other countries. In other words, MFN requires non-discriminatory legal treatment in trade. 
<p>
This same concept can be applied to ensure non-discriminatory regulatory treatment of competing providers and technologies in telecommunications markets. Once a carrier seeks to offer a new service, it can be regulated no more stringently than its least regulated competitor. Such a provision would ensure regulatory parity within 
telecommunications markets as the lines between existing technologies begin to blur.
<p>
<b>Change #2: Mandatory Sunsetting of New Rules After Two to Three Years</b>
A second important change in H.R. 1555 recognizes that while there may be a 
need for transitional rules, they should be phased out as quickly as possible. Although the bill clearly contains too many transitional rules, some will probably remain. For these, the House should include language sunsetting their applicability after a two- or three-year transition period. Any perceived need for their continued existence will have to be dealt with in subsequent legislation or the rules will become invalid.
<p>
<b>Change #3: Devolving Telecommunications Entitlements</b>
This change would create a more sensible method of subsidization by transferring full authority over the definition and delivery of universal service to the states, thereby ensuring a more geographically tailored and state-specific subsidization policy that targeted subsidies more precisely to those who need them most. Because H.R. 1555 could be scored as a tax increase by the Congressional Budget Office, this alternative would address the problems raised by the House approach.
<p>
Again, the "most favored regulation" concept would apply to the provision of 
subsidies to ensure that no company received an unfair advantage over a competitor. By requiring non-discriminatory subsidization, this amendment would discourage states from subsidizing corporations and encourage them to design a means-tested, voucher-like mechanism to deliver assistance directly to individuals instead of through companies.
<p>
<b>Change #4: First Amendment Parity for All Media</b>
All media, whether print or electronic, should be accorded the same First 
Amendment protection under the law. It makes little sense to regulate an on-line service provider of news differently than a daily newspaper. As such technologies converge, it will become difficult, if not impossible, to regulate them under different standards. H.R. 1555 makes no mention of the First Amendment or of how electronic technologies should be regulated. Congress should recognize the importance of placing all technologies on equal regulatory footing by mandating they be granted the same First Amendment protections. (9) 
<p>
<b>Change #5: Creating a Free Market for Spectrum</b>
Beyond the incremental reforms found in H.R. 1555, lawmakers should free the 
electromagnetic radio spectrum from its seven-decade-old regulatory constraints. All 
incumbent holders of spectrum should be granted irrevocable, perpetual property rights in their wireless holdings. Like all other property, spectrum could be used as the owner sees fit, subject to common law standards of trespass and interference. More important, the FCC would be directed to auction off immediately all competing claims for unused spectrum. Finally, to encourage the government to disgorge as much of its current spectrum as possible, federal agencies would be provided with a certain percentage of any <p> revenues raised from the sale of their spectrum. This would encourage government spectrum users to place some of their vast spectrum holdings on the auctioning block to be purchased for more efficient uses. This plan, originally laid out in a recent report by the <a href="http://www.pff.org">Progress and Freedom Foundation</a>,  would guarantee more efficient deployment and use of wireless communications technologies. 
<p>
<a name="conclusion"></a><b>Conclusion</b><p>
[ <a href="#content">Contents</a> ]<p>
Many supporters of H.R. 1555 argue that adding more radical pro-deregulatory 
language to the bill decreases the likelihood of final passage. However, it is unlikely that a more principled bill would face any more serious opposition than the current bill. 
<p>
Proponents of the current telecommunications bill also point out that it represents 
the first of many efforts at comprehensive deregulation of the telecommunications 
industry and that additional improvements can be made in subsequent legislation. This is unlikely. On June 19, the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee held a single two-hour hearing to discuss the future of the FCC. No budget cuts were recommended and no substantial changes in the FCC's current structure were proposed -- despite earlier public calls by leaders of that committee for a radical downsizing of the agency.
<p>
Although spectrum policy could be dealt with in a separate bill, it is unclear why 
it should be broken out of the current legislation since a competitive wireless sector is 
essential to a more competitive wireline sector. If Congress waits months or even years to deregulate the wireless sector properly, a truly uneven playing field could result, further wireless technological innovation could be repressed, and local telephone competition could be delayed.
<p>
 The House must help the Senate fundamentally reform U.S. telecommunications 
policy. It can do this by removing -- immediately and unconditionally -- all barriers to 
entry, scrapping any overly regulatory language remaining in the bill, effectively 
reforming the universal service subsidy mechanisms as well as wireless spectrum policy, and  guaranteeing that First Amendment protections are enforced equally across all media.
<p>
If the House misses this final opportunity to remove the bill's excess regulatory 
baggage and strengthen its market-oriented elements, it is unlikely that Congress will 
produce a truly deregulatory bill this year.

<P>
In response to mounting problems, the White House has adopted
a new strategy to promote the nomination of Dr. Henry Foster as
Surgeon General.  It has chosen to frame the debate as a referendum
on the legality of abortion and to label its opponents as right-to-life
&quot;extremists.&quot; 
<P>
The White House's attempt to evoke a knee-jerk reaction from the
American public fails to address the salient issues of the debate,
however.  The Foster nomination is <U>not</U> about the legality
of abortion, and those calling for Foster's withdrawal are not
&quot;extreme.&quot;
<P>
The dictionary defines &quot;extremism&quot; as deviating to the
greatest degree from the center of opinion.  So what is the center
of opinion?  On the issue of abortion, the White House implicitly
argues that Henry Foster represents the center of public opinion.
 However, public opinion polls compiled by the American Enterprise
Institute show that Henry Foster occupies one end of the abortion
spectrum and that the majority of Americans do <U>not</U> subscribe
to Dr. Foster's views.
<UL>
<LI> A 1994 Gallup poll commissioned by CNN and <I>USA Today</I>
found that 65 percent of Americans believe that abortions should
either be &quot;illegal in all circumstances&quot; or &quot;legal
under certain circumstances.&quot;  Only 33 percent would agree
with Dr. Foster that abortions should be &quot;legal under any
circumstances.&quot;
<P>
<LI> A 1995 CBS News/<I>New York Times</I> poll (1/95) found that
60 percent believe that abortion should either &quot;not be permitted&quot;
or have &quot;stricter limits.&quot;  Dr. Foster's views that
abortion should be &quot;generally available&quot; are shared
by only 38 percent of the population.
<P>
<LI>A 1994 Roper study commissioned by Focus on the Family and the
Family Research Council polled abortion views on a 9-point continuum.
 From category 1 representing the most pro-life stance to category
9 representing the most pro-abortion stance, Dr. Foster's views
place him in either category 8 or 9.  Only 13 percent of Americans
fall into those two categories combined.
</UL>
<P>
Dr. Foster's record shows that he vigorously opposes popular measures
such as waiting periods and parental consent and notification
laws.  Foster also believes that abortions should be available
through all nine months of pregnancy, even 
after the fetus is viable outside of the mother's womb.  Can Dr.
Foster, as an 
individual who not only holds these views, but has also personally
performed abortions, conducted studies on mothers and their unborn
children to test abortion drugs, and performed sterilizations
on mentally retarded young women without their consent, be accurately
described as holding to the center of this public opinion?
<P>
And then there's the issue of Dr. Foster's credibility.  Dr. Foster
and the White House have not been forthright in representing Foster's
abortion record.  First, the White House said nothing about abortion.
 Then it admitted to Sen. Nancy Kassebaum that Foster had performed
<B>one</B> abortion.  Then Dr. Foster issued a statement saying
that he had done &quot;<B>fewer than a dozen</B>.&quot;  Then
there was the 1978 Department of Health, Education, and Welfare
transcript that recorded Foster as saying he had done &quot;<B>probably
near 700</B>&quot; amniocentesis tests and therapeutic abortions.
 Then Dr. Foster admitted his involvement in <B>55</B> abortions
when conducting abortion drug trials in 1981.  Then Foster told
<I>Nightline</I> that he was the &quot;physician of record&quot;
for <B>39</B> abortions.
<P>
The issue of credibility is hardly a minor point, especially for
an individual in whom Americans are asked to repose their trust.
 Are Foster's critics &quot;extreme&quot; for wanting a Surgeon
General who is truthful and forthright?
<P>
Lastly, the White House has characterized Foster's critics as
&quot;right to life extremists.&quot;  As of this writing, those
calling for the withdrawal of the Foster nomination include pro-life
groups, pro-family groups, the New York chapter of the National
Organization for Women, the <I>New York Times</I>, the <I>Washington
Post</I>, the <I>Washington Times</I>, the National Coalition
of Abortion Providers, Senators Joseph Biden, Nancy Kassebaum,
Bob Dole, and Dan Coats, among others.  Are all of these &quot;right
to life extremists&quot;?  If so, then where does that put the
White House and Henry Foster?  If not, then why has the White
House singled out the pro-life community for its rhetorical venom?
<P>
Groups coming from many different perspectives oppose the Foster
nomination for many different reasons.  Yet the White House has
chosen to label anyone who doesn't agree with its position as
&quot;extreme&quot;?  Did I miss something, or does the White
House now hold a monopoly on what can be considered &quot;mainstream&quot;?

Abortion advocates have seized upon the results of the latest
public opinion poll on abortion, proclaiming that the overwhelming
majority of Americans (75 percent) are &quot;pro-choice&quot;
while only a small group (23 percent) are &quot;anti-abortion.&quot;
 The White House has used these purported findings to justify
its promotion of Dr. Henry Foster for Surgeon General.  And &quot;pro-choice&quot;
legislators have cited these &quot;findings&quot; as evidence
that the Republican Party should abandon its historic pro-life
commitment.
<P>
But a closer examination of this and other public opinion polls
reveals that such an interpretation is, in fact, misleading. 

<P>
The CBS News/<I>New York Times</I> poll to which abortion advocates
are referring found that 23 percent of respondents believe that
&quot;abortion should not be permitted;&quot; 37 percent believe
that &quot;abortion should be available but under stricter limits
than it is now;&quot; and 38 percent believe that &quot;abortion
should be generally available to those who want it.&quot;  These
results do not show 75 percent being in favor of the pro-abortion
activism of Dr. Henry Foster.  Nor does the survey show a mandate
for the GOP to disenfranchise its constituency who are morally
concerned about abortion, as abortion advocates would argue. 
Rather, the survey shows that 60 percent of Americans believe
that abortion should either be banned or more strictly limited.
<P>
Similar results have been obtained from other public opinion polls.
 A September 1994 Gallup poll for CNN and <I>USA Today</I> found
that 65 percent of Americans believe that abortions should either
be &quot;illegal in all circumstances&quot; (13 percent) or &quot;legal
under certain circumstances&quot; (52 percent).  Only 33 percent
believe that abortions should be &quot;legal under any circumstances.&quot;
<P>
Interestingly, when the &quot;legal under certain circumstances&quot;
category is defined more narrowly, a majority of respondents still
offer a &quot;pro-life&quot; response.  A September 1994 <I>Time</I>/CNN
poll found that 52 percent of respondents believe that &quot;abortion
should be illegal in all circumstances&quot; (13 percent) or that
&quot;abortion should only be legal in certain circumstances such
as when a woman's health is endangered or when the pregnancy results
from rape or incest&quot; (39 percent).
<P>
These findings reveal that large numbers of Americans express
moral objections to or reservations about abortion.  Indeed, when
a 1995 CBS News/<I>New York </I>
<I>Times</I> poll asked respondents to choose which one of two
statements more closely resembled their viewpoint on abortion,
46 percent responded that &quot;abortion is the same thing as
murdering a child&quot; as opposed to 41 percent who agreed that
&quot;abortion is not murder because the fetus really isn't a
child.&quot;
<P>
A 1993 Family Research Council poll conducted by the Voter/Consumer
Research group asked respondents whether they &quot;strongly agree,&quot;
&quot;somewhat agree,&quot; &quot;somewhat disagree,&quot; or
&quot;strongly disagree&quot; with the following statements about
abortion:  &quot;Unborn children should have the right to life&quot;
and &quot;Women should have the right to choose to have an abortion.&quot;
 Not surprisingly, the phrasing of the questions influenced some
respondents' answers -- towards the unborn child's right to life
in the first case and towards the woman's &quot;right to choose&quot;
in the second.  However, when the results were cross-tabulated
to discover those who would &quot;strongly agree&quot; with one
question and &quot;strongly disagree&quot; with the other, 25.6
percent held strongly pro-life views; 20.4 percent were strongly
pro-choice.  The rest were somewhat torn or confused.
<P>
Syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer identifies with this
torn or confused group.  While he does not support efforts to
make abortion illegal, he opposes the Foster nomination because
he is troubled by the prospect of having a Surgeon General who
has personally performed abortions, who has tested abortion drugs
on mothers and their unborn children, who opposes waiting periods
and parental consent/notification laws, and who believes in abortion
through all nine months of pregnancy, even after the fetus is
viable outside of the mother's womb.  Krauthammer believes many
other &quot;pro-choice&quot; Americans share his objections to
abortion and to the Foster nomination.  He believes the White
House's nomination of Dr. Foster shows an insensitivity to the
fact that most Americans do believe abortion is immoral.
<P>
The GOP would be wise not to abandon the high moral ground in
the abortion debate.  While the issue is certainly not settled,
a majority of Americans do morally disapprove of abortion -- and
this broad moral unease means that pro-life policymakers need
not shrink from the battle.  Indeed, the Foster nomination is
but one example of how the abortion issue cuts for pro-lifers.

<title>BAN PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTIONS</title>
<body>

<h2>BAN PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTIONS</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<p>
It isn't often that congressmen and senators have the opportunity
to vote on something as important as preserving human life.  But
those in the House of Representatives will have such an opportunity
during the first week in November, and those in the Senate may
have the opportunity shortly thereafter.
<p>
Rep. Charles Canady (R-Fla.) has introduced H.R. 1833, which would
ban partial-birth abortions.  The companion bill, S. 939, has
been introduced by Sen. Bob Smith (R-N.H.).  This important bill
should gain support from people across the political spectrum
because the bill helps to protect innocent human life from being
exterminated outside the womb.  Moreover, because the bill focuses
on the partial-birth abortion procedure, it educates both the
Congress and the public about the reality of the abortion act.
<p>
Rep. Canady's bill already has more than 150 cosponsors on both
sides of the aisle.  (The Senate bill has six.)  The House Judiciary
Committee passed H.R. 1833 overwhelmingly in July, and even the
12-member American Medical Association's legislative council voted
<I>unanimously</I> to <I>endorse</I> the Partial-Birth Abortion
Ban Act.  When asked about the council's decision, one legislative
council representative called the procedure &quot;basically repulsive,&quot;
saying that it wasn't a &quot;recognized medical technique.&quot;
<p>
...And it isn't, or at least it shouldn't be.
<p>
First of all, partial-birth abortions involve aborting partially-delivered
babies from four and a half months into the pregnancy up to even
the <I>ninth month</I>.  The procedure consists of  partially
delivering the live baby feet first so that all but the head is
outside the mother's womb.  The head remains in the uterus while
the abortionist kills the baby by stabbing surgical scissors into
the base of its head, then suctioning out the brain by a small
tube, and then completing the delivery of the now-dead baby. 
The legislation makes it a crime to perform this procedure except
to save the mother's life.  A woman undergoing the abortion would
not be penalized and could not sue the abortionist, but the abortionist
could be punished  for up to two years in prison and/or fined.
<p>
Ohio Registered Nurse Brenda Pratt Shafer, who has assisted in
three partial-birth abortions, describes the process this way:
<p>
&quot;Dr. Haskell brought the ultrasound in and hooked it up so
that he could see the baby. On the ultrasound screen, I could see the heart 
beating. I asked Dr. Haskell, and he told me that, 'Yes, that is the heartbeat.'
 As Dr. Haskell watched the baby on the ultrasound screen, he
went in with forceps and grabbed the baby's legs and brought them
down into the birth canal.  Then he delivered the body and the
arms, all the way up to the neck.  At this point, only the baby's
head was still inside.  The baby's body was moving.  His little
fingers were clasping together.  He was kicking his feet.  All
the while his little head was still stuck inside.  Dr. Haskell
took a pair of scissors and inserted them into the back of the
baby's head.  Then he opened the scissors up.  Then he stuck the
high-powered suction tube into the hole and sucked the baby's
brains out.  I almost threw up as I watched him do these things....&quot;
<p>
&quot;I never realized how perfect these babies really are at
this point.  When you hear the word 'fetus,' I think a lot of
people think, as I did, of just a blob of cells, or a mass or
something.  It was very revealing to me.  I don't think about
abortion the same way anymore.&quot;
<p>
According to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, the research arm of
Planned Parenthood, approximately 13,000 abortions every year
occur after the 20th week of pregnancy (four and a half months).
 While it is not known how many of these are partial-birth abortions,
two abortionists, including Dr. Haskell, have said publicly in
different interviews that they have performed 3,000 &quot;late
term&quot; abortions, including the partial-birth procedure, between
the two of them.  Rep. Canady's bill is a first step to preventing
the horror of late-term abortions.
<p>
Public opinion polls show that an overwhelming majority reject
late-term abortions.  Yet, the Supreme Court has never dealt with
the issue of a &quot;partially-born&quot; child.  The Partial-Birth
Abortion Ban Act will rightly outlaw the most barbaric of the
late-term abortion procedures.
<p>
Proponents of abortion will argue that all abortions are needed
in cases of &quot;health of the mother.&quot;  This reasoning
is flawed because typically, courts have defined &quot;health
of the mother&quot; clauses very broadly to encompass &quot;all
factors -- physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the
woman's age -- relevant to the well-being of the patient.&quot;
(<I>Doe v. Bolton</I>, 410 U.S.C. at 192 (1973), emphasis added.)
In fact, of the many reasons why a mother would elect to abort
her unborn child (i.e., parental disapproval, physical inconvenience,
emotional distress), none would fall outside the realm of this
&quot;exception.&quot;
<p>
Similarly, the case is often made for abortions that are &quot;medically
necessary.&quot;  However, this is equivalent to abortion on demand.
William Hamilton, vice president of the Planned Parenthood Federation
of America, told Knight-Ridder Newspapers that &quot;medically
necessary&quot; means &quot;anything a doctor and a woman construe
to be in her best interest, whether prenatal care or abortion.&quot;
Judith Feder, a Clinton Administration health official, stated
that &quot;the decision of the woman and the physician&quot; determines
whether a service can be considered &quot;medically necessary.&quot;
<p>
This modest legislation provides a means for a civil society to
register its objections by banning this unwarranted act of violence
against a helpless member of our human family.

<title>MANY COUPLES STILL WAITING TO ADOPT CHILDREN</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">

<p>
<h2>MANY COUPLES STILL WAITING<br>
TO ADOPT CHILDREN</h2></center>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>

The National Council for Adoption (NCFA) conservatively estimates
that there are at least one million infertile and fertile couples
who are waiting to adopt children.[1] For every one adoptable infant
available, there are at least 40 couples hoping to adopt.[2] Today,
it is not unusual to pick up a local newspaper and find an advertisement
placed by a married couple searching for a child to adopt.
<p>
What is causing this high &quot;adoption demand&quot;? While the
answer is no doubt multi-faceted and complex, the following factors
have contributed to this phenomenon:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Plummeting adoption rates among unwed mothers --</b> Despite
the four-fold increase in the number of births to unmarried women
since 1967, the number of these unwed mothers choosing to place
their children for adoption declined by one-third during that
same time period.[3] Thus, while about one in five premarital births
to white women was placed for adoption in the late 1960s, by 1988,
this proportion had shrunk to one in 30.[4]
<p>
<li><b>Abortion</b> -- Approximately 1.5 million abortions take
place in the United States every year. About one-quarter of these
abortions are to teenagers, and more than four-fifths are to unmarried
mothers.[5] Each of these aborted pregnancies represents a potential
adoption; and if adoption rather than abortion were chosen in
these instances, the high adoption demand could be greatly alleviated.
<p>
<li><b>Infertility</b> -- The demand for adoptable babies remains
high due to continued infertility. Two sources of infertility
are examined below:
<p>
<b>Sexually-Transmitted Diseases (STDs)</b> -- The Alan Guttmacher
Institute estimates that between 100,000 and 150,000 women become
infertile each year as a result of an STD that has resulted in
pelvic inflammatory disease. Thus, of the 2.3 million U.S. couples
who are infertile, 15 to 30 percent are infertile or unable to
conceive as a result of an STD.[6] Furthermore, while the rate of
infertility remained about the same from 1967 to 1982 at 2.4 million
couples (or one couple in every seven), infertility among couples
aged 20-24 increased from 4 percent in 1965 to 11 percent in 1982.[7]
It is likely that a good portion of this increase in early-age
infertility is directly attributable to sexually-transmitted diseases.
<p>
<b>Delayed Marriage and/or Childbearing</b> -- Data shows that
more people are delaying marriage and postponing childbearing
until older ages. For example, the proportion of first-time brides
who were between 25 and 39 years of age rose from 11 percent in
1970 to 41 percent in 1990.[8] In addition, the percentage of women
reaching age 35 who were still childless increased from 15 percent
in 1980 to 21 percent in 1991.[9] These statistics are significant
because age is positively associated with elevated risks of infertility
and miscarriage.[10]
<p></ul>
Because prospective adoptive couples greatly outnumber available
adoptable children, there exist long waiting lists for children,
regardless of age, race, or &quot;special needs.&quot; Consider
the following:
<ul><p>
<li>Of the 51,157 American children who were adopted in 1986 (the
latest available published data on domestic adoptions by the NCFA),
approximately one-half (24,589) were adoptions of healthy infants
(under 2 years of age) of all races and ethnic backgrounds. The
remainder were adoptions of older children or children with &quot;special
needs&quot; (physical, mental or emotional disabilities, being
part of a sibling group, etc.).[11]
<p>
<li>Babies, regardless of medical problems, are in particularly
high demand. There are waiting lists of couples who would like
to adopt infants with Downs Syndrome or spina bifida. The National
Downs Syndrome Adoption Exchange reports they have more than 100
approved families waiting to adopt children with Downs Syndrome.
There are also a large number of couples who would like to adopt
terminally-ill babies, including babies with AIDS.[12]
<p>
<li>In addition to the 50,000 domestic adoptions each year, American
couples or individuals adopt several thousand foreign-born children.
Begun first as a solution to emergency situations in foreign countries,
these adoptions have now become an important adoption alternative.
</ul><p>
<center><h4>Number of foreign adoptions by year, 1973-1994:[13]</h4>

4,323  5,446  6,290   7,051  6,854  5,652  4,864  5,139  4,868  5,749  7,127

</pre></center>
<p>
The numbers of foreign adoptions per year does not follow a recognizable
trend because intercountry adoptions are driven by supply. For
example, the Korean government has been on the front lines in
facilitating adoption. As a result, thousands of Korean children
were adopted by American citizens, accounting for the swell in
intercountry adoptions during the mid-1980s.[14] But even when foreign
governments fail to facilitate adoption, the demand for children
remains high. For example, after it aired a story on abandoned
Romanian infants, ABC-TV's &quot;20/20&quot; reported that it
received over 25,000 self-addressed stamped envelopes from individuals
wanting to adopt Romanian orphans.[15]
<p>
The &quot;adoption demand,&quot; though a large problem, could
<I>theoretically</I> be erased or at least drastically reduced
if more pregnant women chose to adoption rather than abortion
or if more unwed mothers chose adoption rather than single parenting.
However, until the adoption option is chosen by more of these
mothers in <I>reality</I>, many of these couples' desires to adopt
children will remain unfulfilled.

<p>
After presidential candidate Bill Clinton vowed to make abortion "safe, legal, and rare," President Clinton and his administration devised a somewhat bizarre strategy to help accomplish that goal. Within days of assuming office, the president signed four executive orders addressing abortion: He lifted the ban on fetal tissue research; he ended the ban on abortion counseling in federally funded clinics; he began a process to approve the abortion pill RU 486; and he revoked the prohibition against abortions in military hospitals overseas. All these policies would seem to increase the accessibility and likelihood of abortion.<p>
Even so, it is remarkable that abortion does seem to be slightly rarer. The total number of abortions in America dropped by 80,000 in 1992, hitting its lowest level since 1979. Abortion rates, declining for more than a decade, dropped again, to under 26 per 1,000 women of child-bearing age. There was a decrease as well in the percentage of pregnancies ending in abortion, from a high of about 30 percent in 1983-85 to less than 27.5 percent in 1992. For the first time since Roe v. Wadethe Supreme Court ruling that repealed every state law restricting abortionwe have seen significant declines in all three categories for measuring abortion in America. And, though statistics aren't yet available, abortion providers expect to see lower numbers for 1993 and 1994.<p>
Why? <p>
The evidence for a decline in abortion is, admittedly, incomplete. Many states don't collect the sort of data required to draw solid conclusionssuch as precise, annual figures for abortions, teen pregnancies, and illegitimate births. And whatever the decline in abortion, the descent has not been terribly steep. From 1980 to 1990, the annual figure wobbled between 1.55 million and 1.61 million. Though abortions performed in 1992 dropped to 1.53 million, the figure represents only a 5 percent decline from its 1990 peak.<p>
There seem to be at least four reasons for this slight decline. Over the last several years, we have witnessed a social movement to encourage teenagers to postpone sexual relations until marriage, increased professionalism and sensitivity in the nation's pro-life pregnancy care centers, growth in state laws fostering a fully informed abortion decision, and a decline in the number of doctors who perform abortions.<p><center><b>Learning to Wait</b></center><p>
Until recently, the prevailing approach for reducing the level of abortion has been to encourage contraceptive use, while reserving abortion as a fall-back solution. The assumption of this approach is that it is impossible to reduce sexual activity among teens or adults outside of marriage. Advocates of this position hope there are fewer abortion clients because women are making more efficient use of contraceptives. According to Susan Tew of the Alan Guttmacher Institute, the proportion of unplanned pregnancies actually increased in the 1980s, from 54 percent in 1982 to 56 percent in 1988, the latest year for which figures are available. Tew says that women who are "young, poor, unwed, and minority" are more likely to have abortions, less likely to find access to contraceptives, and to understand the relative risks and benefits of various methods. More recent survey data indicates that the use of oral contraceptives and condoms is increasing; the latter may be due to heightened awareness of the dangers of sexually transmitted diseases.<p>
However, part of the recent drop in abortions could be attributed more to a decline in teenage sexual activity than a rise in contraceptive use. Studies by the Centers for Disease Control have shown the proportion of sexually experienced highschoolers dropping: In 1989, 59 percent engaged in intercourse, in 1991 the figure was 54 percent, and in 1992 it dropped to 43 percent. A 1994 Roper Starch survey, conducted in association with the Sex Information and Education Council of the United States, found that only 36 percent of high schoolers said they had had sex. In the latter survey, many of those who had "done it" wished they hadn't: 62 percent of sexually experienced girls, and 54 percent of all experienced high schoolers, said they "should have waited." <p>
Confirmation of these sentiments is found in an Emory University survey that asked 1,000 sexually active young teen girls what topic they wanted more information about. Nearly 85 percent checked "How to say no without hurting the other person's feelings." The meaning of politeness has shifted in one generation from "nice girls don't" to "nice girls have to."<p>
Abstinence-education programs across the country have found that telling kids not to have sex is surprisingly successful. A Title XX performance evaluation found that, two years after the Sex Respect program, non-participants were twice as likely as participants to have gotten pregnant. When the Teen Aid program moved into a California junior-high school, 147 students were reported pregnant; two years later, only 20 girls were pregnant. At a Chicago middle school, each eighth-grade graduating class usually included some pregnant girls; but three years of Project Taking Charge yielded three classes with no pregnant graduates.<p>
One of the most unusual success stories is that of True Love Waits, a program begun by a Baptist youth pastor in Tennessee. It offers adolescents a chance to sign "pledge cards" vowing virginity until marriage. What sounds to hip and aging baby boomers like boring prudery was seized by teenagers with an eagerness their parents had reserved for hula hoops. In one year, 500,000 cards were signed, and the program has spread across 26 denominations, Catholic and Protestant. Last July, 20,000 kids staked 200,000 of the cards on the Washington Mall, and spent the day dancing and picknicking. President Clinton came by for a few minutes to join them.<p><center><b>Rising Moral Concerns</center></b>
<p>
A rise in youthful morality about sex outside marriage is paralleled by moral concerns about abortion. A recent CBS/New York Times poll found that, while 46 percent of respondents said that abortion is murder, the age group most likely to voice that opinion was 18 to 29. In 1990, a series of focus groups was conducted by researchers for the Center for Population Options, exploring teens' attitudes toward abortion. To the authors' evident dismay, "In response to the question, 'What first comes into your head when you hear the word "abortion"?' participantsregardless of race, sex, or residencemost often responded with 'murder,' 'killing a baby' or 'death.'In general, the female participants were especially judgmental of other women's motivesin some cases not even sanctioning abortion in the case of rape. Comments focused on the 'innocence' of the baby, regardless of the circumstances."<p>
The growing concern about the "innocence" of the baby has not yet led to a change in attitudes about the legality of abortion. For example, a periodic NBC/Wall Street Journal poll asks, "Do you think abortion should be illegal, or not?" In eight surveys between 1989 and 1993, those responding "illegal" wavered from 33 percent to 26 percent and back up to 35 percent, a wobbly but fairly consistent response. Nor does a conviction that abortion is wrong necessarily insure that the respondent would refuse to have one. While researching for my book, Real Choices, I interviewed women across the country who had had abortions, and found several who had been pro-life, committed Christians at the time. They fully believed that in choosing abortion they were killing their babies. A common coping mechanism was, "God, I'll send this baby back to you now, and when I'm ready you send it back to me." Anti-abortion opinions did not prevent them from having abortions when their situations felt overwhelmingly difficult.<p>
The goal of my research project was to discover why women had abortions, in hopes that we could reduce the numbers by solving pregnancy problems. Like the Guttmacher Institute and other researchers' studies, I found that women usually have several interconnecting reasons for their abortions, involving job, school, finances, present concerns, and fears for the future. However, when I asked women to recount the story of their abortion decision, one factor emerged as determinative nearly every time: problems in personal relationships. Almost 90 percent of the women surveyed said the main reason for the abortion was to please or protect some other person, usually a partner or parents. When asked, "What would you have needed to continue the pregnancy?" the answer was consistent and emphatic: "Just one person. If I'd had only one person to stand by me, I would have had my baby."<p><b><center>Compassion and Persuasion</b></center><p>
The pregnancy-care wing of the pro-life movement has been trying to provide that personal support and friendship for 30 years, with increasing professionalism and success. This care usually shows up in the form of pregnancy-care centers, humble storefront operations scattered across the land, where material and emotional support is given to women free. These centers are usually run on a shoestringmany have no paid staffand they can only give what others donate, from maternity clothes and diapers to housing, job training, medical care, and advice on adoption and parenting. <p>
In these pages a few years ago ("Victorian Secret," Spring 1992), Marvin Olasky suggested that aid to pregnant women was more effective than legal prohibitions in reducing abortion rates in the 19th century. Are advances in the provision of pregnancy support an element in the reduced number of abortions? "There just isn't enough information there to say, one way or the other," Olasky says. "But certainly the pregnancy-care movement has been tremendously effective in keeping the numbers as low as they are. Without pro-lifers offering support and shelter to pregnant women over the years, the abortion toll would have been far higher."<p>
Some pregnancy-care centers are independent operations, while others affiliate with national chains. The two largest chains are Birthright and Care Net, which together represent about 1,000 centers. In these chains and elsewhere, the last few years have seen a shift toward a philosophy sometimes summarized in the slogan, "Love them both." Pam Stearns, director of the Hope Unlimited Pregnancy Care Center in Paducah, Kentucky, says, "Before, we had pictures of aborted fetuses right in the lobbywe had an aggressive agenda of saving the baby. Now the focus has been enlarged, and our mission is to serve the client. Everything is done to make her feel comfortable, not used and manipulated." Today, a visitor to the Paducah center will see landscapes and flowers in the lobby, and be greeted by a volunteer who listens carefully to her needs and fears.<p>
A unexpected phenomenon that may be implicated in the drop in abortion rates is being observed at these pregnancy-care centers: an increased demand for grief counseling, for men as well as women. Several pregnancy center directors say that this is becoming their fastest-expanding area of service. Staff at a center in South Carolina report, for example, that while they usually start one grief group per month, in January they had to start three, plus their first men's group. <p>
For many years, abortion mourning had no outlet; as one Real Choices interviewee, Bette, put it, pro-choice friends needed her to continue affirming her decision, and she feared revealing to pro-lifers that "I did what you despise." Now, as women find the freedom to tell their friends about their heartbreak, it may become a form of negative word-of-mouth advertising that could cause others to avoid abortion. In theory, both pro-life and pro-choice forces have an interest in helping women make the best resolution they can, but Bette goes on, "I was surprised at the way [pro-life] people accepted me. They were able to recognize and validate my pain. The pro-choice side can't do thatthey have too much need to pretend that it isn't there."<p><center><b>Legislating for Life</b></center><p>
State laws to encourage informed decisions about abortion have multiplied in recent years and seem to have achieved some results. Nineteen states require that clinics provide information on the development of the baby, as well as the risks of and alternatives to abortion; 11 require women to wait 24 hours for "reflection"; 24 states require a parent to be involved before a teen's abortion.<p>
It should be noted that none of these laws actually places restrictions on abortion. No one is prevented from having the procedure. The Supreme Court's stipulation in the Casey decision of 1992 was that such laws were valid only if abortion was still permitted in all situations, with no "undue burden" placed on the freedom to abort. If women are declining abortion because more information and time to think have increased their awareness of alternatives, that is an expansion of choice, not a restriction. No one's business has been inhibited. Big-city yellow pages still run display ads by providers offering to end pregnancies up through the 24th week, with specialists available around the country to perform them later on request.<p>
In 1991, the American Journal of Public Health published an article examining the effect of a parental-notification law in Minnesota. During the four years the law was in effect, the abortion rate for minors fell dramatically27 percentwhile the birth rate continued to fall in accord with a long-term trend. Overall, teen pregnancy was down 21 percent. The hopeful conclusion is that the law did not merely stop abortions, but caused teens to be more careful about preventing pregnancy. According to the report, "Positive claims about these laws are that they promote responsibility (by encouraging teenagers to 'think before they act'), foster parent-child communication, facilitate mature decision making, and may reveal medical history information that would otherwise remain unknown to the physician."<p><b><center>Market Realities</b></center><p>
Another explanation for the decline in abortions is that fewer doctors will perform the procedure. Between 1985 and 1988, there were an average of 33 fewer abortion providers every year; by the 1988 to 1992 period, the yearly loss had accelerated to 51. Part of this loss is due to the "graying of abortion providers," as the average age of a provider slips above the average age of physicians, and retirement claims an increasing proportion. Some doctors leave the field because of harassment or fear of violence; the increased cost of security is one reason the average price of an abortion rose from $250 in 1988 to $300 in 1992.<p>
Why aren't younger doctors entering the field?<p>
To an idealistic young doctor, abortion has little appealit's fundamentally a destructive operation, offering little professional challenge, and no ongoing doctor-patient relationship. In addition, other doctors hold abortion providers in low esteem. Warren Hern, an abortion specialist in Boulder, Colorado, complains that his fellow providers "are treated as a pariah by the medical community. At best, we are tolerated." In 1993, the controversial Project Choice survey (staged by pro-life activists under a sympathetic-sounding name) polled almost a thousand abortion providers; 69 percent said their profession was "not respected in the medical community" and 78 percent said that they did not feel "pro-choice organizations and politicians are doing enough to support those who provide abortion care." <p>
A better question is, in the face of these discouragements, why did older doctors join the field? Thirty years ago, doctors were still seeing women come into emergency rooms injured by self-abortion or illegal abortion, and it was possible to see the provision of legal abortion as a noble, lifesaving act. Seventy-one percent of the Project Choice respondents had "personally [seen] a tragedy as a result of an illegal abortion," another subtle indication of their age. Younger doctors have not had that galvanizing experience. On the other hand, they have had experience with more recent medical advances: sonograms and fetoscopy, fetal surgery, and the rescuing of ever-younger preemies. All of these make indelibly visible what abortionlegal or illegaldestroys. Likewise, it was easier to feel positive about delivering abortions when only a few desperate cases were envisioned; the routine toll of 1.5 million a year sours everybody. <p>
Abortion provision is a specialty that is not intrinsically rewarding, is held in low esteem by the public and medical colleagues alike, and exposes one to the risk of hatred or even violence from protesters. When an aspiring doctor thinks, "What do I want to be?" a great many other options will come to mind before this. <p>
The dwindling ranks of abortion providers seem to be helping to bring down the abortion rates in some states. Nationally, there are about four providers per 100,000 women of reproductive age. In Hawaii, where the relative number of providers is 19.6, the abortion rate is the second highest in the country. In states such as Kentucky and Missouri, with fewer than 1.5 providers, the abortion rate hovers between one fourth and one half the national average.<p>
If there are fewer abortion providers available, would women, in large numbers, resort to self-inflicted abortions? Or would they simply cross state lines to have abortions elsewhere? The answers are no and perhaps. Though the number of providers has already dropped, there is simply no evidence that illegal abortion has returned. It may be that illegal abortion has been so thoroughly discredited that no woman wants to risk it.<p>
Some travel would undoubtedly occur: In 1987, more Wyoming women had abortions out-of-state than in-state. (In Cheyenne, the state's largest city, no abortions were performed in 1992.) On the other hand, abortion rates tend to be higher for poor non-white or Hispanic women, who are less likely to have the resources to travel. Then again, they are more likely to live in metropolitan areas where providers already cluster (94 percent of non-metropolitan areas now have no provider). Making state-by-state predictions is maddeningly uncertain, however. Between 1988 and 1992, North Dakota went from three providers to one, and the abortion rate dropped 28 percent. South Dakota remained steady with only one provider, and the rate rose 19 percent.<p><b><center>The Age Factor</b></center><p>
A final consideration of the drop in abortions involves age: As the baby boomers get older, the cohort of women of reproductive age (15 to 44) is weighted more heavily toward the end, where fewer pregnancies occur. Since two thirds of all abortions are performed on women under 25, the abortion rate should drop when the size of that group shrinks. The decline in the ranks of females age 15 to 22 from 1988 to 1992 could account for one-sixth of the decline in abortions over this period.<p>
Among the uncertainties regarding the abortion decline, one unhappy certainty looms: A great many more women are choosing single parenting. In 1981, births to unwed mothers occurred at the rate of 30 per 1,000 women of childbearing age, rising to 39 by 1988 and 45 by 1991. Pregnancy-care centers report that most of their unwed clients who choose birth opt for single parenting, while only a tiny number choose adoption. Amid a growing social consensus that unwed parenting damages both mother and child, these statistics are discouraging. Prochoice advocates may think that abortion would have been a better choice; pro-lifers would rather see these children born than aborted, but would prefer their moms either marry or place the child for adoption. Both sides agree that prevention is better than cure.<p>
The drop in abortion numbers in 1992 is a tantalizingly cryptic event. Analyzing it is like trying to follow the action of a play with the curtain risen only far enough to show the actors' ankles. No one on any side in this debate, much less the confused folks in the middle, can predict what will happen next. But a scrap of information like this does tantalize, because the abortion issue reverberates with meanings beyond itself. Abortion asks us big questions about "Life, the Universe, and Everything." It asks ultimate questions like, "Who belongs in our human family?" "Who may kill?" and "When does life begin?"<p>
For the last question, at least, there is an answer. It is 23. Life begins at 23 pairs of chromosomesor, for those with Down's syndrome, 23 pairs plus one. Unless that number were somehow repealed, it matters little whether the other numbers are a million-point-five or a million-point-six. It's still more than 4,000 every day, more than 31 million since Roe v. Wade; it's still a number that prods our weary consciences, a little more sternly every day.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
	Soaring rates of illegitimacy are threatening America's social fabric. But Members of Congress and state officials, as they wrestle with the problems of reforming America's welfare system, can design a functional public policy to combat adolescent pregnancy and illegitimate births. This policy should be based on personal responsibility, including sexual abstinence.
<p>
	For the last quarter century, government has pursued a pragmatic "contraceptive approach" to adolescent pregnancy. This approach has been a costly failure because it generally ignores basic realities of culture and developmental psychology. The "abstinence approach," on the other hand, successfully incorporates the basic cultural and psychological realities of the transition to adulthood. By inculcating individual "resistance skills," abstinence becomes more firmly established the more widely it is applied, which in turn has a beneficial effect on social norms.
<p>
	In a healthy society, individuals are motivated by hope for the future rather than instant gratification, and rely on social skills rather than technology to overcome interpersonal problems. These are precisely the qualities abstinence promotes. Without personal responsibility, which is recognized throughout society as the basic requirement for life achievement, attempts to reform the current dysfunctional system can have only minor, inconsequential results.

<p>	Taxpayers' money should be used only for social programs that work. If state officials are going to administer these programs, with funding transferred in block grants to the states, they should focus on attacking illegitimacy directly. This includes using funds for abstinence counseling, not merely contraception, and for adoption rather than abortion.1 While plans advanced by the Clinton Administration and the Senate Republican leadership ignore abstinence education as a way to help control illegitimacy, the proposal by Senators Lauch Faircloth (R-NC), Phil Gramm (R-TX), and John Ashcroft (R-MO) earmarks $200 million for such education under the Maternal and Child Health Services Block Grant.2<p>	Young people who want to avoid poverty and dependency can do three things: complete high-school; get a job, even a low-paying one; and have children only within marriage. For several decades, this formula has been ignored in the development of public policy as increasing numbers of unmarried teenage mothers have slipped out of school, out of the economic mainstream, and into dependence. Many remain dependent for long periods of time in spite of attempts by policymakers to reform this key aspect of welfare.3<p>	Responding to growing public concern, President Clinton and many Members of Congress have attempted to focus welfare reform efforts on the illegitimacy crisis. Unfortunately, although official Washington's rhetoric has been stirring, many of these proposals are unchanged from the existing failed strategy.
<p>	While no one can dispute the health advantages of abstinence, and while most people would admit that it is the socially, developmentally, and psychologically appropriate course for an adolescent, there are many who assert that abstinence is impossible for an adolescent. This assertion is groundless. For decades, if not centuries, sexual abstinence was expected of unmarried individuals in Western society. According to the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG), abstinence was the norm among unmarried American teenage girls at least until 1982.4 The best of the recent surveys of high school age youth (young people 14-17 years old) was conducted as part of the National Health Interview Survey of 1992. This survey showed that 56.6 percent of adolescents were virgins.5 A series of surveys conducted over the last 25 years by <i>Who's Who Among American Highschool Students</i> shows that only one in four top students is sexually active. This suggests that abstinence is not only possible, but associated with high levels of personal achievement.6<p><b>UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES</b><p>	Recognizing the struggles and special needs of single parents, American public policy throughout this century has experimented with various forms of aid. Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) began as Aid to Dependent Children (ADC) in the 1935 Social Security Act but was modeled on the cash-grant "Mothers' Aid" programs that various states had developed several decades earlier. As these modest, supervised programs expanded due to legislation, regulations, and court decisions, there was growing concern that for many, welfare dependency was becoming a permanent status, not a transitional phase. A cultural shift accompanied this program expansion: Where previously there was a social and often legal presumption against the ability of an unmarried teenager to raise a child, the perception began to arise that giving birth outside marriage was not only socially acceptable, but also without consequence to children born and raised 
in non-formed families.7<p>	The family is responsible for the basic socialization of children, and when the family breaks down or is never fully formed, children are most affected. They suffer in health, education, and emotional development.8 This is well-documented, but a few facts help to suggest the human impact. White girls growing up fatherless are two and a half times more likely to have a child out of wedlock. For a fatherless white child, the chances of finishing high school drop 40 percent; for a fatherless black child, they drop 70 percent. Yet, as welfare recipients increased in number, in some neighborhoods, children dependent not on a father and mother but on the state became the norm rather than the exception. In these areas, welfare programs are the dominant legal economic force, and recipiency is common among young women.
<p>
	Recognizing that in many communities there is a cycle of poverty, public policy should be concerned about how dependency is transmitted from one generation to the next. Welfare traditionally has focused on adult female recipients; however, their children also merit increased concern. This is especially true for boys growing up without the guidance of fathers in neighborhoods where few boys have the example of fathers who support the family. They are raised by peers on the streets, without social norms, achievable goals, or hope. In the worst cases, their lives are marked by violence and crime, and end early. This is just one more area in which a program meant to do good spawns social disorganization and cultural turmoil.9<p>	Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-NY) relates a conversation between a social scientist who was visiting a poor neighborhood in Chicago and an adolescent living there. The visitor asked the child what she would do when she grew up and was told that she "would draw." Sensing some hope in the bleak surroundings, the visitor asked a follow-up question: "What would you draw?" The girl's answer: "Welfare, like my mother."10 Although the fate of this particular child is not known, examples abound of the subtle yet pervasive draw of welfare in urban areas.<p>	The United States is not alone in its perplexing re-examination of the social effects of such relief programs. A similar review is underway in Britain, where the out-of-wedlock birthrate has risen from 5 percent in 1960 to the current 30 percent. British analysts examining the impact on children note that the weakened family damages society as well, both in taxes and in other social costs, including crime: Armed robberies increased by a factor of eleven in England and Wales between 1970 and 1991.11<p>	The United States is heading in the same direction. Census Bureau figures released in August 1994 show that 19 percent of white children live in single-parent families. Among Hispanics and blacks, the proportions of children living in si
ngle-parent families are 31 percent and 49 percent, respectively. The deleterious influence of single-parent households on welfare costs is apparent to most observers, regardless of political persuasion. Solid welfare reform depends on reducing the proportion of children living in single-parent families. This obviously entails a drastic slowing of illegitimate births, especially illegitimate births to teens. The consensus about illegitimacy and welfare reform breaks down, however, when it comes to how births to unmarried teens are to be reduced. Liberals often recommend increased contraceptive education for teenagers and resort to abortion when contraception fails. Conservatives generally favor a new emphasis on responsibility, virtue, and sexual abstinence in a broad cultural setting.
<p>

<b>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION AND WELFARE REFORM: A CASE STUDY</b>
<p>
	In the 103rd Congress, the Clinton Administration's welfare reform bill (S. 2224) sat sidetracked as intense attention was given health care reform. The bill proposed "to redesign the program of aid to dependent children... [and among other things] prevents dependency.... " Detailed summaries of the bill and Sections 505 and 506 also described the "Teen Pregnancy Prevention Grant Program" by which 1,000 schools and community-based groups would receive grants for "teen pregnancy prevention strategies." Although the bill itself never mentioned the abstinence strategy, this six-page narrative summary includes three surprising references: to "the delay of sexual activity" (twice) and to "premature sexual behavior" (once). Given the growing cultural awareness of the inherent soundness of a prevention strategy based on sexual abstinence, this language seemed to promise dramatic change -- but not for long. These references, when translated into the bureaucratic language of Clinton Administration planners and policies, were contradicted and emptied of meaning.12<p>	<b>Reading the Fine Print.</b> Consider what the Administration meant by "delay of sexual activity" or "premature sexual activity." In the first place, neither "abstinence" nor any related term was to be found in the Administration document. There was no statement that sexual activity is inappropriate for teens or best expressed within marriage. Instead of clearly stating its intentions, the Administration discussed teenage sexual activity with such vague words as "delay" or "premature." Clinton's policy team at the Department of Health and Human Services has a long track record of using ordinary language in misleading ways. For instance, sexual intercourse is "premature" for pre-teens or early teens (11 or 13-year-olds) and should be "delayed" until the age of 16 or 17 years, at which point programs that teach sexual "delay" can shift to contraceptive education. The basis for this educational shift was apparent in the language of the bill summary:
<blockquote>
	Particular emphasis must be paid to the delay of sexual activity and prevention of pregnancy before marriage. Programs that combine these elements have shown the most promise, especially for adolescents who are motivated to avoid pregnancy until they are married.
</blockquote>
	It becomes apparent that "delay of sexual activity" and "prevention of pregnancy" are two very different and contradictory directions.
<p>
	The Clinton document is further decoded by examining the next sentence: "Programs that combine these elements have shown the most promise." The word "combine" refers to the current vogue in sex education of giving the "delay/abstinence" message to young children and then "combining" it with the contraceptive strategy for middle and older teens. Although touted as having "the most promise," this approach has not been effective; only the abstinence component has shown any positive effect.13<p>	These combination programs are called "abstinence plus" by their supporters, largely because they find a way to include the government contraceptive promotion programs that planners favor. The notion that adolescent sexual activity can be divided into two categories -- premature and mature -- did not originate with the policymakers of the Clinton Administration.14 Yet only in a time of policy confusion could such a notion gain a foothold in government programs. Like "safe drug use," "mature adolescent sexual activity" is a contradiction in terms.<p><b>EVOLUTION OF SOCIAL RESPONSE TO UNWED PREGNANCY</b><p>	Expert opinion about teenage pregnancy has undergone continuous change through the last three decades. The grave consequences of high rates of illegitimate births among blacks were first brought to the public's attention by Senator Moynihan in the early 1960s when he was a policy advisor in the administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson. At the time Moynihan issued his first earnest warnings, the proportion of illegitimate births among blacks was about 28 percent -- slightly less than the proportion in society at large today.
<p>
	In the late 1960s, rising levels of premarital sexual activity among many ethnic groups led to concern about the epidemic of births to teenagers. This notion of an epidemic of teen births flourished among policymakers and the public for two decades, despite the fact that demographers such as Maris Vinovskis have shown that the teenage birth rate fell steadily through the 1960s and 1970s. Even a pause in this decline in the late 1980s did not erase the fact that the birth rate to teenage mothers is significantly less now than forty years ago. The number of births to unmarried teens, however, has risen dramatically. The understanding that the epidemic of births to teen mothers is really an epidemic of illegitimacy did not gain currency among policymakers until the 1990s.
<p>
	The success of programs designed to resolve social problems such as teen illegitimacy depends on how those problems are defined. To talk of an "epidemic of births" among teens suggests that teen pregnancy is a medical problem, which in turn suggests that medical science can produce a remedy. In the minds of many social scientists and government policymakers, the obvious answer to this supposed medical problem was to provide teens with birth control drugs and devices. Thus, the federal government's formal family planning program, Title X, passed in 1970 with the general understanding that it would continue to follow the practice of previous efforts by providing services only to married women, soon became strongly oriented to providing contraceptives to unmarried teens.15<p>	Due to the huge growth in the number of abortions among adolescents during the middle and late 1970s, the number of births to teenage mothers declined while the number of teen pregnancies rose dramatically. By the mid-1980s, efforts to reduce teenage pregnancy through sex education and contraception were having no beneficial effect -- perhaps even a deleterious effect.16 About this time, however, it was becoming clear that AIDS also could be a disease of heterosexuals. Very quickly, the problem of teenage sexuality was redefined: The major threat now was sexually transmitted disease.
<p>
	Until a few years ago, the prevailing view among health educators such as Debra Haffner17 was that it was useless to try to frighten teenagers with the consequences of sexual activity. Increasing fear about AIDS, for instance, would render teens unable to take positive action, such as condom use, which could reduce the risk of AIDS transmission. Of course, in this view, the possibility of paralyzing teenagers with fear went only so far; they did not believe, for instance, that fear-induced paralysis would render teenagers reluctant or unable to engage in sexual activity.
<p>
	The evolution of sex education programs has been described at length by Douglas Kirby, Ph.D., of ETR Associates in Scotts Valley, California. Kirby has categorized sex education curricula into four generations. The first generation "focused primarily on increasing students' knowledge about sexuality and on emphasizing the risks and consequences of pregnancy."18 The second placed more emphasis on values clarification and decision-making skills. The third developed "in reaction or opposition to" the first two. Kirby describes the third generation in the following terms:
<blockquote>
	Concerned that the first two generations of programs were "value free," and supported by a moralistic and ideological fervor, a different group of people developed programs consistently emphasizing the message that young people should not engage in intercourse until marriage. To avoid any possibility of a double message, these programs commonly did not discuss contraception.19</blockquote>	The fourth generation of programs, including one of Kirby's, "represents a synthesis of the first three." These programs "are neither value-free nor moralistic.... Instead, they emphasize that it is a good idea for young teenagers to delay sex and that it is important for all young people to practice effective contraception if they are going to have sex."20<p>	Kirby notes that the first generation of programs imparted knowledge about sex but failed to achieve the desired results: "It has subsequently become more widely recognized... that knowledge about issues such as contraception is only weakly related to behavior, and that increased knowledge may not produce much of a reduction in risk-taking behavior."21 As for the second generation, which stressed values clarification, "when specific values were not given prominent emphasis in the course, there was little evidence of impact."22 Kirby concedes that the third generation (based on abstinence) managed in the short run to change attitudes about premarital intercourse. With regard to changing behavior through abstinence, Kirby remarks that few published studies have examined this topic and notes that "the methods used in those studies have been somewhat limited, but thus far those evaluations indicate that the programs did not delay intercourse or reduce frequency of intercourse."23<p>	Kirby reserves his praise for fourth-generation programs, which he says have shown an ability to delay the initiation of intercourse. He arrives at this result by assigning a program, Postponing Sexual Involvement, to the fourth generation despite the fact that it was funded by the federa
l government as an abstinence-only program. To justify his categorization, Kirby argues that "Although the program focused on delaying sexual intercourse, Postponing Sexual Involvement was not moralistic, and it differed in other important ways from the third generation of programs."24 The nature of these important differences is never explained.
<p>
	This account of the evolution of teen pregnancy prevention programs is artificial and does not comport fully with the classifications of funding agencies. Moreover, Kirby's classifications dilute the effect of abstinence-only programs. Programs that are similar in content and approach are segregated according to whether they are considered moralistic. This points out a central feature of the academic discussion of adolescent sex: Academics and policymakers generally focus only on the physical consequences of sexual activity, such as pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease. Psychological and spiritual consequences of early sexual involvement rarely receive consideration. Even topics like the coercion of teenage girls by older males, which would seem certain to elicit strong reactions, until very recently have not garnered much attention from academics and policymakers.
<p>
	Though Kirby's analysis fails to give abstinence programs the credit they deserve, it does contain some interesting news: Abstinence programs can be successful without an overt appeal to traditional morality. There appears to be enough evidence about the health and career advantages of abstinence to persuade most young adolescents that it is the best course to follow. Indeed, overt appeals to morality actually may work against the success of an abstinence program for certain teenage audiences. For those adolescents who regard themselves more as consumers in a marketplace of ideas than as heirs to the intellectual heritage of their parents, traditional values and good ideas must be marketed creatively.
<p>
	Fourth-generation, or "abstinence plus," sex education programs are sophisticated and well-presented but have not demonstrated success in delaying the initiation of sexual activity. They can claim success only by defining it in very broad terms. They claim success when sexual initiation is delayed, when frequency of sexual activity is decreased, or when contraceptive use is increased. Promoters of "abstinence-only" programs in general do not even bother to measure frequency of sexual activity or use of contraceptives, for they realize that social and psychological damage results from the premature initiation of sexual activity. Using contraceptives merely avoids part of the adverse consequences of sex for a teen.
<p>
	Ignoring the psychological realities of teenage sex also helps demonstrate why "abstinence plus" programs are not likely to be successful. Teenagers in these programs understand that they are being offered two mutually exclusive lines of behavior by adults associated with trusted institutions. If these options are presented as equally good, teens naturally will pick the one that costs them less -- or, put another way, that forces them to relinquish less. It is no surprise that even highly touted "abstinence plus" programs such as Reducing the Risk have not managed to increase abstinence.
<p>

<b>ADOLESCENTS AND THE RISKS THEY FACE</b>
<p>
	Many adolescents face multiple risks in the transition to adulthood: lack of future orientation and discipline, poverty, dropping out of school, family instability, pressures for sexual activity, alcohol and drug abuse. Although adolescents, because of their developmental status, tend to misunderstand and minimize the seriousness of these risks, the phenomenon is more pronounced in youths who lack real direction in their lives.25<p>	Teenagers generally have other developmental limitations as well. According to developmental psychologist Erik Erikson, adolescents are incapable of the intimacy that comes with committed love. Also, on the practical side, adolescents are poor and inconsistent contraceptors even though current oral contraceptives are low-dose formulations that should be taken every day at the same time.
<p>
	In dealing with children with multiple risks, the Clinton Administration argues that "for those populations where adolescent pregnancy is a symptom of deeper problems, education and contraceptive services alone will be inadequate; they must be part of a much wider spectrum of services." This correctly identifies the need for intensive services for adolescents who believe, because of cultural or peer pressure, that having children out of wedlock is a desirable goal. One defect of this strategy, however, is the inclusion of the contraceptive element; adolescents would be left to the same risks and cultural pressures, only with suggestions to go about them more carefully. This guarantees that the "new" approach would collapse upon itself.
<p>
	<b>Personal Responsibility.</b> A safe transition to adulthood requires the development of self-respect, self-restraint, and orientation to achievable life goals, summed up in the traditional recognition that the successful and good life requires the cultivation of virtue. Adult direction, good counsel along the way, and growth in virtue are all essential to youth. Yet adolescents with multiple risks (such as unformed families, low levels of education, or low socioeconomic status) are excluded all but systematically from this vision of life; it is assumed to be impossible for them. At the same time, they are exposed constantly to the most self-destructive behaviors, including illegal drug and alcohol use. Adolescents at high risk for self-destructive behavior also have the greatest need for life orientation, hope, and virtue.
<P>
	If personal virtue is the key to responsible adulthood, programs that claim to prevent dependency must address the real needs of adolescents by focusing on these elements and equipping young people for adult responsibilities. Any other program modifications will not be worth the effort.
<P>

<b>TEENS, CONTRACEPTION, AND BIRTH</b>
<p>
	Casual observers often attribute the rise in single-parent households to a putative rise in the teen birth rate. This is not entirely accurate. As noted above, historically speaking, the teen birth rate is at a low level. The National Center for Health Statistics makes this point precisely: In 1970 the birth rate for 15-19 year olds was 68.3 for every thousand girls of that age; in 1992, it was 60.7. During the same period, the rate of births to unmarried teens almost doubled, rising from 22.4 per thousand to 44.6 per thousand.26 Nevertheless, the birthrate for unmarried teens is still less than the birthrate for unmarried women in their twenties. It is these illegitimate births among adolescents and young adults which have particular relevance to welfare programs and policies. The epidemic of illegitimacy among all age groups is a cultural rather than a biological or technical problem. The remedy must be cultural as we<p>

	President Clinton's Work and Responsibility Act of 1994 is probably a good indication of future liberal policy proposals. It acknowledged that the increase in illegitimate births to adolescent mothers has a serious impact on the nation's social welfare system, and Sections 505 and 506 ostensibly answered the problem of births to unwed teenage mothers. Unfortunately, it seems the Clinton plan tried to rectify the problem of early unwed motherhood through sex education and school-based clinics featuring contraception. The Work and Responsibility Act presupposed these techniques would cause teens to have intercourse in ways that reduce the likelihood of pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease. The Act identified this as "sexual responsibilit<p>

	This attempt to make sexual activity safe for teens is not novel; its failures are visible everywhere. Except for a pause in the early 1980s, pregnancy rates for 15-19 year olds have risen over the last 25 years to the present high of 111 pregnancies for every thousand girl<p>

	Another unfortunate physical consequence of the attempt to render sex safe for teens is an epidemic of sexually transmitted disease. The U.S. Public Health Service estimated in 1989 that one in four sexually active teens will be infected eventually with a sexually transmitted disease. The federal Centers for Disease Control estimate that there are at least 12 million new cases of such disease every year. Since many sexually transmitted diseases such as AIDS, herpes, genital warts, and hepatitis B have a viral etiology, they are incurable. Because viral STDs are lifelong, some estimates suggest that one in five Americans eventually will contract a viral STD.27 Obviously, not all of these people are adolescents, but in an era of multiple sexual partners, everyone in the pool of sexually active people is at risk<p>	In addition, certain nonphysical dangers of early sexuality often are ignored, either because they are not visible or because they are not easily quantifiable. Poor academic grades and a decrease in orientation toward the future have been documented among adolescents who initiated sexual intercourse prior to marriage.28 Unfortunately, disillusionment with life (sometimes called a broken spirit) is a consequence that is not susceptible to public health analysis.<P>	Family disruption and a tendency to engage in other risky behaviors such as drinking also are associated with early sexual activity. Recent studies performed for the state of Illinois by John Vessey, Ph.D., of Northwestern University quantify several risk factors for premarital sexual activity. Not having two parents in the home and believing that parents accept adolescent sexual activity are associated with a doubling of the chances that a teen will have premarital sex. Smoking and frequent drinking are associated, respectively, with fourfold and sixfold increases in the likelihood of premarital sex. Believing that condoms are safe is associated with a fivefold increase.29<P><b>REASONS FOR FAILURE OF "RESPONSIBLE TEEN SEX"30</b><P>	
The inability of adolescents to shield themselves from the adverse consequences of early sexual activity is not due to poor technology. Theoretically, there is not much room for improvement in the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives (oral pills or implanted capsules). There may be some room to reduce their unhealthful or unpleasant side effects, but the natural tendency of scientific research is to concentrate on the more important risks, such as breast cancer, heart attack, or stroke, rather than on minor side effects like acne, weight gain, or hair loss that are important to image-conscious teenagers. Considering the purpose of hormonal contraception -- to alter the natural process of ovulation --some side effects are unavoidable.
<P>	By far the greatest impediments to efficient pregnancy prevention through contraceptives are human error and failure to use these devices. According to one large, well-controlled study, 58 percent of women forgot to take their oral contraceptive pills every day, and 80 percent failed to take them at the same time every day as prescribed.31 This study included women of all ages, with the mean age over 20; it is recognized generally that the level of compliance with contraception protocols among teenagers is much worse than for the population of women as a whole. This helps explain why there are millions of unplanned pregnancies even though 90.1 percent of sexually active American women use some type of contraception.32 Failure to comply with professionals' prescriptions must be regarded as one of the immutable facts of contraceptive life.
<P>
	It may be argued that failure to follow medical recommendations does not affect so-called passive methods of contraception, such as Norplant. Hence, when Norplant was approved for the market in 1991, many family planning advocates hailed it as the "magic bullet" that would end unintended pregnancy among teenagers and others likely to forget their pills. Within months, all state Medicaid programs were paying for Norplant.
<P>
	Researchers became concerned that the euphoria surrounding the arrival of a low-effort, long-term contraceptive might cause users to become careless about their reproductive health practices. With funds from the U.S. Public Health Service, a large study was initiated on a population of Medicaid women in Arkansas, one of the leading states in Norplant use. The study confirms some of the fears of reproductive health professionals: Medicaid women with Norplant are more likely to miss regularly scheduled gynecological screenings, more likely to contract sexually transmitted diseases, and less likely to get needed services. This study contains no information on whether individuals with Norplant have more sexual partners, though such data certainly would be relevant to the spread of sexually transmitted disease.33 Another large study, conducted in Baltimore to compare adolescent and adult Norplant users, revealed that only 13-18 percent of users returned for their routine follow-up examinations.34<P>	When confronted with the failure of prescription contraceptives to protect against sexually transmitted disease, proponents of birth control for adolescents respond with condoms. But family planning professionals historically have been reluctant to recommend condoms for pregnancy prevention because of their high failure rate. The contraceptive failure rate among young, low-income women who use condoms, oral contraceptives, or diaphragms is shown below.<P>	 These rates reflect failure to prevent pregnancy. There are no specific data about the failure rate of barrier contraceptive methods in preventing sexually transmitted diseases. Some published studies indicate slippage and breakage rates exceeding 14 percent, even among experienced condom users.35 It would be a mistake, however, to equate every instance of slippage and breakage with an accidental pregnancy or the transmission of a disease. Condoms often slip or break without resulting in an STD or a pregnancy; conversely, an STD or a pregnancy can occur in spite o
f an intact condom. Even an intact condom cannot necessarily prevent the spread of serious sexually transmitted diseases. Human papillomavirus (HPV), the agent which causes genital warts and the root cause of most of the nation's 6,000 cervical cancer deaths per year, can exist in parts of the genital region not covered by condoms.36<P>	<b>Teens and Condoms.</b> In view of high contraceptive failure rates, responsible reproductive health professionals have concluded that the minimum standard for reducing the chances of pregnancy or sexually transmitted disease is to use a hormonal method and a barrier method simultaneously. This "dual use" is what the Public Health Service recommended in 1990 as a fallback position for adolescents who do not remain abstinent.37 More recently, Dr. David Kessler, head of the Food and Drug Administration, correctly decried the tendency of health professionals to give dangerously insufficient advice regarding contraception: "you don't hear people saying use Norplant plus a condom... or oral contraceptives plus a condom. That's not being said and it needs to be said."38<P>	Unfortunately, family planning professionals have neglected this message. Perhaps they are reluctant to spread the message of dual use because they recognize that it complicates sexual activity and, thus, that many sexually active people will be loath to heed it. Acceptance of dual contraceptive methods is very low; the Public Health Service estimates that only 2 percent of sexually active teens attain even this insufficient standard of risk reduction.39<P>	What dooms dual use as a means of risk reduction for teens is what has always plagued barrier methods and hormonal contraceptives separately: Many adolescents simply do not want to use them. This indifference to contraception points to a central fact of developmental psychology: that teenagers and adults evaluate risks differently. The cognitive pattern that characterizes most people in early and middle adolescence (sometimes called concrete operational t
hought) is characterized by haphazard processing of information and failure to anticipate future outcomes of actions.40 This predisposition makes it difficult for teens to use contraception effectively and consistently. In many cases, their low ability to take positive action to reduce the risks associated with sex is impaired further by drugs or alcohol. The failure to take these facts into account has undermined many pregnancy prevention programs, especially those based on contraception.<P>
	The contraceptive approach to adolescent pregnancy prevention faces also more formidable obstacles than teenagers' psychological disinclination to use inconvenient contraceptive methods. In some areas, statistics show that 70-90 percent of the children of teenage mothers were fathered by men in their twenties.41 Thus, what is commonly described as the teen pregnancy problem actually involves more than teenagers.<P>	Men in their twenties enjoy a certain status with teenage girls simply because of their age. In the current social climate, there is little disadvantage to a young adult male in fathering a child out of wedlock. Perversely, he incurs financial responsibilities only if he admits paternity. In many states, a declaration of paternity made in the hospital when his child is born has no legal effect; he must repeat the statement in court. These slightly older men are not above using force or coercion to make sexual conquests. Social science research only recently has begun to plumb the depths of coercive sex suffered by teenagers.42 It is no wonder that in a national survey, a plurality of teens regarded pressure to have sex as the greatest threat to their well-being.43<P>	The fact that men who impregnate teenage girls are often in their twenties points to a serious problem in current adolescent pregnancy-prevention programs: We cannot reach these young adults with school-based campaigns. These young men are not impressed with any contraceptive method because fathering a child out of wedlock brings them only advantages (unless they marry). Previous cultural and legal prohibitions about older males' being involved sexually with teens have loosened. As damaging as this is in itself, it leads to another problem: Teenage males, who tend to model their actions on the behavior of their slightly older counterparts, try to act out their own version of this life. Thus, a vicious cycle is born. In terms of sexually transmitted disease, substance abuse, and non-marital sexual activity, the early twenties are an 
even more troubled age than the teen years.
<P>

<b>FALSE DIAGNOSES</b>
<P>
	Adolescents do not lack information about sex. Aside from the continual media onslaught, there are numerous sources of formal education about sexuality, contraception, and sexually transmitted disease. A recent survey shows that 93 percent of U.S. high schools offer classes on sexuality and AIDS.44 According to a national study of 15-19 year old males, a large majority (79 percent) had received formal instruction about birth control. Unfortunately, only 58 percent had received formal instruction about resisting pressure to engage in sexual activity.45<P>	It is also clear that the high rate of repeat pregnancy among teens cannot be attributed to ignorance about sexual matters. A study of contraceptive use and repeat pregnancy among welfare-dependent teenage mothers found that half had become pregnant again within two years even though the majority were using some method of contraception.46<P>	<b>Funding for Pregnancy Prevention.</b> Despite its frequent portrayal as a national problem, federal funding for adolescent contraception is ample. Overall, the federal government spends about $1 billion per year on family planning. These expenditures include Title X of the Public Health Service Act (family planning for low-income persons) and Title XIX of the Social Security Act (Medicaid, which pays for more contraceptive services than any other program), but not matching funds from the states or other institutions. Judging from the age distribution of Title X clients, about $300 million of this money is devoted to adolescents each year. On the other hand, the Office of Adolescent Pregnancy Programs, which runs the only federal program dedicated to promoting sexual abstinence (Title XX of the Public Health Service Act), spends about $1.9 million for that purpose annually. If there is a funding problem for adolescent sexuality programs, it is only that current funding is misdirected.47<P>	Asked to explain the absence of evidence that their programs work, proponents of contraceptive education fall back on arguments
 of "face validity." All this means is that, on its face, a program seems as if it ought to work. When "experts" state that contraceptive education programs have "face validity," they are saying that they believe imparting information, regardless of its quality or evidence of any effect, is good. Yet proponents of abstinence in Congress and elsewhere have not been able to invoke face validity to support their programs. In the hands of abstinence proponents, face validity is considered offensively moralistic. Thus, in a field with a perennial scarcity of solid data, policy arguments all favor the contraceptive side.
<P>
	Without any persuasive evidence that it benefits adolescent development, or that it is effective when used, the contraceptive approach is regarded most appropriately not as a pragmatic policy choice, but as an ideology, though admittedly one that remains widely respected.48<P><b>WHAT WORKS TO REDUCE ADOLESCENT PREGNANCY</b><P>
	When seeking what works to reduce teenage pregnancy, federal and state policymakers should not search primarily among federal government programs. Some successes have been achieved in the Title XX Adolescent Family Life program, but its tiny size and the bureaucratic and legislative constraints under which it labors have prevented it from having a substantial impact.49<P>	The Title XX program does serve, however, as a useful point of departure in exploring successful abstinence programs. The program funded ground-breaking research on the precursors and consequences of sexual activity among unmarried adolescents. Among its findings were that a family's pattern of communication affected the abstinence behavior of adolescents. In particular, good communication between adolescents and their mothers tended to promote abstinent behavior. Title XX-funded research also documented that adolescent initiation of sexual intercourse had a negative effect on the reported academic grades of white males, as well as on the college aspirations of white females.50<P>	Influenced perhaps by polls which found that 65 percent of teenagers thought the most effective way to convince their peers to postpone sex would be to describe the dangers of diseases like herpes and AIDS,51 many early Title XX programs emphasized the adverse consequences of early sexuality. This approach failed for two major reasons. First, these programs tried to focus teens' attention on the grim facts of AIDS and sexually transmitted disease while AIDS advocates and most of the public health establishment were asserting that grim outcomes generally could be avoided with condoms. Second, the adverse consequences approach did not give sufficient weight to the statements of adolescents who actually had abstained. According to a poll of adolescents who abstained (the Gallup Study of American Youth, 1977-1988), 55 percent were concerned about pregnancy, but 75 percent wanted to save sex until marriage.
<P>
	Nabers Cabaniss Johnson, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Population Affairs at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services from 1987-1990 and director of the Title XX program, credited a project conducted by the Search Institute of Minnesota with finding that "knowledge alone has little effect on sexual decision-making and that teens' own values and strength of conviction about what is right far outweigh peer pressure or fear of consequences."52<P>	Willingness to abstain, then, is the heart of the matter. It is unlikely that the desire to wait can be taught in the didactic sense. But if the culture at large, the neighborhood culture, or even the subculture at school supports the virtue of abstinence, well-designed programs can help a teen to practice it. Abstinence programs over the years have developed effective methods, such as resistance skills, which teens can use to implement their convictions. American culture must provide the concepts of virtue toward which adolescents can strive.
<P>
	The Title XX program has funded about 75 abstinence projects across the country since 1981. Remarkably, by law, this portion of Title XX could be no more than half as big as the portion devoted to caring for teens already pregnant or rearing young children. The abstinence projects were located in urban, suburban, and rural areas. Because Title XX was a demonstration program, the projects it funded generally were quite small.
<P>
<b>DEMONSTRATED EFFECTS OF ABSTINENCE PROGRAMS</b>
<P>
	Ideological opponents of the abstinence approach, such as former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders, suggest that abstinence cannot be promoted successfully among teens. Yet even those who oppose abstinence programs recognize that the small projects funded by Title XX generally have produced favorable cognitive and attitudinal results. These programs meet the standard stated by the summary of Sections 505 and 506 in the Clinton plan, and yet they have no real chance of approval as part of the Clinton Administration's program.
<P>	The "gold standard" among sex education or abstinence programs is not whether they increase knowledge, or even whether they change attitudes. The important achievement is to affect behavior. In this regard, the Title XX program has enjoyed notable success.53<P>	A program called Preventing Sexual Involvement (PSI) was conducted by Emory University faculty members at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia, in 1983. Since it received funding under Title XX, it was by definition an abstinence-only program. The study population was entirely urban, poor, and African-American. A scientific evaluation of PSI showed that adolescents who went through the program were significantly less likely to initiate sexual activity than similar adolescents in a control group. The beneficial results were recorded in a Public Health Service document entitled "Adolescent Family Life Program; Highlights from Prevention Projects":
<blockquote>
	During the year that the students participated (eighth grade), nonprogram students were five times more likely to begin sexual activity during the school year than were program students (20 percent vs. 4 percent). The differences were greater for girls (15 percent vs. 1 percent) than they were for boys (29 percent vs. 8 percent). At the end of the ninth grade, the differences between non-program and program students continued (39 percent vs. 24 percent) even though no additional program involvement was provided.
</blockquote>
	Another program which apparently has reduced the level of sexual activity among adolescents is Reducing the Risk (RTR). Unlike PSI, RTR was not eligible for Title XX funding because it included a contraception message in addition to its abstinence message. The scientific evaluations of both programs specifically attribute resulting favorable changes in behavior to their abstinence components. As Kirby states in his evaluation of RTR, "In combination with the findings from the evaluation of PSI, this suggests that it may actually be easier to delay the onset of sexual activity than to increase contraceptive practice."54<P>	Another Title XX abstinence project was conducted by the American Home Economics Association. An independent analysis of data from Project Taking Charge, made by a federal evaluator, showed that this project also reduced the likelihood of premarital sexual activity among adolescents who participated in the program.55<P>	<b>Adolescent Acceptance of Abstinence.</b> Other successful abstinence programs have been developed without funding from Title XX or any other government source. In the schools of Conway, Arkansas (population 38,000), a concerned parent named Thelma Moton and a group of volunteers have conducted the EXCEL program for three years. EXCEL accepts no government funds because of an abiding belief that promoting civic virtue is a community's own responsibility. With the expertise of volunteers from among medical professionals, educators, parents, and older students, EXCEL has provided semester-long programs for 1,300 junior high students each year. Though a scientific evaluation of the program has just been initiated, a preliminary survey showed that 27 percent of students in the program were sexually active as opposed to 31 percent of those who were not in the program.
<P>
	The EXCEL program makes good use of the prestige of senior high school students willing to "admit" that they have not engaged in sex. Younger students report that they are relieved to hear these "admissions" because they remove the peer pressure to engage in risky activities. EXCEL uses the same method to reduce other risky behaviors such as drinking and drug use.
<P>
	Like PSI and RTR, EXCEL teaches refusal skills, or methods by which students can resist pressure from peers to indulge in sex, drinking, or drugs without becoming a social outcast. Refusal skills are practiced through role-playing and are considered crucial by the EXCEL staff. According to Thelma Moton, "If you don't have refusal skills, you don't have a program."56 Practicing refusal skills is common in successful risk-reduction programs. Clearly, today's adolescent culture filters out fewer expressions of deviancy. Though this creates a more tolerant society in a superficial sense, it also generates more overt pressure on teens to participate in activities they may consider frightening.

<P>	Contrary to the expectations of many adults, the majority of teens seem interested in what abstinence-based programs might have to offer. A survey of 1,000 girls conducted by Emory University found that of a dozen possible sex education topics, the most popular (chosen by 84 percent of the respondents) was more information on how to say "no" to a boyfriend's requests for sex without losing the boyfriend.57 It is also evident from a February 1994 Roper Starch poll that 12-17 year olds regard the pressure to have sex as the prime threat to their well-being.58 It seems obvious that adolescents have been calling on adults to protect them with reasonable behavioral limits. For many years, however, the vogue in child-rearing was to ignore such calls.<P>	Another common characteristic of successful programs is an approach that recognizes and responds to the needs of the individual.59 For example, Washington, D.C.'s Best Friends program, directed by Elayne Bennett, works with girls who are at high risk for adolescent pregnancy. It asks them to remain abstinent through completion of high school. By pairing each girl in a mentoring relationship with a mature, stable woman, the program takes advantage of adolescents' tendency to model their behavior on the actions of slightly older people, thus starting what might be called a virtuous cycle. It also builds group identity and celebrates life events, such as completion of the school year and academic success. As of 1993, Best Friends had graduated over 500 young women without a single instance of pregnancy.
<P>	Further evidence that abstinence programs can have a positive effect on children with multiple risks is found in the Hoyleton project. Evaluators of this East St. Louis, Illinois, project funded by the Title XX abstinence program found that it combines classroom instruction with an after-school program to channel the energies and promote the further development of children enrolled in the classroom element. In addition, it involves parents as the primary sexuality educators of their children and provides academic tutoring, field trips, and games. This program attempts explicitly to change the cultural influences on children, thereby helping to give them a new vision of the possibilities beyond their present circumstances. This would be accomplished by helping teenagers avoid sexual activity, drug, and alcohol use, all of which are symptomatic of crisis in adolescents.
<P>
	The programs that work are the ones that focus on adolescents as individuals during the transition to adulthood, a time fraught with risk, especially for those with weak or nonexistent parental assistance or other adult role models. These programs recognize, implicitly or explicitly, that the rise in adolescent pregnancy has significant psychological and cultural implications. Therefore, their approach is not merely to give large numbers of teens more information. Programs that have relied simply on dispensing information have not been successful in reducing teen pregnancies, whether the information was on abstinence or contraception.
<P>

<b>WHAT POLICYMAKERS CAN DO</b>
<P>

<b>1) Employ abstinence counseling.</b>
<P>
	Considering that about one young woman in five makes her first family planning visit before initiating sexual activity, there is a strong possibility that abstinence counseling could be effective.60 Directive abstinence counseling has not been tried widely because it runs counter to the philosophical views of most family planning clinicians. But directive counseling is accepted and encouraged with respect to contraception. As we have seen, it is regarded by some experts as essential to gaining contraceptive compliance from teenagers.61 If directive counseling can persuade teens to use certain types of contraception, there should be no ethical objection to using it to promote abstinence.
<P>
	If the teen already is sexually active, counseling could be geared toward what some teens describe as "secondary virginity." At least one survey has discovered that many teens who have had one occasion of sexual intercourse view it as an aberration they are unlikely to repeat.62<P><b>2) Promote adoption counseling.</b><P>	In cases where pregnancy already has occurred, adoption can break the cycle of welfare dependence. Despite its overwhelmingly positive outcome, however, only rarely is adoption described as an option by counselors who favor the contraceptive approach to reducing births among teens.63<P><b>3) Establish parity for abstinence programs.</b><P>	Congress is considering block grants as a major part of welfare reform. Abstinence programs can help stem the tide of early teen sexual involvement, but they must be accorded the same treatment that state and federally funded contraceptive programs now enjoy. Block grants should provide that opportunity. At the state level, officials can plant well-designed programs across communities so that they support each other and achieve a critical mass. The goal of government-supported abstinence campaigns is not necessarily to make it possible for every adolescent to be in a government-funded abstinence program. Rather, the idea is to make communities aware that government tangibly supports the idea of adolescent development rooted in abstinence, risk avoidance, and the attainment of positive life goals.
<P>
	In an era when teens spend an average of 80 hours per week watching TV or listening to the radio,64 it would be of inestimable value for state and local officials to provide grants to local private organizations for media campaigns to support the idea of abstinence -- for example, to disabuse teens of the idea that they are the last virgins in their schools or neighborhoods.65 Teens respond more to what they believe their peers are doing than to what their peers actually do. The success of local and nationwide abstinence promotion efforts like True Love Waits, which has been recognized even by national news magazines, demonstrates that teens will take up the abstinence message gladly if given a rallying point.
<P>

<b>THE LONG-TERM SOLUTION: MASSIVE CULTURAL REALIGNMENT </b>
<P>
	"Abandoning the poor" is hardly a responsible position, yet AFDC, as we know it, itself abandons the poor. More taxpayers today are aware that AFDC recipients who enter the program as adolescent mothers will be the longest recipients, will remain mired in poverty, and most likely will never marry or complete high school. At best, AFDC provides some income support for poor mothers and their children. At worst, it perpetuates cultural patterns that encourage illegitimacy, family non-formation, and difficulties for mothers and children steeped in the subculture of dependency.
<P>
	The roots of today's dependency problem lie in a lack of hope for any achievable life goals and the collapse of cultural support for marriage and removal of any shame or stigma attached to illegitimacy. When this is recognized by those who make public policy, truly creative responses to the needs of these young women can be crafted. At the same time, promotion of abstinence, personal respect, and responsibility must be the "new" approach in any welfare reform proposals geared to preventing dependency. Abstinence programs must be part of a whole, unambiguous cultural message that promotes responsibility in all facets of life, including the sexual. Abstinence is the hallmark of responsibility. This message must be directed at both sexes and at all ages.
<P>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>

<P>	Well-designed abstinence programs can help teens as individuals, but the environment in which they live is also important.66 Thus, it is necessary for state and local policymakers to support efforts, such as the Hoyleton project in East St. Louis and similar programs, which promote positive cultural influences in the lives of adolescents.<P>	The Clinton Administration's claim that responsibility means using a contraceptive during non-marital sex turns the concept of responsibility on its head. The failed and feeble notion of sexual responsibility embodied in the Administration's Work and Responsibility Act would infect every program that accepts it. Participants would soon perceive that "responsibility" is a matter not of choices and behavior, but of acquiring new technology (or merely new terminology).
<P>
	Policymakers instead should promote reforms that encourage personal responsibility. Only this can rescue another generation from dependency. Such a program would represent a true commitment to young people in their struggle to deal with difficult life issues. It would help them form and reach achievable goals, would give them hope, and would increase their chances of becoming responsible adults.

<li>The Faircloth-Gramm-Ashcroft proposal focuses abstinence education on the social, psychological, and health gains of abstaining from sexual activity while unmarried; backs abstinence from sexual activity outside of marriage as the "expected standard" for school-age children; teaches that abstinence from sexual activity is the only certain way to avoid out-of-wedlock pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases; teaches that marriage is the "expected standard" of human sexual activity; teaches that sexual activity outside of marriage is likely to have "harmful psychological and physical effects"; and teaches that bearing children out of wedlock is likely to have "harmful consequences" for the child, his parents, and society.
<li>The Urban Institute estimates that slightly over half of those currently on welfare will become long-term dependents (on the welfare rolls for 5 years or more). The length of time unmarried adolescent mothers typically spend as AFDC recipients is widely recognized as twice that spent by recently divorced mothers, for whom the program generally is truly transitional.

<li>The measure of behavioral change usually is sexual activity, which is difficult to measure. At best, programs which have attempted to measure this variable have relied on the self-reporting of adolescents. Some analysts have suggested strongly that adolescents greatly exaggerate their sexual activity. Males, "School Age Pregnancy:  Why Hasn't Prevention Worked?"  Considering some of the extreme reports that have appeared recently in the social science literature -- for example, that 13 percent of ten-year-old girls and 28 percent of ten-year-old boys in an urban population had initiated sexual intercourse -- it seems likely that the self reports are exaggerated. D. Romer <i>et al.</i>, "Social Influences on the Sexual Behavior of Youth at Risk for HIV Exposure," <i>American Journal of Public Health</i>, Vol. 84, No. 6 (June 1994), pp. 977-985. This tendency to exaggerate coital activity is an important factor in teen sexuality because teens are highly influenced in their sexual behavior by what they think their peers are doing. This becomes a vicious cycle because teens consistently overestimate the sexual activity of their peers.

Backgrounder No. 1045<br>July 27, 1995<br><HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%> <p></center><b>INTRODUCTION</b><p>	With the national out-of-wedlock birthrate heading toward 40 percent by the year 2000, and 50 percent around the year 2012, lawmakers are concerned about the increase in abused and neglected children which likely will accompany this disturbing trend. There now are close to 500,000 children in the foster care system,2 but only about 50,000 are cleared for adoption each year. Because of bureaucratic obstacles, many of these children cannot find a permanent, loving home.3<p>	The comprehensive House welfare reform bill (H.R. 4, the Personal Responsibility Act) tries to address this problem by rewarding states for reducing their out-of-wedlock birthrate without resorting to abortion. But another way is to increase early adoptions of neglected children. During the congressional debate, some Members balked at trying to reduce the illegitimacy rate, fearing they might appear harsh or uncaring toward the young unwed mother and her child. For these lawmakers and others with similar apprehensions, adoption is a solution that is kind to both mother and child. Its advantage is well documented:  a better life.
<p>
	The House-passed tax reform bill (H.R. 1215) also encourages adoption. To help defray the significant costs involved, a couple whose income is below $60,000 receives a $5,000 tax credit. This credit is reduced gradually for couples with incomes between $60,000 and $100,000 and phased out at incomes above $100,000. While significant, however, this step will not lead to a major increase in adoption unless the barriers to adoption in the social service bureaucracy are removed by congressional and state action.
<P>
	Adoption rates have declined in recent decades as adoption has fallen out of favor with state governments and the social services establishment. In 1979, 598,000 babies were born out of wedlock; almost one in four was adopted. In 1991, of the 1,225,000 born out of wedlock, only one in 25 was adopted. Yet public interest has increased:  close to two million couples would like to adopt these children. Clearly, the problem is far more basic than any financial burden that may be involved.
<P>
	Because of the vast need for adoption and the large pool of parents willing to adopt, Congress not only should encourage adoptions through generous tax relief for adopting parents, but also must change the public social service ethos by eliminating all barriers to speedy and permanent adoption.
<P>
	The simplest and fastest way to bring about these improvements is to privatize all adoption services. Government agencies have institutional strengths in applying and enforcing the law, but private institutions can better harness the human qualities needed to nurture and develop children. To encourage adoption through private organizations, and to reduce barriers to adoption through government agencies, Congress, the Administration, and the states need to take several important actions.
<P>
<B>What the federal government should do:</B>
<P><ul>
<LI> Enact a means-tested, fully refundable, inflation-adjusted tax credit of up to $5,000 for non-recurring adoption expenses.<P>

<li> Hold hearings on the Clinton Administration's blocking of a very effective drug testing and treatment program for cocaine-addicted pregnant mothers. If necessary, pass legislation to reverse the Administration's action.<P>

<LI> Issue annual report cards on the rate of adoption in each state.<P>

<LI> Require federally funded family planning services to provide clear and accurate information on the benefits of adoption to all out-of-wedlock teenage mothers.<P>

<LI> Make it easy for all churches, particularly black churches that serve the poor, to affiliate with adoption agencies and become involved in the adoption process as outreach to prospective adopting parents.<P>

<LI> Ensure the civil rights of all children in foster care and modify the Multi-Ethnic Placement Act to prohibit any use of race or ethnicity to deny or delay the placement of a child for foster care or adoption.<P>

<li> Change the Indian Child Welfare Act to curtail the reach of Indian Nation law over those who have emigrated from those communities and societies.
<P>
<LI> Reject the language in the U.N. Charter on the Rights of the Child.
<P></ul>
<b>What the states should do:</b>
<P><ul>
<li> Privatize adoption services.
<P>
<LI> Change the way public welfare agencies are financed so that they are obliged to contract for all public adoptions.
<P>
<LI> Establish separate units at the county level to assist the courts in making speedy and appropriate judgments.
<p>
<LI> Maintain special Medicaid coverage for all special-needs adopted children.
<P>
<LI> Remove obstacles to transracial adoptions.
<P>
<li> Use leadership opportunities to encourage adoption.
<P>
<li> Establish separate units for termination of the parental rights of convicted abusing parents.
<p>
<LI> Enact a strict 12-month timeline for adjudication of the long-term parental status of every child in foster care.
<p>
<LI> Centralize the collection of state data on all formal adoptions and foster care actions.
<P>
<li> Enact legislation subjecting public social service agencies to the same licensing standards and requirements as those imposed on private adoption agencies.
<P>
<LI> Mandate drug testing of pregnant mothers suspected of drug abuse, particularly cocaine abuse.
<P>
<li> Prohibit the removal of a child eligible for adoption from foster parents who are willing to adopt, except when the child is being returned to his legal parents. Enact legislation to permit foster parents to initiate adoption proceedings.
<P>
<LI> Enact laws requiring child welfare agencies to initiate adoption proceedings for any child who has been abandoned by his parents for six months.
</ul><P>

	Adoption works. It increases the emotional, physical, and cognitive capacities of the children who are adopted. It improves the life chances of the biological mother. It saves vast amounts of money for the public. It brings much happiness, both to the adopting parents and to the adopted child. It is good for all involved.
<p>
	The current welfare reform debate in Congress offers one of the best chances in decades to promote adoption. Sharply rising out-of-wedlock births add steadily to the long-range costs of welfare, because being born out of wedlock significantly increases the chances of ending up on welfare. At the same time, up to two million couples waiting to adopt frequently find themselves hamstrung by government agencies and government practices.

<P>
<b>THE NEED FOR ADOPTION</b>
<p>
	Over the past 25 years there has been a dramatic increase in the numbers of children born out of wedlock, children being raised by single parents, families on welfare, and children entering the foster care system because of abuse and neglect. Family disintegration is widespread. There also has been a sharp decrease in the number of children being adopted, with formal adoptions dropping by almost 50 percent:  from 89,000 in 1970 to a fairly constant 50,000 annually throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s.4<p>	The National Council for Adoption estimates that of the 50,000 children adopted annually, 25,000 are healthy children under age two, 10,000 are healthy children over age two, and 15,000 are children with "special needs" (the social work term of art for children considered difficult to place because of their age, physical or mental condition, race or ethnicity, or need to be placed with siblings).5  About one-third of these adoptions are arranged by government-funded and government-managed public agencies, some by contract with private agencies. Another one-third are arranged by private, mostly nonprofit agencies, and the rest are contracted outside of agency auspices, mostly through lawyers in private practice. International adoptions accounted for an additional 8,000 adoptions during 1994.
<p>
	Adoption fell out of favor among social workers during the 1970s, even as single parenthood and abortion became more widespread. Advocates of government-sponsored social programs argued that increases in welfare would make it possible for unmarried mothers to rear children without the assistance of a father.6  Yet, as is evident from the skyrocketing foster care numbers7 and from the chronic problems associated with the absence of fathers, such as crime, poor school performance, poor health status, and low income,8 that view has turned out to be a tragic mistake. By contrast, children adopted by two parents are doing as well as their peers raised in their own intact families.9<p><b>PATTERNS OF PARENTAL NEGLECT </b><p>	The rapid increase of illegitimacy and the staggering problems of children born out of wedlock and raised without fathers are well documented.10<p><ul><li>In 1991, 29.5 percent of all births and 68 percent of minority births were out of wedlock.11  In 1970, 10.7 percent of all children and 37.6 percent of minority children were born to unmarried mothers.12<p><li>In 1986, 66 percent of unintended pregnancies ended in abortion and 33 percent ended with a woman choosing to be a single parent. Only 1 percent ended in adoption.13<p><li>In 1992, 659,000 children were in state-sponsored foster care and institutional care for all or part of the year. On any given day, half a million American children live in government-sponsored substitute care.14<p><li>In 1982, 7,100 infants were in substitute care outside their homes; in 1988, there were over 17,000.<p><li>In 1991, 2,000 children died from abuse or neglect. Some were murdered. Between 30-50 percent of children killed by their parents or caretakers were known to child protective services before their murders took place.15</ul><p>	There has been a sharp increase in the number of infants abandoned by their frequently drug-addicted mothers. According to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), 12,000 infants were abandoned in 199
1.16  In response to this crisis, there has been a proliferation of "boarder baby"17 homes to care for these children until their parents can be located and rehabilitated. A 1993 General Accounting Office report showed that 10,000 infants were being boarded in hospitals for no medical reason. Less than 40 percent of the boarder babies -- and none of the abandoned babies -- were expected to leave in the care of their parents.
<P>
	The average total cost of caring for these babies in hospital after their medical treatment is almost $13,000.18  Nonetheless, only 2.5 percent of the boarder babies and 6 percent of the abandoned infants were expected to go into adoptive placements.19  The vast majority of these children will spend years in and out of the foster care system while the biological mother attempts to get her life together.20<P>	Federal efforts to deal with this have been small and swamped by the size of the problem.21  When Representative Harris Fawell (R-IL) introduced the At-Birth Abandoned Infants Act (H.R. 2936) last year to help move abandoned babies out of the system and into permanent adoptive homes, the child welfare establishment lobbied against it, arguing that creating a two-tiered system -- a fast track for new-born abandoned babies and a slower, less responsive one for older children -- was unfair.22  The bill was not enacted.<P><b>WHY ADOPTION SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED</b><P><b>Benefits for Children</b><P>	Adopted children do as well as or better than their non-adopted counterparts, according to a 1994 study by the Search Institute, a Minneapolis-based public policy research organization specializing in questions of concern to states and cities.23  This study, the largest examination of adopted adolescents yet undertaken, concludes that:

<LI>Teens who were adopted at birth are more likely than children born into intact families to live with two parents in a middle-class family.24<P><LI>Adopted children score higher than their middle-class counterparts on indicators of school performance, social competency, optimism, and volunteerism.25<P><LI>Adopted adolescents generally are less depressed than children of single parents and less involved in alcohol abuse, vandalism, group fighting, police trouble, weapon use, and theft.26<P><LI>Adopted adolescents score higher than children of single parents on self-esteem, confidence in their own judgment, self-directedness, positive view of others, and feelings of security within their families.27<P><LI>On health measures, adopted children and children of intact families share similarly high scores, and both those groups score significantly higher than children raised by single parents.28<P><LI>Adopted children do well at school. In 1981, only 7 percent of children adopted in infancy repeated a grade, while 12 percent of children living with both biological parents repeated a grade.29<P><LI>Compared with the general child population, children placed with adoptive couples are better off economically. Their parents are better educated and older than the parents of other children.30<p><LI>Adoptive parents are less likely to divorce.31<P></ul>	Virtually all of these findings have been replicated by Nicholas Zill, Vice President and Director of Child and Family Studies at Westat Research Corporation of Maryland, in his analysis of data from the federal government's 1988 National Health Interview Survey on Child Health.32  Results from the survey were compared across four groups:  adopted children, children of unmarried mothers being raised by the mother, children of intact families, and children being raised by their grandparents.

<b>Benefits for Mothers Who Give Up Children for Adoption</b>
<p>
<li>	Significantly, teenage mothers who choose adoption also do better than mothers who choose to be single parents.
<p>
<LI>They have higher educational aspirations, are more likely to finish school, and less likely to live in poverty and receive public assistance than mothers who keep their children.
<p>
<li>They delay marriage longer and are more likely to marry eventually.
<p>
<li>They are more likely to be employed 12 months after the birth and less likely to repeat out-of-wedlock pregnancy.
<P>
<li>They are no more likely to suffer negative psychological consequences, such as depression, than are mothers who rear children as single parents.36</ul><p>All the goals of liberal government programs like job training, supplemental education, and family planning are attained with greater ease, and at lower cost, through adoption.37<p><b>HOW MANY POTENTIAL PARENTS ARE THERE?</b><p>	Although growing numbers of children need adoption, there are more than enough families to meet the demand. The National Council for Adoption estimates that at least one million infertile couples and an additional one million fertile couples would like to adopt.38<P>	Couples who want to adopt are not looking just for healthy, Caucasian infants, despite assumptions to the contrary. The National Down's Syndrome Adoption Exchange reports a waiting list of over 100 couples who would like to adopt a child with Down's syndrome -- more than enough to accomodate parents who want Down's children given up for adoption. Nor is it difficult to find families for children with spina bifida and children who are HIV positive. For example, the National Council for Adoption is identifying children who will be orphaned when their parents die of AIDS, so that appropriate plans can be made before the parents' death. The response by individuals and families willing to adopt such children has been overwhelming.
<p>
	Americans are also willing to help with children from overseas, especially because of the anti-adoption bias in the United States. When the communist regime in Romania fell, ABC-TV's "20/20" reported that thousands of children were warehoused in government orphanages. Pictures showed many children with health and developmental problems. ABC received over 25,000 self-addressed, stamped envelopes from people who wanted more information, and within six months 2,000 Romanian children were adopted by Americans,39 many of whom had not considered adoption until this need became known. This suggests that the pool of parents willing to adopt could be expanded signficantly.
<p>
	In 1993, over 56 percent of the 7,348 children from other countries adopted by American parents were over the age of one. Of these, 9 percent were between the ages of five and nine, and 5 percent were over the age of ten.40  In addition, many of these foreign-born children have physical and emotional problems at the time of their adoption.41<p>	Despite the evident readiness and desire to adopt, many families report a lack of support or encouragement from the social services establishment. They report such things as unanswered phone calls, inadequate networking with other agencies which may have children ready for adoption, a disinclination to identify children with needs that correspond to the gifts of the family, and a general lack of support to bring couples successfully through the adoption process.42<p> <b>THE BARRIERS TO ADOPTION</b><p>	Although adoption meets the interests of the needy child better than any other option, Elizabeth Bartholet of Harvard Law School concludes that "our adoption system has failed to live up to even its own limited vision.... Laws and policies that are supposed to protect children have created barriers to adoption that function effectively to prevent these children from getting the kind of protection they most need 'a loving, nurturing and permanent home.'"43<P>	The legal system often resolves cases in ways that trouble many Americans. In two widely publicized recent cases, for example, children were wrested from their adoptive parents on the basis of biological ties. Baby Jessica was given to her biological father, who had failed to support two previous children, and Baby Richard was given to his biological father, with whom he had never lived, instead of being allowed to remain with the adoptive family which had nurtured him from birth for three years. In both cases, the overriding "biological ties" of the fathers prevailed over the needs of their children.
<P>
	Several barriers make it very difficult for many families to adopt children.
<P>
<B>BARRIER #1:  Anti-Adoption Bias in Pregnancy Counseling</B>
<P>
Only 1 percent of women who experience an "unwanted pregnancy" choose adoption for their children.44  A University of Illinois study explains some of the causes:<P><UL><LI>Some 40 percent of individuals in a variety of settings (health, family planning, social services, and adoption agencies) who identify themselves as "pregnancy counselors" do not even raise the issue of adoption with pregnant clients.<p><LI>An additional 40 percent provide inaccurate or incomplete information to clients.
<p>
<LI>By contrast, 38 percent of the clients whose counselors offered adoption went on to choose adoption.45<p></ul>	Congress's efforts to require adoption information and counseling in one federally funded program providing services to pregnant women have met with resistance from family planning professionals. For instance, the Adolescent Family Life Act46 was passed in the early 1980s to provide a modest ($7.8 million), more "pro-life," adoption-friendly alternative to the pregnancy counseling provided by established Title X and Title XIX family planning services (typically over $300 million per year). The bias among professionals against adoption can be seen in the evaluation of the program's effectiveness. Some 7 percent of the grantees violated the most basic terms of their grants by not providing any information on adoption to their clients. Most grantees failed to provide either adequate adoption information or counseling.47<P><B>BARRIER #2:  Misuse of the Foster Care System</B>
<P>
	In 1980, Congress enacted P.L. 96-272, the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act. This legislation sought to provide permanent homes for children at risk of abuse and neglect by establishing a hierarchy of services for these children and for their families. In order of priority, these services were:
<P><ol>
<li>Family preservation;<p>

<li>Short-term foster care with a goal of family reunification; and<P>

<li>Long-term foster care or adoption.<p>
</ol><p>
	This legislation requires that each child's situation be reviewed every six months. Within 18 months of opening every case, a permanent plan for the child's future must be in place. This placement plan embodies a decision by the child welfare agency as to whether the child will be returned to the family or placed for adoption. Such decisions and plans must be in place before the work of clearing the child for adoption can be undertaken. Only after both steps have been taken can the search for adoptive parents begin.
<p>
	During the 1980s, these permanency planning guidelines evolved into the operating principle of "family preservation" -- keeping families intact through early, intense, comprehensive social services. The goal was to keep families united and thus avoid the high costs of foster care.
<P>
	Because of their own high costs, however, family preservation services cannot be sustained for long periods; and because of high demand, caseworkers move quickly to take care of the next family in crisis. This approach did succeed in stopping the removal of children from the home, but not necessarily in preserving them from further abuse.48  In fact, there is evidence that children fare worse under these new practices. In New York City alone, during the 12 months of 1992, 21 children were killed by a parent or mother's boyfriend after the Child Welfare Administration had intervened.49<P>	A study by John Schuerman and his colleagues at the University of Chicago found that the "Family First" program did not realize even its central goal:  preventing the removal of children.50  Neither did it protect children from further abuse. There is evidence that some families continue to abuse their children even during the period of intensive state intervention.51  By contrast, there is strong evidence that children do better when left in foster care than when they are returned to abusive families.52  This evidence leads to a simple and commonsense conclusion:  children need a permanent home to which they can belong. For children at serious risk, an adoptive home is their best chance for real permanence.
<P>
	Some child advocates challenge the principle of applying the "family preservation" approach in all cases. At a 1994 conference sponsored by the National Council for Adoption at Boys Town, Nebraska, Dr. Richard Gelles of the University of Rhode Island, a pre-eminent child abuse researcher and an early and optimistic supporter of family preservation programs, presented the following paraphrased views on these practices in light of recent evaluation data:
<P><blockquote>

	There are a now a number of studies of children who were returned home only to be abused again or even killed. These studies show dramatically that some abusive parents cannot be rehabilitated.53  In these cases the appropriate care of such a child is to terminate the parents' rights as quickly as possible and place the child with a permanent caring adoptive family.</blockquote><p>		The Boys Town conference highlighted the central problem of family preservation services. The first logical step should be to assess whether the child should be removed immediately and whether the parents are likely to benefit from support services. Instead, family preservation services are assumed to be the best first treatment. Though these services are activated because of abuse to the child -- sometimes very severe abuse -- they must fail before the child can be protected from the abusing family.<P>

	The foster care system is the aggregate network of parents who work for state and local social service agencies by taking abandoned, abused, or neglected children into their homes. They receive a set amount each month with which to feed, clothe, and nurture these children. Foster parents try to function as substitute parents. Prudently, they are admonished not to expect that placement will be permanent. However, from among the couples who take on this work come many who would like to adopt, particularly as they get to know these children and their lack of prospects for a happy and safe life in their families of origin.
<P>
	Government funding reinforces an anti-adoption bias by supporting "family preservation" programs with free technical assistance and generous grants while providing only restricted support for adoption. The National Council for Adoption and the Institute for Justice report that numerous families, including foster families, have had their attempts to adopt waiting children rebuffed by the social service agencies for whom they work.54  Conna Craig of the Institute for Children in Boston reports receiving hundreds of letters from foster parents who are willing and able to adopt their foster children, some of whom have been eligible for years.
<P>
<B>BARRIER #3:  Overload and Confusion of Social Service Roles</B>
<P>
	According to Douglas J. Besharov of the American Enterprise Institute, the rising incidence of reported child abuse keeps local child welfare agencies extremely busy on policing activities, diverting time and resources from adoption.55  Often the same staff must investigate abuse reports, provide family preservation services, file for the termination of parental rights, and recruit and prepare adoptive families.
<P>
	The child welfare system typically does not separate the responsibility for terminating parental rights of parents who continue to abuse and neglect their children from the responsibility to help those parents who can be helped. Deaths of children result, as in the cases of the 21 who died in New York in 1992. By contrast, in Arizona and Oregon, separate professional units are used to make initial determinations and to justify the necessary court proceedings. Professionals are not trapped in the role confusion caused by simultaneous demands to reunite every family while also protecting the child.
<P>
	If units like those in Arizona and Oregon were in general use, a number of benefits would result:
<P><UL>
<LI>Courts could separate those children more decisively and quickly from parents unlikely to reform or benefit from family preservation services.<P>

<LI>Children in danger of severe abuse would be separated more quickly and expertly from their families and made available for adoption.<P>

<LI>Social workers involved in helping the more tractable parents would be free to pursue that work with much less likelihood of endangering the child.<P>

<LI>Local government agencies could turn to the adoption services of nonprofit agencies much more quickly and frequently. Private agencies do not have the immense burden of child protective services and related policing requirements that public agencies have. Their mission is to recruit and prepare adoptive families, and they tend to have great expertise in this work.<P>
</ul><p>
<b>BARRIER #4:  Unsatisfactory Protection of Confidentiality</b>
<P>
	State adoption laws generally guarantee the confidentiality of the identity of the mother, the inviolability of the internal intimacy and harmony of the adoptive family, and the peaceful development of the adopted child.
<P>
	In adoption law and philosophy, there has arisen a view which parallels the modern revisionist view of marriage and parenthood embodied in "no-fault" divorce. New relationships between parent and child are imagined, and a new type of contract is forged between parents. Open adoption is akin to no-fault divorce, and the "birth parents" take on the role of the visiting parent who has not yielded up all his rights to the child, particularly rights of visitation and vacations together. The adoptive parents are bound not just to their adopted child, but also to the birth parents and must facilitate the continuing relationship between the child and his birth parents. This form of open adoption exists in Oregon from birth and in Indiana for children over two years of age.
<P>
	Open adoption provides no seal of confidentiality regarding the identity of the birth parents, the adopting parents, and the child. It essentially blends birth families with adopting families, directly undermining the creation of a permanent new family for a child. The professional literature shows a frequent confusion of roles when the birth family continues a relationship with the child. This also interferes with parent and child bonding56 in the adoptive family and inhibits the birth parents' grieving process.57  There are parallel experiences and research findings with respect to divorce and the increased risks of being raised in blended families.58Confidentiality, especially in infant adoptions, helps minimize these risks.<P>	Oregon is an example of a state in which open adoption allows birth parents to take adoptive parents to court to uphold visitation agreements. This policy undermines the rights of adoptive parents to make parenting decisions. It also changes the nature and dynamics of a close, intact, inviolably intimate adoptive family, exposing it to the disruptions, conflicts, and anxieties characteristic of divorced and blended families. The professional literature on childhood emotional and behavioral development shows that children of blended families do less well than children of single parents and intact families.59  If successful, the growing push for open adoption60 could cause similar difficulties for adopted children, undermining the generally strong mental health reported by the Search Institute and Nicholas Zill.61<P>	Proponents of open adoption even recommend abolishing adoption in favor of "guardianship," which does not offer the same permanency of family for the child.62  Like any other government policy which treats the adoptive families differently from intact families, this undermines the very essence of adoption.
<P>
	Understandably, many children become interested in knowing about their birth parents as they reach early adulthood. Their desire may be fulfilled if everyone involved is prepared to cooperate in lifting the veil of confidentiality. Most states try to maintain confidentiality if there is not full agreement among all concerned. Others do not. Two, Alaska and Kansas, will release the original birth certificate with the names of the biological parents to the adopted person after the age of eighteen, regardless of the birth mother's desires.63<P>	Proponents of opening adoption records seek legislation at the federal level. Senator Carl Levin (D-MI) has introduced various versions of a "national reunion registry" to help connect birth parents with persons who are adopted. The National Council for Adoption and many of its affiliated private adoption agencies have challenged the vagueness of the legislative proposals which do not assure confidentiality. They also have questioned the need to federalize a state issue.
<P>
<b>BARRIER #5:  Unknown, Uninvolved, or Unmarried Fathers</b>

<P>	Another major barrier for unmarried women considering adoption for their children is the need to obtain the consent of uninvolved fathers. Fortunately the Supreme Court, in a series of opinions,64 has clarified and restricted the rights of uninvolved, unmarried fathers. According to current federal law, these rights correspond to the effort the father has made to establish a relationship with his child. The unmarried father who is unknown, is uninvolved, or has otherwise demonstrated no responsibility or interest in the child may not be entitled to the same consideration as an involved and responsible unmarried father. Federal courts have ruled consistently65 that ignorance of a pregnancy is no excuse for uninvolvement, because the father was present at conception and could have followed through to assure adequate care for the child. <P>	 A growing trend in state legislatures, upheld by the Supreme Court in Lehr v. Robertson,66 is the establishment of father registries which make the father responsible for asserting his parental rights. The registry usually requires the father to file a paternity action within 30 days of the child's birth. This will result in his being notified of a pending adoption. He then will have an opportunity to demonstrate that he has tried to establish a relationship with the child and to take responsibility for the child's care. If he fails to meet any of these requirements, he forfeits his rights to contest the adoption of the child, and the adoption can proceed. While many conservatives think an absent unmarried father should never be an obstacle to adoption, this procedure at least frees the mothers to place children without registered fathers for adoption.

<P>	The House welfare bill requires paternity establishment at birth for all fathers. This is a major step in the right direction. Fears that efforts to locate unknown, unmarried fathers will slow down, and possibly stop, adoption are unfounded. If the mother is not seeking AFDC support (and she will not if she is placing her child for adoption), she will not need to identify the father. Simultaneously, the putative father registry protects the due process rights of all fathers. Those who do not register, however, cannot benefit from the protection it would have given them.
<P>
<b>BARRIER #6:  Race of the Child and Adoptive Parents</b>
<P>
	Two forms of racial discrimination take place within adoption:  against adoptive parents and against children waiting to be adopted. Potential black parents lose the chance to give their love to needy children of their own race. Black children in foster care are deprived of new parents and a stronger foundation in life, in addition to being exposed to the risks of retarded social and intellectual development. Both forms of discrimination must be eliminated. Fortunately, the means to accomplish this already exist within the private sector. There is no need for coercive race-matching legislation.
<P>
<B>THE SPECIAL PLIGHT OF BLACK CHILDREN</B>

<P>	There are more black children waiting in foster care than there are prescreened black families ready to adopt them. With the need for permanent adoptive homes growing more acute and the exit rate from foster care slowing continually, the likelihood of multiple placements for black children increases.67  Indeed, some 24 percent of the children in foster care today have been in three or four different homes.68  According to Ira Schwartz of the University of Michigan, 53 percent of all children in Michigan who entered the foster care system as newborns are still in foster care at age four.69  A number of regional studies confirm this trend and demonstrate that black children typically wait two to three years longer than white children for adoptive homes.70<P>	The length of stay in foster care is very important. The longer the newborn stays in foster care, the more at risk he is of approaching the "difficult to adopt" age and the greater the problems associated with long-term foster care become. If half the children who arrive in foster care at birth are still in it at age four, the system is not serving their needs.
<P>
	This statistic highlights the need for termination units -- specialized units of social workers who work with the courts to determine whether the parental rights of an abusing or neglectful parent should be withdrawn so that the child may be placed for adoption. If the "best interest of the child" principle is used, this decision will be made quickly. If the "family preservation" principle is used, the decision will be delayed again and again, often until repeated neglect convinces the authorities that parental rights must be removed. At this point, in addition to having suffered even more, the child is older and more difficult to place.
<P>
	Given these figures, public welfare agencies are a major source of neglect of young black children. The bias against adopting early, when the child is most adoptable, feeds the foster care system and ensures a larger clientele for public agencies. The present system of financing foster care and not financing adoptions perversely rewards this form of government neglect.

<P>
<b>Black Families and Adoption</b>
<P>
	There is evidence that blacks adopt at a much higher rate than whites if one controls for family structure, income, and age of parents.71  A 1983 Department of Health and Human Services study72 put these comparable rates at:<P><UL><LI>7 adoptions per 10,000 black families for all black families;<P><LI>2 adoptions per 10,000 white families for all white families; and
<P>
<LI>2 adoptions per 10,000 Hispanic families for all Hispanic families.<P></ul>

Controlling for age of parents (below 55), family income (above poverty level), and family structure (intact families), the rates change to:<P>

<LI>18 adoptions per 10,000 black families within the range;<P>

<LI>4 adoptions per 10,000 white families within the range; and<P>

<LI>3 adoptions per 10,000 Hispanic families within the range.<P>

	These figures convey the reality of much higher adoption rates among blacks than among whites or Hispanics for children in public welfare agencies who are available for adoption.73<P>	To meet the needs of all children within their own racial communities by placing them in couple-headed families above poverty, the same study suggests that the response rate among black families would have to be far higher than it is. It would need to approach 44 per 10,000 families for blacks, compared with 6 per 10,000 families for whites and 6 per 10,000 families for Hispanics. This would require an enormous increase in the rates of adoption by blacks and Hispanics. Richard Barth of the School of Social Welfare at the University of California at Berkeley sums up the conclusions to which these data lead:
<P><blockquote>
	The growth of African-American adoptions have increased by 92% in the last 5 years and Hispanic adoptions by 80%. The growth of African American adoptions would have to grow four times faster than that during the next five years in order to give African American children parity of access to adoption. For Hispanic children, the growth rate would have to double for their opportunity to be adopted to reach parity with Caucasian children.74</blockquote><P>	To achieve these levels of adoption will require a great community effort by black and Hispanic people.<P>	As well-run private agencies demonstrate, large pools of adoptive parents can be developed over time. Even pools of parents for "harder to place children" can be developed when the effort is made by a committed organization. For instance, Down's syndrome children are adopted quite quickly because there is a network of screened parents in place and ready to adopt. Similarly, a pool of parents ready to adopt HIV-positive babies has been developed by the National Council for Adoption.
<P>
	In a 1980 study of black parents, sociology professor Robert Hill of the Institute for Urban Research at Morgan State University estimated that three million black households are interested in adopting children. This translates into one hundred black families for every black child in foster care waiting for adoption.75  Given this potential, a pool of prescreened adoptive parents big enough to take care of the needs of black children represents an achievable goal.<P>	The private sector can best develop this pool because private organizations are motivated to do so. Building pools of parents is not the strong suit of public agencies.76  Some private organizations in the black community have achieved remarkable results. Recently, for instance, in just one year, Detroit's Homes for Black Children placed 132 children in black homes -- more than all the other 13 child welfare agencies in the city.77  To increase the rate of adoption within black families, the leadership of the black community should commit itself strongly to using private organizations.<P>	Although the emphasis should be on making it easier for black families to adopt, blocking transracial adoptions just because the children are black and the parents are white discriminates against many needy black children because of race. Moreover, it does not increase the rate of in-race adoption. California, despite a law requiring a 90-day search for a same-race family before a child can be adopted across racial lines, still has twice as many black children as white children waiting for adoption, often for long periods.78<P>	The Institute for Justice recently filed suit on behalf of a white foster couple who had cared for a black child since birth. When the child became eligible, they sought to adopt him but were blocked by the public welfare agency because they were not black. Even when black parents were not found, the agency persisted in blocking this adoption. No one can argue that this was in the best interest of the child.79  Similar racial discrim
ination prevented the adoption of a white child by a black couple who had fostered the child since birth. <P>	 In 1984, liberal black columnist Carl T. Rowan argued against the "abominable notion that race must be the dominant factor in deciding who can deliver loving care and protection to a child."  Rowan equated the position of black social workers who support only in-race adoption with a 1954 statement by a segregationist Mississippi editor that "every child has the right to be educated among children and by teachers of the same racial background."80  Furthermore, according to professor Rita Simon, sociologist at the American University and expert in transracial adoption, "The data in our studies and indeed in all the studies that have been done show that transracial adoptions serve the children's best interests."81<P>	Still, opposition to transracial adoption is strong. When former Senator Howard Metzenbaum (D-OH) steered S. 1224 through Congress in 1993, he did so to outlaw obstacles similar to the above restrictions that exist in most states. But the Clinton Administration, which supports race matching, succeeded in changing the legislation so that lack of race matching could be used to deny or delay a placement.82  Instead of encouraging solutions, such as private adoption agencies that specialize in placing black children, the Administration's policy aggravates the problem.<P>	The Bunning Amendment, now incorporated into the House-passed welfare bill, repeals the Clinton policy. Senator John McCain (R-AZ) has a similar amendment (S. 637) to the Senate version of the welfare reform bill. The Children's Defense Fund supported the Clinton Administration's approach,83 despite the evidence of researchers such as Rita Simon, who shows that transracial adoption does not damage the child emotionally or developmentally and that transracially adopted children do just as well as those adopted by parents of their own race.84<P>	Race matching can be achieved easily if there are enough prescreened adoptive p
arents. The difficulty lies not in the lack of parents but in the poor track record of public agencies in building a pool of black adoptive parents.<P><B> NEED FOR FEDERAL LEADERSHIP</B><P>	A child's needs are best served, and his potential fostered most effectively, by the love and sense of belonging provided by a stable family environment. As in other areas of social concern, however, the government's ability to increase love and dedication is limited. This competence resides primarily with the family, the church, and the school. However, through their power to enact wiser laws and provide leadership, lawmakers at the federal level can affect the rate of adoption. They can expound upon its benefits for the child, for the mother who gave birth, and for the parents who adopt.
<P>
	Adoption is one of those rare good solutions to many thorny problems. Political leaders should help the country realize that it is one of the most effective ways to alleviate the problems arising from illegitimacy, child abuse, and neglect.
<P>
Lawmakers also must challenge the leaders of other major institutions, especially church leaders, to talk about the goodness of adoption. Educational leaders, particularly in social studies areas, ought to be challenged to develop good materials on adoption. Health insurance leaders ought to be challenged as well, for adoption is a less costly solution to infertility than is fertility treatment, which averages about $35,000 per course of treatment. Media leaders ought to harness their expertise in communications to promote adoption to the nation at large, instead of attacking it.85<P>	The more this is done, the more attractive adoption will be to growing numbers of families. America also needs to celebrate parents who adopt and parents who care for foster children -- especially those who both foster and adopt. They show a double generosity.
<P>
	Adoption is a national resource that should be encouraged and expanded by government where possible. The federal government should undertake a public relations campaign, targeted to girls under the age of 18 who have conceived out of wedlock, on the benefits of adoption. In addition, Congress should:
<P>
<b>1.) Enact a means-tested, fully refundable, inflation-adjusted tax credit of up to $5,000 for non-recurring adoption expenses.</B>
<P>

	The House-passed tax bill (H.R. 1215) provides a non-refundable tax credit of up to $5,000 for adoption costs for those with incomes up to $60,000, gradually phased out for those with incomes between $60,000 and $100,000.
<P>
	Congress permits a tax deduction for the medical costs of fertility treatment (typically between $35,000 and $50,000 for testing, test tube conception, and deep freeze, development, and discard). The average revenue loss for such treatment is about $8,000. Some corporate health plans, the costs of which are fully excludable from employees' taxable income, also cover fertility treatment. By contrast, the Treasury would gain financially from a one-time $5,000 tax credit that encouraged parents to assume the total cost of caring for foster children -- each of whom now costs taxpayers over $13,000 each year.86<P>	This tax credit should be fully refundable (including against Social Security taxes) so that poorer parents who adopt a child receive the same level of support as those who earn more and have larger tax liabilities. The object is to encourage and support those who want to adopt. Being less generous with poorer parents (and more black parents are poor compared to white parents) is unwise because it reduces the incentive to adopt.
<P>
<b>2)  Hold hearings on the Clinton Administration's blocking of an effective drug testing and treatment program for cocaine-addicted pregnant mothers. If necessary, pass legislation to reverse the Administration's action.</b>
<P>
	The high incidence of serious child abuse among drug-addicted mothers inflicts pain and damage on cocaine-addicted babies. With some 350,000 children affected each year, there is an obvious need for a change in federal law to permit the testing of mothers suspected of cocaine addiction. These babies are at high risk for foster care and for severe damage to their health and development.
<P>
	South Carolina Attorney General Charles Molony Condon ran a successful program of testing, mandated treatment, or a jail sentence if the mother refused treatment. The result was dramatic:  the incidence of cocaine-addicted mothers fell from 24 per month in Charleston to five or six per month.87  The Clinton Administration, however, called the program punitive and racially discriminatory and threatened to cut off all federal reimbursements to the hospital involved, effectively threatening to shut down the program and discouraging other states interested in replicating the Charleston model.
<P>
	Congress should take steps to reverse this Administration policy. The use of cocaine by pregnant women is a major factor in the death or severe damaging of many thousands of cocaine-affected newborns.
<P>
<b>3) Issue annual report cards on the rate of adoption in each state.</b>
<P>
	To redress the poor quality of national data on adoption and foster care, Congress should instruct the Department of Health and Human Services to issue comparative report cards on the performance of each state in a number of areas concerning the family condition of children, including:
<P><ul>
<LI>The number and rate of out-of-wedlock births,<P>

<LI>The rate of adoption,<P>

<LI>The length of stay in foster care, including information on the longest stays,<P>

<LI>The typical period between the availability of a child for adoption and the child's adoption, and<P>

<LI>The typical period between the beginning of foster care and the agency's finalization of a placement plan (decision regarding the future of the child).</ul><P>

	Dissemination of such information will keep state residents better informed and help encourage agencies to find children good, permanent homes.
<P>
<B>4)  Require hospitals and clinics receiving federal funds for family planning services to provide clear and accurate information on the benefits of adoption to all out-of-wedlock teenage mothers.</b>
<P>
	Congress should require HHS to contract with pro-adoption experts for the writing and distribution of an appropriate brochure on the benefits of adoption for both mother and child. Congress then should require that this brochure be distributed in all hospitals which receive federal funding, either directly or indirectly, and in all federally funded family planning clinics, and that the staff of such hospitals and clinics draw attention to this material.
<P>
<B>5)  Make it easy for all churches, particularly black churches that serve the poor, to affiliate with adoption agencies and become involved in the adoption process as outreach to prospective adopting parents.</b>
<P>
	One of the best ways the federal government can help these churches is by providing an incentive for members to adopt more children waiting in foster care. The full refundability of the $5,000 tax credit will do much to effect this. Unless their members are able to pay most of the normal costs of adoption, there is little likelihood that black churches in poor neighborhoods will be involved. With the tax credit and with church involvement, however, the probability of an increase in adoption is significantly greater.
<P>
<B>6)  Ensure the civil rights of all children in foster care and modify the Multi-Ethnic Placement Act to prohibit clearly the use or consideration of race or ethnicity in denying or delaying the placement of a child for foster care or adoption.</B>
<P>
	The fundamental principle behind all civil rights is equality of rights and equal treatment under law. A young child without a family cries out for as quick a placing as possible within a caring family, so that his long-term human potential may not be thwarted at critical early stages of development. The "personness" of that child is infinitely more important than his or her "blackness," "Indianness," "Hispanicness," or "Asianness."  In cases where parents of similar ethnic background are unavailable within, say, a 90-day period, then those who are available and willing to adopt should be united with the child, both for the child's benefit and for the good of society.
<P>
	Those who are anxious to have the children of a community adopted within that community must ensure a sufficient supply of parents wanting to adopt. The onus is on the community and ought not to be placed on the waiting child. To help assure a pool of parents, Congress should work with states to streamline and simplify adoption procedures in minority communities.
<P>
	Many opportunities for developing a pool of waiting parents are available. The network of minority churches is extensive. By linking with private adoption agencies, these churches can help respond to the needs of minority children awaiting adoption. Many other ethnic organizations can be harnessed to bring the pool of minority adopting parents up to the level needed. The press could carry public service announce-ments in minority communities. Minority fraternities and sororities also could play an important role. These and similar community efforts would raise public consciousness about adoption.
<P>
<B>7)  Change the Indian Child Welfare Act to curtail the reach of Indian Nation law over those who have emigrated from those communities and societies.</B>
<P>
	While fully respecting the right of Indian nations to regulate adoptions within their territories, and while fully respecting the rights of all Indian parents giving up their children for adoption to request that the Indian nations take these children for adoption, Congress ought to change civil rights law so that the rights of Indian or part-Indian parents living outside the nations' territories are upheld.
<P>
	Under current law, a child with as little as one sixty-fourth Indian ancestry may be under the control of that Indian tribe for adoption, no matter where the child lives. While the number may be modest, the principle of "personness" again is paramount. Just as a foreign-born American citizen is not subject to the adoption laws of his country of origin, an Indian who has chosen freely to leave the Indian nation and to marry someone outside it should no longer be subject to its laws.
<P>
<B>8)  Reject the language in the U.N. Charter on the Rights of the Child. </B>

<P>	This charter could preclude adoptions for millions of children over time and deny U.S. couples the option of adopting foreign children. The unsigned U.N. Charter on the Rights of the Child may come before Congress in the near future for ratification. In the current draft, international adoption is declared to be a last option, after the home country has exhausted its search.
<P>
	As in cases of transracial and race-matching adoption, each nation has a responsibility to assemble a pool of prescreened adoptive parents if it has children waiting to be adopted. If a nation does not have such a pool, and yet blocks couples from abroad from adopting, that nation is neglecting its children. The United States should be on the side of the child rather than on the side of governments that seek international acceptance of some specious "right" to neglect their nation's children.
<P>
	If the language of the U.N. Charter on the Rights of the Child is accepted by Congress, it could mean an end to most international adoptions. The Hague Convention, to which the United States is a signatory, and which guides present policies, is superior though far from sufficient. Its guiding principle is that care in a family is better for a child than care in an institution.
<P>
<B>WHAT THE STATES SHOULD DO</B>
<P>
	Because regulating adoption is a state function, most of the practical reforms must be enacted by state legislatures. And because of the particular need to address the transracial adoption issue in a just and caring fashion, the states must take special care to eliminate discrimination against black adoptive parents and black children.
<P>
	To increase the pool of available parents to fill the needs of all children, states should encourage the privatization of adoption. Specialized agencies can work constructively with those sections of the community that are willing to serve the many different needs of children:  black children, older children, children with special medical problems, and children with other emotional or developmental difficulties. As different groups already have demonstrated, it is possible to line up a pool of screened and qualified parents more than willing to adopt children with even the most difficult needs.
<P>
	One effort, started by Fr. George Clements in Chicago in the mid-1980s, had each church set about achieving the adoption of one child within the congregation.88  Though initially the program received wide publicity and had some impact, it has not become a sustained and organized national effort. However, in Florida, One Church, One Child of Florida has developed a successful partnership between church and state. Between March 1988 and September 1990, this organization placed 805 black children in adoption.89<P>	Phoebe Dawson, a social worker who heads New Beginnings, a licensed nonprofit adoption agency in Columbus, Georgia, has been very successful in this work. For instance, an agency in Cleveland, Ohio, was not able to find minority parents for a young minority child, leaving the child at serious risk of a protracted wait for adoption. One worker at the agency contacted New Beginnings, which was able to resolve the problem quickly because of its close ties to black Baptist churches across the country.
<P>
	To encourage adoption, states should:
<P>
<B>1)   Privatize adoption services.</B>
<P>
	Private adoption services are more efficient and more effective than state agencies where adoption is concerned, as illustrated by the track record of Detroit's Homes for Black Children. They are accountable to a board of directors, while state agencies are not. Private organizations may be sued, which increases their accountability to the children and parents they serve. By contrast, state agencies often cannot be sued. Furthermore, people are more inclined to donate money, time, services, and goods to a private adoption agency than to pay taxes for government agencies.
<P>
<B>2)  Change the way public welfare agencies are financed. </B>
<P>
	Public welfare agencies dealing with children receive more money to keep children in foster care than they do to clear them for adoption. States should make the allocation of Title IVE monies to these agencies contingent on their record in making final determinations on the future status of children within 12 months of entering foster care. Those not returning to their families must be adopted within three months or handed over to a private agency for adoption.
<P>
<B>3)  Establish separate units at the county level to assist the courts in making speedy and appropriate judgments. </B>
<P>
	These units should make the initial decision whether to terminate the rights of the parent and bring the process to court or return the child to his family. All babies under 12 months of age coming into the protective custody of a public welfare agency should be processed through the termination unit as a matter of course. A great many such children should be placed for adoption quickly. This in turn would prevent the buildup of a large number of children in foster care -- children who grow more and more difficult to place with each passing year, as the significant drop in the percentage of older children who get adopted clearly indicates.
<P>
<B>4)  Maintain special Medicaid coverage for all special-needs adopted children. </B>
<P>
	This makes it possible for many middle and low-income families to adopt a sick child they would not be able to care for without Medicaid support. It makes sense for government to provide this support, for the special-needs child in foster care will cost the government even more.
<P>
<b>5)  Remove obstacles to transracial adoptions. </B>

<P>	While working to increase the pool of minority parents and to enhance the flow of prequalified and ready-to-adopt minority parents, states should continue the practice of transracial adoption when no same-race parents are available. When the child becomes ready for adoption, his need is immediate and acute. Minority community groups can monitor the pool of prescreened, qualified minority parents for all the relevant categories of children:  older children, older male children, sibling groups of children, medically needy children.
<P>
In addition to the issues involved in ending discrimination against black children waiting to be adopted and against black couples waiting to adopt, there is much else to be done by the states.
<P>
<B>6)  Use leadership opportunities to encourage adoption.</B>
<P>
	Governors and state legislatures should consider mounting campaigns to increase interest in adoption. With the prompting and advocacy of the Institute for Children in Cambridge Massachusetts, the State of Massachusetts, under Governor William Weld's direction, recently embarked upon Assignment Adoption, a series of government reforms to reduce the number of children in foster care and to increase the practice of adoption.
<P>
<B>7)  Establish separate units for termination of the parental rights of convicted abusing parents.</B>
<P>
	When the difficult duty of assessing the appropriateness of terminating parental rights is commingled with the mandate to preserve the family at all costs, the good of the abused child suffers. The long-term good of the child is helped by establishing separate units of social workers who help the court reach clear and speedy decisions regarding the parents' right to continue as parents. These workers can help the courts without the conflict of interest that is present when they also try therapeutically to help the family come together or stay together. It is best that such work be carried on by a different set of professionals. The best interests of the child remain paramount while the effort to help the parent is vigorously pursued.
<P>
<B>8)  Enact a strict 12-month timeline for adjudication of the long-term parental status of every child in foster care.</B>
<P>
	A University of Chicago study finds that children who enter foster care as infants remain in the system 22 percent longer than other young children.90  Within a 12-month period, the court and the termination unit should decide whether a child should be returned to his parents or placed for adoption. Continuance in foster care beyond that time must be regarded by all as a failure to provide properly for the needs of the child. To be lax or negligent in this matter is to be guilty of serious child neglect.
<P>
<B>9)  Centralize the collection of state data on all formal adoptions and foster care actions.</B>

<P>	In order to facilitate the practice of adoption and the reduction of foster care lengths of stay to the minimum time needed, the collection of accurate data is critical. At present it is poor and varies greatly in quality between states. National leaders, national and state campaigns to encourage adoptions, and the stimulation of executive action to initiate and maintain reforms all require an accurate picture of what is happening to children in adoption and foster care. The state Office of Vital Statistics or its equivalent ought to be the repository of all adoption information, and the state Office of Human Services or its equivalent ought to be the repository of all foster care data.
<P>
<B>10) Enact legislation requiring of public social service agencies the same licensing standards and requirements as those now imposed on private adoption agencies.</B>
<P>
	Just as Congress has passed a law (H.R. 1 and S. 2) to subject itself to the same regulations it imposes on the rest of the country, all state agencies involved in adoptions ought to be subject to the same reporting and regulatory oversight as adoption agencies are. This reform will likely have the speedy effect of reducing these regulations to the bare minimum needed for the good of the child.
<P>
<B>11) Mandate drug testing of pregnant mothers suspected of drug abuse, particularly cocaine abuse.</B>
<P>
	Because of the high incidence of serious child abuse among drug-addicted mothers, because of the pain and damage done to cocaine-addicted babies, and because this condition now affects 350,000 children a year, states should push for a federal law permitting the drug testing of mothers suspected of cocaine addiction so that hospitals may participate in such programs without being threatened with a cutoff of federal funds as happened in the South Carolina case discussed above.
<P>
	Children born to drug-addicted mothers are at risk for a host of difficulties and abuses:  lower birth weight, physical abuse, and not getting the affectionate nurturing critical for early attachment formation and its concomitant long-range benefits, among them the formation of a solid conscience and the ability to relate well with others. Given these risks to the child, the requirement of drug testing when cocaine or crack cocaine ingestion is suspected is an appropriate protection.
<P>
<B>12) Prohibit the removal of a child who is eligible for adoption from foster parents who are willing to adopt the child, except when the child is being returned to the legal parents. Enact legislation to permit foster parents to initiate adoption proceedings.</B>
<P>
	If the parents are deemed by the agency as suitable for fostering the child, they should qualify automatically as suitable for adopting the child. Today, many foster parents are willing to adopt the children they have fostered once they become available for adoption. However, mainly because of the effective prohibition of transracial adoptions, these parents frequently are denied the chance to adopt the children who have become attached to them. These couples should have the right to adopt the child once the courts have decided he may be adopted. If child welfare agencies have not made this possible within six months of the court decision, foster parents ought to be granted the standing in law to sue the adoption agency and initiate adoption proceedings.
<P>
<B>13) Enact laws requiring child welfare agencies to initiate adoption proceedings for any child who has been abandoned by his parents for six months.</B>
<P>
	This rule should apply for any child in out-of-home care for six months whose parent has not engaged in meaningful interaction with the child during that period. Due process in the courts will protect the rights of parents barred from contact with their children due to very unusual circumstances. However, a child left alone for six months is a child without a dedicated parent.
<P>
<B>CONCLUSION</B>
<P>
	More and more of the nation's children are at risk of child abuse and neglect as rates of illegitimacy rise. Their plight merits the generous response of dedicated people. Few responses can match the depth and devotion entailed in adopting a child. This dedication reduces a host of problems for the nation:  the costs of extended foster care, the poorer health and slower development of children in foster care or in the home of neglectful and abusing parents, and the higher incidence of addiction, crime, and dependency.
<P>
	Adoption increases the emotional, physical, and cognitive capacities of the children who are adopted. It improves the life chances of the biological mother. It saves vast amounts of money for the taxpayer. It brings much happiness to the adopting parents. It is good for all involved.
<P>
	Adoption works.
<P>
	The current welfare reform debate in Congress offers one of the best chances in decades to promote adoption. Sharply rising out-of-wedlock births add to the long-range costs of welfare, because being born out of wedlock significantly increases the chances of ending up on welfare. As this pool of needy children grows, all too often, up to two million couples waiting to adopt are frustrated in their efforts.
<P>
	The need is great and the solution is obvious:  adoption. Yet government agencies and practices actively discourage this solution which, unlike present policies, could help solve a major national problem while also reducing both welfare dependency and long-range costs. The situation cries out for reform. The suffering of the children cries out for reform.

Marquis and Richard A. Detweiler, "Does Adoption Mean Different?  An Attributional Analysis," Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Vol. 48, No. 4 (1985), pp. 1054-1066. An interesting anomaly has emerged from an analysis of adoption studies. Clinical studies traditionally have shown adopted adolescents to be overrepresented in psychiatric settings. The same occurred here, but these adolescents were found not to have emotional or psychological problems at these rates. Adopted adults are less likely to receive treatment than the general population. This seeming contradiction occurs because adoptive parents are more likely to refer their adopted children for possible treatment. Of all adopted children referred by parents for clinical treatment, only 27 percent had a clinical diagnosis. The remainder -- almost 75 percent -- received counseling for normal adolescent issues.<P>

The fact that the exit numbers of minority children are smaller than those of white children will result in additional increases in the proportion of minority children in care. If current trends continue, minority children will become the clear majority in the nation's substitute care population in the next few years. There already are more minority children than white children in the substitute care systems of several large urban states today.

<p>
National Minority Politics is published monthly by Richberg Communications, Inc.  The magazine and this World Wide Web site are founded on the following principles:<p>
 




<ol>
  <b><li>Strong Families.</b> The foundation of any stable society is -- first and foremost -- strong families in every community.  We should stress to our youth the importance of marriage and keeping families together.<p>

  <b><li>Individual responsibility.</b> Almost every human being is endowed with the necessary means to be successful -- a sound mind and the ability to think, reason and make choices.  These natural gifts are accompanied with the equal obligation to take responsibility for one's actions.<p>

  <b><li>Free enterprise.</b> Our nation has been the most successful on earth in fostering and promoting a free enterprise system with opportunity for all.  Strengthening this system is our best hope for a thriving economy in the future.
<p>
  <b><li>Less government.</b> The size and influence of government at all levels must be minimized in order to guarantee a free society.  Government should play a role in performing certain functions, like maintaining a strong defense, but we should not expect government to solve all our problems.<p>

  <b><li>Strong Defense.</b> While it is not America's role to be the world's policeman, there are sometimes threats to American lives and interests which we cannot tolerate.<p>

  <b><li>Community-based problem solving</b> Rather than looking to the federal government to solve local problems, such as crime and education, we can and should develop solutions in our local communities.<p>

  <b><li>Good taste and common sense in popular culture.</b> The level of violence, promiscuous sex and immoral behavior on television, in movies and in music lyrics should be reduced as it has adverse effects on society, especially our children.<p>

  <b><li>Compassionate conservatism.</b> While stressing the importance of free enterprise and less government, we must recognize our responsibility as a society to help those who help themselves, or who are unable to help themselves through no fault of their own.<p>
</ol>

<h2><i>POLICY REVIEW: The Journal of American Citizenship</i></h2></center>
<p>
<i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i>, the flagship magazine of <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a>, is published 6 times per year. 
<p>
<i>Policy Review</i> specializes in the study of private-sector and local-government alternatives to the bureaucratic, centralized welfare state. We are dedicated to rebuilding the institutions of American citizenship -- families, neighborhoods, religious institutions, public and private schools, voluntary civic institutions, businesses, and local governments.
<p>
<i>Policy Review</i> profiles great American citizens: Houston constable Victor Trevino is reducing crime with his "zebra squad" of volunteer cops; Sister Connie Driscoll is helping young urban mothers in Chicago; <a href="/heritage/p_review/spring95/tolerth.html">Rev. Frank Reid</a>, of Baltimore's AME Church, is promoting black Christian manhood to the members of his community.
<p>
We study "what works": <a href="/heritage/p_review/spring95/glassth.html">DeVry Institute of Technology</a> sets the standard for career training; Rhode Island's privatized school lunch program tastes better and costs less; private security officers reduce crime around New York's Grand Central Station. 
<p>
We tackle tough subjects, and propose common-sense policy prescriptions, for issues such as <a href="/heritage/p_review/fall95/thegg.html">crime</a>, <a href="/heritage/p_review/summer95/thfost.html">taxes</a>, <a href="/heritage/p_review/fall95/thhood.html">environment</a>, <a href="/heritage/p_review/fall95/thfinn.html">education</a>, <a href="/heritage/p_review/fall95/thsher.html">religion and culture</a>, <a href="/heritage/p_review/summer95/thcraig.htm">adoption and foster care</a>, and <a href="/heritage/p_review/summer95/thbear.html">Social Security</a>. We publish articles by influential people on the major issues of the day. Newt Gingrich, Phil Gramm, <a href="/heritage/p_review/summer95/tharmey.html">Dick Armey</a>, Bill Bennett, Ralph Reed, Bill Kristol, Kate O'Beirne, Grover Norquist, and other key policy makers all contribute to <i>Policy Review</i>.
<p>
<i>Policy Review</i> provides practical, constructive thought -- the best of conservatism-in-action.

<h2>The Telecommunications Revolution</h2>
<h3>An American Opportunity</h3>
<hr width="50%">
<h2>Introduction &amp;  Summary</h2>
</center><blockquote>
<P>
 America is in the midst of  an historic period of  dynamic change
and opportunity driven by a transformation of  technology.  In
1995, one half of all capital investment in America, broadly defined,
will be in computers and telecommunications equipment. The telecommunications
industry already constitutes one seventh of our economy and is
growing.  By the early 21st century, the global information industry
is expected to be a $3 trillion market.  Yet the government statutory
and regulatory system now in place was erected in the 1930s during
the New Deal and embodies the limits and technological realities
of a long-vanished era.
<P>
 To seize the opportunities of the knowledge age, a new, modern
and efficient governmental role with respect to telecommunications
is needed.  Government can, and indeed should, perform certain
tasks.  This report is an effort to identify and focus on the
essential governmental functions needed for America to enter the
new century -- and to cleanse the detritus of the past.  Many
current governmental institutions and regulations are relics of
past practices and  seek to perform tasks better performed by
competitive markets.  The report has a simple goal: to provide
for a modern and effective government to complement market forces
to speed the development of  new products and services for Americans.
<P>
 The new, smaller government role (hereafter the 'Replacement
Model') is based on a functional analysis of what a government
should be for a digital era of the 1990s and beyond.  A functional
analysis reveals certain overarching principles which are applied
by the Replacement Model.  Conceptually, a functional analysis
supports a government role for ensuring parity of  opportunity
 across media such as wireline, cellular, broadcast, DBS and video
dialtone.  The success of any one company or even industry should
reflect their inherent attributes rather than their relative regulatory
handicaps.  With respect to mission, the Replacement Model will
provide for a new Office of Communications (the &quot;OC&quot;)
to be located within an existing Executive Branch agency.  
<P>
 The OC will concentrate on the following tasks: (1) overseeing
the implementation of a transition from the current practice of
universal service based on hidden and elaborate cross-subsidies
to a smaller, more efficient and targeted needs -- based system;
(2) overseeing the mass privatization of  spectrum to the American
people through a sequenced, phased-in  auction process; (3) coordinating
a non-interference standard to govern the private sector's use
of spectrum; and (4) coordinating U.S. international commitments
and opportunities for telecommunications. Supporting the new,
more focused  governmental role will be an emphasis on traditional
antitrust enforcement utilizing existing expertise and personnel
located within the U.S. Department of Justice. 
<P>
 The Replacement Model offers a detailed and  specific action
plan for the transition to a the new, modern government.  Existing
statutes, rules and regulations are either eliminated immediately,
subject to a three year sunset provision, or retained and re-assigned
to the Replacement Model's Office of Communications.  At the end
of the sunset period, those rules and regulations deemed necessary
by the OC to promote economic welfare through competition will
be retained only by affirmative action of Congress.
<P>
 Part One of this report establishes the case for replacing and
modernizing the existing regulatory regime. The focus is on the
systemic influence of  regulations and statutes which authorize
the Federal Communications Commission (&quot;FCC&quot;) and have
inflicted staggering costs upon American consumers and the economy.
 The report recognizes that other restrictions arising from federal/state
mechanisms such as the Modified Final Judgment (&quot;MFJ&quot;)
 settlement also have had an impact on competition.  
<P>
 The systemic problem, however, remains that the statutes, rules
and regulations underlying the FCC have denied through intrusive
regulation the U.S. economy tens of billions of dollars in annual
growth. Current public servants may be dedicated and hard working.
 It is the system itself which in some measure mandates that the
FCC engage in certain practices and procedures which block new
products and services such as cable TV, microwave, cellular, voice
mail, video dialtone and new personal communications services.
For decades these technologies have been denied Americans while
the FCC struggled to decide what to allow to the consumer.  Price
competition has been stymied and business costs ultimately borne
by the American public have been needlessly inflated by a plethora
of entry, ownership and contractual regulations of telephone and
media markets. Part One details the history of this structural
obstruction of technology and competition.
<P>
 Resolving the economic imbalances imposed by universal service
is a key ingredient to any meaningful reform proposal.  Basic
dialtone telephone service for those truly in need is an essential
element to a sustainable modernization of government's role. 
Part Two offers two approaches to providing basic service for
those truly in need.  The approaches make the actual price of
phone service open and clear to the American people.  Currently,
a hidden tax is imposed on all through various subsidies.  Urban
users subsidize rural users. Business and long-distance rates
subsidize residential rates. Much of the money is paid to companies,
not consumers.  Many of the well-to-do get subsidized.   The current
system imposes burdens on those allegedly it seeks to help --
those financially less well off.  An urban, single parent family
on government assistance programs today actually subsidizes the
phone bills of  rural users -- even if the rural user calls from
a ski chalet or vacation home  straight out of  <I>Lifestyles
of the Rich and Famous.</I>
<P>
  Moreover, no one knows what the subsidies cost despite the billions
of dollars in the system because the lack of accountability destroys
incentives to economize.  Like a Soviet-era good under Gosplan,
no one really pays the true cost of the phone services they use.
 The replacement model puts a halt to this muddle.  
<P>
 The model supports the claimed purpose of cross-subsidization,
promotion of so-called &quot;universal service,&quot; but in ways
that are more accountable, explicit and efficient.  Both plans
recognize a <I>national </I> interest in keeping basic phone service
affordable to all Americans.  The first model has three facets.
 First, the federal program to keep residential telephone rates
affordable in high cost areas would be limited to that amount
needed on a going forward basis to provide wireline service to
those areas.  Second, the model embraces use of  a specific, targeted
means test to provide assistance to those truly in need.  Third,
the responsibility for the remainder of the universal service
subsidies paid by interstate long distance callers would devolve
to the state level subject to broad federal guidelines.  Restoration
of market prices and efficient pricing will foster real competition
and result in substantially lower prices.
<P>
 The second approach proposes that the responsibility for maintaining
universal service be transferred to the states.   Those local
exchange costs that are now allocated to the interstate jurisdiction
are returned to the respective states.  Each state could recover
those costs as deemed fit, subject to federal guidelines.  Under
this model, federal law would  pre-empt entry restrictions and
prohibit discriminatory treatment of interstate users for comparable
services. 
<P>
 Both approaches are subject to strict federal guidelines forbidding
price discrimination and requiring interconnection for all competitors.
 Moreover, the Replacement Model continues the federal pre-emption
of state regulation of wireless services.
<P>
 In Part Three, the Replacement Model promotes American competitiveness
through a modern approach to use of  the spectrum. Spectrum is
transferred to private hands in a sequenced,  phased-in approach.
 In Phase One, those with current licenses in spectrum are granted
title to the spectrum currently used.  These owners of spectrum
, the vast majority of whom have already purchased their stations,
will be free to use, transfer and develop spectrum as they deem
necessary.   Property rights in spectrum will be enforced through
traditional legal protections afforded all property owners in
the courts. Under this approach, industry would also have recourse
to the OC for interference issues and use of laboratories for
testing and evaluation of new equipment and technologies.
<P>
 In Phase Two, applications pending before the FCC as of May 1,
1995,  would be granted title to the spectrum on an expedited
basis.  In addition, the OC will on an expedited basis, begin
to roll-out non-allocated spectrum for the presumptive 
<P>
use by private sector entities seeking its use.  Competing bids
for the spectrum will be subject to expedited auction.  This bottom-up,
demand-driven process will allow market forces to determine spectrum
use and jump start competition and technological innovation. 

<P>
 In Phase Three, the government will begin the process of turning
over its spectrum to the private sector by beginning an expedited
survey of available spectrum bands, establishing standardized
parcels for entrants to claim.  The government currently presides
over massive amounts of under-utilized spectrum far in excess
of its needs for possible use by the Department of Defense, NASA,
etc. 
<P>
 In Phase Four, the government will  permit claimants to claim
title to available spectrum as identified in the spectrum survey.
In the event that there are multiple claimants for a particular
parcel of spectrum, an auction will be held.  Each department
making the spectrum available that is subject to an auction will
retain a portion of auction proceeds for modernization to more
efficient digital equipment, re-location expenses and for current
operations.  Remaining auction proceeds can be dedicated to deficit
reduction.
<P>
 The premise again is that spectrum use will be dictated by the
American people, not the government.  The Replacement Model envisions
a governmental role for coordinating &quot;spectrum contours,&quot;
&quot;overlay rights&quot; and &quot;band management rights&quot;
but mandates that these rights be defined quickly and made available
for private investors willing to risk capital in developing new
wireless services.  The key is to sell title in property, not
mere licenses.  Those who claim unchallenged use of identified
parcels or bid and win title to spectrum are free to develop and/or
re-sell the spectrum as with any other private property right
subject to antitrust review and the geographic and interference
boundaries of property assignments.  The primary goal of these
spectrum reforms is the rapid and efficient creation of a spectrum
market and to provide an economic stimulus in job creation.  Recent
announcements by the government confirmed that auctioning spectrum
can also have a supplemental benefit of raising billions in revenue
for deficit reduction.
<P>
  Finally, Part Four sets out a detailed and specific plan for
implementing the Replacement Model's recommendations.   It re-assigns
and re-organizes the functions now performed by the FCC.  The
goal is to focus on the critical tasks for today and the future.
 Government unquestionably should fulfill some functions and services
for the benefit of all Americans.  Others should be eliminated
immediately. A third residual category of FCC rules and regulations
would be sunsetted in three years.
<P>
  The Replacement Model  updates government to account for the
differences between the analog past and the technologies now emerging
through market forces.  For sixty years, the government substituted
administrative, bureaucratic decision-making for the free market.
 Two old, major assumptions -- (1) the existence of a &quot;natural
monopoly&quot; in telecommunications; and (2) the assumption that
technology would remain essentially static or unchanging -- are
untenable for the 21st century.  The model makes a clear break
with the past, embracing competition with antitrust enforcement
and by transferring authority to the states in those instances
when monopoly regulation remains temporarily necessary. The new
role for government is leaner, more cost effective and serves
the American people.   This, then,  is a call to action to meet
the challenges of the telecommunications revolution -- an American
opportunity.

<h2>The Telecommunications Revolution</h2>
<h3>An American Opportunity</h3>
<hr width="50%">
<h2>Part One: The Regulatory Roadblock to the Telecom Revolution</h2>
</center>

<P>

<B>Overview</B>
<P>
 The failure of telecommunications regulation is systemic to the
regulatory structure created by and under the Communications Act
of 1934.  Regulation has been prone to wasteful delay, costly
and unnecessary intrusion on market processes without due regard
for regulation's unintended effects, and abuse of process by special
interests.  These problems are not linked to any particular FCC.
 Rather they span the decades and continue to this day.  Nor are
the hard work and many hours spent by public servants in the FCC
a factor in improving the situation.  It is systemic. In light
of the accelerated pace of technological change and heightened
global competition, the ill effects of this system are increasingly
unacceptable.   
<P>
 The FCC's processes have been prone to delay for three reasons.
 First, considerable delay results simply from good old fashioned
 bureaucratic practices. The Commission's processing of licenses
and formal complaints take inordinately long.  Second, centralized
decision making by regulators dealing with complicated issues
better left to market forces leads to wasteful regulatory vacillation.
 As explained below, the agency's back-and-forth handling of basic
regulatory questions has been extensive.  Third, some of the regulatory
functions assigned to or assumed by the FCC functions duplicate
responsibilities of federal antitrust and other authorities. 
This duplication complicates the review of matters such as telecommunications
and represents needless expense.   
<P>
 Over time, the regulatory system has expanded its regulatory
authority to address problems it did not fully understand in ways
fraught with unintended effects.  Through the financial interest
and syndication and prime time access rules, the FCC attempted
to increase diversity in television programming by attempting
to shift profits from the television networks to Hollywood producers.
 Instead, it simply created a bonanza for game-show producers.
 Through its so-called fairness doctrine, it justified encroachment
on broadcasters' First Amendment rights without due regard for
the chilling of speech.  In the late 1960s and 1970s, the FCC
dramatically increased the tax on interstate long-distance service,
lowering residential telephone rates artificially for the rich
and poor alike.  Perhaps most costly of all, the FCC's top-down
management of the electromagnetic spectrum frustrated the development
of new broadcast stations, television networks and innumerable
&quot;wireless&quot; radio services.  
<P>
 Lastly, the FCC's regulatory process has lent itself to abuse
by existing firms and special interests resistant to competition.
 Using regulatory processes against one's existing or potential
 competitors is a temptation few businesses and almost no trade
association can resist.  The perennial loser of this &quot;gaming&quot;
of the regulatory system has been the American public.  For example,
if the Commission had authorized phone companies to begin competing
directly against cable in 1984, cable consumers would have saved
between $3 and $7 billion annually between 1983 and 1992.  Likewise,
the FCC-imposed delay in licensing cellular telephony cost America
$85 billion in growth and consumption.  
<P>
 The case for reforming and replacing this  failed regulatory
regime is compelling.  Over the last two decades the FCC moved
laboriously -- sometimes in the face of political opposition from
Congress and sometimes after prodding from the courts -- to open
markets to competition and to reform existing regulation. Despite
these steps, the systemic problems persist.   Delay through regulatory
gaming is still the order of the day.  For example, in the past
it was AT&amp;T who opposed opening the long distance and equipment
markets to competition and broadcasters who stymied competition
from cable TV systems.  Today, it is MCI and other long distance
carriers who oppose AT&amp;T's efforts to compete, it is the cable
companies who oppose telephone companies' efforts to compete in
video markets, and it is the broadcasters who oppose satellite-delivered
radio services.  
<P>
 In numerous cases the FCC continues costly regulation and intrudes
on business decision making that could be much better handled
by market forces or state government.  For example, federal price
regulation of the long-distance market is counterproductive. 
Virtually all of the existing broadcast regulation imposed unnecessary
costs ultimately borne by the American viewing public.  Most of
the spectrum remains hostage to bureaucratic gridlock. 
<P>
 The case for radical transformation is even more compelling now
given that the market power rationale for much of this regulatory
intervention has largely disappeared. The telephone industry used
to be a monopoly; but the main segment of that industry under
the FCC's jurisdiction  long-distance service  has become highly
rivalrous.  Although some experts disagree on the current extent
of competition in local telephone service, most would agree that
full competition in the local loop is both feasible and highly
likely.  The broadcast industry used to be oligopolistic; now
the number of broadcasters has burgeoned and they compete vigorously
with cable and direct broadcast satellites.  An invigorated &quot;wireless
cable&quot; (MMDS) industry supplies additional competition, and
telephone companies will enter video markets in the near future.

<P>
  If America's regulatory and statutory regime for telecommunications
dates back to the Communications Act of 1934,  it is helpful to
recall that in 1934 the telegraph still was the dominant form
of communications for Americans. Enacted in the midst of the Great
Depression, the 1934 Act today is defended after the fact by the
following assumptions: (i) a natural monopoly existed in the telecommunications
industry, warranting price-and-entry federal regulation; (ii)
broadcast spectrum , both radio and TV, was scarce and required
federal oversight; and (iii) the analog technologies of the day
dictated the form and function of communications. At that time
only a telephone let people communicate point to point; only a
radio broadcast, for example, could reach out to many.  None of
these assumptions holds true today.   We are now in an era of
accelerating innovation moving towards digital technologies in
 the 21st century:
<UL>
<LI><B>Competition, not monopolies. </B>Introduction of microwave,
fiber optics, cellular, digital cellular, co-axial cable, satellite
and the new personal communications services/personal communications
networks (&quot;PCS/PCN&quot;) mean that competition, rather than
natural monopoly, better characterizes the telecommunications
 industry.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Abundance, not scarcity. </B>The future is and will be
characterized by abundance, not scarcity. Over the wireline, the
capacity to transmit data (&quot;bandwidth&quot;) is doubling
every five years. A fiber in the new fiber optic networks can
carry in 1995 simultaneously 37,500 separate conversations.  The
marginal cost of  transmitting a call is literally zero.
<P>Wireless spectrum also is characterized by new abundance.
 New digital techniques<B> </B>known as Code Division Multiple
Access (&quot;CDMA&quot;)  present a massive wideband increase
in efficient use of spectrum.
<P>In broadcast fields, other compression techniques and advances
in spectrum management open up huge segments of spectrum for commercial,
educational and public applications.
<P>The old approach of the government husbanding scarce spectrum
and tightly regulating its use no longer has a valid basis.  

<LI><B>Flexibility in transmission, not limits.  </B>Digital signals,
consisting of 1s and 0s, do not define and are not characterized
by the devices through which the signals are transmitted. Telephone
calls, faxes, or TV broadcasts can be sent and received by any
variety of platforms, processed by on- board microprocessors.
 Video can be sent into the American home <I>via </I>coax cable,
wireless, satellite direct digital broadcast, or over the telephone
line. Telephone calls can be cellular/ wireless, sent over the
telephone line or through a Cable TV coax cable. In all instances,
how the digital transmissions are sent and the means they are
received do not change the nature of the transmission.  
<P>The 1s and 0s are the same.  The analog technology of the
1934 Act could not offer that flexibility.  A telephone had to
make a phone call.  A radio had to receive a broadcast, etc. 
The 1934 Act's separate provisions for wireline telephones, radio
broadcasts, etc. are obsolete and reflect the limits of analog
technologies. 
</UL>

<P>

<P>
 Despite the rapid growth of competition in all sectors of the
industry, the FCC continues to expand.  At present, the Commission
has over 2,200 full-time employees. Its budget for 1995 is $185
million.  Adjusted for inflation, the Commission's budget fell
6.5 percent during the Reagan Administration.  It rose over 56
percent during the Bush and Clinton Administrations.  In the two
most recent fiscal years, the Commission's budget increased a
total of 35 percent. The Clinton Administration has proposed a
budget for fiscal year 1996 of $224 million, a 62 percent increase
over bloated 1994 levels.
<P>
[FIGURE 1]
<P>
 The Commission's staff has grown from 1,753 full-time employees
in 1993, to a proposed 2,271 for 1996  a 30 percent increase in
three years.  The Common Carrier Bureau employs 270 people, and
spends an estimated $22 million a year.  The Mass Media Bureau
employs 335 employees, spending an estimated $27 million a year.
 The Cable Services Bureau has 223 employees; its 1995 budget
was about $18 million.  About 865 people, or more than 40 percent
of FCC staff, provide &quot;executive direction and support.&quot;
 Nearly 40 percent are engaged in &quot;non-feeable&quot; activities
that cannot be linked to any specific regulatory program.
<P>
 <I><B>The Challenge.  </B></I>Apart from budgetary savings, transforming
telecommunications regulation will create an enormous opportunity
for America.  The pace of technical change and global competition
have accelerated.  The faster the potential rate of innovation,
the greater care that must be taken to assure that regulations
designed to address outmoded monopoly concerns do not have the
unintended effect of retarding innovation.  Likewise, the globalization
of markets and economic liberalization of Soviet bloc and developing
countries have heightened the competition facing U.S. companies.
 At the turn of the century, a country growing at 4 percent per
year would have been considered to have a high growth rate.  Now
something closer to 10 percent would be in order.  Starting in
1780, it took Britain 60 years to double its output per person.
 Beginning in 1880, Japan achieved this feat in 34 years.  Starting
in 1966, South Korea did it in 11 years.  
<P>
 Our country is poised to take advantage of tremendous opportunities
for economic growth and social development through reform of the
government's role in regulating the telecommunications industry.
 At stake is our ability to compete and prosper in an international
information market that is projected to exceed $3 trillion by
the close of the decade.  Our entrepreneurial culture, openness
to innovation and acceptance of robust competition give American
concerns a comparative advantage.  America's technical resurgence,
especially in the digital arena, provides a basis for reforming
its telecom regulatory regime to provide a powerful springboard
to greater technical advance and levels of prosperity.  The chief
obstacle in the way is unnecessary, increasingly costly, regulation.
<P>
 <I><B>The FCC's Performance.  </B></I>The rest of Part One details
some of the regulatory system's &quot;highlights&quot;.  The FCC's poor performance here in part is a symptom of  the regulatory
regime mandated by the 1934 Act.  We consider its processes for
licensing wires and spectrum and its program content. We end by
reviewing wasteful regulatory vacillation,  the complaint process
and duplicative functions.

<h2>The Telecommunications Revolution</h2>
<h3>An American Opportunity</h3>
<hr width="50%">
<h2>1.1 Licensing</h2>
</center><blockquote>

<P>Section 214 of the 1934 Communications
Act gives the FCC broad power to license wireline facilities and
services used in interstate common carriage.  No facilities may
be deployed or operated without the FCC's advance approval.  The
FCC licenses use of the airwaves too, under section 307 of the
Act.  The Commission allocates frequencies to various uses, and
assigns them to specific users.  Cable facilities, by contrast,
are licensed by local authorities; the Commission exercises only
general oversight over the franchising process.
<P>
 Across the board, the Commission's licensing process is characterized
by procrastination, equivocation and seemingly endless delay.
 Unnecessary delay in issuing licenses ultimately found to be
in the public interest imposes enormous costs on the industry
and the national economy.  It particularly increases the risk
and cost of introducing new technologies.  While the FCC equivocates
about issuing new licenses, the market waits.  If a $20 billion
a year industry develops five years later than it might have because
of unnecessary FCC delays in issuing the needed licenses, the
American public pays  in lost services and jobs.
<P>
 <I><B>a. Licensing wires</B></I><B>.  </B>The most surprising
fact about the licensing of interstate wires is that it is required
at all.  There is no obvious reason why a federal commission must
approve every new deployment of equipment, wires or wireline services
that can arguably be characterized as &quot;interstate.&quot;
 As the long-distance telephone industry has demonstrated, entry
can be completely deregulated with no adverse effects.  Nonetheless,
comprehensive licensing by the FCC remains the norm.
<P>
<I>  </I><B>1). </B><I> <B>Customer Premises Equipment</B> (CPE).</I>
 Until the 1960s, the FCC backed AT&amp;T's position that telephones
and other forms of customer premises equipment were an integral
part of &quot;telephone service,&quot; to be provided only by
the monopoly telephone company.  In 1956, for example, the Commission
agreed with AT&amp;T that the sale of the Hush-a-Phone  a small
plastic device that snapped onto the mouthpiece of the phone to
provide privacy  violated AT&amp;T's tariffs and was therefore
illegal.
<P>
 Today, the CPE market is fully competitive.  The market for telephone
handsets alone generates $750 million a year.  Assuming that competition
has driven prices in this market down by 20 percent (a reasonable
assumption) if the FCC had simply approved handset competition
in 1956, when the Hush-A-Phone sought to enter the market, consumers
could have saved several billions between 1956 and the late 1970s
when competition was allowed.
<P>
 These figures reflect what consumers might have saved if the
FCC had merely authorized competition in handset markets.  The
overall market for CPE  including PBXs, key systems, voice processing
equipment, teleconferencing equipment, telephones and fax machines
 generated $16 billion in 1994.  One can only speculate as to
how much more consumers would have saved if the FCC had approved
competition in all CPE markets generally a decade or two before
it did.  What is clear is that in this single market, FCC licensing
delays cost consumers billions of dollars.
<P>
<B>2). <I>Long-distance Services</I></B>.  The Commission's
forty-year effort to protect AT&amp;T from long-distance competitors
tells a similar story.  The FCC grudgingly permitted limited private-line
competition in 1969, six years after MCI filed its first request
to do so.  The Commission rejected subsequent attempts by MCI
to expand its offerings in 1975, and to interconnect with AT&amp;T
in 1978.  On both occasions, MCI had to go to the D.C. Circuit
Court of Appeals to win those rights.
<P>
 Today, long-distance is a $65 billion market, more than double
its 1978 size.  Both the FCC and Department of Justice maintain
that competition in long-distance markets has spurred innovation
and pushed prices sharply down.  To the extent this is so, the
Commission's decades-long policy of <I>forbidding</I> competition
in long-distance markets once again cost consumers tens of billions
of dollars had the FCC fully opened long-distance markets in 1968,
rather than in 1978.
<P>
 The FCC's regulation of the competitive process in the long distance
market has also denied consumers the benefits of robust competition.
  Throughout the 1980s, the FCC stymied efforts by the incumbent
carrier to cut prices in the face of competition.   When it eventually
allowed AT&amp;T to respond by introducing optional calling plans
in the residential market and tariff 12 and contract offerings
in the business market, prices fell substantially.  Amazingly,
long-distance carriers continue to operate under difficult notice
and tariff requirements.  Just this year, MCI intervened to delay
reductions in tariffs that would have given consumers discounts
up to 50%.  MCI contended that the rates were too low. The delay
in introducing the plan, which was finally approved, cost consumers
an estimated $30 million. Generally, had competition been permitted
to reduced interstate rates by 10 percent, consumers would have
saved tens of billions of  dollars.
<P>
<I>  </I><B>3). <I>Enhanced Services</I></B>.  The Commission's
two-decade crusade against the provision of &quot;enhanced services&quot;
by telephone companies has imposed yet another layer of costs.
 From the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s, the Commission enforced
a policy of &quot;maximum separation&quot; between &quot;basic&quot;
voice services and network-based data processing, electronic services,
and computers.  The Commission did not back away from this quarantine
until 1986, and did not allow AT&amp;T or the Bell Companies to
provide enhanced services directly until 1992.  Today, enhanced
services comprise a $13.6 billion market.  Phone companies compete
head-to-head with independent providers to deliver enhanced services
like voice mail to consumers.
<P>
 It is impossible to estimate precisely what this unnecessary
quarantine has cost consumers.  But the single example of voice
mail demonstrates that the costs were staggering.  Today, phone
companies provide voice-mail services at roughly $5 a month per
mailbox, to roughly ten million customers.  This single service
alone is thus a $600 million a year industry in the U.S. economy.
 Yet the market scarcely existed at all until phone companies
were finally authorized to serve it.  Though the technology was
available in the 1970s, if not earlier, FCC permission to deploy
it did not come until 1988.  The cost to the economy from the
Commission's delay in authorizing these services has been estimated
to approximate $6 billion.
<P>
<I>  </I><B>4). <I>Cable TV</I></B>.  In 1958, the Commission
declared that it had no jurisdiction over cable television; cable
was viewed as a strictly local matter.  The Commission revisited
the issue in 1959 and again disclaimed jurisdiction.  In 1962,
the FCC decided it would regulate cable, but only indirectly,
through the microwave systems used to import distant television
signals.  The FCC adopted a more general cable policy in 1965,
still relying on its authority over microwave common carriers.
 Finally, the Commission announced it had full jurisdiction over
cable after all, because cable competed with television.
<P>
 The Commission did not wade into the threshold business of franchising
local cable networks; it left that to local authorities.  Instead,
as described below, the Commission set out general rules for what
cable systems could or must carry, simply to limit cable competition
against established broadcasters.
<P>
 Cable today is a $23 billion a year industry.  Once again, it
is impossible to quantify with precision what consumers lost by
Commission policies that aimed to suppress cable for the benefit
of broadcasters.  But given the high value consumers place on
television programming,  the Commission-imposed drag on competition
certainly cost consumers billions of dollars in the 1960s and
1970s.
<P>
<I>  </I><B>5). <I>Video Dialtone</I></B><I> (VDT)</I>.  In 1970,
the FCC put in place rules to exclude phone companies from the
provision of video programming and cable television.  In 1987
it suggested that the policy might be inhibiting competition and
began to reevaluate it.  The reevaluation occupied the Commission
for five years.  In 1992 the Commission again declared its general
support for telco provision of video dialtone services.  Many
phone companies then filed for permission to provide commercial
services.  The Commission took another two years to approve the
first such application.
<P>
 In the few markets where a second cable company has challenged
the first, cable television rates are 20 to 30 percent lower than
in markets served by only a single provider.  If the Commission
had authorized phone companies to begin competing directly against
cable in 1984, and had phone companies actually entered at that
time, cable subscribers could have benefited from billions in
savings <I>a</I> <I>year</I> for the period from 1983 to 1992.
<P>
 The Replacement Model recognizes that federal licensing of both
common-carrier and cable wires and their uses is now obsolete.
 State regulators already oversee the physical deployment of facilities
along public rights of way.  State authorities likewise regulate
the prices charged by local phone companies in areas where the
phone companies are still deemed to possess monopoly power.  The
FCC's role in licensing wireline facilities is now simply an expensive
anachronism, one that costs the economy enormously in lost competition
and yields no concomitant benefits whatsoever.  The Replacement
Model addresses this by updating the 1934 Act specifically in
Part Four, sharply reducing any federal role in licensing and
therefore slowing the introduction of the wireline facilities.
 
<P>
 <B>b.  <I>Licensing spectrum</I>. </B>Licensing of spectrum presents
somewhat different problems.  Two adjacent radio stations cannot
broadcast on the same frequencies simultaneously; rules or property
rights of some kind are needed to prevent interference.  The Commission
licenses spectrum to private users for fixed periods of time.
 With few exceptions, the licenses are given away; they are not
sold.
<P>
 Protracted delays in issuing licenses cost both industry and
consumers enormously.  And the Commission seldom issues licenses
cleanly; there are almost always many strings attached.  These
prescriptions impose additional, large costs on the economy and
consumer welfare.
<P>
<I>  </I><B>1). <I>Radio and Television</I></B>.  The introduction
of both FM radio and television was delayed by years of FCC equivocation
over which bands would be assigned to which uses.  FM radio technology,
which was invented in 1933, was not in widespread use until the
1960s.  The modern television was exhibited by RCA in 1939, but
the FCC took years to adopt initial standards.  The FCC then froze
all applications for TV licenses until 1952.  In the year after
the freeze was ended, the number of stations tripled. However,
a 1952 FCC decision deliberately limited the number of viable
stations per market  and impeded the creation of additional TV
networks at enormous cost to the American viewing public.
<P>
 Licensing radio transmitters of every kind remains one the Commission's
largest and most time-consuming activities.  Between 1984 and
1994, the Commission designated 6,834 broadcast license applications
for hearing.  The administrative costs of those proceedings approached
$50 million over ten years.  Licensing broadcast applicants by
lottery would have cost the FCC just over $12 million; licensing
via auction would have cost just $2.4 million, in addition to
generating substantial revenue.
<P>
 But those numbers pale beside the costs society bears while it
waits for the FCC to get licenses out the door.  Judging from
the secondary market, broadcast licenses for AM radio, FM radio
and broadcast television are worth, in the aggregate, about $13
billion.  Direct broadcast satellite (DBS) spectrum is worth an
estimated $3 billion; MMDS spectrum is worth roughly $1 billion;
IVDS spectrum is worth over $200 million.  Spectrum, in short,
is an enormously valuable commodity  when it finally gets into
private hands.  In the aggregate, broadcast spectrum licenses
in use today are worth an estimated $17 billion.
<P>
 With a commodity this valuable, every year, every month, of delay
in putting it to productive use costs the economy enormously.
 If it just sits idle for a year, the economy suffers an irretrievable
loss.  If FCC licensing procedures were responsible for delaying
the movement of  spectrum into productive, private uses, the delays
would be responsible for reducing the broadcast industry's total
revenues by about $38 billion, and total economic output by a
substantial fraction of this $38 billion.
<P>
<I>  </I><B>2. <I>Cellular</I>.</B>  Cellular technology was first
conceived in 1947 by Bell Laboratories.  AT&amp;T was operating
its first experimental cellular telephone system in 1962, but
the FCC did not even get around to allocating spectrum for cellular
until 1974.  The first cellular licenses were not handed out until
1983.  Today, the cellular industry generates some $14.2 billion
in revenues a year.
<P>
 But the delays were much longer than a year.  Cellular service
could have been introduced a decade earlier; the technology was
in hand, and the only obstacle was FCC licensing.  Economists
estimate that the decade of delay cost  America roughly $85 billion.
<P>
 At a finer level of detail, the economy lost millions simply
because cellular licenses were issued through lengthy comparative
hearings rather than through quick auctions.  Comparative hearings
typically took 18 months.  In 1985, it was estimated that delays
of that order eroded the value of each cellular license by $90,000
and cost the government $20,000 per hearing in administrative
costs.  Extrapolated over the 60 licenses for which comparative
hearings were used, this method of license assignment cost the
economy roughly $9 million.  The remaining 1,400 cellular licenses
were assigned through a lottery process, which was estimated to
have delay and administrative costs of $67,000 per license; overall,
these lotteries thus cost the economy another $130 million in
1994 dollars.  Auctions, if used instead, could have saved the
economy more than $100 million. 
<P>
<I>  </I><B>3). <I>PCS</I>.</B>  The FCC's handling of Personal
Communication Services (&quot;PCS&quot;) licenses marked a significant
improvement over past practices.  But even here, unnecessary delays
have been very costly.  PCS services were introduced in the United
Kingdom in 1989.  That same year, the FCC received two petitions
for a PCS rulemaking.  In the more than five years since, fewer
than 150 of the nearly 3,500 broadband and narrowband PCS licenses
have actually been assigned.
<P>
 Assuming that PCS competition can push the price of wireless
phone service down by 20 percent, existing cellular consumers
would have realized more than $9 billion in savings if PCS licenses
had been assigned five years ago.  If PCS had added five millionnew wireless customers during that period, an additional gain
to the economy of more than $1.5 billion from subscriber revenue
would have been realized.
<P>
<I>  </I><B>4). <I>Subcarrier Channels</I></B>.  Radio and TV
stations can readily use interstitial bits of their spectrum to
transmit paging signals, electronic TV guides, and other kinds
of data.  The transmission of radio programming via subchannel
frequencies was developed as early as 1948.  The Commission did
not permit use of these frequencies for anything but broadcast
services until 1983.  In 1994, the subcarrier market was worth
$40 million.  Had the FCC decided in 1948 to permit unlimited
use of subcarrier frequencies, the economy would have gained hundreds
of millions of  dollars.
<P>
<I><B>  </B></I><B>5).  <I>Vertical Blanking Intervals</I></B><I>
(VBI)</I>.  Restrictions on another usable part of the broadcast
video signal  the vertical blanking interval (VBI)  have entailed
significant losses as well.  The VBI was first used in 1967. 
But for the next 16 years the FCC did not permit the VBI to be
used for anything but closed-captioning.  In 1983, the Commission
finally authorized television stations to begin offering teletext
services on the VBI; additional VBI communications services such
as data transmission, computer software delivery, and paging were
authorized in 1985.  Total dollar values for this market are unavailable,
but like FM subcarriers, the delay in permitting full use of VBI
technology imposed an unnecessary cost on the economy.  
<P>
<I>  </I><B>6).  <I>Spectrum Zoning</I></B>.  Sub-carrier channels
and the VBI illustrate a more general point: the FCC routinely
&quot;zones&quot; spectrum licenses.  Licensees may use the spectrum
only in the specific, designated ways approved by the Commission
at the outset.  A licensee that discovers a new way of squeezing
more transport out of its spectrum (as sub-carrier and VBI technologies
allow), or discovers an entirely new, more valuable way of using
the spectrum  must go back to the Commission for a new license
 and risk standing in line for years or even decades while the
Commission considers the matter.
<P>
 The gains from dezoning can be substantial.  A government study
concluded that if a single UHF television station in Los Angeles
were to shut down and transfer its spectrum to a third cellular
provider, the overall public gain would be about $1 billion over
eight years.  This study predates the PCS decision and assumes
that the introduction of the third provider would cause a 25 percent
reduction in prices.  What the PCS auctions indicate are that
markets will move spectrum to higher valued uses.  Another example
is  Nextel (formerly &quot;Fleet Call&quot;).  In 1991, Nextel
purchased approximately 9 MHz of spectrum for roughly $45 million
in the Los Angeles market to provide digital wireless telephone
service.
<P>
 The Replacement Model, in Part Three, identifies a procedure
to permit the American economy to capture gains by dezoning spectrum
licenses across the board.  The simple <I>deletion</I> of a few
lines of legal boilerplate from FCC spectrum licenses -- and a
streamlined &quot;rollout&quot; of spectrum for creative use by
the private sector -- could create a very substantial increase
in social welfare nationwide.

<h2>The Telecommunications Revolution</h2>
<h3>An American Opportunity</h3>
<hr width="50%">
<h2>1.2 Content and Program Regulation</h2>
</center><blockquote>
<P>
 <B>a. <I>Broadcast Program Formats. </I></B>Neither the Radio
Act of 1927 nor the Communications Act of 1934 expressly requires
broadcasters to provide specific kinds of programming or to serve
any particular constituency.  The Commission, however, spent decades
trying to prescribe program formats.
<P>
 In 1946, the FCC published its &quot;Public Service Responsibility
of Broadcast Licensees&quot;  the &quot;Blue Book.&quot;  In applying
for license renewals, broadcasters were to show they had provided
&quot;balanced program structure.&quot;  In 1960, the Commission
replaced the Blue Book with even more specific guidelines as to
what constituted a well balanced programming structure.  From
1970 to 1981, the FCC tried unsuccessfully to curtail its program
review. The D.C. Circuit disagreed a third time.  In 1981 the
Supreme Court at last agreed that the Commission could reasonably
leave program formats to the marketplace.  The Commission eliminated
certain programming guidelines for radio in 1981, and for broadcast
television in 1984. 
<P>
 The Commission continues to insist, however, that programming
respond to &quot;community needs.&quot;  FCC regulation superflously
requires every radio and television broadcaster to provide &quot;significant
programming&quot; to five or more community issues each quarter.
 The Prime Time Access Rule, promulgated in 1970, and modified
in 1974 and 1975, still requires network affiliates to devote
at least one of the four daily &quot;prime time&quot; hours to
non-network programming.
<P>
 The decades of Commission meddling with program formats have
served no demonstrably useful purpose at all.  Between 1934 and
1978, the Commission found only eighteen occasions not to renew
a license because of inadequate program service.  Its programming-related
license revocation rate was less than one station every two years.
 Indeed, it has only refused to renew 142 licenses in all, for
any reason.  The vast majority of license renewals are approved.
<P>
<I> <B>b.</B> <B>The Fairness Doctrine</B></I><B>.</B>  In an
effort to make the airwaves accessible to the largest variety
of voices, the Commission instituted the so-called &quot;Fairness
Doctrine&quot; in 1949.  Broadcasters were to offer access to
their facilities for the airing of opposing viewpoints.  In 1959,
these rules were partly codified by Congress in its &quot;equal
time&quot; amendments to section 315 of the Communications Act.
 In 1967, the FCC extended the doctrine to advertising, or at
least to cigarette advertising.  In 1974 the Commission retreated
from this position and exempted all commercial advertising except
for &quot;editorial advertisements.&quot;  In 1981, the FCC determined
the Fairness Doctrine was no longer in the public interest and
in 1987, repealed it.  During the course of nearly 40 years, the
Commission issued more than 20 orders in pursuit of this policy.
<P> <HR>

<P>
<B>The FCC on the Fairness Doctrine:</B>                                
<P>                                                                 
<B>1974:</B><I> [T]he First Amendment impels, rather than prohibits, governmental promotion of a system which will ensure that the public will be informed of the important issues which confront it. . .The purpose and foundation of the fairness doctrine is therefore that of the First Amendment itself.</I>  (48 F.C.C.2d at   
5-6)                                                             
                           <P>                                      
<B>1985:</B><I> [W]e no longer believe that the fairness doctrine, as a matter of policy, serves the public interest. . . Furthermore, we find that the fairness doctrine, in operation, actually inhibits the presentation of controversial issues of public importance to the detriment of the public and in degradation of the editorial prerogatives of broadcast journalists.</I>  (102       
F.C.C.2d at 147)                                                 
                                                                 
<B>1987:</B><I> [W]e are persuaded that the fairness doctrine is unconstitutional on its face.</I>  (2 F.C.C. Rec. at 5047).          

<P>
<HR>

<P>
<I> </I><B>c. <I>Cable Programming</I></B><I>.</I>  The Commission
has also spent three decades trying to dictate what kind of programming
should or should not be carried on cable.  In 1966, the FCC tried
to persuade Congress to prohibit cable from originating its own
programming.  Three years later the Commission embraced the opposite
position: larger cable systems were <I>required</I> to originate
their own local programming on at least one channel.  The rule
survived two months; the Eighth Circuit found that the Commission
lacked the authority to regulate cable this way.  The Supreme
Court eventually upheld the Commission's power to require cable
program origination, but expressed no view on the validity of
the content rules.  In 1974, however, the Commission deleted the
origination requirement entirely.  The 1984 Cable Act expressly
forbids the FCC from imposing any new requirements concerning
the content of cable television services.                    
<P>                                    
<HR>
<P>
<B>The FCC on Cable Program Origination:</B>                                          
                                                                               
<B>1966:</B><I> [W]e shall urge that Congress prohibit the origination of program or other material by a [cable] system.</I>  (2 F.C.C.2d at 787)                       
        <P>                                                                       
<B>1969:</B><I> [W]e have accordingly concluded that, at least for the present, [cable] operators should be eligible to engage in program origination, and encouraged or even required to do so.</I>  (20 F.C.C.2d at 206)                               
        <P>                                                                       
<B>1974:</B><I> [T]he Commission has concluded that the mandatory origination scheme is not likely to be the most effective means of fostering local expression in programming. . . .Accordingly, we have decided to eliminate the mandatory origination requirement.</I>  (49 F.C.C.2d at 1104)                                

<P>
<HR>

<P>
 A second FCC rulemaking crusade has addressed the carriage of
broadcast stations on cable.  In 1965, the FCC issued its first
set of &quot;must carry&quot; rules, directing cable providers
to carry local broadcast signals.  It revised the rules in 1972.
 In 1985, the D.C. Circuit struck down the Commission's rules.
 The Commission immediately responded with a new set of rules.
 These were struck down again a year later.  In 1992, Congress
passed its own version of must-carry rules.  A three-judge district
court upheld the rules; the Supreme Court has remanded the case
for further factual findings.  Since 1965, the Commission has
issued 57 orders promulgating or affirming must-carry rules, acted
on hundreds of petitions for carriage by broadcasters and waiver
requests by cable operators, and been reversed on appeal twice.

<P>
 While it has tried to require cable to carry some broadcast stations,
the FCC has labored equally hard to forbid carriage of others.
 Rules were designed to outlaw &quot;leapfrogging&quot;  the importation
of a distant network affiliate rather than a nearby one.  In 1970,
the Commission proposed a new version of &quot;distant signal&quot;
rules, somewhat less restrictive than the old.  In 1972 the Commission
changed its regime yet again.  Almost before the ink had dried,
the FCC began to amend and backtrack.  In 1976, the FCC eliminated
the &quot;leapfrogging rules.&quot;
<P>
<I> </I><B>d. <I>Financial Syndication Rules (Fin-Syn)</I>.</B>
 For many years, the Commission labored to control the relationships
between television networks and suppliers of TV programming in
order to encourage more diverse programming.  The Commission initiated
its first rulemaking on the subject in 1965.  Five years later
it issued its financial interest and syndication (&quot;fin-syn&quot;)
rules, which barred the networks from selling network-produced
programming directly to independent stations and from acquiring
a financial interest in syndicated programming. 
<P>
 The Department of Justice followed in 1974 with an antitrust
suit against the three networks, which resulted in a consent decree
that largely incorporated the FCC's rules.  After those decrees
expired in 1991, the FCC tried to reinstitute a modified set of
rules; these were struck down by the Seventh Circuit.  In thirty
years, the Commission has come roughly full circle.  The networks
have as much leeway to purchase and sell programming in 1995 as
they had in 1965.  In the three decades in between, however, the
Commission significantly intruded on this process.  Along the
way it issued 15 major opinions and a comprehensive staff report,
and defended its action before federal appellate courts three
times.  During much of this period a comprehensive antitrust consent
decree addressed precisely the same concerns and both were based
on misguided notions of network power over program supply.
<P>
 The Replacement Model, in Part Four, <I>infra</I>, proposes immediate
elimination or in a few instances sunsetting all program content
regulations.  Media markets are competitive today and will be
still more rivalrous tomorrow.   Content regulation is unnecessary,
counterproductive, and runs afoul of the First Amendment rights
of speakers.

<h2>The Telecommunications Revolution</h2>
<h3>An American Opportunity</h3>
<hr width="50%">
<h2>1.3 Wasteful Vacillation</h2>
</center><blockquote>

<P> Centralized decision-making
by the FCC deals with complicated issues better left to market
forces.  Consequently, with rare exceptions, Commission rulemaking
is a quagmire of false starts, delay, backtracking, and endless
fine-tuning.  The Commission announces a major new regulatory
scheme: time and again, after substantial delay, it then abandons
it, drastically revises it, steps back to an earlier plan previously
discarded, or starts all over again after a rebuff from the courts.
 Both industry incumbents and firms considering entry spend years
guessing at what the final regulatory regime will be.  Endless
uncertainty in the regulatory process entails huge losses for
both consumers and providers alike.
<P>
<I> <B>a. Enhanced Services Supplied by Phone Companies</B></I>.
 The Commission has been equivocating for three decades over the
rules to govern phone company provision of &quot;enhanced services,&quot;
like voice mail.  During that period, the Commission has issued
over 150 orders, and has made five trips to appellate courts to
defend its rules. 
<P>
 The process began in 1966, when the FCC began investigating the
convergence of computers and communications.  Seven years later,
this <I>Computer</I> <I>I</I> proceeding culminated in rules mandating
that telephone companies offer enhanced services only through
separate subsidiaries.  Just three years into this scheme, the
Commission proposed another.  Its <I>Computer</I> <I>II</I> inquiry
lasted almost eight years.  <I>Computer</I> <I>II</I> resulted
in a new definition of what kinds of services properly belonged
in the separate subsidiaries.  Two years after this scheme was
fully developed, the FCC reconsidered the rules again: <I>Computer</I>
<I>III</I> had been launched.  <I>Computer III</I> would eliminate
the separate subsidiary requirement; network interconnection requirements
and accounting rules, the Commission now concluded, would suffice.
 A fourth rulemaking proposal was issued in February 1995.  Astonishingly,
the Commission is proposing separate subsidiaries once again,
the position first adopted in 1966.

<I> </I><B>b. <I>Cable Television Supplied by Phone Companies</I></B>.
 In 1968, the Commission declared that telephone companies required
certification before they could offer cable television service.
 The Commission formally barred telephone companies from the cable
market in 1970.  With hardly any consideration of the matter,
Congress codified the ban in the 1984 Cable Act.  In August 1986,
the FCC began reexamining the ban; by 1988 it had tentatively
concluded that it didn't serve the public interest.  In 1991,
the Commission invited further comment on the ban.  A year later,
the Commission formally recommended that Congress repeal it.
<P>
 In 1993, phone companies finally brought First Amendment challenges
against their blanket exclusion from the arena of &quot;video
speech.&quot;  Since then, fifteen federal judges have examined
the ban.  Without a single dissenting vote so far, all have concluded
that the ban is unconstitutional.
<P>
 The FCC has responded with open defiance: it has simply reaffirmed
its power to license all phone company operations under the common
carrier (not the cable television) provisions of the Communications
Act.  Phone companies have filed a new round of First Amendment
challenges.

is another example of FCC obstruction of market forces.  After
a decade of skirmishing and with prodding from an appellate court,
the FCC struck down all tariffs barring foreign attachments in
1968.  This ruling did not, however, cover handsets; they would
still be provided exclusively by the monopoly carrier.  It was
1975 before the FCC allowed full competition in the provision
of CPE, nearly 25 years after the issue arose.  In the process,
the Commission issued nearly 60 major notices and orders, including
13 in the Computer II proceedings dealing with structural separation

<h2>The Telecommunications Revolution</h2>
<h3>An American Opportunity</h3>
<hr width="50%">
<h2>1.4 Processing Complaints</h2>
</center><blockquote>

<P>
Some significant share of the
FCC's budget and energy is spent on processing complaints.  The
Commission does keep track of how many complaints are filed, and
tallies how many it takes off of the books.  But the Commission
makes no attempt to determine whether complaints are resolved
to anyone's ultimate satisfaction.  Most complaints of any significance
simply put the Commission in the position of adjudicating disputes
between large corporations, disputes that often require ultimate
resolution in court.
<P>
<I> </I><B>a. <I>Common Carriage</I></B>.  The Commission is required
by statute to investigate and dispose of all complaints against
interstate common carriers.  Charges against carriers for violations
of the Act generally begin as informal complaints. During fiscal
year 1993, the most recent year for which figures have been made
publicly available, the Enforcement Division of the Common Carrier
Bureau received more than 10,000 informal complaints.   There
is no way of knowing how long the Commission takes on average
to dispose of an informal complaint.
<P>
 A complainant may follow up the initial round with a formal complaint.
Formal  complaint proceedings must conform to strict standards
prescribed by the Commission. Judging from reports in the F.C.C.
Record, the Commission has adjudicated some 154 formal carrier
complaints from 1990 to March of 1995.  Nearly 90 percent (134)
involved disputes between two or more carriers.  Most end user
complaints were brought by large entities such as Bank of America
or local utility companies.  Only four of the complaints were
brought by individual customers; of these, three were dismissed
by the Commission.  During the past five years, the Commission
required an average of almost three years to adjudicate a formal
complaint against a carrier.
<P>
<I> </I><B>b.  <I>Cable.</I></B>  The procedures for cable rate
complaints are similar to those used for common carriage.  Complaints
are simply forwarded to the cable operator, which is then expected
to respond.  Broadcasters may also petition for must-carry rights.
 After considering the initial petition and comments, the bureau
may issue a ruling or specify additional procedures such as oral
argument, an evidentiary hearing or further written submissions.
  The 38 complaints of unreasonable rates resolved by the full
Commission since the 1992 Act took effect required an average
of almost fourteen months to resolve.  Must-carry complaints resolved
between 1990 and 1994 took an average of six months.
<P>
<I> </I><B>c. <I>Broadcast</I></B><I>.</I>  Between 1990 and 1995,
the Commission issued more than 4,500 orders and notices concerning
disputes over the regulation, licensing, construction, and spectrum
allocation for radio and television broadcasters.  Most complaints
are filed around the time licenses come up for renewal, when complaints
may help tip the scale against an incumbent and in favor of a
challenger.  During the first five of the six months before its
license is due to expire, a station must post its renewal application
for public view and announce over the air its intention to renew
and the schedule for filing public comments.  The Commission takes
the station's complaint record into account when deciding whether
to renew a license.  There is apparently no &quot;resolution&quot;
of complaints of this sort beyond that.
<P>
 The FCC also processes a large number of complaints concerning
spectrum interference.  Most of these complaints are processed
by regional and local FCC district offices.  Market forces, controlled
by property rights, contracts and privately-enforced limits on
trespassing, could do the job at least equally well.

</PRE>
<HR>

<P>

<P>
 When AT&amp;T sought to acquire McCaw Cellular, for example,
the Department of Justice reviewed the proposed merger.  The Commission
mercifully decided not to invoke its Clayton Act jurisdiction,
but rather to consider antitrust issues in connection with the
application to transfer the radio licenses.  Had it chosen to
conduct the Department's whole antitrust review again, it could
have.  Though it would have been expected to consider the Department's
conclusions, the Commission would not have been bound by them.

<P>
 In addition to enforcing the antitrust laws, the FCC has put
in place a huge labyrinth of structural rules aimed at preventing
antitrust violations before they even occur.  These rules generally
forbid more than is necessary, particularly when markets are changing
fast, and thus suppress more competition than they promote.  For
example, the Commission's rules ban affiliations between newspapers
and broadcasters;<B> </B>prohibit common ownership of two or more
television stations, two or more AM stations, or two or more FM
stations with overlapping service contours; prohibit common ownership
of a television station and an AM or FM radio station in the same
market; ban telephone companies from acquiring Enhanced Specialized
Mobile Radio (ESMR) licenses  in or out of their telephone service
areas; bar cross-ownership of broadcast television and cable systems
in the same market; and preclude local exchange carriers from
providing video programming in their service areas.  
<P>
 The FCC has duplicated most of the mandates of the AT&amp;T divestiture
decree.  The FCC regulates equal access, cross-subsidization and
vertical integration.  The Department of Justice and the consent
decree purport to do so as well.  The decree forbids the Bell
Operating Companies from discriminating in the dissemination of
network information; under the Commission's &quot;All Carrier
Rule,&quot; carriers must make any information necessary for carrier
interconnection available in a timely manner and on a reasonable
basis. 
<P>
 FCC regulation duplicates Department of Justice antitrust enforcement
in other areas, as well.  In 1974, for example, the Department
of Justice filed an antitrust suit that sought to limit the power
of ABC, CBS and NBC to monopolize prime-time entertainment by
combining with their affiliates and controlling all access to
network air time.  All three networks signed consent decrees that
incorporated the FCC's weaker rules on the subject and added stricter
conditions.  Unlike the FCC rules, however, most elements of the
consent agreements were to sunset in 1991.  The remaining provisions
were vacated on November 8, 1993, by which time the networks were
clearly in decline.
<P>
 The 1992 Cable Act and FCC rules implementing it likewise address
relations between cable operators and their video programming
affiliates.  But actions brought separately by the Department
of Justice and a group of state Attorneys General against various
major cablecasters culminated in two 1993 consent decrees addressing
precisely the same issues.  The decrees require the video programming
affiliates of several major cable operators -- including the largest,
TCI -- to provide their programming to other video distributors
(like operators of direct broadcast satellites) on reasonable,
non-discriminatory terms.  Unlike the Commission's regulations,
these decrees address specific circumstances that present serious
anticompetitive concerns; they are targeted at particular defendants
and a specific record of abuse.
<P>
 The Commission duplicates itself internally as well.  It recently
announced, for example, plans to regulate cable television services
provided by phone companies under both Title II and Title VI.
 Thus, non-common-carrier cable television service, ordinarily
licensed under section 541 of Title VI, must <I>in addition</I>
be licensed under the more restrictive provisions of section 214
of Title II.  The two Titles, however, create sharply different
and inconsistent rights and duties.
<P>
 Finally, there is extensive overlap between FCC and state authority.
 Every major line and switch operated by local phone companies
for the joint provision of in-state and interstate services is
allocated roughly three parts to state regulators and one part
to the FCC; the regulation of all matters of depreciation, pricing
and so on are double regulated accordingly.

<h2>PART TWO: A NEW MODEL FOR COMPETITION, UNIVERSAL SERVICE, AND DEVOLUTION</h2>
</center><blockquote>

<P>
 The 1934 Communications Act required the FCC to &quot;make available,
so far as possible, to all people of the United States, a rapid,
efficient, Nation-wide, and world-wide wire and radio communication
service.&quot;  This language has been used to justify so-called
universal service policies designed to encourage penetration of
telephone service to as many households as possible.  The means
of  doing so was through massive cross-subsidies administered
through the FCC.  As of this writing, over 96 percent  of American
households have access to a telephone.  While it  is not clear
that these subsidies have any material impact on maintaining this
access rate, they do suppress toll calling and greatly complicate
the introduction of local competition.
<P>
 Competition poses a direct challenge to existing universal service
subsidies designed to keep local residential rates lower than
they otherwise would be.  The local telephone companies and their
state regulators transfer among themselves, out of the public
eye, literally billions and billions of dollars.  Residential
telephone services have been priced below cost since at least
the 1940s.  At present, there are five explicit support funds
administered by the FCC-mandated National Exchange Carriers Association
(&quot;NECA&quot;).  Most of the $1.4 billion disbursed by NECA
yearly goes to support low-cost telephone service to high-cost
rural areas.
<P>
 There are disagreements regarding the magnitude of current implicit
rate support payments.  The current transfer payments are estimated
to be about $20 billion a year.  The going-forward cost of subsidizing
wireline service to high-cost areas is estimated to be less than
$7 billion.  No responsible party seriously challenges the existence
of a substantial subsidy.
<P>
 Below-cost residential service constitutes one of the largest
off-budget entitlements programs.  Generations of economists have
criticized the program.  Its inefficiencies, faulty signals and
fundamental unfairness have been amply documented.   Moreover,
competition makes this subsidy program increasingly unsustainable.
  It is grounded on gross, government-sanctioned price distortions.
 The same product is sold to different customers at inordinately
different prices.   Such discrimination can be sustained only
when customers can be denied access to alternatives.  Competition
and technological advance are exactly that -- alternatives.
<P>
 <I><B>The replacement model: two approaches.</B></I>  <B> </B>While
one need not be convinced of the need to continue to provide subsidized
access to high-cost areas, two alternative approaches are identified
below to maintain (perhaps increase) telephone penetration rates
at less cost and in fairer, more efficient ways.

<h2>The Telecommunications Revolution</h2>
<h3>An American Opportunity</h3>
<hr width="50%">
<h2>2.1 The Federal Universal Service Plan Approach.</h2>
</center><blockquote>

<P>
 </B></I>Under the Federal Universal Service Plan, every residential
and business telephone customer would pay a universal service
line charge for each access line it purchases.  The plan is similar
in concept to the existing federal charge levied against all long
distance subscribers of 52 cents per subscriber but under this
plan, the customer would make the direct payment.  The U.S. line
charge addresses two goals: (i) keep affordable service in high
cost areas; and (ii) fund policies targeted at the needy.  The
charges would be made explicit to endusers and be explained in
billing.
<P>
 <B>a.  <I>High-cost areas. </I></B> The high-cost subsidy would
be limited to companies serving high-cost areas.  Within 180 days
of enacting legislation, the new Office of  Communications would
determine a &quot;high-cost schedule&quot; which would set out
the cost of serving high-cost areas. The national average cost
of local basic dialtone service now is estimated to be about 
$18.00.  The replacement model envisions using census block data
currently available and the going-forward costs of serving those
lines. 
<P>
 Under the federal U.S. plan, the total high-cost subsidy would
initially be the product of the number of high-cost lines times
each line's respective &quot;line subsidy.&quot;  The line subsidy
is the cost of serving that line as indicated in the high-cost
schedule minus the $18.00 national average cost of service.  Each
year the high-cost subsidy is recovered by a monthly universal
service subscriber line charge levied equally on all residential
and business access lines.  
<P>
 Companies serving high-cost areas, the so-called carriers of
last resort, receive a subsidy payment for each high-cost line
equal to its line subsidy, that is, the cost of serving that line
as indicated on the high-cost schedule minus $18.00.  Over a fifteen
year period, the line subsidy payments would be reduced by one
dollar a year.  The total high-cost subsidy amount and the universal
service subscriber line charge would be reduced accordingly. 

<P>
 After three years, all carrier of last resort payments would
be put up for competitive bid.  The individual states would define
the relevant carrier of last resort areas within which bidding
would take place, but the areas should be defined as narrowly
as possible to preclude distortion to competition.  The high-cost
line subsidy and the carrier of last resort payment would be reduced
to reflect the competitive bidding process.
<P>
 Alternatively, the subsidies could be paid directly to subscribers
in high-cost areas.  In that case, the phase down of the subsidy
should be increased to replace the cost reducing effect of  the
auction process.  In either case, the plan would reduce interstate
long-distance prices substantially and generate billions in consumer
welfare and promote the development of new technology.  
<P>
 <B>b. <I>Targeted aid to the needy. </I></B> The second component
of the Federal Universal Service Plan is to target aid to low-income
users to assure that telephone service remains affordable for
all.  The OC will advise Congress within 180 days after enactment
on how best to perform this function. Possibilities include funding
means tested waivers for installation charges, deposits and the
federal universal service subscriber line charge.  Each year the
low-income subsidy would be recovered as an explicit component
of the monthly universal service subscriber charge.  As the high-cost
fund is ramped down, only a small portion of the savings would
be needed to fund this second component of the federal subscriber
line charge.
<P>
 By targeting assistance to low income households, the Federal
Universal Service Plan would be more fair and less expensive.
 It would also be more effective in raising telephone penetration
rates among the poor, because installation charges and deposits
are widely believed to represent larger obstacles to telephone
subscribership than does the monthly cost of telephone access.
<P>
 It should also be noted that the lower long-distance rates under
the Federal Universal Service Plan would be beneficial to many
rural households.  Rural callers make more long distance calls
on average than do urban customers.   Also, one study found that
low-income (life-line) customers in one state paid more than 60
percent of their monthly bill for long-distance services.
<P>
 The administration of the universal service subscriber line is
envisioned as being administered by a private organization such
as the National Exchange Carriers Association.  All other existing
subsidy programs either would be funded by the Federal Universal
Service Plan or  eliminated.  All local exchange carriers would
provide itemized billing of the universal service subscriber line
charges with brief accompanying explanations. 
<P>
<B> c.  <I>Devolution of the Remaining Subsidies Back to the States.
</I></B> Within 180 days after enactment, the OC will determine
best how to return those interstate costs not covered by the plan
 to the individual states.  States will have broad flexibility
to recover these costs as they deem fit, subject to general federal
guidelines.  The essential federal guideline in this regard is
the &quot;most favored nation&quot; approach, which would prohibit
State regulators from discriminating against interstate users
when pricing access to local exchange facilities.  A strict MFN
approach is designed to promote interstate commerce.   Moreover,
the Replacement Model assumes elimination of all legal barriers
to entry in local telephony markets and pre-emption of all state
public utility regulation of  wireless carriers.  Additionally,
the OC could be required to calculate an appropriate national
access cap below which all states would have to price interstate
access.  This one time cap would be set to reflect that portion
of interstate costs that are recovered by the universal service
subscriber line charge. 
<P>
 States will nevertheless retain the flexibility to adopt additional
universal service policies.  Nothing here will limit the ability
of the states to formulate universal service policies beyond those
expressly provided for in the federal universal service subscriber
line charge.  For example, the states may maintain residential
rates at or below the national average or expand the definition
of services covered under universal service.

<h2>The Telecommunications Revolution</h2>

<hr width="50%">
<h2>2.2  The Replacement Model's Option Two: Full Devolution</h2>
</center><blockquote>

<P>

This alternative model also emphasizes transition, not maintenance,
and explicit, not implicit subsidies.  In contrast to the Federal
Universal Service Plan, however, it transfers the full responsibility
for universal service back to the states. 
<P>
 <B>a. <I>Transition, not maintenance.</I></B> Due regard for
transitional inequities is appropriate. Where changes are contemplated
in regulation for the purpose of benefiting society as a whole,
the full cost of such change should not be visited on one single
group.  Due regard for transitional inequities should not be converted
into creating long-term maintenance programs.  
<P>
 In 1977, Senator Ernest Hollings, then-Chairman of the Senate
Communications Subcommittee, proposed a program which would have
essentially frozen both the total amount of subsidy dollars and
those eligible to receive them.  Support payments would have been
made in aid of ensuring a single party, Touch-tone service with
access to 911 emergency services, but not the full range of options
available. Such services could be purchased, of course, but not
at subsidized prices.
<P>
 A comparable approach today would entail freezing the size of
the five NECA-administered support funds (an initiative that the
FCC has, in part, already undertaken).  Alternatively, a freeze
coupled with an automatic reduction over the next decade -- say,
10 percent a year -- could be put in place.  Again, the objective
would be to safeguard legitimate transactional inequities while
at the same time encouraging efficiencies and to take into account
the lower cost options and technologies.   
<P>
 <B>b. <I>Implicit to Explicit.  </I></B>Most support payments
are buried in telephone company FCC and state-filed tariffs, with
the result that the magnitude and direction of subsidies is at
best disputable, and there is scant accountability.  Congress,
under this full devolution plan, would direct the OC promptly
to discern and make public the magnitude and direction of telephone
industry price support programs.  In effect, a &quot;subsidy budget&quot;
would be established, much as a &quot;burden hours budget&quot;
is required in conjunction with Federal paperwork reduction measures.
 To quote Justice Brandeis, &quot;Sunshine is the best disinfectant.&quot;
 
<P>
 <B>c.  <I>Devolution. </I></B> Then, the full responsibility
to devise and administer residential telephone price support programs
for today's implicit subsidies should be transferred from Washington
to the states.  States would  have the responsibility to regulate
the price charged for access to and from that state.  Several
mechanisms exist for generating funds necessary to meet a pre-determined
State &quot;universal service&quot; budget.  Assume, for example,
Tennessee were to determine that, next year, $250 million is needed
to cover its local exchange carrier's costs and maintain the status
quo -- $200 million to subsidize residential rates and $50 million
to provide nearly free &quot;lifeline&quot; services to the truly
needy.  Tennessee would have the flexibility to determine the
charges levied by local phone companies in conjunction with the
origin and termination of intra- as well as interstate calls.
  State authorities might choose to raise access charges in order
to meet a clearly defined societal purpose.  Alternatively, those
authorities might choose sharply to reduce access charges to make
the state more competitive with peers for attracting and retaining
investment and jobs.  
<P>
 This approach would give states new responsibilities subject
to a federal interest in promoting interstate commerce.  The states
would still be required to meet MFN non-discrimination requirements
noted above.  Elements of this approach exist in certain FCC-administered
programs today.   The outlines of  state-sanctioned &quot;lifeline&quot;
programs are nominally subject to local option and legislative
endorsement.  State authorities traditionally have been left with
the option of defining what constitutes &quot;universal service.&quot;
  Instead of being bit-players in a system largely administered
through Washington, here states would have the primary responsibility.
<P>
 This approach would also give states broader latitude for experimentation,
subject to the limitations imposed by their competing for commerce
and industry.  The communications component of business enterprise
has nearly doubled over the past 10 years.  States know this and
are aware of the impact on their competitiveness should they hike
phone charges significantly.  The top 10 largest states in the
country today account for more than two-thirds of the total &quot;telephone
economy&quot; and for the preponderance of long distance calling.
 
<P>
 States also could be required to meet the MFN non-discrimination
requirement noted above.  This would give states new responsibilities
and opportunities to experiment and control their destiny subject
to a federal interest in promoting interstate commerce.

<h2>PART THREE:
VOLUNTARY RE-ALLOCATION OF RADIO</h2>
</center><blockquote>

<P>
 The Replacement Model implements a pro-competition, anti-monopoly
regime which will not protect incumbent companies by placing the
onus on new entrants to the market to justify themselves.   New
wireless service providers will have a presumptive right to compete.
 The Replacement Model envisions that government's role will be
dedicated to providing an orderly entry-way for the robust forces
of competitive rivalry, as well as safeguards to ensure the continued
vitality of market competition.
<P>
<B>1.</B> <I><B>Spectrum defined.  </B></I>The radio spectrum
-- generally defined as the range of electromagnetic frequencies
between three kilohertz and 300 gigahertz -- is  one of the Nation's
most valuable economic resources.  Television and radio broadcasting,
cellular telephone communications, paging and messaging, satellite
services, point-to-point microwave and taxi dispatching -- all
use spectrum.
<P>
 The use of spectrum as a resource is largely determined through
administrative allocation and licensing procedures first developed
in the 1920s.  Under this system, the federal government determines
the general uses for the radio spectrum, allocates bands of frequencies
to each of those uses, and then assigns licenses to specific users.
 This system involves a large degree of central planning by federal
regulators.   The FCC today determines which services are to be
provided, the frequencies on which they will be provided, the
conditions under which they will be provided, and the technology
to be used. 
<P>
<B>2. </B><I> <B>The Replacement Alternative: A  Property Rights
Approach to Spectrum.  </B></I> As far back as 1959, Nobel-laureate
economist Ronald Coase proposed that property rights be accorded
to radio licenses, that license owners pay for the right to use
spectrum, and that bidding for that right was the most efficient
way to allocate spectrum.  Privatizing spectrum would eliminate
the years current applicants must wait to provide new services,
permit market forces to move spectrum to its highest valued use,
and greatly reduce spectrum scarcity, unleashing a raft of new
wireless technologies.
<P>
 In 1991, NTIA studied the idea, reviewed the considerable literature
and past proposals on the subject, and concluded that a &quot;market-based
system for spectrum management would improve considerably the
efficiency and fairness of the current U.S. system, and, if properly
designed and implemented, can fully address concerns about such
issues as competitive equity, spectrum 'warehousing,' and the
preservation of socially-desirable services.&quot;  As part of
its recommendation, NTIA supported private transfers and subleasing
of spectrum rights directly from one user to another.
<P>
 All of this is administratively feasible.  Spectrum is already
bought and sold, although only in the secondary market.  New Zealand
has already liberalized significant bands of  spectrum already.
 In 1927, Congress -- persuaded by incumbent broadcasters -- to
establish a &quot;public interest&quot; licensing scheme.  That
system served the interests of incumbents well, short-circuiting
competitive forces from almost the very beginning.  America can
now correct this mistake.
<P>
 The Replacement Model presumes that new companies, new services
and new ideas have a presumptive right to access spectrum with
non-interfering use.  New entrants are encouraged to invade existing
markets and compete.  New and existing users have the right to
compete freely without &quot;public interest&quot; restrictions,
thereby lowering prices, increasing consumer choices, and expanding
services.  <HR>

</PRE>
<HR>

<P>
<B></B> As this chart indicates, the U.S. government is the prime
holder of spectrum in the 30,000 megaHertz  to 300 gigaHertz range.
 Spectrum is used for a wide variety of critical law enforcement,
national defense, and other important needs.  Nevertheless, large
portions of the spectrum go unutilized or vastly under utilized,
and many of the wasted bands are under the control of the federal
government.  The Replacement Model, as discussed below, encourages
through incentives the government to privatize this spectrum.
 In addition, Congress may well wish more direct and explicit
 means of ensuring this resource is used more efficiently, as
it has in the past -- as when it recently re-assigned 220 Mhz.
in the emerging technologies band from the federal government
to the private sector.  
<P>
 Auctions are an efficient way to assign rights.  The objective
is not to generate funds for the U.S. government.  Indeed, the
objective of the auction approach stressed below is to reduce
scarcity values which are currently associated with spectrum licensing
and use.  Nonetheless, it is currently estimated by all, including
the FCC itself, that auctions will generate billions in direct
proceeds over five years.  This sum, while substantial, will pale
compared to the economic growth, new jobs, new companies, new
products and consumer saving that will accompany the more efficient,
market-oriented use of spectrum.
<P>
<B>3. </B> <I><B>The current standard is hostile to consumers.
 </B></I>The centerpiece of the 1934 Act is a &quot;Public Interest
Standard&quot; which came into being first with the 1927 Radio
Act.  The Public Interest Standard was requested by David Sarnoff
and incumbent radio broadcasters so government would have a legal
basis to deny licenses to newcomers.  Senator C.C. Dill, the author
of the both the 1927 Radio Act and the 1934 Act, liked the standard
because it permitted policymakers (such as himself) political
discretion to shape the marketplace.  Dill subsequently wrote
that political control was important because common law was rapidly
shaping spectrum access rights as private property.  The public
interest standard, in practice, allows regulators to stop decentralized
development and to engage in both industrial policy and political
handicapping.
<P>
<B>4.</B> <I><B>&quot;Public interest&quot; cannot be defined.
 </B></I>Today there is still no effective definition of the &quot;public
interest&quot; standard.  In 1993, Commissioner Duggan attacked
critics of the FCC and the public interest standard -- claiming
the FCC indeed, could define it.  That this debate was still occurring
almost sixty years after the concept was promulgated makes the
point cogently.  In effect, the public interest standard is exactly
whatever three of the five FCC members say it is. Nothing is ruled
out.
<P>
<B>5.</B>   <I><B>The Replacement Plan</B></I><B>. <I> </I></B>The
Replacement Model sequences reforms to give markets and competitors
time to make rational decisions based upon market information.
 Phase One can be completed soon after enactment.  All current
license-holders of spectrum are granted a complete fee simple
in their spectrum -- the title to use, sell, lease or transfer
as they deem fit, subject only to interference and antitrust concerns.
 A one time registration fee can be assessed to help fund the
replacement model's title registry service of the spectrum.
<P>
 Phase Two contemplates expediting all exclusive applications
pending before the FCC for spectrum licenses as of May 1, 1995
(as a representative date).  These applications, upon completion
of geographic, power and location contour analysis, will be promptly
converted to property rights of the applicant to the spectrum.
 Competing applications will be subject to auction.
<P>
 Phase Three would open up all unallocated (non-government) spectrum
for application.  This process would facilitate entry by surveying
available spectrum bands (all those where entry is currently feasible)
and establish standardized parcels for new entrants to claim.
 Such a survey function is designed solely to promote consumer
welfare by encouraging competition and is not to block off spectrum
&quot;for reserves.&quot;  For spectrum frequencies in which there
are more than one claim asserted, the model mandates that the
government auction the new bands within 180 days.  As much as
efficient, the new Office of Communications should permit market
forces, subject to antitrust review, to determine the geographic
and interference boundaries of the initial property assignments.
 The FCC's current experience in creating  &quot;overlay rights&quot;
for PCS licensees should be a valuable guide in this process.
<P>
 The premise is that spectrum use will be dictated by the American
people, not the government.  The model allows for &quot;spectrum
contours,&quot; &quot;overlay rights&quot; and &quot;band management
rights&quot; to be defined quickly by the government and made
available to investors willing to risk capital in developing new
wireless services.  Auctions will be mandatory when more than
one entity registers for use of spectrum under a defined and short
timeframe.  The process encourages competition amongst potential
users to establish new wireless services, triggering a discovery
process which will usher in dynamic application of cutting-edge
technology.  These auctions will sell property, not licenses.
 Those who bid and win title are free to develop and/or re-sell
the spectrum as with any other private property right subject
to antitrust review and geographic and  interference boundaries.

<P>
 Under Phase Four, unallocated spectrum held in reserve by the
government would be opened for use by the private sector as applicants
see fit.  Spectrum bands currently reserved for government use
would be made available for private users through direction the
of  Congress.  The federal government owns the vast majority of
 &quot;clean&quot; spectrum -- spectrum which is not in use. 
Phase Four envisions that those government agencies with a claim
to spectrum will disgorge their unused spectrum within a determined
timeframe.  New companies and new services are encouraged to establish
new wireless services -- triggering a process of discovery as
new technologies are tried and used.  
<P>
 When more than one private party registers for use of the same
parcel of spectrum, an auction will be held.  Current entities
such as the Department of Defense and NASA will be permitted to
retain a portion of the proceeds from spectrum roll-out for modernizing,
re-location expenses and operational uses.  Although it can be
expected that certain departments will resort to &quot;national
security&quot; arguments to not only maintain but possibly expand
their claim to spectrum use, Congress is encouraged to view such
assertions skeptically.  Much of government's use of spectrum
is inefficient, with competing elements within a single bureaucracy
refusing to share spectrum for narrow, internal rivalries or other
reasons.  Any claim to &quot;national security&quot; should be
justified with full inquiry by Congress into the validity of the
claim and whether more efficient means can be found to accomplish
the asserted mission.
<P>
 Auctions will be held within a specified deadline time of 180
days.  This approach would account for transaction costs to the
extent they are a significant obstacle to the aggregation of spectrum
where that might be efficient.  
<P>
<B>6.</B> <I><B>The property rights model is supported by courts
and common law.  </B></I>The model encourages both new competitors
and existing licensees to push the process forward from below.
 This reform is not a descendant from the edict of a civil servant
from above.  Not even interference rights should be set forth
in detail in new legislation.  The model instead broadly defines
what new competitors are entitled to do, and offers spectrum users
the opportunity to fulfill their market-driven aspirations.  The
government remains involved to protect the marketplace <I>via
</I>antitrust and property law.
<P>
 <I><B>Conclusion.</B></I>  The Replacement Model is predicated
upon a fundamental re-appraisal of the rationale and validity
of the current &quot;public interest&quot; approach to spectrum
management.  The model is premised on a new standard to gain economic
benefits from the efficiency of a competitive market: &quot;consumer
welfare.&quot;  Government action will be explicitly designed
to promote the economic choices for the American consumer,  with
lower prices, improved selection, and better, more innovative
services.
<P>
 The legal content for this standard draws from the spirit of
competition embedded in over 120 years of  antitrust law.  More
importantly, it is a clean break with the industrial policy of
the central planners,  representing a series of almost unbroken
failures over the past seven decades.

<h2>The Telecommunications Revolution</h2>
<h3>An American Opportunity</h3>
<hr width="50%">
<h2>PART FOUR: THE REPLACEMENT MODEL</h2>
</center><blockquote>

<P>
<I><B> A clean sheet approach. </B></I> The Replacement Model
adopts a  clean sheet approach to the government's role in the
knowledge age.  The model addresses the  four critical functions
that should be performed regardless of  era or technology.  First,
government should establish, protect and enforce a system of 
property rights, tangible and intangible.  The central task of
government is to protect individual rights  and formulate the
laws by which the rights are adjudicated.  Government should also
define the application of individual rights to a particular sphere
of activity.  Clarity is essential.  Ambiguous property rights
are an invitation to litigation, diverting energy and creativity
into lawsuits that serve no customers nor generate no new wealth.
 
<P>
  Second,  the government should promote market efficiency and
competition by policing market break down.  Since the 1934 Act,
technological progress is turning the telecommunications marketplace
from one characterized as &quot;economies of scale&quot; and &quot;natural
monopolies&quot; into a competitive market.  While government
can assist industry when possible through cooperative efforts
to promote standards and technical guidelines, in general, competition
has made whole areas of FCC central planning, such as broadcast,
cable and long distance regulation unnecessary and costly.  These
regulations should be eliminated immediately.  
<P>
 Third, where government supervision is called for it will frequently
be best done through antitrust enforcement.  Antitrust law is
designed to prevent acts and practices that can lead to the creation
of new monopolies, or harm consumers by forcing up prices, limiting
access to competing products or reducing service quality.  For
more than 120 years, America has relied upon antitrust law to
foster competition and ensure that all compete fairly and by the
same rules.  Telecommunications is such a market --  telephone,
cable, satellite, wireless -- all are seeking to compete.  The
implication is that the price-and-entry regulation of the 1934
Act should therefore be replaced by antitrust law as quickly as
possible.
<P>
 Fourth, many of the remaining necessary governmental functions
in telecommunications should be transferred to the states with
appropriate federal guidelines, as well as to other federal agencies
with expertise.  For example, most regulation of local exchange
facilities could be returned to the states which already regulate
75 percent of these costs.  Where appropriate, federal interests
regarding local telephony could be transferred to the proposed
new Office of Communications in an existing agency in the Executive
Branch.
<P>
<B>B.  A Functional Re-Assignment of  FCC Responsibilities Under
The 1934 Act. </B>
<P>
     The following is a suggested roadmap for analyzing the salient
 provisions in Title 47  by function in accordance with a modern
approach to telecommunications.  In general, the analysis  corresponds
to the five operational bureaus of the Commission:  common carriage,
mass media, wireless, cable and international/satellite (a functional
organization not coincidentally mirroring the limits and functions
of analog technology).  
<P>
      Many statutory provisions and FCC rules and regulations
can be eliminated immediately upon enactment of  the  replacement
law. Some provisions can be phased out over time. Others, however,
need to be retained and their enforcement transferred elsewhere.
 Unless indicated otherwise, all FCC statutory authority and FCC
rules and regulations will be sunsetted within three years of
the FCC replacement law.

<h2>The Telecommunications Revolution</h2>
<h3>An American Opportunity</h3>
<hr width="50%">
<h2>4.1a  The New Office Of Communications</h2>
</center><blockquote>

<P>
 The edifice government created sixty years ago drastically needs
an update and facelift to match the realities of contemporary
technologies. The replacement for the FCC is the Office of Communications
(&quot;OC&quot;).  The OC will oversee a telecommunications industry
based on the proposition that a digital transmission can not be
characterized by differentiating regulations based on function.
 A digital transmission of 1s and 0s can be transmitted by and
received through any variety of means -- twisted pair, cable,
wireless, video dialtone or satellite.
<P>
 The OC will consist of far fewer than the approximately 2,200
current federal bureaucrats.  It will reside largely in an Executive
Branch agency.  Placing the OC within a consolidated niche within
the Executive Branch should have <B>no </B>impact whatsoever on
the integrity or independence of decision-making.  At present,
the National Transportation Safety Board and the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission are both parts of Executive departments.
 There has not been any indication that these arrangements impaired
independence or generated undue political influence.  
<P>
 The OC would assume the following functions:  oversee for a transition
period the remaining federal responsibilities to regulate interstate
access to local exchange facilities, coordinate the privatization
of the spectrum, and prepare for Congress a phase out plan for
all FCC rules and regulations which will be sunsetted in three
years (except as noted below).
<P>
 First, the OC will: (a) monitor interconnection requirements
under Section 201 of the 1934 Act consistent with the federal
guidelines against discriminatory pricing, with enforcement under
the jurisdiction of the Justice Department; (b) monitor compliance
with hearing-impaired and speech-impaired requirements under Section
225 of the 1934 Act with enforcement under the Department of Justice
civil division; (c) monitor uses of telephone communication for
harassing calls or prohibited commercial purposes; and (d) implement
the universal service plan and federal responsibilities to monitor
and facilitate the development of local competition created by
legislation terminating the MFJ. 
<P>
 Second, the OC will also coordinate the transfer and privatization
of spectrum.  It will consist of the frequency coordinator role
of the current FCC and the NTIA, which currently chairs the &quot;Interdepartmental
Radio Advisory Committee,&quot; established in 1922 by then-Commerce
Secretary Herbert Hoover. The OC will establish and run the Spectrum
Registry File (&quot;SRF&quot;).  The SRF will be the resource
to keep track of centralized registration of spectrum.  
<P>
 Under the plan to privatize spectrum, all current licensees of
spectrum will be granted title in the spectrum.  A deed to the
spectrum will be filed with the SRF.  All new spectrum to be auctioned
will be registered with the SRF as well.  
<P>
 Currently,  all engineering, screening and approval of applications
of  &quot;private radio&quot; -- commercial mobile radio service
-- is handled by &quot;frequency coordinators.&quot;  These are
private entities such as the National Association of Business
and Educational Radio (&quot;NABER&quot;), the Associated Public
Safety Communications Officers (&quot;APCO&quot;), etc.  These
user groups perform most of the functions that the government
staffs at one time undertook.  The frequency coordination process
has worked well, and paid important dividends in terms of speed,
flexibility and reduced tax payer costs.   
<P>
 The OC will harness this system and work with the private sector
and industry associations to perform for broadcast and other forms
of spectrum use what NABER and APCO do currently for private radio.
 An important result would be to speed up title issues with respect
to spectrum.  The OC, as the FCC does today, will retain ultimate
authority.  But a large volume of the engineering &quot;sweat
work&quot; will be delegated. 
<P>
 The OC will prepare within one year a phase out plan for all
FCC rules and regulations which will be sunsetted except in the
event that Congress affirmatively acts to preserve the regulation
in the interest of competition.  The OC will also make recommendations
for the efficient phasing-out of other FCC regulations should
the three-year sunset create transitional problems.  A critical
component of the OC's work will be to document instances where
safety or substantial market failure would make continuation of
any sunsetted regulation beneficial to consumers.   Unless Congress
acts before the sunset date, all designated FCC rules and regulations
will be rescinded on that date. 
<P>
<B> </B>The OC will reverse the massive grant of power given to
the FCC under Title II of the 1934 Act.  Previously, pursuant
to the 1934 Act, the FCC controlled rates for common carriers,
investigated existing ones and  determined new ones.  The FCC
controlled which companies compete, where and under what corporate
structures. The OC will supervise the transition back to the market.
 It will develop and implement the universal service plan on a
transitional basis with a finite sunset provision for non-needs-based
subsidies.  The OC will also supervise on a temporary basis the
availability of interstate access on a non-discriminatory basis
to local exchange facilities.
<P>
<B> </B>The OC will also roll back government impositions under
Title III of the Act.  All existing broadcast stations are presumed
to face effective competition.  The OC model returns cable TV
to the 1984 Cable Act.
<P>
 The OC model makes a break with the Cable Act of 1984, however,
by repealing the grant to the FCC to regulate cross-ownership
of cable and exclude telephone companies from cable programming.
 The FCC authorized state and local authorities to regulate cable
rates as well as set technical standards.  Federal law pre-empted
local attempts to require cable systems to operate as common carriers
or utilities.  The legislation, however, expressly barred new
FCC regulation of content on cable programming.  The new standard
for effective competition will be the original 3 over-the-air
signal standard promulgated by the FCC.  Local cable regulation
is pre-empted.
<P>
 The goal, as indicated at the outset of the Report, is to fashion
a new, modern governmental approach to telecommunications supportive
of and in harmony with the realities of the technological changes
over the past 60 years.  Government has a role to play in the
information age.  But that new, modern role has no basis in the
1930s and the values and technological limits of that era.

<center><h2>Preserve, Protect, and Defend<br>

Constitutional Principles I Promise to Uphold</h3>



By <a href="#dole">Bob Dole</a>, <a href="#gramm">Phil Gramm</a>, <a href="#lugar">Dick Lugar</a>, <a href="#lamar">Lamar Alexander</a> & <a href="#dornan">Robert Dornan</a>

<p><b><i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</b><br>

                                  January-February 1996, Number 75</I>

</center><p>

	The first act of an incoming president is to "solemnly swear (or affirm)" that he will "preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States."  In judging prospective candidates for the presidency, it is therefore important to examine whether they interpret the Constitution properly. To help voters with this determination, <i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i> asked the following question of the principal presidential candidates still running as of November 1995: "Which parts of the Constitution are commonly misinterpreted or underappreciated, and therefore deserve more emphasis in political discourse?" We publish responses from Senators Bob Dole, Phil Gramm, and Dick Lugar; Governor Lamar Alexander, and Representative Robert Dornan. (President Bill Clinton, Patrick Buchanan, Steve Forbes, and Alan Keyes were invited to participate but did not respond by our deadline.) 
<p><hr><p>


<a name="dole"></a><b>Senator Bob Dole</b><br>
<i>The Establishment Clause</i><br>
<a href="http://www.dole96.com">Dole for President Home Page</a><p>
	Perhaps no provision of the Constitution is more misunderstood today than the First Amendment as it applies to religion.
<p>

	The most basic misunderstanding is that the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment demands that any reference to religion must be absolutely cleansed from our schools and other public institutions. A second misunderstanding is that anyone who wants our public institutions to show more respect for the religious faith of the American people is really plotting to impose a particular religious viewpoint on those with different beliefs.

<p>	A good part of the blame for this confusion lies with the Supreme Court of the United States. Years ago, the Court cast aside the original meaning of the First Amendment's Establishment Clause, which forbids the establishment of an official state religion or policies favoring one religion over another. In its place, the Court has erected a variety of confusing formulas -- the Lemon test, the endorsement test, and others -- that invoke the Constitution to support the proposition that religion must be purged from public life. Using such tests, the Supreme Court has banned the display of the Ten Commandments in any public school, even for educational purposes.


<p>
	Unfortunately, misguided school administrators and teachers in some areas of the country have also wrongly embraced the idea that all references to religion in school settings are unconstitutional. Among the results of this misreading of the First Amendment:

<p><ul>

<li>Teachers have been disciplined for wearing a cross as personal jewelry and for reading their own Bible during break periods.<p>

<li>Two Texas third-graders were prohibited from wearing T-shirts depicting Jesus -- though Power Rangers and Barney were just fine.

<p>


<li>Many communities have banned holiday crche displays from public buildings and parks, even where 
they have been set up by private civic groups.


<p>

<li>Some schools have banned religious songs at choir concerts, as well as Christmas carols, and even Christmas trees.
<P>

<li>Students have been told they may not talk about God to classmates, and teachers have rejected religious artwork and reports on "my hero" where the students took the politically incorrect decision to write about Jesus.
</ul><p>


	In fact, studies by the National Institute of Education, People for the American Way, and Americans United for the Separation of Church and State have all confirmed that references to religion's role in American life and history have been systematically stripped from textbooks and curricula.
<p>

	A fair reading of the historical record, however, shows that the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment was designed to protect religious liberty, not strip religious expression from all public institutions. As Professor Stephen Carter writes: "[T]he metaphorical separation of church and state originated in an effort to protect religion from the state, not the state from religion. The religion clauses of the First Amendment were crafted to permit maximum freedom to the religious."

<p>	After all, it was the first Congress -- which passed the Bill of Rights and sent it for ratification to the states -- that opened each day's session with a prayer led by a chaplain. This practice continues today. And 24 hours after it voted in favor of what is now the First Amendment, the Congress considered a resolution proclaiming a national day of thanksgiving. Indeed, if the Supreme Court itself really adhered to the view that the government must divorce itself from religion, then it would not open every one of its sessions with the appeal, "God save the United States and this Honorable Court."

<p>	There are some hopeful signs that the confusion surrounding the First Amendment's Establishment Clause is now beginning to clear up. Earlier this year, in a close, 5-to-4 decision, the Supreme Court rejected the argument that a public university can deny funding to a Christian student newspaper while financing student publications generally. It now appears that there are at least five justices who believe that religious expression is entitled to the same constitutional protection as other forms of expression.

<p>	To say that our public institutions should accommodate religious speech is not to say that the state should impose official prayers and punish students who do not participate. That's certainly not my position. Nor is it the position of Jay Sekulow, Pat Robertson's counsel at the American Center for Law and Justice, who has said, "We don't want to see a return to the pre-1962 situation, with a teacher leading a class i
n prayer."

<p>	At the same time, we simply do not accept the view that the Constitution commands that religion be erased from whatever government touches. This view misreads the First Amendment and distorts history.

<a name="gramm"></a><b>Senator Phil Gramm</b><br>
<i>The Takings Clause</i><br>
<a href="http://www.gramm96.org">Phil Gramm for President Home Page</a>

<p>
	When considering the most "underappreciated" element of the Constitution, anyone who sees what is going on everyday across this country as I do will respond immediately, "the Fifth Amendment." Well known for its protection against self-incrimination, the Fifth Amendment also contains a clause that protects private property, a building block of the American foundation. The Takings Clause is a quintessential constitutional shield, artfully and specifically rejecting the idea that government officials can seize property without compensation, regardless of what public good they intend to accomplish.

<p>	Unfortunately, we are facing a threat to the right to own property that our Founding Fathers could never have imagined. In America in 1995, two consenting adults can engage in any kind of consensual behavior with total constitutional protection -- except owning private property  and engaging in commerce and business. Over and over again -- every day all across America -- people are having their private property taken without compensation -- by way of the Endangered Species Act, wetlands regulation, and a host of other "regulatory takings." Property values are being reduced and land is effectively being taken to promote objectives that society considers good, but for which society refuses to pay. In fact, we have a president today whose interior secretary has suggested that private property may even be outdated in the modern world!

<p>

	If government takes your property or restricts its use, you should be compensated. On this issue there can be no compromise. Private property is the foundation of our freedom, and I will defend it as vigorously as the freedom of speech and freedom of religion. As president, I will work hard to protect private-property rights and to bring the Fifth Amendment back into the family of the Bill of Rights on behalf of the people who own property, till the soil, and produce the goods and services in our country.

<p>	The most pressing constitutional issue facing our nation, however, involves a matter not actually enshrined in that great document. I am referring to the need for a Balanced Budget Amendment. I introduced a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution on my first day in Congress and have worked hard to pass it ever since. But, as surprising as it may be to some of my colleagues, this debate did not begin with my tenure in Congress.

<p>	Through the course of American history, we have amended our Constitution 27 times, but haven't yet had the political will to fix the only thing Thomas Jefferson found wrong with the document. Jefferson was this country's Minister to France during the writing of the Constitution, and when he was first shown the document, he had a proposal for one change. In a subsequent letter to John Taylor, Jefferson recorded that proposal:

<p>	"I wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to our Constitution. I would be willing to depend on that alone for the reduction of the administration of our government to the genuine principles of its Constitution. I mean an additional article taking from the government the power of borrowing."

<p>	So the present controversy is not just a debate over a balanced budget amendment, but a debate on the Jefferson amendment. It is also a debate about the future of America and a potential seed of its destruction. We need a contract between the government and the people that binds Congress with a chain that cannot be broken. The genius of the Const
itution is that it rules out of bounds actions that the people have determined that they do not want Congress to take. Read the first words from the Bill of Rights in our Constitution: "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for redress of grievances."

<p>	The American people were clear about the grievances they wanted redressed in November 1994. In the most decisive election since 1932, the people said to their government, "Stop the taxing. Stop the spending. Stop the regulating." To do that, they supported the Contract With America, a key element of which is a balanced budget amendment. But we haven't given the people what they want yet. We have not fulfilled a promise we made.

<p>	The Constitution was written because people did not trust the government. With Congress's failure to honor its promises, act responsibly, and be accountable for its actions, there is much for the people not to trust.

<a name="lugar"></a><b>Senator Dick Lugar</b><br>
<i>Enumerated Powers</i>
<br>
<a href="http://www.iquest.net/lugar/lugar.html">Lugar for President Home Page</a>
<p>
	Virtually every clause in the Constitution has been used -- even tortured -- to justify a variety of causes. What deserves more emphasis in political discourse, however, is the spirit of what the Constitution set out to do generally: to assign to the federal government specific tasks and the powers to carry them out, and to reserve all else to the states or the people. This intent is most clearly articulated in the Ninth and Tenth Amendments of the Constitution.


<p>
	The aim of the Constitution's Framers was clear enough: to create a strong, but limited, national government. Having first decided to omit a list of specific limits (or "negatives," as the Framers called them) on the national government's authority, the Framers then agreed in principle to accept them as the first amendments to the new Constitution. The first eight amendments impose specific limits on the power of government, both at the national and state levels. All serve the same end: restricting the scope and power of government. Lest there be any ambiguity, the Ninth Amendment makes clear the presumption that rights belong to the people: "The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people." And the Tenth Amendment makes clear the boundaries that this places on the national government: "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."

<p>	In a way, it might be said that these provisions were not so much "amendments" to the Constitution -- in the sense of replacing existing provisions or adding new features -- as clarifications of the Constitution's underlying intent. The Framers were no libertarians; they set out to create a strong national government with powers sufficiently robust to accomplish its functions. This is especially true in the realm of national security, where powers are largely reserved to the national government. That which the federal government should do, the Framers believed, it should do well.

<p>
	But that which the federal government should not do and cannot do well, it should not do at all. The modern departure from this philosophy is largely responsible for the lack of confidence that Americans now express about their government. As the national government has expanded its reach into virtually every sphere of Americans' lives, it should not be surprising that the volatility of voter preferences and discontent with government have increased. The passions of individuals and groups are inflamed on all sides of issues that are not properly within the sphere of the federal government.

<p>	Take the recent debate over funding formulas and federal "strings" on welfare block grants. It is well and good that states and localities should administer their own social welfare programs. They are closer to the people and, on the whole, they will do a better job than the federal government. This is surely consistent with the intent of the Framers.

<p>	But why should the federal government be the tax collector for the states' programs? Why, for example, should citizens of Iowa or New Hampshire or any other state send their money to Washington, only to have it returned -- after bitter fights over allocation formulas and conditionsto run their own programs? Wouldn't it make more sense for states to raise the funds to pay for the programs they establish?


<p>
	In this regard, I have proposed to eliminate the federal income tax (and the 16th Amendment, which makes it possible) and replace it with a national sales tax collected by the states. National and state sales taxes can coexist perfectly well and, after a brief time, are likely to come into conformity with one another. Once this occurs, the federal government could reduce its sales tax, and allow the states to raise the funds for their own programs. Gone would be monetary transfers to Washington; gone would be formula fights; and gone would be federal strings. And limited federal government would be here to stay.

<p>	The Ninth and Tenth Amendments to the Constitution offer much needed guidance. If we were to ask whether each new proposed program, as well as many existing programs, represent legitimate tasks of the federal government, our answer would often be "no," and we could start to fashion a more efficient federal government. We would also discover that properly limiting federal government would raise its public standing commensurately.

<p>	In speaking of the amendment process, James Madison says in The Federalist No.49, "As every appeal to the people would carry an implication of some defect in the government, frequent appeals would, in great measure, deprive the government of that veneration which time bestows on everything." A society that appeals to its national government to attend to all things -- including those for which it is not suited -- will find that that same government loses the veneration of the people in political discourse. That cannot be the goal of true friends of limited government.
<p>

<a name="lamar"></a><b>Lamar Alexander</b><br>
<i>Presidential Powers</i><br>
<a href="http://www.Nashville.Net/~lamar">Alexander for President Home Page</a><p>

	One section of our Constitution distinguishes the United States from virtually all other countries: Article II, the description of the role and powers of the president. The president is the only figure in our government whose oath of office is actually written in the Constitution. He is the only person who is elected by and represents all of the people. Yet, today, it is the president whose power and authority is most in decline.

<p>	The reasons for the decline are obvious. Even at the outset of his administration, when Bill Clinton's own party controlled both Houses of Congress, nearly all his actions undermined the strength of the presidency. He has retreated from campaign promises (the middle-class tax cut, a balanced budget), sown disaffection among his own supporters (gays in the military, health-care reform), dragged the White House into embarrassing scandals (Travelgate, Whitewater), and zigged and zagged on foreign policy (Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia).

<p>	But the presidency has also suffered from the rise of the legislative branch, especially since the elections of November 1994. This development is unusual. While the Congress has often had energetic leaders, it is rare in the modern era to see the national agenda set by the legislative branch rather than the executive.

<p>	Setting the national agenda may be the single most important function of a president. A strong president is someone who can focus on the two or three most urgent needs facing our country, develop a strategy to deal with them, and then convince at least half the country he's right. President Carter, by contrast, tried to involve himself in virtually every policy matter. President Clinton has done the same. The result has been an unfocused, and consequently weak, presidency. I am convinced that much of Ronald Reagan's effectiveness as president came from having three clear goals -- lower taxes, less government, and strong defense -- and spending all eight years of his presidency pursuing them.


<p>
	A careful reading of the Constitution shows that Article II provides the president with the tools to set the national agenda. He is the commander in chief and he is responsible for the conduct of the nation's foreign affairs. He can pick his own cabinet and appoint the chief officers of the government. He can select candidates for the federal bench. Through the careful use of the veto, he can reject whatever competing ideas the Congress tries to impose on the nation. All of these instruments of executive power can make for a strong president who helps chart the nation's course.

<p>	Again, President Clinton provides us with the best example of how the misuse of these powers leads to a weak executive. President Clinton's role as both commander-in-chief and the executive responsible for the conduct of foreign policy has done nothing to persuade America that there is a steady hand on the tiller. The result has been a Congress all-too-eager to usurp the president's prerogative in making foreign policy, whether it is in trade matters or the deployment of troops in Bosnia. A strong executive, as the Constitution implies, must make foreign policy, and resist congressional encroachments.

<p>	Our current situation is often ascribed to President Clinton's "inexperience" in foreign policy matters. Of course, it is not unusual for a president to arrive at the White House without a detailed knowledge of foreign affairs. But it is alarming to have a president who apparently doesn't know anyone else who does. Here we see President Clinton's ineffectual use of the power of appointment. The bureaucratic in-fighting among the State Department, Pentagon, and National Security Council personnel at the start of the Clinton presidency was a sign of the chief executive's inability to put together a first-class team that could work together. Joycelyn Elders and the series of bungled nominations at the Justice Department further eroded our confidence in the president's judgment. More recently, President Clinton's threats to veto a balanced budget amendment and the Republican Medicare plan seemed like pure political posturing rather than prudent use of executive power. These actions weakened both the president and the office of the presidency.

<p>	To be sure, there are many other aspects of our Constitution that receive too little notice: the Ninth and Tenth Amendments; the 22nd Amendment that created term limits for the president (the precedent for Congressional term limits); and the two alcohol amendments that tried to impose national legislation where local ordinances had proven more effective.
<p>
	But today we are on the brink of electing the first president of the next century. It would be worthwhile for all students of the Constitution -- not to mention all candidates for president -- to reexamine Article II. Used the way our Founders intended, Article II will help a strong, agenda-setting president committed to a limited central government achieve his goals.
<p>

<a name="dornan"></a><b>Representative Robert K. Dornan</b><br>
<i>"Government by Judiciary"</i>

<p>

	James Madison wrote that if "the sense in which the Constitution was accepted and ratified by the Nation . . . be not the guide in expounding it, there can be no security for a consistent and stable [government], more than for a faithful exercise of its powers." I couldn't agree more.

<p>	Seventy years of liberal activism, defined as opposing Madison's sentiment, have undone the original intent of the Framers. But no single point of judicial activism has done more harm to our nation than the doctrine of "incorporation"  in the Fourteenth Amendment of the Bill of Rights. In one fell swoop, the majesty and wisdom of the Tenth Amendment -- not to mention every doctrine of liberty upon which this nation of states was founded -- came crashing down.
<p>

	Our national penitence for the gross and evil sin of slavery has taken its toll on our every public institution. We fought a civil war, the bloodiest of all American wars, in large part to shed the physical chains of slavery protected by states' rights. We could have used surgically precise remedies to eventually bring closure to this historic tragedy without savaging the very liberties we insisted we were defending; instead we ignored the wisdom of our Founding Fathers and attempted a solution -- government by judiciary -- that fell way off the mark. In our earnest attempt to stop injustice from hiding behind the shield of states' rights, we threw the baby out with the bathwater. And, politics and power being what they are, "absorption" gave way to "incorporation."

<p>	Government by judiciary is perhaps the severest price our nation has paid for slavery. Through "incorporation" in the Fourteenth Amendment, the voice of the people (Congress and state and local governments) is patronized by "benevolent" judges, manipulated by strident ideologues, and mortgaged for generations by monied special interests. If the courts are, for all practical purposes, a "continuous constitutional convention," then how does our democracy differ from past oligarchies?

<p>	It is no small irony that this abrogation of federalism, our ultimate response to slavery, has brought on the second crushing evil to beset our nation: abortion. Only a judiciary that felt it had free rein to invoke "penumbras" within our Constitution could be so sick with power as to legalize mass extermination of our most innocent and defenseless citizens, our pre-born. Millions of pre-born children have been cruelly and brutally slaughtered -- a toll more horrific than any other holocaust -- because a simple majority of only nine men, ruling on behalf of 50 separate state constitutions, held that the Constitution, somewhere and somehow, contains a paramount right to privacy . . . and that "incorporation" dictates that this "penumbra" apply to the states.

<p>
	Every great social question in which the U.S. Supreme Court has weighed its opinion is the spawn of incorporation. Again, by what force of irony have our earnest attempts to rectify the problem of slavery ultimately given birth, not only to an even greater national sin in abortion but to a brood of contentious national issues that federalism was designed to pacify?

<p>	Consider, for instance, the charged issue of prayer in public schools. Any person with half a brain recognizes the insurmountable social problem of maintaining one collective way of publicly expressing our national adherence to the benevolent hand of God. And yet, precisely in response to public prayer -- contention that is completely natural and expected -- a simple majority of only nine unelected rulers told all of us that because one collective way of public prayer is not compatible with national cohesion, then no public prayer will be allowed. The doctrine of incorporation gives the Court this prerogative to rule in this manner.

<p>
	Every thinking American schooled in our national heritage -- all except a majority of the robed nine -- knows the intrinsic secular benefit from publicly acknowledging our Creator. Allowing and even encouraging public-school children to formally and vocally acknowledge their Creator impresses upon each of them a fundamental doctrine of Americanism -- that inalienable rights come from a Creator and not from man.

<p>
	Hence, these rights cannot be justifiably taken from them by men and their governments. How else can we more effectively impress this powerful message on the minds of rising generations? Incorporation states that we need not even try.

<b>by Joe Loconte</b>
</CENTER>
<P>
	States across the country are trying to reduce welfare costs and attack the system's culture of 
subsidized family breakdown. They're capping benefits for additional children born into welfare 
families, booting childless recipients from the rolls, and setting time limits on assistance. One of 
the nation's most provocative experiments aims to reform not only welfare but the individuals 
who receive it -- by turning over the state's role as social worker to local churches and 
synagogues.
<p>
	"God, not government, will be the savior of welfare recipients," says Mississippi governor 
Kirk Fordice. The Republican governor is convinced that the religious community can succeed 
where government by itself cannot -- by transforming the attitudes and behaviors of the welfare 
class. What is emerging in Mississippi is an unprecedented alliance between the governor, the 
state's Department of Human Services (DHS), and scores of local churches_all determined to 
tap the moral and spiritual resources of congregations to help lift Mississippi's 167,000 welfare 
recipients into permanent economic independence.
<p>
	Mississippi appears ripe for such an experiment. It is at once one of the nation's poorest states 
and one of its most religious. There are more churches here per capita than in any other state, but 
it also has the largest percentage of citizens receiving welfare assistance. Here many children still 
begin their school days in prayer, but more and more of those same children are having babies, 
pushing the state's illegitimacy rate to 44 percent. Here the cab drivers listen to Christian radio 
but navigate in cities where more than half of all children now live with an unmarried mother.
<p>
	A Gallup poll reveals that Mississippi and its southern neighbors boast "the greatest 
concentration and highest levels of religious fervor in America." So why hasn't all of this 
religiosity translated into stronger families, fewer people dependent on government welfare, and 
fewer social problems?
<p>
	It is perhaps ironic that a politician, not a preacher, has moved that question near the center of 
welfare reform in Mississippi. A year ago, Fordice summoned the state's religious leaders to the 
capitol, where he more or less read them the riot act. He challenged them to reach out 
aggressively to needy families in their communities, but to stop repeating the errors of 
government assistance. "The present system does absolutely nothing to inspire self-esteem, 
independence, or healthy family relationships," he has said.
<p>
	The "Faith and Families Project" hopes to revolutionize that system by matching welfare 
families, typically headed by an unmarried mother with at least two children, with congregations 
ready to become their <i>de facto</i> social workers. DHS officials expect participating 
churches to help individuals find good jobs and keep them. That means getting personally 
involved in ways that most state caseworkers, each tracking more than 200 families, cannot: 
lending emotional support and helping with child care, household budgeting, even grocery 
shopping.
<p>
	So far, the state has struck an arrangement that is keeping church-state litigators quiet. 
Churches are not asked to provide any financial support to welfare recipients; families are not 
required to attend the churches providing help. No welfare benefits are funneled through 
congregations, but government assistance, averaging $858 a month per family, continues until 
the family is independent.
<p>
	State officials expect, however, that congregations will do what they dare not try: wield moral 
authority and spiritual values among the state's 50,000 AFDC families -- one by one -- to 
transform their culture of dependency. "The problem is not material poverty, it is behavioral 
poverty," says Donald Taylor, executive director of the Mississippi DHS. "We're not interested 
in getting churches to replace welfare. What we're asking them is, `what can you provide to help 
move a family from economic slavery to economic independence?' "
<p>
	The answers are becoming increasingly urgent as Congress converts the federal welfare 
system into block grants, shifting primary responsibility for the poor back to the state and local 
level. Mississippi's tough welfare-to-workfare program, buoyed by rapid job growth, has helped 
reduce AFDC rolls by 12,000 families over the last three years. But state and federal welfare 
costs, including Medicaid, food stamps and supplemental security income, hit $2.3 billion in 
Mississippi in 1993, or at least $16,870 per family in poverty. Moreover, no state has a higher 
portion of its welfare expenses -- about 80 percent -- paid by the federal government than 
Mississippi.
<p>
	By maintaining the state's safety net but focusing on permanent behavioral change, Fordice 
hopes to reduce generational poverty. The goal: to see each of the state's 5,000 congregations 
adopt a welfare family, or about 10 percent of the existing caseload. Fordice hopes to bring down 
the number of long-term dependents, keep newly independent families from slipping back into 
poverty, and help families at risk -- hopefully making large new state expenditures on welfare 
unnecessary.
<p>
	Will it work?
<p>
	Beatrice Branch, Mississippi director of the NAACP, expects "minimal" results, claiming the 
plan "does not have broad-based support." Rims Barber, an ACLU lobbyist in Jackson, calls the 
program an election-year ploy, "a strong PR campaign, but that's all." 
<p>
	Try telling that to the Rev. Ronald Moore, the pastor of Stronger Hope Church in north 
Jackson. Moved by the governor's vision to enlist the aid of local churches, Moore began to 
challenge his black, middle-class congregation to reach out to welfare families in the city's 
depressed central and south sections. His congregation of about 200 has adopted 17 families, and 
five have found full-time employment. "I think the governor has hit a grand slam," says Moore. 
"He has caused many church leaders to say `yes, we've dispensed love, but there is a group of 
people who we've not really changed.' "
<p>
	Much of the state's religious community -- dominated mainly by independent-minded Baptist 
churches and black congregations with memories of racial segregation -- remains skeptical about 
any partnership with government. Nevertheless, about 175 churches have contacted the DHS to 
get profiles of welfare families in their neighborhoods, and have adopted more than 75 families 
on AFDC. In September, the Mississippi Family Council hosted a conference on breaking the 
welfare cycle that drew more than 200 church leaders and lay people.
<p>
	 The most common refrain was that churches -- black and white -- are indeed failing in their 
most basic moral and spiritual responsibilities to the poor.
<p>
	"There is something wrong with a gospel that will not lead people out of poverty," says the 
Rev. Thomas Jenkins, chairman of the church-based New Lake Development Foundation in 
central Jackson. The foundation offers tutoring programs and classes for the General Equivalency 
Degree, carpentry, computer training, and transitional housing for women and children -- all 
emphasizing the implications of faith on daily decision-making.
<p>
	Moore, who recruits congregations statewide for the program, emphasizes the role of the 
church in teaching personal responsibility and hard work, sexual abstinence and fatherhood. His 
favorite theme: "Stop doing what the government's been doing. Government has been trying to 
treat the effect, the aftermath. But we've got to go back to the basics and treat the cause." 
<p>
	Over the last year, Moore has addressed more than 300 pastors representing several 
denominations. Numerous churches have endorsed the initiative, including the National Baptist 
Convention, the nation's largest black denomination.
<p>
	Top DHS officials, handpicked by Governor Fordice, are reading from the same reform 
hymnal. Executive director Taylor has invited a leading consulting firm to work with his deputies 
and divisional directors to remake the agency's philosophy of assistance. State caseworkers who 
continue to function as "enablers," Taylor says, are in for a rude awakening. 
<p>
	The buzzwords at the DHS now are "accountability," "responsibility," and "permanent 
change." That's a significant leap for any state welfare department. And if large numbers of the 
state's congregations take up the governor's challenge to labor among the poor, then Mississippi 
could redefine the welfare debate with other words -- such as faith, hope, and charity.

<h2>Graham Cracks the Racial Barrier</h2>
<p>
	Mississippi governors haven't always had such cordial relations with religious leaders. In 
1952, a fiery young Southern Baptist preacher named Billy Graham led an interracial crusade in 
Jackson, defying segregationist governor Hugh White's request that he hold entirely separate 
services for blacks.
<p>
	Graham wrestled with the segregation question just as he was beginning to attain national 
prominence as an evangelical preacher. Though he rejected separate services during his Jackson 
campaign, Graham accepted segregated seating. He seemed to have done so with reservations. 
Toward the close of the crusade, he said that God's love knows no racial barriers. Moreover, he 
identified Jackson's two greatest social problems as illegal liquor (Mississippi was still dry) and 
segregation.
<p>
	"There is no scriptural basis for segregation. It may be there are places where such is desirable 
to both races, but certainly not in the church," Graham told the crowd. "The ground at the foot of 
the cross is level. . . . [I]t touches my heart when I see whites stand shoulder to shoulder with 
blacks at the cross."
<p>
	Though Graham's statements were both risky and visionary -- he made them four years before 
Martin Luther King Jr. rose to national prominence -- he waffled on the segregation question 
when challenged by critics. He must have done some soul-searching over the next several 
months: In March 1953, a year before the Supreme Court outlawed segregated schools, Graham 
told the sponsoring committee of his Chattanooga, Tennessee, crusade that he could not abide 
segregated seating. The committee balked. Graham didn't blink: Committee members watched in 
astonishment as he personally took down the ropes separating black and white sections.
<p>
	After the Court's <i>Brown v. Board of Education</i> ruling, Graham never permitted any 
form of enforced segregation in his meetings, even in the Deep South.
<p.
	"The church should have been the pacesetter. The church should voluntarily be doing what the 
federal courts are doing by pressure and compulsion," the young preacher said. Graham soon 
became convinced -- as even many secularists now claim -- that "a great spiritual revival is 
needed to relieve the racial and political tensions of today."

<h2>Good Samaritan Awards</h2> The Acton Institute for the Study
of Religion and Liberty is a nonprofit educational institute that
explores the moral dimensions of a free society. Last year the
institute established its Good Samaritan Awards to honor and encourage
the moral and practical advantages of private charity. From nearly
700 applicants, Acton recently honored 10 leading models of effective
private charity, both secular and religiously based. Each winner
received a $1,000 grant; three finalists will soon be chosen by
a national panel of judges and awarded cash grants of $10,000
each. The 10 model programs for 1995 are:<p>

<B>The Value of Victorian Virtues</B>
<br><I>The
De-Moralization of Society: From Victorian Virtues to Modern Values</I> by
Gertrude Himmelfarb (Knopf)<br>
 Maybe it's not so bad being a Victorian
moralist after all. True, writes Himmelfarb, the Victorians could
be stuffy, self-absorbed moralists. But it is equally true that
they acted &quot;on behalf of the poor, whom they sought not only
to assist materially but also to elevate morally, spiritually,
culturally, intellectually.&quot; The distinction provides a crucial
lesson for contemporary welfare reformers. The Victorians are
moralists in the sense that they believed in virtues-qualities
of character and morality that were desirable for every citizen
in a civilized society. Late-20th-century America no longer believes
in virtues, Himmelfarb writes, but has substituted for them the
notion of values-preferences that are relative and subjective.
One result is a welfare system that delivers services to the poor
but dares not address their deeper moral or spiritual needs. &quot;We
have so completely rejected any kind of moral principle,&quot;
Himmelfarb writes, &quot;that we have deliberately, systematically
divorced poor relief from moral sanctions and incentives.&quot;
The discrepancy between Victorian virtues and modern values has
produced vastly different outcomes. As it entered the 19th century,
England was caught in the teeth of industrialism, capitalism,
secularism-features of modernity responsible for the social upheaval
America is now experiencing. But the Victorian ethos was grounded
in the Christian traditions of Evangelicalism and Methodism, along
with their secular counterpart, Utilitarianism. The result? &quot;At
the end of the 19th century,&quot; she writes, &quot;England was
a more civil, more pacific, more humane society than it had been
at the beginning.&quot; Two social indicators: Between 1845 and
1900, illegitimate births in England fell from 7 percent of all
births in 1845 to less than 4 percent by 1900, while the rate
of serious crime declined by almost 50 percent.<P>
<B>The Economics
of Trust</B><br><I>Trust: The Social Virtues &amp; The Creation of Prosperity</I> by Francis Fukuyama (The Free Press)<br>
 Fukuyama argues
that America's greatness comes from a spirit of individual liberty
balanced by &quot;a rich network of voluntary associations and
community structures to which individuals have subordinated their
narrow interests.&quot; America in the past was as group-oriented
as Japan and Germany, Fukuyama writes, and this trait accounts
for the dominance of these countries in the international marketplace.
Only societies with a high degree of social trust can create the
flexible, large-scale business organizations needed for successful
competition in the global economy. The crucial difference between
America and the two other nations is that social cooperation here
was not enforced through emperors or kaisers. In America, strong
community emerged in the absence of a strong state. America's
economic future is now endangered by the rapid depletion of its
social capital. Fukuyama argues that the dominance of rights-based
liberalism, the rise of violent crime and civil litigation, the
collapse of the family, the decline of neighborhoods, churches,
unions, and charities, and the breakdown of shared values are
destroying Americans' ability to cooperate with each other. It
is no accident, he suggests, that those ethnic groups with the
highest degree of internal trust are economically the most successful.
He cites the importance of Asian-American rotating credit associations
that count on family members and business associates to honor
their debts. The author explores &quot;the paradox of family values&quot;:
While families in America are &quot;too weak to perform their
basic task of socialization,&quot; in some societies families
&quot;are too strong to permit the formation of modern economic
organizations.&quot; In Chinese, Italian, and French societies,
Fukuyama suggests, family members trust each other completely.
But intense distrust of outsiders precludes civic or political
life outside the family, and nearly all economic organizations
are family-based. Most giant corporations are government-run,
because unrelated people don't trust each other enough to work
together.<P>

<I>Building a Community of Citizens:
Civil Society in the 21st Century</I> Don E. Eberly, ed. (University
Press of America)<br>
 The 23 essays that make up <I>Building a Community
of Citizens: Civil Society in the 21st Century</I> explore the
condition of America's civic life and endeavor to identify the
ideas and policies required for social renewal as America moves
into the next century. The work seeks to define the unique American
&quot;creed&quot; that will inform this renewal: &quot;If Americans
are to build a community of citizens,&quot; Don Eberly argues,
&quot;they will have to do so within, not outside of, the American
philosophical tradition.&quot; Many of the contributors see that
tradition in the ideas of the American founding, including justice
and limited government as well as equal opportunity and responsible
freedom. These ideas remain, as Heather Higgins puts it, the &quot;cultural
building blocks&quot; of America's future. Edward Schwartz (among
others) would include Tocqueville's concept of civil society and
mediating institutions. In the political sphere, &quot;governmentalism&quot;
must be replaced by active citizenship and revitalized political
institutions. The political party, according to Colleen Sheehan,
was supposed to be &quot;the most encompassing and decisive expression
of our common republican opinion and civic character.&quot;  In
the cultural sphere, relativism must be replaced by strong families,
personal morality, and religious faith. Unless America &quot;respects
and protects&quot; the relationship between religion and public
life, writes Os Guinness, &quot;both American religious liberty
and public discourse will he handicapped.&quot;

<B>Small is Beautiful</B>
<br><I>Loving
Your Neighbor: A Principled Guide to Personal Charity</I> Marvin
Olasky, ed. (Capital Research Center)<br>
 Culled from <I>Philanthropy,
Culture and Society</I>, the 12 practical essays in this book
illustrate the virtues and pitfalls of personal charity. The book's
premise is that government welfare and the &quot;upstairs&quot;
philanthropy of wealthy foundations fail because they aim to meet
only the physical needs of the poor. Through factual reporting,
the writers show small-scale, &quot;downstairs&quot; charities
that do more good by urging the needy to change their conduct
and attitudes. As the title implies, the book also emphasizes
the centrality of religion in transforming lives. But even small,
religious charities can forget some of the &quot;basics of successful
philanthropy: think small, and think of souls rather than bodies.&quot;
Some charities err in relying on one charismatic leader; others
imperil their religious character by accepting government or foundation
funding with strings attached. The writers draw key lessons from
successful programs as well as from those that have gone awry.
Gerry Wisz investigates one New York soup kitchen's evolution
from merely offering meals to the homeless to encouraging personal
responsibility. Frederica Mathewes-Green shows how volunteer-run
pregnancy care centers in Maryland enable low-income women to
bring their babies to term by offering them shelter, clothing,
and comfort. Marvin Olasky examines a Texas charity that sacrificed
its success by purging its spiritual qualities to secure government
funding. Dan McMurry recounts how competition for grants among
charities in Murfreesboro, Tennessee, led them to create a pauper
class to justify their existence. Olasky concludes that &quot;poverty-fighters
should commit themselves to helping only those . . . who are willing
to work hard and change their life-styles.&quot; <I>Capital Research Center -- tel: 202-393-2600, fax: 202-393-2626.</I>

<B>A Second Look at Habitat</B><br>&quot;It's
Time to Take Habitat for Humanity Seriously&quot; by Howard Husock<br>
<I>City Journal</I>, Summer 1995. Conservatives treat Habitat for
Humanity lightly, writes Husock, because of its affiliation with
former president Jimmy Carter. But Habitat is fast becoming the
biggest homebuilder in America and offers a program that draws
on conservative ideals. The organization builds modest new houses
in the belief that low-income families will maintain orderly neighborhoods
if they own their own homes. To qualify, a low-income applicant
must meet rigorous standards of responsibility. A prospective
owner must participate in the construction of his home. Habitat
then offers the owner an interest-free mortgage. The owner must
also help build someone else's home, and his house is repossessed
if he defaults on the payments. The result, in many cases: Safe,
clean neighborhoods and low-income homeowners with pride and a
stake in an orderly and prosperous community. All of the money
used in Habitat's construction projects comes from private sources. <I>Manhattan

<B>Foundation Fossils</B><br>&quot; Philanthropical Correctness&quot; by
David Samuels <I>The New Republic</I>, Sept. 18 &amp; 25, 1995<br>
Although their assets have tripled in the last 25 years, Samuels
contends that America's philanthropic foundations have become
irrelevant to public policy. The foundations that once funded
the discovery of the polio vaccine and the expansion of our public
library system cannot boast such lofty achievements today. Samuels
cites four reasons. First, rather than fund programs that offer
practical solutions to failures in education, welfare, and crimefighting,
these foundations fund multicultural programs designed to promote
&quot;diversity&quot; and &quot;tolerance.&quot; Second, these
foundations give more money to liberal advocacy groups like the
Children's Defense Fund than they give to university research.
Third, foundations no longer subject grantees to independent scholarly
review but rely on foundation bureaucrats with little policy expertise.
Finally, these foundations suffer from inbreeding and parochialism.
Nearly 40 percent of foundation CEOs are hired from within the
nonprofit sector, 30 percent from within their own foundations.
The result: chronic myopia. Obsessed with multicultural concerns
and hamstrung by stale thinking, our leading foundations pay little
attention to our society's most pressing issues.<I>The New Republic -- tel:

<B>Wilsonian Liberals</B><br>&quot;Liberalism's
Lost Tradition&quot; by Fred Siegel &amp; Will Marshall <I>The New Democrat</I>, Sept./Oct. 1995 <br>
Writing in the Democratic Leadership
Council's house magazine, Fred Siegel and Will Marshall assure
Democrats fearful of obsolescence that one tradition within liberalism
might accord with America's repudiation of New Deal statism. Woodrow
Wilson's &quot;New Freedom&quot; liberalism took aim at the concentration
of power in turn-of-the-century corporate America by curbing trusts.
Siegel and Marshall suggest that today's Democrats should direct
this ideological animus toward our centralized federal government.
During the 1912 presidential contest between Wilson and Theodore
Roosevelt, they note, Roosevelt was supported by both corporate
moguls and social workers. These odd bedfellows were united in
a &quot;common condescension&quot; for the common man. Wilson
criticized paternalism, argued against social planning by either
corporate monopolies or by a large, interventionist federal government,
and championed individual and economic liberty. Siegel and Marshall
urge today's Democrats to tap into this lost &quot;anti-statist
but radically democratic&quot; tradition by breaking the federal
government's monopoly over public decisionmaking and resources. <I>Democratic Leadership Council -- tel: 202-546-0007, fax: 202-544-5002.  <P>

<B>Drafted
Volunteers</B><br>&quot;Charity Begins at School&quot; by Chester E.
Finn Jr. &amp; Gregg  Vanourek <I>Commentary</I>, Oct. 1995 <br>
Government
by the people or people by the government? Hudson Institute Scholars
Finn and Vanourek assess mandatory community service in our schools.
Finn and Vanourek oppose &quot;compulsory-service learning&quot;
because it confuses political action with community service and
hence promotes projects with an ideological cast. In Cecil County,
Maryland, students earned credit for lobbying the county government
to maintain its recycling program. Furthermore, mandated volunteer
service is itself an oxymoron that obscures the virtue of true
voluntarism. And who's to say which student projects meet service
requirements? In Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, a high-school student
was denied her diploma because the time she spent volunteering
in a nursing home and for Meals on Wheels was not school-directed
service. Finally, the authors claim that mandatory service threatens
church-based and private-sector volunteer work. In the near-term,
mandatory service monopolizes the time children might otherwise
devote to private-sector charity, and it discourages private-sector
voluntarism in the long-run by teaching children that voluntarism
is no more fulfilling than writing lab reports and meeting paper
deadlines. <I>Commentary -- tel: 212-751-4400, fax: 212-751-1174.</I>

<B>Vo-Tech
Strikes Out</B><br>
&quot;The President's Apprentices&quot; by Jonathan
Marshall  <I>Reason</I>, March 1995 <br>
Faced with declining wages
for high-school graduates, the Clinton administration has embraced
school-to-work programs. But Marshall argues that students put
through the paces of vocational training are no better off in
the long-term than students who go the strictly academic route.
A recent National Assessment of Vocational Education study reports
that graduates of vocational education in California are employed
at the same rates and earn about as much as general track graduates.
In fact, according to a Labor Department report released last
year, many male graduates of vocational education actually earn
less than those who have graduated from traditional high school
programs. The central difficulty seems to be that graduates of
vocational education often do not obtain jobs that match their
training. In Germany, where most trained bakers work for Ford
Motor Company, only half of German apprenticeship graduates work
in the fields in which they were trained. Consequently, some studies
show that students might do better to delay career choices until
they gain more work experience and until they can better direct
their career training. The bottom line: Inefficient, vocational
education provides no quick fix to the falling wages of low-income
Americans. <I>Reason Foundation -- tel: 310-391-2245, fax: 310-391-4395.</I>
<P><B>Land
of Opportunity</B><br>
&quot;Why Koreans Succeed&quot; by Heather Mac Donald <I>City Journal</I>, Spring 1995 <br>
Mac Donald assures us that
the American dream is alive and epitomized by Korean-American
grocers in New York. Their success, she argues, is fueled by the
same factors that have enabled other immigrant groups to succeed:
hard work, an emphasis on education, and strong community ties.
Some of these factors manifest themselves in distinctly Korean
ways. Korean communities form gaes, or communal savings pools,
to provide interest-free loans to budding businessmen. And many
Korean children boost their academic achievement by attending
a hagwon or &quot;prep school&quot; after school and on weekends.
But Mac Donald warns that America has grown economically and culturally
hostile towards Korean entrepreneurship. New York City requires
grocers to pay 14 different taxes and obtain numerous licenses;
Koreans also endure race-based boycotts and racial crimes. Consequently,
Korean immigration has slowed to a trickle and some are returning
home. Urban America will suffer if Korean entrepreneurship is
stifled. By introducing stable and successful businesses to low-income
neighborhoods in New York and Los Angeles, Koreans have spearheaded
urban renewal. Many Koreans are still committed to building successful
businesses here. Will we let them? <I>Manhattan Institute -- tel:

<p><B>Hired Off the Streets</B><br>&quot;From
Underclass to Working Class&quot; by James L. Payne  <I>The American
Enterprise</I>, Sept./Oct. 1995 <br>
The Dallas branch of the Industrial
Labor Service Corp. (ILS) proves that the invisible hand can be
a helping hand. ILS, Payne reports, is the largest employer of
temporary laborers in Dallas. It hires from among Dallas's down-and-out.
ILS pays these workers $4.70 an hour but charges companies $7.50
an hour for their services. ILS uses the difference to provide
its workers with lodging, breakfast and lunch, transportation,
and tools, and it makes a profit of 17 cents an hour per worker.
Unlike most private charities touted by conservatives, ILS is
primarily profit-driven. It does not demand its &quot;clients&quot;
change personal habits and attitudes as many faith-based charities
do. But, Payne reports, laborers find ILS benevolent (it provides
lunch out of generosity, not a desire to raise productivity).
And they also learn the lesson of exchange-you have to give something
to receive something-that many charities try to instill by demanding
behavioral or spiritual change in exchange for material aid. Payne
warns that &quot;working halls&quot; like ILS are threatened by
the news media and the government, which accuse them of exploitation. <I>American

<B>Black Christian Schools</B><br>
&quot;The
New Exodus&quot; by Joe Maxwell <I>World</I>, April 15, 1995<br>
In 1954,
Brown v. Board of Education paved the way for the integration
of public schools. Many black families abandoned Christian schools
in favor of integrated public education. Forty years later, Maxwell
reports, blacks are returning. Nearly 10 percent of African-American
children from kindergarten to fifth grade attend private schools,
up from 3.8 percent in 1968. Maxwell argues that black parents
appreciate the discipline and the unambiguous moral education
their children receive at these schools. They are happy that their
children are required to wear uniforms, that the school environment
they send their children to is drug-, gang-, and violence-free,
and that prayer is an essential component of their children's
school day. The revival of black Christian academies is hardly
the result of separatist sentiment. Their main agenda is providing
excellent Christian education. The rise of such schools is an
indictment of poor public education. In the words of one supporter,
&quot;How many more generations of black children's education
are we going to allow to be destroyed . . . by an incompetent,
costly, self-serving government education establishment?&quot; <I>World -- tel:

<B>Mormon Charity</B><br>
&quot; Work, Not Welfare
in the Mormon Church&quot; by Ralph Hardy <I>The American Enterprise</I>,
Sept./Oct. 1995 
<br>Sixty years ago, at the dawn of the welfare state
and its &quot;culture of dependence,&quot; the Mormon Church built
its own welfare program on the principle of individual responsibility.
At the center of this system lies the &quot;bishops' storehouse.&quot;
Akin to a discount retailer like Price Club, it warehouses foodstuffs
and other essentials. At times throughout the year, Mormons volunteer
their labor on farms that supply the storehouse. Mormons also
fast on the first Sunday of every month, and the money that would
have been spent on skipped meals is used to purchase items for
the storehouse. When a Mormon bishop determines that a truly needy
individual or family has no other means of support, such as relatives
in another state, he may offer food and supplies from the church's
storehouse. In exchange, recipients are usually required to perform
some service for the church community and to search for employment,
with the church's help. Hardy argues that his church's system
is one antidote to the maladies of our current welfare system.<I>American

<B>Future Businessmen</B><br>
&quot;New
Kids on the Block: The National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship&quot; by
Martin Morse Wooster <I>Philosophy, Culture and Society</I>, June
1995 <br>
After being mugged on a Bronx street in 1981, businessman
Steve Mariotti wondered why bright inner-city kids would risk
their futures for the paltry $10 they stole from him. Mariotti
wanted to help at-risk children learn how to calculate risk and
reward for legitimate ends. Because schools often do not give
students the practical skills and work habits that lead to success
in business, Mariotti established the National Foundation for
Teaching Entrepreneurship (NFTE) in 1986. Today, NFTE operates
in nine urban centers, including New York City, Boston, and Philadelphia.
Its budget has grown from $600,000 in 1991 to $5.5 million today,
thanks to charitable contributions from foundations and other
sources. And what does this money buy? Student entrepreneurs are
given business cards, a $10 bank account, $50 for start-up costs,
and the opportunity to read the Wall Street Journal once a week.
With this start, students build their own small businesses and
learn about profit, loss, finance, marketing, negotiation, and
customer service. Greg Blair sells trading cards. Regina Jackson
markets the jewelry she makes. Low-income minority students are
the target of this program. In Washington, D.C., nearly all of
the approximately 250 students who participate in NFTE are low-income
African Americans. Consequently, the textbooks used in NFTE classes,
one of which is co-authored by Mariotti, profile the entrepreneurial
successes of formerly disadvantaged minorities. Wooster's reporting
is choc-full of heart-warming anecdotes garnered from his visits
to NFTE programs in D.C. schools. He concludes that NFTE fills
a valuable niche: It is the one program that actually shows inner-city
youth a path to success different from one littered with violence
and despair. <I>Capital Research Center -- tel: 202-393-2600, fax:

<B>Welfare as We Will Know It</B><BR>&quot;Ending the Welfare State, Pts. I and II&quot; <I>Alternatives in Philanthropy</I>,
April &amp; May 1995 <BR>
In this two-part series, 14 leading conservatives
propose alternatives to the welfare state. David Forte wants to
bolster private charities by offering taxpayers a 110 percent
tax deduction for charitable contributions. William Tucker thinks
that for every hour a person spends doing volunteer work, he or
she should be rewarded with a tax credit equal to his or her regular
earned income per hour. Charles D. Hobbs suggests making working
more profitable than welfare by subsidizing private-sector employment
for welfare recipients. George Liebmann argues that we should
model day care in the U.S. after the British, who rely heavily
on parent-organized and volunteer-run cooperative playgroups.
Michael Tanner urges that adoption be eased by lifting restrictions
on transracial adoption, terminating the custodial rights of biological
parents whose children have been in foster care for a year, and
by ending funding formulas that encourage states to keep as many
children as possible in the foster care system.  Michael Novak
argues that teen moms should be blocked from setting up independent
households, while Elizabeth Fox-Genovese advocates placing them
and their children in maternity homes. The proposals assume that,
absent welfare, the private-sector holds the answers to our social
problems. <I>Capital Research Center -- tel: 202-393-2600, fax: 202-393-2626.</I>

<p><B>Carrying
the Torch</B><br>
The Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games recently
sponsored a nationwide search for &quot;community heroes&quot;
to carry the torch in this summer's Torch Relay. About 5,500 honorees
will carry the torch. A hero, as defined by the sponsors, is &quot;a
person who through his/her selfless acts or achievements has positively
influenced their community, functioning as a role model for others.&quot;
Winners will be announced in February.<P>

The U.S. Catholic Conference now offers a toll-free movie-review service
that rates films by moral content and artistic merit. Brief reviews
accompany ratings, which range from &quot;A-1&quot; (general audiences)
to &quot;O&quot; (morally objectionable). It lauds Martin Scorsese
for his direction in Casino but rates the movie &quot;O&quot;
for its &quot;graphic violence, fleeting nudity, substance abuse,
and incessant rough language.&quot; <I>U.S. Catholic Conference - tel:

<p>
Movieguide Hotline promises reviews &quot;from
a Biblical perspective.&quot; Operated by the nondenominational
Christian nonprofit Good News Communications, it rates movies
for quality and moral acceptability. While Seven receives three
of four possible stars for artistic merit, it is deemed morally
unacceptable for its &quot;virulent religious bigotry.&quot; Movieguide
does differ from its Catholic counterpart; you are charged $1.49

<B>Pope John Paul II on Democracy</B><P>
Democracy cannot be sustained
without a shared commitment to certain moral truths about the
human person and human community. The basic question before a
democratic society is: &quot;How ought we live together?&quot;
In seeking an answer to this question, can society exclude moral
truth and moral reasoning? Can the Biblical wisdom that played
such a formative part in the very founding of your country be
excluded from the debate? Would not doing so mean that America's
founding documents no longer have any defining content, but are
only the formal dressing of changing opinion? Would not doing
so mean that tens of millions of Americans could no longer offer
the contribution of their deepest convictions to the formation
of public policy?   Every generation of Americans needs to know
that freedom consists not in doing what we like, but in having
the right to do what we ought.        -- Baltimore, Md., Oct. 8,
1995

<B>Sen. Bill Bradley on Civil Society</B><br>
What both Democrats
and Republicans fail to see is that the government and the market
are not enough to make a civilization. There must also be a healthy,
robust civic sector-a space in which the bonds of community can
flourish. Government and the market are similar to two legs on
a three-legged stool. Without the third leg of civil society,
the stool is not stable and cannot provide support for a vital
America. . . .  We also have to give the distinctive moral language
of civil society a more permanent place in our public conversation.
The language of the marketplace says, &quot;Get as much as you
can for yourself.&quot; The language of government says, &quot;Legislate
for others what is good for them.&quot; But the language of community,
family and citizenship at its core is about receiving undeserved
gifts. What this nation needs to promote is the spirit of giving
something freely, without measuring it out precisely or demanding
something in return.        -- speech, National Press Club, Feb.
9, 1995

<h2>Japan's Parole Models</h2><br>
by <b>Leslie Gardner</b>
</center><p>
	To bring America's crime explosion under control, new prisons and longer sentences will not 
be enough. Most criminals are eventually released, and most return to a life of crime. In addition 
to tougher law enforcement, we need to find ways to turn former criminals into law-abiding 
citizens. Perhaps here, Americans can learn from the success of volunteer probation and parole 
officers in Japan.
<P>
	America's current system of probation and parole is a joke. On average, each of the nation's 
35,000 probation and parole officers must supervise 100 convicts. With so many charges, the 
typical officer is lucky if he can find his parolees or probationers, let alone monitor their 
movements. "Most state probation and parole systems have a serious problem with case 
overload," says Steve Varnum, the executive director of Justice Fellowship at Prison Fellowship 
Ministries. "This leads to a high percentage of parole and probation violations, with many 
offenders returning to prison." 
<p>
	Japan, by contrast, has fewer than 1,000 full-time professional probation and parole officers. 
These officers are recruited and trained as professionals in counseling, but with an average of 
100,000 new qualifying convicts each year, they are too few to counsel clients individually. 
Their real work is to assign cases to approximately 48,000 volunteer parole officers throughout 
the country.

<p>	Each volunteer on average supervises only two convicts, and his primary responsibility is 
to help them rejoin their families and neighborhoods as well as to monitor their movements. 
These volunteers-cum-social workers are clearly getting the job done: Fewer than 4 percent of 
Japanese criminals who have been assigned to a volunteer officer will commit another crime 
within a year of their release on parole or probation.
<P>
	What is the Japanese secret in dealing so effectively with criminal offenders? Part of the 
answer is the selection process for parole and probation. To qualify for probation or parole in 
Japan, an offender must show remorse  for his crime and meet certain criteria that prevent the 
release of serious or habitual criminals.
<p>
	In Japan, acceptance by one's family is often the most important factor in an offender's 
rehabilitation, for the concept of shame is still alive and well in this society. A volunteer officer 
visits the offender's home to help his family overcome the shame of having a relative convicted 
of a crime. If family reunification is deemed impossible, the volunteer finds the offender a place 
at a halfway house or with friends.

<p>
	The next step is to help the offender find stable employment, so he may again become a 
functional member of his community. This is also considered essential to rehabilitation, as the 
importance of societal acceptance is second only to that of acceptance by one's family. After a 
residence and a job have been secured, the volunteer officer continues to meet with his charge 
once or twice a month to provide counsel and to monitor his progress.
<p>
	An appointment as a volunteer probation or parole officer requires no special  training or 
background; candidates must simply be respected and financially stable. Volunteers come from a 
range of occupations, but more than half are fishermen or farmers, religious leaders, housewives, 
and retired people. Ninety percent of the volunteers are at least 50 years old and 80 percent are 
men.
<p>
	Once appointed by the Ministry of Justice, a volunteer's term of service is two years, but most 
are reappointed several times. Almost half serve at least 10 years.
<p>
	Japan formally authorized its system of suspended prosecution in 1924, and codified the 
network of volunteers upon which it depended in 1950. Research conducted by Japan's Ministry 
of Justice shows that the success of volunteer probation officers lies in the individual attention 
they are able to give each offender; they are often seen as friends or mentors rather than authority 
figures. Many convicts, moved by the fact that someone has taken an interest in their well-being, 
feel an obligation to work toward rehabilitation.
<p>
	Could such a system work in the United States? America would need more than 1.75 million 
volunteers to achieve the same 2:1 ratio as Japan. Still, small caseload ratios are key to the 
successful supervision of offenders. "Most criminal activity is preceded by a progression of 
inappropriate behaviors," Varnum says. "If an agent spends time with an offender and sees the 
environment the offender lives in, it will be much easier for the agent to recognize the 
inappropriate behaviors that may lead to the offender's participation in further criminal activity. 
The Japanese parole model serves that purpose of real time supervision."
<p>
	It's true that Japanese society, particularly the role of the family, is quite different. Sharing in 
the public control of behavior, of course, is not unique to Japan. Many U.S. cities have volunteer 
organizations whose members patrol their communities or teach conflict resolution and job skills. 
Churches and mosques have begun to welcome and find employment for former criminals. It's 
time to go further, and experiment with the Japanese volunteer model.

<title>What's New at Heritage - Policy Review - Jan/Feb 96 - Heritage</title>

<h2>Salvatori Prize</h2>

	Beginning in 1996, The Heritage Foundation will give an annual Salvatori Prize for American 
Citizenship.
<P>
	Endowed by a generous gift from the Henry Salvatori Foundation of Los Angeles, the 
Salvatori Prize for American Citizenship will recognize and reward extraordinary efforts by 
American citizens who help their communities solve problems the government has been unable 
or unwilling to solve. In the words of Heritage President <a 
href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner Jr.</a>, "The conservative revolution has two 
parts. Everyone understands that part one is to reduce the size and power of the federal 
government. Part two is to return responsibility to American citizens to solve local problems. We 
need to get government out of the way if this is to happen, but we also need to show people how 
to solve their own problems."
<p>
	The Salvatori Prize, Feulner said, is intended to do just that. "We will highlight the success 
stories, and encourage more successes, while promoting the kind of American citizenship 
envisioned by our Founding Fathers." The winner of the annual Salvatori Prize will receive a 
$25,000 cash award.
<p>
<h2>Reforms to Speed Adoption
</h2>

	This nation's $10-billion-per-year foster-care system keeps thousands of children from being 
united with loving parents," writes FitzGerald Senior Fellow <a 
href="/heritage/staff/fagan.htm">Patrick Fagan</a>, a former family therapist and clinical 
psychologist. "The anti-adoption bias of the current public-sector welfare bureaucracy has 
resulted in an adoption process with too many built-in obstacles. These obstacles feed children 
into the foster-care system and keep them there, ensuring a larger clientele for public agencies, at 
a staggering emotional cost," he says. "The quickest, simplest solution is for states, which have 
primary responsibility for regulating adoption, to place the job of finding suitable parents in the 
hands of private adoption services."
<p>
	Only 1 percent of women choose adoption as a solution to their unwanted pregnancies. "Some 
40 percent of pregnancy counselors don't even raise the issue of adoption with pregnant clients; 
another 40 percent provide incomplete or inaccurate information about adoption," Fagan says. 
Yet when adoption is mentioned, 38 percent choose it over alternatives like abortion.
Race is another barrier in the adoption system, Fagan says. A higher proportion of black than 
white children are available to adopt, and many white parents would like to adopt black children. 
Yet the welfare bureaucracy is dedicated to a policy of "race matching," which delays adoption 
for years. As a result, says Fagan, "black children typically wait two to three years longer than 
white children for adoptive homes." 
<p>
	To fix these and other problems, Fagan suggests a number of reforms. Besides privatizing all 
adoption services, he urges states to:
<p><ul>
<li> Remove obstacles to transracial adoptions.
<p>
<li> Enact a strict, 12-month timeline for working out the long-term parental status of any child 
in foster care.
<p>
<li> Separate the responsibility for protecting children from convicted abusive parents from that 
of preserving parental rights for families that can be helped. "Professionals should not be trapped 
between simultaneous demands to reunite every family and to protect every child," Fagan says. 
"When these duties are separated, both goals are better served." 
<p>
<li> Prohibit the removal of a child from foster parents willing to adopt, except when the child is 
being returned to its legal parents.
</ul>
<P>
	Fagan says Congress should:
<p><ul> 	
<li> Enact a means-tested, fully refundable, inflation-adjusted tax credit of up to $5,000 to help 
pay the substantial one-time costs incurred by adopting parents. 
<p>
<li> Require hospitals and clinics receiving federal aid to provide timely and accurate adoption 
information to all mothers who give birth out of wedlock.
<p>
<li> Prohibit the use of race or ethnicity to deny or delay placement of a child in foster care or 
adoption.
</ul><P>
<h2>"Trillion-Dollar Tax Hike"
</h2>

	The tax burden will rise by more than a trillion dollars over the next five years without 
Medicare reform, write Heritage analysts Robert Moffit, John Liu, and David Winston.
<p>
	"The Congressional Budget Office already projects that during the next five years, Medicare 
Part B, which covers doctors' fees and other services, will need an estimated $370.5 billion in 
general taxes," they write in a <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/fyi62.html">recent report</a>. 
<p>
	On top of that, if Congress resorts to an increase in the payroll tax to save Medicare Part A, 
the hospitalization program trust fund, this will require an estimated 3.5 percent hike on top of 
the current level of 2.9 percent, or $711 billion in new revenue over the next five years. "Right 
now, when you look at the combined level of taxation needed to save Medicare, the amount is 
almost triple President Clinton's 1993 tax hike, which ranks as the largest in U.S. history."
<p>
<h2>Heritage on the Web
</h2>

After just six months on the Internet, The Heritage Foundation's site on the World Wide Web, <a 
href="/heritage">http://www.heritage.org</a>, has registered more than 200,000 hits. The 
Heritage site is updated daily and features an extensive <a 
href="/heritage/library/welcome.html">library</a> of policy papers, <a 
href="/heritage/dept_writeups/95lect.html">lectures</a>, press releases, and current and back 
issues of <a href="/heritage/p_review">Policy Review</a>. Heritage's public policy research 
will soon be available on the Microsoft Network's Policy Street.
<p>
	The Heritage Foundation is one of 14 organizations on Town Hall, <a

<h2>Clara's Heart</h2>
<b>by Laura Morrow</b></center>
<p>
	Clara Barton struggled with bureaucratic insensitivity all her life. Her biggest problem was 
getting official permission to do good.
<p>
	Born Christmas Day, 1821, Barton showed a talent for organizing charity when she 
established the first free public school in Bordentown, New Jersey. After enrollments soared, the 
local school board pushed her aside.
<p>
	When the Civil War erupted, she felt driven to help. After learning that soldiers from her 
home state of Massachusetts were quartered in the U.S. Senate chambers without beds or 
supplies, she brought items from her home and, with her own money, purchased and prepared 
food for them.
<p>
	Barton discovered that ambulances, medical supplies, and hospital construction were not high 
priorities for the Union military bureaucracy. Henry Halleck, the Army's general-in-chief, 
dismissed them as "effeminating comforts." (He felt the same about shoes and shirts.) Union 
soldiers commonly died on the battlefield waiting for treatment, yet the Medical Department, 
valuing bureaucratic ritual over need, refused to change policy. Frustrated, Barton collected 
supplies and personally arranged their distribution.
<p>
	Barton eventually accumulated three warehousefuls of supplies and persuaded the Army to 
help distribute them at the front. At great personal risk -- a bullet ripped through her sleeve at 
Antietam and killed the injured soldier she was aiding -- Barton fed troops and helped evacuate 
the wounded. Nearly two years into the war, the Army finally agreed to contribute supplies to her 
volunteer efforts. She devised a plan for each state to establish a distribution agency where it had 
a substantial regimental presence.
<p>
	Barton encountered bureaucratic resistance everywhere. When the War Department ignored a 
sergeant's requests for a furlough -- despite the fact that both of his arms had been blown off in 
battle -- an outraged Barton escorted him to the office of Massachusetts senator Henry Wilson. 
She then explained that his furlough request was being disregarded and handed the senator the 
necessary paperwork. When Wilson extended his welcome, Barton commented, "You will 
pardon the sergeant for not offering you a hand -- he has none." The soldier left on furlough the 
following day. 
<p>
Exhausted by such struggles, Barton sought rest in Europe. In 1870, the Grand Duchess of Baden 
enlisted her help with the International Red Cross's relief effort for civilian refugees and 
wounded soldiers in the Franco-Prussian War. Admiring the systematic organization and 
efficiency of the institution, Barton undertook a one-woman effort to found an American chapter 
of the Red Cross. She sought congressional approval for the organization's involvement in 
wartime humanitarian aid, but was initially thwarted by fears of foreign entanglements.
<p>
	To make the organization more attractive to an isolationist Congress, Barton expanded its 
proposed focus to include domestic peacetime disaster relief, an expansion later adopted by the 
International Red Cross under the "American Amendment." Finally, in 1881, Barton founded the 
American Association of the Red Cross in Washington, D.C. She was elected its first president.
<p>
	Barton kept the American Red Cross decentralized, giving hands-on authority to local 
chapters. Journalist Joel Chandler Harris (of Uncle Remus fame) praised the charity's efficiency: 
"There are no exhibitions of self-importance. . . . The perfection of its machinery is shown by the 
apparent absence of machinery." 
<p>
	Nevertheless, in 1904, at 81, Barton was maneuvered out of the presidency by socialite Mabel 
Thorp Boardman, who wanted to transform the Red Cross into a more centralized administrative 
structure based on new theories of "scientific management." After leading a failed coup against 
Barton, she vengefully instigated a congressional investigation into the organization. Once the 
investigation vindicated her, Barton resigned.
<p>
	For her life's work, Barton received the German Iron Cross, the Red Cross of Geneva, and the 
Empress Augusta medal, among other honors. "They do brighten up an old dress," she joked. 
She spent her last years caring for relatives, occasionally pinning her medals on her dress before 
going out to milk the cows. She died at 91, in Glen Echo, Maryland.
<p>
	Today, Barton's organization remains volunteer-oriented and decentralized; its ratio of 
volunteers to paid workers is about 50:1. In addition to collecting 6 million units of blood (nearly 
half the nation's entire clinical blood supply) each year, the Red Cross provides aid after natural 
disasters, processes emergency communications between military personnel and their families, 
and offers first aid and medical training.
<p>
	Barton learned early on that charities attract two kinds of people: those concerned with doing 
good and those concerned with looking good. The former want to help; the latter are primarily 
interested in social engineering and self-aggrandizement. Her persistence and character 
ultimately triumphed over bureaucratic interference, making the Red Cross an effective force for 
good -- and one worthy of the memory of Clara Barton.

	While most folks in Washington fled the summer heat and humidity for the August recess,  a little-known special interest stayed behind to plot strategy. And so far it's working like gangbusters.
<p>	The National Cotton Council of America lobbies on behalf of cotton producers, ginners, warehousemen, merchants, crushers, cooperatives and manufacturers. During the recess, "King Cotton" declared war on Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture. And last week, it paid off.
<p>	The Council's efforts were instrumental in defeating in committee Roberts' attempt to end 60 years of failed New Deal agriculture policies. His farm-reform bill, the "Freedom to Farm Act of 1995," would have ended a special deal cotton producers enjoy. By allowing them to receive federal crop-support payments as three separate entities -- as individuals, corporations and partnerships, for example -- a mile-wide loophole in the current farm program lets cotton producers pull down two-and-a-half times the national average per-capita income. 
<p>	Roberts' plan was simple: Get the U.S. Department of Agriculture out of the business of deciding what farmers grow on their farms, and instead let individual farmers decide what they want to plant based on what they think they can grow profitably for markets around the world. The bill also would have eliminated the various government-reserve programs that encourage farmers to idle potentially productive farm land.
<P>	Of course, since the Roberts bill would have cut off the money spigot for the Cotton Council, an army of lobbyists descended on the capitol. The Council insisted that nothing less than keeping the status quo was "acceptable." In a recent "Action Request," the Council urged its members to tell their congressmen that Roberts' bill "abandons U.S. agriculture, will depress land values and will discourage new investment."
<p>	In fact, the American Farm Bureau Federation estimates farmers would have actually gained more than $7 billion extra over seven years as a result of the Roberts bill than they would under the current farm program. This is because the Roberts plan would have provided generous transition payments to help farmers switch from the current system to a free market, and because of  increased sales as farmers were freed from federal limits on how much they can plant.
<p>	Of course, the battle isn't over -- the House Budget Committee may take up farm reform next. It's members should be interested in a report released earlier this year by the General Accounting Office (GAO), which characterized the cotton program as a costly, complex maze of domestic and international price supports that benefit a small group of wealthy cotton producers. Cost to the taxpayers: more than $12 billion since 1986.
<p>	A privileged 300 cotton producers received between $250,000 and $1 million apiece in taxpayer dollars in 1993, and about 2,000 got between $100,000 and $250,000, thanks to the cotton loophole, according to GAO. The rest of the cotton industry's 95,000 participants have little to show from this sweetheart deal with Washington.
<p>	In fact, if the majority of America's cotton farmers knew the truth, they would be outraged. It so happens that of the 35 board members who attended the Council's June meeting in Charlotte, N.C. --  the group pushing hardest for the status quo -- only five actually were cotton farmers. The rest were ginners, warehousemen, merchants, crushers, heads of cooperatives, and manufacturers. In other words, 86 percent of the Cotton Council's top leaders don't even grow cotton. The processors and marketers who fill the majority of the board's seats want to keep nearly $1 billion in payments the Roberts bill would give to actual cotton growers to help them transition to a free market.<p>
	A simple question needs to be asked: Why does the government even have a price-support program for cotton at all? The argument typically put forward for having agricultural price-support programs is so that America will have "a stable food supply." But cotton isn't food. Besides, worldwide demand for cotton is at record levels. Cotton prices are higher than they have been at any time since the Civil War. 
<p>	Like so many government programs, the cotton subsidy, originally intended to help small farmers, has turned into another special-interest boondoggle. Pat Roberts took a courageous stand against corporate special interests who have wrapped themselves over the years in federal largesse, and lost. 
<p>	Now the House Republican leadership should give the Budget Committee a shot at deciding whether American farmers will be set free to compete in world markets, or stay chained to the special interests.

<P>
INTRODUCTION
<P>
     Congress is expected soon to consider legislation to implement
the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(GATT), the multilateral trade talks concluded successfully last
December. Among other provisions, the new pact for the first time
subjects trade in farm products to GATT's international trading rules.
(For a full discussion of the provisions of the Agriculture Agreement,
see Joe Cobb, "A Guide to the New GATT Agreement," Heritage Foundation
Backgrounder No. 985, May 5, 1994.) 
<P>
     This means that U.S. farmers will face substantially lower trade
barriers when trying to export their products. Under the agreement,
the signatories agreed that all existing non-tariff barriers
(including import quotas) must be converted to tariffs, and every
agricultural product must be allowed at least some minimum level of
access to their domestic markets under low or minimal tariff rates.
Countries that export farm products will be required to reduce the
volume of subsidized exports by 21 percent and the amount of the
subsidy by 36 percent over six years. The agreement also calls for
reduction of all domestic agricultural subsidies (such as U.S. farm
subsidies) tied to production of commodities and significant reduction
of all existing direct agricultural export subsidies. (Specific
changes in U.S. law required by the GATT agreement will have to be
made in the implementing legislation. Section 22 of the Agricultural
Adjustment Act, which provides authority to impose quotas if imports
are undercutting price support programs, will be repealed and replaced
with authority for tariff rate quotas. The implementing legislation
similarly curtails restrictions on imported peanuts, in addition to
limiting subsidized exports of government-held dairy stocks and
repealing the Meat Import Act.)
<P>
     Along with the new regional market opened up by the North
American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the prospect of expanding
free trade arrangements involving the United States, (See Michael G.
Wilson, "Building on the NAFTA: Forging a Free Trade Agreement with
Chile," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 991, June 27, 1994.)
ratification of GATT will open up a potential marketplace of six
billion customers for U.S. farmers -- compared with the U.S. domestic
market of only 250 million people. 
<P>
     The ability of American farmers to seize the opportunity provided
by this vast new market, however, will depend upon changes in U.S.
farm policy. America possesses the most productive land resources and
advanced agricultural infrastructure in the world, yet U.S. farmers
have been unable to capitalize on these advantages. Even though world
consumption of food and agricultural products has increased
substantially since 1981, U.S. agricultural exports have decreased
overall, and exports of unprocessed agricultural commodities have
fallen (see chart on page 3).
<P>
     One obstacle that must be removed if U.S. farmers are to take
advantage of GATT is supply-control policies, specifically the annual
acreage reduction programs (ARPs) and the Conservation Reserve Program
(CRP). These programs have removed on average over 15 percent of U.S.
acreage from production annually and thus limited the opportunity of
farmers to export. To appreciate what this means, it is as though
government policies had shut down 15 percent of the U.S. computer
industry while the international market for computers is booming.
Meanwhile, agricultural producers in the rest of the world have
increased their production to fill the void created by reduced U.S.
production. These foreign producers have sold their products at a
lower price, thereby making the United States the "residual supplier,"
or the last seller to be chosen in most markets.
<P>
     Another obstacle that stands in the way of farmers taking
advantage of GATT is the Export Enhancement Program (EEP), which
subsidizes the dumping of U.S. agricultural products on the world
market. Although EEP was intended to make U.S. farm products more
competitive, the program is counterproductive. In fact, U.S. export
subsidies depress world prices while domestic prices remain high,
creating a price differential that has made the United States an
importer of some agricultural products. (This was demonstrated earlier
this year when U.S. supply control programs contributed to a short
supply of durum wheat -- a specialty crop used in making pasta
products -- leading to increased imports of Canadian wheat in order to
supply U.S. pastamakers.)
<P>
     The United States has an opportunity to reverse these policies
and restore the competitive position of American agriculture when
Congress considers the 1995 farm bill. Because farm policy is
reauthorized only every four or five years in the farm bill, next
year's bill will be the first opportunity to revise these policies to
take advantage of GATT.
<P>
     For U.S. farmers to benefit from the world market opened up by
GATT, Congress needs to incorporate the following changes in farm
legislation: (Additional changes needed in U.S. agricultural policy
will be addressed in future papers.)
<P>
Eliminate all acreage reduction or set-aside programs.
<P>
Modify the Conservation Reserve Program to include only highly
erodible acres.
<P>
Eliminate the Export Enhancement Program.
<P>
     The U.S. policy of unilaterally idling massive land resources
already has led to a significant loss in America's share of the
expanding world market. This has shrunk farmers' ability to earn
income from the marketplace, held back the development of agribusiness
infrastructure, and caused economic problems for many rural areas. By
eliminating acreage reduction programs and modifying the Conservation
Reserve Program, Congress could make sure that U.S. agriculture once
again becomes the leading force in the world export market by enabling
U.S. farmers to take advantage of the promised benefits of GATT's
trade liberalization and reform. And by eliminating the Export
Enhancement Program, the U.S. will no longer be employing a trade-
distorting practice that actually undermines the potential of certain
export markets.
<P>
     The enormous export potential of American agriculture has been
held back for years by federal policies that largely ignore the huge
world market. GATT makes that world market potentially even larger and
attractive to U.S. farmers. If the 1995 farm bill revamps policies so
that farmers can make full use of agriculture's productive capacity to
compete in the world's market, U.S. farm income will increase and the
rural economy will receive an enormous boost, creating jobs, producing
greater prosperity, and reinvigorating distressed communities. But if
the farm programs are not revised, rural America will stagnate while
other countries exploit the new markets opened up by GATT.
<P>
A HUGE OPPORTUNITY FOR U.S. AGRICULTURE
<P>
     Implementing GATT will mark the beginning of a new era for world
agriculture and agricultural trade. Before the diplomatic breakthrough
which made the GATT agricultural agreement possible, trade
protectionism in agriculture was practiced throughout the world,
especially by such developed countries as the United States and the
nations of the European Union.
<P>
     This protectionism has not helped domestic producers, even in
developed countries. Explicit import restrictions, including quotas
and tariffs, and non-tariff trade barriers, such as unwarranted food
safety and quality regulations, merely have hindered the ability of
developing countries to penetrate the developed countries' markets. At
the same time, the United States and the European Union have been
waging a mutually destructive and trade-distorting bidding war, using
export subsidies to finance underpriced sales into the developing
countries. The costs of such distortions to agricultural production
and trade have been rising steadily while U.S. market share has
declined, as demonstrated in the chart on the preceeding page. The
GATT Uruguay Round agreement is significant because it reverses this
trend and reopens competition for markets based on productivity, not
protectionist policies.
<P>
     GATT will open up marketing opportunities for U.S. livestock
products throughout the world, including Japan and Europe (where
import barriers have been particularly restrictive). More
significantly, GATT will raise the incomes and standards of living in
the developing world because global economic expansion (the GATT
agreement is expected to expand the world economy by $6 trillion by
the turn of the century) will stimulate growth throughout the world.
This will lead in turn to more demand for higher-protein sources of
food. This trend is likely to be most pronounced in the fastest-
growing countries of Asia, Latin America, and Africa, where half the
population is under 15 years of age and the nutritional requirements
are greater than in older populations. By the end of this century, 60
percent of the world's population will be living in Asia, where
incomes are rising dramatically. And before the year 2050, it is
expected that world population will double and that, due to rising
standards of living, world food needs will triple. (Dennis T. Avery,
"Saving the Planet with High-Yield Farming," paper presented at The
Heritage Foundation's Agricultural Policy Roundtable, May 23, 1994.)  
<P>
     For U.S. farmers, this translates into an extraordinary
opportunity to increase the export of many agricultural commodities,
especially corn, soybeans, wheat, cotton, rice, and livestock
products. There are also indirect opportunities due to a larger world
market. For instance, the new access into the fast-growing Asian
market for beef, pork, and poultry will mean increased domestic
consumption of grains by U.S. livestock. Thus, the U.S. grain sector
will benefit not only from direct sales of grain, but also from
greater sales of grain-fed livestock.
<P>
     Since U.S. agricultural productivity is rising faster than
domestic food demand, agriculture's well-being depends heavily on
international trade. If U.S. farmers manage to regain the competitive
edge internationally, the share of overall U.S. production going to
export will increase significantly; but if this historic opportunity
is lost because domestic farm policies hold back potential exports,
farming communities will suffer greatly.
<P>
     Existing U.S. agricultural policies already have hastened the
loss of much of the agricultural market in Western Europe. Rather than
concentrate their efforts on the daunting task of trying to regain
limited markets already lost, however, U.S. farmers stand to gain much
more from looking to the growing markets of the future. For instance,
farmers need to develop the Asian and Latin American markets and be
poised to move into Africa as that market awakens. U.S. agriculture is
now at a crossroads where it must use its advantageous position to
capture a greater share of these expanding markets stimulated by the
rising food needs of a growing population.
<P>
DOMESTIC BENEFITS OF GROWTH-ORIENTED PRODUCTION AND EXPORT POLICIES
<P>
     American farmers have much to gain if policies are amended to
take full advantage of GATT. First, however, U.S. policies will have
to be changed to raise output rather than curb it and to make prices
more competitive. U.S. farm programs today use non-recourse loans,
target prices, and deficiency payments to stabilize the income of
farmers producing certain commodities. "Non-recourse" means a farmer
can borrow money from the government on his harvested crop and then
either repay the loan and sell the crop or default on the loan and
forfeit the crop to the government. The farmer's credit rating is not
affected by his default, and the loan in reality is a minimum
guaranteed income from his crop. If a target price is established for
a particular commodity, the government pays the farmer a "deficiency
payment" (the difference between the target price and the average
market price) if the market price falls below that target. Again, this
means the farmer has a minimum guaranteed income.
<P>
     The loan rates also establish a floor under the commodity price
and signal to the rest of the world what a foreign producer must
charge for his product to beat the American price. Because the U. S.
product is usually the higher-priced product in the international
export market, buyers often turn to the U.S. market only after first
exhausting the supplies offered by other exporters.
<P>
     Increasing Farm Incomes. Periods of export growth historically
have been periods of large income gain for U.S. farmers. In the early
1970s, for example, U.S. grain exports doubled in just four years.
According to J.B. Penn, then Deputy Administrator for Economics at the
U.S. Department of Agriculture, "net farm income reached the highest
level since World War II and parts of the agricultural sector enjoyed
nearly unparalleled prosperity." (D. Gale Johnson, ed., "Food and
Agricultural Policy for the 1980's," American Enterprise Institute for
Public Policy Research, 1981.)
<P>
     In the 1980s, on the other hand, the United States priced itself
out of international markets by setting too high a floor under
commodity prices in the 1981 farm bill. That legislation provided
automatic increases in loan rates to reflect the double-digit
inflation the country was experiencing at the time. These rigid
minimum loan rates effectively established a minimum export price.
(Farm legislation sets loan rates for major commodities which
establish a floor under the commodity price by allowing the producer
to choose to sell his crop and repay the loan or forfeit his crop to
the government and keep the money. The 1981 farm bill established
these loan rates with automatic escalators, which ultimately exceeded
the inflation rate. Rather than selling their crop which conceivably
could then have found their way to an export outlet, most producers
forfeited their crops to the government and kept the government loan,
which was higher than the prevailing world market prices.) Foreign
competitors undersold these artificially high prices, and U.S. exports
fell. 
<P>
     Domestic commodity prices fell even lower because the resulting
stockpile of surplus commodities continued to depress the markets.
Recognizing that the automatically escalating loan rates in the 1981
farm bill priced American agricultural producers out of the export
market, Congress provided flexibility to decrease loan rates in the
1985 farm bill. 
<P>
     Unfortunately, new mistakes were made in the 1985 farm bill.
Target prices were kept relatively high, which meant that U.S. farmers
became dependent on the federal government for an even greater share
of income. Rather than dealing with this budget concern directly, the
1985 farm bill called for a greater reliance on the use of acreage
reduction programs to control costs and created the Conservation
Reserve Program (CRP), also intended to reduce production available
for program eligibility, despite the fact that attempting to bolster
domestic farm prices by restricting supply severely limits the export
potential of U.S. farmers. Thus, after gaining a growing share of
world grain usage in the 1970s, U.S. farmers saw that share fall
significantly after the return to supply management policies in the
early 1980s.
<P>
     As in any other sector of the economy, a farm policy designed to
raise farm incomes should promote growth in world consumption and try
to capture a larger share of that consumption for U.S. exporters.
Fuller and more efficient use of production resources is the key to
this since it lowers unit costs and increases export revenues. In
short, greater and more efficient production increases total volume
and widens the margin of profit.
<P>
     A recent study commissioned by the National Grain and Feed
Foundation indicates that returning 38 million idled acres to
production could increase gross farm revenue by $8 billion and net
farm income by $4 billion. (Abel, Daft and Earley, an economic
analysis consulting firm, located in Alexandria, Virginia, conducted a
study on behalf of the U.S. Agriculture 20/20 Project of The National
Grain and Feed Foundation. The study "Large-Scale Land Idling Has
Retarded Growth of U.S. Agriculture," was released in May 1994.)
Taxpayers also would benefit from such increased production because
farmers would receive a greater share of their income from the
marketplace rather than from the federal government -- which for the
last 10 years has spent an average of some $14 billion annually on
commodity programs (see the above chart).
<P>
     Reinvigorating the Rural Economy. The federal government's supply
control policies have a widespread impact on the entire U.S. economy.
Stagnant economic activity in the U.S. agricultural sector leads to a
loss of jobs not just in farming, but also in the supply, processing,
and marketing industries. In addition, agribusinesses reduce their
investments of capital needed to replace obsolete equipment and fully
utilize technological advancements. This hits major businesses
producing such items as heavy farm equipment. Moreover, without
capital investment, the United States cannot be a dominant force in
processing and selling agricultural products internationally. 
<P>
     Changes in U.S. agricultural policy that stimulate greater
output, on the other hand, will give agribusiness the incentive to
invest in greater economic efficiency. Such a growth-oriented policy
would restore the United States as the world's premier farm producer
and exporter. It also would revive the vast and valuable agricultural
infrastructure, much of which -- though still surpassing that of other
countries -- has been allowed to deteriorate during the past decade. A
free market revolution thus would bring economic growth to rural
communities, generating jobs in businesses that provide inputs to
farmers and that process and market their crops. This expanded
economic activity could generate hundreds of thousands of jobs,
providing a much-needed boost to the rural economy.
<P>
     Increasing agricultural production also would have an impact on
the rest of the American economy. A multiplier effect would spread the
benefits of increased production from producers to processors and
distributors and would include the seed, fertilizer, chemical,
transportation, equipment manufacturing and construction industries.
Thus, the study commissioned by the National Grain and Feed Foundation
concludes that returning 38 million acres to production would not
merely boost farm income by $4 billion, but could "increase national
income by $28.9 billion annually and generate over 225,000 more full-
time jobs." (Ibid.)
<P>
A PRO-GROWTH FARM BILL IN 1995
<P>
     Ten years ago, the one significant reform in the 1985 farm bill
was based on a recognition that the United States, if it was to be a
successful agriculture exporter, had to allow farm prices to be
competitive. The 1995 farm bill could build on this by enabling
farmers to capture the benefits of agricultural trade reform.
<P>
     In order to capitalize on the future expansion of world trade,
the 1995 farm bill must promote and reward growth. The United States
produces more agricultural products than it can consume domestically,
and the gap between its production potential and its domestic demand
base is widening. Agricultural productivity will continue to advance
because of biotechnological breakthroughs and the use of such new
technologies as "site specific production." (When site-specific
production becomes available for commercial use, producers will be
able to use this satellite technology to maximize production by
applying the optimum amount of seed, fertilizer, and nutrients per
acre of cultivation.) 
<P>
     The first goal of the 1995 farm bill thus must be to enhance U.S.
agriculture's position as a competitive exporter. In an increasingly
competitive market, it is the low-cost producer that will capture new
markets and the resultant income. But supply controls and export
subsidies inhibit U.S. agriculture's ability to exploit its
competitive position. Specifically, in order to achieve a pro-growth
agricultural policy and realize the benefits that will flow from such
a policy, the following actions must be taken in the 1995 farm bill:
<P>
Eliminate all acreage reduction (ARP) or set-aside programs. 
<P>
     U.S. agricultural policy uses subsidy programs that rely
generally on supply control mechanisms instead of the market to
maintain farm income. For most of this decade, the United States has
been the only major farm producer to follow a policy of deliberately
idling productive land. More recently, the U.S. has persuaded the
European Union to begin similar supply control policies. This policy
does more than physically limit the amount of product available for
export, it also undermines the competitiveness of U.S. farm products
overseas because fixed production costs are spread across fewer
producing acres. This raises the farmer's cost of production per
bushel and leaves the established network of agricultural supply,
servicing, and processing industries to operate at a reduced capacity,
which raises handling costs and discourages maintenance and
reinvestment. Moreover, land idling tends to reduce demand for -- and
lower the prices of -- such things as seeds and fertilizers. When
these are exported because of limits on domestic production, the
result is lower production costs for America's competitors, who wisely
do not limit production.
<P>
Modify the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). 
<P>
     The CRP, authorized by the 1985 farm bill, was intended to target
erodible croplands for removal from production and to encourage
conservation. It now includes over 36 million acres on which
landowners receive rental payments under ten-year contracts in return
for removing the land from production. Much of this acreage actually
is highly productive land that, through utilization of readily
available conservation practices, is not vulnerable to unacceptable
erosion. The CRP contracts will begin to expire in 1995, and about
two-thirds will expire by 1997. A modified CRP should include only
highly erodible acres. Based upon USDA's land capability
classification system, about 22 million of the acres enrolled in the
CRP are in the top land capability classes with relatively low
erodibility. Only 4 million are highly erodible, while the remaining
10 million are of debatable erodibility.
<P>
     In the last twelve years, acreage reduction programs and the
Conservation Reserve Program have removed a total of almost 650
million acres from production. This would cover an area about four
times the size of Texas and is some 45 percent greater than the total
area of U.S. cropland annually under production, which is
approximately 450 million acreas (see the chart on the preceeding
page).
<P>
Eliminate the Export Enhancement Program (EEP). 
<P>
     The EEP pays exporters to dump agricultural products on the world
market at discounted prices by providing the exporter a dollar subsidy
price for specified quantities of commodities to be exported. Since
its inception, the EEP has been used primarily on grains. Previously,
the EEP was provided in the form of bonus commodities from CCC stocks.
Then, at least, the program added to exportable supplies. Now, even
that marginal benefit has disappeared.
<P>
     Such a program cannot be justified in a post-Uruguay Round world.
For one thing, the GATT agreement requires governments to cut back
such subsidies. For another, because export subsidies tend to
encourage sales of certain commodities by making the purchase of those
commodities relatively attractive, regardless of actual demand, they
distort markets to the disadvantage of the exporter with the greatest
growth potential, which is the United States. Because the EEP allows
the United States to continue temporarily to export products based on
an artificial stimulus rather than on real demand, it makes the U.S.
agricultural system sluggish and unresponsive and wastes resources
that could be used better elsewhere. 
<P>
     Continued use of export subsidies will serve only to depress
world grain and oilseed prices while distorting buyer-seller
relationships between countries. The elimination of export subsidies
on grain in particular would improve the global competitiveness not
only of grain, but also of oilseeds and livestock produced in the
United States.
<P>
     If these changes in U.S. farm policy are made, U.S. producers
will be the best positioned to serve growing world demand. By using
the natural advantages that enable it to be the low-cost producer, the
United States once again can become a successful exporter of
agricultural products.
<P>
OBSTACLES TO REFORM
<P>
     These reforms will not happen automatically, however. Certain
sectors of U.S. agriculture, such as the National Association of Wheat
Growers, National Cotton Council, and National Farmers Union, do not
seem to recognize the economic and job-creating opportunities created
by the new global marketplace. They believe that GATT will make U.S.
farmers more vulnerable to competition from imports. In fact, in
hearings held this past summer, a number of commodity and farm groups
claimed that GATT reforms will make it even more important to keep
present farm programs with little or no change in order to protect
U.S. agriculture from competition. (The House Agriculture Subcommittee
on General Farm Commodities held hearings in June and July of 1994 to
review the general outlook for the farm economy and commodity
programs.)
<P>
     Such reluctance to change is natural, since very few farmers have
ever known anything other than a system of subsidies and supply
controls. But if this siege mentality prevails, it will condemn U.S.
agriculture to stagnation while other countries enjoy the fruits of
new markets. Fortunately, in a recent survey of readers conducted by
Top Producer magazine, when asked their opinion of a proposal to
reform farm programs that would eliminate deficiency payments and set-
asides, 26 percent responded favorably. Although 31 percent were
opposed, 34 percent were interested but said they needed more
information. (Top Producer, opinion survey, conducted in February and
March 1994.) Some farmers evidently recognize that dependence on
government subsidies also subjects them to a lackluster future.
<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
     Entrepreneurial farmers and agricultural groups should join
forces with those agribusiness concerns that led the fight for NAFTA
and GATT. Much of agribusiness understands the economic benefits of
agricultural trade liberalization and reform. Through past experience
with short supply situations, they have learned that supply controls
and export subsidies undermine their ability to do business, both here
and abroad, and to provide jobs and prosperity in rural America. 
<P>
     A strong voice for a future based on opportunity, not
protectionism, is needed now more than ever. U.S. agriculture faces an
historic opportunity, as a result of NAFTA and GATT reforms, to
reestablish its preeminence in the world export market. If Congress
takes the actions necessary to establish America's position as the
world leader in meeting the growing demands of this new market, the
result will be decades of prosperity ahead for farmers and greater
economic growth and stability in rural America. 
<P>
     The 1995 farm bill provides the opportunity to make the necessary
changes in agricultural policy. Four or five more years likely will
pass before farm legislation is considered again. By then, farmers in
the rest of the world already will have taken advantage of the
opportunity to meet the demands of the global marketplace. Thus, if
this opportunity is missed, rural America will face a future of
continued economic stagnation.

<P>
CONGRESS DECIDING FUTURE OF AMERICA'S FARMERS
<P>
By John Frydenlund
<P>
 
<P>
 Everyone who buys food or pays federal taxes should be interested
in the coming congressional battle over the 1995 farm bill. The
issue is simple: Whether Congress will unleash the unrivaled productive
power of U.S. agriculture or keep U.S. farmers plodding along
under a tired, worn-out farm program created during the Great
Depression.
<P>
 The right decision could produce significant savings for both
consumers and taxpayers, while producing an estimated $35 billion
windfall for rural America.
<P>
 Gradually doing away with the current farm program over a five
year period -- and letting farmers produce for customers around
the world without interference from Washington -- is the way to
get there. The farm bill is the place to start.
<P>
 The prospect of generating $35 billion worth of new farm income
ought to be a powerful incentive for Congress to act, especially
considering how the new prosperity would be spread throughout
the country, according to a detailed computer model we put together
at The Heritage Foundation to measure the impact of phasing out
the farm program.
<P>
 While all states would benefit in the long-run, from California
to Florida, the greatest short-term benefits would be seen in
the midwest farm belt.  Five heartland states -- Colorado, Kansas,
 Missouri, Nebraska, and South Dakota -- would receive a healthy
$5.7 billion chunk of the increased farm income. This is after
factoring in added production costs and decreased &quot;deficiency
payments&quot; in which the government pays farmers the difference
between the market price and a government-imposed &quot;target
price&quot; or loan rate, whichever is smaller. By the way, the
following figures are for net income after the end of all federal
deficiency payments:
<P>
 * Colorado -- The Centennial State's wheat and corn producers
would see an $82 million increase by 2000, and a total of $1.05
billion more by 2005.
<P>
 * Kansas -- The Jayhawk State's wheat, corn, oats, barley and
soybean growers would receive $158 million in added net income
by the year 2000, and a cumulative total of more than $2.5 billion
by 2005.
<P>
 * Missouri -- Thanks to increased farm production nationwide,
the Show Me State's food processors, as well as Missourians growing
corn, soybeans and wheat, would enjoy $43 million in added net
income in five years, and $709 million by 2005.
<P>
 * Nebraska -- Farm machinery producers would share $25 million
in added net income by 2000 with ranchers and grain producers
in the Cornhusker State. By 2005, the state's farm sector  would
have received nearly $1 billion in increased income.
<P>
 * South Dakota -- Oat, flax seed, sunflower seed and rye growers
here would receive $21 million in added net income by 2000, and
more than $546 million total by 2005.
<P>
 Texas is another big winner. By 2000, the Lone Star State's wheat,
cotton, rice and peanut producers would see a $13 million increase,
but by 2005 the total would skyrocket to $1.08 billion.
<P>
 With such a cornucopia available, one naturally wonders why farmers
failed to reap such benefits before now? The answer is because
the United States has never weaned itself off the current system,
which was created in the 1930s to protect farmers from the volatility
of a Depression-era marketplace.
<P>
 Reform opponents are defending a costly, bureaucratic maze of
special interest subsidies, deficiency payments, price supports,
acreage allotments and red tape. Everybody but the politicians,
Department of Agriculture bureaucrats and a few richly favored
farmers will be big losers if Congress protects this creaky relic.
<P>
 This is because under the current farm program 65 percent of
all federal farm payments go to a mere 16 percent of farmers,
those with gross annual sales of $100,000 or more. Small farmers
-- those who sell less than $10,000 worth of farm products each
year -- receive only 5 percent of the payments.
<P>
  Worst of all, the current system forces farmers to plan, invest
and plant as if their only customers are the 250 million consumers
here in America, thus ignoring a growing worldwide food market
of 6 billion hungry people beyond the United States.
<P>
 If our farmers were instead free to plan for the near doubling
population and rising living standards in Asia, Africa and Latin
America in coming years -- where demand for food is expected to
triple -- there is no telling how much prosperity could be ahead.
<P>
 Members of Congress should understand that, if the 1995 farm
bill begins the process of eliminating government subsidies and
controls, America's farmers will be able to out-produce and outsell
the rest of the world, with the expanded production fueling tremendous
increases in farm income and in farm-related businesses. If Congress
keeps the subsidies and controls, farm prosperity will wither
on the vine for years to come.
<P>

<h2>Abolishing the Department of Education In Order to Liberate Parents and Schools</h2><p>
<h3>A Joint Statement by Former Secretaries of Education</h3><br>
<h3>Lamar Alexander and William J. Bennett</h3><p>
<i><b>Delivered before the House Economic and Educational 
Opportunities Committee, Subcommittee on Oversight and 
Investigation</i></b><br>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee: <p>
 
It is a particular pleasure for us to address this Committee with its 
new name, new majority and new chairman. Thank you for the 
opportunity to set forth our views on the federal role in education. 
You have an extraordinary opportunity to change the course of 
history in this domain. <p>
 
In this statement we outline a fundamental transformation; namely, 
reversing the direction of a mighty river that, for the past thirty 
years, has flowed in the direction of Washington, D.C. We have 
long been convinced that this river -- of responsibility, authority and 
accountability for American education -- should instead flow 
toward our families, schools, communities and states we sketch in 
this statement, and the principles on which they rest, are not new 
for us, for the Presidents we have served, or for many more of our 
fellow Republicans. What has changed is that it is finally within the 
capacity of the Congress to put them into action. <p>
 

<center><h3>What's Gone Wrong </h3></center><p>
 
The federal education apparatus illustrates what has gone awry in 
Washington over the past several decades. The national government 
has become meddlesome, intrusive and bullying. It now impedes 
more than it fosters. Much of what it mandates or encourages is 
misguided. It keeps people from doing what they know is right for 
their children, communities and states. It substitutes the rules of 
distant bureaucrats for the on-site knowledge of parents and 
teachers. And, particularly in the last several years, it has begun to 
lift from our communities the sense that they are responsible for the 
renewal and reform of American education and to suggest, instead, 
that Washington knows best and is taking charge. <p>
 
We and Presidents Reagan and Bush did all we could to reverse the 
flow, place the emphasis on states and communities, promote 
flexibility and choice, forge a true partnership with the governors, 
end discrimination against individuals without preferential treatment 
for any group, and halt Washington's growing regulatory apparatus. 
But every such effort was rebuffed by the Democratic Congress -- 
now aided and abetted by the Clinton administration -- which has 
pressed relentlessly in the opposite direction, encouraged in this 
endeavor by education's myriad special interest groups. <p>
 
To anyone who thinks we exaggerate, we recommend reading the 
full texts of Goals 2000 and "H.R.6", the administration's two main 
education bills -- particularly as these were finally enacted by the 
103rd Congress. Especially when they are taken in combination, it 
becomes plain that their authors 'want to substitute decisions made 
in Washington for decisions made by individual households and 
communities. They transform what had been a national movement 
into a federal program. They create new governance structures and 
regulatory mechanisms at both national and state levels. They use 
federal funding in a deceptive way that is designed to elicit the 
behaviors that other parts of the legislation declare to be 
"voluntary". They throw obstacles onto such promising reform 
pathways as school choice and private management of public 
schools. They strip the bi-partisan National Assessment Governing 
Board of much of its independence. And they do all this while pretending otherwise, by wrapping themselves in rhetoric of 
"helping" education and pasting friendly-sounding titles on the 
cover (H.R.6 was dubbed the "Improving America's Schools Act") 
while in reality their contents were written by and for lobbyists and 
interest groups to whom the skills and knowledge of children are 
not the top priority. <p>
 
Federal education policy has been moving in this direction since 
1965. It took a breather, at least within the executive branch 
between 1981 and 1992, but the past two years have seen the pent-
up "governmentalism" of that decade unleashed upon the land. For 
a time we supposed that it was possible to have a national 
education reform project that worked like a true and durable 
partnership and did not evolve into another rule-bound federal 
program. The last two years have proven us wrong. In addition to 
Goals 2000 and H.R.6, we have seen the executive branch give 
blanket endorsement to scholarships based on race; take the heat 
off those who would use "diversity" as a criterion for accreditation; 
propose the race-norming of state assessment results; and persecute 
states that employ test-based standards for high school graduation. 
It's now clear that the federal government will eventually break 
whatever it touches. Rather than tinker around the margins, 
therefore, the time has come for a great and thorough change. <p>
 

<center><h3>A Different Philosophy </center></h3><p>
 
The essential part of our proposal is not its particulars but the four 
principles on which it rests. It is these, above all, that we commend 
to the Committee's consideration. One can adjust the details that 
follow. Any comprehensive overhaul based on these principles, 
however, will represent fundamental redirection -- and an historic 
accomplishment, worth the new Congress. <p>
 
First, education in America is the constitutional responsibility of the 
states the social responsibility of communities, and the moral 
responsibility of families. <p>
 
Second, except when the civil rights of individuals are menaced, the 
federal government should never impede the capacity of families, 
teachers, communities and states to decide how best to provide 
education to their children, and should never substitute its judgment 
for theirs. <p>
 
Third, goals, standards, assessments, the dissemination of 
information and ideas, and the encouragement of bold innovation 
are legitimate leadership and "bully pulpit" activities of national 
officials, but they must always be truly voluntary on the part of 
states and communities. Nor should federal funds be used as 
"carrots" or "sticks" in ways that effectively diminish state and local 
control. <p>


Fourth, insofar as the federal government is engaged at all in the 
field of education, it should dedicate itself to (a) fostering family 
responsibility and local control; (b) assisting states to fulfill their 
responsibilities as they see fit; (c) providing sound statistics, prompt 
and accurate assessment results and other information; and (d) 
safeguarding individuals from illegal discrimination. <p>
 

<center><h3>Repairing Recent Damage </center></h3><p>

In the 1,200 or so pages of the Goals 2000 and H.R.6 legislation 
enacted last year is considerable mischief that should immediately 
be defunded and then repealed. Ten leading candidates include: <p>
 
1. The National Education Standards and Improvement Council -- 
the "national school board" that is so vivid a symbol of education 
wrong-think in Washington, and the new state panels mandated by 
Goals 2000. Our states and communities have all the governments 
they need; they don't need new decision-making structures designed 
in Washington. <p>
 
2. Federal ''certification'' of national and state education standards 
and federal approval of state and local education reform plans. 
Those controversial new standards should make their own way 
through the marketplace of ideas without any federal "seal of 
approval." Nor do federal bureaucrats have any business second-
guessing state and local priorities for school reform. <p>
 
3. Prohibitions and disincentives for state/local testing programs 
and accountability systems. Among the most dismaying features of 
Goals 2000 (and recent actions by the Office for Civil Rights) is the 
effort to discourage the very tests that might actually encourage our 
students to learn more -- and give parents and taxpayers better 
information. <p>
4. New "gender equity" programs. The last thing we need is the 
federal government telling America's 15,000 communities how to 
teach little boys and little girls about one another -- or mandating 
how teachers are to handle such matters. Nor do we need a new 
"special assistant for gender equity" to enforce such mandates. <p>
 
5. Federal regulation of schools' weapons policies and sex 
education. That's why we have parents, teachers, principals and 
school boards. <p>
 
6. All references to "opportunity to learn" standards. If the 
experience of American education these past thirty years has taught 
us anything, it's the importance of maintaining a laser-like focus on 
student achievement and of creating accountability systems that are 
based on school results. The recent legislation deflects attention 
back toward such "inputs" as spending levels, class size, and 
degrees conferred by colleges of education -- and invites even more 
litigation based on such spurious gauges while discouraging true 
accountability for schools, teachers and students. <p>


7. Disincentives for states and localities that want to try such 
reforms as vouchers, charter schools and privatization. If we are 
ever to transform American education, we must give families -- 
especially poor families -- the right to choose their children's 
schools from among all the schools in their communities; give 
communities opportunities to create "break the mold schools" that 
are not regulated to death by the bureaucracy; and invite the private 
sector to help interested communities create the best schools in the 
world. Yet the recent legislation places obstacles in the path of 
states and communities that want to try such things. -What sort of 
choice program allows the sending" school to deny children the 
right to leave? The sort enacted in H.R.6. <p>
 
8. Extension of Davis-Bacon provisions to school construction and 
renovation. That means a principal in Moline who wants to hire a 
contractor to rewire his school for new computers must pay the 
prevailing union wage rather than getting the job done for the 
lowest cost. It's a big favor for the unions, but no favor at all for 
schools, efficiency or economy. <p>
 
9. The addition of two more national goals to the original six. 
Parent involvement and teacher training are fine, but goals should 
be limited to specific, measurable results, such as President Bush 
and the Governors (including then-governor Bill Clinton) 
established in Charlottesville. <p>
 
10. Weakening the National Assessment Governing Board. Our 
best source of reliable student achievement data at the national and 
state levels is the National Assessment of Educational Progress, the 
integrity of which depends on the absolute independence and 
complete policy control of its Governing Board. H.R.6 undermined 
that board, giving greater influence to education interest groups and 
to a sluggish federal bureaucracy that is easily politicized. <p>
 

<center><h3>Reasons for Devolution</center></h3><p>
 
Mr. Chairman, here is the heart of our proposal for the long term: 
the Congress should take every single activity currently housed in 
the Department of Education and do one of three things with it: (a) 
send it home to the states and communities; (b) entrust it to another 
federal agency that is suited to conduct it in harmony with related 
activities; or (c) abolish it on grounds that the federal government 
can no longer afford to spend money on programs that have 
outlived their usefulness or that can be handled satisfactorily by 
others. We will not endeavor here to fill in every detail or answer 
each question that might be asked about this far-reaching 
recommendation, but the examples that follow indicate its main 
features. <p>
 
<center><h3>Sending responsibility home </center></h3><p>
 
* Virtually all major programs assisting elementary/secondary 
education should be combined into a "block" and returned to the 
states and communities. This can be accomplished in several ways: 
the best, in our judgment, is a "responsibility swap" whereby the 
states assume full responsibility for education in return for federal 
assumption of other burdens now borne by the states; or a resource 
base transfer in which some federal tax is reduced by an amount 
equivalent to the programs in question, thereby leaving it to state 
and communities to raise and deploy these revenues as they see fit. 
A third approach is a no-strings "block grant" of federal fund to the 
state, though we like this least because of the well-known tendency 
of block grants to grow strings as time passes. <p>
 
The core of this block are programs under the headings of 
"education reform" (including goals 2000), school improvement, 
education for the disadvantaged, bilingual education, and vocational 
and adult education -- approximately $10 billion in all. That means 
upwards of a billion dollars a year for a big state like California and 
about $200 million for a smaller one like Tennessee, funds that the 
state and its communities would be free to spend it for any 
educational purpose, including such innovations as charter schools 
and vouchers. (The distribution formula can retain the equity-
conscious fiscal effects of today's programs.) The federal 
government would no longer define legitimate education reform, 
nor would states and communities have to submit their plans to 
Washington for approval. <p>
 
We will leave it to the budget-and-appropriations process to 
determine whether the block should equal the sum of its antecedent 
programs, but we note that a number of governors have made clear 
their willingness to endure a funding reduction in return for the 
freedom to deploy the remainder as their states see fit. We also note 
that eliminating the heavy overhead and "middleman" costs of 
current categorical programs (at both federal and state levels) will 
concentrate more resources on teaching and learning. <p>
 
A block grant to the states should also combine a number of the 
smaller higher education programs, with the exception of the main 
student financial aid programs. These deserve serious consultation 
with the governors and persons knowledgeable about higher 
education and finance. Today, one out of two college students in 
America has a federal grant or loan, and helping needy students 
attend college is a national function worth preserving. But these 
programs are poorly managed, needlessly costly, and full of 
middlemen, each of which takes its cut. In the near term, we 
recommend transferring the main student aid programs to a federal 
agency with greater competence in handling complex financial 
transactions with millions of individuals (and in collecting what is 
owed the government). An obvious candidate is the Treasury 
Department, with its Internal Revenue Service. Over the longer 
term, additional student aid strategies should be fully explored, 
including devolution to the states and privatization. <p>
 
* Special education and rehabilitation services also warrant 
consultation with the governors. This is by far the largest 
"unfunded" education mandate, i.e. federal regulations require the 
expenditure by states and localities of many billions more than the 
federal aid provided. It would, therefore, be reasonable to 
incorporate these programs into the main elementary/secondary 
block grant. Alternatively, they could become a smaller block grant 
of their own. (Total current value: approximately $5.7 billion.) Or 
these programs could be transferred to the Department of Health 
and Human Services. <p>


We want to be clear on this point: protection of the civil rights of 
disabled individuals would remain a federal responsibility, to be 
carried out by the Justice Department. <p>
 

<center><h3>Transfers </center></h3><p>
 
* All civil rights enforcement would move to the Justice 
Department, with the admonition that it be vigorously carried out 
when discrimination against individuals is involved, but not used as 
a tool for granting or withholding rights and benefits on the basis of 
group membership. <p>
 
The gathering, analysis and reporting of education statistics would 
be placed under the jurisdiction of the National Education Goals 
Panel, consisting of governors, legislators, members of Congress 
and senior officials of the executive branch. Assessment of student 
achievement at the international, national and state levels would 
become the unambiguous responsibility of a rehabilitated National 
Assessment Governing Board, overseen in turn by the Goals Panel. <p>
 
* As noted above, any student aid programs not devolved to the 
states would move to a fiscal agency such as the Treasury 
Department, while any special education and rehabilitation 
programs not turned over to the states would move to the 
Department of Health and Human Services. <p>
 
* Indian education programs would be transferred to the Interior 
Department. <p>
 
A small number of federal programs that assist specialized 
institutions (e.g. Gallaudet College, Howard University) and are 
now the responsibility of the Education Department deserve 
scrutiny to see whether the present subsidy arrangements should 
continue. Insofar as they do, any of a number of executive branch 
agencies can oversee future resource transfers. <p>
 
<center><h3>Abolition </center></h3><p>
 
The Education Department currently manages about 250 separate 
programs. Perhaps fifty of these have entirely outlived their 
usefulness, or support activities that the federal government could 
beneficially stop subsidizing, or provide marginal aid for activities 
that are fundamentally the responsibility of others but have been 
maintained as federal "categorical" programs due to the strength of 
special interest lobbies. Such programs should be abolished or "de-
funded" and the savings returned to federal taxpayers. (We estimate 
these at $2 to 3 billion annually, i.e. as much as $15 billion over five 
years.) We will not here provide a complete list, but illustrative 
examples include federal technical assistance centers of several 
kinds, regional "educational laboratories," library support programs, 
literacy programs for prisoners, women's educational equity, law 
school clinical experience, Olympic scholarships and "star schools." <p>


Savings would also result from dismantling the regulatory 
infrastructure, including most of the costs of Education Department 
management (about $444 million) and the National Education 
Standards and Improvement Council. <p>
 

<center><h3>Structural Implications </center></h3><p>
 
Inasmuch as adoption of our substantive recommendations would 
leave  The Department of Education with nothing to do, there 
would be no need to retain it. <p>
 
Although any "news" coming out of our testimony may be that 
"two former education secretaries urge abolition of department they 
once headed," let us be clear that we did not come before the 
Committee to recommend a label change or symbolic beheading. <p>
 
Today's Department of Education has two essential failings. First, it 
has come to contain bad ideas, harmful practices, needless 
expenditures, obsolete programs, dysfunctional regulations and the 
depredations of special interests that care more about the well-
being of education's "producers" than for its "consumers." <p>
 
Second, it has an irresistible and uncontrollable impulse to stick its 
nose into areas where it has no proper business. Most of what it 
does today is no legitimate affair of the federal government. The 
Education Department operates from the deeply erroneous belief 
that American parents, teachers, communities and states are too 
stupid to raise their own children, run their own schools and make 
their own decisions. <p> 
Abolishing the Department will accomplish little if its meddlesome 
ways are transferred intact to another federal bureaucracy. Indeed, 
such a shift could even be harmful to the extent that it serves to 
"hide" those activities in less visible locations. In our view, the way 
to think about the Education Department is first in terms of what it 
does, then in terms of its structure and status. <p>
 
Because we believe that each of the Department's activities that is 
worth preserving in some form could better be handled elsewhere, 
we see no need for a separate federal education agency of any kind. <p>
 
Our purpose is not to reduce the attention that the nation pays to 
education. Indeed, there's never been a time in our history when 
education was more important -- or more in need of a complete 
overhaul. Whether one is concerned with developing virtue in the 
young, preparing tomorrow's adults for life in the information age, 
widening the shared core knowledge base of a diverse population, 
strengthening our economic competitiveness or enabling poor 
people to move from the back of the line to the front, we have few 
assets of greater value than effective education. <p>


"National leadership" can be helpful in focusing people on problems 
and opportunities. We look to the President, with the help of an 
education advisor housed in the White House, to the National 
Education Goals Panel to ensure that the national project of 
educational renewal continues apace. But true leadership means 
energizing people and communities change, not shackling them with 
mandates and regulations -- and calling it leadership. We do not 
need a raft of federal programs. We do not need a giant 
bureaucracy. We do not need a federal department. What we need 
is a national movement. We are convinced that the-- prospects for 
such a movement -- and for real educational renewal in America -- 
will be far brighter when the Congress signals unmistakably and 
irrevocably that responsibility rests with teachers and parents, with 
communities and states, not with federal bureaucrats. <p>
 
Reversing the flow of this river is no small undertaking. But it 
would do immeasurable good for our children, our schools, our 
communities and our future. <p>

<H3> CANDIDATES FOR RESCISSION IN THE FY 1995

     We are here today to determine ways to cut the 1995 education
budget. Let me say at the outset that, despite rhetoric to the contrary, only
a very small percentage of the over $31 billion the federal government
spends on education ever actually makes it into America's classrooms. Most
of the Department of Education's budget and programs go to fund technical
assistance, clearinghouses, information, and specific programs that educators
in our states and communities neither need nor want. I spend a good amount
of my time working with educators in these states and communities. When
asked what the federal government and the U.S. Congress can do to improve
their schools, they overwhelmingly reply, "Leave us alone!"
<P>
     Federal funding for education has tripled in constant dollars from
1965 to the present. Student performance, by contrast, has declined over the
same period. Clearly, additional federal spending on education is not the
answer. Yet, the Clinton Administration, in its 1995 budget, sought $26.1
billion in discretionary budget authority, a $1.7 billion increase over last
year. Similarly, the Administration sought $5.6 billion for mandatory
programs, an increase of $1.1 billion over the $4.5 billion spent in 1994.
They sought a total increase in budget authority from $28.8 billion to $31.7
billion, an increase of $2.8 billion or 9.9 percent.
<P>
     The appropriation for the Department of Education has more than
doubled in the last fourteen years from around $15 billion to over $31
billion. From 1981-1992, the amount the U.S. Congress appropriated for the
Department of Education was actually greater than the amounts that
Presidents Reagan and Bush requested in their budgets every single year.
Since President Clinton has taken office, the President's request for the
Department of Education has exceeded the appropriation. It is also
interesting to note that the amount spent by the Department of Education for
post-secondary education (programs that include student loans, Pell Grants,
research grants, etc.) was greater than the amount spent on elementary and
secondary education from 1981-1990. This was because the original role of
the federal government in education was to ensure access to post-secondary
education and to fund research programs. The Clinton Administration has
reversed this historical breakdown and now spends more on elementary and
secondary education than on post-secondary education. This is unfortunate
since a greater percentage of federal spending on post-secondary education
actually helps individual students gain access to education. By contrast, most
of the federal money spent on elementary and secondary education goes to
fund the education bureaucracies and comes with burdensome mandates to
the state and local education agencies. Students benefit only from a very
small percentage of federal government spending on elementary and
secondary education.
<P>
     The goal of the 104th Congress, both in rescissions for the 1995
budget and in authorizations for future years, must be to evaluate each and
every one of the over 240 Department of Education categorical programs
(up from 140 programs in 1980) and determine whether these programs
actually improve the education of our children. The Congress also must
consolidate effective programs, eliminate ineffective programs, and stop
funding programs that benefit bureaucracies. To meet these ends, Congress
should make the following specific reforms:
<P>
End Several Programs. The Clinton Administration proposed cutting 34
categorical programs from the Department of Education. The 103rd
Congress cut only 13 of the programs. The 104th Congress should start by
rescinding funding for the remaining programs, including: the Ellender
Fellowships (Close-Up Foundation), Education for Native Hawaiians,
Foreign Language Assistance, Consumer and Homemaking Education, State
Student Incentive Grants, the Dwight D. Eisenhower Leadership Program,
Cooperative Education, Assistance to Guam, College Housing and Academic
Facilities Loan Program, Public Library Construction, Library Literacy
Programs, Library Education and Training, Library Research and
Demonstrations, Foreign Periodicals Program, Impact Aid 3(b) Payments,
Educational Partnerships Program, Immigrant Education, Dropout Prevention
Demonstrations, Vocational Education Community Based Organizations, and
Civics Education.
<P>
Change Recently Enacted Programs. There were four major education
programs either created or reauthorized in 1993 and 1994. All of these
programs, including Goals 2000: Educate America Act, reauthorization of
federal elementary and secondary programs in the Improving America's
Schools Act, the Federal Direct Student Loan program, and the National
Service Trust Act of 1993 should be revisited.
<P>
Goals 2000: Educate America Act
President Clinton proposed spending $700 million in 1995 for Goals 2000,
an increase of $595 million over the 1994 level. He called for $1 billion a
year for this program, to continue indefinitely, beginning in fiscal year 1996.
Congress appropriated $403.4 million, up 298.4 percent from the $105
million appropriated in 1994. The Clinton Administration claims that states
must distribute 85 percent of their Goals 2000 grants to local educational
agencies which must then use the money to "create and implement content,
performance, and opportunity-to-learn standards in academic areas, improve
professional development and licensure, and improve curricula and teaching
practices in individual schools." Goals 2000 funds go to three new
educational bureaucracies: the National Education Goals Panel, the National
Education Standards and Improvement Council (NESIC), and a National
Skills Standards Board. None of these activities, despite rhetoric to the
contrary, will improve local schools. Many of these activities are merely
new mandates put on the states and localities. This ineffective program will
become much larger, more bureaucratic, and more expensive unless it is
downsized and eventually eliminated through the appropriations process.
<P>
Reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Schools Act
 <P>    There are many areas in which funding can be cut and rescinded in
this expansive program. President Clinton requested $10.281 billion in his
1995 budget, and Congress appropriated $9.94 billion, a $475 million
increase from 1994. Much of this money goes to fund bureaucracies and
should be cut, including: the Eisenhower Professional Development
Program, Arts in Education, Eisenhower Professional Development Federal
Activities, Women's Educational Equity Fund for Improvement of
Education, Indian Elementary and Secondary Education, and the Ready to
Learn Act, among others. Congress should also alter the expansive Title I
program, perhaps giving the money directly to poor parents in the form of
educational vouchers that they can then use at the school of their choice.
<P>
The Federal Direct Student Loan Program
<P>     This act has done nothing to reduce the complexity of administering
student loans, eliminate unnecessary costs, and provide better service to
students and schools. Despite rhetoric to the contrary, the Department of
Education has hired 600 new employees to administer the direct loan
programs and anticipates hiring 20,000 contract employees when the phase-
in of the program is completed. Congress should cap this program, which
has gone from being an "experimental" program when passed to a
"transitional" program. All new funding for this program should be
rescinded.
<P>
 The National Service Trust Act of 1993<P>
This act created a new bureaucracy, the Corporation for National and
Community Service, and a new entitlement for middle-class students. In
1995, Congress appropriated $575 million for National Service activities,
included in eight programs. This is an increase of $205 million from the
1994 appropriation. These numbers do not include the $791.8 million
appropriated in 1995 for the five programs operating under the Corporation
for National and Community Service. This amount is an increase of $216.4
million from the $575.4 million appropriated in 1994. These funds should
either be eliminated through rescission or merged into means-tested work
study and Pell Grant programs.<P>
Eliminate Institutional Aid. There are currently seven programs, totaling
$229.7 million, that aid specific institutions. Congress increased the
authorization for these institutions by $16.7 million in 1995. These programs
should be eliminated. Similarly, Congress currently appropriates $193
million to Howard University for the endowment and research programs. No
other university in this country receives such a high level of federal support.
The appropriations for Howard should be rescinded and eliminated, and the
university should rely on private sector support as do all other major private
universities.
<P>
     It is impossible, given the time constraints, to go into all of the other
programs that should be merged, eliminated, or rescinded. However, the
104th Congress should consider merging the many higher education grant
and campus-based programs into one grant, one loan, and one work study
program. It should reevaluate many of the programs falling under the
category of "Educational Research and Improvement" since many of these
programs do little to help educate children. It should privatize the student
loan collection program; revisit, eliminate, and consolidate many Chapter 2
block grant programs; and review and cut many of the categorical programs.
The appropriations committees will ultimately make many of the decisions
on which programs to eliminate. This subcommittee has the power actually
to improve American public education by eliminating many of the programs
containing the mandates and regulations that have strangled innovation for
the past 15 years.

<h2>Education Reform: Putting Power in Parents</h2>
<i><b>A column by Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin</i></b> 
</center>
<hr>
<br> 
As parents and members of a community, one of the greatest  
responsibilities we have is to educate our children. <p>
As the proverb goes, "It takes an entire village to raise a child." And there  
is perhaps no greater duty for that "village" than to make sure its children  
gain the knowledge, skills and confidence to succeed as adults and  
contribute to their community. <p>
Yet as parents and as a community, we have surprisingly little control 
over how our children are educated. Parents and communities are not 
given the tools or the authority they need to make sure their children are 
succeeding in the classroom. <p>
Currently the power and control over educating our children rests in  
Madison. We have an antiquated, centralized system of education where  
faceless bureaucrats decide how your child should be taught, then place a  
plethora of mandates on local school districts. These mandates tie the  
bands of parents and community leaders who want to have a real voice in  
the education of their children, and they stifle innovation and creativity in  
the classroom. <p> 
In short, the current education system trusts government more than it  
trusts parents and communities. <p> 
Somewhere along the way, government responsibility replaced parental  
responsibility. Somewhere along the way, the bureaucracy became more  
important than the children. Somewhere along the way, defending the  
status quo took precedence over pursuing innovation and improvement. <p> 
No more. The challenge now facing our state is to make the needed  
changes to our education system to put power back into the hands of  
parents, school boards, classroom  teachers and local taxpayers. <p> 
We need to put our trust back into the "village," empowering our parents  
and communities to decide what is best for our children's education.  
trusting parents -- what a radical idea. <p> 
If Thorpe is facing a problem with its schools, I trust that the people of  
Thorpe are best equipped to resolve that problem, not a group of  
bureaucrats in Madison. <p> 
When it comes to education, one size does not fit all. We must give local  
communities the flexibility to meet the unique needs of their children. <p> 
My budget provides an array of initiatives that will facilitate the shift in  
power over education from Madison to our local communities. This starts  
with building a new education structure for the state. The current  
bureaucracy is too mired in the past to change and too self-serving to  
seriously pursue a better way.  <p> 
The new Department of Education proposal in the budget will serve as a  
catalyst for change to a system that cares more about the future of our  
children than about the future of bureaucratic jobs -- a system that trusts  
parents, not government. <p> 
The Department of Education's role will be clear: serve the public. The  
department will help set educational standards for the state and make sure  
our children are meeting those standards (via testing, etc.), but otherwise  
it will step aside and give local communities the flexibility to teach their  
children as they see fit. <p> 
Parents, school boards, teachers, community leaders and local  
taxpayers will work together to chart the best course for their children to  
meet the state's educational standards. The Department of Education  
will serve as a resource center, there to help communities when asked. <p> 
The budget also includes unique programs that meet the same goal of  
giving more control over education to the local community. <p> 
The charter schools initiative gives every community in the state the  
ultimate in flexibility to design schools to meet their unique needs. This  
initiative allows -- and encourages - communities to be innovative and  
visionary in meeting its children's needs. <p>
The public school choice proposal would allow every parent the choice of  
which public school to send their child. If a parent is unhappy with their  
child's school, they would now have a choice. There's no doubt that this  
will help improve the overall quality of all our public schools. <p> 
For Milwaukee only, we would allow low-income parents to send their  
child to a private school if they so choose. With nearly half of the  
students in Milwaukee Public Schools failing to graduate we need to try  
radical ideas that empower parents, particularly poor, minority parents.  
Remember, we all pay the consequences when a young man or woman  
fails to graduate and subsequently falls into a life of government  
dependence. <p> 
This budget is dedicatcd to the pursuit of excellence in education. making  
sure our children can compete -- and win -- in the global marketplace. <p> 
We need to restore some common sense to our education system, and that  
begins with returning power to parents and communities. <p>
When Milwaukee Public Schools Superintendent Howard Fuller resigned  
recently, he recited the words of William Daggett, who I believe puts our  
education priorities in the proper perspective.  <p> 
Daggett said, "We must love our children's hopes, dreams and prayers  
more than we love the institutional heritage of the school system." <p> 
In short, we need to return power to the village so its people can  
properly raise our children. We need to trust parents and communities,  
not government. <p>

<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
&quot;The enactment of the Goals 2000: Educate America Act and

<title>Heritage Lecture: Getting Gov't Out of Higher Education -- Heritage </title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><b>Heritage Lecture No. 533

<h3>Getting Government Out of Higher Education</h3>
<p>
By Jon Westling
Provost and President-elect, Boston University, delivered May 3, 1995
<p>

One of the pleasures of visiting Washington is the sense of reassurance which gleams from the limestone and marble buildings, the Capitol dome, and the sober monuments. Those of us who live and work far outside the Beltway sometimes need that reassurance, which is a little like the need parents feel when leaving a son or daughter in the safekeeping of a university. After eighteen years of the hard and loving work of raising a child, parents rightly expect a college to be vigilant, caring, and prudent. Nonetheless, as the station wagon pulls away from the curb in front of the dormitory, many a parent suppresses a shudder at what may actually lie ahead.<p>
That feeling is particularly familiar to me because less than a week ago, Boston University submitted an important set of forms to the Department of Education:  our application for continued certification to participate in "Title IV Student Financial Aid Programs."  Except in certain government agencies, of course, eight or nine pounds of paperwork is not the equivalent of a child, but I do feel a certain parental responsibility to this certification homunculus. Boston University labored over it for fourteen weeks and spent about 2,700 hours of employee time feeding it data. We stayed up nights when it had the colic, and we even changed it frequently, as we found that the bureaucrats at DOE who devised the 26 separate schedules hadn't bothered to consult over definitions such as what constitutes an "academic program." <p>

 Anyway, we have now entrusted our little bundle to the DOE and, like the parents in the station wagon, are putting a brave face on our fears. We have confidence that those DOE people are scrupulous and that it was somehow our own fault that it took 2,700 hours --       almost 1 1/2 man-years -- to complete the form, since those scrupulous DOE folk say right on page three of the instructions, "the estimated time to complete the application is three hours." <p>

 The instructions also say, "Most institutions will have the information required for the  application readily available."  This, I admit, is a little more worrisome. I grant that my experience as a university administrator is limited entirely to twenty years at Boston University, so it may be that other colleges and universities routinely permute data on admissions and financial aid according to six or seven disparate formulas. We don't, but Boston University will be able to catch up now that DOE has shown us this remarkable productivity-enhancing tool. <p>

Filling in this application helped Boston University accomplish one of the goals of education:  It made us a little more self-aware. We now know, for example, that of the 35,979 students who enrolled in at least one Boston University course in 1994, precisely ten did not possess a high school diploma. Thanks to the DOE, our cup runneth over with such factoids -- although, I admit, we are not entirely sure what most of them have to do with our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. One would think DOE would observe that our default rate on guaranteed student loans is 4.7 percent, which is 21.3 percent below the so-called "cohort-default rate threshold," and that would be that. <p>

The United States is, by any account, the world's leader in higher education. It has achieved that status by building in the last two hundred years a tremendously diverse array of independent colleges and universities which grew up with distinct educational philosophies and missions. Many were begun by religious denominations, others by self-educated visionaries, some by businessmen and entrepreneurs concerned with the need for educated workers. Typically, they adopted the form that Thomas Jefferson gave to the University of Virginia:  They were governed by boards of trustees charged with making sure the institution lived up to its educational mission. <p>

A lot has changed, little of it for the better. Higher education today is beset with self-inflicted problems. The wrenching of curricula to fit the bizarre doctrines of multiculturalism has left a dislocated and miseducated generation of college graduates. At all-too-many     supposedly elite campuses, students imbibe the theory of writing but can't write beyond a junior high school level. At more than a few universities, we have the shameful spectacle of students -- and faculty members -- shouting down speakers whose views they find exceptionable. Faculty unions, tenured layabouts, charging grant overhead for floral arrangements -- the sweet whiff of corruption -- all these derelictions of responsibility are now well-known, especially to this audience. Tempting as it is, however, I have not come here today to bury these faults deeper in obloquy. <p>

For, in addition to the self-inflicted wounds, higher education bears some other bruises. I draw your attention to the Good Samaritan who thrashes us with a club each time one of us staggers to his feet. I refer, of course, to the federal government and its handy cudgel, the Department of Education. <p>

The DOE no doubt means well. Congress has asked it to fix the problem of soaring default rates in the federally insured student loan program. The problem itself is not intractable, but the combination of experts and tools and instructions which Congress and DOE have assembled is cause for some apprehension. Imagine balancing your checkbook with the aid of three economists, a socket wrench, a can of spray paint, and a copy of Black's Law Dictionary, and you will have some sense of the situation. I'll come to the details in a minute. If matters proceed in this fashion, we still will not have a balanced checkbook, but government bureaucrats will be in charge of virtually every detail of what colleges and universities do. <p>

In speaking of threats, I do not mean to sound like the moping owl in the ivy-mantled tower who "does to the moon complain."  Along with the threats, there are some great opportunities, and this is an occasion to point those out too. If we can pull back from the brink, we will find that American higher education still has tremendous potential to contribute to the vigor, the intellectual and spiritual richness, and the prosperity of American life. <p>

But the brink is real. American higher education is on the verge of losing its most precious asset. It is abandoning or being forced to abandon its robust independence, and it will fade into something worse than mediocrity if the government's regulatory assault is not stopped. <p>

Before describing that regulatory rampage, I should say a word or two about my perspective. "Never confess, never, never confess," says Joseph Conrad's deeply observant man of the sea, Marlowe. I will nonetheless divulge that I was a civil rights protester in the early 1960s. I retain a strong conviction that society can change for the better and that government has an important part to play in that process. I agree with Edmund Burke that, "A state without the means of some change is without the means of its conservation," and that to criticize is one thing, but "at once to preserve and to reform is quite another." <p>

Until the 1960s, the federal government intruded very little into university management. The GI Bill and the research funding that followed World War Two were accompanied by surprisingly little red tape. Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, however, changed this. By     establishing numerous programs designed to expand access to higher education, the federal government became enmeshed in the attempt to re-shape higher education. <p>

Many of these programs had broad bipartisan and public support. At first, the reams of new government regulations seemed a harmless enough price for programs that promised to benefit everyone, including colleges and universities. Few had the foresight to see that, over the next thirty years, Congress would transform programs meant to open doors to educational opportunities into welfare systems. <p>

Federally insured student loans, for example, were designed with the help of conservative legislators as a means of providing greater access to higher education with a minimum of government involvement. Initially, they expanded opportunity on an equal basis, assisting anyone who met the usual criteria for getting into college. Over these thirty years, however, they have been increasingly used by the government as a low-visibility way to  subsidize selected institutions. <p>

The program began with default rates comparable to those accepted by commercial    lenders. In 1972, the government lifted the ceiling beyond what any commercial lender would tolerate -- and, finding it was good, lifted it again in 1976, in 1978, and in 1983. It is now 25 percent for most institutions and more for "historically black colleges and universities [and] tribally-controlled community colleges."  The average default rate at proprietary schools is over 30 percent. <p>

At the same time, the government began lowering the minimum academic standards   necessary to qualify for loans. Today, neither a high school diploma nor equivalency exam is required for taking out a federally guaranteed loan for what is called "post-secondary" education. Finally, the default rates have soared partly because the government is unwilling to require "disadvantaged" members of society to pay back the loans. <p>

In short, today's student loan crisis is largely the result of permitted defaults by unqualified students who borrowed money to attend vocational schools which provided inadequate education and few job prospects. <p>

Neither universities nor private lenders would have, on their own, permitted the student loan crisis. The key ingredient was Congress, which insisted that the real decisions about who would receive the student loans would be made by the federal government. This is one instance of how the federal government's attempts to direct higher education have gone awry. I do not have time to present anything like a systematic account of the destruction Congress has wrought in this area in the last three decades, but I will try to give you a Cook's tour of the most monumental follies. Our first stop has been the Great Converge,  formerly known as the Great Divide. Rivers once flowed east and west from this point. Institutions, ideas, and people went their separate ways. But Congress, through some elegant diversions, has now ensured that everything flows to Washington. <p>

I should also like to suggest some ways in which these monuments to folly can be replaced with the verdant fields and pleasant vistas of good sense. In the case of federally insured student loan programs, good sense points in one clear direction. The programs should again be made commercially viable. The exemptions for those institutions which are allowed to exceed the 25 percent default rate should be abolished, and the tolerated default rate should be lowered to a commercially acceptable level. No student who is not a high school graduate or who has not passed a high school equivalency examination should be  considered qualified for federally insured student loans. <p>

New educational institutions or ones which have exceeded the default rate threshold should be required to put up an insurance bond to protect against future loan defaults. I would add to this that tuition refund regulations should be clearly defined; the current state of confusing formulae leads to abuse. <p>

We should take a close look at the patterns of abuse and respond accordingly. Physicians, for example, are close to the top in the rankings of those who default on student loans. This could be corrected almost overnight by barring Medicaid and Medicare reimbursements to doctors who default on their student loans and who fail to make amends within one year. That principle can be extended. Loan recipients who default and fail to make amends within one year should be barred from receiving any federal funds or contracts. <p>

These initiatives will return student loan programs to what was originally intended:  expanded educational opportunity at modest cost. In 1970, the taxpayer's bill for guaranteed student loans was $2.3 million on a volume of $770 million. In 1993, the bill had grown to $5 billion on a volume of $18 billion. Adjusted to 1993 dollars, the cost to taxpayers per  dollar loaned has risen from about .28 cents in 1970 to 28 cents in 1993. That is a 9,900 percent increase. <p>

If we knew then what we know now, or if the clock could be turned back thirty years,  perhaps we would not choose to go down the road of federally insured student loans. In that case, there would be far fewer colleges and universities, and there would be far fewer students at those which remained. But this is like wishing for a United States with an agrarian economy. We can't undo the past. This society has made a commitment to mass higher education. The attempt to reel in the percentage of the young who attend college to a European or Japanese level is not politically feasible, even in the unlikely event that we   decided it would be a good idea. <p>

Besides, as we have seen, there are simple ways in which the federally insured student loan crisis can be -- and should have been -- solved. Unfortunately, Congress and the Department of Education had an entirely different idea. They responded by adding yet more bureaucratic regulation and by making the programs even less commercially viable. The most intrusive part of this misguided response involves university and college accreditation. <p>


I approach this topic with a little trepidation. H.L. Mencken once called the Bible Belt "the Sahara of the Beaux Arts."  Accreditation is something like the Death Valley of the life of the mind. It is a dusty plain, leagues below the sea level of normal human cogitation, inhabited by scorpions and sidewinders. I could tell tales of college administrators stranded in this desperate landscape and languishing after mirage oases labeled "the assessment movement" and "teaching portfolios."  But that's for another time. What I am concerned with now is the invasion of the dirt-bikers. <p>

Accreditation at its best puts quacks out of business, but it is more typically a technique used by professional interests to feather their own nests. The most egregious example is the American Bar Association, which has a stranglehold on American legal education. Many of the ABA accreditation rules have only gossamer connections to the quality of legal education, but all of them have a laser-like focus on the perquisites of being a law professor -- down to specifying the number of square feet in each faculty member's office. You can get a fair picture of the world of specialized accreditation by imagining 250 or so would-be ABAs, each carping for a finer grade of ivory in its part of the tower. <p>

When all is said and done, however, we university administrators have a certain grudging respect for the specialized accreditors. Some know their business, and at worst they are driven by old-fashioned greed. In any case, specialized accreditors do not come close to the other great branch of academic accreditation, the regional accreditation agencies, for exemplifying lassitude, incompetence, and day-to-day bewilderment, combined with a solemn sense of rectitude and, of course, a desire to augment their authority. I realize that that description could apply rather well to several government agencies, but the regional accreditation agencies are not -- or not quite -- part of government. They are part of that shadowy world of quasi-governmental agencies which enjoy governmental authority but are largely unaccountable. <p>

The six regional accreditation agencies, which accredit whole institutions rather than   specific programs, gain their prominence from the stipulation that only accredited colleges and universities can participate in federal financial aid programs, including the Title IV    student loan programs. <p>

In 1992, when Congress recognized that default rates had gotten out of hand, it observed, correctly, that some of the worst offenders were schools that it had exempted from the   loan-default rate ceilings, along with a small number of proprietary schools. You and I could probably think of several solutions to this problem. I've sketched some of those earlier. But it's unlikely that in our most demented fantasies we would come up with the particular answer that Congress wrote into the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1992. Instead of merely shutting off the spigot to the offending institutions, Congress decided to turn the      regional accreditation agencies into an enforcement wing of the Department of Education. <p>

Instead of isolating problem institutions and kicking them out of the program, it told accreditation agencies that they would be responsible for fixing the problem, on pain of losing their ability to operate. This brings us to our current pass, in which the Department of Education and several of the accreditation agencies, operating under the curious but imposing title "The National Policy Board," have developed a proposal to nationalize accreditation. <p>

The arid landscape of accreditation is now roaring with joy-riding regulators, the dirt-bikers of Death Valley. Again, the solution is common sense. Congress must intervene to keep government from taking over accreditation. The linkage between accreditation and the    Department of Education must be broken, and the government-mandated monopoly of    accreditation agencies should be abolished. <p>

I can think of several very concrete things Congress could do to bring some sanity back to this process. First, Congress should change the Higher Education Act Amendments of 1992 to eliminate the requirement that higher education accrediting agencies themselves be accredited. This requirement is at the bottom of DOE's attempt to take over accreditation and of the National Policy Board's attempt to nationalize the system. <p>

Accreditation agencies should be, in effect, accredited by their customers. If they have anything worthwhile to offer colleges and universities, colleges and universities will pay them for it. Generally, colleges and universities will pay to be reviewed by the agency which has the strictest standards that the institution thinks it can pass. A free market in accreditation agencies will quickly stratify, with the toughest agencies attracting the best colleges and universities. The public will benefit from a genuine ranking system. <p>

Congress should eliminate the link between accreditation and eligibility for federal funds, including federally guaranteed student loans (Title IV). Accreditation should be about the quality of academic programs, not about the rate at which students default on government-backed loans. <p>

Congress should also stipulate that the Department of Education has no role to play in   accrediting institutions of higher education. The DOE has made clear that it is not a good judge on issues of academic quality, and the prospect of its telling others how to promote academic quality is grimly amusing. <p>

Let us leave Death Valley. I have a great deal of hope that the current Congress will undo the mischief of years past, but it is a vast and bleak landscape, and relief is long overdue. The next stop on this tour is the Old Growth Forest, a place of deep calm, even torpor, where the government has decided there will be no harvesting of even the most mature trees. The Old Growth Forest lies in pleasant Tenure County. The deep calm exists because those who live there know that no matter how feeble their performance, how desultory their efforts to keep up with the times, and how pressing the need to start new seedlings, Congress has determined they can stay put so long as they can breathe. <p>

As of January 1994, universities and colleges are no longer permitted to have a mandatory retirement age for faculty. This intrusion into the terms of faculty employment nominally makes professors like workers in any other sector of the economy. But in reality, it does nothing of the kind, because no other part of the economy is encumbered with the tenure system. This law has effectively given tenured faculty a lifetime appointment. <p>

The problem clearly has two sides. Universities and colleges should be seeking ways to  reform or abolish tenure. The traditional legs on which tenure stands are economic security and academic freedom. Economic security is a fine thing, but in universities it should never trump competence. And the major threats to academic freedom today come not from a repressive society but from repressive ideologies espoused mostly by those who live under the cover of tenure. Boston University successfully abolished tenure in its Medical and  Dental Schools in 1973, and we have been making some inroads in other areas since, most recently by offering some faculty members long-term contracts instead of tenure. It is,   however, a hard nut to crack. A single institution has to have powerful attractions to recruit individuals who have the possibility of guaranteed lifetime employment at a competing institution. <p>

By outlawing mandatory retirement for faculty, the government is making the effort to eliminate tenure even more difficult, and it is -- inadvertently -- closing opportunities for many other people. The life of most senior faculty members is generally not so strenuous. Many faculty members are willing to keep going in the absence of a stick or a carrot that gives them some incentive to stop. The result is that there is less turnover and fewer positions for faculty members who are attempting to establish their careers. <p>

 The Old Growth Forest is getting older. Congress must repeal the law which prohibits universities and colleges from setting mandatory retirement ages for faculty. <p>

The enxt stop on our tour is the High Plateau, the setting for a wonderful new institution, Learning Disabled University. LDU got its start from laws designed to prohibit discrimination against the handicapped. The Americans With Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act are being used -- perhaps contrary to legislative intention, but nonetheless -- to force colleges and universities to lower academic standards. <p>

Children are now reaching college having been swaddled for years in the comforting illusions of learning disabled theory. Enormous numbers of students in grade school and high school have been diagnosed "learning disabled."  In Massachusetts, almost one in five      students is crammed into this category. The national average is twelve percent. Are we in the midst of a silent genetic catastrophe? <p>

LDU is trying to keep LD philosophy students safe from the perplexities of Aristotle, to accommodate foreign language majors who have foreign language phobia, and to comfort physics students who suffer from dyscalculia, which is, of course, the particular learning   disablement that prevents one from learning math. <p>

I do not wish to imply that Boston University has escaped all the moonbeams illuminating campuses coast to coast. A month or so ago, I discovered that our Office of Disability Services had, without permission, begun issuing exemptions from the language and math  requirements on precisely the bases I described. I put a stop to it, and now I await as intrepidly as a brewer of hot coffee the lawsuits that are sure to follow. I think, for example, of the suit against Tufts University, filed by a student who claimed that Tufts was required  under the ADA to accommodate her psychological disability, which consisted of an aversion to taking tests. <p>

Nor do I wish to mislead you by suggesting that Learning Disabled University is entirely the province of students and their LD counselors. I think, for example, of the former philosophy professor that Boston University fired after finding him guilty of sexually assaulting another faculty member and of forcing his attentions on three undergraduate students. He responded with the novel defense that his lecherous behavior was the result of a disability:  namely, inhibitions chronically lowered by his ingestion of prescription drugs. He is now   suing Boston University, claiming that his behavior was protected by the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act. I wish I were making this up, but I'm not. <p>

The disability laws are sacred cows, but they must at the very least be tethered so that they cannot be used to force universities to lower academic and other standards. <p>

My tour of follies in higher education has concentrated on sites that have benefited, so to speak, from Congress's helping hand. The Great Converge of student loan programs, the Death Valley of accreditation, the Old Growth Forest of mandatory retirement, and the High Plateau, home to Learning Disabled University, could not have become what they are without the wise counsel of Congresses past. <p>

I am conscious that in this speech I have been finding a great deal of fault with existing  arrangements. Burke, whom I referred to before, also observed that "those who are habitually employed in finding and displaying faults are unqualified for the work of reformation.... By hating vices too much, they come to love men too little."  In fact, I do not think I am    habitually employed in finding fault; this is a rather special occasion. <p>

Also, by concentrating on the evils brought on higher education by the government, I do not mean to suggest that only government can solve the problems it has created. Boston University, for example, has a number of initiatives which show how universities can help get government off the back of higher education. <p>

We have sought to lessen our dependence on federal research funding through Boston University's Community Technology Foundation, a venture capital fund established to develop the commercial potential of the work of our own researchers. We have invested about $60 million in Seragen, Inc., a start-up biotechnology company based on a breakthrough by a researcher in our Medical School. Seragen is currently in Stage III Clinical   Trials for a promising treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. <p>

Disregarding Conrad's advice yet again, I must also note that Boston University has received several large federal grants -- earmarked funds, if you will -- which paid part of the costs of very expensive science and engineering facilities on our campus. The Heritage Foundation is a place where one does not expect such a statement to be met with resounding applause, but I mention it for good reason. Our nation's universities are one of its major sources of commercially developable ideas and patents. The nation as a whole stands to gain a great deal economically and in other ways by treating some universities, in some respects, like venture capital firms. The public should invest in those who have the energy, the  know-how, and the overall promise to deliver -- and then wait and see. Government micromanagement of research grants is wasteful. Perhaps paradoxically, and certainly contrary to the assumptions of many, pork barrel projects often give the public its best return. <p>

That's my apostasy for the day. Boston University has taken some other steps that I am more confident you will agree are in the right direction. We have shown it isn't necessary to take a laissez-faire attitude toward drugs, toward uncivilized behavior in the dorms, and     toward bully-boy political behavior on the streets in order to attract students. <p>

We have shown that it is still possible to have a university that isn't kidding when it says that its principal mission is the pursuit of truth. <p>

I observed at the outset that leaving a child at college for the first time leaves a parent with some anxiety. I rather facetiously compared that to the anxiety a university administrator feels entrusting to the DOE the mounds of make-work the federal government now demands of us. There is, however, a more serious side to this anxiety. Most children learn to live responsibly with the freedom of campus life as a prelude to the responsibilities of full adulthood. With some trepidation, parents grant their children the independence to live up to the challenges. <p>

We'd like a government that has at least that much faith in its citizens. American higher education is one of this country's most outstanding accomplishments. A federal government that is prudently supportive is all we need. Most things we can do better on our own. <p>

<B><FONT SIZE=5>Crime:</B></FONT><P>
Aside from a handful of federal responsibilities, most criminal justice issues are a local matter and the Congress in Washington should let state and local governments deal with them.  If the Congress wants to do more about crime, it should lift the federal tax burden on the states and let them raise money for law enforcement and prisons.  I'm in favor of truth-in-sentencing, but I think John Engler, Tommy Thompson, Bill Weld, and the other governors can run their own prison systems.  If Members of Congress want to set the length of state prison sentences, they ought to resign and run for state legislator.
<HR WIDTH=30%>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Drug Legalization:</B></FONT><P>
The last thing we should do is make drugs legal.  That would only make them more available, dramatically increase the number of babies born having been exposed to drugs when their mothers were pregnant, increase the number of children and coworkers who use drugs, and make it almost impossible for addicts to quit.  We made great strides in the late 1980s in reducing drug use and we should keep at it.
<HR WIDTH=30%>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Education:  America 2000 v. Goals 2000:</B></FONT><P>
We need to send education back to states, communities and families -- where it belongs.  That was the idea behind America 2000.  The Clinton Administration's Goals 2000 goes in exactly the opposite direction.  They've turned a national movement into a federal program.<P> 
	* America 2000 was all about encouraging high standards in the core academic subjects.  Goals 2000 is about how much is spent on education.<P> 
	* America 2000 was about making schools more accountable for their performance.  Goals 2000 makes it harder to know how well schools are doing.<P>
	* America 2000 sought to give all families more choices of all schools.  Goals 2000 creates more obstacles for choice.<P>
<HR WIDTH=30%> 
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Education:  The Federal Role:</B></FONT><P>
Abolish the Department of Education in order to liberate parents and schools.  On January 26, I testified before the U.S. Congress and argued that it should take each activity currently housed in the Department of Education and do one of three things with it: (a) send it home to states and communities; (b) entrust it to another federal agency; or (c) terminate it and return the money to the taxpayers.  I've been looking at this issue for more than 15 years and I am convinced that the people in a position to know what is best for education are those closest to the child.  Education policy should be geared toward giving parents and teachers more control over what goes on in the classroom.
<HR WIDTH=30%>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Gun Control:</B></FONT><P>
I have never thought gun control equalled crime control.  If we are really interested in controlling crimes involving guns, we should have stricter penalties against those who commit the crimes.
<HR WIDTH=30%>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Health Care Reform:</B></FONT><P>
Our health care system is still in need of repair.  When President Clinton tried to fix it last year, he went in exactly the wrong direction:  a "one size fits all" plan, run by Washington, D.C., full of new rules, mandates, and penalties.  We shouldn't repeat his mistakes.  We need to involve all 50 governors to help advance some important reforms state-by-state.  A few basic insurance reforms would make health insurance more flexible and easier to keep when we change jobs or move.  We should also amend the tax code so that individuals who buy health insurance get the same break that companies and their employees now receive.  It is also time we started looking at medical IRAs, the most direct way of giving individuals control over their own health care costs.
<HR WIDTH=30%>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>History Curriculum Standards Sponsored by the Administration:</B></FONT><P>
They are not standards Lynne Cheney and I had in mind when we encouraged school boards to adopt voluntary educational standards. The history panel ended up presenting a warped view of our nation's past.  President Clinton should condemn these standards and make sure they are not promulgated or endorsed by the federal government.
<HR WIDTH=30%>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Medicaid:</B></FONT><P>
We would save money -- and deliver better medical care to the poor -- if we capped the growth of spending but gave governors the power to run Medicaid as they see fit.
<BR>
<BR>
The best way to reform Medicaid is the welfare "swap."  President Reagan tried a version of this in the early 1980s. The first step is to give the states complete responsibility  for welfare in exchange for the federal government picking up a comparable portion of state Medicaid expenditures.  The second step is to delegate responsibility for administering the program back to the states without the mandates from Washington.
<HR WIDTH=30%>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>School Prayer:</B></FONT><P>
I signed a bill permitting a moment of silence in schools in 1981 and I would sign one again today.  We should remember that on the first day of the very first session of Congress, the House and the Senate adopted the Bill of Rights.  On the second day, they adopted a national day of prayer called "Thanksgiving."
<HR WIDTH=30%>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=5>Welfare:</B></FONT><P>
Instead of fixing welfare in Washington for the sixth time, we should end welfare reform in Washington. Let's end welfare as a federal program and send responsibility for it back to the states, communities, and private agencies.  States are way ahead of Washington on this one.  Michigan requires all welfare recipients to get a job, go to school, or do volunteer community service.  Wisconsin says two years and you're out.  Massachusetts says 60 days.  California docks welfare checks when kids don't go to school.  New Jersey doesn't pay more to mothers on welfare who have more children.  I would add:  no marriage penalty, no added benefits for children born to unmarried mothers on welfare, a certain end to payments to able-bodied adults after a set time, jail time for deadbeat dads, no payment to anyone who commits a crime while on welfare, reduction of welfare for parents whose children quit school, privatize job finding programs.

<b>David Sacks and Peter Thiel</b><br>
<b>Policy Review</b><br>
<i>Fall 1995, Number74</i></center><p>
	Recent revelations in <i>U.S. News and World Report</i>'s annual college guide that the cost of a top undergraduate degree now exceeds $100,000 may represent a watershed. At more than $25,000 a year, many students and their families will have to think hard about whether an Ivy-League education is worth the expense. For some parents, the answer will be to send their capable child to a less prestigious university or college for about $50,000 less. Most parents, however, will decide to scrimp, save, and sacrifice -- and perhaps take out a second mortgage on their home -- rather than turn down that rare admission offer from a Harvard, Yale, Brown, or Duke.<p>	By no means unrepresentative of what is meant by a "prestige" school is Stanford University, consistently ranked in the top five in <i>U.S. News</i>'s survey and privileged by an ideal climate, sumptuous facilities, and a $2-billion endowment. The yearly competition for admission reflects this status: More than 15,000 applicants vie for 1,600 places in the freshman class. A year there does not come cheaply: $25,749 for tuition, room, and board -- about the cost of a new BMW 325i.<p>	For almost every year in the last two decades, Stanford's tuition increases have outpaced inflation and, more importantly, the rate of personal income growth in the United States. The increases primarily fund what Gerhard Casper, Stanford's president, has called a "mini-welfare state" -- an ever-expanding range of student services and new programs centered around the university's multicultural "experiment." In the 1980s, then-president Donald Kennedy declared that Stanford's multicultural venture was "a bold experiment that must succeed," and the university began spending with a vengeance to make sure it did.<p>	To administer its great experiment, Stanford employs nearly 7,000 staffmore than one bureaucrat for every undergraduate -- including a $50,000-a-year "Multicultural Educator." (By contrast, there are only 1,400 faculty members.) And there is a large assortment of new m
ulticultural departments (feminist studies, African-American studies, Chicano studies, Asian-American studies, Native-American studies), ethnic centers, "residential education" (which receives more than $3 million a year), and new classes and conferences. In 1991, the university established an Office for Multicultural Development as a cabinet-level department and invested it with sweeping powers to ensure the university's "transformation."<p>	You can't achieve transformation on the cheap. Stanford raised tuition by 5 percent this year, 7.5 percent a year ago, and a whopping 9.5 percent for the 1992-93 school year. A record two-thirds of undergraduates (and an even higher percentage of graduate students) now receive some form of financial aid. However generous this aid, the squeeze invariably falls on parents or the students themselves. And much of it is unnecessary: Last year, the <i>Stanford Review</i> examined the 1993-94 university budget for ways to cut costs and reduce tuition. The <i>Review</i> identified $10 million in savings by merging scaled-back gender- and race-studies departments with other programs. The paper saved an additional $1 million by eliminating "multicultural dorm programming." All told, the Review produced a plan to reduce Stanford's tuition by about 14 percent by trimming multicultural programs.<p>It would be welcome. Explains Patrick Callahan, executive director of the California Higher Education Policy Center, "There is close to a middle-class panic in this country from increases in tuition by private and public institutions."<p>Such fear is hardly overblown. In the trendy world of academia, which covets the latest politically correct program like a shiny new hood ornament, there is competition to keep up with the Stanfords. Yet Stanford's tuition ranks only 41st of 106 private colleges and universities surveyed by Cambridge Associates. <p>Many parents may be shocked to learn that the extra expense has not increased the quality of a undergraduate degree at Stanford, but rather ha
s undermined it. Students can still receive first-rate training in engineering, the sciences, and economics, where results are more testable. But many humanities and social science students will find themselves awash in courses that trivialize logical thinking and seem incapable of taking history, ideas, or truth seriously.<p>The curriculum boasts of literature courses that filter Shakespeare through the lens of lesbianism, American history courses that find no time to teach about the Constitution, English classes that require students to write grant proposals for environmental groups, and psychology courses that give high marks for finding "gender discrepancies" in pizza parlors. In short, much of the undergraduate humanities curricula has been transformed into a vehicle for shameless politicization and indoctrination. Parents of these youngsters may begin to wonder why they didn't just keep the money and open up their very own McDonald's franchise.<p><b>The New Classics</b><p>With the now-notorious chant "hey hey, ho ho, Western Culture's got to go," Stanford's activists demanded in 1987 that the core reading list be dumped in order to make room for a new curriculum. Ever since the university capitulated to these demands, the humanities have been undergoing a quiet revolution. As a start, consider the multiple-track "Cultures, Ideas, and Values" (CIV) program, the relativist 15-unit requirement (about $8,000 per student) that replaced the Western Culture core:<p><ul>
<li>Required reading in the Philosophy CIV track includes works by Chief Seattlethe 19th-century Indian leader whose alleged writings were later judged to be just of a pale face. Although the instructors have retained Plato and Aristotle, they primarily use them to contrast the "logocentrism" of Western philosophers with the more holistic approach of Australian Aborigines (whose unwritten "philosophy" is explained by Western anthropologists). One of the class's feminist instructors, Carol Delaney, teaches that the American role in World War II is "phallocentric" because men invented the atomic bomb without women. She compares the Manhattan Project to Frankenstein, both evil attempts to thwart women's role in the reproductive process.<p><li>The Bible is still read in all the CIV tracks, but many classes teach that Genesis is rife with sexism, and some sections even make the Apostle Paul politically correct by saying he may have been homosexual. Shakespeare is also still studied in all the tracks, but <i>The Tempest</i> is now viewed from a "slave perspective" and is made to serve as a case study in Western imperialism.</ul><p>
	Although CIV is perhaps the single biggest waste of student tuition, it represents just the tip of the scandal. Multiculturalism has overrun most of the major humanities and social-sciences departments. The cumulative effect has been a kind of institutionalized silliness. Consider just some of the more blatant examples:<ul>
<p><li>"Black Hair as Culture and History," one of the new multicultural history seminars, addressed how black hair "has interacted with the black presence in this country, and how it has played a role in the evolution of black society." Lectures included "The Rise of the Afro" and "Fade-O-Rama, Braiding and Dreadlocks," and local hair stylists were brought in for a week of discussions. Enrolled students viewed the 1960s musical <i>Hair</i> and read the lyrics to Michael Jackson's hit single "Man in the Mirror." "I couldn't have taught this class 10 years ago," Kennell Jackson explains. "But people don't look at me like I'm crazy anymore. What history does has broadened considerably."<p>
<li>History 267, "The History of Rights in the United States," was so busy extolling 1960s protest ("rights") movements that the class never even studied the Declaration of Independence or the Constitution.<p>
<li>"19th-Century American History," taught by Estelle Freedman, devoted half of class time to a study of women, because they had constituted half the U.S. population during that time. As a result of these priorities, the class did not have enough time to learn about the War of 1812. <p><li>"Religions in America," a religious-studies class that can satisfy three different graduation requirements, devoted whole lectures to Shamanism, the peyote cult, and the Kodiak sect, but not one to the Catholic Church. When discussed at all, Christianity was viewed from a feminist or gay "perspective" through such works as <i>Jesus Acted Up: A Gay and Lesbian Manifesto</i>, <i>A Second Coming Out</i>, and <i>Beyond the Father: Towards a Philosophy of Women's Liberation</i>.<p>
<li>Anthropology 1 (which can also fulfill three different graduation requirements) devoted lectures to "language imperialism" and criticized CNN for the phenomenon because the network broadcasts in English to non-English-speaking countries.<p><li>In Psychology 167D, students received academic credit for becoming "contraceptive peer counselors" and for demonstrating these skills by placing condoms on a plastic penis at dorm meetings. <p>
<li>In Stanford's mandatory freshman English classes, students are required to write grant proposals for their professors' favorite community-service agencies, including homeless advocacy projects, AIDS support groups, and environmental action leagues. Instead of focusing on reading and writing skills, these classes revolve around the "Community Service Writing Project," which assigns freshmen to such activities as answering telephones at Stanford's Center for Public Service and visiting East Palo Alto elementary schools. <p><li>Enrolling more than 100 students each quarter, Linguistics 73 is one of the most heavily subscribed courses fulfilling Stanford's new race-studies requirement. Entitled "African-American Vernacular English," the premise of the class is that inner-city slang (of the type heard in rap songs) is a legitimate dialect of the English language deserving scholarly attention.<p>
<li>"Interdisciplinary" courses provide the opportunity for politicization along several vectors. One example is "Peace Studies," taught by faculty from the departments of sociology, political science, psychology, history, and education. The class begins by defining "peace" as "collaborative well-being," a euphemism for a smorgasbord of the lecturers' pet policy choices -- nationalized health care, government-guaranteed employment, transfer payments to inner cities, radical feminism, and so forth -- all taught under the rubric of "peace." Meanwhile, the curriculum completely omitted the study of the origins of World War I, World War II, the War for Independence, or any other significant historical conflagrations. The Vietnam War and Gulf War were reviewed briefly, but only as they related to the "peace movement" and its (often unpacific) protests. The class's final lecture was entitled "Peace and You," in which the course's lecturers fondly recounted their own 1960s activism and exhorted students to join the "peace movement" and "to act responsibly and effectively on behalf of peace."<p><li>Comparative Literature 189, "Representing Sappho: the Literature of Lesbianism," sought, in the words of Terry Castle, "to resexualize lesbian history." Shakespeare's <i>As You Like It</i> was identified as a "<i>locus classicus</i> of lesbianism," and the remainder of the course readings -- books both new and old -- were probed for "male and female representations of lesbian desire" and for "lesbianism as 'symbolist,' 'decadent,' 'modernist,' and 'utopian' literary motif."</ul><p>Other courses addressing human sexuality:<p>
<ul>
<li>Feminist Studies 295, "How Tasty Were My French Sisters"; Comparative Literature 110, "The Politics of Desire: Representations of Gay and Lesbian Sexuality"; and Law 587, "The History and Politics of Sexual Orientation: Cross-Disciplinary Perspectives."<p>
<li>"Representing Sexualities: Whitman to AIDS" (English 187D) is another of Stanford's X-rated English classes. The course syllabus warns that "sexually explicit materials, both hetero- and homoerotic, may be viewed and discussed in this class." Readings included articles entitled "A Posttranssexual Manifesto," "Capitalism and Gay Identity," "From Thoreau to Queer Politics," and "How to Bring Your Kids up Gay," in addition to two videos, "Voices from the Front," by the militant homosexual group ACT-UP, and "Tongues Untied," a pornographic gay film. Jay Grossman spent his first class session presenting an episode of the television comedy <i>Cheers</i> and then deconstructing the show as "homophobic." His first reading assignment was several weeks of a cartoon strip in which a teenage character reveals that he is gay. In Stanford's English department, if the material is trendy enough, it does not even have to be literature.<p>
<li>Psychology 116, "The Psychology of Gender," is based on the premise that gender discrimination is everywhere, and so, not surprisingly, the class tends to find it everywhere. In her Spring 1994 class, Laura Carstenson required students to complete a group research project. Her favorite project was entitled "Gender Discrepancies in Pizza Consumption." The student authors first conducted their laborious research by "observing couples eating at a local pizza restaurant and recording the number of slices each individual consumed," and concluded that "gender discrepancies exist not only in quantity, but also in rate of consumption." Because this class meets the new feminist-studies requirement, it is heavily enrolled each quarter; hundreds of students are enlisted in this kind of inane multicultural research. </ul><p>
Such anecdotes do not simply exist on the fringes of an otherwise terrific Stanford education. Many involve core classes that fulfill graduation requirements, subjects at the heart of a liberal-arts education. All students must take CIV and Freshman English. In addition, the university has imposed a number of "distribution requirements" (DRs) which can only be fulfilled by classes in certain areas. While there is no requirement in American History, for instance, all students -- including science majors -- are now required to take at least one course in feminist studies, one course on race theory, and one course on Third World cultures. There are three additional social-studies requirements, usually satisfied by classes from such departments as anthropology, English, and sociology where the multicultural revolution has been pushed furthest. "Psychology of Gender," "African-American Vernacular English," Anthropology 1, and "Religions in America" are all classes that fulfill Drs.<p>
	The DR system limits the flexibility of conscientious students who wish to avoid swallowing large quantities of academic junk food. Of the 180 units necessary for graduation, distribution requirements in new or revamped subjects like CIV, Freshman English, race studies, feminist studies, and multicultural social studies now constitute almost 60 units. As a result, even those students who pursue majors in economics, physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, or engineering will spend close to one-third of their four years at Stanford -- at a cost of about $25,000 per year -- studying thoroughly politicized multicultural requirements.<P>Just in case these requirements do not suffice, however, Stanford's multiculturalists provide powerful incentives to take their electives. The average grade in Stanford's humanities departments is above an A-. Many of the most radical multiculturalists are also radical egalitarians who give everyone As, so from a student's point of view their classes are not necessarily the ones to avoid. What student wouldn't be attracted to a class like Peace Studies, where a "take-home" midterm and an "open-book" final exam guarantee an easy A? Science majors are particularly prone to building "trophy transcripts" by taking multicultural courses whenever possible, because they face the stiffest competition in admission to graduate programs and medical schools. <p>For those students pursuing a degree in the humanities or social sciences, there are even fewer options. The numerous examples already mentioned -- all fairly indicative -- represent just the beginning of an indoctrination into New Age thinking. For these hapless students, being principled or conscientious about course selection simply does not make much difference: Instead of "Black Hair" or Feminist Studies 101, such a student might find himself in "19th-Century American History" or "History of Rights," where the course title falsely advertises the subject matter. While there are, of course, still many solid courses (and good teac
hers) at Stanford, especially in engineering and the hard sciences, Stanford's activists have largely succeeded in killing the core undergraduate humanities curriculum. <p><b>The Multicultural Waste Land</b><p>The death of the humanities at Stanford does not imply that institutions like it will serve no function whatsoever. In the hard sciences, economics, and engineering, our top colleges and universities will graduate people who have amassed an impressive array of scientific knowledge and technical skills. At the same time, business, law, and medical schools will continue to churn out trained professionals. From the outside perspective of companies seeking to hire new computer engineers, biochemists, or investment bankers, everything will continue as before.	<p>	But in the process, Stanford risks becoming a technical school, along the lines of MIT or Caltech -- highly esteemed in narrow areas of expertise and not much more. Behind the facade of normalcy, much may be lost. The university may be transformed into a multiversity, no longer capable of providing a universal framework for students to integrate a wide assortment of knowledge into a coherent whole. That kind of framework, so essential for thinking about the larger problems facing individuals and societies, simply cannot be provided by science; it must be gleaned from the humanities, and can be reached only after rigorous study -- in philosophy, literature, and history. <p>	Most students have only the vaguest notion of what some of the alternatives might be -- what Socrates, Jesus, or Jefferson said that might be relevant to the contemporary situation. They have only a minimal understanding even of the ideas that built the American regime. Most have not read John Locke or Adam Smith, much less <i>The Federalist Papers</i>, Alexis de Tocqueville, or Abraham Lincoln. Though the loss of this framework cannot readily be translated into dollars and cents, it will be felt keenly nonetheless, by a generation of students increasingly alienated from an inc
oherent and senseless world, unable even to diagnose the source of their troubles.<p>The scope of this loss has been hinted at, indirectly, by one of Casper's most sweeping proposals. He has suggested replacing the four-year undergraduate degree with a three-year degree. His proposal is particularly heretical, because it suggests that students are not getting much added value out of a fourth year at Stanford and that the university's distribution requirements might need to be scrapped. "If resources were available, I'd say four years are wonderful, the more the better," he says. "On a cost-benefit analysis, there will be more questions as to whether these four years are sustainable in the long run." <p>In a narrow sense, Casper was clearly right: If there was no real humanities program left, then a three-year professional education would represent a sensible change. At the same time, however, the call for such a drastic remedy indicated how much had been lost and how little else could be done about this loss.<p>If higher education in America is not altogether finished, then perhaps it is in the midst of a massive and unprecedented displacement. An intellectual renaissance in our traditional centers of higher learning may be a long time coming, but this does not necessarily imply that people simply will stop thinking in the intervening years. To the extent that it continues, intellectual life will likely shift from elite universities to historically less significant colleges that have survived the multicultural transformation, or move altogether outside the academic context.<p>New educational venues may arise and meet demands no longer being satisfied by existing institutions. One promising area involves new computer networks in which people connect with one another from all parts of the country to discuss matters of common interest. Not surprisingly, a number of these networks focus on areas that no longer have much of a place in the multicultural academy, such as free-market economics or Thomistic theology
. Because learning need not take place in the classroom, this sort of technological breakthrough may in time undermine the near-monopoly on higher education currently enjoyed by America's elite universities.<p>Admittedly, that distant prospect offers small solace to students who are eager to attend prestigious schools like Stanford, but are hard pressed to find there academic mentors to guide them toward answers to ancient and modern questions: What constitutes justice, rather than political propaganda about the size of welfare payments; what the Bible teaches about man's political nature, rather than radical speculation about the Apostle Paul's sexual orientation; or the Founders' view of slavery and race relations, instead of courses on hairstyles. At $100,000 for a degree, is that really asking too much?

 CLINTONITES MISS THE MOON</H2>

<P>
When Americans look back on the twentieth century, they may well
view the landing on the moon as <I>the</I> most significant event
of our time.  So said historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. 
<P>
Not if they are taught U.S. history according to the National
History Standards.  That's because, incredibly, the team that
labored for two years and spent $2 million in federal grants to
come up with &quot;world class&quot; standards completely missed
the moon.  They include references to &quot;Soviet advances in
space&quot; and to the <I>Challenger</I> disaster, but neglect
to mention that the United States won the space race.
<P>
Hardly an American has been unaffected by the U.S. landing on
the moon.  Thousands of us are alive today because of advances
in medical technology that are a &quot;spinoff&quot; of the space
program.  The computer revolution and the development of worldwide
communications networks are a direct result of the massive U.S.
drive to reach the moon.  Schlesinger is clearly right to signal
its importance.  And it is ironic that the national history standards,
rightly assailed by conservatives as &quot;politically correct,&quot;
should have effaced the memory of Jack Kennedy's most enduring
accomplishment.
<P>
It is hard to overstate the magnitude of the failure.  For the
Department of Education, this embarrassing public fiasco is indisputable
evidence of bureaucratic ineptitude.  If we adopt these amnesiac
history standards, we will succumb to a kind of national identity
crisis.  We will cease to remember who we are and why it matters
that there is an America.
<P>
This gaffe is almost unbelievable.  I say <I>almost</I> because
as Undersecretary in the U.S. Department of Education under President
Reagan, I gained an appreciation for how bureaucracies work. 
And I learned why we can never have national standards in education
determined by political bodies.  However well intended, the Goals
2000 legislation, which drives national standards, is deeply flawed.
 The attempt to have government determine &quot;official knowledge&quot;
in this country cannot help but become a political football. 
What George Will has called a &quot;cranky anti-Americanism&quot;
has come to dominate too many professional historians' worldview.
 That's why their depiction of America's &quot;war of vengeance&quot;
against Japan forced the Smithsonian's <I>Enola Gay</I> exhibit
to be cancelled. 

<P>
The Clinton administration's national history standards project
did not just miss the moon.  Major U.S. advances in medicine have
been lost as well, such as the development of anesthesia, the
conquest of Yellow Fever, and the discovery of the polio vaccine.
 Similarly, there is an anti-free enterprise bias to the history
standards.  Students are encouraged to put John D. Rockefeller
on trial for his sharp business tactics.  But where do the standards
lead young Americans to an understanding of the most productive
and free economic system in history?  Nowhere.
<P>
Defenders of the history standards complain that the criticisms
are all coming from conservatives, from the angry white male caucus.
 Well, the history standards' dismissal of Paul Revere and Robert
E. Lee, Thomas Edison and Albert Einstein would appear to fit
this category.  But how can these apologists explain the omission
of leading black Americans like Thurgood Marshall, Gen. Colin
Powell, Gen. Benjamin O. Davis, Ralph Bunche, Roy Wilkins and
the Rev. Ralph David Abernathy?  And how to explain the cultural
importance the history standards give to &quot;Madonna&quot; and
Roseanne, while pushing Leontyne Price and Marian Anderson off
the bus?  Further, how do historians who gave us six references
to the Seneca Falls Convention on women's rights explain their
failure to include Sen. Margaret Chase Smith and Ambassador Claire
Booth Luce?  These influential women were Republican leaders and
early advocates of the E.R.A. Was their adherence to the E.R.A.
<I>and </I>the GOP offensive to the panel?  Whatever became of
the big tent?  
<P>
It goes without saying that the history standards' emphasis on
race, gender, and class forces young Americans to accept a secular
world view.  But for millions of us, our religous ties are more
important than ethnicity, gender and geography.  The history standards
panel clearly failed to comprehend the influence of religion in
American life.  How else to explain the fact that they consistently
employ the term &quot;fundamentalists,&quot; a term generally
viewed as pejorative.  Some 30 million Evangelicals, recognized
even by <I>TIME </I>and <I>Newsweek</I>, receive no mention. 
Some groups seem more equal than others.  Catholic Americans will
find it odd that their children will learn of Mother Jones, but
never hear about Mother Seton.  Father Coughlin gets in, but Bishop
Fulton J. Sheen is an &quot;unperson.&quot;  Jewish Americans
will find a similar skittishness about recognizing the accomplishments
of Jews as Jews.  Interestingly, too, for a document that emphasizes
group experience and all claims of victimhood, the national history
standards are strangely silent about America's role in four Arab-Israeli
wars.  
<P>
Tocqueville recognized that centralization of administration was
always the enemy of excellence because it enervates local initiative.
 Not only will national standards in education, bureaucratically
derived and politically driven, fail to overcome a rising tide
of mediocrity, they will become a part of it.  As President Kennedy
often said: &quot;We can do better.&quot;

<title>EDUCATION DEBATE NEEDS TO FOCUS ON THE FAMILY</title>
<body>

<h2>EDUCATION DEBATE NEEDS TO<br>
FOCUS ON THE FAMILY</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>William R. Mattox, Jr.</i></center>
<p>
The U.S. Department of Education recently launched a series of
events to encourage greater family and community involvement in
learning.  While it is surely odd for an Administration that opposes
parental choice in education to lead such an effort, this public
relations blitz -- or at least the research that undergirds it
-- truly deserves wide attention.
<p>
Families exert far more influence over their children's intellectual
development than is commonly realized.  In fact, more than three
decades of research shows that families have greater influence
over a child's academic performance than any other factor -- including
schools.
<p>
In the mid-1960s, University of Chicago sociologist James Coleman
led a major research study which found a &quot;powerful relation
of the child's own family background characteristics to his achievement,
a relation stronger than that of any school factors.&quot;  Coleman's
research spawned a number of studies replicating his work and
building upon it.  These studies consistently confirmed Coleman's
chief finding that families exert considerable influence over
student achievement.
<p>
What is especially important about this body of research is that
it consistently shows that what families <I>do</I> really matters.
 That is, differences in student learning are not determined simply
by the quality of one's gene pool or by which side of the tracks
one lives on.  Instead, differences stem significantly from the
values, habits, and relational dynamics at work within the household.
<p>
Take, for example, family meals together.  While some might consider
this a rather trivial family ritual, several studies have found
the frequency of family meals together to be a strong predictor
of student test scores.  In explaining this high positive correlation,
 Chester Finn of the Hudson Institute says that consistent mealtimes
give parents regular opportunities to ask questions about what
kids are doing in school.  Mealtimes also give 
parents regular opportunities to broaden children's educational
horizons.  For example, Theodore Roosevelt's interest in public
affairs is said to have been cultivated by the rich dinnertime
discussions his family regularly enjoyed when he was a boy.
<p>
Just as family interactions around the dinner table pay surprising
dividends, the number and variety of learning tools (books, tapes,
puzzles, encyclopedias, computers, and the like) in the home have
a profound effect on children's learning, especially when these
materials are used in direct parent-child interaction.  For example,
a 1985 report from the National Academy of Education found that
the single most important activity for building the knowledge
required for eventual success in reading is reading aloud to children.
 Moreover, a 1992 study at the City University of New York found
that average IQ scores of low-income preschoolers are boosted
by nearly seven percentage points for each day of the week that
their mother reads to them.
<p>
The benefits of parent-child verbal interaction can also be seen
in recent research showing preschoolers placed in full-time day
care settings often lag behind their home-reared peers in language
development.  What is the primary reason for the difference? Young
children at home spend much of their day interacting verbally
with people (particularly Mom) whose language skills are more
advanced, whereas kids in day care spend most of their day interacting
verbally with peers whose language skills are no more developed
than their own.
<p>
Given the extraordinary influence families have over their children's
learning, it is curious that almost all public discussion about
improving education in this country centers around school-based
reforms of one kind or another.  While no one would deny many
school-based reforms are needed, Seattle public schoolteacher
David Guterson believes the promise of such reforms is often overblown.
 &quot;We should think clearly about the problems of schools and
ask ourselves why every attempt to correct them seems doomed to
fail,&quot; Guterson writes.  &quot;We should recognize that schools
will never solve the bedrock problems of education.&quot;  
<p>
Only families can.  Only families will.
<p>
Unless and until our education debate begins to focus on the family,
significantly improving student performance in America is likely
to remain an elusive goal.

<title>Time To Permit Oil Drilling In the Arctic Refuge</title>

<h3><i>TIME TO PERMIT OIL DRILLING IN THE ARCTIC REFUGE</i></h3>
By John Shanahan<br>
Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 432<br>
October 17, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>

	The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) in Alaska is the subject of heated debate as some Members of Congress, led by Senators Frank Murkowski (R-AK) and Ted Stevens (R-AK) and Representative Don Young (R-AK), attempt to open a small fraction of the area to oil exploration and production. A provision included in the budget reconciliation would open the Coastal Plain area of ANWR. This effort is a sensible approach that could dramatically expand much-needed domestic oil production with negligible impact on the environment.
<p>
	ANWR is an enormous area of land located in the Northeast corner of Alaska within the Arctic Circle. Contrary to the image evoked by opponents of oil production, that ANWR is the last small pristine area left in Alaska, the state has an abundance of hardy ecosystems. In addition to the healthy ecosystems existing on millions of acres of private and state land, the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANILCA) of 1980 set aside 100 million acres of land as parks, refuges, and preserves, including 57 million acres of wilderness. ANWR itself covers 19.8 million acres. While eight million acres of ANWR were set aside as wilderness, 1.5 million acres were designated for review by the Department of Interior (DOI) to recommend future management of high potential oil resources. In 1987, DOI recommended that this 1.5 million acres, known as the Coastal Plain, be leased for oil and gas exploration and production in an environmentally sensitive manner.
<p>
	The provision in the budget reconciliation bill would implement DOI's recommendation. But only a tiny fraction -- far less than one percent -- of the Coastal Plain area would be affected. Advancing technology over the last 20 years has reduced the necessary size or "footprint" of drilling operations to less than one-fifth of what was required, say, at Prudhoe Bay. So exploration and production would affect only about 2,000 acres. To put this in perspective, that is an area about one-sixth the size of Dulles Airport near Washington, D.C., and about 0.01 percent of the total area of ANWR. Even in this very limited area, modern sophisticated operations adopt many environmentally sensitive methods which further limit any ecological impact.
<p>
	Expanded oil production is badly needed. The United States currently imports more than half its oil consumption, and reliance on foreign oil is growing. That raises national security concerns and is an unwelcome factor in foreign policy considerations. This reliance caused a $51 billion oil trade deficit last year -- roughly equivalent to the U.S. trade deficit with Japan. Foreign energy dependence would be eased considerably if the Coastal Plain produced oil. The area potentially could produce 1.5 million barrels of oil per day for at least a quarter of a century, thereby increasing domestic production by almost 25 percent. Allowing limited drilling in ANWR also would reduce the trade deficit by about $14 billion per year. Further, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that federal revenues from lease sales would be $1.3 billion over the next seven years, helping to trim the budget deficit.
<p>
	Alaska's residents would be big beneficiaries of lease sales. Alaska has agreed to split the estimated $2.6 billion revenue from lease sales evenly with the federal government (rather than take the 90 percent to which the state otherwise would be entitled), so the state still will receive $1.3 billion. This partially explains why three-quarters of Alaskans support the plan.
<p>
	Not only will Alaskans and the federal treasury benefit from increased oil production, but an estimated 222,000-732,000 jobs will be created throughout the country. There will be new hires in the oil industry and manufacturers, suppliers, and transporters of oil-related equipment will increase hiring dramatically, with fully 98 percent of these jobs in the lower 48 states. Based on a mid-range estimate of job creation, this one action would drop the unemployment rate by 0.36 percentage points.1
<p>
	The only potentially legitimate objection to opening the Coastal Plain of ANWR to oil drilling would be on environmental grounds. But these concerns are without merit because of the very limited impact of modern drilling and production techniques. Even the "pro-environment" native Inupiat Eskimos, who live in or near the Coastal Plain and opposed oil drilling in Prudhoe Bay 60 miles away, support onshore oil development in the area. As Inupiat Mayor George Ahmagak of the North Slope Borough wrote last June, "Our whalers and hunters make maximum use of our few resources, always taking care not to harm the land so their grandchildren may in turn carry on their culture.... As Mayor, I can state unequivocally that the people of the North Slope Borough enthusiastically support the presence of the oil industry in our land.... The wisdom of our Elders teaches us the value of hunting where game is most plentiful. Likewise, it makes sense for our nation to seek oil in an area that even [DOI] has identified as the country's best prospect for new petroleum deposits."2
<p>
	Exploration is opposed by the Gwich'in Indians, who live 120 miles south and have strong ties to the environmental lobby. They are concerned about protecting their hunt of 300-350 animals from the 152,000 porcupine caribou. While the herd size has fallen from its high of 180,000 a few years ago, oil drilling is unlikely to have any negative impact. One reason for this confidence is that the Central Arctic caribou herd living in the Prudhoe Bay area already has increased its population over sevenfold since oil production began 20 years ago, despite dire warnings at the time that the herd would decline sharply if oil drilling was permitted. In fact, the second-largest oil field in the U.S. is the favorite place for caribou to give birth. 
<p>
	 The facts are clear. Permitting oil production in ANWR would spur economic growth, cut the trade deficit, and ease national security concerns. Moreover, it poses virtually no threat to the environment. It is time for Congress to give the green light to limited exploration and production.

INTRODUCTION

<P>   After eighteen high-level hearings, and a review of 29,000 pages
of written material and hundreds of proposals, the Energy Department
earlier this year released its National Energy Strategy. Known as the
NES, this is a wide-ranging list of particular recommendations for
every type of energy and just about every energy issue.
<P>   The report comes at a time of much confusion about America's
energy situation and the policies that will best guarantee America's
energy security. For example, figures recently released by the Energy
Department show the country's oil imports dropping by around 1 million
barrels per day or 12 percent of the country's total use. While some
observers might thus assume that there is no energy problem, in the
long term America's energy needs will increase. More energy will have
to be produced domestically or imported from overseas. In addition,
Congress is considering a higher gas tax. Such a tax would increase
costs for consumers and businesses, reducing American competitiveness
and lowering American living standards. At the levels of taxes being
discussed, perhaps ten cents per gallon, oil consumption would not be
significantly reduced. A tax of, say, 50 cents per gallon would reduce
consumption dramatically -- by bringing the American economy to a
halt. This is hardly a result acceptable to most policy makers.

<P> Sound Recommendations. On the whole, the report is well balanced
and its recommendations sound. Its major dual message is the need to
reduce or eliminate government regulations that discourage energy
production and the need to free entrepreneurs to meet America's energy
needs. 

<P> As important as what the NES does, however, is what the NES does
not do. In particular, it avoids many of the disastrous errors of the
1970s, when the federal government believed that it could control
America's energy supply and demand. The results of this are well
known: soaring energy prices, block-long gas lines, and uncertainty
about America's energy and economic future. To be sure, there are
shortcomings. The NES does tend to call for government research in
energy areas that might best be left to the private sector. And in
some cases the report could be more emphatic about the need for market
reforms. But if policy makers do follow the NES roadmap, in general
they will be taking America down the path to energy security.

<P> Among NES topics and recommendations:

<P> Energy Production and Efficiency. To promote both production and
efficiency, the NES suggests more deregulation of local electrical
monopolies, strict market pricing for electricity, and federal
government purchases of natural gas vehicles.

<P> Domestic Oil. To increase the domestic oil supply, the NES
recommends opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the Outer
Continental Shelf to oil exploration.

<P> Western Hemisphere Energy Security. To reduce America's reliance
on oil from the politically unstable Middle East without raising costs
to consumers, the NES emphasizes negotiating freer energy trade and
investment in the Western Hemisphere.

<P> Natural Gas. To make maximum use of this clean energy source,
found in abundance in America, the NES suggests, among other things,
deregulating pipeline construction and pricing and removing
restrictions on imports and exports of natural gas.

<P> Domestic Coal. To make better use of this resource, also found
in abundance in America, the NES recommends a consistent and
predictable, rather than arbitrary, application of environmental laws,
using coal slurry pipelines and preventing the Environmental
Protection Agency from mandating specific technology and production
methods for coal plants.

<P> Nuclear Energy. The NES points out that this is a safe, non-
polluting energy source, and suggests research to develop better
designs for nuclear plants, to reform licensing procedures, and to
increase the potential sites for nuclear waste disposal.

<P> Renewable Energy and Electricity. The NES recommends removing
licensing restrictions on hydroelectric plants and continuing research
into nuclear fusion.
<P> A major NES failing is the scant attention that it gives some
key issues. For one thing, tax policy needs an overhaul. While the NES
suggests modest changes in the tax code, what is needed is a
restoration of all those tax code pressures dealing with the energy
industry that Congress has eliminated since 1969.

<P> For another thing, the NES should be more emphatic about
developing a Western Hemisphere common market for energy to diversify
supplies and reduce dependence on the Middle East. 

<P> These deficiencies, however, are dwarfed by the achievement of
the NES in presenting, for the first time, a comprehensive review of
America's energy situation and in offering many market-oriented
proposals for America's future energy security. 

<P> The NES already is prompting action on Capitol Hill. On June 4
the Senate Energy Committee approved S.1220, the National Energy
Security Act, co-sponsored by Bennett Johnston, the Louisiana
Democrat, and Malcolm Wallop, the Wyoming Republican. Essentially
similar to the Bush Administration's NES, the bill faces an uncertain
fate. Many amendments could be added to it that would make America
less energy secure. The House of Representatives is working on its own
version of a comprehensive energy bill. 

<P> The Free Market Acts. When Saddam Hussein overran Kuwait about a
year ago, crude oil prices shot to record levels. Some lawmakers urged
a return to the interventionist energy policies of the 1970s. The Bush
Administration wisely resisted this. Although the Iraqi crisis reduced
world crude oil production by 4.1 million barrels per day, roughly the
same as the 1973 Arab oil boycott and 1979 Iranian oil embargo, thanks
to the Bush Administration's response, the results were entirely
different. In both 1973 and 1979, emergency government controls
greatly aggravated the effects of the disruption. In 1990, the
Administration allowed the market to operate freely. As a result, the
oil price rise was brief, peaking last October. By this February oil
prices fell to below prewar levels. There were no 1970s-style gas
lines.

<P> History demonstrates that the best government role in the energy
sector is to assure that markets operate without hindrance. Markets,
as even East European leaders now recognize, are the most efficient
means of allocating resources. Yet federal government restrictions
continue to impede the market's function in energy. Removing these
obstacles deserves a high priority if America is to achieve energy
security. 
<P>
AMERICA'S ENERGY SITUATION

<P> The United States is a country rich in energy. Domestic coal,
natural gas, and oil are pillars of America's energy base. Still,
current patterns of production and consumption will have to change in
the future as known resources are exhausted. 

<P> Fossil fuels account for 89.2 percent of all energy used in the
U.S. Oil is America's most important energy source. Last year, oil
accounted for some 40 percent of American energy use. Next came
natural gas, accounting for 24 percent of consumption, followed by
coal at 23.3 percent. Nuclear energy contributed 7 percent of
America's needs, with the rest coming from hydroelectric dams, and
alternative energy sources. 

<P> Even these figures, though, understate the importance of oil.
Some 97 percent of all transportation energy comes from petroleum.
While alternative fuels have made modest inroads in the transportation
market, it will be a decade or more before they can offset oil
consumption significantly.

<P> This May, Americans used an average of 15,844,000 barrels per
day (b/d) of oil, roughly one million less than in 1990. During this
period, America's oil imports fell by 7.2 percent, from 8,649,000 b/d
to 8,027,000 b/d. Still, America relies on foreign oil for more than
half of its needs. More disturbing, America's oil production fell from
around nine million b/d in 1985 to roughly 7.3 million b/d in 1990, a
decline of almost 19 percent. 

<P> Though the Persian Gulf crisis spurred higher American oil
output, the boost was small and as it turns out, temporary. Of more
fundamental importance is the fact that America's "proved reserves" --
essentially the oil that America has on the shelf -- have declined by
over 27 percent since the 1973 Arab oil embargo.

<P> That America imports great quantities of oil is not, in itself,
a problem. The real concern is whether the level of imports leaves
America vulnerable to severe economic dislocation should foreign oil
supplies suddenly be disrupted. This was the case in the 1970s, when
two sudden and sharp price hikes rocked the American economy. When all
factors are taken into account, the combined effects of the 1973 Arab
oil embargo, and 1979 Iranian oil boycott cost America an astounding
$1.5 trillion between 1974 and 1984. 

<P> And the 1970s oil shocks occurred when U.S. oil imports were far
lower than they are today. America now imports over half its oil
compared with 34.8 percent in 1973. Some 27 percent of imports, or
11.8 percent of American consumption, comes from the Persian Gulf,
primarily from Saudi Arabia. The price hike that followed the invasion
of Kuwait cost American consumers nearly $39 billion in higher oil
prices. 

<P> To hedge against abrupt interruptions of oil supplies from
abroad, the U.S. government maintains 587.5 million barrels of crude
oil stored in its Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR). If all imports
from all sources were cut off, the SPR would last about 75 days at
current rates of consumption. Not much more oil could be obtained at
short notice from American sources. The Energy Department estimates
that even under the most favorable circumstances domestic oil
production in the past year could have been increased by only about
100,000 b/d -- and this would have taken about a year. 

<P> Thus security of supply is a fundamental consideration in
American energy policy. This is recognized by NES. Its recommendations
aim at a secure energy future achieved through market-based actions
that improve efficiency, enhance security of supply, assure a clean
environment, and fortify the foundations of America's energy economy. 
<P>
INCREASING ENERGY AND ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY

<P> The NES devotes 42 of its 189 pages to energy conservation,
attained by boosting energy efficiency. While it is true that the
document does not call for the sorts of mandates, regulations, and
subsidies that were in favor during the 1970s, the dismal failure of
those measures readily justifies their absence. Instead, the NES makes
concrete suggestions for energy efficiency improvements for
electricity generation, residential and commercial buildings use,
industrial use, and transportation.
<P>
** Electricity

<P> Most electricity is generated by utility companies, which are
local monopolies closely regulated by state and federal authorities.
This system stifles competition and is inefficient. The NES addresses
these shortcomings by seeking increased competition within the
electricity market. To do this, the NES proposes amending the 56-year-
old Public Utility Holding Company Act to permit utilities to build,
own, and operate power plants outside their traditional service area.
The NES also would eliminate size restrictions on so-called
Independent Power Producers (IPPs) -- firms that are not part of a
public utility, but that build and operate plants that sell
electricity to utilities. Current size restrictions prevent IPPs from
competing with traditional utilities for the construction of new
generating capacity. 

<P> The NES also supports efforts by the Federal Energy Regulatory
Commission (FERC) to allow IPPs to use existing electricity
transmission lines owned by local electric utility monopolies.
Currently, local monopolies need not permit IPPs access to such lines.
To expand operations, IPPs must have access to transmission
facilities.

<P> The NES also recommends eliminating subsidies to the federal
Power Marketing Authorities -- or PMAs. Established in 1906 to
distribute the electricity generated by federal water projects, the
PMAs sell power to their customers at prices below market cost; the
taxpayer absorbs the difference. To date, PMAs have cost the Treasury
$4 billion. As a result, PMA customers predictably waste "inexpensive"
electricity. Phasing out the huge subsidies to PMAs would encourage
conservation and promote general economic efficiency, ending the waste
of taxpayer dollars. 
<P>
** Commercial and Residential Energy Efficiency

<P> Residential use accounts for around 20 percent of American
energy consumption. Each year, 90 million American households spend
around $100 billion for heating, lighting, cooking, and other uses.
Commercial buildings account for about 15 percent of total energy
consumption, and about $70 billion in annual outlays.

<P> Residential use of energy dropped by about one-third between
1962 and 1986 because of efficiency improvements in appliances, and
investments by homeowners in energy-saving measures. Yet the use of
the various kinds of fuel consumed to generate power for homeowners
increased as they shifted away from oil and coal for space heating and
water heating. The fastest growing end users of primary energy,
meanwhile, are commercial buildings, as a result of the spread of air-
conditioning and the proliferation of computers, copiers, printers,
and other office equipment.

<P> A main obstacle identified by the NES to improving residential
and commercial energy efficiency are government regulations that
prevent energy prices from reflecting fully the real costs of
generating the energy. Another obstacle is that government-owned
housing is insulated from market forces and public housing authorities
feel no competitive need to increase energy efficiency. 

<P> NES recommendations for commercial and residential energy mainly
aim to spur research and development and education. The NES recognizes
that conservation must be market-driven. One flaw in the NES
recommendation, however, is the call for government efficiency
standards for residences and commercial buildings. Mandating
efficiency in buildings was attempted in the 1970s without success. 
<P>
** Industrial Energy Efficiency

<P> The industrial sector accounts for about one-quarter of American
energy consumption. Industrial energy conservation as a response to
market forces is one of the great success stories of the American
energy economy. Between 1973 and 1989, the value of goods and services
produced in America rose by 50 percent in real terms; the amount of
energy required to produce these actually fell by 6 percent. Private
industry reflexively responded to high energy prices by conserving
energy. 

<P> The NES's primary recommendation to improve industrial energy
efficiency is additional funding for research and development to help
firms find new ways to use waste as a fuel. Yet industries already
spend an estimated $46 billion annually for pollution control. Thus
industry already has a strong financial incentive to find ways to use
waste as a fuel. This is because the process of using waste products
to generate energy consumes many pollutants. NES also recommends
increased use of energy audits by industry. Such audits permit firms
to identify areas in which they can reduce energy consumption and thus
save money with existing technologies. The federal Department of
Energy's help in this is particularly important for small - and
medium-sized firms, which often lack the technical capability to
perform such audits themselves. 
<P>
** Transportation Energy Use

<P> The greatest opportunity for improving American energy
efficiency is in transportation. Last year Americans spent $200
billion on transportation fuels, accounting for two-thirds of
petroleum use and one-fourth of total energy consumption. Since 1976,
the amount of oil consumed by transportation has exceeded American
domestic production. Petroleum use for transportation is expected to
continue growing, rising to more than 42 percent of total energy use
by 2010, and to 66 percent by 2030.

<P> For transportation, the most important NES recommendation
encourages the use of alternative fuels. In principle this is sound.
Yet the NES shies away from evaluating specific alternative fuels. The
only exception is the NES recommendation to extend an already existing
tax credit to oil companies for using ethanol. Because of this tax
break, "gasohol," a blend of 10 percent ethanol/90 percent gasoline,
accounts for about 10 percent of the gasoline supply. This means that
ethanol is replacing about 1 percent of the gasoline, a very tiny
amount. The NES should have evaluated the merits of alternative fuels.
Had it done so, it probably would have concluded that natural gas is
the most promising alternative.
<P>
FLEET CONVERSION TO NATURAL GAS

<P> For America, natural gas is a good substitute for gasoline for
transportation. First, America has an abundance of natural gas. Were
it used in place of oil in all domestic fleet vehicles, current levels
of consumption could be maintained for more than a half-century.
Second, natural gas is clean burning and, as a gasoline substitute,
would reduce air pollution. 

<P> Natural gas would be best suited as a gasoline substitute in
fleet vehicles operated by a single owner such as a taxi company, a
delivery service, or a local government. Although comprising 6.5
percent of the total vehicle population, fleet vehicles consume
approximately 10 percent of all motor fuel. The $2,000 to $3,000 cost
for converting an engine to burn natural gas is currently a deterrent
to fleet use of this fuel. Were there greater demand, however,
vehicles could be equipped at the factory to use natural gas. This
would cut costs from 50 percent to 70 percent. Chrysler Corporation
and General Motors plan to establish experimental production lines for
alternative fueled cars and trucks. United Parcel Service and other
firms are converting part of their fleets. Local governments too may
want to buy natural gas vehicles to help meet air quality regulations.
Even at the current prices, the cost of converting fleets to natural
gas, the amount can be recovered in slightly over three years thanks
to lower fuel and operating costs. 

<P> Fueling Federal Fleets. The NES wisely calls for more public
education on the benefits of alternative fuel vehicles. Better still
is the NES suggestion that the federal government buy natural gas
vehicles for its fleets. The federal government owns more than 200,000
motor vehicles, and in fiscal 1990 alone purchased 49,188 civilian
vehicles. Federal purchases of natural gas vehicles would create
enough demand to justify the mass production lines that significantly
reduce costs. 

<P> This April 17, George Bush issued an Executive Order requiring
federal agencies to purchase as many alternative-fuel vehicles as
possible, and to compute cost/benefit ratios for the purchases on a
"lifecycle costing" basis. This means that the total cost of owning
and operating the vehicle over its useful life, rather than just its
purchase price, will be how a vehicle's cost is reckoned.

<P> Local governments, meanwhile, also could spur use of natural gas
by permitting gas utilities to supply natural gas for the vehicle fuel
market. Such sales would be part of what is termed a utility's "non-
core" business, which is not regulated because it is not part of a
utility's local monopoly. Allowing utilities to sell natural gas for
vehicles would introduce new competition and reduce fuel costs. 

<P> Increased demand for natural gas as a fuel for vehicles will cut
the prices of all aspects of this market. Example: It now costs from
$2,500 to $3,500 to buy a home compressor which can be attached to a
residential natural gas line to fuel a natural gas vehicle. If mass-
produced, the price could drop to under $1,000. A gas utility could
install such a unit and recover its cost over, say, five years through
fuel sales. As the number of natural gas vehicles increased, utilities
could also install natural gas compressors at gasoline filling
stations. Several already exist in the Washington, D.C., area. To do
this, however, utilities must be allowed to sell natural gas fuel as a
non-core business.
<P>
DOMESTIC OIL SECURITY

<P> The principal problems addressed by the NES are the potential
dangers to America's energy supplies. Oil is the most important
component of the U.S. energy mix, accounting for 42 percent of all
energy consumed and more than 97 percent of all transportation fuel.
Last year Americans consumed an average of 17 million b/d. U.S.
domestic production, however, has been falling, from just under 9
million b/d in 1985 to 7.3 million b/d in 1990. This is roughly 19
percent in domestic oil production. As a result, last year Americans
paid some $55 billion for net oil imports. This figure could rise to
$200 billion by 2010 according to Energy Department statistics. In the
first half of the year oil imports actually fell by one million b/d,
or about 12 percent of the total from the previous year. But this was
due to factors other than a change in America's long-term energy
production and consumption trends. First, due to uncertainty over the
situation in the Persian Gulf, American oil companies drew on their
own stored supplies and therefore required less imports. And second,
the recession dampened oil consumption, thereby reducing some of the
need for imported and domestically produced oil. The NES recommends
reducing U.S. vulnerability to oil "shocks" by encouraging increased
domestic oil production.
<P>
** The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge

<P> The NES recommends opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge
(ANWR) to oil exploration. Originally established in 1980 under
Section 1002 of the Alaskan National Interest Lands Conservation Act,
ANWR covers 19 million acres of Alaska's northernmost territory. About
8 percent of this area holds high promise for petroleum exploration.
According to the Energy Department, it may contain more oil than
Alaska's Prudhoe Bay, the largest North American oil field discovered
to date. 

<P> Opponents of exploration in ANWR claim that development would
harm wildlife. Yet more than a decade of experience at Prudhoe Bay,
which steadily produces an average of 1.8 million b/d of oil,
demonstrates that oil can be extracted in the Arctic without damaging
the environment. The 1990 Exxon Valdez spill occurred because of
deficiencies in the transportation system, not in drilling. 

<P> Oil output from production in Prudhoe Bay soon will begin
declining. Unless ANWR is developed, output from Alaska will steadily
fall. With ANWR, however, Alaska could keep pumping around 1.8 million
b/d or even more. The NES conservatively estimates ANWR's potential
output at 870,000 b/d by the year 2005. Oil from ANWR also would
extend the life of the Prudhoe Bay field. This is because without
ANWR, the volume of oil from Prudhoe Bay eventually will fall below
the level required to operate the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. 
<P>
** The Outer Continental Shelf

<P> The NES also recommends expanded drilling for new oil on the
Outer Continental Shelf (OCS), a portion of the Continental Plate
extending underneath the ocean's surface. The OCS is believed to
contain 7.5 billion barrels of oil and 9.4 trillion cubic feet of
natural gas; this would be 26 percent of America's undiscovered oil
and natural resources.    The Reagan Administration proposed orderly
development of OCS oil and gas resources in a way that would protect
the environment. This was blocked by a series of lawsuits and
congressional actions. Development of the OCS was further delayed when
the Bush Administration halted leasing in several OCS areas including
the coasts of California, Oregon, and Washington, the North Atlantic
coast, and a portion of the Eastern Gulf of Mexico. This leaves only
portions of the Gulf of Mexico and Mid and South Atlantic available
for development. The freeze on new leases apparently remains in force
for most of these areas until 1996, ostensibly to allow environmental
and economic studies. Some OCS areas off California, however, will not
be available for leasing until the year 2000. 

<P> Environmental concerns obviously are important. But so is
American energy security. The two do not exclude each other.
Technological advances in recent years have reduced significantly the
chances of spills from offshore drilling. In fact, there have been no
major spills at U.S. offshore facilities since 1969 when a well off
the coast of Santa Barbara, California, blew out, fouling miles of
beach. Safety measures developed as a result of this spill make a re-
occurrence unlikely. Today, indeed, there is far less environmental
risk from drilling offshore wells and transporting oil to shore by
pipeline than there is from transporting oil from other nations by
tankers. 

<P> The NES recommends that those areas in which leasing has been
halted be considered for inclusion in a five-year leasing plan being
drafted by the Department of the Interior. The NES also suggests that
Congress ban none of the new areas under consideration for the five-
year leasing plan until a study is completed that weighs resource
potential and environmental effects of energy development.
<P>
** The Tax Problem

<P> For more than two decades, unfavorable tax treatment of the oil
industry has contributed significantly to the decline of American
domestic oil production. Addressing this, the NES recommends some tax
code changes. These would give somewhat more favorable tax treatment
to so-called "marginal oil production." This is the output from wells
that are nearly exhausted. The NES also calls for better tax treatment
for "unconventional" natural gas production, such as that from coal
seams. 

<P> In its proposed tax changes, the NES stops far short of what is
needed to remove the tax code's penalties on domestic oil production.
The oil industry is treated more harshly by the tax code than any
other sector of the economy. Since 1969, for example, most oil
producers have lost what is knowm as "the depletion allowance." This
is the accounting mechanism that recognizes that as oil is extracted
from the ground, the oil company's capital is depleted -- just as a
manufacturing firm's capital would be depleted as machinery
deteriorated. The depletion allowance for mineral development is the
equivalent of depreciation for a manufacturing business. It is an
allowance that is used as a deduction from taxable income. Loss of the
depletion allowance of course drives up the cost of oil production in
America.

<P> Also driving up the cost is the 1976 law, enacted by Congress
and approved by Gerald Ford, that imposes a minimum tax on what it
called "intangible drilling costs." These typically are the costs of
building roads to oil well sites, of the "muds" used to lubricate the
rotating shaft of an oil rig, and of the energy used to operate the
rig. Such costs from 1976 to last year were taxed at 10 percent of
their value. Last year's tax hike package boosted this tax to 24
percent. The tiny tax credit given to the oil industry last year
offers little real relief. Why drilling costs themselves should be
taxed is, of course, the question. In every other industry these would
be treated as normal business expenses to be deducted from revenues.
Yet for oil drillers they are effectively treated as income.

<P> Further adding to the burden on the oil industry is the 1980
special tax on oil companies to finance the Superfund, the federal
program to clean hazardous waste sites. Other taxes harm the oil
industry as well. Taxes on refined petroleum products were increased
several times for such diverse reasons as to fund mass transit and
help reduce the deficit. These taxes are imposed specifically on the
oil industry; other industries do not pay them.    A 1987 Energy
Department report on energy security concludes that American oil
production would be increased were the full depletion allowance
restored. The report also calls for a 5 percent tax credit for oil
exploration and development costs and for the removal of tax penalties
on the industry. Taken together, these changes would add 1,233,000 b/d
to domestic production within a decade. While the 1987 report also
found that these changes would reduce Treasury revenues by $7.622
billion over roughly the same period, it failed to take into account
the new revenues that would be received by the Treasury from wages
paid to workers employed to develop the new oil, and from royalties on
oil and gas produced on federal lands. With these new revenues, the
Treasury would collect an extra $40 billion over the decade.
<P>
WESTERN HEMISPHERIC ENERGY SECURITY

<P> The NES strongly supports developing non-Persian Gulf oil
supplies. The NES specifically targets Eastern Europe and the Western
Hemisphere for development. The NES also urges a review of U.S. laws
to ensure they do not discourage energy development. If production
outside the Persian Gulf is not encouraged, 41 percent of world oil
supplies will come from that region by the year 2010. Known oil
reserves outside the Persian Gulf total about 337 billion barrels;
this is about half the 654 billion barrel reserve in the Persian Gulf.

<P> The greatest opportunity for expanding secure production outside
the Persian Gulf is in the Western Hemisphere. The nations of North
and South America have proved oil reserves of over 156 billion barrels
and natural gas reserves of over 518 trillion cubic feet. The
hemisphere also has 30 percent of the world's coal reserves and 42
percent of its hydroelectric power capacity. 

<P> Latin American countries, of course, generally are more
politically stable and friendlier to the U.S. than are Middle Eastern
countries. 

<P> To increase use of the Western Hemisphere's energy resources,
energy trade should be allowed to flow freely across the borders of
all nations in the Americas through the creation of a common market
for energy. The Western Hemisphere readily could meet its own energy
needs, and even export energy. Latin America could produce as much as
3.5 million more b/d. 

<P> For Latin America, increased energy trade with the U.S. could
help reduce the enormous Latin American foreign debt. For the U.S.,
increased reliance on hemispheric energy sources would improve energy
security. To increase cooperation on energy trade within the
hemisphere, a number of steps must be taken. One of the most important
is the elimination of barriers to foreign investment common in Latin
America. 

<P> The U.S. and Canada made a good start towards a hemispheric
common market in energy with their 1988 Free Trade Area agreement. It
provides for unrestricted oil and electricity trade across borders.
Natural gas so far is not covered by the agreement, since it is highly
regulated in both countries. 

<P> A key element to an energy free trade area would be the
reduction and eventual elimination of laws, especially in Mexico and
the Latin American countries, that prohibit foreign investment in
resource development, or set confiscatory tax rates on profits from
such investments.
<P>
** The Venezuelan Example

<P> A promising development is the proposed Cristobal/Colon joint
venture in Venezuela. The project involves the export of liquefied
natural gas (LNG) from Venezuela to the U.S. The partners include
Exxon Corporation, Royal Dutch/Shell Group, Mitsubishi Corporation,
and a subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela, the Venezuelan National
Oil Company. This is the first time in decades that Venezuela is
permitting foreign participation in an energy project. Venezuela is
expected soon to revise its tax laws to make the Cristobal/Colon
project economically viable. A successful Cristobal/Colon project
could serve as a model for cooperation throughout the Hemisphere. The
government of Argentina, meanwhile, is privatizing its oil industry,
one of the most inefficient in the Hemisphere. This should increase
production and foreign participation and give Argentina an incentive
to seek freer energy trade in the Hemisphere. Though Mexico still
resists privatizing its oil industry or allowing foreign companies to
own equity shares in the industry, this will be addressed in the
current U.S.-Mexico free trade area talks.
<P>
DOMESTIC NATURAL GAS

<P> Natural gas accounts for more than one-fifth of America's
primary energy, and is used to heat nearly half of all homes. The NES
cites natural gas as one of the most promising alternatives to oil,
suggesting that it could replace up to 600,000 b/d of oil use by 1995,
and 1.7 million b/d by 2000. 

<P> Natural gas when burned as fuel produces less air pollution than
oil or coal, and the technology to convert from oil to natural gas is
well established. Most important, America has natural gas in vast
quantities.

<P> Natural gas competes directly with oil in the industrial boiler
fuel market, with natural gas accounting for 37 percent and oil only
36 percent of all industrial energy used in 1989. Coal accounts for
most of the balance. Virtually all of the oil burned in industrial
boilers, or roughly 24.7 percent of total American oil consumption,
could be replaced by natural gas. Many boilers are designed to use
either fuel and can be switched back and forth in response to the
relative price of the two fuels. 
<P>
** Pipeline Construction Barriers

<P> The NES finds that statutory and regulatory impediments are
reducing American natural gas usage by 1 trillion cubic feet per year.
This amount could displace 470,000 b/d of oil. In some cases,
particularly in the Northeast, industrial boilers cannot use natural
gas because there are no pipelines to deliver it. Pipeline
construction often is stymied by a federal regulatory approval process
which can take five times as long as it does for the actual pipeline
to be built. 

<P> The cumbersome regulatory system was designed in the days when
some pipeline firms enjoyed near monopoly power in some regions.
Today, with over 1.3 million miles of pipeline and a choice of routes
available in most cases, monopoly no longer is a problem. Yet the
antiquated approval process remains, hurting rather than protecting
the consumer. Reducing regulations would speed pipeline construction,
significantly lower transportation costs, and make natural gas more
attractive as a fuel.

<P> The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the body that
oversees approval of interstate natural gas pipelines and regulates
their rates, recognizes the problem and is trying to reform its
procedures administratively with the support of the Bush White House.
The NES endorses this and suggests clarifying confusing provisions of
the 1938 Natural Gas Policy Act. It recommends that pipeline companies
be allowed to proceed without federal certification if they forego the
right to exercise federal eminent domain in obtaining the private
property needed for the pipeline. Under current regulations, federal
certification of a pipeline entitles the pipeline company to invoke
eminent domain.
<P>
** Natural Gas Pipeline Pricing

<P> The price that natural gas pipelines charge for their services
has been regulated by Washington since the Natural Gas Act of 1938.
The NES calls for a reversal of this and for deregulation of pipeline
prices so long as pipeline customers have access to alternative
sources of energy supplies. Today, pipeline companies can refuse to
transport natural gas for producers not affiliated with them. But
because these companies usually enjoy a monopoly in their service
areas, such refusals restrict competition. Requiring pipeline
companies with local, government-supported monopolies to transport
natural gas for other companies would improve competition.

<P> The NES recommends reforming the pipeline rate structure to
encourage efficient use. Current rules often force pipeline owners to
charge higher prices for their services during periods of low use, to
cover the pipeline costs even though demand is low. Conversely, during
periods of peak use, pipeline owners are forced to underprice their
services to avoid making profits higher than those allowed by the
regulators. The NES suggests that FERC permit pipeline owners to sell
their excess capacity during periods of low use, and to buy additional
capacity from other pipelines during peak periods. This would help
even out the pipeline transportation load and increase efficiency. 
<P>
** Regulation of Gas Imports and Exports

<P> Natural gas imports and exports are regulated by the Department
of Energy. America last year imported about 8 percent of its natural
gas, primarily from Canada. By the year 2000, American natural gas
imports are expected to rise to around 12 percent of natural gas
consumption, and by 2010 to 14 percent. The U.S exports a small amount
of liquefied natural gas to Japan. Vast amounts of Alaskan natural gas
could be sold to Japan were it not for the federal limits on exports.
The NES recommends ending the Energy Department's authority over gas
import and export transactions. 

<P>
DOMESTIC COAL

<P> Coal is America's most abundant fuel, accounting for 90 percent
of American energy resources. Coal use has grown sharply in recent
years. In 1970, for example, the U.S. consumed 523.2 million tons of
coal, in 1980, 702.7 million tons, and in 1990, 894.6 million tons,
accounting for 23 percent of American energy needs. By 2010, American
coal use could rise to 1.6 billion tons. Coal also is a major export,
with more than 100 million tons sold last year. Increased use of coal,
however, could be hindered by the tightened environmental regulations
in the Clean Air Act of 1990. The NES cites the Energy Department's
Clean Coal Technology (CCT) program, initiated in 1986, as a way to
permit increased coal use and still protect the environment. To
accelerate the CCT program, the NES recommends reforming federal coal
leasing policies, reforming regulations concerning coal mining safety
and health, and encouraging greater use of coal slurry pipelines. 
<P>
** Promoting Coal Production

<P> The Clean Coal Technology Program aims at developing new
technologies to burn coal cleaner, with less pollution. For the CCT to
succeed, sufficient quantities of low-sulfur coal must be burned. Much
of this type of coal is on federal land. The NES recommends that the
Department of Interior's Federal Coal Leasing Program insure that
adequate low-sulfur coal areas are offered for lease. At the same
time, NES calls on the Bureau of Mines to continue research and
development on technologies to address environmental concerns about
underground coal mining. It also calls for continued tax credits for
extracting the marketable methane gas found in the underground coal
beds. 
<P>
** Regulatory Reform 

<P> The NES stresses the need to eliminate the uncertainty about the
kind of environmental regulations that are to be imposed under the
1977 Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act. This act has been
inconsistently applied. Reform is especially important to low-sulfur
coal production, most of which is extracted from surface mines.

<P> The NES also calls for performance-based standards for mine
safety and health regulations. Adopting performance-based standards,
where results, rather than specific federally-imposed methods, are
used to measure compliance, will permit a more rapid introduction of
technological improvements and improve worker safety.
<P>
** Coal Slurry Pipelines

<P> Coal slurry pipelines, in which pulverized coal mixed with water
is transported as a liquid, reduce coal transportation costs. Since
almost all prospective slurry pipeline routes will cross over or under
highways, rail lines, and other private property, slurry pipelines
require that government exercise the right of eminent domain to obtain
the right-of-way for the pipelines. This is done for right-of-way for
electric wires, roads, and rails. Because slurry pipelines use large
amounts of water, there has been great opposition to granting pipeline
builders eminent domain in Western states where water is scarce. Yet
large deposits of low-sulfur coal are in the West, and rail transport
of the coal to Eastern markets is much more costly than transport by
slurry pipelines. The NES correctly supports granting eminent domain
to slurry pipeline builders once all questions concerning water rights
and usage have been satisfied.
<P>
** Clean Air Act Amendments

<P> The Clean Air Act of 1990 mandates that annual emissions of
sulfur dioxide in the U.S. by the year 2000 will be at least 10
million tons below the 1980 level. The act further decrees that the
emissions level reached in the year 2000 will never be exceeded. The
act requires existing coal-burning electric utility plants to install
expensive devices to control emissions of nitrogen oxides. 

<P> These new requirements could seriously constrain American coal
use. While accepting the clean air goal set by the 1990 act, the NES
stresses that the goal can be met by accelerating the Clean Coal
Technology Program. This would be much less costly to the economy than
the devices called for by the Clean Air Act.
<P>
** The WEPCO Decision

<P> When the first Clean Air Act was passed in 1970, most existing
electrical generating plants were exempted from the new air quality
rules. At the time it was assumed that existing plants soon would be
replaced by new facilities that would be subject to the law. Yet, as
the expense and difficulties associated with building new electrical
generating plants increased, utilities typically decided to refurbish
existing plants rather than build new ones. In 1988, a decision by the
Environmental Protection Agency involving a plant refurbished by the
Wisconsin Electric Power Company (WEPCO) held that when a utility
makes "non-routine" changes in the operation, repair, or maintenance
of a unit, the plant may become subject to air quality rules. This
meant that the utility was required to install specific pollution
control devices mandated by regulations.

<P> Skyrocketing Cost. The effect of this decision on the WEPCO
plant was enormous. The capital cost for refurbishment jumped from $80
million to $120 million. It became necessary to cut the plant's size
from 400 megawatts to 320 megawatts. As a result, the cost of re-
outfitting the WEPCO plant rose by 87.5 percent overall. Worse still,
the EPA indicated that it will determine what constitutes a "non-
routine" refurbishment case by case. As a result, utilities deciding
how to meet future power requirements must assume that any
refurbishment will fall under the WEPCO precedent. 

<P> The WEPCO decision illustrates the uncertainties that the
inconsistent and unpredictable application of regulations can
introduce into the market. The NES correctly suggests that the Energy
Department work with the EPA to identify the areas of regulation that
create planning uncertainties for electric utilities with older
plants, and strive to make the revisions necessary to clarify them. A
more basic question, however, as with the WEPCO decision, is whether
the EPA will continue to resist performance-based standards for public
utilities. Unlike the more traditional command and control "cookbook"
approach, such standards emphasize results. If EPA resists this
approach, the Administration should take direct action against EPA to
assure the adoption of such sound policy.
<P>
NUCLEAR POWER

<P> Although nuclear plants generate around 20 percent of American
electricity, for all practical purposes American nuclear energy
development is at a standstill. Because of public opposition and
excessive regulation, no new nuclear plants have been ordered in
America since 1978; only three remain scheduled for construction. More
than 100 orders have been cancelled or deferred. 

<P> Still, nuclear energy remains an attractive way to generate
electricity. It is clean and relatively safe. America has huge
deposits of uranium, the source of nuclear fuel. The NES estimates
that America will need from 190 gigawatts to 275 gigawatts of new
electrical generation capacity by the year 2010 (a gigawatt is one
billion watts). Currently it takes two coal-fired plants or one
nuclear plant to produce a gigawatt. Most of America's added energy
will be generated by large, centralized plants, known as "base load
generation." These are best suited to nuclear power.

<P> To give nuclear energy a new chance, the NES addresses several
important issues.
<P>
** Advanced Powerplant Designs

<P> The accidents at the Three Mile Island nuclear facility in
Pennsylvania in 1979 and at the Chernobyl facility in Ukraine in 1986
heightened public concern over plant safety. Since 1979, the
Department of Energy has been researching advanced light-water
reactors (ALWRs), which will be safer than current designs. By 1995,
the ALWR design should be complete and a prototype could be operating
by 2000. Other advanced designs are also being developed. Among the
most promising is the Modular High-Temperature Gas Reactor. With it,
if all external power systems were to fail, the reactor would simply
shut itself down. The NES endorses these research and development
efforts.
<P>
** Licensing Reform and Design Standardization

<P> Delays encountered in licensing nuclear power plants long have
been among the nuclear industry's greatest problems. The licensing
process in America can take up to fifteen years compared to less than
five years in Japan or France. Unlike other governments, Washington
reserves key licensing approvals until after a plant is built. As a
result, a utility can have a completed plant costing a billion dollars
sitting idle because of a regulatory delay.

<P> This process is complicated further by the tendency of electric
utilities to order unique designs for each plant. This subjects each
plant to its own exhaustive review process. In France and Japan, by
contrast, it has long been the practice to use standardized models for
nuclear plants. Besides reducing licensing delays, standardization is
believed to improve safety by reducing the number of new and untried
components. The NES agrees that power plant designs should be
standardized so that reviews need take place only once. 
<P>
** Managing High-Level Nuclear Waste

<P> Another major problem facing the nuclear industry is the growing
backlog of undisposed high-level nuclear waste, that is, highly
radioactive byproducts of nuclear power production that require
special disposal. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 directs the
Department of Energy to establish a permanent repository for such
waste, and a monitored retrievable storage facility (MRS) to hold the
waste prior to permanent disposal. Yet just about all localities
strongly oppose being the site of these repositories. As with other
problems facing the nuclear industry, establishing these repositories
is as much a matter of public perception as of technology. Although
the NES suggests that Congress establish disposal sites, the political
battle surrounding such decisions will result in further delays.
<P>
RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES

<P> Renewable energy sources are those that are not depleted. The
three principal renewable sources in America are hydroelectric power,
geothermal power, and ethanol, produced from corn, grains, and other
biological material. Solar power is a much less important renewable
source. In 1990, renewable energy supplied 8 percent of American
energy needs. Of this, about 47 percent came from hydroelectric dams.
Solar power of all types accounted for under 6 percent of all
renewable energy and less than one half of one percent of American
energy needs. Renewable energy sources other than hydroelectric power
or wood have grown in importance significantly since 1970, when they
were virtually nonexistent. The NES strongly endorses the use of
renewable energy, and calls for continued research and development in
this area. 
<P>
** Renewable Energy and Electricity

<P> The NES recommends removing from the Public Utility Regulatory
Policies Act of 1978 (PURPA) restrictions on the size of renewable
energy plants. These restrictions are a holdover from the Carter
Administration's emphasis on so-called "soft-path" energy schemes,
which emphasized small-scale plants. These provisions made neither
economic nor technological sense.

<P> All hydro-electric plants are licensed by the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission, and the licenses periodically must be renewed.
The licensing process has become extremely cumbersome. The NES
suggests exempting very small hydro projects from FERC regulation, and
streamlining the licensing process for all other plants.
<P>
** Ethanol

<P> In 1978, Congress allowed a five-cent per gallon exemption from
the federal gasoline tax for motor fuels blended with ethanol. And in
1980, the federal government granted a tax credit for refiners
producing gasoline blended with ethyl tertiary butyl ether (ETBE), an
ethanol-based gasoline additive. Because ethanol is more expensive
than gasoline, its advocates believe a tax credit is warranted to
allow ethanol to compete with gasoline. A look at the performance of
ethanol in the market, however, suggests that such a credit is not
needed. With around 10 percent of all gasoline being blended with
ethanol or ETBE the need for the subsidy has passed. Ethanol is well
established in the market and now competes with gasoline additives in
about the same price range, rather than with gasoline. Clean Air Act
of 1990 regulations effectively require many motorists in urban areas
to use gasoline with ethanol, ETBE, or some similar additive. The NES
thus errs in recommending that the ethanol tax credit continue.
Instead, the subsidies for ethanol and ETBE should be eliminated. 
<P>
** Fusion

<P> Fusion long has held out the promise of tapping a virtually
inexhaustible supply of energy without endangering the environment and
without producing hazardous wastes. The NES calls for continued
support of fusion energy research. This is wise, yet too much should
not be expected of fusion soon. Under the most optimistic assessments,
the first practical fusion energy plants will not be available until
the year 2035. 
<P>
IMPROVING ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY

<P> The needs to make America more energy secure and to protect the
environment too often have been in conflict. Measures designed to
protect the environment often wasted energy or restricted the use of
such plentiful sources as coal. 

<P> The NES emphasizes the need to clarify uncertainties about some
environmental issues that have impeded energy development. Typical of
these issues are the claims about global climate change. NES stresses
that research on these issues is essential before imposing regulations
that could have disastrous economic consequences for American
industries. The NES does call for measures to reduce the emission of
"greenhouse gases," which may contribute to atmospheric warming, while
the global warming issue is being studied. But NES specifies that
these measures be limited to those justified for reasons other than
potential global climate change.

<P> The NES wisely rejects the notion of a so-called "carbon tax" to
discourage fossil fuel use. Some environmentalists call for a $135-
per-ton tax on the carbon content of fuels. This would damage the
American economy enormously. 
<P>
CONCLUSION
<P> In the past, talk in Washington of an "energy policy" has meant
cumbersome regulations, expensive new bureaucracies, and costly
"conservation" programs and gas lines. How much energy, if any, is
saved by these measures is debatable. What is not debatable is the
enormous economic pain inflicted on Americans. A sound energy policy
is not built on more regulations. A sound policy rather should remove
impediments to the energy market, eliminate barriers to energy
production, and facilitate innovation. This is what the National
Energy Strategy recommends. America's level of foreign oil imports is
too high -- not because oil imports are "bad" for America but because
dependence on oil from unfriendly and insecure parts of the world
carries the risk of future damaging economic shocks. 

<P> Removing Tax Bias. America can increase domestic energy
production and increase exploration to find new reserves if Congress
and the White house amend the tax code to remove the bias against
firms taking the risks necessary to find new energy supplies, if
Congress and the White House allow exploration in the most promising
areas for new oil discoveries, if Congress and the White House remove
the regulatory impediments now discouraging gas producers and
utilities from fostering greater use of natural gas, and if Congress
and the White House encourage conservation by permitting the market to
reflect the true cost of energy. 

<P> Americans, too, could move closer to secure foreign sources of
supply if the U.S. were to negotiate a common market for energy
throughout the Western Hemisphere.

<P> Core Strategy. Americans enjoy one of the world's highest
standards of living in large part because they have had ready access
to abundant, inexpensive sources of energy. Continued access to
abundant energy is essential to America's economic future, and history
teaches that the best way to achieve this access is to permit markets
to operate. Reliance on markets assures both abundant supplies and
judicious use. As such, above all else, the core of any national
energy strategy must be to permit markets to operate.
