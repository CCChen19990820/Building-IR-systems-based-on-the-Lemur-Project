<OL>
<LI><a href="#dole">On Tuesday Bob Dole</a> called Clinton a tax and spend liberal. Covering Dole's speech, CBS asserts that the "ex-deficit hawk" must "do more than criticize." NBC says Dole's latest themes reflect a "campaign of fear."
<LI><a href="#hillary">A federal report concludes that Hillary Clinton deliberately "deceived" federal regulators,</a> but the broadcast networks don't report on the report.
<LI><a href="#donaldson">Sam Donaldson</a> and a USA Today reporter charge that their media colleagues are going easier on Clinton than they did on Reagan and Bush.

<a name="dole">
<FONT  SIZE=+2>1) Before the Economic Club of Detroit</FONT> on Tuesday Bob Dole
said Bill Clinton is a liberal bent on raising taxes. ABC's World
News Tonight on Tuesday (September 24) didn't mention the speech. 
<P>
On the CBS Evening News, Phil Jones charged that supporting a
tax cut means Dole is no longer concerned about the deficit.
Jones also worried that criticizing Clinton isn't the right
strategy. 
<P>
<DD>Jones reported: "The former Senator argued that voters have a
choice between two different visions of government."
<BR><DD>Dole: "He wants families to pinch their pennies so government can
spend more money. I've got a new idea. I want the government for
a change to pinch its pennies so the families will not have to
pinch theirs."
<BR><DD>Jones: "The ex-deficit hawk returned to the centerpiece of his
campaign, a 15 percent tax cut."
<BR><DD>Dole: "I know the critics say you can't do this, you can't cut
taxes and balance the budget. What they're really saying is that
they cannot do it."
<BR><DD>Jones: "Campaign aides claim they have private polls showing
President Clinton vulnerable on the tax issue. That's the reason
for this attack. But between now and election day the Republican
nominee has to do more than criticize. He's got to sell the Dole
plan."
<P>
After showing some of the same tax soundbites from Dole, on
NBC Nightly News David Bloom ran a clip of a new Clinton ad which
criticizes Dole's Senate record, emphasizing Dole's length of
service. Bloom then charged:
<BR><DD>"So now Dole who's complained about Clinton's campaign of fear is
taking a similar tack."
<BR><DD>Dole: "Secrets, secrets. Remember the FBI files that went to the
White House."
<BR><DD>Bloom: "With the election just six weeks away, calling Bill
Clinton a liberal might soon look tame. David Bloom, NBC News, Detroit."
<P>
<a name="hillary">
<FONT  SIZE=+2>2) "FDIC Report Says Mrs. Clinton's Work Was Used to
Deceive,"</FONT> declared the front page Washington Post headline on
Tuesday. The news was also played above the fold in The
Washington Times. But neither the Monday or Tuesday night ABC,
CBS or NBC evening shows mentioned the development. 
<P>
Post reporter Susan Schmidt's lead: "Hillary Rodham Clinton
drafted a real estate document that was used by an Arkansas S&L
to 'deceive' federal regulators in 1996 and pay more than $300,000
in questioned commissions to one of her law firm's well-connected
clients, a federal inspector general concluded yesterday. The
strongly worded report by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
inspector general found evidence that Clinton and her former law
partner Webster Hubbell were involved in dealings on behalf of
Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan that they have told federal
investigators under oath they cannot recall."
<P>
<a name="donaldson">
<FONT  SIZE=+2>3) An expert media observer</FONT> who had up close, insider
access to how the media covered Ronald Reagan's 1984 re-election
campaign says reporters are going a lot easier on Clinton this
year. The expert: Sam Donaldson. With Brit Hume out ill last
week, Donaldson returned to the campaign trail for the first time
since Reagan's years. And things have changed, USA Today's Peter
Johnson reported Monday (September 23):
<BR><DD>"Have the boys on the bus lost the fire in their bellies, the
one that fueled their cries of 'Mr. President! Mr. President!'
during President Reagan's years in office? ABC's Sam Donaldson
isn't saying, exactly, but suspects something's going on. Except
for CBS' Rita Braver, 'I have heard no reporter trying to ask the
President any question,' Donaldson said Friday....
<BR><DD>"What's this, Sam? Reporters going easy on Clinton? 'You're not
going to get me in a fight with these guys. They're my friends,'
said Donaldson, who covered the White House from 1977 to 1989.
'But there seems to a change in attitude or a different attitude
toward covering the President.'"
<P>
A USA Today reporter agrees. In his "Politics" column on
Monday, Richard Benedetto wrote:
<BR><DD>"As President Clinton's re-election campaign rolled through
six states in four days last week, it did so virtually unimpeded
by a White House press corps known for setting up roadblocks now
and then....He was left free to make a string of feel-good
speeches that won great play in the media and gave the desired
impression that the Clinton campaign is on a roll....
<BR><DD>"In 1992, a tough White House press corps rightly kept
President Bush's feet to the fire on domestic issues he would
rather have downplayed. But the 1996 crew appears less aggressive
with Clinton."
<P>We're bringing them to our side, one reporter at a time.

<OL>
<LI> <a href="#dole">Bob Dole</a> is losing. What's to blame? The fact that he's failed
to nail down his conservative base? No, ABC says -- surprise,
surprise -- that he's moved "too far to the right."

a former Clinton Press Secretary turned liberal commentator.
<li> <a href="#gumbel">Bryant Gumbel</a> urges prayer for children because of the welfare

<p>
<br>
<br>
<a name="dole"></a>
<h3>1) </h3><dd>It could be argued that Bob Dole is losing because he
lacks conservative passion, that conservatives don't trust that
he'll follow through on his conservative promises. But that's not
a view ABC took Monday night. On the September 23 World News
Tonight reporter Dean Reynolds explored why Dole is behind in
Michigan's 8th congressional district, the Lansing area. In 1992
the networks didn't blame conservatives for Bush's impending loss
until October. This year ABC made an early start.
<dd>
    Reynolds found people happy with the economy and cynical
about the political process. Reynolds explained: "The same
cynicism that may deflect attacks on Clinton, seems to work
directly against Bob Dole with many voters here calling his 15
percent tax cut idea a political gimmick."
<dd>
    Following a soundbite from a teacher who asserted that you
can't cut taxes without increasing the deficit and who then
denounced Newt Gingrich, Reynolds relayed: "Many of the voters we
spoke with blamed Gingrich for last year's government shut down,
for a mean-spirited attitude generally, and for attempts to trim
Medicare specifically."
<dd>
    Reynolds then aired a soundbite from Ron Bell, a man on golf
course: "I think that anybody that came out as strong as Mr.
Gingrich did when he first came out regarding Medicare was
committing political suicide and I think the Republican Party
took too long before they tried to quiet him down."
<dd>Reynolds: "And Ron Bell is a life-long Republican."
<dd>    Interviewer, off camera: "Your party. Did it move too far to
the right?"
<dd>    Bell: "Yes, far too far to the right."
<dd>    Reynolds: "That may explain why Dole is having trouble
winning over women voters."
<dd>    Woman in restaurant: "I am a Republican and I'm having some
troubles with the platform because I'm pro-choice."
<dd>    2nd woman in restaurant: "I think abortion is not a political
issue. It has no business in politics."
<dd>    Reynolds: "And where there is support for Dole, it often
sounds lukewarm."
<dd>    3rd woman in restaurant: "I will support Dole and most
probably vote for him, but it would have been nice if we had a
different candidate.
<dd>
    Reynolds concluded his story: "Across Michigan's 8th
district, from the city streets to the fields of corn, the Dole
campaign is struggling, trailing and has six weeks to catch up."
<dd>
    So busy portraying Dole as "too far to the right," Reynolds
failed to consider that maybe voters don't believe his tax cut
promise because Dole has a long record of raising taxes over
conservative objections. Reynolds also failed to look at how
Reagan and Bush managed to win with a pro-life message.
<p>
<br>
<br>
<a name="reporter"></a>
<h3>2) </h3><dd>Monday's Washington Post "Reliable Source" column
revealed that "Former White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers,
35, and New York Times White House reporter Todd Purdum, 36, are
engaged after dating seriously for about a year." Myers is now
the liberal co-host of CNBC's Equal Time.
<p>
<br>
<br>
<a name="gumbel"></a>
<h3>3) </h3><dd>The Children Defense Fund's Marian Wright Edelman
appeared on Monday's Today show (September 23) to promote the
paperback release of her book titled Guide My Feet. It's a collection
of "prayers and meditations for children."
<dd>
    Bryant Gumbel asked her: "In light of the new welfare reform
bill, do you think the children need more prayers than ever
before?"
<dd>
    Yes, that when they grow up they won't have to watch biased
morning show hosts like Bryant Gumbel. -- Brent Baker

<H3> 1)</H3><DD>Ronald Reagan left office more than seven years ago,
but he's still fodder for liberal TV script writers. At the
beginning of Wednesday night's Rockford Files movie special on
CBS, "Jim Rockford" (a private investigator played by James
Garner, for those of you who missed the 1970s), arrives at a
birthday party for the father of a former girlfriend he hasn't
seen for 15 years. 
<DD>
Upon seeing Rockford, the father says to him: "I was glad to
hear Megan say that you might show. Hey, I bet the Reagan years
were good to you, huh? S&L investigations, defense contractor
fraud."
<DD>
Rockford responded: "Matter of fact."
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<a name="Dole"> </a>
<H3>2)</H3><DD>A few hours earlier Wednesday night (September 18) Dan
Rather opened the CBS Evening News: "Bob Dole unloads his
strongest attack yet blaming President Clinton personally and
directly for rising drug crime."
<DD>
He then began the show with this assessment of the themes of
each candidate that put Clinton in a more positive light: 
<DD>
"Bob Dole and Bill Clinton targeted each other today, on
each other's turf. In California Dole gave star billing to
President Clinton in a new attack blaming both the President and
Hollywood for what he says is a lax attitude on drug abuse.
President Clinton's theme today was let's protect the
environment, parks and public lands together. He used the Grand
Canyon as his backdrop to declare almost two million acres of
Utah off limits to developers."
<DD>
Reporter Phil Jones reported on Dole and included some doubt
about the effectiveness of Dole's anti-drug slogan and concluded
by noting that "only eleven percent blame the Clinton
administration for the [drug] problem." Rita Braver then
reported on Clinton move "to stake his claim as the
environmental President." But Braver didn't include any
consideration of how Clinton's move was an anti-property rights
land grab. ABC and NBC at least aired soundbites from upset Utah
Senator Orrin Hatch, but CBS aired no dissenting voice. 
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<a name="CIA"></a>
<H3>3)</H3><DD>Thursday night's (September 19) InterNight on MSNBC
looked at the San Jose Mercury News story that the CIA 
coordinated cocaine sales in Los Angeles in the 1980s through a
Nicaraguan to pay for the Contras. The guests: the reporter
(Gary Webb), Jesse Jackson, a lawyer for a drug dealer,
Washington talk show host Joe Madison and his buddy, the wacky
as always Dick Gregory. The premise of course is that if the CIA
hadn't provided the drugs the residents of South Central would
not have become addicted to crack.
<DD>Here are a few of host Ed Gordon's less than probing
questions:
<DD>
    -- To Jesse Jackson: "Does it bother you that indeed, and I
think this is where you're going, the hypocrisy that might be
that those who backed the Contras at that time and said it was
for freedom fighters and the like would indeed turn their back
on this country's problems?"
<DD>
    -- To Dick Gregory: "Dick, I know that this is nothing new
to you in the sense of trying to keep people alert to what may
be going on across this country as relates to the government,
but as you compare it to things you've seen and heard in the
past where does this fall?"
<DD>
    -- To Joe Madison: "As Dick was saying, a conspiratorial
thing, something that is genocidal that many African-Americans
whisper and talk about that, or was it simply an economic
situation that they thought this was a quick way to make money
to send to the Contras?"
<BR>

<H3>4)</H3><DD>Study, from the front page of the September MediaNomics 
published by the MRC's Free Market Project:
<DD><B>Tax Cuts Concern Reporters, Medicare Increases Do Not Deficit Chicken Hawks</B>
<DD>"At the Republican convention, Bob Dole pledged to cut income
taxes by 15 percent, balance the budget, and leave Social
Security and Medicare untouched. Tough-minded reporters believed
none of it and shared their skepticism with a national
television audience," writes the Weekly Standard's David Frum in
the September 9 issue of that magazine.
<DD>But then, according to Frum, "Two weeks later, the Democrats met
in convention and, to put it simply, lied through their teeth
about their plans for Medicare. They accused Republicans, in Al
Gore's words, of wanting to `give health insurance rip-off
artists a license to change Medicare, to let this program for
our seniors wither on the vine. That's why they want to replace
Bill Clinton. But we won't let them.' Those remarks are
blatantly untrue, both about the Republican plans and about
Clinton's own. And the media said...nothing."
<DD>Is Frum correct? Are reporters more skeptical of Bob Dole's tax
rhetoric than of Bill Clinton's Medicare rhetoric? Media
Research Center analysts reviewed all of the stories about
either tax cuts or Medicare on ABC's World News Tonight, CBS
Evening News, NBC Nightly News, and CNN's World Today during the
month of August. The MRC's findings: While network journalists
were ardent deficit hawks when reporting on tax cuts, they lost
their deficit-cutting zeal when Democrats denounced Republican
Medicare plans.
<DD>There were a total of 24 stories during the month that
questioned whether Bob Dole could both cut taxes and balance the
budget. Only two stories questioned whether Bill Clinton could
erase the deficit while not advancing Medicare reforms in his
second term.
<DD>The reaction to the unveiling of Dole's tax plan was the same
across the networks. "Since Dole would leave Social Security,
Medicare, and defense untouched," reported CBS News
correspondent Phil Jones, "it's still unclear what would be cut
in order to pay for his tax cut." According to CNN's Gene
Randall, "Bob Dole has produced an economic plan that is getting
mixed reviews even from Republicans. The bipartisan Concord
Coalition on Sunday warned against election-year tax-cut
Santas."
<DD>NBC's Mike Jensen offered that "most analysts say it's not good
economics. Bob Dole says about a fourth of the tax cuts would be
paid for by an expanding economy, but the rest would have to
come from spending cuts, and those haven't been spelled out
yet." Over at ABC, correspondent John Cochran claimed that "if
critics say Dole's tax plan would lead to budget deficits of the
size of those dating back to the Reagan era, then his campaign
simply isn't going to worry about it for now."
<DD>
But what about Bill Clinton and Medicare? Economics columnist
Robert Samuelson, in the September 4 Washington Post, pointed
out that in the upcoming years "the only way to avoid (or
minimize) much higher taxes, the [Congressional Budget Office]
said, would be a mix of an older retirement age, reduced
benefits and a shift of Medicare toward managed care. On
Medicare, the Republicans proposed precisely such a
shift...Clinton's demolition of this effort confounds the CBO's
sensible advice."
<DD>
Only two network reporters questioned whether leaving Medicare
alone could be compatible with balanced budgets. "A generation
of baby boomers begins retiring within a decade," ABC's Jerry
King pointed out. "So, the bad news is, unless the politicians
find a way to cut entitlement spending, today's deficit
reductions will be impossible to sustain." ABC's Jeff Greenfield
reported that "with the huge baby boomer generation retiring in
about 15 years, those entitlement programs could take every
single dollar of the budget."
<DD>
King and Greenfield were the only reporters concerned about how
to "pay for" automatic Medicare spending increases. If Bill
Clinton won't reform Medicare in his next term, why aren't
reporters asking him which taxes he will raise?

<h2><a name="quote">QUOTE OF THE DAY</a></h2><p>

<i>"They listened to those reports of the people turning down the
dials when negative responses were made in San Diego. He did it
on the high road. He said this was to be a campaign of ideas, not
insults, no personal attacks. And I think a final thought, Dan.
This was a convention that was well-planned and well-thought out.
They had their themes and they hit the mark every day. And the
President hit the mark tonight."<p>
 -- CBS reporter Ed Bradley,
after Clinton's speech.</i><p>

<h2><a name="nasty">"Nasty</a> Little Scandal" Prompts Some New Clinton Scrutiny;
 Dick Morris Story Mars Pro-Clinton Euphoria<p></h2></center>

    The networks generally praised Bill Clinton's acceptance
speech last night, but earlier in the evening coverage
concentrated on the resignation of Clinton campaign strategist
Dick Morris after revelations of a relationship with a
prostitute. The Morris news forced some networks to discuss
issues suppressed the first three nights: Clinton's character and
whether Morris pushed him artificially to the right.<p>

    "Two of the best and brightest of their political generation,
both baby boomers," marveled Tom Brokaw of Clinton and Gore.
ABC's Sam Donaldson offered: "Clinton always gives a great
speech, and this was another one of them. But the record shows
that the next day he may give a different speech, change his
mind." <p>

    -- CBS and NBC evening shows led with Morris, but ABC's Peter
Jennings seemed annoyed that he had to even mention the
allegations. "Here in Chicago," Jennings began World News
Tonight, "the President has been fine tuning, as they say, the
speech he will be giving to this convention and to the country
tonight. And he has a lot to be pleased about. A very upbeat
convention. A very successful train trip here with rising poll
numbers to accompany it. And a very important set of statistics
about the economy today, which he will certainly point to as
evidence that the country should re-elect him. And then along
comes a nasty little scandal to take the edge off the good news
at least for one day." <p>

    -- Questions about liberal influences on Clinton. Tom Brokaw,
on NBC Nightly News, asked Tim Russert "Does this open the door
then...to some of the President's old friends, who are more left
of center than right of center?" Dan Rather to Ted Kennedy in
prime time: "Bob Dole said today with Morris gone President
Clinton has only around him now liberal aides, and that's going
to hurt him?"<p>

    --  Character issue raised on CNN and NBC, which were the
only networks to detail the Morris story. On the 7pm ET Inside
Politics, Judy Woodruff inquired of Vernon Jordan: "Does it say
anything about the President's judgment that he would turn again
and again over 20 years to a man like Dick Morris with the sort
of personal problems that he allegedly has?" As prime time began,
only CNN's Bernie Kalb and NBC's Lisa Myers noted the Star
reported Morris used a Clinton campaign hotel room and that he
allowed the woman to listen in on phone calls with Clinton.<p>

    -- The rank hypocrisy of Al Gore's speech Wednesday night
went unmentioned Thursday morning and evening. Gore said his
sister's death from lung cancer in 1984 prompted his anti-tobacco
crusade, but in 1988 he boasted of growing and selling tobacco.
The only exception came on CNN's Crossfire which showed the 1988
clip of Gore.<p>

<center><h2><a name="ted">The</a> Orator of "Robert Bork's America" Goes Negative Again 
Ted Kennedy's Hit Speech Goes Uncriticized</center></h2><p>

    Reporters continued to miss the hypocrisy of Clinton's
proclamation of an "ideas, not insults" campaign when matched
with the attack-dog rhetoric of podium speakers. Last night, Ted
Kennedy used the exact same literary device that two weeks ago
fueled media criticism of Republican Senator Kay Bailey
Hutchison. <p>

    Said Kennedy of the GOP platform: "It is the radical wish
list of the education-cutting, environmental-trashing,
Medicare-slashing, choice-denying, tolerance-repudiating,
gay-bashing, Social Security-threatening, assault-rifle-coddling,
government-closing, tax loophole-granting....minimum
wage-opposing Republican majority that dominated the delegations
in San Diego" <p>

    -- NBC's Lisa Myers asked Hutchison in San Diego: "Do you
think you went too far?" On PBS, Tom Brokaw said last night:
"Senator Edward M. Kennedy, still in full voice after all these
years in the United States Senate. The proud champion of the
liberal cause, addressing this convention hall once again as he
does every four years."<p>

    -- On CNN,Bernard Shaw asserted: "Sixteen years ago in New
York's Madison Square Garden, Sen. Edward Kennedy rallied the
Democratic Party. Tonight, he has done it again in Chicago." Ken
Bode added: "You need a partisan speech, one that puts it to the
other party. You get it at any convention. Ted Kennedy does it as
well as anybody could do it. Elder statesman of the party.
Eloquent."<p>

   -- CNN's Bill Schneider found code words: "What they're trying
to do is take advantage of Dole's age and portray him as sort of
out of it. He's kind of irrelevant. He's kind of a dupe. That the
ideas are the sinister ideas of Newt Gingrich, and even Jack Kemp
with his supply-side ideas." But that attack theme drew no
criticism.<p>

    -- Later, CNN's Judy Woodruff interviewed Kennedy: "Do you
really believe that the Republicans are as dangerous, that Bob
Dole is as dangerous, as you described in your remarks?" Bernard
Shaw queried: "You had a who's who of names tonight: Pat
Buchanan, Newt Gingrich, Jack Kemp, Rush Limbaugh, Ralph Reed,
Pat Robertson. What were you driving at?"<p>

    -- On CBS, where Bob Schieffer asked Sen. Hutchison in San
Diego how she felt being "Attack Dog Hutchison," Dan Rather
interviewed Kennedy last night but failed to ask him about the
speech or its tone.<p>


<center><h2><a name="convention">Convention</a>-Inspired Ratherisms</center></h2><p>

    Special events often inspire the folksy aphorisms known as
Ratherisms: <p>

    This is your classic case of two pounds of politics in a
one-pound bag. This hall is only a third the size of the Houston
Astrodome, where the last Republican convention was held." -- 
Dan Rather, leading off Republican coverage, August 12.<p>

    -- "She's expected to hit President Clinton rhetorically with
everything short of a tire tube." -- Rather on Kay Bailey
Hutchison, August 13 convention coverage.<p>

    -- "It looks like California's Governor Pete Wilson is out of
the doghouse. You know from his view he's been put so far back in
the doghouse they had to FedEx him daylight." -- Rather during
August 14 Republican convention coverage. <p>

    -- "The Vice President of the United States, Albert Gore Jr.
of Tennessee, age 48, is about to give an address in which he is
widely expected to hit Republicans with everything short of a
window weight." -- During August 28 Democratic convention.<p>

    -- "The consensus in the hall is that Albert Gore has scored
with what Harry Caray, the famous Chicago baseball announcer,
might call a home run ball." -- Rather during CBS Democratic
convention coverage, August 28. <p>

<center><h2><a name="sidebites">SIDEBITES</a></center></h2><p>

<h3>Dick Morris, Family Man</h3>

    Just a day before the Dick Morris prostitute story broke, USA
Today ran a profile. Susan Page's front page piece Wednesday
included this line: "He is a small man and a dapper dresser,
openly devoted to his no-nonsense wife."<p>


<h3>Moderate Liberalism</h3><p>

    Wednesday's New York Times insisted the Democratic Party
defined centrism, but the story listed some very liberal views.
The Democratic "platform takes a middle ground between the
unfettered capitalism and government-enforced morality es- poused
by Republicans and the welfare-state economics and Aquarian
values that once formed Democrats' image," reported David
Rosenbaum.<p>

    Four paragraphs later Rosenbaum summarized the "middle
ground" policies: "The Democrats call for government-paid
abortions for poor women, full civil rights for homosexuals, a
strong commitment to public schools, gun control, tobacco
regulations, a continuation of affirmative action programs and a
greater emphasis on environmental protection than on the
development of resources."<p>


<h3>Welfare Worries</h3><p>

    Clinton's promise to "fix" welfare reform didn't prompt
questions about his backing down on a promise. Instead, reporters
pressed from the left. On CBS last night Ed Bradley cornered U.S.
Rep. Ron Dellums: "I know you saw it not as welfare reform but
more as a budget cut. What does he have to do to fix it?" And,
"The President is expected to say tonight that he's going to
propose a $3.5 billion jobs program for welfare recipients, is
that enough?"<p>

<center><h2><a name="ignoring">Networks Forget 1988 Tobacco-Growing Boast 
Ignoring Al Gore's Inaccuracy, Nastiness</a></h2></center><p>

    The networks delivered praise for Al Gore's speech last
night, ignoring his factual inaccuracies and failing to note how
he had boasted of growing tobacco as recently as 1988, four years
after the death of his sister from lung cancer. After Gore's
talk, in which he explained that his sister's death motivated his
anti-tobacco views, the networks did talk to tobacco-state
delegates. NBC's David Bloom spoke to a Tennessee delegate who
"does not agree with this demonization of this industry."<p>

    "Well, Dan, in a word it was a barnburner," gushed Bob
Schieffer on CBS last night. Though Gore said Republicans wish to
allow "more poison in our air and drinking water," Schieffer
didn't find him nasty: "This was an old-fashioned poli- tical
speech, the kind of speech that politicians used to give before
politics turned so nasty with all those commercials on
television." Though Peter Jennings noted the "attack dog" role of
a VP, no one  mentioned how Gore falsely accused the GOP of
"cutting" Medicare, of wanting it to "wither on the vine," or his
claim of 100,000 new cops on the street. Last Sunday
Scripps-Howard pegged the number at 12,000.<p>

    The New York Times reported July 3 that in 1988, Al Gore told
an audience of tobacco farmers: "Throughout most of my life, I
raised tobacco. I want you to know that with my own hands, all of
my life, I put it in the plant beds and transferred it. I've hoed
it. I've dug in it. I've sprayed it, I've chopped it, I've
shredded it, spiked it, put it in the barn and stripped it and
sold it." No network mentioned this boast, but ABC, NBC and CNN
did suggest hypocrisy. Jennings noted that "tobacco companies are
here in Chicago wining and dining the hierarchy of the Democratic
Party." NBC's Tom Brokaw recalled that "the Gore family were
tobacco farmers." On CNN, Judy Woodruff suggested that Gore "was
responding to what was said in San Diego," where his tobacco
roots were highlighted.<p>

    -- Clinton's week of new spending promises hasn't generated
a flurry of questions about how his plans will be paid for, but
Dole's tax cut plan led to concern in San Diego about its impact
on the deficit. One exception: Early in prime time last night
CNN's Charles Bierbauer reviewed Clinton's spending plans and
noted "Republicans say that is the road back to big government."<p>

    -- In stark contrast to San Diego, the networks failed to
describe Tuesday speeches as harsh or mean attacks. The morning
shows didn't raise the idea in interviews with Democratic guests.<p>


    -- The power of unions within the Democratic Party finally
gets highlighted as ABC's World News Tonight and CNN in prime
time examine their role. See page 3. But for CBS the problem
isn't union influence moving the party left, but how President
Clinton is too conservative for the rank and file. <p>

<center><h2><a name="no">More Raves for Jackson & Cuomo, Citations of GOP "Sniping"
No Snarling Partisan Negativity in Chicago?</p></center></h2></a>

    Wednesday marked Day Two of ignoring negativity from the
podium in Chicago:<p>

    -- On ABC's World News Tonight, Peter Jennings argued: "There
was a rather personal attack on President Clinton by Mr. Dole."
In the ABC clip, Dole said: "Tonight they'll bash Republicans.
Tomorrow night the President will sound to everybody 'If you're
for it, I'm for it. If Bob Dole's for it, I'm for it. If Jesse
Helms is for it, I'm for it. Whoever is for it, I'm for it, and
that's why you should re-elect me, because I don't have any
philosophy, I don't have any beliefs, I don't have any
commitments." Sounds a lot like network complaints about welfare
reform.<p>

    Jim Wooten raved over Jackson and Cuomo: "For a quick moment,
deja vu...That old-fashioned voice, full-throated, fierce,
raising the rafters worth of Chicago conventions...This was a
glimpse of conventions past, when liberals were still the lions
of the party and rhetoric roared....And the delegates, most of
them much more liberal than their convention projects of their
party, celebrated this little touch of yesterday." Wooten said
Hillary "answered Republican sniping at her book on raising
children."<p>

    -- CBS Evening News correspondent Bob Schieffer echoed
Wooten: "During the Republican convention, the Doles disparaged
Mrs. Clinton's book It Takes A Village, saying instead it takes a
family to properly raise a child."<p>

    -- NBC's Tom Brokaw called Jesse Jackson "The father who
began on the outside looking in, the fiery liberal voice of
protest and change...The old lion still has his roar."
The Wednesday morning shows took the same approach to negativity:<p>

    -- CBS This Morning co-host Jose Diaz-Balart suggested: "Mrs.
Clinton, you know, has been the target of a lot of attacks by the
Republican Party. She decided not to answer them, although she
did say it takes a village."<p>

    -- On NBC's Today, Jim Miklaszewski proclaimed: "This was the
night for the liberals. Jesse Jackson electrified the delegates,
exhorting them not to abandon Democratic liberal traditions."
Bryant Gumbel asked: "Would it be fair to say she wasn't as
strident, as hard-edged last night as usual?" Miklaszewski
dissented from the media's party line: "If you listen closely, I
thought she was just as hard-edged as ever."<p>

    -- ABC's Good Morning America co-host Charles Gibson
explained: "Mrs. Clinton expressed the core idea of the evening,
that government ought to be a proactive positive force, that idea
given forceful voice by two liberal icons who opposed President
Clinton's signing of welfare reform...the First Lady relied not
on her legal experience -- there would be no harsh edges on this
night -- but on her experience as a mother to push for new
legislation."<p>

    ABC interviewed Leon Panetta, and NBC interviewed the First
Lady, but asked no questions about negativity. Two weeks ago, the
morning shows all decried "bashing":<p>

   -- CBS This Morning co-host Jane Robelot reported August 14:
"It was unofficially Bash Bill Night last night in San
Diego...Speaker after Republican speaker went after the man with
a vengeance, including the keynoter, Susan Molinari."<p>

   -- "Congresswoman Susan Molinari took on the role of attack
dog last night, using her keynote address to attack the
President," Bryant Gumbel led off NBC's Today.<p>

    -- Good Morning America anchor Elizabeth Vargas asserted:
"Some of the harshest words were from Kay Bailey Hutchison, who
tried to paint the President as a tax-and-spend liberal." Charles
Gibson added: "Polls will tell you these days that people do not
want much partisanship in their politics, but they got it at the
Republican convention last night. There were attacks on President
Clinton's credibility, integrity, even his eating habits."<p>


<center><h2><a name="where">Broder</a> Sounds A Rare Skeptical Note on Clinton, Welfare Fixer
Where Are Welfare Questions from the Right?</center></h2><p>

    Clinton officials assured conventioneers that he will "fix"
welfare reform after the election. That prompted The Washington
Post's David Broder, on CNN Tuesday night, to explain that
Democrats will be "the slickest sales people in the country" if
they cast Clinton as welfare's savior: "That's as logical as
saying that the guy who fumbled the ball on the two-yard line
ought to be put back in because he's the one who might carry it
through the next time." The networks have yet to suggest that his
welfare fix assurance might mean he really hasn't moved right on
the issue. Instead, liberal questions on welfare reform continued
on Wednesday night: <p>

    -- CBS reporter Ed Bradley asked Rep. John Lewis: "It's going
to be difficult, given the positions he's taken, particularly on
welfare, to get some people out?"<p>

    -- CNN's Gene Randall inquired of NAACP leader Kweisi Mfume:
"Do you think the President's signature on the welfare rights
bill will do him any harm politically in the African-American
community?"<p>

   -- On CNN Bob Franken asked Sen. Daniel Moynihan: "You of
course are very angry about the President signing the  welfare
legislation. But you haven't talked about it here. Why?" She
followed up: "Can the President, as many people suggest, fix the
welfare legislation in a second term?"<p>

    -- At the top of Tuesday's Nightline on the plight of
Chicago's poor, Ted Koppel warned: "They live literally in the
shadow of the convention in Chicago, but with their benefits now
in doubt, many feel betrayed by the President and the Democrats,
and look forward only to uncertainty."<p>



<center><h2><a name="labor">Labor's</a> Political Intolerance, Mob Ties Surface on TV
ABC, CNN Touch on Unions' Peculiar Politics</center></h2><p>

    While the labor unions have yet to receive the sort of Darth
Vader treatment reserved for Republican interest groups like the
Christian Coalition or the NRA, some reporters have presented
critical looks at the exercise of union power.<p>

    -- Last night, CNN became the first network to address the
issue of the unions' political intolerance, taking dues money
from Republican union members to elect Democrats. Reporter Wolf
Blitzer asked AFL-CIO chief John Sweeney: "Many of your members
are Republicans. How do you explain to them that you're using, in
effect, their dues to help elect Democrats?"<p>

    -- CNN campaign finance reporter Brooks Jackson delivered a
story last night on the unions' political campaign in which he
observed: "So Bill Clinton says the era of big government is
over? Not at the Democratic convention, where unionized
government workers are suiting up for battle against
Republicans."<p>

    -- On Tuesday's World News Tonight, ABC's Brian Ross
reported: "In the world of big money and Democratic politics on
public display this week in Chicago, this man holds a special
place. His name is Arthur Coia, who despite being president of a
labor union the FBI says has long been controlled by the Mafia,
the Laborers International has become one of the Democrats' top
money people, raising millions and gaining him special access to
the Clinton White House....In the last two years, the Clinton
administration has gone all out to court Coia and his union money
with invitations to the White House and an appearance by the
First Lady at a big union conference."<p>

    Ross added detail: "In an abrupt change of plans that raised
questions about whether the union's money to the Democrats had
bought it some kind of sweetheart deal, prosecutors dropped the
allegations and instead quietly negotiated a deal with Coia that
let him keep his job and put him in charge of cleaning up the
union."<p>


<center><h2><a name="sidebites">SIDEBITES</a></center></h2><p>

<h3>Base Bias</h3><p>

    CBS Evening News is taking two different approaches to the
passionate poles that create each party's base. The day before
the Republican convention, CBS reporter John Roberts suggested
"hard-line anti-abortionists" controlled the Republican Party:
"Delegates are pursuing their own agendas and forcing party
leaders, including Dole, to fall into line behind them...so far
he rogue elephants seem to be calling the shots." <p>

    But on last night's broadcast, reporter Harry Smith's piece
on unions didn't talk about ideologically extreme unions pushing
around the party, but how Bill Clinton has failed to be liberal
enough for them:<p>

    "It still takes steel to make America's cars. It still takes
labor to get a Democrat elected President. But talk to the union
rank and file, and you'll find that their enthusiasm is less than
red hot.... We talked with United Auto Workers in Dearborn,
Michigan this week. Their biggest gripe: Bill Clinton's support
of the North American Free Trade Agreement...Organized labor will
invest millions of dollars to get Bill Clinton elected this fall.
These dues-paying members wonder if they are still getting their
money's worth."<p>


<h3>Poor Ann</h3><p>

    Tom Brokaw didn't ask about harsh negativity during a Tuesday
night interview with former Texas Gov. Ann Richards, who
"delivered that rollicking keynote speech against George Bush not
so long ago." Brokaw asked about strong women: "You paid the
price to some degree. You lost the governorship of Texas because
this country still is a little bit schizoid, isn't it, about the
role of women in American politics?" <p>


<h3>Brokaw: Right is Wrong</h3><p>

    Tom Brokaw was hit Tuesday with an anti-GOP comment he made
in San Diego. Freelance newsman Marc Morano showed him a quote,
cited in Media Reality Check '96, in which Brokaw asked rape
victim Jan Licence after her speech: "Do you think this is a
party that is dominated by men and this convention is dominated
by men as well...Do you think before tonight they thought very
much about what happens in America with rape?" <p>

    Brokaw read the quote, admitted "I did ask her that, which I
think is a fair question," then walked away. Earlier, Morano
asked why GOP delegates distrusted the media but Democrats don't.
Brokaw asserted that it's just because conservatives don't like
change: "I think a lot of reporters in fact, come from working
class, activist backgrounds. But I don't think that it really
colors the way that they report things and the conservatives
generally stand for the status quo and news is about change."<p>


<h3>Here's My Room Key!</h3><p>

    Great publicity isn't the only thing Bill Clinton picked up
on his train trip. Reporting on crowd reaction to Clinton's stop
at Michigan State University, NBC Nightly News on Wednesday found
one very giving student. Answering what she could give the
President, she yelled, "I'll give him my room key!" <p>


<h3>Used to Double Standard</h3><p>

    Reporters complained about the lack of hard news in San
Diego, but aren't doing so in Chicago. Radio host Don Imus asked
CBS's Bob Schieffer Wednesday morning why. Talk Daily reported
his response: "I guess we kind of got used to it."<p>

<a name="quote">QUOTE</a> OF THE DAY<p>

<i>"This has been a difficult couple of years for you. Did that
applause, the way you've been treated here, the way people have
been reacting to you, kind of make it all go away?" <p>
-- NBC's Maria Shriver in an exclusive interview with Hillary Clinton
after her August 27 speech </i>><p>

<center><h2><a name="networks">Networks</a> Concede It was a Liberal Night, But...
Hillary Asked to Respond to "Bitter Attacks"<p></center></h2>

    On Tuesday night the networks declared that speakers Mario
Cuomo, Jesse Jackson, and Hillary Clinton were liberals, but
instead of castigating Cuomo and Jackson for their negative
speeches, as they did with speakers in San Diego, they praised
their eloquence.  Like Monday night,
the Democrats again escaped any scrutiny of their intolerance on
abortion as the three broadcast networks each aired stories on
the disastrous impact of welfare reform.<p>

    -- Hillary portrayed as the victim of unwarranted Republican
attacks and given plenty of opportunities to fire back. Just
after she left the podium, NBC's Maria Shriver asked her nine
softball questions. See quote of the day below. For instance,
"You are credited with really redefining the role of First Lady
and for doing that, you've taken a lot of heat, a lot of
criticism. As you look back, do you wished you'd redefined it a
little less?" On CBS, Bob Schieffer asked her: "Weren't you a
little offended when he [Bob Dole] made the reference he did [to
your book]?" CNN's Wolf Blitzer inquired of her: "What goes
through your mind when you hear some of these bitter attacks
against you?"<p>

    -- The three big speakers were tagged liberal by all but CBS.
Peter Jennings called Cuomo and Jackson the "senior liberals in
the party," and ABC's Jeff Greenfield described Hillary Clinton's
speech as "liberalism lite." Tom Brokaw referred to Cuomo's
"traditional liberal litany." CNN's Bill Schneider noted Hillary
Clinton's "liberal policy agenda." Whitewater was mentioned twice
by NBC last night; CNN's Judy Woodruff mentioned it Monday night.<p>

    -- The wealth of Democratic delegates and the quota system
that selected them have gone unmentioned in prime time so far. A
graphic on last night's NBC Nightly News reported 35 percent earn
over $100,000. In San Diego, 38 percent fell in that category,
prompting CBS, CNN and NBC to ask if the GOP delegates were out
of touch. Some reporters have noted that Democrats are split
50-50 male-female, but none has wondered if the quota system
might contradict party rhetoric about opposing quotas.<p>

    -- Abortion, the focus of the networks in San Diego, has been
blown aside in Chicago. Kate Michelman, head of the National
Abortion Rights Action League and a supporter of partial birth
abortion, addressed the convention. But her early evening speech
failed to spur any talk about extremism. The Democrats at the
last minute also allowed pro-life Rep. Tony Hall to speak, but
that action didn't generate any media interest in why the
Democrats felt compelled to make the move. Abortion came up only
on CNN, but before prime time, as Judy Woodruff interviewed
former Pennsylvania Governor Robert Casey on the 7pm ET Inside
Politics.<p>

    -- Welfare reform reported from the viewpoint of potential
victims on ABC, CBS and NBC without any voices in favor of the
new law. <p>



<center><h2><a name="Kay">Slashing</a> Attacks on GOP Never Scorned As Negative
Reporters Swoon Over Cuomo, Jackson</center></h2><p>

    On Tuesday night in San Diego, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison and
Rep. Susan Molinari made jokey remarks about President Clinton
and were tagged as "attack dogs." Last night, Jesse Jackson
declared: "President Clinton has been our first line of defense
against the Newt Gingrich contract, America's right-wing assault
on our elderly, our students, and our civil rights." Mario Cuomo
announced: "The Republicans are the real threat. They are the
real threat to our women. They are the real threat to our
children. They are the real threat to clean air, clean water, and
the rich landscape of America...in the end, Bill Clinton spells
hope and Republicans spell disaster." Did the media see "slashing
partisan attacks"? Hardly. Note each network's contrast: <p>

    -- CNN's Ken Bode oozed: "Convention rhetoric has not been
much better than it was tonight, particularly with Jesse Jackson.
And of course, no one's going to forget for some time the First
Lady's speech, which was also terrific."  Farai Chideya gushed:
"Jesse Jackson's speech was extraordinary in its sense of hope,
purpose, and vision." Bob Franken asked Andrew Cuomo: "It was
quite a scene watching as they listened to the speech. You really
are a fan of his speaking style. It's amazing, isn't it?"
In San Diego, CNN's Judy Woodruff declared: "Well, they said it
was going to be a Clinton-bashing night at the Republican
convention, Bernie, and I think that is just what we heard from
Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison." Bernard Shaw replied: "And the
bashing will continue when the keynote speaker, Susan Molinari,
steps up there."<p>

    -- Last night, ABC's Peter Jennings asserted: "Just a little
earlier this evening going out of their way, the Democrats were,
to show they embrace the differences among them or between them,
they put forward to speak two of the senior liberals in the party
who did more than anything else on this day to energize this
crowd."<p>
    In San Diego, Jennings began: "Expect tonight to see very
much the attacks on President Clinton ratcheted up to a much
greater degree than they have been so far." Sam Donaldson added:
"Tonight, as you say, Peter, they are expecting red
meat...Tonight they want to hear President Clinton bashed." <p>

    -- Last night, Dan Rather suggested on CBS: "Mrs. Clinton
received a ringing defense during what was clearly the most
stirring speech of the convention so far." Bob Schieffer added:
"The man who made that speech was Jesse Jackson, who can make a
speech when he sets his mind to it. But his biggest applause line
came when he said that Democrats must set up a line of defense to
protect the old and the young from the Republican assault, and
then he said, and to set up a line of defense against their
vicious attacks on the First Lady. The place just went wild when
he said that."<p>
    In San Diego, Rather said Hutchison "is expected to hit
President Clinton rhetorically with everything short of a tire
tube." Schieffer asked the Senator: "I must say it's Attack Dog
Hutchison tonight. How do you feel in this new role?" <p>

    -- Last night, Tom Brokaw noted: "The old lion has not lost
its roar. There are very few speakers left in America who can
switch on a hall like Jesse Jackson. He has done it so many times
in the past. He began tonight in more muted tones, but of course,it's almost irresistible for him, and it grows out of a very deep
passion." Tim Russert added: "The crowd is letting loose a little
bit because the passion and the philosophy of Jesse Jackson is
something they very much ascribe to, and by him bridging the gap
and endorsing Bill Clinton so wholeheartedly, it's a plus for
Bill Clinton."<p>
    In San Diego, Brokaw told NBC viewers: "The party knows
better than anyone else it has to lower the threshhold of
perceived meanness on the part of the country." Russert
underlined the point: "Key words: mean-spirited and extremist.
They want to avoid those labels...I think the speech by Senator
Hutchison is dangerous, Tom, because she uses words that could be
interpreted by some people as mean."<p>



<center><h2><a name="most">"Most Economists"</a> Blame Spending, Not Tax Cuts for Deficit
New Survey Proves Dole Tax Cut News Wrong</center></h2><p>
    A just released survey of 700 economists found that "52
percent blame the growth of the federal deficit in the 1980s on
increased government spending more than on the Reagan tax cut,"
which was blamed by 48 percent. The fact that economists are
about evenly split contradicts many recent media reports.<p>

    "Most economists say the Reagan tax cuts did worsen the
budget deficit and many are skeptical of Dole's plan," announced
reporter David Bloom on the August 5 NBC Nightly News. Colleague
Mike Jensen insisted a few minutes later that "most analysts say
it's not good economics."<p>

    The next morning a headline over a Washington Post news story
declared: "Economists Question Dole's Plan." The headline over a
Boston Globe news story asserted: "Economists Cool to Dole's
Tax-Cut Plan: Candidate Speaks of Growth, but Analysts See No Big
Payoff."  <p>

    The poll of 700 members of the American Economics Association
discovered that 81 percent agreed that the Reagan tax cuts
increased economic growth. A plurality of 42 percent "want to see
the next Congress put a high priority on both restraining
government spending and cutting taxes," matching the Dole-Kemp
promise.<p>

    William Adams, a public administration professor at George
Washington University, directed the poll conducted August 19-21.
Though reported in this week's Weekly Standard and in Tuesday's
Washington Times, none of the above-mentioned outlets have yet
bothered to revise their claims.<p>


<center><h2><a name="voices">Voices</a> In Favor of Welfare Reform Vetoed by Networks
Welfare-State Television Sells the Liberal Line</center></h2><p>

    All three networks featured stories last night critical of
the new welfare reform law:<p>

    -- On NBC Nightly News, Tom Brokaw presented his view: "There
are serious questions about what happens to these people after
they're taken off the welfare rolls. Andrea Mitchell went to
Indiana to look at the conflict between fixing the system and
doing the right thing by people." Mitchell featured no welfare
reform proponents, just social workers, Jesse Jackson, and
impending victims: "Kimberly Gilbert will get benefits for two
years. After that, she's cut off, whether or not she finds a job.
That deadline is near for Charla Milton. Unable to find work, she
is terrified."<p>

    -- On ABC's World News Tonight, Peter Jennings suggested:
"Maybe if he is reelected, Mr. Clinton will do something to
reverse himself on welfare reform. Many of these delegates hope
so." Reporter Erin Hayes asked where the jobs would come from to
support welfare recipients: "An Urban League study found in
Chicago there are six times as many people who need work as there
are entry-level jobs available." Hayes aired no voices favoring
welfare reform, and concluded: "There is another concern as well:
the young children. When their mothers are made to go to work,
who will take care of them? Right now, no one really has an
answer. With so much still uncertain about welfare reform, it is
no wonder there is fear out there."<p>

    -- On the CBS Evening News, reporter Harry Smith also ignored
taxpayers and focused on victims: "We talked to four welfare moms
from across Chicago. They feel like they are this year's
political target...President Clinton seemed deaf to protests last
week when he signed the new welfare cuts into law. Cuts many
Americans support, but cuts these women think go too far." Smith
concluded: "Neighborhoods like Cabrini-Green have more than their
share of misery. Folks around here think misery is only going to
grow. Their long faith in the Democratic Party has been shaken,
and the actions of President Clinton confirm their fear that the
poor just do not count."<p>

<center><h2><a name="sidebites">SIDEBITES</center></h2><p>

<h3>Jack E. White Hot</h3><p>

    Time's Jack E. White exemplified the media's left-wing anger
against welfare reform in the September 2 issue: "Did anyone else
find it unnerving that only days before Bill Clinton signed a
welfare-reform law that will plunge more than a million children
into official poverty, he marked his 50th birthday with glitzy
celebrations in New York City that added $10 million to his
party's bulging campaign war chest? Shades of Marie Antoinette,
Newt Gingrich, and Jesse Helms." White complained: "As Jesse
Jackson has repeatedly and unavailingly pointed out, it makes
little sense to elect a Democrat if he governs like a
conservative Republican."<p>


<h3>Harshly Negative Attack</h3><p>

    In the same issue, Time columnist Margaret Carlson lit into 
the marriage of Bob and Elizabeth Dole: "Any time the Doles play
the family-values card, they are betting that divorce and
remarriage wipe the slate clean and stop the questions -- that
suddenly leaving your marriage and asking for an `emergency
divorce,' as Dole did from his first wife (when his daughter was
17), is morally equivalent if not superior to sticking out the
pain in your marriage and keeping a family together, as the
Clintons did...Now being divorced gives you a political pass, and
staying married gets you an inquisition."<p>


<h3>No Liberal Bias</h3><p>

    CBS News reporter Bob Schieffer told freelance newsman Marc
Morano in Chicago on Tuesday that the media don't tilt left: "I
think the media pretty well reflect American society. You know,
it's like when we had a draft army. You'd find one example of
everything there."<p>


<h3>Bayh vs. Molinari</h3><p>

    Tom Brokaw put GOP keynoter Susan Molinari on the defensive
when he interviewed her two weeks ago on the NBC Nightly News,
but last night he took a more deferential approach in
interviewing Democratic keynote speaker Gov. Evan Bayh.
Molinari faced seven straight questions about abortion and women:
"So they look at the platform. It's pretty rigid in its language
on abortion. Then people like Susan Molinari and Jack Kemp and
Bob Dole say don't pay attention to the platform, pay attention
to what we do."<p>

    Brokaw also pressed Bayh from the left, but only made him
answer one hostile question: "If there is a debate in the party
at the moment, it is about welfare reform. A lot of Democrats, in
Congress especially, think we have gone too far, too fast, that a
lot of children, more than a million, could be put below the
poverty line." <p>

    Unlike with Molinari, Brokaw played up Bayh's rising star
status: "When you walk out tonight to deliver that keynote
speech, all over this hall and in the television booths and in
the print section, people are going to be saying `Evan Bayh,
future candidate for President of the United States. This is a
big moment for him.' You can't completely erase that from your
thinking?"<p>


<h3>Calling J.C. Watts</h3><p>

    Two weeks ago, ABC, CBS, and NBC carried none of Rep. J.C.
Watts' speech, which occurred during their live 10pm ET hour,
though GOP delegates loved it. Last night, ABC ran excerpts of
the pre-10pm ET addresses of Jesse Jackson and Mario Cuomo (and
on Nightline). CBS showed some Jackson clips.<p>

<center><h2><a name="quote">QUOTE</a> OF THE DAY</center></h2><p>

<i>"We were just reminded in that moving film that we saw here of
your lifelong work as an advocate for children's causes. And yet,
late last week, your husband signed a welfare reform bill that as
you know, Senator Patrick Moynihan and other welfare experts are
saying is going to throw a million children into poverty. Does
that legislation threaten to undo so much of what you've worked
for over the years?"<p>
-- CNN's Judy Woodruff to Hillary Clinton,
August 26 interview</i><p> 

<center><h2><a name="Another">Another</a> Day of Questions from the Left
Liberal Delegates, But Party's Too Conservative</center></h2><p>

    Viewers of last night's network coverage could have learned
how Democratic delegates are outside the mainstream, but they
heard nothing about controversies like abortion, as the networks
again worried Clinton had gone too far right.<p>

    -- CBS and CNN attempted to make Hillary Clinton the martyr
of harsh San Diego attacks and ask her welfare questions from the
left. <p>

    -- Network reporters worried that the party has become too
conservative as they grilled Democrats for not opposing the
welfare reform bill. <p>

    -- ABC, CNN and PBS mentioned the liberal nature of the
delegates at least once, but not NBC or CBS in prime time. "We
know from our survey that these delgates are far to the left of
the mainstream just as the Republicans were to the right of the
mainstream," ABC's Sam Donaldson declared last night. Unions also
got brief attention. Tom Brokaw referred to "a very unusually
high representation of labor down on the floor" and on CBS Dan
Rather also noted the labor angle.<p>

    -- Three networks mentioned tobacco funding of the
convention, but none noted the hypocrisy of Democrats taking
money from an industry they rail against. On CNN in prime time
Bill Schneider explained that the NRA and tobacco lobby are the
"least popular" special interests "and those are the two that the
Democrats are going to try to showcase as linked to the
Republican Party." On World News Tonight yesterday ABC's intrepid
Brian Ross cited a brunch cruise for delegates "put on by the
Brown and Williamson tobacco company" and how "Philip Morris has
the most extensive operation with the same group of back room
operatives who ran things in San Diego." NBC's Tom Brokaw
referred to a tobacco-sponsored event where delegates wore "Keep
the FDA off the farm" buttons. <p>

    -- Only two reporters questioned the authenticity of
Democratic claims to moderation. During the PBS-NBC joint
broadcast, Lisa Myers asked a delegate: "You have a President who
talks like a Republican, you have a platform that is so centrist
that some critics say it's a con job. Is this essentially,
though, a liberal party?" CNN's Judy Woodruff asked Bob Kerrey if
Clinton will go left after the election.<p>

    After scant attention Sunday, Democratic suppression of
abortion debate fell completely off TV screens.<P255D> In all of
Monday's prime time coverage no reporter or anchor raised the
topic, though Bob Casey, the pro-life former Governor of
Pennsylvania, gave a speech at another Chicago location on the
party's intolerance. <p>

<center><h2><a name="poor">CNN, CBS Ask First Lady About Harsh GOP Attacks, Welfare:
Poor Hillary, Wondering If It's Worth It</a></center></h2><p>

   In 1992, then-PBS anchor Judy Woodruff gave a soft convention
interview to Hillary Clinton in July, but blistered Barbara Bush
in August in Houston with a welter of accusatory questions about
the inappropriateness of Bush campaign tactics. On last night's
Inside Politics on CNN, Woodruff devoted her interview to
eliciting Hillary Clinton's responses to Republican attacks:<p>

    -- "Let me take you back to San Diego. Bob Dole said it
doesn't take a village, a collective, the state, which he said
has made mistakes in raising children, it takes a family. Is this
something that is going to become a major issue in this fall
campaign?"<p>

    -- "Also in San Diego, former president George Bush told the
delegates he `worked hard,' I'm quoting here, `to uphold the
dignity and the honor of the presidency, to treat it with
respect. And then he added, quote, `it breaks his heart, when the
White House is demeaned, the presidency diminished.' Does that
hurt coming from your immediate predecessor?"<p>

    -- "He then went on, Mrs. Clinton, he made a point of saying
that his wife, Mrs. Bush, quote, `unquestionably upheld the honor
of the White House.' Is that an insult to you?"<p>

    -- When Mrs. Clinton failed to answer sharply enough,
Woodruff insisted: "But he was clearly drawing a contrast
there...you're not hurt?"<p>

    Stories of Mrs. Clinton's rough-house approach to politics,
such as her reported role in firing and lodging criminal
accusations against seven workers of the White House Travel
Office, did not prevent CBS This Morning co-host Jose Diaz-Balart
from also presenting the First Lady as the beleaguered martyr of
unfortunate Republican attacks: <p>

    -- "In the San Diego Republican convention, you were the
subject of much conversation, and I think the target, I think
many would say, of some very serious attacks."<p>
 "Do you ever, seriously, in the White
House, when all the doors are closed, do you ever say `Is this
worth it'?"<p>

    Diaz-Balart also asked the First Lady two welfare questions
from the left: <p>

    -- "One thing you care very deeply about is children, and
even your supporters that work for children's rights have
criticized President Clinton's decision to okay the welfare
reform bill. What were your conversations with him when he was in
that period of really making a determination?"<p>

    -- "What would you say to the people in the Children's
Defense Fund [the liberal group she used to chair] who have
criticized it? What is your response to them?"<p>

    Woodruff also peppered the First Lady with welfare reform
questions, all six of them from the left. Here are three, another
is the quote of the day.<p>

    -- "Your close friend, Marian Wright Edelman of the
Children's Defense Fund, said the President's signing and this is
a quote, 'makes a mockery of his pledge not to hurt children,'
she said, 'it will leave a moral blot on his presidency and the
country that will never be forgotten.'"<p>

    -- "But if the bill is so flawed, why sign it? Why not work
to fix it, and sign it later?"<p>

    -- "Eleanor Roosevelt, whom you admire, mentioned her again
just now, said that much of the time she kept her disagreements
with the President to herself in private, but there were times
that she felt it was important to disagree publicly. Does there
ever come a time with you, and if not welfare reform, then what?" <p>


<center><h2><a name="networks">Democrats and Clinton Have Gone Too Far to the Right?
Networks Worry Democrats Not Liberal Enough</a></center></h2><p>

    Last night network correspondents worried how wise it has
been for Bill Clinton and the Democratic Party to have moved to
the right and, in so doing, abandoned their liberal princples.
Tom Brokaw placed the party, which fought Republican efforts to
slow the rate of growth of government, to the right of center.<p>

    -- During PBS-NBC coverage, Margaret Warner asked Andrew
Kohut of the Pew Research Center: "Does the President pay any
political price for turning his back on traditional liberalism,
that is, among enthusiasm among traditional Democrats?"<p>

    -- Later during NBC's solo time, Tom Brokaw interviewed VP Al
Gore and then observed to NBC's Tim Russert: "The Vice President
was saying no no no, this is not forced on us by the Republicans,
we really always had this kind of thing in mind in the first
place. But since 1994 they have slid across the political
spectrum to really right of center. And they've got a guy by the
name of Dick Morris who's advising them on a daily basis how to
be more pragmatic."<p>

    -- On CBS, Dan Rather asked Jesse Jackson: "Bill Clinton's
been running pretty hard to the right, so far that some Democrats
now call him a `Republicrat.' Do you go that far?" <p>

    -- Talking to Tom Hayden, Ed Bradley of CBS wondered:
"Senator Hayden, there are people who say the Democratic Party
has become very pragmatic in an effort to win this election,
they've given up their principles. Your response to that?" <p>


<center><h2><a name="For">For</a> Second Day, Focus is on Evils of Welfare Reform
"Slightly Terrified" of New Democrat Promises</h2></center><p>

    Just as on Sunday, last night the networks repeatedly pressed
Democrats from the left on Bill Clinton's signing of the welfare
reform bill. A PBS reporter wondered if it meant the dismantling
of the "safety net that took so long to put together."<p>

    -- CNN's Wolf Blitzer asked Illinois Senator Carol
Moseley-Braun: "How does it feel, tell us, you voted against the
welfare reform bill, you're now obviously very supportive of the
President, tell us do you feel that he sort of betrayed some of
those values that you expressed. How can you go forward now and
support him after his decision to sign that welfare reform bill
into law?"<p>

    -- HHS Secretary Donna Shalala got it from the left during
PBS-NBC coverage as Tom Brokaw inquired: "If you were a poor
single mother in a poor rural state in America, without many
resources, and you wanted to go to work, you want to do all the
right things, but there aren't many jobs for people who have real
skills, wouldn't you be slightly terrified looking into the next
two years?"<p>

    -- Earlier in the evening, Elizabeth Farnesworth of PBS
grilled White House Deputy Chief of Staff Harold Ickes: "We're
looking tonight at this whole question of who the Democrats are.
Did the President turn his back on fundamental Democratic
principles when he signed the welfare bill?" She also forwarded a
liberal argument: "Does it worry you that the welfare, signing
the welfare bill is unraveling the safety net that took so long
to put together?"<p>

    -- ABC's Jeff Greenfield highlighted bewilderment in network
ranks about the acceptance of Clinton's retreat from liberalism
on the issue. Interviewing Congressman Charles Rangel, he asked:
"Congressman it used to be said that when the Democrats make a
firing squad they form a circle, they love to rebel against an
incumbent President, and you have the welfare bill and the move
to the center. You're from one of the most liberal cities in the
country, why is the dog not barking in the night? Why are you
staying with the President given that discontent?" <p>

<center><h2><a name="sidebites">SIDEBITES</a></h2></center><p>

<h3>Harsh or Enthusiastic?</h3><p>

    Bill Clinton and Bob Dole attacked each other on Sunday, but
for CBS This Morning, only Bob Dole was harsh. Sandra Hughes
reported Monday: "Dole's big moment yesterday came when he
stormed Chicago, and launch-ed a harsh attack against the man of
the hour there, Bill Clinton." <p>

    But a few minutes earlier Bill Plante reviewed Clinton's
train trip, admiringly noting that "at each whistle stop Mr.
Clinton threw himself enthusiastically into campaign mode,
leaning deep into every crowd and lacing his remarks with
partisan fire." <p>

    So are the Democratic candidates avoiding harsh personal
attacks? On Good Morning America co-host Charlie Gibson asked
Senator Christopher Dodd: "You said the other day that `I got the
word out,' that I don't want to hear personal attacks against the
Republicans at this convention. Yesterday on his train trip the
President accused Republicans of blackmail to get their budget.
Al Gore, yesterday, accused the Republicans of ignorance and
audacity, talked about the two-headed monster of Dole and
Gingrich. Dick Gephardt, the leader of the House, of the
Democrats, talked about Republican extremism, said they're
radicals. Talk about getting the word out?"<p>


<h3>Gumbel's Gripe</h3><p>

    Monday Bryant Gumbel couldn't stop from taking one more shot
at Republicans for an image he helped create. Interviewing
Chicago Mayor Richard Daley on Today, he queried: "The
Republicans, as you know, took a lot of criticism for the
scripting of their convention and for presenting an image that
was contrary to their platform. How do you figure this convention
is going to be different?"<p>
<h3>Ignoring Casey's Case</h3><p>

    Former Pennsylvania Gov. Bob Casey, banned from the
Democratic convention podium for the second party gathering in a
row, gave an impassioned pro-life speech yesterday at Chicago's
Fischer Center. Despite a reported heavy media presence at his
speech (which he wanted to make at the convention), none of the
networks aired the Casey speech story on last night's evening
news shows. <p>

    In his new book Fighting For Life, Casey remembered the 1992
platform hearings: "There were many Democrats, I said, who
opposed our party's embrace of the radical pro-abortion lobby.
Often it seemed the Democratic National Committee had become
little more than an auxiliary of NARAL -- the National Abortion
Rights Action League."<p>

    On Monday's Nightline, ABC's Chris Bury gave Casey 15 seconds
of fame: "The Democrats in Chicago, like the Republicans in San
Diego, have tried to script any spontaneity right out of the
program. Pennsylvania Governor Robert Casey, whose strong
anti-abortion views defy the party's position, had to find
cameras outside the convention hall."<p>


<h3>At Hillary's Side</h3><p>

    As a CBS camera panned the United Center last night it came
upon a man standing beside Hillary Rodham Clinton. Dan Rather
identified him: "The gentleman in the dark suit to the right of
the frame, who was just framed out, Les Moonves of CBS. And the
chant takes up `four more years.' The lady, the First Lady from
Chicago with the smashing smile, is age 48. She and President
Clinton have been married for 20 years." Moonves's job with CBS?
President of the entertainment division.<p>

<center><h2><a name="quote">QUOTE OF THE DAY</a></center></h2><p>

<i>"You said this morning that the party's message will focus on the
needs and cares of the people. Now, how do you reconcile that
with a President who has just signed a quote 'welfare reform
bill' which by general agreement is going to put a lot of poor
children on the street?"<p>
-- Dan Rather to Chris Dodd during an
interview on the August 25 CBS Evening News</i><p>


<center><h2><a name="Weekend">Weekend</a> Shows Fail to Apply GOP Level of Scrutiny
Democrats Not Portrayed as Intolerant, Extreme</h2></center><p>

    Unlike Republicans two Sundays ago, Democrats yesterday did
not come under assault from the networks over their intolerance
on abortion. While the subject was raised a few times, the
networks spent more time raising liberal criticisms of the
welfare reform bill President Clinton just signed. Findings from
weekend coverage:<p>

    -- Democrats faced about one-third as many questions about
abortion and the exclusion of dissenting speakers. Two weeks ago,
the Sunday morning shows asked 27 questions about the GOP split
on abortion and the failure to allow Gov. Pete Wilson to speak.
Interviewers asked only 10 questions yesterday, perhaps because
unlike inviting pro-choice Wilson and pro-life Bay Buchanan weeks
before, pro-life Democrats like Gov. Bob Casey were not booked,
despite Casey's Friday Wall Street Journal op-ed attacking the
"intolerance" of a "gag rule party." CNN's Late Edition asked
only two questions, compared to 11 posed to the GOP; NBC's Meet
the Press asked six questions, compared to nine for the GOP.
ABC's This Week with David Brinkley had two questions instead of
four, and CBS's Face the Nation offered zero abortion questions,
compared to three in San Diego.<p>
 
    -- No mention of corporate contributions to the Democratic
convention, not even of the hypocrisy of accepting funds from
tobacco companies while Clinton attacks them with rhetoric and
new regulations. Two weeks ago on Meet the Press, David Broder
twice asked RNC Chairman Haley Barbour about the hypocrisy of
accepting corporate money for the convention while promising
campaign finance reform. On the Friday, August 23 World News
Tonight, however, ABC's Brian Ross did do a story on the top ten
corporate contributors to the DNC, including "a labor union under
federal investigation for its ties to the mafia."<p>

    -- No questions were posed about how unions have taken over
the Democratic Party. A Washington Post survey of Democratic
delegates found 34 percent belong to a union. Friday's Wall
Street Journal noted that "more than 400 delegates -- roughly one
in ten -- will be members of the National Education Association."
But that failed to generate questions about who controls the
party. <p>

    Only 21 percent of GOP delegates said they were part of the
religious right, but in San Diego CBS worried about their having
too much influence. On Sunday August 11, Face the Nation guests
got five ominous questions. "There are a number of Republicans
who are very uncomfortable with what they feel is the power, the
control that the conservative religious right has. Are you
concerned about that?" CBS reporter Phil Jones asked Texas
Governor George W. Bush.<p>

    -- Democrats called too conservative, charged from the left
with going too far on welfare reform.



<center><h2><a name="Just">Just</a> as in San Diego, Networks Attack from the Left
Network Stars Line Up for Welfare Status Quo</center></h2><p>

    The networks came at Republicans from the left on abortion in
San Diego, and on Sunday they also came at Democrats from the
left. By concentrating on liberal complaints about welfare
reform, reporters helped Bill Clinton's effort to portray himself
as a centrist. Dan Rather wondered if the party had gone "too far
to the right?"<p>

    -- Al Hunt of the Wall Street Journal set the tone of liberal
anger on Saturday night's CNN Capital Gang: "Jesse Jackson and a
few others will complain and I think a majority of the delegates
here privately agree with Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan that
supporters of this bill, quote, 'will take this disgrace to their
graves,' end quote. They know Bill Clinton put his own political
interests ahead of the well being of little children." <p>

    --  Meet the Press moderator Tim Russert demanded of DNC
General Chairman Chris Dodd: "It's an issue of morality to many
people, and how can you defend a President who basically said to
the Congressional Democrats: Listen, that's your view, but I'm
doing this, because -- was it politically expedient?"<p>

    -- Talking with Democratic strategist James Carville later in
the show, Russert reminded viewers that he once toiled for former
New York Governor Mario Cuomo: "But the Democratic Party for
sixty years, James Carville, fought for a minimum guarantee
payment to poor children and Bill Clinton undid that. Don't you
have to draw the line someplace and say 'I'm a Democrat and this
is what I stand for'?"<p>

    -- On yesterday's Face the Nation, CBS reporter Rita Braver
asked Chicago Mayor Richard Daley: "The party looks a lot more
united right now. But we have a sense that there are some
underlying divisions and particularly this week with the
President signing a welfare bill that a lot of people think is
going to put children into poverty. And I guess the question is
that in a city like this, aren't you scared about what is going
to happen? Aren't you afraid you are going to have a lot of
hungry children?"<p>

    -- Minutes later while interviewing Indiana Governor Evan
Bayh, Braver pictured the Democrats as being too conservative: "I
just wondered what you think is the really big difference between
the Democrats and Republicans in this election? What would make
people go Democrat when it seems like the Democrats are moving so
close to Republican positions?"<p>

    --  Last night Dan Rather joined the chorus, inquiring of
Braver on the CBS Evening News: "Rita, how worried are the
Democrats about protests from some here that the party is running
too far to the right, particularly on welfare reform?"  <p>

<center><h2><a name="Benchmarks">Benchmarks for the Week to Come:</a>
A Look Back at San Diego</center></h2><p>

    Before the networks begin their prime time coverage in
Chicago, here's a brief summary of how they covered the
Republican convention in San Diego. <p>

    -- Labeling. Republican delegates, speakers, and candidates
were described as conservative more than three times as often as
moderate, but reporters also used more extreme labels than
moderate labels. The networks employed 46 conservative labels
(including 16 references to extreme conservatism) to only 13
moderate labels.<p>

    -- Agenda of Questions. Reporters posed more than seven times
as many questions from the liberal agenda as they did from a
conservative agenda: 51 questions from the left, compared to only
six questions from the right.<p>

    -- Controversies. Reporters referred to the Republican
Party's split on the abortion issue, including Gov. Pete Wilson's
"disinvitation" to speak, on 55 occasions in prime time. In 1992,
the Democrats' spiking of Gov. Bob Casey surfaced only six times
(once on NBC, five times on CNN). ABC and CBS never acknowledged
the Casey flap.<p>


<center><h2><a name="Sidebites">SIDEBITES</a></center></h2><p>

<h3>Unpopular Koppel</h3><p>

Most people think Ted Koppel was wrong to leave the Republican
convention early, a Fox News/Opinion Dynamics poll found. On
yesterday's Fox News Sunday, host Tony Snow reported that when
asked if Koppel was "justified in leaving," 52 percent said no,
31 percent responded yes and 16 percent were undecided. On
Tuesday of the GOP gathering, Koppel announced Nightline would
leave because "this convention is more infomercial than a news
event." <p>


<h3>Moderate" Democrats?</h3><p>

"Return to Chicago: This Time, the Democrats Embrace Moderation"
declared the headline on the front of the Sunday Washington
Post's convention section. Four pages later the Post headline
over a story on a survey of delegates read: "Delegates Leaning
More Liberal Than Their Leader or the Rank and File." Indeed, 82
percent favor affirmative action, 65 percent are against a
balanced budget amendment, 72 percent oppose "reducing spending
on social programs," but 65 percent want less defense spending.<p>


<h3>Hillary the Revolutionary</h3><p>

Sam Donaldson identified Hillary Clinton's problem on yesterday's
This Week with David Brinkley: "I think much of the opposition to
Hillary Rodham Clinton is the fact that she is a strong-willed
woman doing things in a man's arena, and we men don't seem to
like that." <p>
After George Will pointed out that politics is the arena of many
women, from Margaret Thatcher to Indira Gandhi, Cokie Roberts
retorted that she's been an "agent of change" and "it's very
difficult for the world to accept people who have been
revolutionaries."<p>

    <h2><center>Three items today:<p></center></h2>

1) The Republican Party has been "captured by the extremists" and
"Don't you get mad" when the First Lady is criticized, just two
of Dan Rather's statements and questions to Bill Clinton for 60
Minutes on Sunday night.<p>
2) For a former Washington Post reporter the Republican
convention reminded her of slaughtered Indians and of Reagan's
mean policies.<p>
3) Just about everyone in Hollywood showed up at or served as
host for President Clinton's 50th birthday bash Sunday night. One
major celebrity shouted that "Dole sucks!"<p>

 1) Sunday afternoon Dan Rather interviewed President Clinton
for that night's 60 Minutes. Dan Rather started out by asking:
"Some of your staff members, not by name, have been saying, 'yes
the President thinks Bob Dole is a nice person and has been a
pretty good leader in some ways, but, say they, he's been
captured by the extremists in the Republican Party, the radical
part of the Republican Party, including Newt Gingrich. Is that
what you think?"<p>

    Rather showed Clinton video of criticisms from Bob Dole and
Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison at the Republican convention. Almost
apologetic, Rather noted, "You said your hope is it can be fought
out on the issues, but one more thing from the convention, then
I'll give you a chance to respond to it. As you must know,
whether you watched the convention or not, the Republicans fired
a number of shots at the First Lady. Some samples. Former
President Bush said, quote, 'Mrs. Bush upheld the honor of the
White House, and did it with class and style and caring and
love.'....I don't know of anyone in the convention who didn't
take that as a difference of the present First Lady and the
former First Lady."<p>
    
    After Clinton responded, Rather implored: "Don't you get mad,
Mr. President, when this sort of thing happens?"<p>

     2) And before you forget the media's animosity toward the
Republican convention, here's a portion of a commentary piece in
Friday's USA Today by Jill Nelson, a former Washington Post
reporter: <p>
    "I found it hard not to cringe. I was embarrassed by the
specter of everyone's favorite black man, Colin Powell, lecturing
us on why he became a Republican and referring to a  divine
providence that gave us this land.' Tell that to the Native
Americans who were slaughtered in the name of 'divine
providence.' I felt manipulated, not moved, by Nancy Reagan's
tribute to her Ronnie as some sort of caring everyman,
considering that under Reagan the rich got richer, the national
debt skyrocketed, and working Americans were left holding the
bag."<p>

    3 ) Sunday night the Democratic Party held a series of
birthday parties in New York City and around the country for
President Clinton. The Washington Post's Lloyd Grove reported
Monday that in addition to emcee Whoopi Goldberg that attending
celebrities included Tony Bennett, Carly Simon, Jon Bon Jovi,
Aretha Franklin, and James Earl Jones. <p>

    Monday's New York Post added these names to the celebrity
list: Leslie Nielsen, Tim Conway, Ted Danson and Mary
Steenburgen. The New York Post's Cindy Adams reported: "The party
was beamed around the country by satellite so other celebs could
get a chance to host a shindig of their very own: In L.A.,
Nicolas Cage and his wife, Patricia Arquette, played host. In San
Francisco it was Michael Keaton, who has never, ever done
anything political before. In Baltimore, it was Valerie Harper;
in Boston, Judy Collins; in Nashville, L.L. Cool J; in Denver,
C.C. Wayans...."<p>
 
    The Washington Post's Grove relayed that at one of the NYC
bashes, "Comedian and morning television host Rosie O'Donnell
entertained the crowd by shouting, 'Dole sucks!'"<p>

    A very inclusionary and tolerant message. -- Brent Baker.<p>

<i>"Just how tightly scripted is this convention? Well, a Russian 
television reporter said today that this is as tightly controlled 
as anything the Communist Party ever put on, Tom." <p>
-- Reporter 
David Bloom from the convention floor to anchor Tom Brokaw, 
August 14 NBC Nightly News.</i><p>
<center><h2><a name="finally">Finally Find a Republican They Like, But Still Attack 
Rest Elizabeth Dole: "Masterful"</h2></center><p>

It took until the third night, but Wednesday evening the networks 
finally found a Republican they could respect: Elizabeth Dole. 
However, they still spent yesterday morning and evening 
disparaging speakers who had criticized President Clinton and 
questioning the credibility of Jack Kemp for changing his 
position on affirmative action and immigration.<p>

"Absolutely powerful performance," gushed Dan Rather after 
Elizabeth Dole finished her reflections on Bob Doles life. "It 
was masterful," agreed Tim Russert on NBC where Tom Brokaw 
explained: "In the language of this summer, ladies and gentlemen, 
that was a gold medal performance." ABCs Peter Jennings 
pronounced it "an unquestionably brilliant piece of stagecraft by 
Mrs. Dole."<p>

Yesterday, network viewers also heard:<p>

Jack Kemp has "damaged his credibility" by altering his positions 
on affirmative action and immigration. Lesley Stahl asked if he's 
selling his soul to be loyal to Bob Dole?" ABC suggested it 
fights the very image that hes built for himself as an 
independent thinker." Kemp adjusted two views, all of Clintons 
are usually in constant motion. Will networks focus on that in 
Chicago? <p>

Networks come to Clintons defense and say Tuesday night speakers 
went too far in their harsh criticism of Clinton. CBS insisted 
Susan Molinari went after Clinton "with a vengeance" and Good 
Morning America's Elizabeth Vargas claimed "some of the harshest 
words were from Texas Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison." Bryant 
Gumbel wondered if anyone is "seeing any evidence" of tolerance 
from Republicans. And NBCs Maria Shriver asked "how ugly" 
Republicans will make the fall campaign. <p>

Reporters may like Elizabeth Dole, but they still hold a grudge 
against Marilyn Quayle. ABCs Michel McQueen recalled the 
"strident tone" of her 1992 convention address as NBCs Tom 
Brokaw also charged last night that Mrs. Quayle was "too 
strident." <p>

<center><h2><a name="gop">GOP</a> Criticized for Attacking Clinton*s "Eating Habits";
Decrying "Bash Bill Night"</h2></center><p>
Journalistic sensitivity to any attacks on Bill Clinton quickly came through loud and clear Wednesday morning and night. "GOP Unleashes An Attack On Clinton Over Character and His Economic Policies," charged The New York Times.<p>

"Congresswoman Susan Molinari took on the role of attack dog last night, using her keynote address to attack the President," Bryant Gumbel began Wednesday's Today.<p>

NBC*s morning crew stuck to the Democratic line in their questions. Gumbel asked Tim Russert: "There's an old adage that says what you do speaks so loudly I can't hear what you say. Republicans are speaking tolerance and diversity. Are you seeing any evidence of it or quite the contrary?"<p>

Today's Katie Couric inquired of Republican Charles Black: "Chris Dodd of the DNC says this is a huge con game. That the way you're portraying the party as this moderate inclusive party just doesn't gibe with say, the platform, and some of the attitudes of members of the GOP. How do you address that?" Couric asked Pat Buchanan: "Your speech at the 1992 Republican convention, where you talked about a religious war, was considered by many to be very polarizing, a real turn-off, self-righteous, superior, exclusionary. Do you regret giving this speech?"<p>

CBS This Morning co-host Jane Robelot declared: "It was unofficially Bash Bill Night last night in San Diego...Speaker after Republican speaker went after the man with a vengeance, including the keynoter, Susan Molinari."<p>

Over on Good Morning America, news anchor Elizabeth Vargas asserted: "Some of the harshest words were from Texas Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, who tried to paint the President as a tax and spend liberal." GMA co-host Charles Gibson added: "Polls will tell you these days that people do not want much partisanship in their politics, but they got it at the Republican convention last night. There were attacks on President Clinton's credibility, integrity, even his eating habits." ABC's Vargas didn't shy away from stereotyping: "But in addition to a gender gap, Republicans have had problems attacting minorities, a party that has traditionally been home to the angry white man."<p>

Last night NBC*s Lisa Myers demanded of Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison: "Some of the focus groups which had watched your speech...voters found it too negative. They didn't particularly like the degree to which you attacked the President. In retrospect do you think you went too far?"<p>

Calling conservatives "extremists" has been a Democratic mantra for two years, but NBC*s Maria Shriver asked Dole California campaign chairman Ken Khachigian: "You said coming out of this campaign, Clinton is going to have 80 days of hell, that we are going to take Clinton down in California, that we are going to take him down hard. How ugly is this going to get?" No uglier than the media in San Diego.<p>

<center><h2><a name="clinton">Will</a> Clinton Be Held to the Same Standard in Chicago?</h2>
<h3>Jack Kemp, the Political "Acrobat"</h3></center><p>

The choice of Jack Kemp as Dole's running mate prompted the media to point out Kemp's "independent thinking," his differences with Dole on issues like affirmative action and immigration. Now that Kemp has modified those two views to reflect the party's platform, the media are accusing him of abandoning principle.<p>

While reporters portray President Clinton's flip-flops on every issue as "moving to the center," they don't see moves from Dole and Kemp in quite the same light. On Wednesday's CBS Evening News, anchor Dan Rather quipped: "Bob Dole has reversed himself on deficit reduction versus tax cuts. Jack Kemp has reversed himself on how he feels about immigration. Isn't that, or is it, going to make it more difficult to 
attack Bill Clinton on the character issue?" Questioning Vin Weber, co-chairman of the Dole campaign, in prime time last night CBS's Lesley Stahl asked: "Your longtime friend Jack Kemp has changed his long-held views, in the last two days, on affirmative action, on immigration policy. Is he selling his soul to be loyal to Bob Dole?"<p>

Interviewing Dan Quayle, NBC's Maria Shriver kept up the same line: "Let's talk about Jack Kemp [for] a minute. Today he reversed his position on immigration. Now in favor of expelling children of illegal immigrants from schools. How much does that damage his credibility?"<p>

On World News Tonight ABC's Jackie Judd asserted that "The quarterback became the acrobat today. Kemp was flip-flopping on long held positions." She then looked at his affirmative action change, noting "that left at least one delegate here feeling abandoned." She concluded: "Kemp's change in position on these core issues fights the very image that he's built for himself as an independent thinker."<p>

<h3>Koppel Cops Out of San Diego</h3></center>

Ted Koppel is angry. As quoted by Martha Moore in the August 14 USA Today, he complained that convention planners always exert as much control over coverage as possible, but this year, "`I think the politicians are ahead,'" says ABC's Ted Koppel, who took his Nightline show back to Washington today, two days early. `They have more control over what we put on the air this week than they have ever had before.'"<p>

Just how successful have planners been? According to USA Today ABC filled a bit over half of their broadcast on Monday, 34 minutes out of an hour, with actual convention proceedings. On Tuesday, ABC aired even less of the convention, 26 out of 66 minutes broadcast. ABC filled the rest with interviews, analysis and ads.<p>

Koppel sounded like a restless child in his Tuesday Nightline announcement: "This convention is more of an infomercial than a news event. Nothing surprising has happened, nothing surprising is anticipated. Frankly, we expect the Democratic convention in Chicago to be much of the same. Indeed the only reason we were planning to originate these Nightline broadcasts from Chicago in another couple of week was a sense of fairness. And then it occurred to us that perhaps we should learn from our experience. There was a time when the national political conventions were news events of such complexity that they required the presence of thousands of journalists , but not this year. If anything important happens we will certainly have an adequate staff here to cover it and we will send an equivalent unit to Chicago. But we don*t all have to be here so most of us from Nightline are going home tomorrow."<p>

Such is the sad state of American journalism: Koppel's Nightline broadcast five stories about Tonya Harding in 1994, many more about O.J. Simpson, but will only turn in two on the 1996 Republican convention."<p>

Reporters couldn't help but praise Elizabeth Dole, but Marilyn Quayle 
still hasn't lived down the media's feminist fury over her 1992 convention 
speech. On Tuesday night, ABC's Michel McQueen said: "I ran into Marilyn 
Quayle today, who gave a speech in 1992 that was kind of a 'peel the 
paint off the walls' speech that was described later on as contributing 
to a rather strident tone of the '92 convention. She told me she was 
shocked by the way it was received afterwards."<p>

After Dan Quayle's speech last night, NBC's Tom Brokaw recalled: "Marilyn 
Quayle, who spoke at the convention four years ago, and many people 
thought that her speech was too strident, talking about the place 
of women, critical of the feminist movement in this country at the 
time."<p>



<center><h2><a name="rapping">Rapping</a> Reagan's Film</h2></center>
<p>
Remember Bill Clinton's "Man From Hope" video during the 1992 Democratic convention? The sugary-sweet film was shown on all the networks and was widely praised for adding insight into Bill Clinton. But the Republican*s equally sweet video of President Ronald Reagan on Tuesday night touched off a round of media carping as to the video*s value as news.
<p>
As James Bennet reported in Wednesday*s New York Times, Jeff Zucker, Executive Producer of NBC coverage, said: "Let me say if I had to do it again, I would really give that a second thought...I*m not as convinced, Monday morning quarterbacking myself, that it was as newsworthy as I thought going in."
<p>
CBS officials clucked about their decision to pass over the video, hoping for more of a movie of the week flavor. "Lane Venardos, a CBS vice president, sounded equally comfortable with his decision to ignore the film almost completely. "We decided on news value alone not to run it," he said. "There was not one scintilla of new information." Mr. Venardos said convention planners had promised the video would include "new pictures of the former President, never-before-seen post-Alzheimer's-onset pictures."
<p>
<h3>Clinton: Fiscal Conservative</h3>
<p>
In the August 19 edition, Newsweek's six-million-dollar "anonymous" author, Joe Klein, declared the GOP faithful "entered their convention on a mild, quasi-delusional wave of enthusiasm. The rest of us will be forgiven for yawning: the Dole tax cut stands, to all but hard-core taxophobes, as a transparent and rather pathetic bit of politics. He wants to cut $548 billion over six years? And balance the budget? Does anyone actually believe this? The trouble is, after all the deficit reduction of the past few years, there isn*t much non-incendiary matter left on the federal level to cut."
<p>
Time's George Church sneered: "Getting people not to think might be helpful, particularly since some of Dole's numbers do not seem to add up." Church concluded: "A case could be made that the candidate who best represents the fiscally conservative, moderate Republican tradition is, believe it or not, Bill Clinton."
<p>
<h3>Candace Capitalizes</h3>
<p>
On Wednesday's Today, NBC's Jamie Gangel did a feature on  Candace Gingrich which painted a very unsympathetic portrait of the lesbian*s half-brother Newt: "Gingrich went on to call Candace a sinner. He's also compared homosexuality to alcoholism and is against legislation that would protect gays from being fired because of their sexual orientation." 
<p>
Gangel said to Candace: "You're being very polite about the fact that your brother says terrible things about homosexuals....He doesn't return your phone calls. He doesn't answer your faxes. He doesn't respond to his own sister. That's okay with you?"
<p>
Gangel never attempted to understand how the Speaker might feel: that Candace has capitalized on her half-brother's fame (complete with a guest star appearance on Friends by making him look insensitive, and that replying to any call or fax might lead to another batch of negative publicity.
Gangel simply claimed: "Candace says she is not trying to hurt her brother. She just wants equal rights and hopes people will learn to accept gay relationships."
<p>
<h3>Kemp's flip flops.</h3>
<p>
	When Bob Dole announced his choice of Jack Kemp as his running mate, the media quickly pointed out Kemp's "independent thinking," his differences with Dole on issues like affirmative action and immigration. Now that Kemp has modified his views to reflect those of the party platform, the media is accusing him of flip-flopping.
<p>
	On CNN's coverage of the convention, political analyst Ken Bode was quick to attack Kemp: "Today Jack Kemp did a double back dive ten degree of difficulty on the issues of immigration and affirmative action." Questioning Vin Weber, co-chairman of the Dole campaign, CBS' Lesley Stahl asked: "Your longtime friend Jack Kemp has changed his long-held views, in the last two days, on affirmative action, on immigration policy. Is he selling his soul to be loyal to Bob Dole."
<p>
	While reporters consider President Clinton's flip-flops "moving to the center," they don*t see moves from Dole and Kemp in quite the same light. On the August 14 CBS Evening News, anchor Dan Rather quipped: "Bob Dole has reversed himself on deficit reduction versus tax cuts. Jack Kemp has reversed himself on how he feels about immigration. Isn*t that, or is it, going to make it more difficult to attack Bill Clinton on the character issue?" Interviewing Dan Quayle, NBC's Maria Shriver kept up the same line: "Let's talk about Jack Kemp [for] a minute. Today he reversed his position on immigration. Now in favor of expelling children of illegal immigrants from schools. How much does that damage his credibility."
<p>
	The questions were no different on the floor of the convention. On the August 14 World News Tonight, ABC's Jackie Judd got her angle from a liberal California delegate, claiming Kemp had "abandoned" that wing of the party. She started her story: "The quarterback became the acrobat today. Kemp was flip-flopping on long held positions to get in line with Bob Dole." It's not so unusual for a vice-presidential candidate to accommodate the views of the presidential candidate, but Kemp's change in position on these core issues fights the very image that he*s built for himself as an independent thinker."

</h2></center>
<h3>Speaking of Infomercials...</h3>
<p>
As network stars grumble about the tightly scripted "infomercial" the GOP convention has become, perhaps they should remember the infomercial-like tone some reporters employed to promote the Clinton-Gore ticket at their New York City convention in 1992:
ABC*s Jim Wooten introduced the convention on July 13, 1992: "That*s the ticket. Not a liberal in sight and that*s the picture Clinton wants the convention to leave with the country. Democrats happily moving from their liberal past to their centrist future...So Clinton and his moderates have captured the Democratic Party for the moment."
<p>
In the next morning's New York Times, reporter David Rosenbaum echoed ABC: "The views that dominated the party for so long, what was proudly called liberal, are hardly in evidence in Madison Square Garden this week...Mr. Mondale, who in 1984 was the last down-the-line liberal to win the Democratic presidential nomination and who lost 49 states to Ronald Reagan in November, said he was resigned to the change."
<p>
On the evening of July 14, 1992 Dan Rather announced: "Delegates approved the Clinton-Gore center-of-the-road Democratic Party platform, trying to move the party closer to the voters around the malls in America*s suburbs."
<p>
CBS This Morning reporter Bill Plante touted Clinton's momentum: "Everything seems to be going Clinton's way. They couldn't be happier here. They say that the candidate*s numbers are improving every day. They have their moderate platform. And things are just generally where they would want them to be."
<p>
Peter Jennings claimed on July 15, 1992: "He's become a little more disciplined, Bill Clinton, but you know he loves a crowd. And he has, don*t want to get carried away here, but he has the kind of hands people respond to."
<p>
From the floor of the convention NBC's Maria Shriver merely tried to get Elizabeth Glaser to repeat her nasty attack on Ronald Reagan: "You place responsibility for the death of your daughter [from AIDS] squarely at the feet of the Reagan administration. Do you believe they are responsible for that?"
<p>
Before savaging Barbara Bush in August, then-PBS anchor Judy Woodruff asked Hillary Clinton: "The Clinton campaign has been saying that this is a week that they were trying to tell the American people more about who Bill Clinton really is...What is it that you think the American people should know about your husband that they may not know or may not understand?"<p>

<center><h2><a name="women">Women</a> Naturally Scared by Republican Policies</h2> 
<h3>Morning Lectures on Tolerance</h3> </center><p>
 
Supposed GOP intolerance and how Republican policies scare women  
dominated interviews on Tuesday's Today and Good Morning  
America.<p> 
 
Talking to Susan Molinari, Christine Todd Whittman and  Kay  
Bailey Hutchison, GMA's Charlie Gibson laid out why women are  
turned off by Republicans: "It was the Republican Party that did  
take the lead on ending federal welfare payments as they have  
been traditionally paid over the last 50 to 60 years and the  
prime beneficiaries of that are women. It is the Republican Party  
that took the lead on reducing the rate of growth in Medicare and  
Medicaid. It is the Republican Party now that is trying to make  
an issue of denying education and benefits to the children of  
illegal immigrants. It is the Republican Party that has rejected  
in the last week or so, tolerance language on abortion in the  
platform."<p> 
 
Then he asked: "There was an attempt by some in the platform  
hearings to get language included in the platform that simply  
asked for toleration of dissenting views particularly on  
abortion. It was language that Bob Dole wanted in the platform.  
The party rejected him, it rejected your views, all three of you  
in this, is this a tolerant party, do you feel comfortable in it  
with its position on tolerance?"<p> 
 
Quizzing Colin Powell on Today, Katie Couric queried: "Does the  
party platform trouble you? Does the fact that that some of these  
governors opted not to speak because they were told they could  
not discuss their views on abortion, do all those things make you  
basically doubt that this is a big tent here?"<p> 
 
Tom Brokaw wondered: "Gen. Powell, the difference between having  
a position in your heart and campaigning on something as Jack  
Kemp now is going to be forced to do, is going to say to a lot of  
black Americans and a lot of people who feel that they are denied  
full access to the privilege of being a citizen in this country,  
`thats just utter hypocrisy. What is there in this platform or  
in this party tonight that says to the rest of the African- 
Americans out there, come on in, theres a place for you?"<p> 

<center><h2><a name="reporters">Reporters</a> Stick to "Extremist" Labels on Republicans  
</h2> 
<h3>Media Echoes of Clinton Consultants</h3></center> <p>
 
Using the description extreme to tar the Republican party did  
not begin in the convention aisles of San Diego, but in the  
sullen liberal reaction to the Republicans electoral sweep in  
1994. Clinton consultant Dick Morris advised his White House  
clients to tag their opponents as extremist while at the same  
time stealing many of their positions. The media echoed the  
Morris strategy. MediaWatch analysts used the Nexis news data  
retrieval system to search for the word extreme within 25 words  
of "Republican" or "Democrat" in the three news magazines (Time,  
Newsweek, and U.S. News & World Report) and USA Today from  
January 1, 1993 to May 31, 1996. <p> 
 
Analysts discovered reporters did not use many extremist labels  
in 1993 and 1994  41  but 26 of those were applied to  
Republicans, compared to ten mentions of dual extremes and only  
five for the Democrats who ruled both ends of Pennsylvania  
Avenue. Liberal moves to insure abortion on demand, gays in the  
military, nationalized health care, and massive tax increases  
werent beyond the media pale.  <p> 
 
But in the first 17 months of GOP control, Republicans were  
described as "extreme" in 123 stories, while only 15 found  
"extremes" on both sides. Just two mentioned "extreme" Democrats.  
In total, these six print outlets employed 149 extreme labels for  
Republicans to just seven for the Democrats.<p> 
 
USA Todays Richard Benedetto exemplified reporting on Republican  
extremism on June 16, 1995: "Democrats are trying to keep a stiff  
upper lip as they continue to oppose `extreme GOP cuts." Many of  
these were attributed to Democrats, but more than 20 came  
directly from reporters, such as Gloria Borgers March 11, 1996  
U.S. News suggestion that "taking on Buchananism would be good  
for Gingrich. Recall that until Buchanan surged, Gingrich was  
Washingtons resident extremist."<p> 
 
U.S. News & World Report reporter Kenneth Walsh claimed on March  
25, 1996: "Clintons feuds with some allies will make it harder  
to label him a liberal extremist, George Bush in 1988 caricatured  
Michael Dukakis." On October 27, 1995, Walsh happily noted:  
"President Clinton, playing Horatius at the bridge against the  
Republican hordes, is finally winning some favorable reviews.  
Democrats are rallying to his side as he defends the poor and  
elderly against GOP `extremism."<p> 
 
The "extreme" pattern also occurred in television coverage of the  
1996 presidential primaries. MediaWatch analysts studied the  
application of labels in primary stories from a week before the  
New Hampshire primary (February 13) to the South Carolina primary  
(March 2). Republicans and their supporters were labeled on 73  
occasions  45 of those extreme labels, almost all applied to  
Pat Buchanan. On February 25, 1996, CBS weekend anchor John  
Roberts asked consultant Joe Klein: "Some call Buchanan an  
extremist. Others call him American as apple pie. What is this  
fellows appeal?" Answered Klein: "He is both. He is an extremist  
and as American as apple pie." Using the same research parameters  
for a similar three-week period during the 1992 Democratic  
primaries, featuring ultraliberals like Tom Harkin and Jerry  
Brown, reporters used no extremist labels and only four  
applications of "liberal," all in the first two days of the study  
period.<p> 
 
In 1995, the networks introduced GOP presidential candidates by  
noting their "extremism." In 40 network stories introducing  
potential Republican challengers to Clinton, network reporters  
used 54 labels, 49 of which were "conservative" or more extreme.  
In fact, 19 labels, or 35 percent of the total, were labels such  
as "right," "far right," "hard right," "hard-line," "extremist,"  
'Republican fringe," and "ultraconservative fringe." On the  
February 24, 1995 CBS Evening News, reporter Linda Douglass  
alleged: "For years, critics have called [Sen. Phil] Gramm an  
extremist. But he argues these days his ideas are in the  
mainstream." In 27 stories introducing the Democratic candidates  
in 1991, none ever used an extreme term like "far left" or  
"ultraliberal."<p> 

<center><h2><a name="bryant">Bryant</a> Gumbel Scolds Delegates for Lack of Inclusion
But NBC Calls GOP-TV Unfair</h2></center> 

To keep "out what officials call the biased liberal media, NBCs 
Bob Faw reported Tuesday morning the RNC launched GOP-TV to 
provide complete convention coverage. Faw asserted: "What GOP TV 
calls unfiltered, doesnt even begin to pay lip service to 
balance or fairness." NBC should know.<p> 

Heres how Bryant Gumbel opened the Tuesday Today: "Good morning. 
Retired general Colin Powell, a new recruit to the GOP cause, 
addressed the delegates in San Diego last night, drawing cheers 
with accounts of why he became a Republican and why hell vote 
for Bob Dole. But although his speech was generally well-
received, the reception was restrained, and there were boos 
whenever Powell steered away from the right. Though they booed 
and also heckled dissent, Republicans claimed the mantle of 
inclusion throughout the first night of their convention. We can 
expect more of the same today, Tuesday, August 13, 1996."
Guess which network scares journalists? Faw reported that 
"Jonathan Alter of Newsweek thinks GOP TV has started something 
deceptive and unwholesome." Alter explained: "It is political 
propaganda, masquarading as news, and thats a problem."<p>

Political propaganda masquerading as news? Sounds like Bryant 
Gumbel.<p>

<center><h2>Republican Officials Grilled by Network Reporters
A <a name="Tax">Tax</a> on Credibility</h2></center>

The credibility of Bob Doles tax cut proposal arose as a topic 
for skeptical questions Tuesday night.<p> 

On PBS, referring to a Concord Coalition official, Margaret 
	Warner inquired of Dole economist John Taylor: "Does Martha 
Phillips have a point that its hard to credibly make the case 
that you can both cut taxes and balance the budget?"<p>

NBCs Maria Shriver asked New Jersey Governor Christie Todd 
Whitman: "Bill Clinton has said that Bob Doles proposal for the 
economy would end up crippling the economy, balloon the deficit. 
Why is he wrong?"<p>

Early in the evening, Tom Brokaw demanded of Virginias George 
Allen: "Governor, are you not at all concerned about what happens 
to the federal deficit, which is a major, major concern for most 
of the delegates at this convention, based on the polling that 
weve done, if Bob Dole is able to put into effect his 15 percent 
tax cut?"<p>

And: "But if you say to your constituents in the state of 
Virginia, Listen, were going to cut it by 15 percent, taxes, but 
I cant touch 60 percent of the budget that were dealing with 
here, and thats the reality thats facing Bob Dole because of 
Medicare and defense spending and other things, do you think that 
we can get home-free here in seven years and balance the 
budget?"<p> 

<center><h2><a name="Hutchison">Hutchison</a> Speech Tagged "Dangerous" by NBC: Republicans Pummeled from the Left </h2></center>

"Tonight they're ready to take on the Clinton record and try to convince 
a lot of undecided voters that this party is more inclusive than its 
reputation," Peter Jennings announced at the start of ABC's convention 
coverage Tuesday night. But the networks wouldn't let the Republicans 
succeed. NBC Nightly News on Tuesday night devoted its "In 
Depth" segment to "a major problem for the GOP, the gender gap, moderate 
women feeling left out."<p>

A few hours later NBC's Tim Russert relayed as accurate the Democratic 
analysis of the address by Texas Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison. He 
charged: "Key words: Mean-spirited and extremist. They want to avoid 
those labels. They have thus far after two days and that's why you're 
not going to see Newt Gingrich in prime time tonight. I think the 
speech by Senator Hutchison of Texas is dangerous, Tom, because she 
uses words that could be interpreted by some people as mean."<p>

Before the speech, Dan Rather offered a classic Ratherism: "Senator 
Kay Bailey Hutchison has now come out to the podium. She's expected 
to hit President Clinton, rhetorically, with everything short of a 
tire tube." But for the second night in a row Republicans were 
bombarded with questions and analysis that portrayed them as extreme 
and intolerant of anything outside their "rigid" views.<p>

The networks peppered the Republicans with questions from the liberal agenda. 
While the majority of questions dwelled on poll numbers and tactical gambits, 
interviews in the first two nights of prime-time network coverage 
featured 35 questions and statements from the left, to only four from 
the right. The evening newscasts contained eight liberal questions 
to zero conservative inquiries. One observation from the right last 
night: CNN's Judy Woodruff noting that "as a pro-life delegate said 
to me this morning..'I was interested in what Colin Powell had to 
say last night but I'm wondering when we're going to hear from a pro-liife 
point of view at the podium?'" For liberal questions, see pages 2 
and 3. <p>

Coverage focused on gender gap and intolerance on abortion as 
reporters suggested it's rational for women to not back the GOP. 

<center><h2><a name="Speechless">Speechless</a> Networks</h2></center>

In their "coverage" of the convention last night, none of the 
three broadcast networks gave any live airtime to prime time 
speeches by Reps. John Kasich and J.C. Watts and Gov. Christie 
Whitman. While ABC and CBS did show Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchisons 
speech in its entirety, NBC aired less than 2.5 minutes of it. 
While Hutchison was still speaking, NBC cut to Tim Russert, who 
gave the Democratic "rapid response" to it  even before it was 
over.<p>

Russert quoted the Democrats press release: "Once again the 
Republicans have showed the face of Bob Dole and Newt Gingrichs 
Republican Party through Sen. Hutchisons speech. It is nasty, 
gratuitous attacks against the President of the United States and 
mean-spirited." According to Russert, Hutchison gave the 
Democrats "what they wanted in order to respond in this way. 
Viewers just had to take his word for it.<p>

<h3>Summary or Pillory?</h3>

Tuesdays New York Times "convention summary" trashed the GOP 
platform: "The one adopted yesterday is extremely conservative, 
careening to the right on social issues like immigration, 
welfare, and homosexual rights, and omitting the word 'tolerance 
in an unbending abortion plank that fueled weeks of bitter 
intraparty debate."<p>

<h3>Two CBS Spins on Powell</h3>

Monday night Dan Rather said: "General Colin Powell was generally 
applauded by most of the delegates. There was a point, however, 
when he was clearly booed by many of the delegates in this hall. 
It wasnt just a case of scattered boos when Colin Powell said `I 
support a womans right to choose on abortion, and `Im a 
supporter of affirmative action. Thats the point when the boos 
came."<p>

On Tuesdays CBS This Morning co-host Jose Diaz-Balart delivered 
a different take: "General Colin Powell was the four-star hero of 
the evening, moving the crowd to numerous standing ovations and 
even cheers for his most controversial comments."<p>

<h3>Attention Bill Paxon</h3>

Keynote speaker Susan Molinari isnt married? During Tuesdays 
World News Tonight anchor Peter Jennings posed this question to 
an ABC reporter: "I want to go down to the floor for a moment to 
ask a fairly important question of Michel McQueen. Susan 
Molinari: single, white professional woman is going to be up 
there. You could argue that shes going to look out of place in 
some respects at this convention, couldnt you?" A few minutes 
later Jennings admitted he had `goofed.'<p>

<h3>A Bit of Media Intolerance?</h3>

As three MRC employees were leaving the Horton Grand Hotel in San 
Diego on Tuesday, they were approached by a woman wearing a 
Dateline NBC hat, traveling with three credentialed NBC 
cameramen. She inquired if their `Team Clinton' T-shirts were 
pro-Clinton, to which one MRC employee replied, "No, you have to 
read the whole thing." After she read the `pro-Clinton press 
corps' caption on the shirt featuring a drawing of three TV 
anchors, she quipped, "Oh, theyre anti-media. I guess the term 
`extremist still fits, huh?"<p>

<center><h2>Republicans Called Unconcerned About <a name="rape">Rape</a> Victims:
Another Round of Media Intolerance</h2></center>

Prime time and the evening news shows again emphasized how the 
Republican Party is shutting out pro-choicers and on how women 
are turned off by the party's stands. See page one for a tally on 
the agenda of questions.<p>

Keynoter Susan Molinari got grilled from the left by Tom 
	Brokaw on NBC Nightly News: After asking about how women can 
relate to a platform  that's "pretty rigid in its language on 
abortion," he posed this question: "In the convention hall itself 
tonight, as you try to reach out to American women across all 
spectrums of American life, you have here a delegates [sic] by a 
factor of two to one, white males, many of whom are making more 
than $100,000 a year. Doesnt that make it difficult for a lot of 
American women to identify with...."<p>

Just after rape victim Jan Licence's speech on victims rights 
last night, NBC's Maria Shriver seemed baffled: "But why [speak 
out] at a Republican convention? So many people have said that 
they dont think this ticket, or perhaps this party, is 
supportive of womens issues. Why make this stand here?" Tom 
Brokaw interviewed Licence later and asked: "Do you think -- this 
is a party that is dominated by men and this convention is 
dominated by men as well...Do you think before tonight they 
thought very much about what happens in America with rape?"<p>

ABC's Peter Jennings endorsed the "rights" spin of women who 
oppose the GOP's abortion plank: "Polls commissioned by the 
Republican party show they have lost nearly ten percent of women 
since they have voted the Republican majority into the 104th 
Congress in 1994. The right to abortion has never been an over-
whelming issue for women at election time. But this fight within 
the Republican party has many Republican women questioning how 
far this party is willing to go to limit their rights."<p>

Michel McQueen of ABC found the Democratic quota system to be 
better: "When you go to the Democratic convention in Chicago in 
two weeks youll see that half the delegates on the floor are 
women. And thats a powerful message when half the voters are 
women. But dramatically its also true that women have not 
responded well to a message that at times been considered too 
harsh, too mean."<p>

history will judge his time in office -- the deficits, the  
Iran-Contra affair. But for the members of this party, there is  
no more beloved figure." <p>

<P> 
<P> 
Monday's coverage of the Republican convention was a near carbon  
copy of the themes emphasized over the weekend. Viewers of Monday's  
morning shows heard repeated questions about why the Republicans excluded  
pro-choice voices. On the evening shows and in prime time coverage  
they heard references to the GOP's harsh, and extreme platform.  
Several reporters used retired General Colin Powell's speech as a  
foil to contrast his themes against the media-promoted image of the  
1992 convention. 
<P> 
Looking at the bright side of the Jack Kemp pick, on Today 
Monday morning NBC's Tim Russert argued it might prevent the  
GOP from employing a certain strategy: "This may be an enormous  
public service. If Jack Kemp's presence on the Republican ticket  
neutralizes the race issue, if the race card is not played in 1996  
because of Jack Kemp, he will have achieved more than any national  
figure in a long time. In 1988, the Willie Horton ad. Jack Kemp has  
said that was just absurd."

A Scary, Harsh, Extreme and Radical Republican Platform  
Not Even Counting Abortion. 
<P> 
On CBS Lesley Stahl declared without supporting information: "On  
the platform, women find that extreme. It's turning them off." 
Dan Rather asked Jack Kemp if he agreed that the platform is "harsh,  
extreme, even radical."  
<P> 
Exclusion of Pro-Choicers the Number One Concern of Reporters. Today's Katie  
Couric posed seven questions about abortion, even demanding that Dole's  
daughter Robin explain her abortion views. She asked Senator Kay  
Bailey Hutchison: "Do you still believe you can call the Republican  
Party an inclusive party?" See page 3. 
<P> 
Reporters Dismiss Dole Tax Plan as Failed Reaganomics. "Do you worry  
about the budget deficit ballooning as a result?" CNN's Bob Franken  
asked George Shultz on Monday.

<CENTER><H2><a name="the media's">The Media's</a> Exclusionary Rule</H2></CENTER> 
<P> 
Conventioneers Battered with Abortion Questions All Day 
<P> 
The networks stayed on message in harping on Republican exclusion  
of pro-abortion podium speakers. Just after noon Pacific time  
CNN's Charles Bierbauer asked Congressman Sam Brownback of  
Kansas: "But haven't some of those who might feel that abortion  
rights defensible, haven't they been excluded?" Candy Crowley  
asked pro-abortion Sen. Arlen Specter: "Do you think there is  
ever going to be room on the Republican ticket for someone like  
you?" 
<P> 
On NBC's Today on Monday, Katie Couric posed at least seven  
abortion questions.  To Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison: "You know a  
lot has been made of the Republican Party being a very inclusive  
party, one that can embrace the views of various people. Given  
the way the platform has worked out vis a vis abortion, and the  
fact that some of these Republican governors are not speaking  
because they felt, as if they were being censored. Do you still  
believe you can call the Republican Party an inclusive party?" 
<p> 
During the 1992 convention, Couric only asked Clinton's mother  
Virginia Kelley puff questions: "I also read in the many things  
that have been written about your son and his childhood that he  
used to walk to church alone with a Bible under his arm.' But  
Couric felt compelled yesterday to ask Dole's daughter Robin:  
"You all don't agree on all things political. I know you differ  
with him in terms of his views on abortion. Do you have  
discussions? Do you talk about it, talk it out, exchange views?" 
<P> 
But CNN exemplified an ironic new twist: excluding or downplaying  
conservatives wasn't censorship, but cleverly manipulative stage  
management. Reporter Frank Sesno declared Monday afternoon: "The  
placement of the various speakers at this convention is very  
purposeful and during this session, during this afternoon, some  
of the more hard line conservative speakers, such as Sam  
Brownback, were placed. We're not going to hear that rough edge  
tonight in prime time. Sesno's tone grew sharper: "The keynote  
speech will be delivered by a woman by the name of Susan  
Molinari. She is someone who is here with a very deliberate aim,  
and that is to take a belt sander to some of the sharper edges of  
the Republican Party." 
<P> 
ABC's Peter Jennings told Monday's San Diego Union Tribune:  
"Whenever a political party goes out of its way to restrain,  
isolate, or box in other voices , and both parties do it , then  
you almost invariably attract the attention of journalists." But  
Jennings ignored the Democrats' spiking of Bob Casey in 1992.  
Whether he lives up to his own statements this year will be  
tested in two weeks in Chicago.  

<CENTER><H2><a name="buchanan">Buchanan</a> "Destroyed" Bush </H2></CENTER> 
<P> 
<DD>  
Following Colin Powell's speech, reporters quickly pointed out the difference between this convention and  
the "divisive" Houston convention in 1992.   
<DD>  
Andrea Mitchell declared on MSNBC: "There's a real interesting contrast here because Pat Buchanan set  
the tone for the Houston convention four years ago with the same prime time starring role on the first night  
of the convention and that of course was the speech that many people feel destroyed George Bush's chance  
of winning re-election because it set a very narrow, exclusive and mean-spirited tone and tonight we had  
the contrast of Colin Powell."  
<DD>  
On Monday's Good Morning America, host Charles Gibson couldn't let the issue die: "It is this convention  
that is going to be harmonious. The Republicans are determined that there will be no repeat of Houston  
1992, which many saw as a harsh and divisive convention." While never mentioning that raising taxes  
could have cost Bush the election, ABC's John Cochran opined on World News Tonight: "The one thing  
that Bush did not have to tell Dole is that at all cost Dole should try to prevent a re-run of that bitter  
divisive convention four years ago in Houston, that so badly damaged Bush's chances for re-election. Dole  
knows that only too well."

<CENTER><H3>Abortion Not the Only Plank That Offends Media</H3></CENTER> 
<P> 
<P> 
<P> 
With the GOP showcasing the inoffensive lineup of former  
Presidents Ford and Bush as well as retired General Colin Powell,  
the networks made sure viewers learned that the Republican  
platform still upheld the party's ideological hard line. 
<P> 
NBC's David Bloom announced an amalgam of antis on Monday's  
Nightly News: "But not a word today from Bob Dole about the tough  
anti-immigration, anti-affirmative action, anti-abortion platform  
adopted this afternoon at the convention hall." Later in the  
show, NBC's Lisa Myers ended a story: "One Dole strategist has a  
different standard [of convention success]. He said he'll  
consider this convention a hit if the viewers end the week  
thinking Republicans aren't quite as scary as they thought." 
<P> 
"Even some Republicans describe the current platform as quote,  
harsh, extreme, even radical. Do you see it that way?" Dan Rather  
asked Jack Kemp on Monday's CBS Evening News.  
<P> 
During prime time, CBS reporter Lesley Stahl added: "The whole  
purpose of tonight's convention, the whole program, is to  
diminish the image of this party as extreme because that's what's  
turning the women off. Four years ago, the main speaker at the  
convention, the Republican convention, was Pat Buchanan. He was  
yelling, his pitchforks were raised. Tonight it will be Colin  
Powell, he will appeal to civility. On the platform, women find  
that extreme. It's turning them off." 






<CENTER><H2><a name="gutless">Gutless</a> Moderates?</H2></CENTER> 
<P> 
<P> 
In the August 19 Newsweek, Senior Editor Jonathan Alter gave pro- 
abortion Republicans his recipe for political success. In a piece  
titled "The Passion Gap," he wrote: "Pro-choice Republicans  
insist it's their party, too. But the high-minded moderates are  
too polite to take on the hard-charging right. Until they do, the  
GOP may never truly win over the country." 
<P> 
The crux of Alter's wisdom? Attack your most loyal voting block:  
"This is now the fifth nominating convention in which the GOP has  
applied an anti-abortion litmus test. Ronald Reagan signed an  
abortion-rights law as Governor of California, then changed his  
position in time for his presidential campaigns. George Bush was  
such a supporter of family planning as a congressman that he was  
called 'Rubbers,' but by the 1980s had flip-flopped. Bob Dole is  
pro-life but has gone back and forth so many times on platform  
language and planks that he has raised basic questions about his  
leadership. If he can't stand up to a Phyllis Schlafly, how would  
he handle a Saddam Hussein?" 
<P> 
Alter closed by holding up the Democratic Party, the same party  
that shut Governor Bob Casey out of its  1992 convention for his  
pro-life views, as an example of the big-tent the GOP should  
emulate: "The only real way to change the Republican Party is  
for...a pro-choice candidate to run for President in  
2000....Sometime soon a compelling moderate Republican will take  
a leaf from the successes of centrist Democrats and enter a few  
primaries. Then we'll find out if the Republicans can finally  
pitch that big tent they like to talk about." 
<P> 
<P> 
<CENTER><H3><a name="corporate">Corporate</a> Welfare Watch</H3></CENTER> 
<P> 
<P> 
Two reporters cheered Colin Powell's denunciation of corporate  
welfare last night, but they failed to mention which party tried  
to reduce it or how NBC is a recipient. 
On MSNBC, correspondent Andrea Mitchell never reflected on the  
hard choice her own network made when NBC decided to make money  
in prime time by joining up with PBS for convention coverage:  
"One of the things that I thought was interesting about Colin  
Powell's speech is that he did talk about the hard choices and he  
said, 'Listen friends, let me put it to you. We're going to have  
to give up corporate welfare as well and that entitlements are  
the real issue.'" 
<P> 
PBS anchor Charlayne Hunter-Gault said to Gary Bauer after Powell  
left the podium: "You heard the reaction in the room at the  
conclusion of the speech. You also heard Mark [Shields] say that  
when he talked about corporate welfare and welfare for the  
wealthy there was a deafening silence in the room. How do you  
think this crowd is really receiving this message." 
<P> 
The House Republicans tried to eliminate the Commerce Department,  
a fact not raised by either reporter. 
<P> 
<P> 
<CENTER><H3>Very Conventional Wisdom</H3></CENTER> 
<P> 
<P> 
Jonathan Alter's Conventional Wisdom Watch in the August 19  
Newsweek should be renamed Cliched Wisdom Watch for this well- 
worn slap at Ronald Reagan. Alter gave Reagan an up arrow: "'96  
GOP theme is `win another one for the Gipper' , and his big  
deficits, too."

<P> 
<P> 
<CENTER><H3>Tax Plan Declared Failed Reaganomics</H3></CENTER> 
<P> 
<P> 
The offering of tax cuts is universally seen as good politics,  
but that doesn't mean reporters won't try to make them unpopular.  
Bob Dole's new tax cut proposal and selection of Jack Kemp as his  
running mate may be making headway in the polls, but journalits  
are trying to put on the brakes. For reporters all tax cuts are  
bad.     
<P> 
Brand new CBS This Morning co-host Jose Diaz-Balart declared  
Monday: "It will be interesting to see if Bob Dole, who'd been  
skeptical of supply-siders like Jack Kemp in the past, can sell  
this to the American people without being perceived as a  
hypocrite." Other reporters assumed that supply-side economics is  
a failed doctrine and that tax cuts will "balloon" the deficit as  
they allegedly did in the Reagan years: 
<P> 
Just before noon Pacific time on Monday, CNN's Bob Franken asked  
George Shultz on the convention floor: "I wanted to talk to you  
about the fact that you worked with Republican Bob Dole on his  
economic plank. Were you pleased that there were tax cuts in  
there, and do you worry about the budget deficit ballooning as a  
result?" 
<P> 
On Inside Washington just before Dole released his plan, Newsweek  
Washington Bureau Chief Evan Thomas declared: "There are millions  
of quotes from Bob Dole all through the '80s saying, Look, you  
can't just cut taxes and expect the economy to do much better.  
Now he's screeched around, 180 degrees, and he's sounding like a  
pie-in-the-sky, Reaganomics professor. It's, it doesn't suit his  
character and he's giving up some high ground. Now Bill Clinton  
looks like the responsible guy." 
<P> 
Headline in the August 5 USA Today: "Dole's Tax Plan Could  
Backfire, Experts Say: Deficits, interest rates could rise."  
NBC reporter David Bloom quickly declared on the August 5,  
Nightly News: "Most economists say the Reagan tax cuts did  
worsen the budget deficit and many are skeptical of Dole's plan."  
Mike Jensen agreed about "most economists" minutes later: "They  
say these tax cuts could cause huge budget deficits as they did  
during the Reagan years, debt that would have to be paid off by  
future generations....Most analysts say it's not good economics." 
<P> 
Minutes after Dole's tax cut address that day, U.S. News & World  
Report Senior Writer Susan Dentzer suggested on CNN that the  
people didn't care about fiscal realities: "I think it's going to  
sell very well among those who, for one thing, think that  
government is taxing them too heavily and don't have a  
calculator, don't particularly care about the details of federal  
fiscal policy and don't particularly want to add up the  
dimensions of the problem or stare into the future that we know  
we face." 
<P> 
<P> 
Newsweek reporter Howard Fineman stressed in the August 12 issue  
that Dole "risks his most cherished asset: his credibility...Now  
he's embracing supply-side economics, years after it came (and  
went) in GOP circles. So late in his career , so late in his  
campaign , it looks desperate. Clinton, meanwhile, can brag that  
the annual deficit on his watch , and that he's a champion of  
fiscal responsibility. In other words, he can be Bob Dole." 
<P> 
<CENTER><H3><a name="reality">Reality</a> Check:</H3></CENTER> 
<P> 
<P> 
Monday's Investor's Business Daily pointed out: "Just turn to  
page 369 of the 'Economic Report of the President'...A table  
shows that receipts from individual income taxes rose to $446  
billion in fiscal '89, President Reagan's last budget, from $286  
billion in fiscal '81, the year Reagan began to slash personal  
rates. That's a 56 percent gain. Annualized, tax receipts grew  
faster than the period's average 4 percent inflation. The problem  
was clearly NOT a fall in revenues. It was the other side of the  
ledger: Spending grew even faster. Look at the 'total outlays''  
column in the same table. Spending rose to $1.143 trillion in '89  
from $678 billion in '81. That's a 69 percent gain. It's no  
surprise that Clinton, a professional politician, would brush  
over such inconvenient facts. Media figures who claim to have no  
hidden agendas, on the other hand, have no excuse."  
<P>
<P> 
<CENTER><H3><a name="inside">On Inside</a> Washington:</H3></CENTER> 
<P> 
Evan Thomas, Newsweek's Washington bureau chief: "I think 
this is really disappointing. 
<P> And more advice from the left from Thomas: "Maybe pandering  
works,  
but the polls don't show that. The polls, I think, even Dole's  
own  
polls show that most people reject this tax cut because they  
don't  
believe it. They got conned in the 1980s by Reagan, they got a  
tax cut, 
but they still got a, it didn't do what he predicted it would do 
to the economy. They're in a highly cynical mode, I don't think 
they believe his pandering. In fact, if you ask the question, 'Do 
you approve a tax cut if it would increase the deficit?' only 11 
percent of the country, according to one reputable poll, went 
for it, so I think it's lose-lose." 

<CENTER><H2><a name="millionaire">Millionaire</a> Anchors Tag GOP Delegates As Out of Touch with Middle America</h2></center>
<P> 
<P> 
Early in Monday's PBS/NBC coverage, Tom Brokaw asked: "The big question, of course, what is the  
Republican Party these days?...Well on the floor of this convention hall, they are overwhelmingly white  
and male, male by a factor of about two to one...The largest single income group, more than 38 percent of  
the people here earn more than $100,000 a year." Some additional examples from Monday of how the  
networks created an image for viewers of an out of touch elite gathered in San Diego: 
<P> 
Ed Bradley on the CBS Evening News last night: "For the most part they are white, male, and they are  
older than the average American. They are also more conservative than the average American. They are  
also wealthier , about a third of the delegates earn more than $100,000 a year." 
<P> 
Dan Rather in prime time: "Delegates in this convention have been selected, inspected, detected,  
categorized by the press, the pols, the pros, and the pollsters. We know they're mostly male,  
overwhelmingly white, mostly well to the right politically, and almost one in five of these delegates is a  
millionaire." 
<P> 
CNN's Judy Woodruff to Susan Molinari: "We look at the statistics of how many women delegates. What?  
43 percent in 1992. Only 36 percent of the delegates are women this year. What sort of signal does that  
send to the country, you think? 
<P> 
Woodruff again last night: "We talked to Jack Kemp a little while ago and asked him about, among other  
things, the fact that not only not just the language in the platform , only three percent of these delegates are  
African American. Only 36 percent of these delegates are women. This is not a convention that is  
necessarily representative even of the broader Republican Party, the people who vote Republican, much  
less the electorate overall." 
<P> 
So, will these reporters apply equal treatment to the unreprersentative Democrats gathering in Chicago in a  
few days?  <p>

<p>
Below is the full text of today's four-page Media Reality Check
'96 newsletter on network coverage of the Republican convention.
It's being distributed today in San Diego.
<p>
This is a very long document, but I thought it would be a lot
easier to put it all in one place than send several e-mails. So,
below:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Quote of the Day
<li>Page One story summarizing the day's themes.
<li>Page Two story on TV analysts calling conservatives "mean-spirited" and hateful.

<h3> Quote of the Day:</h3>
"Governor, looking at this platform writing the last week, what
in the world is good in there for a moderate Republican or an
independent voter in this country?" -- CBS correspondent Phil
Jones to Texas Governor George W. Bush, August 11 Face the
Nation.
<p>
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
<p>
<h3> Front Page story, Monday, August 12, 1996:</h3>
<p>
<h3>Call GOPers Mean, Intolerant & Hard Line
Media's Unwelcome Greeting</h3>
<p>
Republicans and conservatives came under media assault in the
days  and hours before they assembled at the San Diego Convention
Center. The intolerance of conservatives, their hard line stance
on abortion  and mean-spirited nature were the dominant themes of
weekend coverage  on the networks. Though VP nominee Jack Kemp
largely escaped condemnation,  network analysts used praise of
him as an opportunity to impugn conservatives overall.
<p>
<h3>Inside today's edition:</h3>
<p>
Mean-spirited and hateful  Republicans. CBS, CNN and ABC all
refer to "mean-spirited" conservatives. The Wall Street Journal's
Al Hunt tagged the  platform as "mean-spirited." CNN's Bill
Schneider charged that "they're  supposed to be haters" as "most
conservatives these days," such as House Speaker Newt Gingrich,
"come across as mean." CNN's Judy Woodruff  said that at least
Kemp does not like the idea of "yanking money away  from welfare
mothers with small children." See page 2.
<p>
Intolerant Republicans Bar Wilson from Speaking. On four Sunday
network mornings shows
Republicans were pounded with 22 questions about why pro-choice
Governors Pete  Wilson and Bill Weld were not going to be allowed
to speak. That's  a dramatic contrast to what happened in 1992
when the networks virtually ignored the Democratic Party decision
to bar pro-life Governor Bill Casey from speaking to their
convention. Wilson apeared on ABC, but  the network didn't
interview Casey in 1992. See page 3.
<p>
"Rogue Elephants" Take Over GOP and Spell Sure Defeat. Using
labels to paint delegates as extremists, CBS aired several
stories about the ominous takeover of the Republican Party by, in
Dan Rather's words, "the hard right." CBS reporter Linda Douglass
worried that if Bob Dole appears to be "under the thumb of
religious conservatives" he'll go down to defeat. See page 4.

<h3>GOP Called "Mean" & Conservatives Dubbed "Haters"
TV Analysts Turn Nasty</h3>
<p>
A  "mean-spirited" and "divisive" convention attended by "haters"
is how some network reporters and analysts, especially CNN s Bill
Schneider, have described the Republican convention and
conservatives over the past few days. Often, the comment came in
backhanded insults in stories praising Jack Kemp s tolerance.
Here, in date order, are some specific examples:
<p>
CBS s Russ Mitchell. On Friday s CBS This Morning, co-host Russ
Mitchell asked RNC Chairman Haley Barbour: "Now the 1992
convention was called, even by some Republicans, divisive and
mean-spirited. How will this convention be different?"
<p>
CNN's Bill Schneider. Hours later on Inside Politics Bill
Schneider, CNN s polling analyst, praised Jack Kemp by impugning
conservatives: "He is a rare combination a nice conservative.
These days conservatives are supposed to be mean. They re
supposed to be haters. Bob Novak talked a minute ago about the
frowning face of the Republican Party. Jack Kemp is buoyant, he s
effusive, he s inclusive of everybody in the country, not just in
the Republican Party. He puts a different face on that ticket."
<p>
ABC s Cokie Roberts. Then on Friday night's World News Tonight
Cokie Roberts also insulted Republicans while calling Kemp a good
choice: "He s very optimistic, but he's also very inclusive,
reaching out to minorities, to women, being for immigration, for
affirmative action. And I think that s very important for this
particular convention, Peter, and this party, which is seen
somewhat dour, and somewhat mean in its ways to have someone with
a big smile on his face saying you all come, and I m going to cut
your taxes while I m at it is not a bad thing for the
Republicans."
<p>
CNN s Al Hunt. On the August 10 Capital Gang Saturday night Al
Hunt, Executive Washington Editor of The Wall Street Journal,
disparaged the platform while praising the Kemp pick: "But, you
know, privately the Democrats know that this is an enlightened
choice, whatever Chris Dodd may say publicly. Jack Kemp is gonna
not only excite this convention, but he cuts across regional,
racial and generational lines, across all of America, and I think
that he and his incredibly attractive family are going to add
lustre and intellectual firepower. Now there are some risks. He
has a few flaky views, the gold standard for one, and more
important, Jack Kemp is a can-do optimist who cares about all
people and that s going to put him at odds with a platform that
is protectionist, mean-spirited, anti-immigration, insensitive to
racial minorities."
<p>
CNN s Judy Woodruff: During live coverage Saturday of the VP
announcement in  Russell, Kansas,  Judy Woodruff declared: "On
welfare, up through the last few years, he s advocated more
moderate policies than those that were passed this month by the
Republican-controlled Congress. Jack Kemp does not like the idea
of taking money yanking money way from welfare mothers with small
children."
<p>  
CNNs Schneider. On Saturday s Inside Politics Schneider again
impugned conservatives as he praised Jack Kemp s tolerance: "Kemp
also has a rare combination of qualities. He s a nice
conservative. There haven t been too many of those since Ronald
Reagan. Most conservatives these days come across as mean [video
of Newt Gingrich] or intolerant [video of Pat Buchanan]. Kemp is
tolerant and inclusive. He has an excellent relationship with
minorities. He showed real courage two years ago when he came out
against Proposition 187, the punitive anti-illegal immigration
measure in California. Kemp is not a hater." 
<p>
So most conservatives are? Sounds like a bit of mean-spirited
name calling on behalf of the media.

<h3>Networks That Ignored Casey Dive Into GOP Controversy
The Fascinating Wilson Flap</h3>
<p>  
ABC's Cokie Roberts asked Dole adviser Donald Rumsfeld on This
Week with David Brinkley yesterday: "We just heard Jim Wooten
talking about [California Gov.] Pete Wilson not talking at this
convention. Governor Weld is also not talking at this  
convention. Republicans for years have been talking about the
Democrats not allowing [then-Pennsylvania Gov.] Bob Casey to talk
at their last convention. What s different here?" What s
different is that the lack of speaking assignments for Weld and
Wilson are spurring major media interest. 
<p>
Just during the Sunday morning interview shows, the networks
asked 22 questions about exclusion of pro-abortion Republicans.
During the entire Democratic convention week in 1992, Casey s
predicament drew absolutely no mention from Cokie s network, nor
any attention from CBS; NBC aired just one interview with Gov.
Casey, as did CNN, which added four other mentions of the
underplayed controversy  in prime time. Yesterday, 11 questions
about the GOP s  exclusion of moderates were posed on CNN s Late
Edition, compared to five on NBC s Meet the Press, four on ABC s
This Week, and two on CBS's Face the Nation.
<p>
If pro-choice forces cannot prevail, then why even hold a
convention asked one morning show host last week. Today co-host
Matt Lauer asked Gov. Wilson on  August 8: "You said a second ago
that the majority of Republicans across the country are on your
side on this issue, but the majority of people who ll attend this
convention are not. Why then even hold the convention if it
doesn't express or represent the views of the majority of people
in the party?"

<h3> Page Three, Monday, August 12, 1996</h3>
<p>  
<h3>Sixty TV Stories on the GOP to One for the Democrats
Abortion Plank Imbalance</h3>
<p>  
As the surf arrives on San Diego s beaches, once again the
national media are hanging ten on their favorite convention
story: Republican fratricide over the platform s abortion
plank. Since April 30, when Governors Weld, Wilson, Whitman, and
Pataki declared their intention to challenge the platform s
traditional pro-life plank, the networks have focused like a
laser beam on the story, while ignoring any debate within the
Democratic party:
<p>
>From April 30 to August 9, the Big Three networks (ABC, CBS, and
NBC) have favored the Republican side of the story by 60 to 1.
They  aired 30 full stories on the evening newscasts, to only one
ABC World News Tonight story on the Democratic abortion debate on
June 12. The network morning shows have aired another 30 full
stories or interview segments on the GOP abortion debate, to
nothing on the Democrats. (That doesn t include five anchor
briefs on the evening shows and 34 anchor briefs on the morning
shows.)
<p>
CNN's evening newscast The World Today aired seven full stories
and ten anchor briefs on the GOP pro-life plank, to only one
anchor brief on the Democrats. CNN s Inside Politics was
intensely interested in the story, with 38 full stories or
interview segments on the GOP to two segments on the Democrats.
<p>
Perhaps the dramatic imbalance of stories will change when the
Democrats hold their platform hearings? Wrong. The Democrats
already held their platform hearings (on July 10 and 11, then
concluding on August 5) with absolutely no notice from ABC, CBS,
or NBC. You also couldn't read about them in Time, Newsweek, or
U.S. News & World Report. Even daily newspapers such as the Los
Angeles Times and USA Today, with hundreds of pages of newsprint
to fill every week, spiked the story.
<p>
Judd, June 12: "An ABC News survey shows that a third of
Democrats oppose all or most abortions, but centrists and
liberals have no intention of surrendering any ground." Judd
dismissed the threat of pro-lifers actually leaving the party:
"The issue of abortion has not splintered the Democratic party
because those who couldn t live with the party's position
bolted years ago." She concluded: "So given their reluctance to
publicly fight with the party mainstream, abortion opponents will
probably be seen, but not heard at their party's convention this
summer."

<p>
<h3>Networks Worry About Ominous Party Takeover by Christians
"Rogue Elephants" No More</h3>
<p>
Colin Powell and Susan Molinari are set to deliver major speeches
to the Republican convention, but network news reporters over the
weekend portrayed the Republican Party as a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Christian Right, painting that as an ominous
development. 
<p>
On Friday, August 9, Dan Rather introduced a CBS Evening News
piece by asserting: "For many self-described Christian
conservatives and other members of what is generally known as the
hard right of the Republican Party, they ve been pretty much
having their way at the San Diego convention, and the Jack Kemp
news late today was one more cause for celebration. But there
could be pitfalls ahead for the party, as we hear now from Linda
Douglass."
<p>
Douglass began: "It already has been a triumphant week for
religious conservatives, led by the Christian Coalition. Then
came word of another victory, the prospect of Jack Kemp as Bob
Dole's running mate." Following a soundbite from Ralph Reed, she
continued: "The Christian Coalition has gotten what it wanted
here, even forcing Dole to back down from his offer of tolerance
to supporters of abortion rights. Religious conservatives say
they now hold the key to a Dole victory in November."
<p>
After a soundbite from the Christian Coalition s Ralph Reed,
Douglass continued: "But veterans of past Republican presidential
campaigns warn Dole runs the risk of appearing to be under the
thumb of religious conservatives. Some analysts believe Gerald
Ford was hurt in 1976 by giving in to a conservative faction.
Doug Bailey, who advised Ford then, said Dole must be careful." 
The same night on PBS s Washington Week in Review host Ken Bode
claimed that "it turns out that this platform committee that met
is a far more conservative group of delegates, than we've
seen even in Republican conventions of the past."
<p>
On Sunday s Face the Nation, CBS correspondent Phil Jones seemed
obsessed with the topic. Jones asked Governor George Bush, "There
are a number of Republicans who are very uncomfortable with what
they feel is the power, the control that the conservative
Religious Right has. Are you concerned about that?" Jones also
accused Pat Robertson of swallowing the Republican Party: "A lot
of moderate Republicans have watched what s going on here in the
last week in the writing of the platform, and they say you
people, you, Pat Robertson and your wing of the Republican party,
Christian conservatives, have taken over."
<p>
"Delegates are pursuing their own agendas and forcing party
leaders, including Dole, to fall into line behind them," warned
Dan Rather on last night s CBS Evening News. Taking a look at the
Texas delegation, reporter John Roberts found that "so far the
rogue elephants seem to be calling the shots: winning the
platform battle over abortion and heavily influencing Bob Dole s
choice for Vice President." 
<p>
Employing some extremist labeling, Roberts said that "hardline
anti-abortionists" tried to keep Texas Senator Kay Bailey
Hutchison from becoming a delegate. But in the end, Roberts
assured viewers, the conservatives really won't win: "This
exercise in gaining political influence may turn out to be just
that: an exercise. Bob Dole says he has not yet read the party
platform and even if he does he says he will not feel bound by
it. And it could be a case for the Texas delegation of
winning the battle but losing the war. Their views against
abortion are in contrast with the majority of Americans who
support a woman s right to choose. That could turn out to be a
contentious issue come November."

<h2>***MRC CyberAlert: From San Diego***</center></h2><p>

<center><h3>    One item today: <p></center></h3>
A Media Reality Check '96 fax report released Wednesday 
afternoon. Back on June 22, 1992 CBS This Morning co-host Paula Zahn 
announced: "Making headlines this morning: Bill Clinton comes up with a 
plan for the economy. Tax the rich, cut the deficit, and help just about 
everyone else." That's not quite how reporters have greeted Bob Dole's tax 
cut plan. In this report we compared and contrasted how media outlets which
have tried to discredit Dole's proposal were the very same outlets which
praised Clinton's economic and health plans.<p>
    The following is the text of the report put together by Tim Graham with 
the assistance of Tim Lamer and the rest of our crew in Alexandria: <p>

<center><h3>The Voodoo Gap: The Media's Partisan Economics</center></h3><p>

<i>SAN DIEGO, CA</i> -- Bob Dole's tax cut proposal was quickly denigrated by 
reporters as the unwelcome return of irresponsible Reaganomics, but the 
outpouring of media skepticism about Dole's tax proposal in no way resembles 
the national media's salesmanlike reaction to Clinton proposals in 1992 and 
1993.<p>

"Raising questions about how Bob Dole's going to cut taxes and balance the 
budget is fair," said MRC Chairman L. Brent Bozell III. "What's not fair is 
attacking Dole's credibility after you've swallowed Clinton's bizarre fiscal 
estimates whole. After passing on the fantasy of a self-financing Clinton 
health plan and 1,000 descriptions of Medicare `cuts,' the media ought to
think about their own credibility on budget matters before they pretend to be 
nonpartisan skeptics of Dole." Among the outlets with a bad case of partisan 
economics:<p>
 
NBC. Reporter David Bloom quickly declared on the August 5, 1996 Nightly News:  
"Most economists say the Reagan tax cuts did worsen the budget deficit and 
many are skeptical of Dole's plan." Mike Jensen agreed about "most economists" 
minutes later: "They say these tax cuts could cause huge budget deficits as 
they did during the Reagan years, debt that would have to be paid off by future 
generations....Most analysts say it's not good economics." NBC did not note as 
columnist James Glassman pointed out Tuesday, that according to Clinton's own
Economic Report of the President, tax revenues increased from $601 billion in 
1983 to $991 billion in 1989, but spending rose from $808 billion in 1983 to 
$1.143 trillion in 1989.<p>

Clinton often drew praise. NBC reporter Lisa Myers raved on the February 18, 
1993 Today: "The President deserved great, great credit for having the courage 
to come forward with a plan to deal responsibly with the deficit." NBC's Andrea 
Mitchell worried about his image on the May 2, 1993 Meet the Press: "This is 
the first President in a generation who had the guts to try to do something 
about deficit reduction and take on health care, and somehow he's not selling 
that. He's still being perceived as an old-style Democrat."<p>
 
CBS. Reporter Linda Douglass declared on the July 23, 1996 CBS Evening News: 
"Dole will have to tread carefully as he promotes his tax cut. Each of the 
proposals he's considering would cost hundreds of billions of dollars, and 
Dole will have to convince voters that won't drive up the deficit."<p>
 
But on the September 15, 1993 Sunday Morning, Douglass simply passed on 
Clinton's notion of paying for 37 million uninsured Americans' health care -- 
with a cigarette tax: "They have a very elaborate plan to pay for this 
revolution in health care. It doesn't provide for much new in the way of 
taxes, just a sin tax, cigarette tax. They claim the money's going to come 
from savings in spending." The Clinton health proposal was estimated by the 
Congressional Budget Office to cost $784 billion in its first seven years.<p>

U.S. News & World Report. Senior Writer Susan Dentzer was the first to 
condemn Dole's tax cut on CNN just minutes after Dole was finished: "The old 
joke among economists is that an economist who's stuck in a ditch gets out
of it by assuming the existence of a ladder, and there are a fair amount of 
assumptions of existences of ladders in this plan that really, I think, under
intense scrutiny, are not going to bear out." Appearing on Nightline a few 
hours later, she called the Dole plan "a free lunch."<p>
 
Dentzer, on the other hand, applauded Clinton's micromanagement of the 
economy in the March 15, 1993 U.S. News: "Amid a broader economic plan that 
has its share of flaws, Clinton's well-crafted stimulus is a piece worth 
keeping...The sorts of spending the President has picked -- for example on 
education or on long-planned highway projects -- tend to create lots of jobs, 
many which carry high wages and benefits."<p>
 
Newsweek. Reporter Howard Fineman wrote in the latest issue that Dole "risks 
his most cherished asset: his credibility....Now he's embracing supply-side 
economics, years after it came (and went) in GOP circles. So late in his career 
-- so late in the campaign -- it looks desperate. Clinton, meanwhile, can brag 
that the annual deficit has been cut in half on his watch -- and that he's a 
champion of fiscal responsibility. In other words, he can be Bob Dole."<p>

Fineman had a different idea of who was responsible for the deficit on the 
October 11, 1995 Fox Morning News: "He [Clinton] really doesn't have to put 
numbers on the table. It's the Republicans who have said they're the 
revolutionaries. They're the ones with the responsibility."<p>
 
Time. Washington Bureau Chief Dan Goodgame declared on September 20, 1993: 
"The Clinton plan is surprisingly persuasive in supporting the long-time 
claim of the Clintons and their top health care strategist, Ira Magaziner, 
that [health] reform can be almost entirely from savings, without broad-based 
new taxes and with enough left over to reduce the federal budget deficit." 
But in the January 29, 1996 issue, Goodgame described the 1980s as "when top
tax rates were slashed and the deficit soared, but that's the reason supply-
siders are often described as optimists." <p>

<h2> ***MRC CyberAlert: From San Diego***</h2></center><p>
 <center><h3>One item today:</h3></center><p>
    A Republican Party platform subcommittee passed a plank stating:
"We also recognize that members of our party have deeply held and sometimes 
differing views. We view this diversity of views as a source of strength."<p>
    Nonetheless, the very networks which barely touched in 1992 the refusal
of the Democratic Party to allow Pennsylvania Governor Bob Casey to make a 
pro-life speech at their convention, pounced on the GOP Tuesday night for 
intolerance.<p>
    --  Here's how Peter Jennings opened the August 6 World News Tonight: 
"Good evening. We begin tonight with what you could certainly call zero 
tolerance. As much as Bob Dole would like to have the nation focus on his
very sweeping tax cutting proposals of yesterday, the men and woman who
will join him at his party's political convention in a few days are once 
again involved in a power struggle about abortion. Today by the time Mr. 
Dole spoke by satellite to his party's delegates, who were already gathered
in San Diego, all notions of tolerance on the subject of abortion had 
disappeared from the party's platform."<p>

    -- On the NBC Nightly News reporter Gwen Ifill's piece ended by showing 
Massachusetts Governor Bill Weld saying in a soundbite: "I don't want to 
drum the pro-lifers out of the party. I just want there to be room for me 
and them within the same description of the party."<p>
    Ifill then concluded: "But there's not enough room for the words abortion 
and tolerance to co-exist in this party's platform. Dole is gambling that 
voters care more about the economy and taxes than they do abortion. But he 
has undercut moderate Republicans at a time when he needs every vote he can 
get. Gwen Ifill, NBC News, San Diego."<p>

     It just shows that it pays to suppress any dissent. When you allow debate
and what reporters consider the wrong side wins they call you intolerant. <p>

<h3>Brokaw Attacks Clinton from Left</h3>
</center>
<p>
July 16, 1996
<p>
One item today: Tom Brokaw challenges President Clinton from
the left in the premiere of "Internight," the 8pm ET interviewshow on the new MSNBC cable network.
<p>
Here are two questions posed by Brokaw in his live July 15 interview:
<p>
    > Brokaw: "Let's talk for a moment about welfare. The
Republicans have a bill that they think you will sign, on the
Hill. It eliminates the federal guarantee of cash assistance for
poor children in this country, a guarantee that we've had in
place since the early 1930s. Are you prepared to have that
happen?"
<p>
    Clinton: "Depends on what else is in the bill."
<p>
    Brokaw: "But you can foresee the possibility that we'll take
away the ultimate safety net of no federal cash assistance to
very poor children?"
<p>
And a couple of segments later:
<p>
    Brokaw: "Mr. President, before we get back to the internet
questions, I wanted to follow up just for a moment on welfare if
I can. If in fact you sign the Republican bill that's likely to
come down from the Hill, all the projections show that that will
push, at least short term, more than a million youngsters in this
country below the poverty line. That's a high risk for youngsters
in this country who are already in peril."
<p>
Another network, another pile of bias to document. -- Brent

<h3>Chancellor Reality Check</h3>
</center>
<p>
July 14, 1996
<p>
One item in this MRC Alert: 
<p>
> John Chancellor is being praised for his fairness, but a reviewof his commentaries show he used his position to promote liberalideas and attack conservatives.
<p>
As you may know, NBC News veteran John Chancellor passed away
at age 68 on Friday evening. From 1970 to 1982 he anchored the
NBC Nightly News, then provided commentary through 1993. During
the Johnson Administration he presided over the Voice of America.
His passing has generated a series of tributes to his
fairness and impartiality from his media colleagues. On the July
13 NBC Nightly News, for instance, anchor Brian Williams
observed: "He was a role model for all who care about truth,
justice and fairness. John Chancellor died last night of cancer,
two days short of his 69th birthday. He helped define what TV
news should be."
<p>
Let's take a look at the views expressed in some of his
Nightly News commentaries in the late 1980s and early 1990s:
<p>
    -- April 17, 1990: "The overall tax burden for Americans,
federal, state, and local, is actually quite low....The fact is
Americans could pay more taxes and the country wouldn't go down
the tube. Taxpayers don't believe this because they are being
conned by the politicians...The truth is that the United States
needs higher taxes and can afford them. Some political leaders
are now starting to say that, but until more say it, the country
will remain in trouble."
<p>
    -- August 21, 1991, on the Soviet Union: "It's short of soap,
so there are lice in hospitals. It's short of pantyhose, so
women's legs go bare. It's short snowsuits, so babies stay home
in winter....The problem isn't communism; nobody even talked
about communism this week. The problem is shortages." 
<p>
    -- March 12, 1992: "Greenpeace, the public interest
organization, believes that the Iraqi death toll, civilian and
military, before and after the war, may be as high as 198,000.
Allied military dead are counted in the low hundreds. The
disparity is huge and somewhat embarrassing. And that's
commentary for this evening, Tom." 
<p>
    -- Election night, 1992, looking back at the Republican
convention: "I think that the convention -- and certainly all the
polling data indicates this -- offended a lot of women, offended a lot of people in the country who thought it was too religious
and too hard-edged." 
<p>
    -- February 16, 1993: "There is no mystery in how [the
deficit] can be brought down...the U.S. simply has to choose from
a menu of unpalatable options that include deeper cuts in defense
spending, tougher controls on medical services, higher taxes on
federal pensions, and a broad-based tax on energy or consumption,
preferably both. We know how to do this. Impose measures already
commonplace in other industrialized countries. The weapons are
there. It's the will to use them that's the problem."
<p>
    -- April 30, 1992, after the Los Angeles riots: "It's not a
big surprise that the jury in suburban Simi Valley sided with the
white policemen. Just as it's no surprise that the blacks in
downtown Los Angeles rioted and people died....Politicians have
fanned these flames with code words about `welfare queens,'
`equal opportunity,' and `quotas.' Language designed to turn
whites against blacks. With two-party politics that favored the
rich and hurt everyone else."
<p>
    -- November 20, 1990: "Some say Ronald Reagan won the Cold
War by spending so much on defense that the Kremlin went bankrupt
trying to keep up. That won't wash. During Reagan's presidency
the United States itself became a bankrupt country."
<p>
    -- November 7, 1990: "The fact is that most government
spending cannot be cut. The way out of the mess is for the
government to raise some money through taxes and at last that's
being done. And there's encouraging news in the returns from
yesterday's elections. Six states from Massachusetts to
California rejected measures designed to limit taxation. Can it
be that the great tax revolt of the 1980s is coming to an end? If
true, maybe the country can get on with the business of balancing
its books in a sensible and logical way." 
<p>
    -- June 20, 1989: "Thousands may have been gunned down in
Beijing, but what about the millions of American kids whose lives
are being ruined by an enormous failure of the country's
educational system...We can and we should agonize about the dead
students in Beijing, but we've got a much bigger problem here at
home."
<p>
    -- Finally, here's the July 1990 MediaWatch newsbite on
Chancellor's 1990 book. He's no fan of Ronald Reagan:
<p>
Once anchor of NBC Nightly News, John Chancellor now offers his
opinions thrice weekly. His commentaries have recently been
distilled into a book on what's wrong with America, Peril and
Promise.
<p>
So what's wrong? The deficit, which he attributed to a Reagan
recipe of "big tax cuts, big increases in defense spending, and a
hair curling recession." Pardoned from blame: congressional mismanagement. And though federal revenues went up swiftly in the
'80s, Chancellor remembered only that "cuts in taxes and domestic
spending resulted in the first redistribution of income in favor
of the affluent since the 1920s and a reduction of the federal
government's obligation to the poor." Another Reagan error was
the Grenada liberation which Chancellor called "a sham triumph,"
a "tragicomedy," which "might not have been necessary."
<p>
Chancellor harped on America's faults for 130 pages, but
dedicated fewer than 40 pages to suggesting solutions. He called
his remedies to America's woes neither conservative nor liberal,
yet higher taxes remained the pillar of his plan. Another major
objective: mobilization of a national corps of volunteers because
"The poor and disadvantaged need help, especially after the
cutbacks in social services during the Reagan years."
<p>
I'll be sending another e-mail late tonight with some more
recent bias from Sam Donaldson and coverage of Dole and the
NAACP. -- Brent Baker

<p>
<h3>More Hate Radio; Dole Fuels "Racial Divides"</h3>
</center>
<p>
July 12, 1996 
<p>
Four items today:
<ul>
<li>A Time magazine reporter attributes the First Lady's problems
not to any wrongdoing but to the fact that "Mrs. Clinton has
changed the role of First Lady."
<li>Eleanor Clift charges that the evil "right-wing mafia" are
fueling "hate radio."
<li>Newsweek's Joe Klein finds a bright spot in the public's lack
of concern over controversies dogging the Clintons: It may lead
to the end of such distracting scandal-mongering. 
<li>NBC portrays Bob Dole's lack of appearance at the NAACP
convention as "an insult to African-American voters" which "may
reinforce...racial divides along party lines."
<p>
> 1) This quote was picked up by MRC analyst Gene Eliasen fromthe June 28 Washington Week in Review. Time magazine Washingtonreporter Michael Duffy thinks the First Lady is surrounded bycontroversy because she's doing so much more: "I also think thatMrs. Clinton has changed the role of First Lady so much, youknow, by getting so involved and so active and paid such a highprice for it."
<p>
> 2) Appearing on CNN's Larry King Live on Monday July 1,
Eleanor Clift offered this explanation as to who is to blame for 
the Gary Aldrich book: "One thing we haven't really mentioned is
the people who are surrounding Mr. Aldrich and in fact they are
members of what I would call the right-wing mafia. I mean they
were there for Paula Jones and they are fueling a lot of what we
hear on hate radio." MRC analyst Geoffrey Dickens found thatquote.
<p>
> 3) MRC analyst Steve Kaminski caught this conclusion to
Newsweek Senior Editor Joe Klein's July 8 piece on filegate: "But
if Clinton does survive this pounding, it may mean the revulsion
against the `-gate' phenomenon -- 20 years of ever-diminishing
scandals -- is now more intense than the disgust caused by any
individual charge. If so, it would be the President's most
memorable public service." 
<p>
    Funny how he didn't feel that way until the scandals hit a
Democratic President.
<p>
    > 4) After summarizing Bill Clinton's attack on Dole over the
assault weapons ban, on the July 10 NBC Nightly News reporter Jim
Miklaszewski proceeded to review the controversy over Bob Dole
not addressing the NAACP convention. Here's the last two-thirds
of his Wednesday night story as transcribed by MRC intern Jessica Anderson:
<p>
Miklaszewski: "No doubt this was a Clinton crowd. That comes as
no surprise to Bob Dole. Dole had been invited to speak to the
convention yesterday, but declined. He claimed he was already
committed to campaigning and the All-Star baseball game. To those
at this convention that was quite a stretch and an insult to
African-American voters."
<p>
[Woman at NAACP convention: "When you want to be President of the
United States of America, you cannot afford to write any American
off."]
<p>
Miklaszewski: "Back in Washington, Dole's Democratic critics had
a field day."
<p>
[Rep. John Conyers, Jr., (D) Michigan: "He's saying, 'I don't
care about the black vote in November,' and I think that the
black vote in November will not care about him."]
<p>
Miklaszewski: "That already appears to be the case. The latest
NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll shows Clinton has a lock on the
African-American vote; only five percent would vote for Bob Dole.
[On-screen visual shows Clinton with 87 percent and Dole with
five percent, plus or minus seven percentage points.] But even
Colin Powell believes that Dole should have made an appearance."
<p>
[Gen. Colin Powell (Ret.): "I wish he didn't have a scheduling
conflict. I think it would have been useful for him to present
his views to the NAACP."]
<p>
Miklaszewski: "It would have been a tough crowd."
<p>
[Anonymous man: "I think he made the right move he didn't come
because perhaps he might get booed."]
<p>
Miklaszewski: "Nevertheless, by not showing up here, Bob Dole may
reinforce those racial divides along party lines and fuel the
anxiety among some Republicans that in this presidential campaign
Bob Dole may not be up to the challenge. Jim Miklaszewski, NBC
News, Charlotte."
<p>
So, when Bill Clinton fails to address a Christian Coalition
convention that's an insult to all Christians? -- Brent Baker

<h3>Taxes vs. Cuts; Carlson Hypocrisy; NBC's Victims</h3>
</center>
<p>
July 11, 1996
<p>
<b>Four items today:</b>
<ul>
<li>Some real bias in Katie Couric's interview with Bob Dole that
got lost in the publicity over smoking. She sees tax cuts and
budget balancing as contradictory.
<li>Time magazine's Margaret Carlson blasts her industry for
publicizing the Gary Aldrich book, but a bit of hypocrisy comes
through when you look at an article she wrote in 1985.
<li>NBC Nightly News discovers and cries over a new class of
"victims" -- those who don't get paid for overtime.
<li>Asked to rate the media's bias from right to left on a scale
of 0 to ten, Eleanor Clift puts the media right in the middle.
</ul>
> 1) The now famous Today exchange about smoking took place
in part two of a three part interview. On the first day, July 1,
Katie Couric displayed the conventional media wisdom about tax
cuts and balancing the budget: you can have one but not the
other. Here are her challenges to Bob Dole as he tries to explain
how he'll achieve both:<br>
    -- "So you don't support across the board tax cuts?"<br>
    -- "What's more important to you, tax cuts or balancing the
budget, if you had to choose?"<br>
    -- "If you had to pick one?"
<p>
     > 2) Margaret Carlson opened her July 15 Time column on
attention to the Gary Aldrich book by charging that "the press
has caught Mad Lie disease, marked by a loss of appetite for the
truth and projectile regurgitation of anything fed to it." In her
last paragraph, she wrote: "There was a time when by common
agreement a book like Aldrich's would die for lack of oxygen. Now
the mainstream media strive to get every sensational rumor 'in
play.'"
<p>    
Well, as MediaWatch Associate Editor Tim Graham reminded me,
let's flip through Carlson's clip book. The July 1989 MediaWatch
quoted this paragraph from Carlson's November 1985 article in
Esquire magazine previewing the 1988 Republican contenders:
<p>
"What one does in Washington behind closed doors generally
stays out of the paper. But the persistent rumor that one of the
potential 1988 presidential candidates has a homosexual past is
testing the unacknowledged code of silence among reporters."
<p>
   > 3) On Tuesday night (July 9), the day the Senate passed a
minimum wage increase bill, Tom Brokaw announced that "the Labor
Department has discovered that millions of American workers are
being shortchanged on another front: overtime. They're working it, but they're not getting the dividend." As transcribed by MRC
intern Jessica Anderson, here are some excerpts from the story
that should have generated little sympathy from those with
salaried jobs.
<p>   
Reporter Mike Jensen began by talking with Becky Perkins who
"raises two children and works long hours as a parole officer in
Texas." She explained: "There's no way you can leave at 5:00. I
mean, you're staying there 'til six, seven, eight, doing just
paperwork alone, not to mention going out into the field to make
home visits."
<p>   
But, Jensen reported, "In spite of the long hours, the state
refused to pay Becky overtime, but the U.S. Labor Department
investigated. It said money was owed, that Becky had been
shortchanged....Workers like Becky are gypped out of an estimated
$20 billion a year in unpaid overtime. The worst offenders?
Construction companies, garment factories, toy makers, auto
repair shops, and food stores. Hundreds of thousands of victims
and very few complaints, says attorney Joan Keyok" [spelling
approximated].
<p>    
Following a soundbite from her, Jensen returned to the
"victim" theme: "Many of the victims are minimum wage workers
afraid of being fired, or immigrants who don't know their rights,
or older workers concerned about downsizing. They never see the
time and a half pay that's legally theirs."
<p>
    > 4) On a 0-10 scale of media bias from right wing to left
wing bias where does Eleanor Clift place the media? Here's her
answer from McLaughlin Group last weekend: "The press is right in
the middle. It's a five. The bias is for bad news."
<p>
    Another sign of progress: Not even a committed liberal like
Clift dares to say anymore that the media are biased to the
right. -- Brent Baker

<b>Top Ten & Dan on Castro's Health</b>
<p>
Two bits of humor today:
<p>
    1) David Letterman's Top Ten list from Friday night: "Top Ten
Revelations In The New Tell-All Book About The White House."
<p>
    2) Dan Rather asks Fidel Castro the question on everyone's
mind -- about a certain organ.
<p>
    > 1) Downloaded from CompuServe's E-Drive, here's the June 28

<p>
<b>Top Ten Revelations In The New Tell-All Book About The White

<p>
9. Sometimes Bill skips the fries and just starts chugging the
Wesson Oil
<p>
8. Mattress in Lincoln bedroom is stuffed with shredded

<p>
1. Bill's original choice for drug czar: Robert Downey, Jr.
<p>
     > 2) CBS Reports: The Last Revolutionary, a documentary on

Nevertheless, the newsman asked the dictator, whose 37 years in
power ranks second only to Jordan's King Hussein: 'Prostate OK?'
<p>
    'OK,' replied Castro, who turns 70 in August."

<Title>Kudos: Sesno Challenges Rivlin, Daschle</Title>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<center><h2>Kudos: Sesno Challenges Rivlin, Daschle</h2>
</center>
<p>
Many in the media have accepted, and passed on as fact, the Democrats' party line that Republicans were out to cut and even destroy Medicare. CNN's Frank Sesno, on the December 17 Late Edition, set the record straight.
<p>
He first interviewed President Clinton's budget director, Alice Rivlin. Sesno confronted Rivlin with the facts: "Take Medicare, for example. You said, the President, rather, yesterday said, `They would let Medicare wither on the vine into a second class citizen.' Now, you don't really believe that the Republicans are going to let Medicare wither on the vine? They're not talking about that. And as you well know, and as they say as many times as they are able, even with their cuts in the rate of growth of the program, it still grows into an ever larger piece of the pie."
<p>
When Rivlin balked at such an analysis, Sesno remained adamant. "In the interest of truth in advertising here, do you really believe that the Speaker of the House and the Majority Leader of the Senate want to destroy Medicare?" he asked. "Isn't this part of the Mediscare debate that your critics accuse you of engaging in?"
<p>
After Rivlin, Sesno interviewed Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle (along with GOP Senator Trent Lott). He pointed out to Daschle that "in the health care reform debate, of not very long ago, of which you were a part, there was a great deal of talk that expenses had to be controlled. You had something called global budgeting. I mean you were going to hold everybody down. So why is it unfair to do that in the case of Medicare?"
<p>
Later, when Senator Daschle called the Republican plan to slow Medicare's growth "the biggest cuts in the history of Medicare. Biggest by far. Three times more than has ever been proposed." Sesno corrected him: "Biggest cuts in the rate of growth of Medicare, not absolute cuts."
<p>
Kudos to Sesno for giving Democratic rhetoric the same scrutiny reporters usually reserve for Republicans.

<Title>Issue Review: Federal Funding of Public Broadcasting</Title>
</Head>
<Body BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<center><h2>Issue Review: Federal Funding of Public Broadcasting</h2>
<p>
<h3>Donations Rise as Funding Threatened</h3>
</center>
<p>
At this time last year, leaders of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), Public Television (PTV), and National Public Radio (NPR) were calling their viewers and listeners stingy. Not in so many words, of course, but that was in effect their argument when they warned that they would not be able to make up any cut in or elimination of public broadcasting's federal subsidy.
Conservatives, looking at history, argued that when taxes were cut (as Republicans planned), people gave more to organizations they support, including public broadcasting, and that if people truly liked public broadcasting, they would not let it die.
<p>
<b>Who was right?</b><br>
Looking at the results of last year's public broadcasting pledge drives, as reported in the Public Broadcasting Report, it looks like conservatives were correct. Even without a tax cut, merely the threat of cutting public broadcasting's subsidy spurred massive increases in private donations early in the year. Later, when it was clear that the federal subsidy would be kept, donations began to level off.
<p>
Conservatives, in making their arguments, were standing on strong historical ground. During the 1980s, when tax rates were cut, individual donations to public television, for example, increased every year. In fiscal year 1980 there were 2.6 million members of PTV who gave an average contribution of $29.96 for a total of almost $78 million. By fiscal year 1989 the number of members had doubled (to 5.2 million) and the average contribution had increased steadily (to $50.38), giving public television a total of $262 million from individual members. In fiscal year 1991, after the Bush tax increase, the number of individual public television members dropped to 5.07 million.
<p>
Last year, when Republicans in Congress threatened to eliminate or substantially cut public broadcasting's federal subsidy, donations skyrocketed. The first bit of good news came in February. KCRW-FM in Santa Monica, California announced that it had set a record for on-air fundraising by a public radio station in its February 6-14 winter subscription drive. According to the Public Broadcasting Report (PBR), the station "raised $1.09 million from 14,314 new and renewing subscribers," a 26 percent increase over the previous year. General manager Ruth Seymour told PBR that the debate over federal funding spurred the massive increase: "I think our audience understands that we are committed to the effort to keep public radio noncommercial."
<p>
Then public television stations began to note a striking increase in donations. PBR told its readers on March 24 that "PTV stations across the country reported very successful spring pledge drives." The Arkansas Educational Television Network, for example surpassed its $350,000 goal despite reducing the time spent in pledge breaks by ten percent. KRMA-TV in Denver and WETA-TV in Washington, D.C. had record-breaking drives, with KRMA reporting a 13 percent increase over 1994 totals and WETA garnering almost $1 million from 12,600 pledges, 62 percent of which were from new members. KCET in Los Angeles finished its spring pledge drive with $1.68 million, exceeding its March, 1994 drive, which lasted three days longer, by $205,127.
<p>
Nationwide, PBR reported, the number of pledges for March were "12.9 percent above March 1994 returns" and the total dollars pledged were up 15.3 percent. Public radio had similar success. According to PBR, "on average, stations did 15-40 percent better during this drive than they did during last year's campaign." The public radio stations that did "only" 15-20 percent better than the previous year were "those who stopped once they reached their goals."
<p>
The momentum was sustained through the summer. PBR reported on August 25 that "indications are that the August PTV pledge drive will be another hit in a year of overwhelmingly successful campaigns that many have attributed to publicity involving projected federal budget cuts." The number of pledges had increased a dramatic 18 percent over the previous August and pledge dollars were up 16 percent.
<p>
By December, though, when it had become clear that Republicans were not going to eliminate federal funding for public broadcasting, or even cut it substantially, pledge growth slowed. The December pledge drive, according to PBR, collected seven percent more than the December 1994 pledge drive, a healthy increase, but not at the level of the astronomical increases of March and August.
<p>
The moral of the story: Viewers value public broadcasting enough to increase their donations when federal funding is threatened. But when it's clear the government will pay for it, they don't feel the need to pay as much.
<p>
This should reassure public broadcasting executives. During last year's debate, they didn't express much confidence in their supporters. CPB Chairman Henry Cauthen predicted that if federal funding were foregone, 87 public television stations would have to be closed down. (He didn't point out, of course that this would still give PBS more television stations than ABC, CBS, or NBC.)
Public Broadcasting Service president Ervin S. Duggan told TV Guide: "I don't think public TV could survive and maintain its mandate without federal funding. Survival would come at a cost of becoming commercial. We'd be driven by ratings, not quality."
<p>
As the debate continued Duggan became so convinced that individuals wouldn't ante up support for a privatized PBS that he began to speak in harsh tones about the future of the network, comparing privatized television to prostitution. He worried that "commercialized public television is likely to resemble, for all the world, Thomas Hardy's ruined maid: `no longer pure and simple, brazenly working the streets in her new commercial finery, doing whatever necessary to survive.'"
<p>
The evidence suggests Cauthen and Duggan were wrong. When federal funding decreases, private funding increases. If members of Congress really want to strengthen public broadcasting, then they should wean it from the federal government and cut taxes.

<p>
<h3>Lamenting Layoffs, Ignoring Job Rise</h3>
</center>
<p>
The current wave of layoffs at several large companies seems to confirm in many reporters' minds their view of how the business world works: Corporate America racks up record profits for wealthy shareholders while laying off millions of workers.
<p>
That's how the networks have reported the layoffs. But with a little digging these reporters could have found that corporate profits are not unusually high, that shareholders are not just rich people, and that more jobs are being created than destroyed.
<p>
Anchor John Roberts set the tone of the layoff coverage on the December 26 CBS Evening News: "The market has been hitting one record high after another. But as Economics Correspondent Ray Brady reports, many workers have paid a heavy price." Brady then interviewed "ex-Wall Streeter" Michael Thomas, who told viewers what he seemed to think was shocking: "Executives are running companies exclusively for their stockholders."
<p>
This focus on the interests of stockholders, Brady explained, has meant layoffs at such established companies as 3M and AT&T, which caused their stock prices to jump. "Who pays the price for this stock market prosperity?" Brady asked. "Come to any job center, where laid off middle managers scramble desperately for work. Corporate America announced more than 41,000 layoffs last month alone, up 45 percent over the same month a year ago."
<p>
Martha Teichner, Brady's colleague at CBS, joined the chorus on the January 7 Sunday Morning. "For all of 1995, the figure was nearly 450,000, but, hey, that's the good news. In 1993 it was 615,000," Teichner reported. "Here's a statistic for our leaner and meaner times. Since 1980, Fortune 500 companies, America's biggest and most profitable corporations, announced layoffs of more than eight million people. That's like laying off the entire population of New York City."
<p>
Over at NBC, on the January 4 Nightly News, Mike Jensen agreed. After saying that some companies had to downsize in order to survive, he said, "Some companies simply decided to make more money by firing people. Corporate profits totalled about $400 billion last year, up 25 percent. What all those companies did was obliterate one of the keystones of the American Dream, the security of a job for life. They created anxiety for everyone, even those who didn't get fired."
<p>
But just how high are corporate profits? According to the January 4 Investor's Business Daily, which quoted a study by the Employment Policy Foundation, corporate "profits have dropped from an average of 12 percent of national output in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s to about 9 percent currently -- a decline of about 25 percent in profits' share of total output."
<p>
About those supposedly greedy stockholders, the newspaper pointed out that they may not be who viewers were led to believe they were: "With more than half of all Americans now owning stocks through retirement, mutual, and individual shareholder accounts, it is the average American who benefits most from corporate profits -- not some fat cat on Wall Street."
<p>
And here's a statistic for Teichner: "Little noticed among the repeated headlines of Fortune 500 firms cutting jobs are the literally thousands of small and medium-sized firms that are adding new workers at a frenetic pace. Since the start of 1994, more than five million new jobs have been created in the U.S. economy -- more than enough to sop up all the new entrants in the work force."
<p>
Reporters seem to think the entire business world begins and ends with the Fortune 500. Until they start looking at the entire economy, they won't be able to tell the entire story.

<CENTER><H3>A Flat Tax Fact Sheet</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
Virtually every Republican presidential candidate has endorsed some version of 
the flat tax, as has the Kemp Tax Reform Commission. This support is mirrored 
by public opinion, with polls showing anywhere between one-half and two-thirds 
of taxpayers prefer the flat tax over the current system. Needless to say, with 
all this attention, it comes as no surprise that many in the media have begun 
writing about and describing this revolutionary proposal. Unfortunately, this 
new-found publicity has been accompanied by frequent errors. In order to 
maintain accuracy, reporters should avoid these two most common mistakes:
<P>
Mistake #1: Many reporters write that the flat tax contains a huge loophole for 
the rich because they have trouble understanding how income is taxed under a 
flat tax. This error shows up in several ways. Some report that dividend and 
interest income is tax free. Others write that only labor income is taxed.
<P>
Reality: The source of these common mistakes is that the most well-known 
versions of the flat tax collect taxes on capital income at the source. Under 
the Armey- Shelby flat tax, for instance, a corporation must pay tax on behalf 
of shareholders before the income is distributed in the form of dividends. This 
approach, which reduces administrative costs and ensures greater compliance, 
makes a dividend check similar to a worker's paycheck in that both are 
after-tax payments. The same is true for interest income. Under the flat tax, 
businesses and financial institutions pay tax on interest payments they make, 
so there is no need to collect the tax a second time at the individual level. 
Once again, the motive for taking this approach is simplicity and compliance.
<P>
Message: Reporters can argue that the tax should be collected at the individual 
level. They can even argue that the income should be subjected to two or more 
layers of tax. Honesty demands, however, that they acknowledge that all income 
is taxed with a flat tax, but only taxed once, and that tax is collected in the 
least costly fashion possible.
<P>
Mistake #2: The flat tax will increase the deficit and/or boost taxes on the 
middle class. Many news reports assume that a flat tax will require a tax rate 
of 21 percent or more to offset reductions in excessive tax rates on the rich. 
Even with the generous personal allowance, this tax rate would adversely affect 
the middle class. Failure to levy a rate that high, on the other hand, would 
cause larger deficits.
<P>
Reality: With a 17 percent rate, the Armey-Shelby flat tax explicitly is 
designed to reduce the amount of money the government collects. As a result, 
even without making any assumptions about faster economic growth expanding the 
tax base (the supply-side effect), it is possible for all income classes to 
enjoy a lower tax burden. With regards to the deficit, the plan imposes strict 
new limits on government spending. Enforced by automatic spending control 
mechanisms, this ensures that the deficit will not climb. The key principle is 
that the flat tax is accompanied by spending savings to keep the overall 
package deficit-neutral.
<P>
Message: Conclusions that the middle class is harmed are based on analysis of a 
revenue-neutral tax proposal which does not exist. Reporters can condemn the 
proposal for reducing the amount of money the government collects, and they can 
write that the growth of government would have to be significantly slowed to 
keep the plan deficit neutral as sponsors propose, but it is inaccurate to 
assert that the middle class will pay more or that the deficit will increase.
<P>
With help from biased sources such as the Clinton Treasury Department and the 
union-funded Citizens for Tax Justice, many reporters have unwittingly (we 
hope) made one of these mistakes. Some, like Al Hunt of  The Wall Street 
Journal and Ann Reilly Dowd of Money, have made both mistakes in the same 
article. Fair and accurate reporting depends on the public receiving 
information in a straight- forward fashion. Avoiding these two mistakes will 
help ensure the upcoming tax debate is marked by legitimate policy issues 
rather than distorted media messages.

<h3>Reporters Crash, Viewers Burned</h3>
</center>
<p>
Just when you think reporters couldn't get any more hostile to industry, they do. Consider two mid-January television reports on ABC's Good Morning America and NBC Nightly News. Both stories contain mistakes which often plague reports about automobile safety, and both ignored the trade-offs safety regulations inevitably require. 
<p>
At issue were federal standards for rear guards on tractor trailers. These "U"-shaped metal rods are specifically intended to keep cars that hit the rear of a truck from riding under it. The regulatory standard for the guards has been set at 30 inches from the ground for the past fifty years, although the voluntary industry standard has been 22 inches for several years. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) merely codified this standard with the cooperation of the trucking industry.
<p>
That's the news part. But reporters portrayed this issue as a grand conflict, with industry as a hostile force and supposedly-impartial "consumer advocates" as society's protectors. The question for reporters was how to criticize industry without panning the government in a situation where both agreed. Here's how they answered it:
<p>
Neither report mentioned that industry was already producing 22-inch guards. ABC's Lisa Stark, on the January 19 Good Morning America, reported that "under the new standard, rear guards...must be lowered to 22 inches above the ground. They're now at 30 inches." Tom Brokaw stated in his introduction to the January 17 NBC Nightly News segment, "The government is about to take an action that should save lives." Robert Hager was more explicit in the NBC segment, saying that the government will require new tractor trailers "to be made with big rods on the back, bigger than any currently in use."
Neither report pointed out that most tractor trailers already have the 22-inch guards -- voluntarily.
<p>
Hager employed questionable data. "Nearly 700 [people] a year die in [ride-under] accidents," he declared. But both NHTSA and the trucking industry put the number of deaths at 60 each year. (ABC's Lisa Stark used the NHTSA figure.)
<p>
Both reports projected skepticism of the new standard -- but not of the government -- as insufficiently stringent without offering evidence. In Stark's report, Gerald Donaldson of Citizens for Reliable & Safe Highways (CRASH) stated that the new rule "was not selected on the basis of what would really be a big contribution to improving public safety... [but] on the basis of what the trucking industry would buy into."
<p>
The ubiquitous Joan Claybrook, representing CRASH in Hager's report, said, "We don't think this rule makes significant enough changes....Very few people are going to be protected under this standard." Hager didn't ask Claybrook why, if she was so concerned, she never acted on the rear guard issue when she was head of NHTSA from 1977-1981.
<p>
Neither report was skeptical of these supposedly objective "consumer advocates." The media look at funding only when it comes to industry associations or conservative advocates. That's why we hear about "tobacco-funded groups," but not "trial-lawyer-funded groups." The fact that a group is funded by parties who have a stake in certain outcomes does not necessarily mean that what they say is incorrect. Still, it would have been interesting if the reporters had asked who funds CRASH; they would have discovered that CRASH is substantially funded by the railroad industry.
<p>
Regulations intended to increase safety by decreasing one risk often backfire by creating new risks. For example, the risk of keeping the rear guard at 22 inches means that some small cars could still slip under the truck. But making the rear guard lower means that trucks could get caught on railroad grade crossings or have difficulty maneuvering around rail yards and ports, causing different kinds of accidents. ABC touched on this issue dismissively; NBC only mentioned the dollar cost of the changes.
<p>
When it comes to government regulation of safety, even the most skeptical reporters become true believers. Too eager to criticize industry, and too receptive to "consumer groups" which invariably advocate more government regulation, reporters often believe that we can have more safety at no cost. But overlooking the trade-offs involved in government regulation does not help anyone, and could, in fact, be deadly. Who pays this price? The very people reporters are trying to inform: consumers.

<center><h2>Issue Analysis: Forbes Proposal Draws Media Fire</h2>
<p>
<h3>A Bumpy Road for the Flat Tax</h3>
</center>
<p>
The newest rage on the political scene is the flat tax. It has propelled the presidential candidacy of Republican Steve Forbes, causing most of the other GOP candidates to formulate a version of their own. The flat tax is a simple tax system with complex arguments both for it and against it. Covering such an issue is, therefore, a difficult task. To be fair and balanced, reporters at the very least must present the best arguments for it and against it. But so far, the best arguments for the flat tax have rarely made the news.
<p>
Media Research Center analysts reviewed all of the flat-tax stories on network evening news shows (ABC World News Tonight, NBC Nightly News, CBS Evening News) and in national news magazines (Newsweek, Time, U.S. News & World Report) during the month of January. There were 16 stories which presented arguments for or against the flat tax. (There were more about the Forbes campaign generally.) In those 16 stories, arguments against the flat tax were presented 51 times, while arguments in favor of the flat tax were presented only 24 times.
<p>
Double Taxation. The argument against the flat tax most often presented -- 24 times in the 16 stories -- was that it would not tax interest income or investment income, and thus overly benefit the wealthy. For example, ABC's Dean Reynolds, on the January 29 World News Tonight, said the Forbes flat tax would mean "no taxes on inherited wealth or stock portfolios." Newsweek's Marc Levinson and Rich Thomas contended that "investment income would be tax-free." According to Peter Jennings, on the January 15 World News Tonight, "There would be no capital gains tax, no tax on interest earned at the bank, or for money you've made through investments. A millionaire living solely on dividends or inherited money wouldn't have to pay any tax."
<p>
Only twice did a reporter point out that such a millionaire, under a flat tax, would in fact be taxed. Flat-tax proponents argue that investment income would indeed be taxed, but only at the corporate or bank level. As the Heritage Foundation's Dan Mitchell wrote in the January MediaNomics, under the flat tax "a corporation must pay tax on behalf of shareholders before the income is distributed in the form of dividends." Flat-tax proponents argue that, as in the case of withholding, savers and investors currently get less money because it has already been taxed, but still must pay an additional income tax on the money. Only Newsweek's Allan Sloan, in an anti-flat tax article, pointed out that currently "some [income], like corporate dividends, is in effect taxed twice."
<p>
Mortgage Interest. The next most common argument against the flat tax was that the elimination of the mortgage interest deduction would hurt the middle class. Reporters cited such arguments 13 times in the 16 stories. According to the January 15 U.S. News & World Report, "Homeowners could see home values drop if mortgage interest payments and property taxes were no longer deductible." On the January 15 World News Tonight, Peter Jennings weighed in on the issue by only mentioning one side: "President Clinton believes that middle class homeowners will see the value of their homes go down if there is no mortgage deduction."
<p>
Reporters mentioned counterarguments to such claims only three times. For instance, Bob Schieffer, on the January 20 CBS Evening News, said, "Forbes counters those arguments by saying the deduction won't be needed because homeowners will pay less in taxes, which will cause the economy to grow, which will cause interest rates overall to go down." No reporter mentioned that the deduction is actually regressive. John Berthoud of the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution pointed out in the January 31 Investor's Business Daily that "80 percent of the break's tax benefits go to those with incomes over $50,000."
<p>
Federal Deficit. Twelve times reporters cited the claim of flat-tax opponents that the flat tax would greatly increase the federal deficit. NBC's Mike Jensen, on the January 17 Nightly News, claimed that "the biggest loser would be the government. With a 17-percent flat tax, critics say the budget deficit could double." According to Jensen: "For poor and middle class families, critics say the 17 percent flat tax is a cruel hoax, that to avoid big deficits, it would have to be much higher than 17 percent."
<p>
Echoing Jensen, ABC's John Cochran, on the January 19 World News Tonight, said that "Forbes' opponents still say his version of the flat tax won't work, that it would increase the budget deficit at a time when Republicans are trying to eliminate it." U.S. News & World Report agreed: "The Treasury Department estimates that a flat-tax rate would need to be set at 21 percent -- not 17 percent -- to raise the same level of revenues as the current income-tax system does. Without raising this rate, the federal government would see its budget deficit rise, and this would add to Washington's fiscal woes."
<p>
Only half as many times -- six -- did reporters give the counterargument that the flat tax would not increase the federal deficit. Time's Dan Goodgame, for example, wrote that Forbes "assumes that tax cuts, even when financed by federal borrowing, will generate so much economic growth that they will quickly wipe out the deficit." Goodgame, though, dismissed such a belief as a "quasi-theology."
<p>
Noting that Forbes' 17 percent rate might be a revenue-loser for the government, some reporters wondered how Forbes would make up the shortfall. Newsweek's Allen Sloan asked: "How will he fill the gap? With economic growth and spending cuts. Details? Forbes isn't saying." Time's Goodgame criticized Forbes because he "declines to specify spending he would cut." It's true that Forbes has not been specific about spending cuts. But then reporters rarely give such reprimands to politicians who oppose slowing entitlement growth, but decline to specify how much taxes will then have to increase. Why the double standard for Forbes?
<p>
Charitable Contributions. Twice reporters mentioned the argument that a flat tax would hurt charities by removing the deduction for charitable contributions. According to ABC's Peter Jennings, on the January 15 World News Tonight, "Charities worry about how generous folks will be if their contribution is no longer deductible." The January 15 U.S. News & World Report similarly warned that "charities could lose donations if contributions were no longer deductible."
<p>
No reporter mentioned the counterargument that charities would not be hurt by a flat tax. John Berthoud's Investor's Business Daily article points out that "of $117 billion donated [to charities] in 1991, $56 billion came from non-itemizers. Of the $61 billion that was deducted, 54 percent came from Americans in low-to-moderate tax brackets. Thus, three of four dollars given to charity don't lead to a substantial tax benefit." Berthoud further noted that "top marginal tax rates dropped from 70 percent in 1980 to 28 percent in 1988, thus robbing the deduction of more than half its value. And the deduction for non-itemizers was eliminated in 1986. Yet charitable contributions rose" at a record pace.
<p>
Flat Tax Favorables. Only two arguments in favor of the flat tax -- its simplicity and its closing of loopholes -- were reported thoroughly. Seven times reporters made the case that the flat tax would make the tax code simpler. CBS's Bob Schieffer, on the January 20 CBS Evening News, pointed out "the simplicity of the plan. No accountants needed to tell you what you owe. No long forms to fill out." Six times reporters pointed out that the flat tax would close loopholes for special interests. Joe Klein, for instance, on the January 21 CBS Evening News, said: "[Forbes'] is a anti-Washington campaign, and that's how he sells the flat tax. He says, `I'll eliminate a whole lobbying industry, the industry that gets tax loopholes for special interests.' And that's the advantage of the flat tax."
<p>
But those were the exceptions. Most of the time arguments against the flat tax were presented without arguments in its favor meriting a mention. At times reporters, such as Newsweek's Allan Sloan, didn't try to hide their fondness for the politics of envy: "Taxing investment income at both the corporate and personal levels, as it's taxed now, may not be sound economics. But it's reasonably sound social policy, considering that most investment income flows to upper-income people." Sloan didn't mention that many investments, such as those in pension funds and mutual funds, are made by the middle class. 
<p>
At other times the opposition to the flat tax became absurd. NBC's Mike Jensen managed to find a middle class couple who claimed that the $3,146 tax cut they would get under the Forbes plan "is really not going to change our lives."
For such a simple policy, the arguments over the flat tax are quite complicated. Still, reporters should not bring up the arguments of flat-tax opponents unless they're willing to give flat-tax supporters a chance to respond.

<Title>Network Assumes Private Money Is Corrupt, Ignores Conservative Argument</Title>

<center><h2>Network Assumes Private Money Is Corrupt, Ignores Conservative Argument</h2>
<p>
<h3>ABC's Missing Campaign Reform Idea</h3>
</center>
<p>
Is there too much money in politics? That question is a rhetorical one for much of the media. They simply assume that there is. So far this campaign season, network newscasts have reported numerous times about the costs of running a presidential campaign and the alleged problems this raises for candidates. Because reporters assume private money hurts politics, they report on every reform option except the one conservatives champion -- raising (or eliminating) the limits on individual donations to candidates.
<p>
Case in point: ABC News. On January 17 and 18 ABC's World News Tonight devoted a total of five stories to the role of money in the presidential campaign, under the title "The Greenback Primary." These stories followed a January 15 Nightline broadcast about campaign-finance reform. The assumption in all of these stories was that money has -- as Peter Jennings put it -- a "corrosive effect" on the political process.
<p>
Various correspondents contributed to the World News Tonight series. Jim Wooten pointed out that front-loaded primaries meant candidates have to raise a lot of money early. "None of the Republicans except Senator Dole has actually reached his fundraising goal," Wooten reported. "He's ahead. There could be a connection." John Donvan illustrated the elaborate means candidates must employ to raise enough money to compete. Bill Blakemore noted the rise of "soft money," such as contributions to political parties and independ-ent expenditures. According to Blakemore: "It's how corporations and unions can snub the law that forbids them to give to presidential campaigns."
<p>
While many of these stories were informative, none questioned the common wisdom that too much money is the problem with the current campaign finance system. None cited the mainstream conservative argument, made by law professor Bradley Smith in a Cato Institute study, that more money would improve politics. Smith wrote: "Considering the importance of elections to any democratic society, it is hard to believe that the expenditure of less than $10 per voter for all local, state, and national campaigns constitutes a crisis requiring government regulation and limitations on spending."
<p>
Ignoring this argument led to biased coverage of possible reforms. On the January 15 Nightline, Jeff Greenfield reported, "We'll be hearing a torrent of words about campaign-finance reform this year, but every proposal for change raises some big questions. Complete public financing? Well, skeptical voters might see that as just another taxpayer rip-off. Force television stations to provide free air time? Who would qualify and who wouldn't? Say to multi-millionaires they can't spend as much as they want on their own campaigns? No, the Supreme Court says that would be unconstitutional."
<p>
While Greenfield skillfully raised objections to all the reform ideas he cited, he didn't mention "every proposal for change." David Frum, in the January 15 Weekly Standard, suggested one proposal conservatives have long advocated -- "a sharp increase in the maximum permissible personal donation." Frum argued that "if [candidates] could raise their money in bigger chunks, they could spend much less time at the task" and that "once large donations could be made directly to the candidate -- which every candidate prefers -- the evil of unaccountable and undisclosed soft money would tend to wither away."
<p>
Reporters are correct to sense that something is wrong with the campaign-finance system. And the liberal view that private money always corrupts political campaigns should be reported fairly. But journalists shouldn't assume liberals are right and report liberal reform plans as if they were the only ones being proposed.

<title>Reporters Don't Challenge Politicians on Anti-Green Subsidies</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Easy on Government Pollution</h2>
</center>
<p>
When the media report on the environment, which will no doubt be a big issue in the upcoming presidential campaign, they almost always employ the same formula. Private industry is portrayed as the cause of all environmental problems; government is portrayed as the protector of the public. This formula ignores one big cause of environ- mental problems -- federal agriculture subsidies, which not only hurt taxpayers and consumers, but also finance environmental destruction.
<p>
Example: recent coverage of the Clinton Administration's proposal to try to restore parts of the Florida Everglades. Most reporters accepted at face value the Clinton plan, which would increase the tax on sugar by a penny per pound to pay for a $1.5 billion program that includes the federal government buying and restoring land in the Everglades.
<p>
According to CBS This Morning's Jane Robelot, on February 20, "The Clinton Administration has announced ambitious plans to save the Everglades from further ecological destruction by raising the tax on sugar." Correspondent Art Rascon continued: "It's the largest infusion of federal dollars ever proposed for the Everglades, making it one of the biggest ecological restoration projects ever."
<p>
Newsweek's Miami correspondent Peter Katel, in the March 4 issue, added that "Clinton's plan is the high-water mark of reform. Senator Majority Leader Bob Dole and Florida's two senators have a more modest plan to spend $200 million of taxpayer funds -- not sugar  money -- to buy some of the sugarcane land for water-restoration projects." Mike Clary of the Los Angeles Times wrote on February 20 that "the administration's seven-year plan to save one of the most endangered ecosystems in the United States is as ambitious and comprehensive as any environmental project of recent years, environmentalists say."
<p>
And according to ABC's Barry Serafin, on the February 19 World News Tonight, "Administration officials say the [sugar] industry, which enjoys generous price supports must pay its fair share, a view shared by many in South Florida, who are determined to bring back the state's fabled river of grass."
<p>
Although none of these reporters were wrong, and a few even pointed out the huge federal subsidy sugar gets from high tariffs, none asked why the government shouldn't simply stop subsidizing sugar. The Competitive Enterprise Institute's Jonathan Tolman told MediaNomics that if the government simply "brought down the tariff wall on sugar, it would discourage overfarming of sugar near the Everglades and make land there less expensive, which would make Gore's program to buy the land less expensive." In addition, no reporter brought up another point Tolman makes: "The Clinton tax increase on sugar will be passed on to consumers in the form of higher prices."
<p>
Only Eric Schmitt of the New York Times, in a February 29 article about price supports, made the connection between the government subsidies and environmental damage. Schmitt pointed out that "under the sugar program...the government sets price supports that maintain domestic sugar prices at twice those on the world market and, according to the General Accounting Office, cost consumers $1.4 billion a year. Strict quotas on cheaper foreign sugar maintain the support price levels, which critics say benefit a small number of wealthy plantation owners and encourage overproduction in environmentally sensitive areas like the Florida Everglades."
<p>
But Schmitt was the exception among national reporters. Most reporters chose to challenge neither Clinton nor Republicans on why they maintain a subsidy that hurts consumers, taxpayers, and the environment.

<title>Issue Analysis: Networks Report Only One Side of Employment Picture</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Media Lay Off New Jobs Story</h2>
</center>
<p>
Most economists argue that layoffs and a certain amount of job insecurity are part of a healthy, competitive economy. Joseph Schumpeter labeled the process of new technologies replacing workers and new companies displacing established companies "creative destruction." While such a competitive economy isn't always pleasant for those who are temporarily out of work, most economists say it undeniably creates a more prosperous economy for all.
<p>
But most economists are never interviewed by network news reporters. The result is that, for the most part, viewers are told only about the destructiveness of a competitive economy and not job creation. Media Research Center analysts reviewed every story about employment on network evening news shows (ABC's World News Tonight, CBS Evening News, CNN's World News, and NBC Nightly News) during January and February. Of the 21 stories, 19 focused on corporate layoffs and downsizing. Only two highlighted parts of the economy where jobs are plentiful. And while there were eleven soundbites from politicians, there was only one soundbite from an economist.
<p>
Tom Brokaw, on the January 29 Nightly News, expressed the typical tone. Introducing a story about "today's frightening job market," he said, "Job security is a thing of the past now and the way of the future is downsizing and layoffs, even for America's biggest companies. It's making for serious anxiety. A recent poll in New York state shows a third of the workers fearful they or someone in their household will lose their job, and soon. And with good reason. Last year there were more than 400,000 announced layoffs across the country, bringing the three-year total to 1.5 million."
<p>
Dan Rather, on the February 22 CBS Evening News, gave a similar diagnosis: "Millions of American workers know it. Despite soaring profits and a record Wall Street, U.S. businesses are still cutting good jobs and barely raising wages." According to Rather, "Republican Pat Buchanan has hit a nerve with his rhetoric about this. He is connecting with real anger and fear in the workplace."
<p>
CBS's Wyatt Andrews, on that same broadcast, described "an increasingly anxious middle class, whose dreams of upward mobility have met a downward reality." NBC's Mike Jensen, on the January 4 Nightly News, declared that "as for the future, American companies are locked on a new course. Layoffs and firings are no longer something they do only in a recession. Instead, they're business as usual."
<p>
AT&T's announcement that it would lay off 40,000 workers prompted many of the gloomy jobs stories. According to CNN's Kathleen Kennedy, on the January 3 World News, "The latest rounds of corporate cutbacks have left many people fearing that they may be the next to be fired. AT&T announced that it was cutting 40,000 jobs." On January 2 Brokaw announced that "if what happened today to 40,000 workers at AT&T is any kind of barometer of what's ahead, it will be another long, anxious year for the American middle class."
<p>
But neither followed up on the AT&T workers. Like almost all of the other reports about the country's job picture, they ignored the parts of the economy which are generating jobs. T.J. Rogers of Cypress Semiconductor, in the March 12 Wall Street Journal, argued that "for the past decade or more, jobs have been migrating to smaller, more nimble, entrepreneurial companies from the Fortune 500 as those companies streamline and lose employment. This trend strengthens our economy, but it has created a short-term fear for their jobs among Americans."
<p>
According to Rogers: "What is not publicized is that my company has already hired some of those [laid-off] AT&T people. And our rival, Cirrus Logic, beat us to the punch in starting up a design center in South Carolina to take advantage of hiring those ex-AT&T engineers. The bad news from big companies gets front-page coverage, but the near-immediate absorption of their skilled workers is rarely discussed."
<p>
Similarly, economics columnist Robert Samuelson noted in the March 13 Washington Post that most laid-off workers find valuable employment elsewhere. "Among rehired workers," Samuelson wrote, "the Labor Department reports as follows: 27 percent got wages at least 20 percent higher than at their previous jobs; 26 percent got wages up to 20 percent higher; 16 percent suffered a pay loss no greater than 20 percent; and 31 percent suffered pay losses of more than 20 percent.
<p>
And American Enterprise Institute economist Herbert Stein pointed out in the March 14 Wall Street Journal that "in 1995, on average, 5.6 percent of the civilian labor force was unemployed. In the previous 20 years the rate had been lower than that in only three years." According to Stein, "The highly publicized layoffs by large corporations were a tiny fraction of the labor force and a small fraction of the number of people who enter or leave employment each year."
<p>
Stein also wrote that "concern with insecurity ought to be evident in real behavior." He noted that people didn't change their smoking or drinking behavior until they became seriously concerned with health or their social behavior until they became seriously concerned about crime. "If people were seriously concerned about their economic condition one might expect them to save more, but they don't." He noted that people are not retiring later, a trend that would be expected if workers felt financially insecure.
<p>
But good business news is rarely news. Only two network news reports focused on the country's enormous job growth. One was by Wyatt Andrews for the February 6 CBS Evening News. Andrews reported that some companies which laid off workers over the past few years have started rehiring. "The era of layoffs in America is not over," Andrews told viewers, "but there is a countertrend going on. In the latest polls, most American managers now admit they fired too many people...and that growth, including the hiring of new workers, is the only way to survive."
<p>
The other was by NBC's Linda Vester on the January 26 Nightly News. "From small machine shops to giant auto plants," Vester reported, "the manufacturing industry is in dire need of the best and the brightest." She said that many manufacturers cannot find enough skilled workers and are even employing headhunters to recruit them. Vester told viewers that "according to one study more than half of America's manufacturers say they're having trouble finding qualified people." She pointed out that people seeking to meet the demand are enrolling at vocational schools. Vester was the only reporter to interview an economist about the country's job picture.
<p>
But Vester was an exception. For most of her colleagues, two things still stand in the way of presenting their viewers with an accurate picture of the economy: The overwhelming preference they have for interviewing politicians instead of economists and their obsession with bad -- and only bad -- business news.

<center><h2>Kudos: Tim Russert</h2>
</center>
<p>
It's not very often that a network journalist talks about the positive effects of business competition and stock market growth for workers and for Main Street America. Usually, only the victims of business competition are presented to viewers and those who gain from the stock market are portrayed as greedy. The unorthodox presidential candidacy of  Republican Pat Buchanan has caused some reporters to challenge such conventional wisdom.
<p>
Case-in-point: NBC's Tim Russert on the March 3 Meet the Press. Russert challenged Buchanan's protectionist trade views by asking the candidate: "Hasn't the [foreign] competition, in fact been good for GM and Ford? Taurus is now the number one car. American cars are better because the American people opted to buy Japanese cars because the quality was better and forced American automobile manufacturers to make their cars better."
<p>
Then Russert pointed out how important the stock market is to workers. "I've talked to a lot of people in large corporations and on Wall Street over the last week," he said, "and they tell me that if your trade policies were put in place and your economic program was put in place, it would be a shock to the stock market, that the market would collapse perhaps as much as 20 percent. And they reminded me of something I'm not even sure you're aware of. Do you know what percent of the stock market is pension money? It's a third. Fifty four million people have fully-funded pensions in this country... And Mr. Buchanan, if that market was rattled by your economic policies, pensioners could lose a half billion dollars and their security is threatened."
<p>
When most reporters challenge candidates' economic policies, they do so from the left. Kudos to Russert for challenging Buchanan from the right.

<title>Guest Editorial, by Bruce Bartlett</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Flat-Tax Flip-Floppers</h2>
</center>
<p>
One of the most remarkable things about the recent rise in popularity of the flat tax is the way leading newspapers and magazines that previously supported the idea have suddenly turned against it. In particular, the New York Times and Washington Post had previously editorialized in favor of the flat tax, but now both oppose the idea.
<p>
For example, in an April 15, 1982 editorial, the Post said, "The ideal income tax would be a flat percentage of all income above an arbitrary threshold of, say, $10,000 per year." It concluded that the flat tax "is the obvious remedy" to the problems of the tax system.
<p>
On June 3, 1982 the Post reiterated its support. "Replacing the [tax] system with a low-rate tax on income -- with few, if any, exclusions allowed -- is an idea that, by promising efficiency, equity and simplicity, appeals to all parts of the political spectrum," it said.
<p>
Fourteen years later, however, the Post is now opposed to what it had earlier supported. On January 19, the Post called the flat tax "a flawed idea, less a serious tax proposal than a slogan in the name of which the advocates claim to be able to accomplish several things at once." It concluded that the flat tax "wouldn't be an improvement." 
<p>
Back in 1982 the New York Times supported the flat tax. In a June 6, 1982 editorial, the Times favored "a flat-rate tax levied on a greatly broadened income base." It even praised Senator Jesse Helms's proposed 12 percent flat-rate tax.
<p>
As recently as 1992 the Times reiterated its support for the flat tax. In a March 27, 1992 editorial the Times explicitly endorsed the Hall-Rabushka plan upon which the Armey and Forbes plans are based. It called the flat tax "a superb idea."
<p>
But like the Post, the Times now opposes a flat tax. In a January 18, 1996 editorial the Times found "a glaring fault" in the flat tax. Like Claude Rains in Casablanca, the Times is now shocked, shocked to discover that the flat tax will benefit the wealthy! It concluded by denouncing the Forbes plan.
<p>
<%-2>Individual reporters have also flip-flopped on the flat tax. For example, <BI>Business Week<D>'s <B>Chris Farrell<D> thought the flat tax was great in a January 9, 1995 column. "If Washington legislators truly want to make a difference, they should...embrace a flat tax," he wrote. The Armey plan "makes sense  -- far more than any other reform being considered. Limiting exemptions and deductions would lower the tax rate by broadening the tax base. And the change would encourage a more efficient allocation of resources."<BI%0>
<p>
But like the Post and the Times, Farrell has suddenly decided that the flat tax is too risky. In a February 19, 1996 column, Farrell said flat-tax advocates are wrong. "Their florid rhetoric vastly overstates the economic gains and deeply understates the risks," he wrote. "The gains could be easily dwarfed by wrenching business and household upheavals as America shifts to a new tax code. Indeed, the transition to a flat tax is fraught with danger -- so much so that the long- term payoff may never come." According to Farrell, the stock market, home prices, and consumer spending all would collapse under a flat tax.
<p>
Such predictions can only be described as total nonsense. As Professor Glenn Hubbard of Columbia University points out, the magnitude of tax changes under a flat tax would be no greater than what we experienced in 1981 and 1986. And the impact on financial markets would be no greater than those experienced many times in the postwar era, when interest rates either rose or fell sharply. Moreover, there is no question that a flat tax will cause the stock market to rise, not fall.
<p>
Unfortunately, the ranks of those who have switched gears on the flat tax include conservatives. As a columnist, Pat Buchanan strongly supported Armey's flat-tax proposal. However, as a presidential candidate, Buchanan opposes it. In a January 27, 1996 article in the New York Times, Buchanan called the flat tax "simplistic" and attacked it for cutting the taxes of the rich. No wonder the Times published it.
<p>
<%-2>Of course, everyone has the right -- indeed, the obligation -- to reconsider their positions when con- fronted with new information. But when major newspapers and prominent writers switch their positions 180 degrees on a major issue, especially within a short period of time, readers are entitled to an explanation. Otherwise, they can only assume that prevailing fashion dictates editorial views, rather than facts and analysis, and that such views aren't worthy of serious consideration.<%0>

<TITLE>New Show Continues Prime Time Tradition of Business Bashing</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>

<h2><center>New Show Continues Prime Time Tradition of Business Bashing</h2>
<p>
<h3>Fox's Profit Motive</h3></center>
<p>
Profit, a new prime time show on Fox, starts from a unique premise. Far from being the sympathetic hero, Jim Profit, the main character whose voice narrates the show, is a villain. Viewers naturally root against, rather than for, the show's namesake. This is new, different, and daring, and it makes for entertaining television. But in another way, Profit is anything but new. As is so often the case on TV, the villain is a corporate executive. 
Jim Profit, in fact, is a supervillain gone berserk. In the show's premiere  episode, which aired April 8, Profit is shown to be a relentless climber at Gracen & Gracen (G&G), the company where he is a vice president. He uses confidential information to blackmail a decent secretary into sabotaging her equally decent boss, whose job Profit covets. When the secretary later comes to work for Profit, he says: "It's good to see Gail understands the basic nature of business. We adapt or pay the price."
<p>
He uses other ruthless means to weed out those in his way. He frames a female vice president for the blackmail of the secretary, getting her fired. He seduces the wife of another vice president, and then masterminds a plan to make it look like she's sleeping with G&G's CEO. When her husband beats up the CEO (who, by the way, does pick a new mistress every year), he gets fired. And viewers find out that Profit became a vice president in the first place by inducing a heart attack in the vice president above him.
How did profit become so evil? Late in the premiere, viewers learn that as a child Profit was forced by his father to live in a cardboard box and spent all his time watching television through a hole cut out of the box. Profit tracks down his father, kills him, and threatens to frame his stepmother if she turns him in or tries to thwart his business plans.
<p>
The appearance of the show has rekindled a long-running debate about Hollywood's portrayal of business. The experts' conventional wisdom: the greedy scoundrels are getting what they deserve. Graef Crystal, a psychologist and compensation expert, told USA Today that employees "can't take out [their] rage on the CEO -- that person is too powerful. You probably can't even talk to the press for fear of losing your job. But a show that makes you say 'yes, that's exactly what it's like' will hold your attention." 
<p>
Alan Merten, dean of Cornell University's Johnson Graduate School of Management, also pinned the blame on the business world. He told USA Today that corporate executives "should look at this trend and realize that whatever their financial motives, their actions aren't playing well in Peoria. The timing of some large layoffs and big [executive] bonus packages has been terrible."
<p>
Perhaps. But Hollywood's business bashing isn't, as Merten suggests, a new trend; it's an institution. The show Dallas was popular long before the current wave of layoffs and in a 1992 Media Research Center study of entertainment programming, businessmen were 43 percent of the criminals, far more than lawyers, politicians, or any other profession. Even, in the past, when there have been positive business characters, such as the business owners on Designing Women, they haven't been positive because of their business. By contrast, there were evil lawyers on L.A. Law, but also lawyers who benefited society because of the work they did.
<p>
A more likely explanation for Hollywood's continued business bashing is that entertainment television writers still hold to an ideology which cannot conceive of business as an honorable calling that serves society by producing goods, services, wealth, and jobs. Profit, to them, seems to be a four-letter word.

<Title>Kudos: Time's Branegan and CBS's Brady</Title>
</Head>
<Body BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<center><h2>Kudos: Time's Branegan and CBS's Brady</h2></center>
<p>
With job insecurity garnering headlines in the U.S. and many demanding that the government "do something" about it, few reporters have looked overseas to see what happens when governments try. Time's Jay Branegan did. According to Branegan, in the April 15 issue, "The rich benefits that have made Europe a sweet place to work have clogged its economic arteries. Call it Eurosclerosis -- the combination of a staggering tax burden and a blanket of regulations that smother new businesses and entrepreneurship."
<p>
Branegan's evidence: "Europe's unemployment rate of 11 percent is twice as high as the U.S.'s, and its job creation chart is a flat line. Over the past three years, the U.S. has created 8.4 million new jobs, Europe none. Significantly, many of those new American jobs pay higher than average wages, and as many as 60 percent are managerial or professional." Branegan also pointed out that high minimum-wage laws in such countries as France mean "many [Frenchmen] aren't working at all. Joblessness among young people, hit hardest by minimum-wage laws, is roughly twice France's overall unemployment rate of nearly 12 percent." Something for reporters to keep in mind as American politicians debate raising the U.S. minimum wage.
<p>
On the March 26 CBS Evening News, correspondent Ray Brady reported on one form of government spending that has largely escaped the budget ax -- corporate welfare. Specifically, Brady looked at federal subsidies for ethanol. According to Brady, "Critics, even those within the U.S. government, say the virtues of ethanol are way overstated. At a time when the government is cutting on social programs, they question why it's still handing out subsidies to the ethanol industry, subsidies that amount to nearly $800 million a year."
<p>
Brady recounted how "ethanol was born of desperation during the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s, when gasoline prices soared and lines pressed for miles. But now gasoline is plentiful, much cheaper to produce than ethanol. And today, ethanol accounts for just over one percent of all U.S. energy consumption." And while "ethanol does reduce some pollutants, the Congressional Budget Office says it contributes to others, such as ozone pollution."
<p>
Why, then, does the subsidy continue? "Many point to the lobbying of corn growers and generous political donations to both parties by Archer Daniels Midland, the world's largest producer of ethanol, and a major beneficiary of the government's subsidies." According to Brady, the ethanol industry has "racked up $6 billion in subsidies, courtesy of the American taxpayer."
<p>
Kudos to Branegan and Brady for practicing journalism at its best, with Branegan looking at the results of programs politicians are proposing and with Brady questioning programs neither political party wants questioned.

<p>
<h3>Privatized Paupers? No</h3>
</center>
<p>
On March 11 and 12, the CBS Evening News broadcast a two-part "Eye on America" segment by Ray Brady focusing on Social Security privatization. What started out as a compelling case for reform of the soon-to-be bankrupt pension program ended up as a broadside attack against the most promising reform -- privatization.
<p>
First, the background. Social Security now has an unfunded long-term liability of more than $5 trillion -- which exceeds the entire national debt. In 35 years, the system will be financially insolvent. Kaput. As CBS rightly pointed out, in 1950 there were 17 workers for every retired person. Today there are three; by 2030 there will be just two. To keep the system solvent at current benefit levels would require the tax rate to rise from 15 percent to as much as 30 percent. If there were ever a program that needed major reform, it is this one.
<p>
CBS discussed one potential way out of the box: to privatize the system and allow individual workers to place their payroll tax dollars into a personalized account, like an expanded IRA. Under rules established by the government, workers could invest this money in mutual funds and other investments. Brady interviewed Jose Pinera, the former economic minister of Chile, where privatization was adopted some 15 years ago. The results there have been remarkably successful. Chilean workers are now receiving a 13 percent annual rate of return on their Social Security investments.
<p>
Brady then cited a Cato Institute study documenting that in the United States, if a low-income worker were permitted to place his payroll taxes into an IRA, and that worker earned just the average rate of return on stocks and bonds since 1946, that worker would receive a benefit of $1,650 more per month from the IRA than under Social Security. As one of the editors of that study, I can attest that the results were reviewed by well-respected actuaries who found no fault with the methodology.
<p>
Brady, however, launched an attack against privatization by arguing that the Cato study made "dangerously optimistic assumptions." The "dangerously optimistic assumption" was that over the next 50 years investors will yield roughly the same average real rate of return in stocks and bonds as was recorded by financial markets over the past 50 years. No one knows for sure whether the markets will perform better or worse. Still, it is worth noting that over the past several years the stock market has substantially outperformed the average rate of return since 1945.
<p>
Then CBS rolled out objections to the plan, such as claims that the plan only works if "workers work their whole lifetime in a boom stock market." This is patently false. If we had a boom market for the next 50 years, and we privatized Social Security, most American workers would be millionaire pensioners when they retired. But even if workers placed all of their payroll tax into low-risk, low-return bonds, privatization is still a very good deal for workers of all incomes, vis-a-vis a non-privatized system.
<p>
The CBS report saved its heavy artillery for last. Brady said that instead of "making educated guesses about the future, like the proponents of privatization, we took a look at how a Social Security stock plan would have performed using real data from the past." (Note the false inference here, that the Cato Institute study did not "use real data from the past.") "Using an independent firm," CBS reported that a wealthy worker would get $30,000 more under privatization, but a low-income worker would get $13,000 less. Conclusion: privatization is unfair.
<p>
Just how were those numbers derived? Alas, we will never know. After repeated requests for the methodology, CBS has refused to reveal what firm produced them, what actuarial assumptions were used, and any other information about the results. While CBS was quick to attack privatization advocates for using "dangerous assumptions," that charge can't be made against CBS; the company won't tell us what their assumptions were. For all we know, the numbers were simply made up out of thin air.
<p>
Finally, CBS concluded that most Americans oppose Social Security privatization. How should the system be fixed, then? "Cut benefits and raise Social Security taxes." Two problems here. First, virtually every poll over the past ten years shows that raising the payroll tax is by far the least popular "fix" to the Social Security system. Second, raising the tax level and reducing the promised benefit make Social Security an even worse deal than it already is for young workers. Now they would have to pay more in for a lower benefit. What a deal! If we "reformed" Social Security in the way CBS suggests, privatization would be manifoldly more attractive to workers. Was this taken into account when CBS said low-income workers would be worse off under privatization?
<p>
Social Security reform is perhaps the single most important issue to young workers in America. What is needed is a careful, balanced, and reasoned presentation of the options. Too bad Ray Brady and CBS failed to provide it.

<Title>Issue Analysis: Income Stories Ignore Total Compensation</Title>
</Head>
<Body BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<center><h2>Issue Analysis: Income Stories Ignore Total Compensation</h2>
<p>
<h3>Network Reporting a Slave to Wages</h3>
</center>
<p>
Last month, MediaNomics reported that there were 19 stories about layoffs during the first two months of 1996, but only two stories about job growth. We noted how such a focus on the negative offered a distorted picture of the true nature of a competitive economy, which does destroy some jobs, but always creates more jobs.
<p>
The sister issue to job creation is living standards. A competitive economy would be of little benefit to workers if it caused their standard of living to decrease. Media Research Center analysts reviewed every story that focused on wages and incomes on network morning and evening shows during the first three months of 1996. Ten of the 11 stories stressed the alleged wage stagnation of average workers over the last few decades. Only one story pointed out that opportunities have been increasing. No story pointed out that when benefits and payroll taxes are included, workers' total compensation has been steadily increasing.
<p>
A lack of diversity in guest selection kept the morning shows from giving viewers a balanced story. For instance, on the March 12 Today, Bryant Gumbel interviewed only Jared Bernstein of the liberal Economic Policy Institute. Introducing the segment, Gumbel pointed out that the U.S. economy has created eight million new jobs over the last three years, adding that "the quantity of jobs is not being questioned, but the quality is."
<p>
Bernstein then said that "wages and compensation have been falling in our labor market since 1979 for most workers. yet in the current economy, profit rates, or corporate profits, are at a 30-year high." Bernstein also claimed that "this is a long-term trend and workers are experiencing falling wages and compensation and even increased turnover. That is, we have less stable employment and the typical American family is really running faster just to stay in place."
<p>
Gumbel's reaction: "OK, so let us accept all of that as fact. Could it be otherwise?" Since Gumbel didn't provide an alternative opinion, viewers had no choice but to accept Bernstein's assertions as fact.
<p>
Other reporters also seemed to assume that accounts of workers' falling wages was a fact. On the February 26 CBS Evening News, Dan Rather concluded that "the fear and anger of some American workers over layoffs and barely rising wages have emerged as a campaign issue." Earlier, on the February 22 CBS Evening News, Rather said: "Millions of American workers know it. Despite soaring profits and a record Wall Street, U.S. businesses are still cutting good jobs and barely raising wages."
<p>
On that same broadcast, correspondent Wyatt Andrews portrayed "an increasingly anxious middle class, whose dreams of upward mobility have met a downward reality." According to NBC's Mike Jensen, on the March 4 Nightly News, "William Young of California is typical -- 50, a victim of downsizing, laid off by Northrup after 29 years in the aerospace industry."
<p>
On the February 25 World News Sunday, ABC's Jeff Greenfield, normally one of the most balanced reporters at the networks, also bought the party line. He reported "something very disturbing behind the record Wall Street numbers and corporate profits." He interviewed a Wall Street economist who said, "This surge in financial markets was really based on an untenable situation of workers taking a real squeeze in living standards to improve corporate profit margins and competitive prowess." Greenfield called this the "dark side of productivity."
<p>
But just how dark is the American wage and income picture? According to Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas economists W. Michael Cox and Beverly J. Fox, writing in a January National Center for Policy Analysis Policy Backgrounder, it's not as bad as many have been led to believe. The problem with most analyses of stagnating wages is they don't look at benefits. Cox and Fox pointed out that "employee benefits have grown from 20 percent of payroll in 1953 to more than 41 percent today." Since benefits aren't taxed, they argue, employees have sought benefit increases. Increasing payroll taxes have also taken a bite out of wages.
<p>
Cox and Fox also maintain that looking at stagnating household income, as Bernstein apparently was, is misleading. "Today's households are nearly 15 percent smaller than they were in the 1970s -- so household income is spread over fewer people," they report. "The median family income statistics for yesterday's Brady Bunch cannot be accurately compared with those of today's Murphy Brown." Overall, Cox and Fox demonstrate that "per capita real personal income increased an average of 1.4 percent a year" from 1974 through 1993. Unfortunately neither they nor like-minded economists were interviewed by network reporters.
<p>
Only NBC's Jim Avila, on the March 4 Nightly News, gave any hint that the job and wage picture for American workers was not completely bleak. Though he didn't point out that total compensation has been increasing for American workers over the last few decades, he did look at small businesses creating jobs and noted that "many of the new jobs being created provide good salaries, full benefits, and something some of the old jobs did not provide -- a piece of the action. Often small companies offer new employees stock options and other incentives." According to Avila, "The workplace has changed, perhaps forever. The job security of the past replaced by uncertainty and, more often than you might think, also replaced by new opportunity." But, of course, Avila was the exception.

<title>Reporters Ignore Past Prices, Government Burden</title>

<center><h2>Reporters Ignore Past Prices, Government Burden</center></h2>
<p>
<center><h3>Networks Pump Up Gas-Price Story</center></h3>
<p>
Given how closely tuned the media antennae are to the political world, it's no surprise that the recent bump in gasoline prices was big news. Politicians in both parties tried to make political hay out of the price increase. Few reporters questioned their rhetoric by pointing out that gas prices, by historical standards, are not high and that they would be even lower if it weren't for taxes and regulations.
<p>
CBS saw a capitalist conspiracy behind the price hike. Dan Rather sounded the alarm on the April 30 CBS Evening News: "It's the question every American driver is asking with every trip to the pump. Why is the price of gasoline going up and up and up? Is it the free market at work, the law of supply and demand? Or, is it greed, or possibly even something more sinister?"
<p>
CBS economics correspondent Ray Brady suspected the latter. After an industry soundbite defending the price hikes, Brady reported that "critics say those high pump prices come from gouging, [that] the industry deliberately let supplies drop." Brady also blamed Americans for "driving longer distances to work in popular gas guzzlers. And speeding; no more 55-mile-an-hour federal speed limit."
<p>
Curiously, in the very next story, CBS didn't hint at conspiracy when Clinton moved to keep beef prices high. According to Rather, "President Clinton is giving some election-year help to America's ranchers and farmers. The President took action today to try to boost cattle prices, which have fallen to their lowest level in ten years."
<p>
The other networks were a little more calm about the gasoline price hike. ABC's Brian Rooney, on the April 24 World News Tonight, blamed "a combination of unrelated events" for the higher gasoline prices. Rooney pointed out that "crude oil traders were predicting that the United Nations would partially lift the ban on Iraqi oil, which would have put more and cheaper oil on the market. When that didn't happen, the rush to buy from other sources drove the price up." Rooney also informed viewers that the long Northeastern winter contributed to the higher prices.
<p>
Over at NBC, Tom Brokaw said, on the April 30 Nightly News: "We don't have to tell you tonight that gas prices are still stuck at very high levels." Of the government investigation, correspondent Pete Williams said: "Some government economists are skeptical the investigation will turn up anything illegal." He also pinned blame on the weather: "They say prices are up because the severe storm from last winter drove up demand for heating oil, leaving less crude oil for making gasoline."
<p>
Rooney and Williams were correct, as far as they went. But were gas price really "at very high levels"? John Merline, in the May 7 Investor's Business Daily, looked at history for an answer. "After controlling for inflation," he reported, "a gallon of gas today costs 27 percent less than it did in 1949, and 23 percent less than a gallon did as recently as 1985." He pointed out that "even at the high pump prices posted at the end of April, the average national gasoline price is about the same as it was in June of last year."
<p>
Merline spotted the real story, that "today's prices would be lower still were it not for the substantial added cost imposed by government." Neither Brady, Rooney, or Williams mentioned, as Merline did, that "today, the combined federal-state tax is 37 cents a gallon. The federal tax stands at 18 cents a gallon, and the median state tax is 19 cents." 
<p>
"At today's prices," he added, "taxes alone account for more than a quarter of the pump price." Merline also explained that government regulations raise the price of gasoline at least four cents a gallon.
<p>
While Rooney and Williams at least didn't get the story wrong, they still didn't get the full story. Many network news viewers still may not know how much government adds to the price of gasoline.

<p>
What would someone with one foot in the civil rights community and one in the business world think about proposals to raise the minimum wage? Reporter Michael Winsop, in the May 10 New York Times, sought to answer that question. He interviewed Robert Bobbitt, Sr., past president of the board of the Canton, Ohio Urban League and now an owner of four McDonald's franchises in Canton's suburbs.
<p>
Winsop explained that "being the boss changed Mr. Bobbitt's politics. Nearly a decade ago he began voting Republican. The Democrat's current push in Washington to raise the minimum wage to $5.15 an hour from $4.25 illustrates why." According to Bobbitt, "Before, I would have thought of the minimum wage as a social issue. Then you start working for yourself, and all the risk and responsibilities are on you."
<p>
Winsop told how Bobbitt and another businessman went to see their Congressman. "They explained that 60 percent to 70 percent of their employees were suburban teenagers, many living at home and working to pay for a car and insurance."
<p>
In the May 5 Washington Post, staff writer Steven Pearlstein poked holes in the conventional wisdom about falling wages. Pointing to studies showing falling wages, he wrote that "by measuring only cash wages, the median wage series ignores the fact that employees have been receiving a greater share of their compensation in the form of tax-free fringe benefits." According to Pearlstein, "Most economists now agree that the government's main inflation gauge, the consumer price index, overstates the rise in the cost of living. And because income data are adjusted by the CPI, the effect of overstating inflation is to understate income."
<p>
Kudos to Winsop and Pearlstein for showing underreported sides of economic stories.

<center><h2>Guest Editorial, by Lawrence Hunter</h2></center>
<center><h3>Easy Money for Trial Lawyers</h3></center>

Time Warner's Money magazine claims to be a publication for serious investors. 
But lately Money seems to be fronting for an unholy alliance of anti-business 
activist Ralph Nader and a small group of the nation's most predatory trial 
lawyers. While dozens of liberal Democrats joined Republicans last December in 
passing securities litigation reform legislation in the only override of a 
Clinton veto, Money aligned itself with Nader's camp against the popular reform 
bill.
<p>
For years, "strike suit" securities lawyers have reaped lavish incomes 
targeting advanced technology and other growth companies. When stock prices 
drop suddenly, the lawyers typically swoop down and extract multimillion-dollar 
settlements. The system has made it so costly for companies to defend 
themselves against baseless charges that many are forced to settle out of 
court.
<p>
Over the past four years, settlements in such suits have cost investors more 
than $2.5 billion, one third of which -- $825 million -- went straight into the 
pockets of the "strike suit" lawyers.
<p>
The securities bar helped finance Ralph Nader's high-profile campaign against 
the federal legislation to curb abusive securities suits. Then President 
Clinton -- whose career has been largely financed by trial lawyers' largesse -- 
vetoed the legislation.
<p>
Scores of liberal Democrats, including Sen. Edward Kennedy, Democratic National 
Committee Chairman Sen. Chris Dodd, and California Rep. Vic Fazio, joined 
Republicans to override the veto. They found support in much of the media, 
including a Washington Post editorial charging Clinton had "caved to the trial 
lawyers' lobby."
<p>
But Nader, President Clinton, and the trial lawyers had a reliable ally in 
Money magazine. Money's coverage was brazenly one-sided. In four of the five 
monthly editions preceding passage of the bill, managing editor Frank Lalli 
used his column to inveigh against the legislation. Money's fixation is all the 
more notable because Lalli's column is the only opinion piece each month. The 
magazine even ginned up a letter-writing campaign in support of a veto.
During the year of congressional debate on the bill, Money published no 
information about the benefits of the legislation, just Lalli's opinions.
<p>
Month after month, Money's opinion campaign broke the rules of honest advocacy. 
Persistently, the magazine published false or misleading characterizations of 
the reform bill. For instance:
Money falsely charged that the bill would "allow executives to deliberately 
lie." In fact, the bill specifically outlaws executives from making knowingly 
fraudulent statements. The bill does create a limited "safe harbor" for 
good-faith disclosure of forward-looking financial information. A Washington 
Post editorial praised the "safe harbor" for shielding companies "from a style 
of legal assault that is not far from extortion."
<p>
Money wrongly complained that "investors who sue and lose could be forced to 
pay the winner's court costs." The bill does not impose a "loser pays" or "fee 
shifting" provision. Instead it takes a modest step to toughen existing federal 
rules against frivolous claims, whether they are made by the plaintiff or 
defendant.
<p>
Money put things completely backwards in saying "accountants who okay 
fraudulent books will get protection." In fact, the bill gives the Securities 
and Exchange Commission new power to act against accountants, lawyers, and 
others who assist securities fraud.
<p>
The magazine refused to publish letters to the editor in support of the reform 
bill. It is unclear why a publication that professes to be a serious investors' 
magazine allowed only one side's arguments to be heard on an important issue 
for investors. Whatever the motive may be, surely it is not a serious search 
for the truth.
<p>
Securities litigation reform remains a hot political item. Securities lawyers 
are spending millions of dollars on a California ballot initiative that would 
effectively negate the new federal reform law's effect in that state and across 
the nation. Ralph Nader is campaigning ardently for the trial lawyers' 
initiative.
<p>
Those who keep Money magazine in business should take serious stock of its 
editorial policies and practices. Time Warner shareholders and executives -- 
and Money's readers and advertisers -- are in the best position to decide what 
editorial opinions on public policies best reflect their values. But clearly 
everyone is done a disservice when a publication attempts to justify its 
editorial opinion through falsehood and distortion.

the Congressional Joint Economic Committee.

<title>Issue Analysis: Reporters Miss Important Angles of Debate</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">

<center><h2>Issue Analysis: Reporters Miss Important Angles of 
Debate</h2></center>
<center><h3>Minimum Depth on Minimum Wage</h3></center>

One of the key debates currently defining the differences between Republicans 
and Democrats is the argument over efforts to raise the minimum wage. Democrats 
argue that the government can legislate higher pay for those earning the 
minimum wage without harming anyone. Republicans, on the other hand, argue that 
by artificially raising wages, the government will cause employers to lay off 
workers.
<p>
On which side did the media weigh in? Media Research Center analysts reviewed 
all of the minimum wage stories on evening news shows (ABC, CBS, CNN, NBC) and 
morning news shows (ABC, CBS, NBC). There were 36 stories and anchor reads 
about the debate. With a few exceptions, the networks took the side of those 
supporting a minimum-wage increase. For example:
Soundbite sources were almost twice as likely to be supporters of the 
minimum-wage increase than opponents. Out of 60 soundbite sources, 39 supported 
the minimum-wage increase, while only 21 were opposed to it. Several stories 
contained soundbites only from Democrats and their allies.
<p>
Bob Schieffer's April 25 CBS Evening News report, for instance, had soundbites 
from Democrats Maxine Waters, Ted Kennedy, Al Gore, and two minimum wage 
workers whom the Democrats had brought to Washington for a news conference. 
"Democrats will keep the pressure up," Schieffer said. "They believe that 
Republicans are taking such a pounding on this they'll eventually allow a 
vote." He didn't tell viewers what Republicans believed.
<p>
This emphasis on supporters of the minimum-wage hike led some reporters to 
accept the Democrats' opinion that the wage could be increased without harming 
workers. According to NBC's Lisa Myers, on the April 17 Nightly News, a 
minimum-wage increase would be "good news for about 10 million workers now 
earning near the minimum wage of $4.25 an hour, frozen since 1989." CNN's 
Kathleen Kennedy, on the April 24 The World Tonight, worried that "people 
earning the minimum wage may not get a raise anytime soon. Despite political 
pressure from both parties, House Republican leaders Newt Gingrich and Dick 
Armey have virtually ruled out scheduling a vote on the minimum-wage increase."
The political horse-race aspect of the debate was emphasized far more than the 
economics of the debate. There were only three soundbites from economists; 
there were 46 soundbites from politicians. The networks were much more 
interested in who would win and lose politically from the debate than what the 
effect would be on the country. According to NBC's Tom Brokaw, on the April 17 
Nightly News, it was likely that "the most basic wage in this country affecting 
millions of workers and businesses will go up. But, who gets the credit?"
<p>
This weighed heavily on the minds of other reporters, as well. NBC's Jim 
Miklaszewski, on the April 24 Nightly News, predicted that "by digging in their 
heels, Republicans may also be digging themselves into a political hole." And 
ABC's Cokie Roberts, on the April 23 Good Morning America, said: "If the 
Republicans are stuck going along, then they want to get some credit."
Journalists were more interested in interviewing other journalists than in 
interviewing economists. The obsession with political angles reached almost 
comic proportions at times. On the morning shows, where live interviews are 
common, there were five such interviews of journalists about the minimum wage, 
but none with economists.
<p>
ABC's Willow Bay interviewed ABC's Sam Donaldson on a Good Morning America 
Sunday segment. ABC's Charles Gibson interviewed ABC's Cokie Roberts and ABC's 
Tyler Mathison on a Good Morning America segment. NBC's Bryant Gumbel 
interviewed NBC's Tim Russert on a Today segment. And CBS's Harry Smith 
interviewed The Weekly Standard's Fred Barnes. None of these shows were 
interested in the insights of economists, however.
<p>
There was more skepticism of Republican motives than Democratic motives. Three 
stories suggested that Republicans opposed raising the minimum wage because 
their business allies opposed it. ABC's Carole Simpson, on the April 28 World 
News Sunday, reported that Republicans "say [a minimum-wage hike] is bad for 
small business." According to Bob Schieffer, on the April 17 CBS Evening News, 
Republicans "know polls show most Americans favor an increase, but many of 
their business allies oppose it." Neither Simpson or Schieffer suggested that 
Republicans may oppose an increase because it would hurt workers.
<p>
No reporter made the analogous charge against Democrats, that they support the 
increase simply because their labor allies support it. NBC's Jim Miklaszewski, 
on the April 25 Today, did at least state that there was a principle at stake 
for the GOP: "They can stand their ground on principle on this issue, but lose 
ground in public opinion." He did not explain what that principle was, though.
The one study of the impact of minimum wage increases cited by reporters is one 
most economists disavow. The infamous Card-Krueger study, named after the two 
economists who directed it, was mentioned favorably in two stories. Card and 
Krueger looked at the impact of a minimum-wage increase in New Jersey, compared 
to neighboring Pennsylvania, which hadn't increased its state minimum wage. 
They found that there was no job loss in New Jersey due to the increase. Since 
this is one of the only studies to produce such a finding, it is often cited by 
advocates of increasing the minimum wage.
<p>
ABC's Tyler Mathison mentioned the study on the April 23 Good Morning America. 
NBC's Mike Jensen also mentioned it favorably on the April 26 Nightly News. 
Neither of them mentioned the well-publicized problems many economists found 
with the study's methodology. Jensen, in fact, used a soundbite from one of the 
study's chief critics, economist Richard Berman, but didn't mention his 
criticisms of the study. He even employed an Alan Krueger soundbite to refute 
Berman.
<p>
There were exceptions to the biased coverage. ABC's Bob Zelnick, on the April 
24 Good Morning America, pointed out that "if labor costs rise too much, many 
employers might simply fire workers or cut back on new hires." And while 
journalists usually don't bother to interview small-business owners about how 
political policies will affect them, several did interview them about the 
minimum wage. NBC's Tom Brokaw devoted an entire Nightly News segment to the 
concerns of a small business owner "in his own words."
<p>
By far the best interview segment about the minimum wage was Anthony Mason's 
interview of Republican Senator Don Nickles and Democratic Congressman David 
Bonior for the April 22 CBS This Morning. Mason challenged both politicians, 
and in so doing brought up points no other reporter mentioned. For instance, he 
asked Bonior: "After the last increase in the minimum wage, Department of Labor 
statistics show we lost some half a million jobs, I believe. Is this going to 
cost us jobs? Are we making a mistake if we do this now?"
<p>
He also asked Bonior, "Congressman, in the first two years of President 
Clinton's term, when you controlled Congress, this issue was never brought up. 
Why is it on the table suddenly now, when we're running up to an election? You 
had an opportunity to do something and it wasn't done then." Mason was the only 
reporter to look at what happened after past federal minimum-wage hikes and to 
point out that the Democrats didn't increase the minimum wage when they 
controlled Congress.
<p>
But for the most part, coverage of the minimum wage was overwhelmingly devoted 
to superficial political calculations, and even then, biased against those who 
opposed an increase in the minimum wage.

<title>Issue Analysis: Networks Don't Ask About Tuition Inflation</title>

<H2><center>Issue Analysis: Networks Don't Ask About Tuition Inflation</h2></center>
<p>
<center><h3>No Skepticism Toward College Costs</h3></center>
<p>
Imagine that there's a product or a service that has gone up in price by 239 percent over the past fifteen years and whose cost continues to increase well ahead of the rate of inflation. Imagine further that the company that produces the product or service blames consumers for the steep price increases. Would reporters accept such an excuse at face value? The CEO of the company would surely be seen sweating before the cameras of 60 Minutes or getting stern lectures from Nightline's Ted Koppel, right?
<p><b>
Not if the product is a college education.</B><br>
The same reporters who are quick to expect the worst -- and demand government action -- when businesses raise prices show a curious lack of curiosity about the shocking rise in college tuition rates over the past several years. In stories about tuition hikes, reporters almost never question the price increases. And they never, ever, bring up the explanation many conservatives and economists point to: government education subsidies help cause the price hikes.
<p>
The most recent example of this lack of skepticism came when President Clinton proposed a $1,500 tax credit for students in their first two years of college. On June 4, the day Clinton announced his proposal, no network report even hinted that it might cause tuition increases. CBS's Rita Braver, for example, merely said that it was "aimed at attracting all students into post-high school education." Peter Jennings called it "the latest giveaway in presidential politics." (That's what they always call tax cuts.) Jennings did point out in the next story that "college expenses are growing at twice the rate of inflation." But he didn't ask why or suggest that some argue Clinton's proposal would add to the problem.
<p>
This is part of a long pattern in network reporting on higher education. Media Research Center analysts reviewed all 23 stories about higher education financing on the ABC, CBS, CNN, and NBC news shows between June 1, 1995 and June 1, 1996. No reporter in any of the stories mentioned the argument that federal aid helps fuel the escalation in tuition costs.
<p>
To be sure, reporters often do point out that tuition costs are increasing dramatically. Many of the stories on higher education focus on families trying to deal with such costs. ABC's Tyler Mathison, on the July 12, 1995 <i>Good Morning America</i>, reported that with costs so high, "it's no wonder more and more American families are borrowing to pay the bills." Many stories are helpful to consumers by pointing out which colleges are the best buys.
<p>
But reporters rarely ask why college costs are rising. And when they do, they accept, without challenge, answers they would never accept from industry. Example: CBS's Susan Spencer, on the May 2, 1996 48 Hours. A college administrator told her that he would like to cut costs, but it might hurt the reputation of his school. "So most colleges aren't even trying to cut tuition," Spencer reported. "People might think the quality of education had been cut as well."
<p>
CBS had a different attitude toward the recent gasoline price increases. Dan Rather wondered: "Is it the free market at work, the law of supply and demand? Or, is it greed, or something more sinister?" The networks have also demanded explanations for price increases of other products, such as gasoline or breakfast cereals. But the ivory tower is above such questioning.
<p>
This omission leads to biased reporting of education policy proposals. CNN's Bobbie Battista, reporting on a speech by First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton for the June 1, 1995 Inside Politics, said: "Mrs. Clinton also tweaked those who benefited from the U.S. education system and now want to cut it...She didn't name names, but presidential candidate Phil Gramm, who wants to abolish the Department of Education, went to college thanks to government-sponsored loans." And in hundreds of stories over the past year, Bill Clinton repeated his claim that cutting federal aid to students was "extreme" without being asked why taxpayers must continue to finance higher education's largesse.
<p>
Only one network reporter even suggested the tuition price increases may not be justified. Former CBS This Morning co-host Harry Smith, on March 12, pointed out that "the private sector, in terms of business out there, has done all this cutting over the last ten years or so to become more competitive." He asked consumer reporter Hattie Kauffman: "Are colleges doing that at all?" But even Smith didn't point out the argument that colleges and universities are shielded from such efficiency because of government subsidies.
<p>
Had he read an article by John Hood of the John Locke Foundation, in the May, 1995 issue of Reason, he might have. "Is land for classrooms that much more expensive? Is there a shortage of people becoming professors, bidding up the wages of those currently in colleges and universities? Do books cost more than they used to?" Hood asks. "The short answer is maybe -- but the cost increase in higher education far outpaces increases in any of those expenditures."
<p>
According to Hood, there are so many government subsidies at even private colleges and universities that "tuition and fees have only the murkiest relationship to the costs of providing higher education. The 'costs' themselves are essentially arbitrary." Hood explains that federal aid is given to a student based on how much costs exceed the student's "expected family contribution." Since colleges and universities know the average expected family contribution, they can increase tuitions and make more students eligible for aid. "Families will pay more, but a good portion of the tuition hike will be picked up by the government. Hence, colleges and universities can get more money for providing exactly the same service."
<p>
Proof? Hood looks at history. "During the 1970s, the real-dollar value of government assistance to higher education, adjusted for the number of full-time students, fell slightly. So did real tuition, room, and board charges for both public and private colleges," he claims. "Throughout the 1980s, however, government assistance per full-time student rose significantly (10 percent, not including loans), accompanied by a 27 percent real rise in public college charges and a staggering 50 percent real rise in private college charges." He points out that revenue from Pell grants rose by more than 25 percent between 1985 and 1992 and that state level grants rose by 15 percent. All the while, college administrators were complaining about "cutbacks" in federal aid and using that as an excuse to raise tuition.
<p>
But network reporters don't challenge college administrators about their continuous price increases. Apparently, when it comes to higher education, greed is good, or at least not worthy of criticism.

<h2><center>Editor's Note, by Timothy Lamer</center></h2>
<p>
<center><h3>Press: Fiscal Conservatives?</center></h3>
<p>
"There is a liberal bias [in the media]; it's demonstrable." 
"The old argument that the networks and other `media elites' have a liberal bias is so blatantly true that it's hardly worth discussing anymore."
Are these quotes from Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey? Or maybe Rush Limbaugh and William Bennett? No, the above quotes are from two members of the "media elite" -- Newsweek Washington bureau chief Evan Thomas and CBS News correspondent Bernard Goldberg.
<p>
In the face of overwhelming evidence, some journalists are beginning to admit there's a liberal bias in the national media. But many of them ludicrously maintain that the bias only extends to social and cultural issues, not to economic issues, and that most reporters are in fact economic conservatives.
James Fallows of the Atlantic Monthly makes this claim in his recent book Breaking the News. He argues that "the supposed liberalism of the elite press is more limited than many people believe. On economic issues -- taxes, welfare, deficit control, trade policy, attitudes toward labor unions -- elite reporters' views have become far more conservative over the last generation, as their incomes have gone up."
<p>
The Washington Post's E.J. Dionne agrees. During a May 29 Brookings Institution panel discussion, he said that "the press mostly has the biases of the educated, some would say over-educated, upper middle class." This, Dionne argued, means there is a  liberal bias in coverage of social issues, but "the issues we're most conservative on are in fact economic issues, just like much of the upper middle class that looks at its tax bill."
<p>
Fallows and Dionne are highly- regarded beltway journalists, and properly so. But on this issue they are terribly mistaken. Their argument lacks one element: proof. Numerous studies conducted by the Media Research Center demonstrate that most economic reporting in the non-business media is solidly liberal. For example:
<p>
Tax cuts. Reporters used to be less biased in tax coverage than they have been recently. It was the Republican takeover of Congress in 1994 that ended any semblence of balance on tax issues. When tax cuts were being discussed in December of 1994, all 12 economists interviewed by the networks were against cutting taxes. The message: no matter what politicians say, tax cuts are bad economics. Then this year, when Steve Forbes' flat tax became a hot issue, reporters were more than twice as likely to mention arguments against it than for it. Fifty-one arguments against the flat tax were presented during January on the networks and in national news magazines. Only 24 arguments in favor were presented. Fallows and Dionne must know that "Reaganomics" has become a cuss word among reporters.
<p>
Federal regulations and mandates. Like most liberals, reporters seem to think businesses have money trees in their stockrooms. It rarely occurs to them that companies may have to increase prices, lay off workers, or reduce salaries and benefits in order to comply with regulations and mandates. A recent example is the debate over increasing the minimum wage. During the first four months of 1996, there were 60 sources interviewed for soundbites by the networks. Almost twice as many supported the increase (39) than opposed it (21).
<p>
Some reporters simply accepted the Democrats' logic at face value. According to NBC's Lisa Myers, the increase would be "good news for about 10 million workers" who earn near the minimum wage. CNN's Kathleen Kennedy worried that if the two parties couldn't agree, "people earning the minimum wage may not get a raise anytime soon."
<p>
Federal spending and the budget. Reporters seem to favor budget discipline when the issue is cutting taxes. But when spending programs are threatened, anecdotes abound outlining who will allegedly be harmed by fiscal restraint. During the first hundred days of this Congress, 34 network stories asserted that a balanced budget achieved by spending restraint would harm the poor. Only four stories focused on the benefits of a more limited government. And during the two government shutdowns last year, reporters repeatedly intoned about the "critical cuts" (Dan Rather) and "major cutbacks" (Tom Brokaw) in the GOP budget, without mentioning that Republicans planned to spend $267 billion more in 2002 than in 1996. According to CBS's Bob Mc-Namara, the shutdowns were "a hard lesson on what happens when big government goes away."
<p>
Part of the Fallows-Dionne misunderstanding may be in defining economic conservatism. For some reporters the definition is broad enough to include the architect of the Clinton health plan. CNN's Jeff Levine, on the August 30, 1993 Inside Politics, described (I'm not making this up) "the Ira Magaziner people" as "free marketeers."
<p>
If someone who proposed the biggest increase in government power since the New Deal is a "free marketeer," then who isn't? But if the definition includes, at the very least, some skepticism about government's ability to solve society's problems, few in the "media elite" qualify.

<title>After Hyping Worker Anxiety, National Press Ignores Contrary Evidence</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>After Hyping Worker Anxiety, National Press Ignores Contrary Evidence</center></h2>
<p>
<center><h3>Poll: Workers: Happy. Media: Yawn.</center></h3>
<p>
Few mantras have been repeated more often in the media this year than the one about anxious American workers. It's accepted as fact among reporters that American workers are alarmed about their prospects in the new, global economy.
Just ask Dan Rather. As MediaNomics reported earlier this year, he spotted "fear and anger" in the workforce over "layoffs and barely rising wages." According to CNN's Kathleen Kennedy, "The latest rounds of corporate cutbacks have left many people fearing that they may be the next to be fired." 
<p>
Tom Brokaw, introducing a January 29 Nightly News story about "today's frightening job market," announced: "Job security is a thing of the past now and the way of the future is downsizing and layoffs, even for America's biggest companies. It's making for serious anxiety." 
<p>
The print media have been similarlyfocused on gloom. The January 22 U.S. News & World Report cover asked: "Is the American Worker Getting Shafted?" (The magazine's answer: yes.) Newsweek's February 26 cover labeled four executives who had laid off employees as "Corporate Killers," and declared that the "public is scared as hell."
<p>
The New York Times saw fit to print a seven-part series depicting American workplaces as "battlefields" with "millions of casualties." According to the Times, the story of a man who lost a high-paying bank job, was forced to take a job at one-fourth the pay, and then had his family leave him "is no longer extraordinary."
<p><b>
Really?</b><br>
To find out, Inc. magazine tried something different. Rather than repeating emotional anecdotes about companies laying off loyal workers, Inc. commissioned the Gallup Organization to conduct a nationwide poll of workers.
<p>
"Across the board the 34 questions [to the worker survey] prompted upbeat -- sometimes even glowing -- responses," the magazine found. For example: 90 percent of the respondents were not worried about losing their jobs and 75 percent had not had three or more days in the past month when stress caused them to behave badly with their families. (For more survey results, see box.)
<p>
Interestingly, Inc. found that on many questions, workers at smaller companies are happier than those at large firms. The national media may be missing the story of worker happiness because they relentlessly focus on big business. Last summer, Media- Nomics found that in the first six months of 1995, there were 119 network evening news stories on the health of large companies, while only 13 stories focused on the health of those companies not in the Fortune 500.
This is truly a whopper of an omission, since smaller, fast-growing companies ("gazelles") created five million jobs between 1990 and 1994, while other companies lost 800,000.
<p>
The non-business media have not reported Inc.'s findings and have yet to tell the whole story about the true nature of the American workplace. It is a picture of the entire economy -- they aren't telling the whole story.

On May 2, the Clinton administration (and many reporters) busily played up the 
news that the economy had grown at a 2.8 percent rate. ABC's Brit Hume, while 
not downplaying the news, put it in political perspective.
<P>
Hume reported that Clinton economic advisor Laura D'Andrea Tyson called this 
"the second longest peacetime expansion since World War II, not mentioning that 
the longest was during the Reagan years, which the Clinton administration 
prefers to call the decade of greed." Hume pointed out that "she also did not 
mention that the expansion includes the last part of the Bush administration, a 
time Mr. Clinton always claimed was a recession."
<P>
Later that month, NBC's Mike Jensen reported another bit of good economic news. 
The giant companies that had been downsizing, Jensen said, have "finally 
started to rehire."
<P>
Unlike past reports on downsizing, Jensen interviewed a consultant who 
explained that the downsizing wave allowed companies to become more productive 
and profitable. The consultant, John Challenger, told viewers: "These companies 
are able to hire many people because of the downsizing decisions they made over 
the last few years."
<P>
Jensen even mentioned something rarely revealed in the news: "Ninety thousand 
new jobs were added to the nation's workforce every month on average for the 
last year, many of them at small companies." Jensen ended on a negative note, 
though. He said that many of these big companies are still downsizing their 
weaker divisions. "That's the new corporate America. Quick to fire, quick to 
hire, with American workers scrambling to find a job and to keep one." (See 
front page for why that's not the typical plight of workers.)

<title>The Algers: Back to the Future</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>The Algers: Back to the Future</h2></center>
<p>
<center><h3>CBS show highlights successful owners of growing businesses</h3></center>
<p>
On the evening of June 16, CBS aired a program whose message was mainstream American: that talent, initiative, perseverance, and, usually, religious faith are the formula for business success. For an hour viewers saw an unusual sight: Hollywood celebrities unabashedly touting the virtues of free market successes.
A rerun from the 1950s? Hardly. It was the 48th annual Horatio Alger Awards. From the opening segment, Ray Charles's rendition of "America the Beautiful," Bob Dole and William Bennett couldn't have scripted a more tradition-friendly, role model-dominated hour.
<p>
As always, Algers were presented to persons who, like the award's namesake, have emerged from humble circumstances to make a name for themselves. Each story is magnificent non-fiction that shatters the myth that America is no longer the land of opportunity. 
<p>
This path, as viewers saw, knows neither gender nor color: among this year's honorees were a woman -- Ruth Fertel, founder of the Ruth's Chris Steak House chain -- and two blacks: music entrepreneur Quincy Jones and Joe Dudley, who grew up in a three-room shack as one of eleven children and now runs the Dudley Products cosmetics company.
<p>
In videotaped biographical packages preceding their acceptance of the award, the winners discussed their success and their philosophies of life. By dint of hard work, Herbert Boeckmann wound up running the largest Ford dealership in America. This highly motivated achiever spoke movingly of how his father's charitable deeds had spurred his own efforts toward "help[ing] people help themselves."
<p> 
Qunicy Jones reflected: "I don't think God put us here to have everything go right every minute. That's why He's got those other funny words like 'discipline' and 'adversity.' That's what helps shape your character, and it sounds corny, but it's not corny, it's real."  
<p>
John Pappajohn, the president of Equity Dynamics, reminisced about growing up: "We didn't have much money, but we seemed to get along just fine." And he remarked, "I was recently asked by a young man who suffered adversity, 'What do I have to do in order to be successful?' I said, 'Have a dream, and be willing to pay the price in order to have your dream come true.'" 
<p>
Dennis Washington, who now presides over a business empire which includes construction, railroad, mining, and shipping companies, remembered, "We didn't have a lot of money...but the family was together. That means so much."
Looking back, Washington says, "The early part of your life, you may get [dealt] a bad hand, but, remember, that's a [short] period...and if you can focus on the future by finding something that you like to do, with luck and help from God, you're gonna have a good life." 
<p>
As traditional values-oriented as the Algers were, there was nothing politically partisan about them. (Even a brief appearance by Maya Angelou was non-PC.) The show was co-hosted by actress Markie Post and actor John Ritter, both of whom have been outspokenly pro-Clinton; nonetheless, they effectively articulated what the Algers represent. 
<p>
When Ritter, introducing one honoree -- Miami Dolphins coach Don Shula -- declared, "Values, beliefs, principles. You know, some call those old-fashioned, but to others, they're the surest sign of leadership," it was hard to imagine Charlton Heston doing it any better.
<p>
The Algers were produced for television by actor Don Johnson. Two years ago, on the occasion of the ceremony's first national telecast, Johnson told the Media Research Center that the awards are "based on good, old-fashioned, fundamental tools for success...Let's encourage success. That's what America's about." Again, like Post and Ritter, Johnson is not known as a conservative Republican. <p> 
The Algers will never be standard prime time fare, yet it's hard not to think that there's room for other programs like it. And perhaps some of prime time television's scriptwriters, who so often like to paint businessmen as society's villains, were watching and picking up ideas for inspirational business storylines.

<title>Minimum Scrutiny at the New York Times</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Minimum Scrutiny at the New York Times</h2></center>
<p>
In 1994 Princeton economists David Card and Alan Krueger released the "New Jersey Study," a research paper which claimed that a hike in the minimum wage would increase employment. The Card-Krueger study received considerable press attention, and very little scrutiny, even though it provided the intellectual argument for the Clinton administration's proposal to increase the minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.15 an hour in February of this year.   
<p>
The New York Times, for example, touted the study and its call for a hike in the minimum wage in several stories. The Times' Louis Uchitelle wrote in the January 12 Business section: "Two Princeton University economists, David Card and Alan Krueger, contend there is little evidence of any job loss at all from increasing the minimum wage." 
<p>
Since the initial reports of the Card-Krueger study, however, the Employment Policies Institute (EPI) has found that the study is based on flawed data. In a March 29 Wall Street Journal column, EPI Executive Director Richard Berman contends that "the Card-Krueger data are worse than flawed -- they are grossly inaccurate." Berman continues: "How do I know? My organization took the time to check the actual payroll records [studied by Card and Krueger]...The payroll records do not match the Card-Krueger data. Only a handful come anywhere close."
<p>
Several newspapers across the country, including the Washington Post and the Los Angeles Times, have published EPI's findings. But despite several attempts by EPI to point out the flaws of the Card-Krueger study to the Times, America's newspaper of record has not yet acknowledged the Institute's findings.
<p>
John Doyle of EPI tells MediaNomics that "it was a real surprise when -- after the study was proven to be based on flawed data, and as a result, worthless -- the New York Times ignored our repeated efforts to publicize the study's flaws. This was not a critique of just another economic study. We pulled the underpinning from the administration's efforts to hike the minimum wage."
Perhaps the Times is just waiting for the right news peg.

<title>Reporters Still Ignoring the Real Tax Record of the 1980s</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Tax and Pretend about Budget Deficit</h2>
</center>
<p>
Here we go again. With Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole pondering a large tax cut proposal, many in the media are telling their viewers and readers that cutting taxes is inimical to balancing the budget.
<p>
"When you talk about a balanced budget and then you talk about big tax cuts, that's smoke and mirrors," argued NBC's Tim Russert, questioning House Speaker Newt Gingrich on the June 2 Meet the Press. "Bob Dole has been searching for a campaign issue that will mark clear-cut differences between himself and Mr. Clinton," stated ABC's Peter Jennings on the June 3 World News Tonight. But with taxes, "has Mr. Dole painted himself into a corner?" A week later, on the June 10 show, Jennings asked Dole in an interview: "Cutting taxes or the budget deficit, how can you do both?"
<p>
That doing both is impossible has been an article of faith for reporters for years. 
<p>
Since the 1980s, especially the late 1980s, reporters have repeatedly blamed budget deficits on tax cuts. In 1989 and 1990 they scolded George Bush for promising not to raise taxes and urged him to change his mind. On July 18, 1989, CBS Evening News reporter Mark Phillips, for instance, referred to "the stubborn budget deficit that most economists say will never be seriously reduced without the new taxes to which the President [Bush] remains opposed." 
<p>
"We cannot simply sidestep what is happening by resorting to old ideologies and new slogans," stated Mortimer Zuckerman in the February 6, 1989 U.S. News & World Report. Asked Zuckerman: "Who wants to read Bush's lips when to do so in the face of gigantic budget deficits means the slow decline of the America we know and believe in?" And correspondent Richard Threlkeld, on the October 16, 1990 CBS Evening News, opined: "So if and when they do sort out that deficit mess it's likely the rich are going to get soaked, at least a little, to make up for the soaking they avoided in the `80s."
<p>
But are tax cuts really such bad policy? Bruce Bartlett, a senior fellow at the National Center for Policy Analysis, points out in the May 27 Washington Times that when tax cut detractors are "asked for evidence that the American people suffered from [President] Reagan's tax cut, they have none to offer except the budget deficit."
<p>
This is a spurious argument, Bartlett maintains. "In fact, the tax cut had nothing whatsoever to do with the increase in federal budget deficits in the 1980s. On average, federal receipts as a share of GDP were higher in the 1980s than in the 1970s -- 19.0 percent of GDP versus 18.5 percent." According to Bart-lett, the deficit increase was caused by massive spending increases, with outlays increasing from 20.6 percent of GDP in the 1970s to 23.1 percent in the 1980s.
<p>
Bartlett demonstrates that real economic growth averaged 3.9 percent per year between 1982 and 1989, more than double the average for the 1990s. He also points out that "real median family income increased by $4,564 between 1982 and 1989, an increase of 12.6 percent, while it has fallen by $2,108, a decline of 5.2 percent in the low deficit 1990s."
<p>
If, as is most likely to be the case, tax cuts become part of the debate in this year's campaign, reporters should at least be skeptical of those who claim that they inevitably lead to higher deficits and other dreary economic outcomes.

<title>Issue Analysis: Are Some Risky Products More Newsworthy Than Others?</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Addicted to Tobacco Stories</h2>
</center>
<p>
The following is adapted from a Media Research Center special report, to be released later this summer, about news media coverage of risky products and the companies which make and sell them:
<p>
It is estimated that about 400,000 Americans die each year from smoking-related illnesses.
<p>
It is also estimated that about 300,000 Americans die each year from obesity-related illnesses. And studies show that fully one-third of Americans (75 million) are overweight.
<p>
Given these statistics, it's reasonable to assume that there are three news stories about dietary fat and the industries that sell products with dietary fat for every four news stories about tobacco and the tobacco industry, right?
<p>
Wrong. Media Research Center analysts counted every evening news story during the first six months of 1996 that had to do with tobacco and every evening news story during the same period that had to do with obesity and dietary fat. (Shows analyzed were ABC's World News Tonight, CBS Evening News, CNN's The World Today, and NBC Nightly News.) There were 138 stories about tobacco and the tobacco industry, all of which portrayed tobacco as a risky product. There were only 38 stories about dietary fat and obesity which portrayed fat as risky to consumers, a difference of almost four to one.
<p>
It's hard to escape the conclusion that tobacco has been singled out. Unlike fat, no angle of tobacco or of the tobacco industry went uncovered during the study period. There were reports, for example, about increases in teen smoking. NBC's Brian Williams, introducing a January 25 Nightly News story, told of  "a disturbing report out today on teenage smoking from the Centers for Disease Control. Despite all the pressures to stop, all the attempts to restrict cigarette sales, kids in much of this country are picking up the habit faster than ever." According to NBC's Bob Kur, in the same story, "Teenagers are part of 47 million smokers nationwide whose habit costs the country $50 billion in medical care." Bill Clinton's anti-tobacco photo-ops were also popular news stories. ABC's Peter Jennings, on the May 7 World News Tonight, reported that "President Clinton was in a New Jersey classroom warning that 3,000 teenagers start to smoke every day."
<p>
Another big tobacco story: The political donations of the industry and how those donations allegedly affected politicians' attitudes and actions toward tobacco. This was especially the case when Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole claimed that, for some people, smoking isn't addictive. Reason magazine senior editor Jacob Sullum, writing in the July 29 National Review, asserted that in such reports, the assumption usually is "that tobacco companies had given Dole and the Republican Party a lot of money, so he was clearly in league with the devil." According to Sullum, such reports assume the industry buys votes and never consider "the possibility that politicians...might get tobacco money because they support certain policies, rather than the other way around."
<p>
Sullum is right. Linda Douglass, for example, on the June 27 CBS Evening News told viewers that "Dole now is in the uncomfortable position of often siding with the tobacco industry just as cigarette makers are pumping unprecedented sums of money into the Republican Party." On that same night, NBC's Kur, after quoting the Clinton campaign's charge that Dole was toeing the tobacco industry line, pointed out, with a large on-screen graphic, that the industry "gave nearly $3 million in political contributions last year, 85 percent of the money to Republicans." 
<p>
There were also a great many stories about former tobacco industry executives and scientists admitting that they had known all along that nicotine is addictive, and numerous lawsuits against the tobacco industry were deemed of enough national importance to make the evening news.
<p>
In contrast, there were far fewer stories about fat and obesity and the industries which help produce them. Should tobacco really warrant so many more stories than fat? How dangerous is obesity? According to reporters themselves, it is quite dangerous. NBC's Tom Brokaw said, on the April 29 Nightly News, that "obesity, of course, is a major health problem in this country. It is estimated that it's responsible for 300,000 deaths a year from heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and the like." CBS's Jacqueline Adams, on the April 9 CBS Evening News, reported that "for years doctors have known that during pregnancy, obesity can cause serious problems like diabetes and bleeding for the mother. But according to two new studies in tomorrow's Journal of the American Medical Association, obesity in the mother can also cause serious problems for the fetus," including birth defects.
<p>
Even one high-fat meal can be dangerous, according to ABC's John McKenzie. On the May 9 World News Tonight, McKenzie told viewers about a study conducted at the University of Maryland in which researchers "found that after a high-fat meal, arteries, when required to handle an increased flow of blood, could expand on average only 50 percent of normal. It means that under conditions of stress and exertion, people who already have constricted arteries may not get enough blood to the heart."
<p>
So why so much more attention to the tobacco industry than to industries that produce fat? There were never any heated stories on the evening news about fast-food advertising enticing kids and others to consume products that may one day kill them. There were no reporters monitoring the political donations of fast-food restaurant chains and their trade associations. There were no stories in which reporters asked food-industry executives if they believed their products to be harmful. And there were no stories pointing out the medical-care costs of obesity.
<p>
Either the network evening news shows spend too much time covering tobacco or not enough covering the dangers of obesity and dietary fat. Either way, one politically incorrect product and industry is being singled out for intensive news coverage while other risky products and the industries which produce them are not.

<title>Kudos: Krulwich and Corporate Layoff Fears</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Kudos: Krulwich and Corporate Layoff Fears</h2>
</center>
<p>
All this year MediaNomics has reported on how the TV networks have overhyped the economic insecurity of American workers. A March study, for instance, showed that there had been 19 stories in the first two months of the year about layoffs, but only two about job growth. The June issue reported on how the media were ignoring an Inc. magazine\Gallup poll showing that most workers are quite secure and happy.
<p>
Finally, some reporters are starting to question the layoff legend. "The fears," said Forest Sawyer, in his introduction to a July 3 World News Tonight story, "are not always supported by the facts." 
<p>
Robert Krulwich, an economics correspondent for ABC News, continued: "Because we read every day about corporate layoffs and corporate downsizing and job anxiety, most of us now believe the world has changed...[but] what we all think is happening is not." According to Krulwich, "We Americans stay at our jobs about as long as we did 20 years ago. If you go back to 1973 to see how many folks had been at the same company for 10 years or more, for the younger group it was 28.8 percent and for the older group it was 45.1 percent. Now let's go forward to 1993, and look at this, the percentages are up, but very slightly. No big change at all."
<p>
He quoted Henry Farber, an economist at Princeton University: "And so what this is telling me is that there is basically just about as much job stability now as there was 20 years ago."
<p>
But then Krulwich tried to explain why people seem to feel more insecure now than they did in past decades. "Here's one possible explanation," Krulwich ventured. "Yeah, lots of people left jobs in 1973; lots of people left jobs in 1993. The numbers look the same...[but] there is some evidence that back in the 1970s more people happily quit their jobs for better pay, whereas today more people get fired." According to Krulwich, "Today people may stay at their jobs because they are afraid of losing their health insurance or their benefits, so they are stuck. Back then people maybe stayed on their jobs because they liked them."
<p>
This explanation conflicts, however, with the Inc. poll, which showed that 70 percent think management makes their workplaces great places to work, that 84 percent had opportunities to grow and learn at work, and that almost 70 percent thought they were paid fairly. This is not the picture of an unhappy work force.
<p>
While his diagnosis of worker attitudes may have been suspect, kudos to Krulwich for reporting the facts about job tenure.

<title>Labor Money Is OK</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Labor Money Is OK</h2></center>
<p>
Jackie Judd's report on the June 14 ABC World News Tonight warned of the close-knit nature of the relationships between, as anchor Peter Jennings put it, "politicians and the industries they are supposed to oversee." So far, so good. But their look at the ties of big business overlooked another group: Big Labor. 
<p>
Jennings introduced Judd's report: "Many politicians still like to wine and dine and travel on somebody else's tab." Judd focused on Democratic Senator Ernest Hollings, Republican Senator Larry Pressler, and House Republican Pat Roberts, who all accepted free travel from industries for which they chair committees. Of Hollings, Judd said: "As Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, he took half a dozen trips courtesy of industries his committee oversees." And of Roberts, Judd said: "The American Crop Association hosted him at the swanky Greenbrier resort in West Virginia, and the Dairy Foods Association flew Roberts to Miami for a four day trip."
<p>
Judd's findings were worthy of reporting, but she didn't go far enough. As with most stories about the influence of money in politics, Judd's only looked at business. Labor groups also finance junkets for those in Congress and spend lavishly on campaigns, but viewers were left in the dark about their activities. 
<p>
Judd also didn't ponder why industry finds it necessary to lobby in the first place: often to defend their turf from encroaching government power. What Judd sees as industry's cozy cronyism may be simply a method of survival in a regulatory age.

<title>Just Whom Does Big Business Support?</title>

<center><h2>Just Whom Does Big Business Support?</h2></center>
<p>
Reporters ignore actual donations, label conservatives as industry-backed
A burden of being a free market think tank or activist group in Washington must be knowing that TV network news typically ignores your work. What may be almost as bad is when network reporters cite the work of your free market group, but then sully its credibility by labeling the group "industry-supported."
<p>
It doesn't seem to matter to TV reporters that groups supporting expanded government policies actually receive more funding from corporations than do many of the free market think tanks. Nor does it seem to occur to reporters that some corporations may like, and profit from, big government policies more than from a free market.
<p>
Take CBS' Eric Engberg. On the June 21 CBS Evening News, Engberg reported on the efforts of conservatives in Congress to "defund the left," or stop the federal government from subsidizing the lobbying efforts of liberal advocacy groups. According to Engberg: "Right-leaning advocacy groups would be largely untouched by the legislation because they receive little federal aid and often have deep-pocketed backers in the business world."
<p>
Engberg failed to point out that many of the liberal groups which receive government money in fact have business backers with deeper pockets than those of most conservative groups. According to Stuart Nolan of the Capital Research Center, "Popular opinion incorrectly ties conservatives to big business, while liberals claim the moral high ground by championing 'the little guy.' In truth, however, big business tends to support conservative nonprofits only on legal issues and, to a lesser degree, on regulatory ones. Corporate America tends to fund liberals who specialize in women's, family, minority, and environmental issues."
<p>
According to Nolan's research, Corporate America donates over three times more to left-of-center groups than to right-of-center groups. Examples: AT&T financially supports such liberal groups as the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the Gay Men's Health Crisis, the NAACP, the National Council of La Raza, and the National Organization for Women (NOW).
<p>
And Times Mirror supports the Children's Defense Fund, the NAACP, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the National Urban League, and Planned Parenthood. Yet none of these industry supported groups are labeled as such by reporters. 
Conservative groups aren't so lucky. The latest example is the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI), a free market environmental group. While CEI does receive some of its funding from corporations, so do liberal environmental organizations, such as the Environmental Defense Fund and the National Audubon Society. That didn't stop two CBS reporters from placing only CEI in the same boat as "industry."
<p>
On the May 30 CBS Evening News, reporter Rita Braver (and Bill Plante on the May 31 This Morning), after reviewing President Clinton's objections to revisions of the Clean Water Act, referred to "industry groups and their supporters" before running a soundbite from CEI's Fred Smith. While Braver and Plante should be commended for interviewing Smith, liberal environmentalists who get more money from industry than CEI have escaped such labeling.
<p>
Industry is not a monolith. Some businesses support and prosper from free markets. Others do not and give money to groups which favor government activity in the marketplace. By missing this point, reporters unfairly tilt credibility against the think tanks and advocacy groups which support free markets in favor of those which do not.

<title>Lisa Myers: Ahead of the Pack</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Lisa Myers: Ahead of the Pack</h2></center>
<p>
NBC correspondent uncovers angles other Washington reporters miss
For some time now, NBC's Lisa Myers has been one of the most perceptive network news reporters based in Washington. Her beat is politics, but she brings to that calling an economics perspective which even some of the most seasoned business reporters lack.
<p>
Since the beginning of the year, Myers has spent most of her time covering the new Republican majority on Capitol Hill. She has been no knee-jerk partisan of the GOP. Often she challenges Hill leaders for practicing the same kind of old-fashioned politics they had claimed to repudiate in the November elections.
On the March 14 Nightly News, for instance, Myers took House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob Livingston to task for directing pork spending into his and other committee members' districts. "Bob Livingston preaches budget cutting with the fervor of a televangelist," Myers reported. "When critics charged that cuts victimized the poor, Livingston argued that the real victims today are taxpayers." 
<p>
But, she said, "he and his committee seem less concerned about reaching into taxpayers' pockets when it comes to their own pork barrel projects." After pointing out the nearly $3 billion Appropriations Committee members had steered to their own districts, Myers said the policy, though started by Democrats, "runs contrary to promises that this Republican Congress would be different."
On the May 23 Nightly News her target was Senatorial junkets. She described one junket in which five senators flew to Bali to visit a bamboo training center. She criticized both Republicans and Democrats, namely Senators Bennett Johnston, Alan Simpson, and self-proclaimed fiscal conservative Arlen Specter. She also detailed the extensive travels of one Congressman, supposedly to learn more about foreign policy issues, even though he sits on the Agriculture and Small Business Committees.
<p>
In contrast to many other political reporters in Washington, Myers also turns a skeptical eye toward many popular government programs. President Bill Clinton's pet program, Americorps, has received extremely favorable coverage from other networks. But Myers, on the February 16 Nightly News, looked at the facts. "Everyone agrees that what these young people are doing is worthwhile," Myers said. "The issue is whether it's a smart use of taxpayers' money. Critics insist it's not, that it's the last gasp of big government liberalism."
<p>
She pointed out that "an environmental project in Alaska costs taxpayers $42,000 per volunteer per year" and also that a grant of "$140,000 [went] to Northeastern University, [but] not a penny went for volunteers." She challenged a bureaucrat who helps run the program, finding that "even a top supervisor described Americorps as a jobs program," which "is not the way the Clinton Administration sold it to Congress."
<p>
On the May 25 Nightly News, Myers examined the federal government's program to subsidize America's sugar growers. According to her, "The sugar secret is hidden in many of your favorite foods: candy, cereal, even canned hams. The sugar growers like it that way. They get billions of dollars; you pay inflated prices and don't even know it, which is one reason the sugar program is one of the sweetest deals around."
<p>
Myers explained that "government price supports and import restrictions combine to drive up the cost of sugar in this country. This year the world price of sugar is 14 cents a pound. But U.S. growers get 22 cents a pound." She pointed out that the total cost to consumers is $1.4 billion a year and that most of the benefits go to large corporate sugar farmers rather than small family farmers.
<p>
On the June 13 Nighty News, Myers proved unafraid to investigate one of the most powerful lobbying forces for big government in America -- the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP). "If you think the AARP is some frail group of old people," she reported, "think again. In reality the AARP is one of the most influential voices in [Washington], trusted by 33 million members who are powerful because they vote as a bloc." She pointed out that most AARP money comes not from dues but from selling and endorsing products.
<p>
"However, an NBC News analysis found that while these products and endorsements are good business for the AARP," Myers said, "they are not always good deals for its members." She interviewed experts in such fields as investment banking and health insurance who told viewers that the AARP-sponsored products are usually not the best on the market and are overpriced because of the fee the AARP receives for products sold.
<p>
But it's Myers health care reporting which especially distinguishes her from many of her colleagues. While her beat is politics, and she therefore focuses on political angles, Myers nevertheless consistently brings up important economic facts which other reporters -- even economics reporters -- miss. In the previous Congressional term, for instance, when the Clinton Administration was proposing a sweeping health care program and assuring Americans that it knew how much the program would grow over the years, Myers looked at history and was skeptical.
<p>
On the September 29, 1993 Nightly News, Myers said: "When LBJ proposed [Medicare] he claimed it would cost $8 billion in 1990. The actual cost was $98 billion. Many health experts and economists are already challenging key assumptions of the Clinton plan."
<p>
The only other network reporter to point out the poor track record of government health care estimates, and how the government always underestimates rather than overestimates costs, was CBS's Ray Brady.
<p>
When, last year, the Democrats' favorite health care soundbite was that each American should get the same extravagant medical coverage as members of Congress, Myers kept her eye on the ball. On the June 21, 1994 Nightly News, she asked about such rhetoric: "And who will pay? One way or another, you will." 
<p>
And on this year's hottest health care issue, Medicare reform, Myers has again provided unique insights. The root problem of Medicare, according to Myers, is that "elderly Americans are getting far more in benefits than they ever paid in taxes. Fact: The average man retiring today will have paid about $24,000 in Medicare taxes and will get $85,000 in benefits. For women, who live longer, the difference is even greater: $25,000 in taxes compared with $104,000 in benefits." She is, so far, the only network reporter to point out the large disparities.
<p>
Myers, however, is no ideologue. In 1992 she gave less than charitable coverage to both Republican Presidential candidates, George Bush ("Even judged by the words of his own inaugural address, he comes up short.") and Pat Buchanan ("Pat Buchanan leads with anger."). She also has been critical of Republican plans to cut taxes and reform welfare. 
<p>
She is, above all, fair. She regularly does what good Washington reporters should, but don't usually, do: take skeptical looks at not just "waste," but at the programs government claims to run well, and remember that there are usually economic facts underneath every political story.

<title>Repeating NIH Press Releases</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<h2><center>Repeating NIH Press Releases</center></h2>
<p>
A widely circulated Washington Fax, published and edited by Bradie Metheny, confirms what many suspected: reporters often frame government spending stories along the lines of the press releases of the agencies affected. The fax noted that representatives of and those associated with the National Institutes of Health admit openly they manipulated media coverage to save funding for their agency. 
<p>
"Between May 7 and May 25," the fax reported, "biomedical research was featured in seven network news shows. ABC's Prime Time Live did a story on why funding for seemingly esoteric basic research is key to future advances in medicine. And on PBS, talk show host Charlie Rose interviewed researcher Paul Marks about the implications of the proposed cuts at NIH."
<p>
This same type of "if government doesn't do it who will" mentality was also prevalent in print media. According to the fax: "The New York Times editorial and Op-Ed pages both featured commentaries supporting a strong federal investment in biomedical research and science in general and condemning Republican budget proposals in this area. The Times also had a front-page story May 22 that said basic research was at risk in the battle over balancing the budget."
<p>
How did NIH manage such favorable coverage? "Much of the media activity was due to the efforts of the scientific community to focus attention on the budget cuts threatening NIH," reported the authors of the fax. "The New York Times coverage, for example, was in no small measure due to a lengthy phone call made from Washington state to the Times' board of editors by Jordan Cohen, president of the Association of American Medical Colleges."
<p>
The moral of the story: Public relations departments drive the news. Those wanting to cut government spending need to start working the phones.

<p>
Reporters Rail Against Legal Reform
<p>
Most observers of the media will agree that if there is one group to which almost all reporters are partial, it's victims. Reporters are eager to cover those who have been injured wrongfully or who have suffered injustices. Such profiles are commonplace in stories about nearly every political issue and often send powerful signals to viewers and readers about which side of an issue deserves sympathy.
<p>
Often this biases stories against free market policies. It is easy, after all, to interview those who get government benefits and who will, at least in the short term, suffer if the benefits are reduced. It's not as easy to interview a young person whose future is being mortgaged to pay for the government programs.
<p>
Current Congressional efforts to reform the U.S. legal system, therefore, present the media with an exceptional opportunity to be balanced. There are clear, identifiable victims on both sides of the tort reform issue. On the anti-reform side are those who have been harmed by a defective product and for whom the courts may be the only redress.
<p>
On the pro-reform side are the small business owners who have been forced to lay off workers or even go out of business because of frivolous lawsuits; as well as small business owners who have caved in to settlement demands in frivolous cases because they could not afford to defend themselves in court.
Despite this clear opportunity, reporters dropped the ball. Media- Nomics analysts reviewed every story about legal reform on each TV network's evening newscast during the first five months of this Congress. While reporters more than adequately covered the plights of those who have had to sue companies because of defective products, they did not interview or focus on a single small business owner or other victims of frivolous lawsuits. Reporters were also completely uninterested in exploring the economic costs of the current legal system.
<p>
Of the 19 legal reform stories that aired, eleven focused on neutral facts about recent Congressional action on legal reform, eight were explicitly critical of such reforms, and no story was critical of the status quo. Six of the eight stories critical of reform described how the status quo helps victims of defective products or medical malpractice. None probed how the status quo may hurt those who are targets of frivolous lawsuits.
<p>
The soundbites were similarly skewed. No business owner, small or large, was interviewed for a soundbite; only two representatives of business associations were interviewed. Five lawyers, by contrast, were interviewed for soundbites, as were four representatives of trial lawyers associations and five representatives of self-described consumer groups. Six stories carried soundbites from victims of defective products; none carried soundbites from victims of frivolous lawsuits. No story featured an interview with an economist, who could have told viewers of the economic benefits of legal reform.
<p>
Bob Faw's May 2 NBC Nightly News story was typical. "62-year-old sheet metal worker Ben Jones was a victim, not just of cancer, but of medical malpractice," Faw reported. "Four years ago doctors at this Fort Worth hospital bungled. Instead of removing Jones' cancerous left lung, they removed his healthy right lung." According to Faw, "The doctors also lied about what they had done and by the time Jones found out, it was too late. He died painfully and unnecessarily."
<p>
Faw interviewed the victim's widow, son, and attorney, plus a member of the American Medical Association (AMA). While the AMA member did point out that much of the money from malpractice awards goes to lawyers, Faw nonetheless concluded by wondering if "efforts to reign in lawyers will end up hurting the Jones'."
<p>
Similarly, on the March 10 CBS Evening News, Art Rascon profiled the case of a Florida boy who because of doctors' mistakes has been in a vegetative state for the past ten years. Because of a Florida law stating that damage awards over $200,000 must be approved by the state legislature, Rascon explained, the boy's family hasn't received any money. "So little Justin still lies in bed," Rascon concluded, "the victim of not only a tragic medical mistake, but of a legal and political system that has yet to resolve the fate of this 11-year-old boy."
<p>
One reporter, ABC's Tim O'Brien, seemed especially hostile to reform. On the March 7 World News Tonight, O'Brien downplayed worries of a litigation explosion and said that "making the loser pay the winner's legal expenses may reduce the number of lawsuits, but most consumer groups insist only the wealthy could sue." O'Brien only interviewed representatives of the Association of Trial Lawyers and of Consumer Action.
<p>
Two days later, on the March 9 World News Tonight, O'Brien again interviewed a narrow range of sources, this time only a representative of Public Citizen, a consumer group backed by trial lawyers. O'Brien and his source, Public Citizen's Joan Claybrook, tried to play down the abuse of punitive damages in product liability lawsuits.
<p>
According to O'Brien most of the large awards which make headlines are later reduced on appeal. "Consumer groups insist the mere threat of punitive damage awards benefits the public," O'Brien said. He never gave the other side: The mere threat of punitive damages also causes many wrongfully accused firms to settle cases because it's cheaper than litigating, even if they win.
<p>
On the March 13 World News Tonight, O'Brien focused on what effect legal reform would have on malpractice lawsuits. His story focused on Willie King, a patient who had the wrong foot amputed by doctors. Viewers heard from King, his attorney, and the president of the Trial Lawyers of America. Said O'Brien: "[King's] lawyer says Congress should be making doctors more accountable for mistakes, not less."
<p>
Missing from O'Brien's story was, for instance, an economist who could have told viewers that large malpractice awards cause everyone's insurance rates to go up. Reporters in general ignored economists who could have informed viewers of the economic benefits which most experts think legal reform would usher in.
No one on either side of the debate would argue that those injured by faulty products shouldn't have the right to seek redress in court; and Faw, Rascon, and O'Brien were not wrong to focus attention on such victims. 
<p>
But legal reform is a complex issue. As with most other political issues, the economic ramifications of legal reform have not been explored by reporters. And anecdotes about victims of defective products and services were not balanced by reports on another set of victims whose stories need to be told: the wrongfully accused small business owners who are often hurt by the current system. Viewers need to know that there are victims on both sides of the legal reform issue if they are to be well-informed.

<Title>Service Jobs Stereotyped by Brady</Title>
</Head>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<center><h2>Service Jobs Stereotyped by Brady</h2>
</center>
<p>
Ray Brady, CBS's economics correspondent, would be a great economics analyst -- if this were the 19th century. For Brady the only good job is manufacturing job. His rhetoric would have you think that service jobs are something akin to slavery, with most of the jobs created since the 1980s being for hamburger flippers. This vastly underestimates the power of the late- 20th century American economy to create good service jobs.
<p>
On the July 7 CBS Evening News, Brady reported on a drop in the unemployment rate that "on the surface, it looks like good news, but if you dig into the numbers, they're really not that great." Why? Because "we're losing manufacturing jobs, which are high paying, and we're adding amusement park kinds of jobs, which don't pay much."
<p>
This is nothing new for Brady, who has been bashing service jobs for years. On March 10, 1989, he reported that "in today's figures, the big job increase is in low-paying service industry jobs" while a graphic of a teen flipping burgers was on the screen. Good employment news on September 4, 1992 was tempered by losses in "manufacturing, the industry that's the heartbeat of the economy."
<p>
On March 5, 1993, Brady reported that "there was hardly any growth in high paying manufacturing jobs," only in service jobs, which "don't pay what the old jobs did." And on March 4, 1994, Brady reported that despite a drop in unemployment, "still, the biggest winners came in low-paying service jobs."
<p>
But just how bad are service jobs. According to National Review's Ed Rubenstein, service jobs include "positions in law, advertising, computers, and medicine." During the 1980s, he reported, "only 12 percent of the increase in employment occurred in the lowest-paid, low-skilled service occupations such as retailing and fast-food restaurants." And what about the 1990s? According to NBC's Tom Brokaw, on the January 30 Nightly News, "The Census Bureau today said that [computer] software is by far the fastest growing part of the service economy."
<p>
So Brady and other reporters should take a good look at the wide range of service jobs before stereotyping them as "amusement park kinds of jobs." Most of the new service workers do just fine.

<Title>Reporters Promote Corporate Welfare </Title>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<center><h2>Reporters Promote Corporate Welfare </h2>
</center>
<p>
Journalists don't question Administration officials' defense of business pork 
The corporate welfare state has found presumably unwitting allies in the media. Despite the Clinton Administration's stated policy of being against federal subsidies for business, reporters haven't challenged Administration officials to explain their defense of business pork against budget cutters.
<p>
CNN's Charles Bierbauer, for example, on the July 4 World News reported on the threatened elimination of the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration (USTTA). Introducing the story, anchor Bobbie Battista described USTTA as "the small federal agency set up to lure tourists to the U.S....now on the chopping block." 
<p>
Bierbauer quoted Greg Farmer, Undersecretary of the Commerce Department, defending the program: "There's a new job created every 2.5 seconds in the travel and tourism industry in the world. I want the United States to get its fair share." He didn't ask Farmer if this made USTTA an example of corporate welfare. Bierbauer concluded his segment by saying that "tourists will continue to come to the United States, of course, but they may no longer have Uncle Sam to lead them here."
<p>
Another network reporter who let corporate welfare go unchallenged was John Roberts, who warned, on the June 25 CBS Evening News, of federal summer job programs being hurt by Republican budget cuts. "For the past 30 years," Roberts said, "kids from low income families have had help from the federal summer jobs program, which funds student employment."  Concluding his story, Roberts said: "[Labor Secretary Robert] Reich points out that one-third of disadvantaged kids who get summer jobs in the private sector wind up working for the same companies in permanent jobs."
<p>
But, if that's the case, isn't a federal program that forces taxpayers to subsidize the training costs of businesses a prime example of corporate welfare, which Reich claims to oppose? Roberts didn't ask the Labor Secretary. 
<p>
A July 2 Washington Post story lacked similar insights. "Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown, a strong advocate of free trade, today expressed confidence 'cooler heads will ultimately prevail' and his department will not be dismantled by Republicans in Congress," according to the Post.
<p>
"As Commerce Secretary, Brown has made U.S. exports a cornerstone of his department, leading trips abroad with American businessmen in hopes of prying open overseas markets." The Post quoted Brown: "It's unbelievable that the United States would be the only country in the world where the private sector would not have a seat at the Cabinet table."
<p>
The Post didn't speculate that the Commerce Department may itself embody corporate welfare. Nor did the Post give any non-Administration views, such as those of economist Murray Weidenbaum of the Center for the Study of American Business. "The current management of the Department boasts that it is especially effective in using its vast resources to help individual companies succeed in an increasingly competitive global marketplace," Weidenbaum said in his testimony to the House Commerce Committee.
<p>
"Of course, the relatively few who benefit from the Secretary of Commerce personally opening doors for them think this is a great idea," Weidenbaum said. "Millions of other businesses, large and small, however, pay the taxes that finance these programs. They do not benefit from this personal attention. In a nutshell, this whole process is unfair." According to Weidenbaum, most American businesses and the American economy would be better off if the money spent by the Commerce Department went to lower taxes or reduce the deficit.
<p>
Remarkably, reporters who were quick to publicize the Administration's crusade to end corporate welfare aren't suspicious when the same Administration claims it can help private companies create jobs and train employees.

<center><h2>Kudos: Post Looks at Regulations from Business Perspective</h2>
</center>
<p>
The concerns of small business owners rarely make it into the stories of the Washington media (See page 2). A notable exception: the July 17 Washington Post. Staff writer Jay Matthews, in a front page story, describes how the federal regulatory maze causes one small business, the Drypers Corporation, to "fear" and "shudder" at the cost of compliance. According to Matthews, that fear can now be remedied by "a Republican led Congress [that] tries to rewrite and scale back what businesses consider irrational intrusions." Matthews gives readers a "close look at Drypers' multi-layered relationship with Washington [which] helps explain the resentment that drives this [deregulatory] campaign."
<p>
The story quotes Walter Klemp, chairman of the Texas-based diaper company, as fearing almost any new government action. Referring to the last time Congress changed tax laws, he asks: "How many volumes and rooms of tax code did they add to the whole thing the last time?" Matthews notes that "Drypers must calculate its income in one way for the [Securities and Exchange Commission] and its shareholders and in quite another way for the [Internal Revenue Service]." Other "conflicting rules" which "almost no one reads" include "a federal law that requires a plan to reduce its employees' commuting time while a state law says the company does not have to put the plan into effect." Such conflicting rules require Drypers' management to neglect their "families for weeks to produce stacks of reports," causing Klemp to declare that "government has tried too much to work social issues through business."
<p>
While Matthews didn't point out the cost of excessive regulations for consumers and society (See Editor's Note, page 8), kudos to him and the Post for reporting on how overregulation does hurt small, struggling business owners.
<p>
 MediaNomics noted recently that NBC's Lisa Myers has been emerging as one of the most original network reporters. During July, the trend continued. Last month Myers reported again on sugar subsidies for Dateline. She pointed out that the program costs consumers while a limited number of sugar growers get billions in subsidies.
<p>
Then, in a Nightly News story, she returned to the Medicare debate. Myers reported again that most recipients receive much more in benefits than they paid into the program and that Medicare's explosive growth wasn't predicted by its founders.
<p>
Myers' fact-based reporting continues to clear up the often foggy entitlements debate.

<title>Reporters Ignore Those Who Support Tax Cuts</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Economists Unanimous on Taxes? </h2>
</center>
<p>
Reporters seem to think they have found something others have been trying to find for years -- a consensus among economists.  Journalists in both the print and broadcast media are reporting that "most economists" are against Dole's tax cuts. But a recent study that actually surveyed economists finds much less agreement than the media are conveying.
<p>
"Bob Dole says his new economic plan will carry America `to the threshold of a breathtaking future.' But to many economists, it looks like `Back to the Future,'" wrote the Boston Globe's Peter G. Gosselin on August 6. "For all Dole's claims about the innovativeness of his proposal analysts said that it relies on two tried-and-troubled ideas -- spending cuts like those balked at by the public last year, and an economic payoff largely missing from the nation's last experiment with substantial tax cuts under Ronald Reagan."
<p>
Clay Chandler, in the August 6 Washington Post, agreed: "Economists, investors and budget experts yesterday questioned the validity of those assumptions and the budget numbers underlying Dole's ambitious claims." He quoted Norwest Corp.'s chief economist, Song Won Sohn, as saying, "If we were to put in a package like this, I'm concerned that income growth effects would be negative, not positive."
<p>
Broadcast reporters were equally adamant. NBC's David Bloom, on August 5, said: "Most economists say the Reagan tax cuts did worsen the budget deficit and many are skeptical of Dole's plan." 
<p>
It turns out not to be so clear, though. Professor William C. Adams of George Washington University conducted a nationwide survey of 700 members of the American Economics Association. According to Adams, the survey found "an unexpected degree of sympathy for tax cuts" as well as "an enormous diversity of opinion and no profession-wide consensus on these key issues." (See box.)
<p>
About the same percentage of economists, for instance, think federal spending caused the increased deficits of the 1980s (52) as think Reagan's tax cuts were the culprit (48). More than eight out of ten, though, agree that Reagan's tax cuts increased economic growth. A sizable minority of economists (41 percent) think Dole's plan to recapture 30 percent of the revenue lost from his tax cut through faster economic growth -- the classic supply-side argument -- is plausible. 
<p>
According to the survey, the closest thing to a consensus among economists concerns reining in spending. When asked their preferred priorities for the next Congress, a plurality (42 percent) picked cutting taxes and restraining spending. Thirty four percent chose restraining spending. In other words, a full 76 percent favor restraining spending, a story still waiting to be told in the news.

<title>Issue Review: Coverage of Business Subsidies</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Schizophrenic on Corporate Welfare</h2>
</center>
<p>
When General Colin Powell, in his speech at the Republican National Convention, challenged his party to rein in corporate welfare and not just other parts of government, reporters responded approvingly. But a look at their own past record in coverage (or lack of coverage) of subsidies to business and industry reveals that reporters themselves need to start challenging both parties on the issue.
<p>
"One of the things that I thought was interesting about Colin Powell's speech," commented MSNBC correspondent Andrea Mitchell, "is that he did talk about the hard choices and he said, `Listen friends, let me put it to you. We're going to have to give up corporate welfare as well.'" PBS anchor Charlayne Hunter-Gault said to the Family Research Council's Gary Bauer: "You heard the reaction in the room at the conclusion of the speech. You also heard Mark [Shields] say that when he talked about corporate welfare and welfare for the wealthy there was a deafening silence in the room. How do you think this crowd is really receiving this message?"
<p>
As important is how the media have received this message. For while they are interested in corporate welfare now, the real deafening silence has been in the media's coverage of business subsidies. As reported by MediaNomics in past issues, reporters over the last several months have often either ignored corporate welfare when it was a major part of a prominent issue, or they have actually promoted business subsidies.
<p>
Example: Last summer when some budget cutters in Congress were trying to cut business pork, reporters came to the rescue. CNN's Charles Bierbauer, for example, on the July 4, 1995 World News, reported on the threatened elimination of the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration (USTTA). Introducing the story, anchor Bobbie Battista described the USTTA as "the small federal agency set up to lure tourists to the U.S....now on the chopping block."
<p>
Bierbauer quoted Greg Farmer, undersecretary of commerce, defending the program: "There's a new job created every 2.5 seconds in the travel and tourism industry in the world. I want the United States to get its fair share." Is the USTTA corporate welfare? Bierbauer didn't ask. Bierbauer's conclusion: "Tourists may continue to come to the United States, of course, but they may no longer have Uncle Sam to lead them here."
<p>
John Roberts, on the June 25, 1995 CBS Evening News, warned that budget cuts may hurt summer jobs programs. "For the past 30 years," Roberts said, "kids from low-income families have had help from the federal summer jobs program, which funds student employment." Roberts quoted Labor Secretary Robert Reich as pointing out that "one-third of disadvantaged kids who get summer jobs in the private sector wind up working for the same companies in permanent jobs." So does taxpayer funding of businesses training costs constitute corporate welfare? Roberts didn't ask Reich.
<p>
A July 2, 1995 Washington Post story assumed the Commerce Department was necessary and didn't bother interviewing critics who were calling it the embodiment of corporate welfare. The entire story was from the point of view of then-Commerce Secretary Ron Brown. According to the Post, Brown, "a strong advocate of free trade, today expressed confidence `cooler heads will ultimately prevail' and his department will not be dismantled by Republicans in Congress."
<p>
The Post said the secretary had been "leading trips abroad with American businessmen in hopes of prying open overseas markets" and quoted Brown as saying that "it's unbelievable that the United States would be the only country in the world where the private sector would not have a seat at the cabinet table." The Post didn't give any space to non-administration views, such as those of economist Murray Weidenbaum of the Center for the Study of American Business. "Of course, the relatively few who benefit from the Secretary of Commerce personally opening doors for them think this is a great idea," Weidenbaum told the House Commerce Committee. "Millions of other businesses, large and small, however, pay the taxes that finance these programs. They do not benefit from this personal attention. In a nutshell, this whole process is unfair."
<p>
Sometimes journalists simply ignored corporate welfare altogether, even when it was part of an issue they were covering. This past spring, for example, most reporters accepted at face value the Clinton Adminstration's expensive plan to restore parts of the Florida Everglades. The fact that federal subsidies, supported by both the Clinton Administration and Republicans in Congress, were propping up the same sugar industry which threatened the Everglades rarely merited a mention.
<p>
The Clinton plan is "the largest infusion of federal dollars ever proposed for the Everglades, making it one of the biggest ecological restoration projects ever," cheered CBS News correspondent Art Rascon on the February 20 This Morning. Miami correspondent Peter Katel, in the March 4 Newsweek, added that "Clinton's plan is the high-water mark of reform. Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole and Florida's two senators have a more modest plan to spend $200 million of taxpayer funds -- not sugar money -- to buy some of the sugarcane land for water-restoration projects." On February 20 reporter Mike Clary of the Los Angeles Times called Clinton's plan "as ambitious and comprehensive as any environmental project of recent years."
<p>
But none of these reporters made the connection between the subsides provided to industry by the sugar tariff and damage to the Everglades. None asked why the government, before spending a lot of money, shouldn't just bring down the tariff. Only Eric Schmitt of the New York Times criticized the subsidies. "The government sets price supports that maintain domestic sugar prices at twice those on the world market and, according to the General Accounting Office, cost consumers $1.4 billion a year," Schmitt pointed out. "Strict quotas on cheaper foreign sugar maintain the support price levels, which critics say benefit a small number of wealthy plantation owners and encourage overproduction in environmentally sensitive areas like the Florida Everglades."
<p>
Such subsidies to business constitute some of the least defensible of federal spending programs. Although neither Republican nor Democratic politicians want to talk about corporate welfare, it has critics outside of Congress and the Clinton Administration on both the right and the left. Reporters generally cheered Colin Powell for bringing up corporate welfare in his convention speech. But when it comes to specific programs, they have usually been slow to mention corporate welfare's critics and quick to assume that business subsidies are justified.

<center><h2>Kudos: NBC's Lisa Myers and Andrea Mitchell</h2>
</center>
<p>
One of the encouraging recent trends on the evening newscasts is the development of regular segments in which reporters explore how the government often misspends taxpayers' money. As recent coverage has demonstrated, NBC Nightly News' version, "The Fleecing of America," has proven to be one of the best.
<p>
The July 10 "Fleecing of America" segment told viewers how the Social Security Administration spends tax money for union representatives who, as Tom Brokaw said, "do no work on Social Security matters." According to correspondent Lisa Myers: "Taxpayers are paying the salaries of 146 full-time employees who do not work on Social Security matters and instead spend all of their time on union activities," as well as another 1,800 who spend part of their work time engaged in union tasks. Myers reported that "under President Clinton, the cost of these union activities has doubled to almost $13 million a year."
<p>
She interviewed former SSA employees who told of the union workers' using their jobs, and therefore tax money, to promote the Democratic Party, and confronted an SSA official about such partisan ties. "This is not happening just at the Social Security Administration," she concluded, "but in virtually every other federal agency."
<p>
Correspondent Andrea Mitchell, for the August 7 segment, told viewers about an "expensive new Medicare handbook, courtesy of the U.S. Government." According to Mitchell: "The handbook is supposed to describe Medicare benefits and where to get help, basic information. It cost $2.1 million to distribute last year. But this year, an election year, it cost nine times as much -- $18 million."
<p>
Mitchell pointed out that "critics wonder, was the chief reason for this year's big cost increase politics." One of those critics, Rep. Bill Thomas, (R-Calif.) said, "The primary goal was to create a positive, warm feeling in an election year with taxpayers' dollars."
<p>
Mitchell pointed out that "a separate copy went to every American over 65. That's 37 million copies," which went even to married seniors whose spouses received a copy. She pointed out that, despite the high cost, the handbook didn't even mention one of the new programs Medicare recipients are eligible for and concluded that to many, "it reads like another chapter in the fleecing of America."
<p>
Kudos to Myers, Mitchell, and NBC for holding government to the same standards reporters have long held the private sector.

<title>Guest Review, by Linda E. Platts</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Where Science Meets Politics</h2>
</center>
<p>
Science and technology are now major players in the public policy arena. While much of the media ignore the science behind many political issues, at least one show takes it on squarely. TechnoPolitics, a half-hour public television show, is helping its viewers make sense out of technical information and also see how the policies that evolve will affect their lives.
<p>
Hosted by James K. Glassman, a Washington Post columnist who also hosts CNN's Capital Gang Sunday, TechnoPolitics is designed to "distinguish the science from the politics in policy debates," according to the producers. Thus, it deals with issues such as electronic communications, air defense, fat substitutes, medical research, and global warming.
<p>
The show delves into one topic at length and then follows with a briefer look at two other subjects. Film clips provide background information usually followed by a debate by experts representing both sides of the issue.
<p>
What distinguishes TechnoPolitics from other shows dealing with topical issues is its willingness to air views that get short shrift elsewhere. In a recent show, the World Bank came under close scrutiny. It is supported by the American taxpayers to the tune of $789 million a year and relies on the American government to guarantee its loans. Glassman dug in with queries on the bank's hefty salaries, its new $314 million headquarters, and its often risky loans, which no private bank would consider.
<p>
For another show, TechnoPolitics tackled pornography on the Internet. One side weighed in with the view that children must be protected at all costs and government control is essential. The opposing side suggested parents should do their jobs, rather than allow the government to gain a foothold on the free flow of information over the Internet. Another emotionally charged issue tackled recently by TechnoPolitics was medical research using animals. News footage with an animal rights activist and a patient battling AIDS introduced the segment, then in the studio two scientists presented contradictory "scientific" evidence. There were no clear winners or losers in this debate, but it highlighted the complexity of making public policy about animal testing.
<p>
Whether the subject is a replacement for the F-16 or saving human lives, TechnoPolitics doesn't shy away from the hard issues. The joint strike fighter, for instance, is intended to meet the needs of all the military services, but the development time, as Glassman noted, stretched well into the next century. Even more attention to the costs behind the science would be a welcome addition.
<p>
The last segment of each show does not examine an issue so much as raise an interesting subject. A New York Times reporter told how alternative medicines can deter patients from seeking effective treatment from conventional sources. A writer from Scientific American explained that all great scientific discoveries have already been made and from now on we will just be refining the details. Interesting, yes, but there is no debate and viewers are left in limbo waiting for the point that is never made. TechnoPolitics might be better leaving these stories to another program and sticking with the clear, rapid exchange of views that distinguishes the earlier portions of the program.
<p>
TechnoPolitics is produced by the Blackwell Corporation in association with South Carolina Educational Television and it is distributed by the Public Broadcasting System. It is broadcast on 180 stations and reaches 40 of the top 50 markets. It airs on Sunday mornings in most markets.

<Title>Tax Cuts Concern Reporters, Medicare Increases Don't</Title>
</Head>
<Body BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<center><h2>Deficit Chicken Hawks</h2>
</center>
<p>
Bob Dole pledged to cut income taxes by 15 percent, balance the
budget, and leave Social Security and Medicare untouched. Toughminded
reporters believed none of it and shared their skepticism with
a national television audience,&quot; writes the Weekly Standard's
David Frum in the September 9 issue of that magazine.
<P>
But then, according to Frum, &quot;Two weeks later, the Democrats met in
convention and, to put it simply, lied through their teeth about
their plans for Medicare. They accused Republicans, in Al Gore's
words, of wanting to `give health insurance ripoff artists a license
to change Medicare, to let this program for our seniors wither
on the vine. That's why they want to replace Bill Clinton. But
we won't let them.' Those remarks are blatantly untrue, both about
the Republican plans and about Clinton's own. And the media said...nothing.&quot;
<P>
Is Frum correct? Are reporters more skeptical of Bob Dole's tax rhetoric
than of Bill Clinton's Medicare rhetoric? Media Research Center
analysts reviewed all of the stories about either tax cuts or
Medicare on ABC's World News Tonight, CBS Evening News, NBC Nightly
News, and CNN's World Today during the month of August. The MRC's
findings: While network journalists were ardent deficit hawks
when reporting on tax cuts, they lost their deficitcutting zeal
when Democrats denounced Republican Medicare plans.There were
a total of 24 stories during the month that questioned whether
Bob Dole could both cut taxes and balance the budget. Only two
stories questioned whether Bill Clinton could erase the deficit
while not advancing Medicare reforms in his second term.The reaction
to the unveiling of Dole's tax plan was the same across the networks.
&quot;Since Dole would leave Social Security, Medicare, and defense
untouched,&quot; reported CBS News correspondent Phil Jones, &quot;it's
still unclear what would be cut in order to pay for his tax cut.&quot;
According to CNN's Gene Randall, &quot;Bob Dole has produced an
economic plan that is getting mixed reviews even from Republicans.
The bipartisan Concord Coalition on Sunday warned against electionyear
taxcut Santas.&quot;
<P>
NBC's Mike Jensen offered that &quot;most
analysts say it's not good economics. Bob Dole says about a fourth
of the tax cuts would be paid for by an expanding economy, but
the rest would have to come from spending cuts, and those haven't
been spelled out yet.&quot; Over at ABC, correspondent John Cochran
claimed that &quot;if critics say Dole's tax plan would lead to
budget deficits of the size of those dating back to the Reagan
era, then his campaign simply isn't going to worry about it for
now.&quot;
<P>
But what about Bill Clinton and Medicare? Economics
columnist Robert Samuelson, in the September 4 Washington Post,
pointed out that in the upcoming years &quot;the only way to avoid
(or minimize) much higher taxes, the [Congressional Budget Office]
said, would be a mix of an older retirement age, reduced benefits
and a shift of Medicare toward managed care. On Medicare, the
Republicans proposed precisely such a shift...Clinton's demolition
of this effort confounds the CBO's sensible advice.&quot;
<P>
Only
two network reporters questioned whether leaving Medicare alone
could be compatible with balanced budgets. &quot;A generation
of baby boomers begins retiring within a decade,&quot; ABC's Jerry
King pointed out. &quot;So, the bad news is, unless the politicians
find a way to cut entitlement spending, today's deficit reductions
will be impossible to sustain.&quot; ABC's Jeff Greenfield reported
that &quot;with the huge baby boomer generation retiring in about
15 years, those entitlement programs could take every single dollar
of the budget.&quot;
<P>
King and Greenfield were the only reporters
concerned about how to &quot;pay for&quot; automatic Medicare
spending increases. If Bill Clinton won't reform Medicare in his
next term, why aren't reporters asking him which taxes he will
raise?

<Title>Issue Analysis: The Media Versus Tobacco</Title>
</Head>
<Body BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<center><h2>Addicted to Tobacco Stories, Part II</h2>
</center>
<p>
 Which is worse, a legal product that if used over many decades can be lifethreatening,
or an illegal product that can be of more immediate danger?
<P>
For
America's news media, the answer is overwhelmingly the former.
Over a recent twelvemonth period, television news has devoted
significantly more air time to reporting on tobacco than to reporting
on cocaine, heroin, LSD, and marijuana combined.
<P>
This is one finding
of a special yearlong Media Research Center study of news coverage
of risky products and the industries which make and sell them.
Tobacco and the tobacco industry received more negative coverage
by far than any other risky legal product, such as dietary fat
and the food industry, automobiles and the auto industry, alcohol
and the alcohol industry, and pesticides and the chemical industry.
Tobacco even received more coverage than illegal drugs. This media
obsession with tobacco affected coverage of other issues as well,
even coverage of the 1996 presidential campaign. 
<P>
Media Research
Center analysts reviewed all of the stories about several risky
products on network morning and evening news shows between August
1, 1995 and August 1, 1996. There were 413 stories during that
twelvemonth period about tobacco; there were 340 stories about
illegal drugs. This disparity was present despite welldocumented
rapid increases in the use of illegal drugs over the past few
years, notably among teenagers.
<P>
Among the print media, the disparity
has been even greater. A Nexis search of headlines in American
newspapers finds that the terms &quot;tobacco or smoking or cigarette&quot;
were employed 26,546 times between January 1, 1993 and September
9, 1996. Over the same time period, the terms &quot;cocaine or
heroin or LSD or illegal drugs&quot; were used only 8,501 times.
In other words, there were more than three times as many stories
focusing on tobacco than there were stories focusing on illegal
drugs.
<P>
President Clinton has helped put the tobacco story on the
map. Eightyfive of the television news tobacco stories were about
the Clinton Administration's attacks on the tobacco industry.
Almost all of the stories were upbeat about Clinton's attempts
to regulate tobacco, portraying him as courageously taking on
a powerful industry. NBC's Bryant Gumbel, for instance, announced
on the August 11, 1995 Today that &quot;in a historic move the
Clinton Administration has declared nicotine to be a drug and
has proposed regulations aimed at curbing smoking by teenagers.&quot;
According to CBS' John Roberts, on the August 10, 1995 This Morning,
&quot;President Clinton is stepping up federal efforts to harness
smoking among teenagers. He'll detail some tough new measures
today that are sure to put him at odds with the powerful tobacco
lobby.&quot;
<P>
But when the issue was the increases in illegal drug
use, Clinton was mentioned only in 45 stories, and most of those
mentions were positive. Again, the disparity is revealing. The
same reporters who are willing to accept Clinton's premise that
government policies can discourage smoking behavior among the
young demand little accountability from him for increased illegal
drug use. And there was rarely even the suggestion in the media
that the president was playing up the tobacco issue to hide how
much illegal drug use had increased during his watch.
<P>
Among the
print media, the same disparity was present. A Nexis search reveals
that there were 4,057 stories between January 1, 1993 and September
9, 1996 that had &quot;tobacco or smoking or cigarette&quot; in
the headline and a reference to Bill Clinton in the body of the
story. Stories with the terms &quot;cocaine or heroin or LSD or
illegal drugs&quot; in the headline and a reference to Clinton
in the body of the story numbered 381.
<P>
This singling out of tobacco
had effects on 1996 campaign coverage. Normally, when a politician
radically changes positions on an issue, it's big news. For instance,
there were several evening news stories during the 1996 Republican
National Convention about Jack Kemp altering his positions on
illegal immigration and affirmative action once he became the
Republican vicepresidential candidate. &quot;
<P>
The quarterback became
the acrobat today,&quot; reported ABC's Jackie Judd on the August
14, 1996 World News Tonight. &quot;Kemp was flipflopping on long
held positions.&quot; She noted that these changes &quot;left
at least one delegate here feeling abandoned&quot; and that &quot;Kemp's
change in position on these core issues fights the very image
that he's built for himself as an independent thinker.&quot; According
to Dan Rather, on that same night's CBS Evening News, &quot;Bob
Dole has reversed himself on deficit reduction versus tax cuts.
Jack Kemp has reversed himself on how he feels about immigration.&quot;
Rather wondered: &quot;Isn't that, or is it, going to make it
more difficult to attack Bill Clinton on the character issue?&quot;
<P>
But
these bloodhounds sniffing out hypocrisy turned quiet when Vice
President Al Gore radically changed his position on tobacco. In
his speech to the Democratic National Convention, Gore said that
his sister's death from lung cancer in 1984 prompted his antitobacco
crusade. None of the network evening newscasts pointed out that
in 1988, he boasted to tobacco growers that &quot;throughout most
of my life, I raised tobacco. I want you to know that with my
own hands, all of my life, I put it in the plant beds and transferred
it. I've hoed it. I've dug it in. I've sprayed it, I've chopped
it, I've shredded it, spiked it, put it in the barn and stripped
it and sold it.&quot; Apparently, politicians changing their positions
cannot go unpunished by the media unless they result in the politician
becoming an antitobacco zealot.
<P>
The disparity between tobacco and
other legal products was even greater. On television  during the
same time period in which there were 413 stories about tobacco
 there were 136 stories about dietary fat and obesity; there were
94 stories about auto safety; there were only 58 stories related
to alcohol and health.As MediaNomics reported two months ago,
the disparity between reporting on tobacco and reporting on dietary
fat and obesity is especially curious. The same health advocates
who tell us that tobacco contributes to 400,000 deaths in the
U.S. each year also report that obesity contributes to 300,000
deaths in the U.S. per year. Reporters acknowledged this risk.
&quot;Obesity, of course, is a major health problem in this country,&quot;
Tom Brokaw reported on the April 29, 1996 Nightly News. &quot;It
is estimated that it's responsible for 300,000 deaths a year from
heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes and the like.&quot;
Other reporters pointed out that obesity during pregnancy can
cause birth defects and other serious problems in babies. One
reporter, ABC's John McKenzie, insisted that even one highfat
meal, if eaten at an inopportune moment, can be dangerous. But
there were still only onefourth the number of stories on obesity
and dietary fat as there were stories about tobacco. 
<P>
There was
also a different standard of judgment for the industries that
make and sell other risky products. They were never subjected
to nearly the same hostility that the tobacco industry endured.
There were no stories, for example, about fastfood advertising
enticing kids and others to consume products that may one day
kill them. Nor were there any stories pointing out the medical
costs of obesity. And no network reporter sought to outline the
campaign contributions of companies which produce and sell alcohol.
But all the networks were critical of tobacco advertising and
campaign contributions, as well as the medical costs to society
of smokingrelated illnesses.
<P>
Journalists seem to have lost some
perspective when reporting on tobacco. They not only air far more
stories on tobacco than on other legal, risky products, but they
have allowed Clinton to use smoking to deflect attention from
rising illegal drug use. Reporters should not ignore tobacco,
but they should not apply to it a harsher standard than they apply
to even illegal drugs.Editor's note: This issue analysis is adapted
from a longer Media Research Center special report about media
coverage of both legal and illegal risky products and the industries
which produce them.

<Title>Guest Editorial, by Laurence A. Jarvik</Title>
</Head>
<Body BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<center><h2>PBS: Already Commercial</h2>
</center>
<p>
In all of the heated debate about privatizing
public broadcasting, one observation has struck me most forcefully
about PBS: It is a fact seldom commented upon that many PBS shows
have had their roots firmly fixed in commercial soil from their
inception. Many of public television's bestknown offerings are
either transfers from the networks, adaptations from them (often
using the same personnel), or purchases (on a commercial basis)
from British television companies (including such forprofit competitors
of the BBC as Thames Television).
<P>
The <I>MacNeil-Lehrer Report</I>, for
instance, was produced by a team from NBC News and resembled the
<I>Huntley-Brinkley</I> Report. Bill Moyers shuttled between PBS and <I>CBS
News</I>. William F. Buckley's <I>Firing Line</I> had run on RKO General
stations before moving to PBS. <I>Frontline's</I> first anchorwoman was
NBC News' Jessica Savitch. The American Experience was headed
by veteran Moyers' producers from CBS News. National Geographic
specials were simply moved from CBS. Ken Burns' The Civil War
was sponsored by General Motors.
<P>
Sesame Street was produced by the makers of CBS's Captain Kangaroo. British comedies like Monty
Python's Flying Circus were sold profitably to individual stations,
as were howto programs such as This Old House and The French Chef.
Masterpiece Theatre and Mystery! were brought to PBS by the Mobil
Corporation. The story of Milton Friedman's Free to Choose is
a case study of how private sponsorship made possible a major
PBS miniseries. 
<P>
One could choose a different selection of programs
to analyze, but it would be difficult to find truly excellent
PBS fare which did not have some commercial connection. It is
precisely these market forces which serve to improve the range,
quality, and choice of programs on public broadcasting.
<P>
The extent
to which public broadcasting had developed into a large, powerful,
and wealthy establishment over the past three decades remained
largely obscured from public view prior to 1992, when political
deliberation over continued funding for the system began in earnest.
As a result of the subsequent years of debate and disclosure there
is now a bipartisan consensus in Washington that public broadcasting
can be selfsupporting. In 1996 Congressman Jack Fields, chairman
of the House Telecommunications Subcommittee, introduced what
he called the &quot;Public Broadcasting SelfSufficiency Act.&quot;
Although I have opposed such a billiondollar final payment to
the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (as a &quot;trust fund&quot;),
no one has come forward to publicly argue against the principle
of selfreliance.
<P>
Indeed, a January 1996 public opinion survey commissioned
by CPB found broad support among the American public for PBS sales
of videotapes and merchandise, commercials, retail stores, online
computer services, and mailorder catalogs. Fiftyseven percent
of those asked said, &quot;The more sales the better.&quot; Eightysix
percent agreed that &quot;sponsorship announcements are okay because
public broadcasting has to do something to raise money in the
face of the decreased support from the federal government.&quot;
That is, the public now accepts that educational and cultural
programming on PBS can be successfully supported by private revenue
streams.
<P>
A system which began with a $5 million appropriation for
CPB in 1967 has grown over thirty years into a multibillion dollar
worldwide multimedia empire. With over a thousand public radio
and television stations, public broadcasting is now the largest
network in the United States. When judged by the number of stations,
National Public Radio, the Public Broadcasting Service, Pacifica,
and Public Radio International are bigger than Fox, CBS, NBC,
or ABC.
<P>
In addition to their on-air activities, public broadcasters
publish magazines and newsletters; provide computer programs,
online services, sites on the World Wide Web, study guides and
textbooks; host conferences; license toys, games, and clothing;
produce stage shows; sell products through mail order catalogs
and retail stores; and distribute videocassettes and compact disks.
From these activities a large industry has grown to parallel commercial
broadcasting. And, just like other telecommunications giants,
public broadcasting spends millions on public relations firms
and lawyers to lobby Congress.
<P>
The political issue of &quot;zeroing
out&quot; federal subsidies is no longer a matter of &quot;if&quot;
but merely a matter of &quot;when.&quot; For the evidence is clear
and convincing: public broadcasting does not need tax dollars
in order to do its job.

<CENTER><H2>Studies on Religion, Economy Available</H2></CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>
The Media Research Center has produced a new landmark study of how news and 
entertainment television treat religion. Faith in a Box, 1994 builds on the 
1993 study of the same name, which found that religion received poor treatment 
in both the news and on prime time.
In the 1994 study, the MRC found marked improvement in Hollywood's depiction of 
religion, but network news continued to trivialize or downplay religious 
themes.
<P>
As was the case with its 1993 predecessor, Faith in a Box, 1994 was recently 
released to the media in Hollywood and Washington, and distributed to 
conservative and religious activists nationwide.
<P>
Leaders in the entertainment industry, including network executives, have been 
briefed on the MRC's findings as well, and given the MRC's recommendations on 
improving religious portrayals on their television shows.
<P>
To obtain a copy of Faith in a Box, 1994, please call 1-800-MRC-1423 or write 
to us at: Media Research Center, 113 S. West Street, Suite 200, Alexandria, VA 
22314.
<P>
MediaNomics readers still have a chance to obtain Out of Focus: Network 
Television and the American Economy by MediaNomics editor Burton Yale Pines, as 
well.
<P>
Out of Focus takes an in-depth look at an entire year's network reporting on 
such as issues as health care reform, environmental policy, taxes, government 
spending, business, and consumer affairs. The book also looks into the impact 
of prime-time entertainment television on the culture of free enterprise and 
business.
<P>
According to the Richmond Times-Dispatch, "Out of Focus is a major blast at

<CENTER><H2>Letting Government Polluters off the Hook</H2></CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>
For reporters, industry is always the polluter; government is always the 
protector. When it's government programs, such as subsidies for pesticide-using 
farmers, that encourage pollution, reporters are silent.
<P>
Robert Hager's August 8 NBC Nightly News story was a case in point. He began: 
"The purity of the water we drink, the air we breathe, the food we eat. For two 
decades the Environmental Protection Agency has led the clean-up." From 
corporations pouring dioxin into the Great Lakes to protection of wetlands, 
"which prevent flooding and permit wildfowl to breathe." According to Hager, 
House efforts to rein in the EPA would bring "the first big slowdown in 
environmental clean-up since the 1970s."
<P>
But what if the government is the culprit? Take the Everglades. As Jonathan 
Tolman of the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) points out, the U.S. sugar 
program, by subsidizing sugar production, is responsible for much of "the 
increased phosphorus contamination of the Everglades which is disrupting the 
unique nature of the ecosystem." Tolman also lit into the USDA peanut program, 
which not only "costs consumers $500 million a year in higher peanut prices," 
but increases pesticide use by permitting peanuts to be grown in just a handful 
of counties.
<P>
Elimination of farm subsidies has been advocated by environmentalists of all  
political stripes, from the free-market CEI to the liberal Wilderness Society. 
Only reporters are letting government off the hook.

<CENTER><H3>Medicare Reporting Improving, But...</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
In June, MediaNomics described how TV network news reporters were incorrectly 
characterizing Republican plans to slow the rate of Medicare's growth. During 
the study period, reporters called GOP plans "cuts" twice as often as they 
correctly called GOP plans "slowing Medicare's growth."
<P>
Since then, there has been a dramatic improvement in network labeling. Now, 
half of the time network reporters get it right labeling Medicare reform plans. 
Media-Nomics analysts reviewed all of the stories about Medicare on network 
evening newscasts from July 15 to August 15. In the 15 stories, there were 24 
references to either the GOP plan or the Clinton plan to reform Medicare. 
Twelve of the references labeled the plans "cuts" or "reductions." An equal 
number of references labeled the plans as slowing the rate of increase in 
Medicare.
<P>
There is, however, still some confusion. Many reporters now use the terms "cut" 
and "slow the growth" interchangeably, sometimes even in the same story. CNN's 
Catherine Calaway, for instance, on the July 25 World News, referred to 
Medicare "spending cuts," but then, two sentences later, said: "Both parties 
hope to slow Medicare growth, but Republicans would go further."
<P>
Her CNN colleague, Jill Dougherty, did the same four days later. On the July 29 
World News she reported on "Republican plans to cut the growth in Medicare 
spending," but then later in the story alluded to "the $270 billion in 
GOP-proposed cuts." On the next day's World News Dougherty again clouded the 
issue. After first reporting that "Republicans propose cutting Medicare's 
growth by $270 billion," she mentioned charges that "Republican cuts are just a 
cover for the $245 billion they want to give away in tax cuts." 
<P>
Later in the story she said the GOP was "intent on giving voters a balanced 
budget along with hefty tax cuts, and it's hard to see any way to do that 
without taking something out of Medicare."
<P>
The other networks were similarly sloppy. On the July 25 World News Tonight, 
for example, ABC reporter Rebecca Chase pointed out that "both parties propose 
slowing the growth of Medicare spending," but then later talked about how much 
they would "reduce" Medicare spending. At CBS, reporter Bob Orr said: 
"Republicans want to reduce the growth in Medicare spending by $270 billion 
over the next seven years, more the double the $124 billion reduction proposed 
by the White House." But as he was saying this, viewers saw a graphic on screen 
with the same numbers, only under the headline "Proposed Medicare Cuts." 
Viewers presumably must have wondered if Medicare spending was being cut or 
merely slowed.
<P>
The most frequently mentioned number in network Medicare stories was $270 
billion -- the amount by which Republicans propose to slow the projected growth 
of Medicare. It was cited by ABC's Rebecca Chase and Bob Zelnick, CBS's Bob 
Orr, CNN's Jill Dougherty (twice), and NBC's Joe Johns (although Johns called 
it a cut, saying seniors were "angry over Republican plans to reduce Medicare 
spending $270 billion.").
<P>
According to ABC's Zelnick, for example: "Republicans want to cut $270 billion 
from projected cost increases during that time." These reports (except for 
Johns') were true, as far as they went. But they still gave the impression that 
reform meant fewer dollars for Medicare recipients. A clearer way of phrasing 
it would have been: "Republicans would allow the program to grow by $105 
billion over the next seven years instead of the projected $375 billion."
<P>
Only one reporter, CBS's Rita Braver, pointed out that spending per recipient 
would increase over the next seven years under the Republican plan. On the July 
25 CBS Evening News, after running soundbites from Democrat politicians calling 
on Republicans to keep their "greedy" hands off Medicare, Braver put things in 
perspective: "Republicans argue they don't want to cut Medicare, just control 
its growth, spending only $6,700 per capita instead of $8,000 per capita  in 
2002." A graphic on screen clearly showed that spending under the Republican 
plan would increase from $4,800 per recipient to $6,700 per recipient in 2002.
While reporters have improved the accuracy of their Medicare reform labels, 
there are still some of the same weaknesses in Medicare reports that 
MediaNomics identified three months ago. In soundbite selection, for example, 
reporters still overwhelming favor politicians over economists and others who 
could give non-political angles.
<P>
Twenty-five soundbites were from politicians (14 Democrats and 11 Republicans), 
as well as a story-length interview of former Republican Senator Warren Rudman 
by NBC's Brian Williams on the July 27 Nightly News. Only three soundbites, and 
no lengthy interviews, were from economists. And two of those were in one 
story, a July 27 Nightly News report by NBC's Lisa Myers.
<P>
And when it came to the views of ordinary Americans, most reporters seemed to 
agree with NBC's Brian Williams who claimed, on the July 29 Nightly News, that 
the elderly "would be most affected by GOP plans to fix the cost of Medicare." 
There were seven soundbites from elderly Americans who benefit from Medicare. 
There was only one soundbite -- again in Myers' July 27 story -- from someone 
younger who supports today's retirees while knowing they will get less support 
in their old age.
<P>
Only three of the 15 reports, in fact, covered more than the usual political 
angles of Medicare. One was Braver's July 25 CBS Evening News report mentioned 
earlier. She was the only reporter to point out just how much more will be 
spent per recipient under Republican plans. 
<P>
Another was a July 25 World News Tonight story by ABC's Rebecca Chase. She told 
viewers that "Medicare spending has gone from $7 billion [in 1970] to $159 
billion today." She added that "spending, now rising 10 percent a year, must be 
controlled, because in another 15 years the great wave of baby boomers, the 
largest generation ever, will be eligible for Medicare." No other reporter told 
of those numbers.
<P>
The most informative story was Myers' July 27 Nightly News report. She touched 
bases every other reporter missed, such as the fact that the average recipient 
will receive over $100,000 more in benefits than he or she paid in Medicare 
taxes and that the Johnson Administration was almost $100 billion short in its 
projection of what the cost would be in 1990. She also interviewed a Medicare 
expert, rather than just politicians, and a worker whose taxes support 
Medicare, rather than just elderly Medicare recipients.
<P>
But most of the network Medicare reporting, while improving, is still hamstrung 
by a narrow focus on the politics of the issue and an unwillingness to 
distinguish between a cut and slowed growth. If reporters want to help the 
public understand the continually explosive Medicare issue this fall, they will 
focus less on the politics of the issue and more on the numbers behind the 
crisis.

<CENTER><H3>Train Wreck or Fender Bender?</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<P>
Washington is abuzz with talk of an impending budgetary "train wreck." To most 
Americans this conjures up the image of gruesome wreckage and bloody 
casualties. But the truth is that the budget train wreck should have little if 
any impact on the lives of ordinary Americans even if it forces a temporary 
shutdown of the federal government. The only forces that will collide in 
October will be the two competing philosophies of governance of a Democrat 
President and a Republican Congress. Reporters should, therefore, be careful 
about calling the impasse a crisis.
<P>
To be precise, there are actually two potential budget train wrecks ahead. The 
first would occur if President Clinton vetoes any or all of the 13 
congressional appropriations bills. If spending programs have not received an 
appropriation before the start of the fiscal year on  October 1, then no money 
can be spent on the programs. Only "essential" functions, such as defense, law 
enforcement, and air traffic control, would continue to operate.
The second train wreck would occur if President Clinton vetoed the debt 
extension bill. The current debt ceiling of $5 trillion is expected to be 
reached by late October. Mr. Clinton might veto an extension because 
Republicans plan to attach welfare reform, Medicare savings, and tax cuts to 
the debt ceiling. If the ceiling is not raised on time, then the federal 
government is legally prohibited from continuing to borrow. It can continue to 
spend the money that is collected in taxes, but it cannot borrow to send out 
Social Security checks, veterans benefits, payments to defense contractors, and 
so forth.
<P>
How should the press cover this melodrama? Some tips:
<P>
First, a budget train wreck would be neither disastrous nor unprecedented. 
Ronald Reagan closed down the government for a day on several occasions as a 
result of policy disputes with Congress. Then, the circumstances were reversed: 
Reagan vetoed congressional appropriations bills because they spent too much, 
not too little. Moreover, even if the impasse between Congress and the White 
House lasted for several or even many more days, since essential government 
services would continue, only nonurgent federal spending would be halted. 
Surely few would be hurt if Head Start funding or NEA grants were discontinued 
for a few days.
<P>
Second, White House claims that the GOP budget includes deep, mean-spirited 
cuts should be greeted with skepticism. The GOP budget would allow federal 
spending to climb by $350 billion over the next seven years. The President 
wants to spend an extra $600 billion over this same period. Like the dispute 
over school lunch programs earlier this year, the debate is really about how 
much more should be spent on social programs.
<P>
Third, the charge that the GOP plan includes substantial tax cuts for the rich 
lacks factual support. Of the $250 billion tax cut package that will soon be 
agreed to by the House and Senate, the vast majority of the benefits accrue to 
working class Americans with children. The middle-class child tax credit is 
about four times as expensive as the capital gains tax cut. And this child 
credit is very similar to the middle-class tax cut Bill Clinton promised in 
1992. The official Joint Tax Committee finds that the House GOP tax package 
provides the largest percentage reduction in taxes to Americans with incomes 
between $30,000 and $75,000.
<P>
Fourth, the President may not be altogether hostile to the idea of a short-term 
shutdown of the government. During some past shutdowns of the federal 
government, few Americans even noticed. A several-day closure of non-essential 
federal activities may not be the doomsday scenario outside of Washington that 
it is perceived to be inside the beltway. This train wreck may have no 
casualties.
<P>
Fifth, the underlying policy disagreement between the President and Congress is 
whether there should be a balanced budget by 2002. The core dispute between the 
Congress and the President is not over tax cuts, Medicare savings, or welfare 
reform. The fundamental disagreement is whether the nation should be set on a 
course toward a balanced budget.
<P>
The budgetary showdown will, of course, be big news. But reporters should 
refrain from calling a temporary shutdown of the government a crisis when most 
Americans' lives will be changed very little. If reporters cry wolf too often, 
people may stop listening.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<P>
Small, ugly Ferengi represent sci-fi series' vision of business owners
Many observers have noted the exceptional nature of the Star Trek shows. 
According to TV Guide, for instance: "The Star Trek series and films can, in 
theory, foster deeper understanding and better communication among people. But 
do they?" When it comes to race relations, the value of friendship, and the 
virtue of loyalty, the Star Trek shows do. But when it comes to business, 
economics, and the profit motive, they do not.
<P>
The only regular characters on the Star Trek shows who engage in commerce are 
the Ferengi. They are a small, ugly species. They care only about profit and 
seem to think that the best way to earn a profit is to cheat and trick 
customers, even each other. They are disdained by nearly every other species, 
which, it is made clear, have evolved beyond the profit motive.
<P>
The Ferengi have the highest profile role on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine, the 
third incarnation of the Star Trek series. Almost all of the show's non-Ferengi 
regular characters promote virtue and bring honor to their jobs. They lead 
admirable lives. Viewers, last season, saw the stoic Commander Sisko devote his 
life to his son and his crew. They saw Major Kira, a former terrorist, become a 
trusted crew member.
<P>
Odo, a Changeling (one who can change form at will) and the space station's 
head of security, defies his own aggressive species when they threaten his 
friends on the station. Viewers learn that Doctor Bashir chose medicine as a 
profession because it would allow him "to help people." Lieutenant Dax, Sisko's 
confidant, is reliable and wise. And Chief O'Brien puts the happiness of his 
wife, a botanist turned teacher, above his own happiness.
<P>
But then there's Quark, a Ferengi business owner on the space station. Quark 
runs a bar and gambling casino. He puts nothing ahead of profit, except perhaps 
saving his own skin. For instance, on the October 1, 1994 episode, Sisko is 
assigned to establish relations with a relatively unknown species. He wants 
Quark to go along on the dangerous mission because the Ferengi have done 
business with the species. Quark is reluctant and recommends sending his 
brother, Ram, instead. "Ram only has a son to think about. I have a business," 
Quark pleads.
<P>
On the October 15, 1994 episode, a Klingon is accidentally killed in Quark's 
bar. The bar had been doing poorly, but the killing attracts the morbid 
curiosity of onlookers. Quark, to keep their interest, concocts an elaborate 
story about how he killed the Klingon. Business booms, but Ram is worried about 
his brother's ploy. Quark remains steadfast: "Look at that crowd. How long has 
it been since you've seen that many customers waiting to get in here? This is 
an opportunity to turn everything around."
<P>
On the May 20, 1995 episode, Quark visits the Ferengi home planet and viewers 
learn that Ferengi women are not allowed to wear clothes, address men they do 
not know, and, most of all, earn a profit. Quark's mother is accused of all 
three and Quark is held responsible. The clear message: Everything about the 
Ferengi, including the pursuit of profit, is antediluvian. In the same episode, 
one of Quark's relatives decides to join Star Fleet. Quark is livid: "He's a 
disgrace to this family and to Ferengi everywhere. He should be here, helping 
us earn a profit, not in his room learning how to be more like a human."
<P>
On the February 25 episode, the Grand Nagus, who is the leader of the Ferengi 
people, is abducted and brainwashed by aliens. When he returns he seeks to 
reform the Ferengi way of life, to make Ferengi less interested in profit. 
Quark confronts the aliens, who explain their disgust of profit: "We found the 
concept aggressive, adversarial, dangerous. We could not comprehend how any 
species could lead such a barren existence."
<P>
Quark then threatens that if the aliens don't restore the Grand Nagus to his 
former self, more Ferengi would come and bother them. Only then do they agree 
to restore the Nagus. From what viewers see of the Ferengi, who could blame 
them?
<P>
Such depictions of the Ferengi are typical, and there are no positive business 
characters balancing such portrayals. On Star Trek, viewers see people of 
different races, even different species, working together for a common cause 
and putting others ahead of themselves. Unfortunately, business isn't part of 
this vision; rather it's seen as fit only for a small, ugly, less-than-evolved 
subspecies.

<center><h2>Reporters Say American Dream
Stolen</h2>
</center>
<p>
&quot;America: Who Stole the Dream?&quot; was the provocative
title of a recent tenpart Philadelphia Inquirer series, published
nationally in KnightRidder newspapers, by PulitzerPrize winning
journalists Donald L. Barlett and James B. Steele. Their answer
to the series' title question: freemarket proponents and foreigners.
But in their lengthy series they didn't mention some important
facts that critics have since pointed out.
<P>
Free trade was one of
Barlett and Steele's main villains. Instead of creating jobs in
export industries, low American tariffs have &quot;wiped out jobs
and driven down wages.&quot; Barlett and Steele lamented that
in 1996, &quot;the United States will record its 21st consecutive
merchandise trade deficit  a record unmatched by any other developed
country.&quot; America's other big economic problem, according
to Barlett and Steele, is immigration to the U.S. &quot;No other
industrial country has allowed in so many workers in so short
a time, depressing wages and living standards.&quot;
<P>
While these
policies are good for big business in the short term, the two
reporters suggest that American workers may be on the verge of
starting a revolution. They quoted a Kansas factory worker as
saying: &quot;Are we just going to keep lowering our standard
of living? When that happens, nobody is going to have money to
put food on the table. Then you are going to see a revolution,
because people are not going to be able to feed their families.&quot;
A Pennsylvania factory worker told the duo that &quot;there's
going to be bloodshed before we get out of this.&quot; These workers,
Barlett and Steele informed readers, &quot;reflect a largely silent
but growing sentiment&quot; in the U.S. Profiles of people with
such sentiments dominated the series. The two reporters proposed
restricting immigration and hiking tariffs.
<P>
The reaction to the
series was quick and severe. Economics columnist Robert Samuelson
called it &quot;junk journalism&quot; in a September 18 Washington
Post column. &quot;What [the series] doesn't say is that the trade
balance and employment are hardly connected,&quot; he wrote. Samuelson
pointed out that the trade surpluses of Germany, the Netherlands,
and Sweden  which Barlett and Steele envy  haven't kept those
countries from having far higher unemployment rates than the United
States. According to Samuelson, Barlett and Steele reported such
matters &quot;so select ively...that ordinary readers are misled.&quot;
<P>
The reporters' selective use of anecdotes and statistics bothered
George Washington University's Steve Suranovic. In a September
25 letter to the Inquirer, Suranovic wrote that it is easy for
reporters &quot;to choose individuals whose stories confirm their
conclusions.&quot; He argued that Barlett and Steele could have
&quot;found workers with new jobs in export industries earning
higherthanaverage wages&quot; and &quot;profiled  a couple of
millionaires with middleclass backgrounds who created export industries
employing thousands of workers. Bill Gates springs to mind.&quot;
<P>
The Cato Institute's Stuart Anderson argued that Barlett and Steele
misled readers about the economic effects of immigration. In an
October 14 Investor's Business Daily editorial, Anderson pointed
out that having more people in the U.S. does not lead to more
unemployment. The reason: &quot;While immigrants do increase the
supply of labor, they also increase the demand for labor.&quot;
His proof: As immigration and trade deficits have increased over
the past 20 years, and total employment has increased 59 percent,
&quot;the unemployment rate has dropped from 7.7 percent to 5.2
percent.&quot; According to Anderson, &quot;Even the total number
of unemployed people in the country has dropped.&quot;
<P>
The views
of Samuelson, Suranovic, and Anderson are held by enough economists
that they should be discussed in any major, tenpart economic series
that purports to be serious journalism.

<center><h2>Deficit in Trade Reporting</h2>
</center>
<p>
International trade has almost ceased to be an issue to report on for the network
news media. This is in stark contrast to 1991 and 1992, when the
media reported heavily on trade as an electionyear issue. As a
result, the trade deficit  though large  is not nearly the negative
story (except in KnightRidder papers, see page one) for President
Clinton that it was for President Bush. Media Research Center (MRC)
analysts reviewed all of the stories about foreign trade on ABC's
World News Tonight, CBS <I>Evening News</I> and NBC <I>Nightly News</I> between
July 1, 1991 and June 30, 1992. There were 134 trade stories during
this period. MRC analysts also reviewed all of the stories about
foreign trade on the same shows between July 1, 1995 and June
30, 1996. There were only 39 trade stories during this period.
<P>
There was also a large difference in the tone of the stories. During
the 1991-1992 study period, many stories focused on how trade,
especially with Japan, was harming America. Trade was like war.
According to NBC's Garrick Utley, on the January 12, 1992 Nightly
News, there is a &quot;new superpower rivalry. We, of course,
won the old one with the Soviet Union. The outcome of the new
one with Japan is much less certain.&quot; Stories focused on
union demands for tariffs and the views of protectionist economists.
<P>
Reporters adopted a different attitude during the 1995-1996 study period.
Spurred by Pat Buchanan's criticism of free trade, the networks
began pointing out the benefits of a global economy. Before the
South Carolina primary, NBC's Mike Boettcher contrasted the &quot;new
South, flush with foreign investment and hightech jobs&quot; with
&quot;the old South, shuttered textile mills, unemployment, and
pleas for protection from foreign competitors.&quot; ABC's Aaron
Brown reported that &quot;while Buchanan says you can protect
industries with high tariffs without driving out foreign companies
here, economists say that is nonsense.&quot;
<P>
There was also a dramatic change in the amount of coverage given to the trade deficit. In
a 1988 study for the Media Institute, Virginia Commonwealth University's
Ted J. Smith III found that as the American economy improved during
the 1980s, reporting on the economy decreased in volume and became
more negative in tone. In particular, he found that the media
became more interested in one statistic  the trade deficit  when
it widened and less interested in other indicators as they improved.
<P>
The trend in trade reporting that Professor Smith found during the
1980s was present during the 1991-1992 study period, when the U.S.
economy was coming out of recession. There were 21 reports about
the trade deficit, about the same number he found when the economy
was coming out of recession from 1982-1983. But during the 1995-1996
study period, when the economy was fully out of recession and
the trade deficit was expanding, there were only eight such reports.
During the Reagan era, when the economy was fully out of recession,
trade deficit reporting increased dramatically.
<P>
During 1991-1992, even decreases in the trade deficit were treated skeptically.
&quot;Some mixed signs on the U.S. economy today,&quot; reported
ABC's Forest Sawyer, on the March 19, 1992 World News Tonight.
&quot;The U.S. trade deficit grew smaller in January, down $5.8
billion. Still, many economists say they are concerned that American
exports were also down.&quot; 
<P>
Trade deficits, though, have not been big news more recently. In two instances, only CBS mentioned reports of widening trade gaps. On July 18, 1995, Dan Rather announced:
&quot;The United States has taken another beating in world trade,
posting a recordhigh deficit in May.&quot; Nearly two months later,
on September 12, 1995, Rather used almost identical language:
&quot;The U.S. took a beating in the world markets for the second
quarter of the year, posting the biggest quarterly trade deficit
ever.&quot; ABC and NBC ignored the news.
<P>
Trade deficits may not be such bad news. Many economists point out that prosperous countries often run trade deficits because they have a lot of money to spend,
and that imports constitute a great benefit to an economy. So
perhaps ABC and NBC were correct to play down the trade numbers.
Still, this was a new standard not applied to GOP presidents.
<P>
And trade in general could be a bigger news issue in this election
year than it has been. Will Bill Clinton, if reelected, again
defy union backers and work to expand the North American Free
Trade Agreement? Reporters, who seem to have lost interest in
trade, aren't asking.

<Title> Review: Lifetime'sTraders</Title>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<center><h2>New Business Show Better Than Most</h2>
</center>
<p>
This is the battleground of the modern world, where war is waged daily. Fortunes are made
or lost in seconds. These are the men and women of Gardner/Ross.
They're brilliant, ruthless, only as good as their next deal...They
work hard and play harder and agree on just one thing  winning
is everything.&quot;
<p>
From this promo for Traders, a Canadian program
now being shown on cable's Lifetime network, one would think that
it would be another typical TV caricature of business: A world
dominated by rogue greedheads who have no redeeming qualities
and whose work does nothing beneficial for society.
<p>
While this
tendency is present in the show, it doesn't always dominate. Traders
instead treats investment banking the way television usually treats
some other vocations, which is a step above the way business is
normally portrayed. Traders focuses on the Torontobased investment
firm Gardner/Ross. The plots center on the firm's senior executives:
<p>
<blockquote>
Sally Ross -- An idealistic economics professor, Ross steps into her father's
role as senior partner when he is arrested for illegally skimming
$5 million off of a $47 million deal. She is immediately at odds
with the firm's other senior executives, who want to make money
at all costs. She wants to make money, but also wants to preserve
her family firm's good name. When she doesn't allow the firm's
head trader to trade on inside information, he yells: &quot;You
know, you've got a really unhealthy sense of morality.&quot;
<p>
Adam Cunningham -- Ross's alter ego, Cunningham is willing to blackmail
government officials to land a deal. He has no conscience, but
a great knack for cliches: Investment banking is a &quot;zerosum
game. Nobody wins unless somebody loses&quot; and &quot;We all
know the game. You buy on rumor, you sell on fact. Look, if enough
people believe that fertilizer is worth more than gold, the next
thing you know crap is selling at $600 an ounce.&quot; When the
Russian mob threatens the family of the editor of the firm's newsletter,
Cunningham worries that the editor will care more about her family
than the firm.
<p>
Jack Larkin -- A very hungry young trader, he makes
his way to Gardner/Ross by landing a seatofthepants mining deal.
He's willing to risk everything for a big deal, but he's no Cunningham.
He cares deeply about mending his poor relationship with his father,
and his father's illness occupies as much of his time as does
the firm's business. It also gives him some perspective. When
a young trader almost ruins her career by not placing an order
out of concern for a client who is a compulsive gambler, Larkin
tells her: &quot;I'll deny I ever said this, but it's just a job;
it's just money.&quot; By steering the firm into investing in
an emerging medical drug, Larkin shows viewers that investment
banking can help society.
<p>
Marty Stephens -- The firm's head trader,
Stephens is a younger Cunningham. When the firm's building catches
fire, he threatens to fire any trader who leaves the floor. Is
extensive flooding in South Africa bad news? Not for Stephens,
because the firm will make money from the flood's effect on the
markets. His family life is a mess: He doesn't know the name of
his son's girlfriend, even though she eats dinner with the family
every week. When Stephens is suspended for 30 days because of
unethical trades, his life seems to change. He finds a support
group and learns that he is obsessed with money to compensate
for his own insecurities. He resolves to change his ways, but
once he's back on the floor the old Marty returns.
<p>
Suzanna Marks -- Marks runs the firm's investment newsletter. She becomes the
target of the Russian mob, which wants her to recommend a stock
she doesn't want to recommend. She stands on principle, refusing
to compromise her integrity. The Russians then threaten her family,
including her young daughter. Though terribly tempted, she still
doesn't cave. The situation is resolved when Larkin, whom viewers
learn has some mysterious tie to the Russian mob, finds out about
the threats and intervenes. The stress, though, ruins her family
life. Her husband, believing she places too great a priority on
work, files for divorce and custody of their daughter. 
<p>
Traders has often been compared to ER, but it is more like L.A. Law. On
ER, there is no question that the doctors are engaged in noble
work. On L.A. Law, sometimes the lawyers helped people and society;
sometimes they harmed people and society. Some of L.A. Law's lawyers
were extremely unethical, some morally upright. Traders' traders
are a similar mix. For business, as portrayed on television, this
is a step up in the world.

<title>Guest Editorial, by Stephen Gold</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Media
Tweak Tax Facts</h2>
</center>
<p>
Many journalists swarmed like hornets after the
first presidential debate, their stingers aimed at a Bob Dole
soundbite statistic. Maybe the numbers seemed implausible to them.
Maybe they deemed Dole's private source for the statistic less
reliable than comparable government sources. Or, just maybe, they
were simply expressing their kneejerk bias against conservative
economic principles.
<p>
Whatever the reason, the day after the first
debate, several media outlets challenged Dole's Tax Foundation inspired
statement  that the average American household today pays more
in taxes than it does for food, clothing, and housing combined.
<p>
In a frontpage story, for example, the Los Angeles Times hinted at
a Dole blunder. The article related that while Dole relied on
a conservative think tank for his data, &quot;the Bureau of Labor
Statistics' consumer expenditure survey found that the average
household spent more than twice as much on food, clothing and
shelter as on taxes in 1994.&quot; Eric Engberg of CBS News was
more forthright in his analysis. Asserting that &quot;some [of
Dole's] facts got mangled,&quot; Engberg stated the GOP nominee's
claim was an &quot;exaggeration&quot; that could be disproved
by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) study.
<p>
Ironically, while these and other news organizations used the opportunity to show
how Dole, in the words of the Times, was &quot;tweaking&quot;
the truth to his advantage, it appears the media were doing the
same thing. By accepting the BLS data as unimpeachable, the reporters
made an error of such magnitude that, if committed by either of
the presidential candidates, it would have made frontpage news
nationwide.
<p>
The problem is the BLS survey greatly understates taxes
paid. While the national survey is considered an accurate portrayal
of consumer expenditures, in the tax category the report only
covers individual income taxes (federal, state, and local), real
and personal property taxes, and an amorphous category called
&quot;other taxes.&quot;
<p>
Among the most recognizable omissions
from the survey: Social Security taxes paid. While the BLS survey
doesn't have a category for such payments, the Tax Foundation
estimates that the average household will pay about $1,100 for
the employee's share of payroll taxes alone this year. Similarly,
the BLS survey doesn't specifically report sales and excise taxes
paid. In the only entry in the survey in which these taxes might
fit (&quot;other taxes&quot;), households earning between $50,000
and $69,000 are said to pay $77 annually. By comparison, based
on Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) data, the Tax Foundation
estimates that households in that income group average over $2,000
in federal, state, and local sales and excise taxes paid.
<p>
Also,
the BLS survey results altogether ignore the effect of indirect
levies, such as business taxes, on American society. Unlike the
survey, the Tax Foundation incorporates all taxes at all levels
of government in its annual analysis, including those levies hidden
from taxpayers. For example, business taxes (including corporate
income taxes) must be borne by the general population somehow,
whether through lower wages for workers, lower shareholder dividends
(which harms anyone with a pension fund), or higher consumer prices.
So, while the typical American won't ever see a tax bill for these
taxes, they're certainly paid by everyone.
<p>
In total, the BLS survey
 relied on by so many reporters to knock Bob Dole's argument for
lower taxes  understates total taxes paid by more than four times,
according to the Tax Foundation's analysis based on BEA data.
<p>
The
flaw here isn't the BLS survey. It lies in the way the survey's
results were used by reporters. The search for truth by the media
is undeniably critical, especially during an election year. Unfortunately,
the public is hurt when reporters, to prove a point, choose to
accept certain economic premises without verifying their legitimacy.

<title>Reporters Ignore Education Inflation</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Reporters Ignore Education Inflation</center></h2>
<p>
With Congress trying to scale back the Clinton Administration's direct lending program for college students, the media have focused on partisan bickering over the issue. This has obscured the larger question: Why are tuitions rising so fast in the first place?
<p>
On the September 10 World News Tonight ABC's Michele Norris said, "The battle over federal funding for education is turning into an all-out political war. Republican lawmakers are proposing deep cuts in education. President Clinton has said that one of his top priorities is not only maintaining but increasing education spending, particularly for needy college students."
<p>
This politics-centered coverage continued with Rita Braver's report on the September 11 CBS Evening News: "President Clinton took his education crusade to Southern Illinois....He told college students that Republicans in Congress are trying to cut their financial assistance." Braver's story, like Norris's, was relatively balanced; Braver noted "Republicans suggest the President is perpetrating a big lie on campus, engaging in scare tactics to make families believe that student aid is in jeopardy." 
<p>
But neither report took the opportunity to discuss why college costs have risen and how growing federal education spending may be the culprit. Heritage Foundation scholar John Hood points this out in the May issue of Reason: "College administrators, waxing sympathetic, beg for more aid from Congress and state legislatures. Interestingly, those same administrators, along with policy makers and the media, rarely try to explain why college costs are rising." 
<p>
Hood points out that average tuitions rose by a third between 1984 and 1994 because "governments, both federal and state, subsidize colleges and universities -- even private ones -- so heavily that tuition and fees have only the murkiest relationship to the costs of providing higher education."
<p>
Hood shows that the recent rise in federal spending on higher education closely corresponds with the hike in tuition: "During the 1970s, the real-dollar value of government assistance to higher education, adjusted for the number of full-time students, fell slightly. So did real tuition, room, and board charges for both public and private colleges."
<p>
"Throughout the 1980s, however, government assistance per full-time student rose significantly (10 percent, not including loans), accompanied by a 27 percent real rise in public college charges and a staggering 50 percent real rise in private college charges. College and University revenue from Pell Grants rose by more than 25 percent from 1985-86 to 1991-92; revenue from state-level need-based grants rose by about 15 percent."
<p>
If prices in private industry ever rose so fast, reporters would be quick to ask why. They should hold educators to the same standard.

<title>Easy on the Earned Income Tax Credit</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>Easy on the Earned Income Tax Credit</h2><center>

The October 2 Newsweek hailed the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) as a boon to 
the working poor and called Congressional efforts to cut the program "the war 
on work." But Newsweek didn't tell readers about evidence that the EITC 
actually discourages work by creating a huge marginal tax rate on the poor.
<p>
According to Newsweek's Marc Levinson, the program, which provides a tax credit 
to low-income workers and cash to those who don't pay taxes, "hits the 
bulls-eye, aiding families who earn too much for welfare but too little to have 
a tax-favored mortgage." Levinson quoted EITC beneficiary Janene Moore as 
saying: "My kids are not welfare statistics....They can say that their momma 
gets a check all right, but it's from her job, seven hours a day, 35 hours a 
week." Levinson also argued that the EITC "does nothing to discourage marriage" 
and cited fraud as the only argument against cutting the credit.
<p>
But what if the EITC actually discourages work? According to the September 20 
Investor's Business Daily (IBD), "Most economists agree that today it's doing 
more harm than good." According to IBD: "Once the family reaches that limit 
[$11,600], the credit is phased out. For each dollar over $11,600, the family 
loses 21 cents of its EITC until its income hits $28,000. Economists say this 
acts like a marginal tax rate of 21 percent," which "provides a strong 
disincentive to work."
<p>
IBD also cited American Enterprise Institute economist Marvin Kosters who 
points out that even having an EITC may discourage work. "After all, 
[recipients] get a 40 percent raise without working any harder." Kosters also 
claims that the EITC does indeed exact a marriage penalty, in some cases as 
much as $5,000 per couple. According to Kosters, That "would be about 25 
percent of the combined income of the married couple."
<p>
It's not enough for reporters to cite fraud as an argument against the EITC. 
Economists have serious concerns about the program's disincentives to work, 
concerns which must be addressed in a balanced story.

<title>Inequality Study Left Unchallenged by MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>

<center><h2>Inequality Study Left Unchallenged by MacNeil-Lehrer 
NewsHour</center></h2>
Something unusual happened on September 28. The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour, 
normally well known for balanced and fair coverage, gave a one-sided account of 
an important issue. David Gergen, now returned from his role as White House 
adviser, conducted a softball interview of economist Edward Wolff about wealth 
inequality which ignored many flaws in Wolff's analysis.
<p>
Gergen didn't challenge Wolff, author of a recent study on the subject for the 
20th Century Fund, when he claimed that "income of the average family has been 
basically stagnant for the last fifteen, twenty years, and has actually started 
to decline during the 1990s." Wolff said he saw "nothing that suggests that 
these forces are going to abate." Moreover, he blamed the stock market as 
"another factor which has caused wealth and inequality to rise."
<p>
Gergen could have asked Wolff to respond to critics of his study. Christopher 
Farrell reports in the October 9 Business Week what many economists have long 
maintained: "The consumer price index has been overstating inflation by at 
least a percentage point. If that's the case, then real wage gains are 0.8 
percent a year," rather than the 0.2 percent decline reported by government 
statistics. Farrell also reports that "the skill level of American labor is 
improving, with more workers getting the education and training employers 
require" and that in the past, that has produced more equal income 
distribution.
<p>
The August 22 Investor's Business Daily (IBD), meanwhile, points out a major 
flaw in Wolff's study. "Pensions account for about one-third of the average 
household's assets," the newspaper reports, and are "the way most Americans are 
invested in the stock market." But Wolff's study, according to IBD, excludes 
the value of pension plans. (See page 5.)
<p>
Instead of pushing his guest to answer these criticisms, Gergen asked softball 
questions like, "I take it from the tenor of your remarks, as well as your 
study, that you think this growing inequality as you found it is dangerous 
socially for the country?" Viewers have come to expect more from the 
MacNeil/Lehrer News-Hour.

<title>Missing Japan's Revolutionary Debate</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>

<center><h2>Missing Japan's Revolutionary Debate</h2></center>

Network news coverage of Japan has changed recently. When Japan seemed 
invincible, network journalists would often report on Japanese industrial 
policy with the underlying premise that it made Japanese capitalism superior to 
American capitalism. Now, with Japan's economy in a prolonged tailspin, the 
networks have dropped the subject, no longer showing any interest in the 
economic effects of Japanese industrial policy.
<p>
Ned Potter's December 15, 1992 ode to Japan's government planners for ABC's 
World News Tonight was typical of a pre-1995 network story on Japan. Potter 
told viewers that environmental protection would be the biggest new industry of 
the future. He said that while the U.S. was leading the world in environmental 
cleanup technology, "Japan is mounting a major offensive to be the new leaders 
in what they call the eco-industrial revolution."
<p>
Potter glowingly described "Genesis," the Japanese plan to direct companies to 
work on such projects as technology for clean coal and oil plants. The moral of 
Potter's story: Genesis "shows how far ahead the Japanese are looking. And 
that's the challenge for America. With the new Administration seeking an 
economic revival, how can it best help U.S. industry compete with Japan for the 
environmental marketplace?"
<p>
That was 1992. Reporters, understandably, no longer use Japan as a model of 
government economic planning. But they also aren't talking about Japanese 
industrial policy at all anymore, even though in Japan, the role of government 
is the subject of fierce debate. U.S. News & World Report's Stephen Butler 
relates that "a fast-selling, controversial new book that has unleashed a 
torrent of debate in Tokyo suggests Japan must do more than throw money at its 
problems."
<p>
According to Butler, Japanese author Yukio Noguchi argues that Japan's economic 
woes "are a painful legacy of World War II, when the government intervened 
heavily in the private economy and suppressed market forces to boost industrial 
output." But despite this "torrent of debate" about Noguchi's book, no network 
report from Japan has mentioned Noguchi or his free market arguments.
Network reporters should be more curious about the roots of Japan's four-year 
economic stagnation. If they are, they will find and report on a robust debate 
in Japan about the role of government in a free economy.

<center><h3>Post: Low Pay Not a Dead End </h3></center>

A nation of hamburger flippers in dead-end jobs.
<p>
That's almost always the dire outcome predicted by journalists when they cover 
America's fast-food industry. Such reporting, intended or not, tends to confirm 
and bolster the calls by politicians and academics for ambitious federal 
job-training programs and other measures that they claim are needed to lift 
unskilled Americans out of the minimum-wage trough.
<p>
Such reporting, sadly, misses one of America's major economics and business 
stories: The fast-food industry as the nation's most effective job-training 
program. 
<p>
One reporter, however, obviously has not missed the story. He's the Washington 
Post's Peter Behr who, in a September 11 page one article, profiles Le-Van 
Hawkins, a 35-year-old African-American Horatio Alger who now owns a $39 
million-a year business and who got his start where? At hamburger-flipping 
McDonald's. Throughout his perceptive report, Behr uses Hawkins' own successes 
to make the valid but almost always ignored point that fast-food jobs can be a 
great career beginning rather than a dead end.
<p> 
Behr explains how Hawkins, a high school dropout who had "a serious cocaine 
habit" and grew up in Chicago's notorious Cabrini Green housing project, was 
taught discipline and skills by his fast-food employers. At his first 
McDonald's job, writes Behr, Hawkins "became a walking encyclopedia on 
McDonald's procedures for dealing with burgers, pickles and fries. The lesson 
of getting the details right struck." These lessons were reinforced by 
subsequent jobs at Kentucky Fried Chicken and other fast-food outlets.
<p>
Citing an executive with Hawkins' firm, Behr tells his readers that there is "a 
career ladder inside the fast-food world, even if the bottom rungs don't reach 
very high. Workers who start out preparing food can advance to production 
leader, hourly shift manager and assistant manager." Some of the Hawkins' store 
managers, reports Behr, "earn up to $50,000 annually and will have the option 
to buy stock in the company."
<p>
Behr too notes the broader economic implications of the fast-food industry. He 
writes: "Fast-food franchises have long been islands of commerce in the often 
depressed sections of major cities." These typically inner-city franchises, 
says Behr, then "provide business for attorneys, accountants and suppliers in 
the community."
<p>
Behr's report is a needed antidote to journalists' prevailing low-view of 
low-paying jobs. Characteristic of this is Time's John Greenwald in the 
magazine's November 14, 1994 edition. Writing about high-salaried computer 
jobs, Greenwald remarked that they "bear little resemblance to the low-paying 
gas-pumping and fast food-making positions that the word 'services' has often 
brought to mind." This echoed Beth Belton's USA Today article of February 15, 
1994, talking about "low-paying jobs with few opportunities for advancement." 
TV viewers, meanwhile, would have heard ABC's Bob Jamieson, on the March 15, 
1994 World News Tonight, refer derisively to what he called "the low-paying 
service sector."
<p>
These and other journalists should study closely Behr's article. They then 
should investigate how poorly-educated Americans actually can learn job skills 
and work discipline. Their resulting articles could address the questions: What 
trains more workers -- government programs or fast food employers? Who does a 
better job of training? How long do most fast-food workers actually remain at 
the lowest-paying level? Such articles, at last, would begin educating the 
public that hamburger-flipping seldom is a dead-end job.

<title>&quot;MEDIA REALITY CHECK '96&quot;</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<blockquote>
<center><img src="/mrc/images/checkbox.gif" <br>
<p></center>

A WORD FROM L. BRENT BOZELL III<br>
CHAIRMAN, MEDIA RESEARCH CENTER<br>
JUNE 1996<p>

CBS reporter Bernard Goldberg said it best: &quot;The old argument that the networks and other 'media elites' have a liberal bias is so blatantly true it's hardly worth discussing any more.&quot; From Walter Cronkite to Newsweek Washington Bureau Chief Evan Thomas, more and more media personalities are admitting the liberal bias they denied for so long, while ridiculing conservatives who raised that charge. 
<p>
The recent Freedom Forum poll of Washington reporters and editors found 89 percent of them voted for Bill Clinton in 1992, to only seven percent for Bush; 61 percent identified themselves as liberal or moderate-to-liberal, to only nine percent who were conservative or moderate-to conservative; 59 percent called the Contract with America &quot;an election-year campaign ploy,&quot; to only three percent who thought it was
&quot;a serious policy proposal.&quot; 
<p>
And their coverage of public policy and politics reflected these views. We are not here today to prove a blatantly obvious anti-conservative bias in the press. We have proven that for almost a decade. We are here to demand an end to the non-stop media onslaught against the conservative movement -- against our ideas, our character, and our leaders. We are here to demand the media be fair and balanced -- for once. 
<p>
To this end, I announce &quot;Media Reality Check '96,&quot; a 2.8 million dollar campaign by the Media Research Center to expose for the American electorate the
blatant left-wing agenda that has made a mockery of the term &quot;objective journalism.&quot; The message from the conservative movement, like the line from the movie &quot;Network,&quot; is loud and clear: &quot;We're mad as hell and we're not going to take it any more.&quot; 
<p>
&quot;Media Reality Check '96&quot; will combine the most sophisticated media research operation with the most advanced technology to produce what we believe the most comprehensive and creative national campaign ever waged to confront, expose, and neutralize the liberal bias that dominates the news media today. 
<p>
Knowing how so many establishment media outlets feel it is their right to examine everything and everyone under the sun, while refusing to allow any criticism of themselves, this year we are bypassing the establishment media and going straight to the voters through the fledgling conservative media. And based on the test-marketing of this campaign over the past month, I can confidently state that our message will reach,
on average, at least 50,000 conservative activists and 25 million voters every week. As well, all of our findings will be made available to thousands of journalists on a regular basis to let them know their days of journalistic political activism are over.
<p>
&quot;Media Reality Check '96&quot; will have nine major components: <br>
<ol>
<li>Research. The basis of all our products is research by our eight-member media analysis team, who are taping and analyzing every single network newscast, national
newspaper and news magazine to document trends of liberal bias. Our comprehensive network news tracking system will not only document bias in 1996, but show, with scientific data, just how this follows the pro-Clinton, anti-conservative coverage in 1992.

<li>Publications. All of the MRC's monthly and bi-weekly publications -- MediaWatch, MediaNomics, Notable Quotables, and Flash -- will focus almost exclusively on the issues and trends of campaign '96 for thousands of reporters, subscribers, and activists.

<li>Pattern of Deception. MRC Senior Analyst Tim Graham's new book documents the astonishing bias Bill Clinton has benefited from in the last four years and sets the stage for a national discussion of the media's obvious preference for this President. In less than six weeks, he has conducted interviews or had his blockbuster book cited on over 50 radio shows, from local shows to nationally syndicated programs like the G. Gordon
Liddy show, the Ollie North show, and Rush Limbaugh. 

<li>Talk Radio. Over the past several months we have established an informal network of over 100 radio talk shows -- including every major nationally-syndicated show -- to provide them with up-to-the-minute evidence of left-wing bias in the establishment press masquerading as &quot;objective news.&quot; As well, MRC spokesmen are now conducting daily interviews on numerous shows coast to coast to expose the liberal media.

<li>The Internet. Using the Internet, the MRC will be communicating with hundreds of thousands of conservative activists while providing immediate intelligence to the conservative media. The MRC website will be up and running on June 24 for public
and media use during the 1996 campaign, with a full slate of studies, profiles, and special reports. MRC Executive Director Brent Baker is providing &quot;Reality Check Cyber Alerts&quot; through e-mail to the nation's most influential opinion leaders three to five
nights a week for a rapid response to media bias.

<li>Media Outreach. Two-page &quot;Media Reality Check '96&quot; rebuttals are being sent via &quot;blast fax&quot; to over 1500 media and political contacts across the country on a regular basis. In addition, bias during major campaign events -- such as the upcoming conventions -- will be addressed with news releases and news conferences throughout the year.

<li>Conventions. Once again this year, the MRC will publish a daily newsletter during the two party conventions to document the ongoing political slant in prime-time convention
coverage. This year, the MRC is also considering a daily national radio feed to provide evidence of reporters' biased coverage. This daily commentary will reach tens of millions of voters.

<li>Conservative Grass-Roots Activism. To make the so-called objective national media an issue in this campaign, the MRC is mass-producing thousands of bumper stickers,
pens, refrigerator magnets and other novelty items with the tag line &quot;I Don't Believe the Liberal News Media.&quot; The national distribution efforts are already under way. MRC members -- 75,000 nationwide -- will also participate through letter-writing  campaigns and other efforts to expose and confront liberal bias at the local level.

<li>Paid Advertising. The MRC will be advancing its efforts through a paid advertising campaign. Conservative newspapers, magazines, and radio talk shows will be the vehicle of choice for our paid advertising efforts; again, based on the test-marketing of this communications strategy, we are confident it will have a huge impact.
</ol>
Will the national media try again to tilt the election in favor of Bill Clinton? Will they try again consistently to label the Republicans as &quot;extremists&quot; -- or worse -- and the Democrats as moderates, even conservatives?<br>
Will they regularly denounce Republican ads as &quot;wrong&quot; when they were proven right, while ignoring Clinton ads altogether?<br>
Will they try again to single out the Republicans as mudslinging campaigners while presenting the Democrats as a hopeful force for positive change? If so, the MRC will be there to show America just how distorted the message really is. 
<p>
By no means do we suggest that all reporters in the national press are culpable. Many have distinguished themselves, and continue to distinguish themselves with their dedication to balance and fairness. And that's all we conservative ask. But this year we demand it.

<img src="/mrc/images/pattern.gif" align="right">The explosive new book <i><b>Pattern of Deception</b></i> assembles a mountain of evidence proving how the liberal media, especially the television networks, have promoted the Clinton agenda, both during his campaign and his presidency.<p>

You'll learn:

<ul>
<li> Which TV producer bragged about setting up Clinton's campaign public relations while working for ABC.

<li> How the media campaigned to discredit Gennifer Flowers, Paula Jones, and Troopergate.

<li> How Clinton lied about being drafted -- and how the networks virtually spiked it.

<li> Which <i>Time</i> editor misled readers about Clinton being drafted -- and eventually landed the # 2 job in the State Department.

<li> Which <i>Washington Post</i> reporter compared Clinton to Jesus Christ.
</ul>

"In <i><b>Pattern of Deception</b></i>, you'll read how the press have given the Clinton administration a free ride on policy issues which are far more important to the future of liberalism than personal peccadilloes."<br>
-- Cal Thomas<p>

"The liberal media have the power to set the national agenda, and <i><b>Pattern of Deception</b></i> proves that this is just what they're doing."<br>

<h2><center>Quote of the Day</h2><p>
  
    <i>"I think there were some transcendent moments but some risky
rhetorical gambles here, where Bob Dole may have taken the
risk of coming across more as the preachy grandfather than
the grown-up he most wants to be, and that could turn off
some voters." <p>

-- ABC s Michel McQueen just after Dole's
acceptance speech last night.<p></i>
  
<h2><a name="speech">Dole's Speech</a> Performance Praised by Most, But... 
ABC: Dole s "A Preachy Grandfather"</h2></center>
  
    Bob Dole speech coverage featured praise for his delivery,
but the networks were critical of its content. <p>
  
    -- ABC condemned it as "preachy," and NBC called it "tough."
Just after Dole finished, ABC's Michel McQueen warned that he
may have come across as a "preachy grandfather" [see Quote of
the Day below]. Sam Donaldson called it "a red meat speech"
and a "a very tough speech, I mean, Bob Dole says that
violent criminals will have their lives made a living Hell,
he'd pursue terrorists to the ends of the Earth, I think he s
going to dash the teachers  unions into the sea." NBC's Lisa
Myers described it as "the best speech I ever saw Bob Dole
give," but colleague David Bloom said "this was a very tough
speech, Bob Dole calling himself combative for country, but
the people down here, the partisans loved it."<p>
  
    -- CNN went to Wolf Blitzer for a Democratic response just
four minutes after Dole finished. Gene Randall then demanded
Dole campaign manager Scott Reed respond to that spin: "Let
me just run by first what George Stephanopoulos said about
the speech. Even before it was over he called it, 'The most
negative, partisan, divisive acceptance speech since
Goldwater in 1964.'"<p>
  
    -- In Dole's speech CNN's Bernard Shaw discovered the
beginning of a nasty campaign: "I ve maintained that this
campaign is going to be one of the nastiest, bare-knuckled,
direct to the gut campaign's in America s political history.
Listen to this one sentence, quote 'It is demeaning to the
nation that within the Clinton administration a core of the
elite never grew up, never did anything real, never
sacrificed, never suffered and never learned, should have the
power to fund with your earnings their dubious and self-serving
schemes.'"<p>  
    -- One day after Ted Koppel left San Diego, Nightline covers
the convention, talking with a focus group; reporters discuss
GOP inclusiveness.<p>
  
    -- A Video Contrast: In 1992 ABC and CBS ran bios of Clinton;
but nothing for Dole this year. NBC ran part of Clinton's
video, but none of Dole's. <p>
  

<h2><center><a name="diversity">So Much for Network Bio Diversity
The Man from Hope vs. Russell's Own</a></h2></center><p>

    Four years ago at the Democratic convention in New York, ABC's 
Peter Jennings explained the quandary biographical films present
to the networks. "I'm not precisely sure what to call it," 
Jennings said, "but it's the Democratic Party's film 
about Bill Clinton's life, and it's something we try to 
come to grips with every four years when the party decides what
its view of the candidates is." ABC's 1992 resolution: "We 
think it's usually more prudent to give the assignment to a
reporter." Reporter Jeff Greenfield then introduced viewers to
Bill Clinton's life story.<p>

    CBS did the same. Dan Rather told viewers: "The delegates are 
now watching a film about Bill Clinton, prepared by the Clinton
campaign. We asked correspondent Richard Threlkeld to look at the
film and report on it." NBC aired the final three minutes of the
"Man from Hope" film. This year, CBS only showed the last 30
seconds of the Republicans biographical film for Dole and didn't
assign the story to a reporter. NBC aired nothing. ABC skipped
the film so it could check in with Brit Hume with President
Clinton in Wyoming, with the vital news that Clinton claimed he
wasn't watching the convention.<p>

    Bob Dole's life story would still be news to many Americans. 
<i>U.S. News & World Report's</i> Gloria Borger noted in the 
June 3 issue that "A Harris poll last month found that 59 percent
of Americans don't know Dole has a disibility." They must watch
too much television news.<p>


<h2><center><a name="CBS">Paula Zahn Insists CBS Coverage Has "Been Abundantly Fair"
But CBS Impugned GOP as "Extremist"</a></h2></center><p>
  
    Wednesday night Marc Morano, best known as the Rush Limbaugh
TV show's "man in Washington," confronted several network
reporters with his camera and microphone. Asked about liberal
bias, CBS correspondent Paula Zahn responded:<p>
  
    "Those of us who work for organizations like CBS News take
great pride in being fair and I think if you look at this
Republican convention, our coverage, you ll agree that we
have been abundantly fair." Well, Morano asked, what about
the use of extremist labels? "I don t think I ve used the
word extremist once since I got here on Saturday," the former
CBS This Morning co-host insisted. "Obviously, labels, I
think are very limiting and we have to be very careful about
how we use that."<p>
  
    She may be able to restrain herself, but her colleagues are
not so professional. On Monday's CBS Evening News Dan
Rather asked Jack Kemp: "Even some Republicans describe the
current platform as quote, 'harsh, extreme,' even 'radical.' 
Do you see it that way?"  <p>
  
    Lesley Stahl, later that night in prime time, claimed: "The
whole purpose of tonight's convention, the whole program, is
to diminish the image of this party as extreme, because
that's what's turning the women off. Four years ago, the main
speaker at the convention...was Pat Buchanan. He was yelling,
his pitchforks were raised. Tonight it will be Colin Powell,
he will appeal to civility. On the platform, women find that
extreme. It's turning them off." <p>
  
    But Zahn is far from innocent. Take a look at a question that
she posed on the July 5, 1995 CBS This Morning to Pat
Buchanan: "Even your sister concedes, although some
supporters might like what you have to say about the economy
and these very specific issues you just mentioned, they re
very turned off by some of your social policies. And you know
you ve got political enemies out there calling you an
isolationist, a bigot, you re anti-gay, and some even go as
far as saying that your social stands are reminiscent of Nazi
Germany. How are you to win them over?"<p>


<center><h2><a name="week">What TV Showed: Extremist, Intolerant & Strident Republicans
The Distorted Week in Review<a/></center><p></h2>
  
    So what have viewers across America heard about the
Republican convention? At week s end, here s a collection of
the most biased quotes from the networks:<p>
  
    -- "He [Kemp] is a rare combination 'a nice conservative.
These days conservatives are supposed to be mean. They're
supposed to be haters.'" <p>
<i>-- CNN analyst Bill Schneider, August
9 Inside Politics.</i><p>
  
    -- "Ronald Reagan will still have to learn how history will
judge his time in office -- the deficits, the Iran-Contra
affair. But for the members of this party, there is no more
beloved figure." <p>

<i>-- Tom Brokaw just after Nancy Reagan's
emotional thank-you following a video tribute to Ronald
Reagan, August 12 NBC convention coverage.<p></i>
  
    -- "You know a lot has been made of the Republican Party
being a very inclusive party, one that can embrace the views
of various people. Given the way the platform has worked out
vis-a-vis abortion, and the fact that some of these
Republican governors are not speaking because they felt as if
they were being censored. Do you still believe you can call
the Republican Party an inclusive party?" <p>
<i>-- One of seven
abortion questions posed by NBC's Katie Couric to Senator Kay
Bailey Hutchison, August 12 Today.</i><p>
  
   -- "Women have not responded well to a message that at times
has been considered too harsh, too mean." <p>
<i>-- ABC's Michel
McQueen, during August 13 coverage.<p></i>
  
    -- "It was grand TV, well-scripted, well-staged, craftily
designed for a broadcast image of tolerance and diversity
that's starkly at odds with reality." <p>
<i>-- ABC's Jim Wooten on
Colin Powell s address, August 13 World News Tonight.</i><p>
  
    -- "The right to abortion has never been an overwhelming
issue for women at election time. But this fight within the
Republican Party has many women questioning how far this
party will go to limit their rights."  <p>
<i>-- ABC s Peter Jennings,
August 13.</i><p>
  
    -- "Although his speech was generally well-received, the
reception was restrained, and there were boos whenever Powell
steered away from the right. Though they booed and also
heckled dissent, Republicans claimed the mantle of inclusion
throughout the first night of their convention. We can expect
more of the same today, Tuesday, August 13, 1996." -- <p>
<i>Today
co-host Bryant Gumbel.</i><p>
  
    -- "Do you think -- this is a party that is dominated by men
and this convention is dominated by men as well...Do you
think before tonight they thought very much what happens in
America with rape?" <p>
<i>-- Tom Brokaw to rape victim Jan Licence
who had just addressed the convention, August 13.  </i><p>
  
    -- "I think the speech by Senator Hutchison of Texas is
dangerous, Tom, because she uses words that could be
interpreted by some people as mean." <p>
<i>-- NBC's Tim Russert
previewing Hutchison's August 13 speech.</i><p>
  
    -- "Polls will tell you these days that people do not want
much partisanship in their politics, but they got it at the
Republican convention last night. There were attacks on
President Clinton's credibility, integrity, even his eating
habits." <p>
<i>-- ABC Good Morning America co-host Charles Gibson,
August 14. </i><p>
  
    -- "There's an old adage that says what you do speaks so
loudly I can't hear what you say. Republicans are speaking
tolerance and diversity. Are you seeing any evidence of it,
or quite the contrary?" <p>
<i>-- Gumbel to Tim Russert, August 14
Today.</i><p>
  
    -- "Just how tightly scripted is this convention? Well, a
Russian television reporter said today that this is as
tightly controlled as anything the Communist Party ever put
on, Tom." <p>
<i>-- NBC reporter David Bloom, August 14 Nightly News.</i><p>

<h3>Bryant the Killjoy</h3><p>
  
    As the rest of the media conceded the success of Elizabeth
Dole's Wednesday night speech from the floor, Today co-host
Bryant Gumbel grumbled Thursday morning: "Yeah, I guess some
would say it was cool. Others would say it was calculating,
huh?" <p>
  
    Later, Gumbel added: "In keeping with the softer image that
Republicans are trying hard to project at their convention,
Elizabeth Dole last night did her impression of Oprah
Winfrey, and in a fashion that supporters would call
heartfelt but others would call hokey, Liddy Dole sang her
husband s praises to the delegates." <p>
  
  
<h3>Ending With a Bang</h3><p>
  
    ABC's Brian Ross filed stories all week long on the corporate
money lavished on the GOP, but his Thursday World News
Tonight report focused on a surprising target: "Very much in
the middle of the mix are the giant media corporations, like
CNN, whose multi-million-dollar merger has yet to be formally
approved by federal regulators. Time Warner gave more than
$100,000 to be an official sponsor of the convention."<p>
  
    Former <i>Los Angeles Times</i> reporter Dwight Morris told Ross
media companies shouldn t use the conventions to lobby, and
Ross noted: "But that didn t stop CBS lobbyists from giving
the Republicans thousands of dollars to help pay for the cost
of food and liquor in the skybox belonging to Republican
Party Chairman Haley Barbour." <p>
  
    Ross even reported on his own bosses: "Last night, the ABC
hospitality suite was a lobbyist s dream. With visits from
Congressman Tom Bliley, the chairman of the House Commerce
Committee, which handles telecommunications issues. And then
from the #2  man in the House, Majority Leader Dick Armey,
who could be seen with top ABC executives, including the ABC
lobbyist, who insisted he wasn't lobbying." We look forward
to an equally revealing set of nightly reports from Chicago.<p>
  
  
<h3>William's Wimps</h3><p>
  
    <i>Wall Street Journal</i> reporter Bob Davis wrote an article for
the Thursday morning edition on MRC Chairman Brent Bozell and
the Media Reality Check '96 effort in San Diego. Davis found
notable hostility at CNN to Bozell: "His criticism is mostly
background noise,  says CNN political director Tom Hannon."
Davis asked CNN analyst Bill Schneider to explain his claim
last weekend that "conservatives are supposed to be haters"
and Jack Kemp "is a rare combination: a nice conservative."
Said Schneider: "I wasn t name-calling. I was making an
analytical point." He added that he calls liberals wimps, but
"they re so wimpy, they don t complain. When you talk about
mean conservatives, the wrath of God comes down on you."<p>
  
    But a look into the Nexis news data retrieval system finds
something different. Schneider quoted criticism of Colin
Powell s "wimpout" on abortion in 1995. The only other uses
of "wimp" in the last five years were three nearly identical
references in 1992 and 1994 to the 1988 Bush-Dukakis
campaign. Schneider declared on November 1, 1994: "Michael
Dukakis got beaten up by the wimp, which proved he wasn't
tough enough for the job."<p>

<h2>On the Bright Side, from the January 1996 MediaWatch</h2>
<p>
<h3>Nightline's True Story</h3>
<p>
ABC News has never been eager to report the truth on GOP efforts to reform Medicare. Good Morning America anchor Morton Dean continually got the story wrong. On October 12 Dean relayed the Democratic line: "The Republican plan would cut $270 billion in Medicare spending over seven years." Exactly two months and scores of inaccurate reports later, ABC finally told the truth with a December 12 Nightline dedicated to exposing President Clinton's demagoguery.
<p>
Chris Bury explained the game, "`Devastate, destroy, dismantle` -- strong words, but in reviewing Mr. Clinton's performance on Medicare, Republicans have another word in mind: deceptive...The truth is, both President Clinton and the Congress want to spend more money, not less, on Medicare."
<p>
Reviewing Hillary Clinton's 1993 appearance before Congress, Bury showed the First Lady's testimony where she proclaimed that her health plan reduced "the rate of growth in Medicare from about 11 percent increase annually to about a 6 or 7 percent increase annually." Then Bury added, "But this year, when Republicans proposed to slow the annual growth of Medicare spending to 7.2 percent...President Clinton accused them of gutting the program."
<p>
Bury concluded his report: "Since August, when President Clinton cast himself in the role of Medicare's protector, his own standing in the polls has risen steadily, and though his performance has been a smashing popular success, many critics believe the price of admission has cost the country an honest debate."
<p>


<h3>A Woman on Welfare</h3>
<p>
When Republicans began to tinker with the welfare system, reporters were quick to point out the millions who would end up in poverty as a result. But on the November 19 60 Minutes, CBS' Lesley Stahl offered a different take when she profiled "a woman who knows as much about the subject as anyone. A woman on welfare? No, a woman on the subject of welfare."
<p>
She was Eloise Anderson, head of California's welfare division. Anderson knows what welfare is like; she was once on it. She  also supports Republican proposals. Stahl noted: "What Anderson wants to get rid of are the cash payments that go directly to welfare recipients, known as AFDC....It seems there's no argument for AFDC that she agrees with. The problem, she says, starts with the way welfare marginalizes men, because no poor man who makes the minimum wage, can compete with it."
<p>
Stahl pointed out: "Her critics have called her everything from mean-spirited to compassionless, but Anderson says it's a question of fairness to low-income workers who pay taxes."  As for fears of disaster, "Anderson says there will be no excuse for not taking a minimum wage job when the cash payments end, because poor people will still get help; with food stamps, medical coverage, and child care."

<center><h2>Janet Cooke Award, from the January 1996 MediaWatch</h2></center>
<p>
<h3>CNN Describes Speaker as "Too Extreme" and "Scary," A "Clown Prince" with "Fits of Pique"<br>
Newt Gingrich, Political Liability?</h3>
<p>
Time selects its Man of the Year not by picking its favorite person, but the person with the most historical impact in that given year. In 1995, certainly, Newt Gingrich had a powerful impact on America's political debate. But that didn't mean Time had to like him -- and neither did CNN in producing a December 17 CNN Presents to announce the pick. For maligning the Speaker as a politically damaged and morally questionable figure after celebrating Time's choice of Bill Clinton in 1992, CNN earned the Janet Cooke Award.
<p>
CNN split its show between interviews with Gingrich and documentary segments. In the first segment, host Judy Woodruff used loaded language to describe Gingrich's "Path to Power," calling his ambition to be Speaker "An obsession that shaped almost every decision, every alliance, what some saw as every betrayal on his path to power." Woodruff relayed a rumor about Gingrich's first wife, Jackie: "It has become part of the Gingrich legend that he would later go to her hospital room where she was being treated for cancer to discuss a divorce." 
<p>
Woodruff described how Gingrich first came to the capital's attention: "In late-night tirades on C-SPAN, he needled then-House Speaker Tip O'Neill, painting ruling Democrats as corrupt thugs." Woodruff called him "a clown prince of an out-of-favor group." She concluded: "His self-ordained mission to save Western civilization is becoming overshadowed by a barrage of accusations that the most powerful Speaker in history illegally used political money." While CNN followed with Rep. David Bonior charging Gingrich's ethics are "in the toilet," Woodruff did not explain any of the charges, most of which were dismissed by the House ethics committee days later.
<p>
Another segment, titled "Homefront," explored Gingrich's hold on his constituency in Georgia: "Cobb County -- the soul of Newt country, Republican, white, well-educated, and affluent. The man who would wield the federal budget ax represents a county that exploded into suburban sprawl because of billions of federal dollars. Unemployment is low here, at 3.4 percent. It's well below the national average. And only a scant five percent of Cobb's population is on public assistance. The social fallout of the Contract with America if it passes will have little consequence here, but those hit will be hit hard."
<p>
CNN talked mostly to social service providers, liberal activists, and projected victims: "For the Hogan family, some cutbacks are the wrong thing to do. Daughter Kimberly, disabled from birth, has spent most of her life in a hospital. Thanks to Medicaid, this year has been different." Protesters held up signs reading "Newt: Your Plan Will Kill Us."
<p>

These documentary segments were heavily salted with Gingrich opponents: "The Path to Power" featured five negative talking heads (including three from Rep. Pat Schroeder and one of Bonior) to only three positive. "Homefront" featured twelve anti-Gingrich soundbites to four defenders. A segment called "Report Card" focusing on his future balanced the talking heads six to six, which included Bonior predicting that Gingrich's ethics problems were "so severe" he wouldn't be in office much longer.
<p>
If that hostility weren't enough, there were Woodruff's interview questions to the Speaker: "There's something we saw that was kind of interesting, the latest CNN-Time poll, they asked people what they thought about you and a lot of people said, most people said, very intelligent. A number of them said he has a vision for the future, but they also said -- a large number of those same people said, and I thought this was interesting, they agreed you were too extreme, 66 percent -- and out of touch, 52 percent, and even scary 49 percent. Where does that come from?"
<p>
When Gingrich suggested that things like being portrayed as Scrooge on the cover of Time didn't help, Woodruff replied: "But there's also been, in addition to that, what many people look at as the effect of the Republican budget cuts, and most of the people -- what they see is that most people, according to the studies we've seen, who would lose under the combined budget cuts and tax changes are the very poorest Americans, and people have a hard time understanding that."
<p>
Gingrich challenged that spin, but Woodruff reacted: "The study I'm referring to came out I think in the last week or so, by the Urban Institute, highly respected group, supposed to be nonpartisan -- and they set aside Medicaid and Medicare, they just looked at the budget cuts separate from Medicare and Medicaid and tax changes, and their conclusion was that the families that would lose under the Republican plan, two-thirds are in the poorest fifth of the population." The Urban Institute has often disseminated research that concludes with the need for more federal social spending.
<p>
Woodruff concluded the program with a decidedly negative spin: "He couldn't have envisioned the blizzard of ethics charges or the stir his fits of pique would cause. Now that they've gotten to know him, more than half of all Americans say they don't like him. More than half say they don't trust him. The irony is that Time's Man of the Year may wind up the biggest liability to the revolution he launched."
<p>
This program was a 180-degree change from the show CNN aired on December 26, 1992, when Bill Clinton was named Time's Man of the Year. The 30-minute show featured at least 18 positive talking heads, including Clintonites Robert Reich, Ron Brown, Dee Dee Myers, and Betsey Wright, Democratic Reps. Tom Foley and Lee Hamilton, Democratic consultant Bob Squier, and black academic Henry Louis Gates. Only one soundbite from conservative Arkansas editorialist Paul Greenberg offered any balance. 
<p>
The narration by CNN's Lou Waters and Natalie Allen said nothing about Clinton's troubled private life, nothing about ethics, nothing about overweening ambition. Allen began the show with a quotation: "He was not born a king, but a child of the common people who made himself a great persuader, therefore, a leader by dint of firm resolve, patient effort, and dogged perseverance." Chimed in Waters: "The words were written by Horace Greeley a century ago to describe Abraham Lincoln. They apply as well to this persevering young man from Arkansas, now leader of the Free World." Allen continued: "The election of 1992 was a leap of faith in a sour and unpredictable year. American voters were angry and disgusted and often afraid of the future. They took an enormous risk and made a fascinating choice." 
<p>
CNN prepared a response to MediaWatch questions, but it did not arrive by press time. It will appear next month. CNN may have contributed to the effect its polls have noticed: viewers were instructed that the Speaker was politically extreme, even scary, while Clinton was Honest Abe.

<center><h2>Newsbites, from the January 1996 MediaWatch</h2></center>
<h3>The Silent Veto.</h3>
Bill Clinton vetoed the welfare reform bill late on January 9, in an apparent attempt to avoid that night's news coverage. His concern was understandable; the veto would be an admission that he was breaking his famous campaign promise to "end welfare as we know it." 
<p>
Clinton worried needlessly: None of the network's January 10 evening news shows mentioned Clinton's veto, even after possible GOP opponent Bob Dole took to the Senate floor to criticize Clinton's betrayal. Although the media properly focused on criticism when George Bush broke his "no new taxes" campaign pledge, there was no focus on criticism of Clinton. The media missed another opportunity when Clinton held a press conference January 11. He was peppered with 18 questions, but not one raised the issue of his breaking his welfare promise, the crux of his effort to portray himself as a "New Democrat." 
<p>

<h3>Flattening Forbes. </h3>
At first glance, Steve Forbes' presidential campaign would seem to fulfill the media's standards for a proper Republican candidate: One with sufficiently soft stands on social issues to avoid the "divisive" label. Unable to attack Forbes as extremist (he has suitably "tolerant" stands on such issues as abortion and immigration), in the December 4 Time, Senior Writer Richard Stengel charged that "for all his patrician good humor, Forbes' message and his campaign have begun to show a hard edge." Stengel exploited a tenuous link between Forbes and Senator Jesse Helms' racially-tinged campaigns: "While Forbes generally shuns the politics of exclusion, he has nonetheless attracted to his organization two veterans of Jesse Helms' race-baiting campaigns." 
<p>
He also attacked Forbes' centerpiece flat tax proposal: "Despite his frequent protestations that he understands the needs of the average Joe, his flat-tax proposal would reward wealthy investors while leaving the burden on middle-class families." He added the plan would "do little to disabuse taxpayers of the notion that the rich get a better deal from the tax system." He cited data from the "generally liberal" Citizens for Tax Justice, stating a seventeen percent flat tax would produce a revenue shortfall of $200 billion. The group also claimed Dick Armey's similar flat tax plan would raise taxes on middle class families, estimating increases in the $1,740-$4,600 range on families earning between $45,000 and $85,000. 
<p>
Stengel didn't quote a conservative expert, but for a balancing view he could have referred to Time's very own flat tax analysis of April 17, when a CPA estimated how much tax a hypothetical family of four making $50,000 could expect to pay under the Armey plan. Time found the family's taxes would be cut by almost half, from $4,249 under the existing system to $2,244 under the Armey plan.
<p>

<h3>DeParle's Platform.</h3>
Twice in December, The New York Times provided a platform for reporter Jason DeParle's personal crusade against Republican welfare reforms. In the December 17 New York Times Magazine he depicted a post-welfare reform nightmare. DeParle wrote his story as an encyclopedia entry from the year 2015 that took a look back at the history of welfare. 
<p>
The fictitious excerpt presented welfare reform as an initial success when left to the states until a recession hit in 1999: "Faced with declining revenues and rising aid requests, states slashed their payments....With families crossing borders in search of aid, the `race to the bottom' ensued, with each state trying to be as tough as its neighbors." DeParle described an almost apocalyptic state where mothers were "arrested each year for locking their children in cars as they worked." DeParle predicted a million families would be "lining up at shelters, stealing into abandoned buildings and begging on street corners." DeParle continued his gloomy forecast: "Some became more reliant on abusive boyfriends, and reports of domestic violence rose. Abortion rates hit record levels and so did arrests for prostitution, leading several cities to decriminalize the practice in specified red-light zones."
<p>

DeParle's Other Platform. Two weeks earlier in a Times "Week in Review" piece, DeParle charged: "While the Republicans promise that the poor will prosper, the evidence does not. Indeed, most suggests the opposite: whether the economy or poor people are ultimately to blame, most will fail to replace their lost benefits. If the past is a guide, less will not mean more. Less will mean less, for those who already have little." 
<p>
DeParle criticized the GOP plan to let states run welfare, taking on supposed GOP arguments such as "The programs don't help much anyway," and "Earnings will improve with time." DeParle even refuted the notion that the poor actually "will be better off by working," answering: "Or will they? No one knows how many of the five million women of AFDC will be able to find and keep work. Many have few skills and lead the kinds of chaotic lives that interfere with full-time work: sick kids, dangerous neighborhoods, abusive boyfriends, broken cars."
<p>

<h3>Newt the Destroyer? </h3>
ABC previewed the Democratic strategy to hang Republican Tom Campbell with the "Newtoid" tag, but when the strategy backfired ABC ignored the results. In Carol Lin's December 10 piece for World News Sunday she highlighted Democrat Jerry Estruth's effort to defeat Republican Campbell in a special congessional election to replace retiring Democrat Norman Mineta. Anchor Carole Simpson introduced the story: "For all of Mr. Gingrich's power on Capitol Hill, opinion polls show his star is fading with American voters. So much so that one congressional candidate in California is using the Gingrich image to beat down his once-popular Republican opponent." 
<p>
Lin reported Campbell at one point had enjoyed a 43-point lead over Estruth. "Yet this political novice has managed to cut his popular Republican opponent's lead in half. By redefining the enemy. Estruth launched an ad campaign attacking House Speaker Newt Gingrich. And labeling Tom Campbell as a Gingrich clone." Lin pointed out that Campbell was more moderate than the Speaker on many issues, "But the strategy seems to be working. With more than a million dollars in donations pouring in." Lin continued, "Democrats hope Gingrich's negatives will be the central issue that can turn election campaigns across the country," before concluding: "Campbell is still the front runner in this race but only by a narrow margin. Democrats say that alone is still a victory for their party. Because they found their weapon. The man who started the Republican revolution may give frustrated voters reason enough to bring more Democrats back to office."
<p>
So, did ABC make it a big story when Campbell trounced Estruth by 23 points on December 12? No, not a word about the result on World News Tonight.  
<p>

<h3>Hot Media Air.</h3>
CBS and ABC have recently portrayed House Republicans as the catalysts to impending global doom, but have ignored scientific studies which back the GOP. "Some House Republicans are objecting to the global agreement to ban industrial chemicals widely believed to be depleting the earth's ozone layer," Dan Rather intoned on the November 23 CBS Evening News. Eric Engberg explained "that 150 countries have signed a treaty banning production of ozone depleting chemicals," but "to the number three Republican in the House, it's Chicken Little Stuff...Time out! Not proven? Didn't this year's Nobel Prize in chemistry go to Dr. Mario Molina and two others who discovered ozone depletion?" 
<p>
Over a month later, ABC's January 4 World News Tonight ran another alarmist warning. Peter Jennings began: "Two thousand scientists from all over the world agree the earth is getting warmer all the time, in part because the United States is not practicing what it has been preaching." Ned Potter followed, "scientists say if they [temperatures] keep going up as they have heat waves will spread across North America. A third of the world's glaciers will melt, flooding coastlines in dozens of countries. Tropical diseases will spread, exposing large parts of the U.S. to malaria." Potter charged that the Clinton administration "gave in to the petroleum and auto industries" and then he allowed Vice President Al Gore to blame the House GOP. 
<p>
But the need for action isn't so clear. Washington Post science writer Boyce Rensberger reported January 8 that of the three major studies of global temperatures during 1995 one reported an increase in average temperature, one called 1995 "ordinary," and one found some cooling. Guess which two the networks have ignored?
<p>

Moyers On Wages. PBS omnipresence Bill Moyers returned to Milwaukee for the December 19 Frontline to visit two families who suffered layoffs in 1991 at the motor company Briggs and Stratton. Moyers complained: "Good-paying jobs are heading south or out of the country and workers like Tony Neumann are searching desperately for new jobs that will support their families...In the early '90s, families like the Stanleys and Neumanns were thrown into a emerging new economy built on light manufacturing and service jobs. It was a time when unemployment hit record lows. But many of the new jobs offered only part-time work and no benefits, and they paid lower wages." Moyers concluded the show: "For working people all over America, real wages continue to decline."
<p>
But in a review on the morning before the show, a sequel to the 1992 program Minimum Wages, Washington Post reporter Steven Pearlstein told a story Moyers didn't: "In fact, today there are 12,000 more manufacturing jobs in the Milwaukee area than there were in the fall of 1991 when Claude Stanley and Tony Neumann were laid off, while the average hourly wage in manufacturing has climbed from $12.54 an hour to $13.98, just about keeping pace with inflation." Pearlstein added that Briggs and Stratton motors are now cheaper for consumers and the company is making money for its stockholders.
<p>

Rather Embarrassed. While on Denver's KOA talk radio host Mike Rosen's program, Dan Rather tried to defend himself and his network against charges of bias. Rosen questioned Rather's repeated use of the word "cut" when describing the Republican Medicare plan on the CBS Evening News. Rather shot back, "Some of the time we use the language, `Medicare cuts,' which is what the Democrats insist these are, and some of the time we use that these are, `cuts in the rate of growth for Medicare,' which is what the Republicans prefer. We try to walk that line, we try to call it one way one time, one way the next time."
<p>
A review of Evening News broadcasts from September 20, the night before the Republicans unveiled their Medicare plan, to November 28, when Rather appeared on Rosen's program, shows the CBS anchor should pay closer attention to what comes out of his mouth. During this period, Rather used the Democratic spin term `cuts' eight times such as when Rather announced as fact on September 20: "Democrats and Republicans in Congress late today came close to actual physical blows over proposed cuts in Medicare. That's the separate U.S. government health care coverage for 37 million older Americans of all income levels. There's no doubt that Medicare spending will be cut, the question is how much and for how many." On October 25 he claimed that "Republicans vowed to press for huge cuts in government spending and $245 billion in tax cuts. President Clinton vowed to veto it as too radical and extreme."
<p>

He applied the phrase that best described reality, "reducing the rate of growth," or "reducing spending" three times. He relayed the Republican spin, "making the plan solvent" just once; hardly the "one way one time, one way the next time" which Rather claimed.

<h3>Networks Search for Victims in the Wake of Second Budget Stalemate<br>
The Shutdown Soap Opera</h3>
<p>
December brought a second shutdown of the federal government, and with it came the networks' ratings-grabbing specialty: hanky-waving sob stories of shutdown "victims."
<p>
On December 22, a week into the shutdown and before paychecks were delayed, Jack Smith mourned on World News Tonight: "The shutdown now has a human face. Joe Skattleberry and his wife Lisa both work for the government. Both have been furloughed. They can't afford a Christmas tree."
<p>
NBC's John Palmer warned on the December 29 Today: "The shutdown is affecting more people's lives every day in places like Grand Teton National Park, where furloughed park employees worried about mortgages, car payments, and  credit card bills have begun filing unemployment benefits. In California and in dozens of other states, serious cutbacks in food programs are threatened unless the budget crisis is resolved soon." Later, David Bloom added: "The shutdown continues. The pain spreads. The pressure grows for Washington to end America's worst budget crisis."
<p>
On January 2, CBS Evening News reporter Scott Pelley compared budget negotiators to bombers: "In April, terrorists tried to kill them. Today, politicians stopped their paychecks. In Oklahoma City's Social Security office, they're being ordered to work for nothing....The bomb broke Beverly Rankin's ankle. Politics is breaking her bank." 
<p>
That night NBC Nightly News anchor Tom Brokaw mourned: "Far from the marbled halls of Congress and the elegant furnishings of the White House, this government shutdown is about a lot more than politics. It's about people and their real needs."
<p>
NBC's George Lewis found an Indian health clinic in San Diego: "Two-thirds of the clinic's budget, $95,000 a month, comes from the federal government. Without that money, the clinic can't meet its payroll. The people who run this clinic fear that if it has to close its doors, many of the 4,000 patients who seek treatment here will not look elsewhere. Ron Morton says traditionally, Native Americans do not like to accept handouts." But didn't NBC just say the clinic is two-thirds funded by the federal government? Morton later asserted that "if this budget is not signed there are people who are going to die."
<p>
Bryant Gumbel preached at the start of the January 4 Today: "Although some politicians have foolishly suggested the fact that we are going on about our business despite the absence of the workers says maybe they weren't needed anyway, we will show you how some average Americans are suffering each and every day as a result of what is now 20 days of the government shutdown."

<h3>Today Gushes Over Hillary<br>
"Really Terrific" Book</h3>
<p>
As questions swirled around Hillary Clinton's veracity on Whitewater and the travel office, NBC News gave her a gift: a January 16 Today interview by Maria Shriver, who campaigns for and donates to her uncle Ted Kennedy's Senate campaigns. Shriver served more as political flack than journalistic inquisitor. Shriver opened the show by calling Clinton's new book, It Takes a Village, "really terrific."
<p>
Her first question: "What's this last week and a half been like for you personally?" She followed up about daughter Chelsea: "What has she said to you about these attacks?...This is beyond the territory....This is your mom that someone's talking about." After wondering if she'd be willing to testify before the Senate and posing one question about the travel office, Shriver showed sympathy for Clinton's plight: "Whitewater, I know you've been answering questions on this subject for four years, thousands of pieces of documents have been handed over, but they still want even more. As you look back on this, do you wish you'd never worked for Madison Guaranty?"
<p>
Shriver did ask: "Regarding these billing records that came about that had been subpoenaed two years ago, people say, `Gosh, how could a woman as smart and politically savvy as Hillary Clinton not know where these records were these past two years? Why didn't she make that her priority to find them, particularly when they were found in her own home, under an assistant's desk?'"
<p>
Shriver returned to softballs: "You also quote a letter in there that Nelson Mandela wrote to one of his daughters while he was in prison, and I'm paraphrasing a bit, but he wrote that there is no personal misfortune that one cannot turn into a personal triumph if one has the iron will and the necessary skills. You clearly have an iron will, you clearly are skilled. How are you going to turn this personal misfortune into a personal triumph?"
<p>
Shriver then stumped for liberalism: "You think government should do a lot more than it's doing in terms of making children a priority, doing things for kids. We're clearly living in an age where people are anti-government. How do you get across the message that we all need to see everybody's kids as our own, we need to have more programs, the government needs to be more involved?"

<h3>Brinkley Agrees Media are Liberal<br>
Paula Zahn is "Overloaded"</h3>
<p>
In a December 7 appearance on CNBC's Cal Thomas, David Brinkley reacted with dismay when read a quote from the MRC's Best Notable Quotables of 1995: The Eighth Annual Awards for the Year's Worst Reporting.
<p>
Thomas, one of the judges who voted on which quotes deserved inclusion in the year-end issue, asked: "Could you get away, for example, with asking a question like this, that was recently asked by a major network anchor of Pat Buchanan...`You've got political enemies out there calling you an isolationist, a bigot, you're anti-gay, and some even go so far as saying your social stands are reminiscent of Nazi Germany.' Now that's the kind of ideologically loaded stuff that turns a lot of people off, isn't it?"
<p>
Brinkley agreed: "That is so loaded, it's overloaded and it destroys itself in its own excess. Nobody would ever take that question seriously, I wouldn't even bother to answer it." Though Brinkley didn't know it, the quote, first runner-up for the "Damn Those Conservatives Award," came from Paula Zahn's July 5 CBS This Morning interview.
<p>
Earlier in the show the former NBC anchor and current This Week host acknowledged liberal bias."Well, it's there and it doesn't show itself in everything that is printed or broadcast but it is there, and I think we're all used to it, we discount it. Some of the press also is more conservative and it's just the way the action is in this country and I don't know any way to change it. You just have to live with it."

<center><h2>Revoving Door, from the January 1996 MediaWatch</h2></center>
<h3>If You Can't Boost 'Em...</h3>
<p>
Just weeks after writing a piece for The New Republic denouncing Republican efforts to shut down AmeriCorps, Newsweek Deputy Washington Bureau Chief Steven Waldman decided he could do more good helping run the government program than he could as an external advocate. In mid-January he became senior adviser for policy planning and evaluation for former Senator Harris Wofford (D-Penn.), the new Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation for National Service, overseer of AmeriCorps and VISTA. 
<p>
Waldman "explained that the program's recent change in leadership convinced him that the move would be ethical even though he's written extensively about the program," National Journal reported.
<p>
"Republican attacks on AmeriCorps have been bizarrely hyperbolic," Waldman charged in the November 13 New Republic. "The GOP has also practiced gross statistics-abuse in order to portray AmeriCorps, inaccurately, as a boondoggle." He predicted that "when Republicans calm down and start picking bits of safety net from their teeth, they will undoubtedly feel silly. They will realize that AmeriCorps -- which gives college scholarships to young men and women who do full-time community service -- was the solution to their dilemma of how to dismantle the welfare state without seeming cruel."
<p>
Earlier in 1995 Waldman, part of Newsweek's Washington bureau since 1987, wrote The Bill, a book detailing the creation of AmeriCorps. It grew out of a "behind-the-scenes" look at the program for the September 20, 1993 Newsweek, in which he concluded: "John F. Kennedy attracted to his Peace Corps a narrow group of mostly white, well-educated Americans. Clinton's plan is far more ambitious, seeking to regenerate fragmented American communities and break down rock-hard barriers of the heart. Because Clinton must confront the emotional issues of race and class, he is more likely to fail. But should he succeed, Clinton will have accomplished something far more significant than his hero ever did."
<p>
AmeriCorps is hardly the only area in which Waldman has been a liberal advocate. He co-authored a September 19, 1994 piece headlined, "The Lost Chance" with the subhead, "The Clintons: Newsweek reveals how they set out to reform a broken health care system -- and squandered a historic opportunity." One impediment: those who spent money "on blatantly untrue advertisements meant to scare the public."
<p>
A few issues later his byline accompanied a story on the Contract with America: "The problem is that the Contract's main idea has already been tried and discredited. House Republicans are now pledged to tax cuts, increased defense spending, and a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. Sound familiar? `This was a dopey political move,' [Rep. Fred] Grandy says. `We were holding the high ground on welfare, foreign policy, so why would we go back and shoosh down the Laffer Curve? This is like giving the Democrats a nuclear weapon.'" 
<p>

<h3>Being Frank</h3>
<p>
A CNN veteran is the new Deputy Press Secretary to Senator Frank Lautenberg. Ken Jaques, an off-air reporter in the CNN political unit from 1992 to 1994, has come aboard the New Jersey Democrat's staff, Roll Call reported December 21.

<p>
<h3>Networks Mourn Victims of Second Shutdown, Single Out Republicans for Blame<br>
Same Liberal Song, Second Verse</h3>
<p>
As a second partial government shutdown descended on Washington, network coverage once again favored President Clinton's arguments  over those of House Republicans. Last month, MediaWatch examined coverage during the November 13-20 shutdown and found not a single story noted how much more than the GOP  Clinton wanted to spend. No story questioned his rhetoric about "destroying" Medicare even though the GOP plan called for hikes. Reporters conveyed the Democratic spin about the disastrous impact upon federal workers and the public.
<p>
As a new budget impasse began in mid-December, MediaWatch analysts reviewed all 131 budget-related stories on evening newscasts (ABC's World News Tonight, CBS Evening News, NBC Nightly News, and CNN's World News) from the evening before the shutdown (December 14) through the day it ended (January 5).
<p>
After President Clinton vetoed several spending bills, not one story blamed Clinton for the shutdown, but nearly two dozen declared the GOP culpable. Furloughed workers and other "victims" were featured in half the stories while no story explored the "Washington Monument" stategy or the financial boost offered by a balanced budget.
<p>
Blame. To fund the government, Congress passes appropriation bills which the President must then sign. Clinton vetoed spending bills on December 18 and 19 that would have kept open six cabinet departments. But on the question of who caused the shutdown, reporters exclusively pointed a finger at the Republicans. In the 48 stories in which reporters allocated blame, 23 assigned blame to the Republicans, but not one held Clinton culpable (25 blamed both).
<p>
On December 16, when the government's temporary spending authority ran out, Bob Schieffer led off the CBS Evening News like a disappointed father: "Well, they've done it again. Nine days from Christmas, Republicans have forced another partial shutdown of the government because they cannot come to an agreement with the White House on how to balance the budget." The next night, ABC's Jerry King also blamed the GOP. "There's no indication from House Republicans, whose budget-cutting zeal started all of this, that they are ready, Christmas season or not, to end it."
<p>
During the negotiations that followed the vetoes, reporters repeatedly blamed Republicans for not compromising. On December 23 CNN's Wolf Blitzer pined for an earlier time: "In the old days, the two sides would simply have split the differences, but House Republicans say they are proud to be revolutionaries...From the White House perspective there's still one very big wild card: the most militant House Republicans say they're in no mood to compromise. The question remains whether Speaker Gingrich can reign them in, or wants to."
<p>
Even as Clinton delayed agreement by breaking his promises to release a seven-year balanced budget, the networks still blamed the GOP. ABC's Peter Jennings intoned on January 4, "We begin in Washington tonight, where the Republicans and the Clinton administration may be inching their way towards a partial resolution of the government shutdown. President Clinton and the Republican leaders in Congress have been meeting almost daily this week, but today the Republicans apparently felt the need to reassess their position, which has kept a quarter of a million government employees off the job."
<p>
Spending. None of the 131 stories compared the higher levels of spending both sides proposed. Only two mentioned the levels of spending in the President's plan or the Republican plan, one coming not in a news story, but in a CBS commentary by Joe Klein.
<p>
Federal Workers. Only 280,000 workers were placed on furlough, just 15 percent of the work force. Still, the media focused on the issue in nearly half the stories (62), while only three reports focused on overburdened taxpayers. ABC's John Martin examined those angry at the de facto paid vacation on December 18: "This time government workers have an added worry -- Congress has been hearing from people who do not want to pay furloughed workers as they were paid after last month's shutdown."
<p>
"Victims." Sixty-seven of 131 stories mentioned a victim of the shutdown. Thirty stories called attention to families being turned away from National Parks or Smithsonian Museums. On December 22, CBS looked at how the stalemate canceled a re-creation of an Olde English Christmas banquet. John Blackstone reported, "For thousands of people, a Christmas dream is a traditional Christmas in Yosemite National Park. But the budget stalemate has closed the park gates and Yosemite's old fashioned Christmas is slipping away....The valley has somehow been drained of a seasonal joy it's known for almost 70 years." Although not by a reporter, in this story both sides were blamed as one of the participants wrote a poem about the cancellation in which she referred to Newt Gingrich as "slimebucket" and Clinton as "sleaze."
<p>
"Washington Monument." Not one report brought up the "Washington Monument" game being played when high profile services, like national parks and passport offices are closed in order to maximize inconvenience. No report questioned why these services were stopped even though, as The Wall Street Journal found, one-third of the federal workers at the Interior Department and two-thirds of State Department employees were considered essential and thus were on the job. 
<p>
Upside to the Shutdown. If you relied exclusively on the evening news, you would never have thought there was an upside to the shutdown. Only twice did a report call attention to a positive effect of the shutdown. Both were on CNN and dealt with the airline ticket tax expiring at the end of 1995. Anchor Linden Soles announced on January 1, "Washington's budget battle has reaped a windfall for air travelers," saving these travelers $12 million a day. But NBC anchor Brian Williams saw just the opposite the same day: "We have this footnote to the mess here in Washington tonight, because of it a tax on domestic airline tickets expired at midnight so while the budget negotiators are arguing about the best way to save money, the government is actually losing money."
<p>
Similarly, never mentioned were the benefits of a balanced budget. The Washington Post reported January 4 that experts estimated a balanced budget would give $1,000 annually to families through lower interest rates.  
<p>
For years, the media have complained about politicians ducking the tough issues; debating slogans, not substance. Finally, a substantive policy dispute presents itself. Unfortunately, the media aren't able to overcome their biases and look beyond the very bumper sticker politics they formerly decried.

ABC Promotes A Green "Demonstration" That Didn't Happen, Ignores March for Life
<p>
The Evangelical Right Wing That Wasn't 
<p>
Pro-life activists gather together in the nation's capital every January 22 to mark the anniversary of the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide. This year, 60,000 came to Washington for the annual March for Life, but the networks didn't pay much attention.
<p>
NBC Nightly News and CBS Evening News each gave the event 19 seconds. CBS followed up with a long story about the federal investigation into anti-abortion violence. CNN also had an anchor brief, although reporter Anthony Collings did a story the night before. On the day of the march, CNN's Inside Politics didn't mention the march, but devoted more than seven minutes to an interview with pro-choice Republicans Ann Stone and Julie Finley.
<p>
ABC's World News Tonight didn't even mention the march. But just nine days later, on January 31, Peter Jennings announced a "major demonstration on behalf of the environment designed to pressure those congressional Republicans who wish to eliminate or dilute many of the country's environmental laws. ABC's Barry Serafin reports that the pressure comes from a group of the Republican conservatives' strongest supporters." For ignoring the march of religious conservatives against abortion and then promoting the activities of a small group of religious liberals as if they were conservatives, ABC earned the Janet Cooke Award. 
<p>
Serafin explained: "Protecting the environment is a relatively new issue for evangelical Christians. But a group called the Evangelical Environmental Network [EEN] says it will spend a million dollars on a campaign to block efforts by congressional conservatives to weaken the Endangered Species Act, starting with a television commercial in 18 states." ABC aired a section of the ad which asserted: "The Endangered Species Act has rescued dozens of God's creatures from extinction. But today, the Act itself is threatened."
<p>
Serafin added that the group encouraged children to write letters lobbying Newt Gingrich to stop the GOP bill, before concluding: "The evangelical delegation in Washington delivered some of the children's letters, but it was unable to meet with Gingrich today. Gingrich's position on the Endangered Species Act is still a question. A bigger question is how congressional conservatives will deal with opposition from those they usually consider political allies." 
<p>
ABC's report was grossly misleading for a number of reasons. Despite Jennings' insistence, there was no "major demonstration." ABC showed no video of a demonstration, only a shot of a few professionals in overcoats walking outside the Capitol. In other words, ABC had ignored a major demonstration of 60,000 pro-lifers, only to cover one that did not even occur. The Environmental Information Center (EIC), which other news accounts identified as the million-dollar funder behind the evangelical group's ads against GOP reform of the Endangered Species Act, told MediaWatch there was no demonstration, only a press conference. 
<p>
In an August 19, 1995 Washington Post story about the activities of the liberal environmental groups Greenpeace, U.S. Public Interest Research Group, and the Sierra Club to stop Republican proposals to strengthen the rights of property owners, reporter Gary Lee noted the liberal strategy behind the founding of EIC: "The major conservation groups and a few private donors and foundations pooled their resources last spring to create the Environmental Information Center, a new lobbying organization charged with doing whatever it takes to stop the anti-environmental tide in Washington." 
<p>
The Post noted EIC spent $1.3 million during last year's House debate on regulatory reform on TV ads saying "Don't let Congress roll back 25 years of environmental progress." But ABC identified these liberal activists as "a group of the Republican conservatives' strongest supporters" and "those they usually consider political allies." 
<p>
Not only has the Environmental Evangelical Network taken sides on the environmental issues, it has taken sides against the religious right as well. The February 1 San Diego Union Tribune noted EEN leaders "were critical of the environmental stands of some conservative Christian groups, such as the politically influential Christian Coalition." ABC aired a soundbite of Ron Sider, President and founder of Evangelicals for Social Action, the EEN's parent organization. But they did not note he signed a document last May called the "Cry for Renewal." The primary authors of the letter, leftist Sojourners magazine editor Jim Wallis and Clinton friend Tony Campolo, declared their intention to create a "progressive evangelical caucus" to challenge traditionally conservative evangelical events and hold town meetings to address community problems like "gay bashing." ABC did not reconcile Sider's partisan press conference with his signature on the "Cry for Renewal" document, which declared "religion as a political cheerleader is inevitably false as religion."
<p>
ABC denigrated Republican stands with pejorative adjectives ("eliminate," "dilute," "weaken") without allowing the GOP to explain their side of the debate. Rep. Don Young (R-Alaska), chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, and Rep. Richard Pombo (R-Calif.) issued a press release the day after the ABC telecast asking the Evangelical Environmental Network to be honest in their characterization of the Republican bill, which currently has 126 co-sponsors in the House. Among the major provisions of the bill is an actual increase in funding for Endangered Species Act programs. 
<p>
ABC's blindness to opposing views extended to free-market environmental experts like Ike Sugg of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, who told MediaWatch the Young-Pombo bill "doesn't go nearly far enough. They tried to pre-emptively compromise, and Gingrich is seeking to water it down further. The Republicans are not guilty of what they're accused of."
<p>
Sugg added: "The Young-Pombo bill is a step in the right direction since it weakens the federal government's power over private land use. But the current Endangered Species Act has created perverse incentives for property owners to remove any possibility of endangered species appearing on their property. It creates an enmity between wildlife and land owners. The ESA's supporters care more about saving the act than saving wildlife." 
<p>
Serafin did not return phone calls to discuss his story. ABC's story contrast suggests the irony of their biases. Their focus suggests heart-tugging concern for the kangaroo rat, but not the unborn child. ABC sometimes labels the religious right as "ultraconservative," but the religious left receives no label, or worse yet, is portrayed as conservative. But the worst characteristic of their reporting is the absolute refusal to acknowledge that issues they advance with partisan passion have more than one side.

<p>
<h3>Tricky Dick's Tax Break.</h3>
When Rep. Jennifer Dunn (R-Wash.) filed an ethics complaint against House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt for possibly illegally evading capital gains taxes on a land swap, the story's hypocrisy angle seemed obvious. Insight reported last summer that Gephardt, who dem-agogues against capital gains tax cuts as windfalls for the rich, listed a beachfront property he was purchasing as an investment property, thus avoiding tax on a $79,500 capital gain. To obtain a loan to build on the North Carolina property, he signed a covenant pledging the house would be used as a second home, and not as an investment property. 
<p>
Reporters had two chances to make Gephardt's hypocrisy a news story, one when Dunn filed the complaint February 2, and another when Gephardt's lawyer denied the allegations a week later. Despite short stories in The Washington Post and The New York Times, in both cases the network evening news programs completely ignored the allegations.
<p>

<h3>Newt Left Hanging.</h3>
Last July, when the National Republican Congressional Committee printed a Wanted poster featuring targeted Democrats, CNN thoroughly covered the ensuing outrage from Democrats. The NRCC Wanted poster merely pictured Democratic incumbents up for re-election in 1996. CNN gave the most coverage overall of the poster, airing stories on the July 10 and July 15 Inside Politics as well as on World News for July 12 and 13. Declared anchor Bobbie Battista: "Some of the Democrats pictured on a Republican Wanted poster are complaining the ad is racist and could even put their lives in danger." The next day anchor Linden Soles reported, "Democrats say the poster is racist, anti-semitic and could even lead to physical attacks against them." 
<p>
So where was CNN when the Democratic National Committee (DNC) posted a Hangman game on its Web site that depicted Newt Gingrich as hanging from a gallows? According to John Pitney in the January 29 Weekly Standard, "For each correct guess, the site added a new part to a stick figure and displayed a different quotation from Gingrich. At the end of the game, the screen showed the stick figure hanging from a gallows, above the game's magic word: EXTREMIST." Surely, the lynching of the Speaker of the House on an official DNC computer Web page deserved at least a brief spot. But neither CNN's Inside Politics or The World Today aired a report on the Hangman game. A review of the three other major networks showed they also failed to mention the DNC's ghoulish depiction of Gingrich on the gallows.
<p>

<h3>PBS on Privates.</h3>
Are the personal lives of politicians relevant? Apparently, the PBS answer is "only if they're Republicans." On January 16, the tax-funded documentary series Frontline devoted an hour to the rise of Newt Gingrich, which included tales of how friends had to raise money to feed Newt's kids because he wouldn't pay alimony. Frontline also aired a man heckling Gingrich at a book signing: "You profess family values. This is hidden wisdom in the Holy Bible. And I want to know where it says oral sex doesn't count as adultery. I'd like you to sign it because, you know, you've been cheating on your wife. You've been crying family values. I don't know where it says oral sex is moral while you're trying to take away children's rights and children's benefits." 
<p>
But Frontline has almost completely avoided dealing with Bill Clinton's sex life. The only snippet came on March 3, 1992, in a documentary on racist David Duke, who declared: "I am not a wizard under the sheets. I have to leave that title to Bill Clinton from Arkansas." But that's about it. The October 21, 1992 Frontline titled "The Choice," a two-hour history of Bush and Clinton, leaped at the very end from Clinton's announcement speech in 1991 to the Los Angeles riots. There was no Gennifer Flowers. In 1995, Frontline aired "What Happened to Bill Clinton?" The answer: He hadn't been liberal enough. PBS said nothing about the allegations of state troopers or the sexual harassment lawsuit of Paula Jones.

<h3>Another Travelgate Yawn.</h3>
While promoting her new book in January, First Lady Hillary Clinton defended her role in the May 1993 firing of the White House Travel Office staff. She said "financial mismanagement" justified the action. But a  recent audit by the General Accounting Office shows that whatever the situation in 1993, it has only gotten worse.
<p>
According to an Associated Press story that appeared in the January 30 Washington Post and Washington Times, an audit by the General Accounting Office found: "The current travel office rarely follows its own policy of paying vendors, such as airlines and telephone companies, within 45 days of the invoice date....office employees never balanced checkbooks from January through August 1995." The audit also found that the office's accounts receivable had soared to $5.6 million under the new management, while the employees that were fired had only $366,000. The new employees also forgot to enter over $200,000 in deposits into the office's checking accounts.
<p>
The audit drew little national media attention. The New York Times, Los Angeles Times and USA Today all failed to report the embarrassing revelations. With the exception of the NewsHour on PBS, no network evening news show ran a story. Neither did Time or Newsweek.
<p>

<h3>Hillary's Decade of Greed.</h3>
Newsweek's Martha Brant and Evan Thomas analyzed the duality of Hillary Clinton in the January 15 issue. Instead of condemning her as a hypocrite for trashing the "greed is good" 1980s in public while cashing in on her influence in private, the Newsweek duo marveled at her "missionary zeal" as a liberal crusader. "The same zeal that is so impressive in her fight for worthy causes," Brant and Thomas suggested, "can also lead her (at best) to be politically insensitive and (at worst) to be ruthless about getting her way." 
<p>
The article shows why Hillary never resorted to ruthlessness when dealing with the press on Whitewater; reporters like Brant and Thomas are willing to rationalize her behavior: "It has fallen mostly to Hillary to finance the Clinton's public service. (As governor, her husband never earned more than $35,000 a year.) To the outside world, her commodities trading -- a $1,000 investment to make $100,000 -- looks suspiciously cozy. And the family's lost investment in the failed Whitewater land development has the smell of a sweet deal turned sour...Although she would never admit it, she may feel that she was relatively restrained in Little Rock, given the temptations of her position and the culture of the place. For a governor's wife who was also a senior partner in a politically connected law firm, the opportunity for lucrative deals must have been huge."
<p>
Zuckerman's Zero Interest. Liberals often claim that media owners push the media to the right. Not so at U.S. News & World Report where owner Mortimer Zuckerman liked investigating George Bush, but is not so happy about probing the Clintons. Zuckerman used a two-page editorial on January 29 to lambaste Republican handling of the Whitewater hearings. He recalled Joseph Welch's famous dictum, "Have you no sense of decency?" from the Army-McCarthy hearings of the 1950s as he regurgitated the Clintons' public relations line that a report prepared for the RTC by former Republican U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens cleared the Clintons. On the issue of the billing records that were discovered nearly two years after being subpoenaed (and which contradict the RTC report), Zuckerman wrote: "What about the time sheets showing the amount of legal work that Hillary Clinton performed for the failed S&L?...Again, no. Her role...was minimal." 
<p>
The editorial led to a January 26 guest appearance on Michael Jackson's KABC talk show in Los Angeles. Talk Daily reported that "he called the charges against the Clintons `outrageous' (a term he used several times)," claimed that in the First Lady's Madison dealings "all transactions were legitimate," was "disgusted" by the investigation and considered much of the press coverage a "witch hunt." 
<p>
Zuckerman's U.S. News piece also attacked fellow journalists for investigating a Democrat: "The press has slipped its moorings here...The two questions now -- what did the President's wife know and when did she know it? -- seem a childish irrelevance by comparison [to Watergate]." However in his own June 22, 1992 editorial on Iraqgate, Zuckerman suggested the Bush administration obstructed justice, claiming: "Certainly the attempts to limit inquiries by Congress on the spurious grounds of national security smell of coverup....In short, what did the administration know and when did it know it?"
<p>

<h3>California Scheming. </h3>
Host Jane Pauley's introduction to the January 23 Dateline NBC dripped with sarcasm: "Do you feel that everyone is after your job, and they just might have an unfair advantage? That people can criticize you and it's OK? Are you a white American male? In California, two men have taken up the cause of the beleaguered species. They've written a ballot proposal that, if passed in November, would change affirmative action in California's state hiring and education admissions." Reporter Josh Mankiewicz charged, "They (Glynn Custred and Tom Wood) are portrayed as `genial scholars,' just two `apolitical professors,' an image Wood and Custred have worked hard to maintain."
<p>
Then Mankiewicz moved to discredit them: "The two are key figures in a conservative organization...very critical of many aspects of higher education, including black and women's studies, sexual harassment policies, the emphasis on racial diversity, and affirmative action." John Leo of U.S. News & World Report took exception to the Mankiewicz segment in the February 19 issue: "Senator Joe himself couldn't have phrased this better. It artfully left the impression that NAS [the National Association of Scholars, to which Wood and Custred belong] is a sinister, antiwoman, antiblack group." In fact, Leo noted that "a prominent Marxist, Eugene Genovese, sits on the board of advisers."
<p>
Mankiewicz criticized the men for not having statistics on how many white men have suffered discrimination, but Leo pointed out "Nobody has good statistics on this. Since a lot of reverse discrimination is legal under Title VII [of the Civil Rights Act], many who are hurt by it never bother to file any complaints and thus don't get counted."
<p>

<h3>Judge Baer Not Bared.</h3>
<p>
When Federal Judge Harold Baer threw out the key evidence  in a New York drug arrest, $4 million in cocaine and heroin, only one news magazine noted that the Clinton administration had appointed the judge. All four networks ran stories on the case, explaining how the judge tossed the evidence, which officers found in a duffel bag they earlier saw being placed inside a car, under the guise of it being obtained through an illegal search. A story on NBC's February 6 Dateline noted that the woman charged admitted to being a drug runner and that Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) now regretted suggesting Baer be nominated. But none of the networks noted the Clinton link. 
<p>
U.S. News & World Report was the only news magazine to make the connection between Clinton and Baer. However reporter Ted Gest, writing in the February 12 issue, failed to tie Baer's ruling with any liberal leanings. Analyzing the administration's judicial choices, he wrote, "Clinton's Supreme Court choices, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, are moderates, and so are most of his lower court appointees...Assistant Attorney General Eleanor Acheson...stresses diversity without sacrificing quality." Quality that let a $4 million admitted drug trafficker go free.

<center><h2>Front Page story, from the February 1996 MediaWatch</h2></center>
<h3>CBS Reporter Bernard Goldberg Charges Colleague, <br>Media with Liberal Bias
Reality Check for Eric Engberg</h3></center>
<p>
This month MediaWatch planned to include an article about CBS reporter Eric Engberg's February 8 CBS Evening News "Reality Check" attack on Steve Forbes' flat tax. But one of Engberg's colleagues beat us to it. In an unprecedented February 13 Wall Street Journal op-ed, CBS reporter Bernard Goldberg said that "Mr. Engberg's report set new standards for bias." Reaction was swift: CBS News President Andrew Heyward tagged the charge "absurd." 
<p>
Goldberg began by observing that one reason fewer people are watching network news "is that our viewers simply don't trust us. And for good reason. The old argument that the networks and other `media elites' have a liberal bias is so blatantly true that it's hardly worth discussing anymore. No, we don't sit around in dark corners and plan strategies on how we're going to slant the news. We don't have to. It comes naturally to most reporters."
<p>
Reciting the story, he noted that Engberg showed Forbes saying the "economy can grow twice as fast if we remove `obstacles,' starting with the tax code. Mr. Forbes may be right or wrong about this, so Mr. Engberg lets us know which it is. `Time Out!' he shouts in his signature style. `Economists say nothing like that has ever actually happened.'"  
<p>
Next, Engberg showed Forbes asserting "A flat tax would enable the economy to grow. That would mean more revenue for Washington." To that "Engberg tells the audience: `That was called supply- side economics under President Reagan. Less taxes equal more revenue. It didn't work out that way.'" Engberg then allowed an economist from the Brookings Institution, which he failed to label as liberal, to predict the same thing would happen again. 
<p>
Goldberg wondered: "But haven't other experts argued that we wound end up with `hideous deficits' not because of the tax cut but because of increased spending?"
<p>
Engberg offered this snide hit: "OK, how about Forbes' number one wackiest flat tax promise?" In a clip, Forbes explained how "parents would have more time to spend with their children, and with each other." Goldberg queried, "can you imagine, in your wildest dreams, a network news reporter calling Hillary Clinton's health care plan `wacky?'" Engberg concluded: "The fact is, the flat tax is one giant untested theory. One economist suggested that before we risk putting it in, we ought to try it out someplace, like maybe Albania." 
<p>
"Reality Check," Goldberg explained, "suggests the viewers are going to get the facts. And then they can make up their mind. As Mr. Engberg might put it: `Time Out!' You'd have a better chance of getting the facts someplace else -- like Albania."

<h3>Networks Scared of Flat Tax<br>
Furious At Forbes</h3>
<p>
The higher Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes rose in the polls, the more reporters felt compelled to discredit his flat tax proposal, often by trying to stir class envy.
<p>
In the February 8 Investor's Business Daily reporter Thomas McArdle uncovered the agenda. In mid-January ABC News interviewed Alvin Rabushka, a Senior Fellow with the Hoover Institution and an architect of the flat tax idea, for a Peter Jennings piece. 
Rabushka told McArdle that "the cameras rolled for an hour, and throughout the hour, over and over again, he kept trying to get me to agree it would be a tax on the middle class, if not in the long run, then at least in the interim period. And over and over I wouldn't say it." Rabushka concluded that Jennings just wanted to "get me to say the 18-second soundbite he wanted to use to discredit Steve Forbes."
<p>
Indeed, Rabushka did not appear in Jennings' January 15 World News Tonight story in which he tagged the flat tax as "a very radical notion." Jennings wondered "Will plumbers be hurt more than plutocrats? President Clinton believes that middle class homeowners will see the value of their homes go down if there is no mortgage deduction. And charities worry about how generous folks will be if their contribution is no longer deductible. Certainly the rich would do better than the middle class."
<p>
Two days later NBC's Mike Jensen looked at three families, concluding as fact: "For poor and middle class families, critics say the 17 percent flat tax is a cruel hoax, that to avoid big deficits, it would have to be much higher than 17 percent. So not only would it fail to help the poor, it would increase taxes for most middle class Americans."
<p>
Nightline devoted its February 1 edition to a 30-minute assault. Robert Krulwich went through four supposed benefits of the flat tax, concluding each was wrong. As for fairness, he decided that "it doesn't seem fair that while" millionaire candidate Morry Taylor "pays zero tax on his $15 million" in stock sales, "his employees -- because they're not getting stock, they're on a salary -- they pay a 17 percent tax on their money; but that's what happens when you eliminate capital gains."
<p>
As for whether it's simpler, Krulwich decided it's not because not everyone will really be able to do their taxes on a postcard. Moving on to the third claim of lower taxes for everyone, he countered: "Sounds wonderful, but then Forbes' tax helps some more than others, especially wealthy families. Still, somebody must lose and the government could be the big loser. Forbes' tax could cut government revenues by $40 billion a year or $180 billion, depending upon who you ask, which means deeper cuts in programs" or bigger deficits.
<p>
On the last claim, that it "will be good for the economy," he explained how "Forbes is an old-fashioned, kick-up-your-heels optimist. He believes if you don't tax savings, people will save a lot more. If you don't tax investment income, people will invest a lot more, and in the end, the economy will grow a lot more." He countered that "history does not bless Steve Forbes' optimism." For the rest of the show Ted Koppel interviewed two opponents: Newsweek columnist Robert Samuelson and the magazine's Wall Street editor Allan Sloan, who sneered, "when I first heard it, I almost fell on the floor laughing wondering how anyone could take it seriously."

<h3>Global Warming Shtick Returns<br>
The Heat Is Off </h3>
<p>
Snow in Arizona, ice in Mississippi, and record low temperatures in between? It must be global warming. So said Newsweek's January 22 cover story: "The Hot Zone: Blizzards, Floods, & Hurricanes: Blame Global Warming."
<p>
Senior Writer Sharon Begley promoted Goddard Institute scientist James Hansen (an early and influential exponent of global warming). The story included a graph claiming, "The average surface temperature of the earth has risen more than 1.5 degrees in the last 135 years."
<p>
Begley noted how some scientists are skeptical, but didn't detail their evidence. Instead, she concluded by endorsing Hansen's theory of immenent climate change, writing "to many people trudging along streets lined with urban Himalayas last week, it already has."
Reporter Bob Dotson fingered the same suspect to explain the weather on the February 2 Dateline NBC: "Despite the cold, last year was the hottest on record. Mix those two extremes, says Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, and stir with global warming." Dotson failed to tell viewers that Oppeheimer is a long-time promoter of warming scenarios for the liberal Environmental Defense Fund. 
<p>
Both got their data from the University of East Anglia, whose climate researchers anointed 1995 the warmest year ever after measuring the Earth's surface temperature for the first 11 months of data, making an "educated guess" about December.
<p>
Oops.
<p>
Reporter Kathy Sawyer in the January 26 Washington Post pointed out "Temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere plummeted in December by almost 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit," a drop "unprecedented in the 17-year satellite record." She cited figures from NOAA, whose satellite data showed that out of 17 years included in their research, "1995 was only about the eighth-warmest year." 
Ronald Bailey, producer of Ben Wattenberg's Think Tank on PBS wrote in the February 5 Weekly Standard that "One climate scientist at NASA speculated that the East Anglia group was afraid that if they waited, December temperatures might plummet and they'd lose their opportunity for a scary headline." Bailey suggested a more accurate headline: "'95 Eighth-Warmest Year on Record."

<h3>Knowledgeable Limbaugh Dittoheads<br>
Not The Media Caricature</h3>
<p>
In his just published book, Hot Talk: All Talk, All the Time, Washington Post media reporter Howard Kurtz argues that talk radio, especially Rush Limbaugh, has a corrosive effect on society as hosts heighten division and spread misinformation. But a new poll by Kurtz' own newspaper found that listening to Limbaugh may be the antidote, not the cause, of public ignorance as his listeners are among the best informed Americans.
<p>
A major Washington Post survey revealed an incredible level of ignorance as 40 percent of the public could not name the Vice President, 47 percent failed to identify the House Speaker, 66 percent had no idea who is U.S. Senate Majority Leader, 94 percent were unable to name the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and 58 percent thought the U.S. spends more on foreign aid than Medicare. 
<p>
But Limbaugh listeners are in a better league. As the Post noted January 29, "They are much more knowledgeable than most about what goes on inside the Beltway and, although they are among the least trusting of the federal government, they are also among the most politically engaged voters." Over 80 percent are registered voters, "compared to only a quarter of non-dittoheads."
<p>
The poll demonstrated just how far off the mark reporters have been. In a January 1995 NBC Nightly News Bob Faw asked whether "talk radio is not democracy in action, but democracy run amok." Writing a Washington Post book review last May former CBS and NBC reporter Marvin Kalb charged: "Cut off the funding for NPR, or gradually reduce its funding to the point where it becomes a mere shadow of its usual robust, sensible self, and the American people may find themselves left with nothing much more than Rush and dozens of his mini-clones for information about the world. For Limbaugh's `dittoheads,' this may be the most splendid of tomorrows, but for other more thoughtful listeners, it may be the bleakest of forecasts." 
<p>
Six in ten Limbaugh listeners "have very little confidence in the news media." Sounds like dittoheads have a better understanding of the media than the media have of them.

<h2><center>Revolving Door from the February 1996 MediaWatch</center></h2>
<p>
<h3>NBC Goes Left with Moyers</h3>
<p>
Three months after the electorate rejected liberal policies, NBC News decided to hire Bill Moyers, a Democratic political activist and left-wing crusader on PBS since leaving CBS News in 1986, to offer commentary on its third place Nightly News. A Deputy Director of the Peace Corps and Press Secretary to President Lyndon Johnson, Moyers began his new duties on February 14, though he will continue his PBS work. NBC has no plans to provide a conservative counter-weight.
<p>
The New York Times relayed February 1 that NBC News President Andy Lack dismissed questions about Moyers' liberal bias at PBS, insisting "that perception is inside the beltway, and perhaps inside about ten blocks of New York and ten blocks of L.A. I don't think the American people give a whit about it." The same day the Baltimore Sun quoted Moyers: "I'm not in politics. I have no agenda. I'm not pushing a platform. I have no ideology."
<p>
Really? In a 1989 Esquire profile Moyers tagged Newt Gingrich "Joe McCarthy with a southern accent." Some other non-ideological quotes:
<p>
From a March 1991 address to the Democratic Issues Conference: "I was raised on mother's milk and Roosevelt speeches, and over the years, I still cherish the party's defining stands." Taking on Democrats from the left, he charged: "By the 1980s, when the Democrats in Congress colluded with Ronald Reagan and the Republicans to revise the tax code on behalf of the rich, it appeared the party had lost its soul."
<p>
In comments during the 1992 PBS press tour: "What liberalism is, is a belief that a democracy like ours has to be tolerant. Has to open itself to ideas, that the answer to a bad idea is a better idea. Civility. I mean, I'd like to think that's what liberalism is. I define myself in that sense as a liberal." On conservatives: "I find it very hard to have intelligent conversations with people on the right wing because they want to hit first and ask questions later. And I just simply don't let that criticism set my agenda." 
<p>
From a September 1991 Washington Post Magazine interview: "The right gets away with blaming liberals for their efforts to help the poor, but what the right is really objecting to is the fact that the poor are primarily black. The man who sits in the White House today [George Bush] opposed the Civil Rights Act. So did Ronald Reagan. This crowd is really fighting a retroactive civil rights war to prevent the people they dislike because of their color from achieving success in American life."
<p>
After Mario Cuomo's 1992 Democratic convention speech, he declared on CNN: "It's worth dying prematurely so you can hear someone else do your eulogy if that someone is Mario Cuomo."
<p>
Following a 1989 PBS re-broadcast of his 1982 CBS Reports: People Like Us, he insisted: "The documentary has held up as both true and sadly prophetic. While Congress restored some of the cuts made in those first Reagan budgets, in the years since, the poor and the working poor have born the brunt of the cost of the Reagan Revolution. The hardest-hit programs have been welfare, housing and other anti-poverty measures. Even programs that were not cut have failed to keep up with inflation. Meanwhile, rich people got big tax breaks. And the middle class kept most of their subsidies intact. As a result, the Reagan years brought on a wider gap between rich and poor."
<p>
In his 1992 PBS show Listening to America, he asked candidate Bill Clinton: "What do you think the American people get for their government? We have no universal health care, we have no federal guarantee of higher education...The regulatory agencies in many cases have been gutted...Why not just say `We will have universal health care and we will raise taxes to pay for it?'"  
Sounds like he'll feel quite comfortable reporting to NBC Nightly News Executive Producer Jeff Gralnick, Press Secretary to then-Senator George McGovern in 1972.

<h3>A Social Problem Blamed on Reaganomics Fades Away in Clinton-Era Media Coverage<br>
The Incredible Shrinking Homeless</h3>
<p>
The poor may have always been with us, but the network news has often presented homelessness as a problem created by the Reagan adminstration. 
<p>
"In the 1980s, the Reagan years, the amount of government money spent to build low-income housing was cut drastically. Then the homeless began to appear on streets and in doorsteps and housing became a visible human problem," proclaimed then-NBC anchor Garrick Utley on November 3, 1990. ABC's John Martin told the same tale in reporting a 1989 homelessness march: "They staged the biggest rally on behalf of the homeless since the Reagan revolution forced severe cutbacks in government housing programs."
<p>
It mattered little that budget experts John Cogan and Timothy Muris noted in The American Enterprise in 1990 that "while budget authority for subsidized housing programs declined 77 percent (from 1981-89), the number of subsidized units and the number of families living in those units increased by one-third." Reporter Harold Dow recycled the same old media spin on the March 26, 1991 CBS Evening News: "In New York there are an estimated 70,000 homeless people, three million across America. A problem that got a lot worse during the boom times of the 1980s."      
<p>
So now that Bill Clinton has been in office for three years, has the ever-growing problem of homelessness continued to burden the White House? Or did the problem recede from the media's agenda? MediaWatch analysts used the MRC Media Tracking System to count the number of network evening news segments on homelessness in America on the four evening newscasts (ABC's World News Tonight, CBS Evening News, NBC Nightly News, and CNN's Prime News or World News). Analysts found the problem faded from the  list of priorities. In the Bush years (1989-1992), the number of homeless stories per year averaged 52.5, but in the first three years of the Clinton administration, the average dropped to 25.3 stories a year.
<p>
During the Bush administration, the story count grew from 44 in 1989 to a peak of 71 in 1990, followed by 54 stories in 1991 and 43 in 1992. By contrast, stories on America's homeless dipped slightly to 35 stories in 1993, and 32 in 1994. In 1995, the number fell dramatically to just nine. When the count is broken down by network, CNN had the widest gap in reporting during the Bush years and Clinton years (90-30), closely followed by ABC (45-16), CBS (41-15), and NBC (36-15).
<p>
But the numbers alone do not tell the whole story. The decline in homeless coverage coincided with the lessening of unsupported statistics about the size of the homeless population. CNN anchor Lou Waters announced on August 8, 1989: "A new research report is warning that homelessness in this country could easily double or triple if there is a mild recession...there now are up to 40 million Americans living on the knife edge of homelessness, just one paycheck, one domestic argument from the streets."
<p>
The willingness to wildly extrapolate the number of America's homeless began to change slightly in 1991, when the Census Bureau's partial count of the homeless in shelters and on the street reported an estimate of 220,000 homeless Americans. All four networks reported on the Census count the night it occurred (March 20, 1990). But when the Census Bureau released its official report announcing a count of 220,000 on April 12, 1991, only CNN reported it. ABC referred to the estimate on May 9, but only to note that congressional sources claimed the estimate was "meaningless."
<p>
While the stories in the Bush era regularly blamed Republican administrations, not one of the 75 homeless stories in the last three years has placed any blame on the Clinton administration. On January 21, 1993, ABC featured a report on the gaudiness of the Clinton inauguration, which reporter Judy Muller concluded: "The Republicans were criticized for their show of wealth in the face of need. The Democrats seemed to have avoided such criticism. Perhaps because President Clinton has promised to help those less fortunate. For now, not many people seem to begrudge Bill Clinton his night on the town, considering the sobering realities he faces the morning after."
<p>
Indeed, in a March 12, 1995 NBC story, reporter Giselle Fernandez warned of the consequences if congressional Republicans succeeded in trimming spending on homeless aid programs in a small $17 billion rescission bill: "Across the nation there are an estimated 20,000 homeless families. And social workers worry the crisis will only worsen if the new Congress keeps its promise and makes deep cuts in bedrock social programs and especially in public housing." Fernandez did not explain why the networks did not blame this problem on the Clinton administration: they announced plans to spend a whopping $2.1 billion in fiscal 1995 on homeless aid, more than three times the $550 million spent in the last year of the Bush administration. To NBC, reducing this dramatic increase was a "deep cut."
<p>
The only story that MediaWatch analysts found on ABC  in 1995 was an anchor brief by Catherine Crier: "A new report today from the advocacy group Children's Defense Fund finds life for millions of American children still filled with poverty and violence. In its new yearbook, the group cites Census Bureau figures showing nearly 16 million children living in poverty last year, the highest level since 1964, and among the homeless, one in four is a child." In other words, the liberal group that used to be chaired by Hillary Clinton has noted that child poverty by one measure is the worst in thirty years, but ABC never wondered whether the Clinton administration could be at fault. 
<p>
The network trend of slowly dropping the story of homelessness, and quickly transforming the issue from an indicator of Republican economic failure to a nonpartisan social problem, suggests that politics more than journalism is at play. Homelessness served as a negative campaign tool against the Republican intention to curb the unending growth of federal spending on social programs.

<P>
<H3>CBS Reporter Smears Pat Buchanan by Connecting Him to the Ku Klux Klan<BR>
-- McNamara Tries Guilt by Association </H3>
<P>
After newscasts highlighted the story of Larry Pratt, the Pat 
Buchanan campaign co-chairman who resigned to combat the discovery 
that he spoke in a number of forums where racists and other bigots 
appeared, liberal Boston Globe columnist Tom Oliphant loaded his 
February 20 column with friendly fire: "For liberals to be silent 
simply because this filth is being directed at a creature of the 
Right who happens to be on a political roll is intolerable." 
If the networks wished to investigate the charge of bigotry against 
Buchanan, they had a library of columns and an archive of video 
clips to spend weeks hunting through for examples. Instead of doing 
the hard work of combing the minutiae of his paper (and TV) trail, 
the networks decided to practice guilt by association, suggesting 
his campaign appeal is too indiscriminate, too likely to appeal to 
bigots. 
<P>
In a February 23 Nightline, ABC's Ted Koppel refined the issue: 
"It's not that Pat Buchanan today is associated with overtly 
anti-Semitic or racist acts or statements, but rather that he has 
created an image of someone who might be sympathetic to such acts 
or statements by others." Koppel not only suggested Buchanan's 
father was a regular listener to the anti-Semitic radio show of 
Father Coughlin (he later apologized when the family denied this), 
he even stooped to accusing Buchanan's little brothers of having 
beaten up Jewish kids in the 1950s.  This is odd coming from 
Koppel, who said of Bill Clinton's 1969 draft-dodging thank-you 
letter: "If we were electing that 23-year-old man, what he said and 
thought and felt at that time would be germane."  
<P> 
Koppel ended his show with a pro-Buchanan letter from Russian 
nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky charging Israel controls America's 
finances "through American Jews or Negroes." Koppel concluded: 
"It's not that Buchanan hasn't expressed some of the views that 
Zhirinovsky echoed, but perhaps he'd never realized how ugly they 
sounded until he heard them in the mouth of a genuine bigot." 
For a desperate search for damaging Buchanan allies, the other 
networks could not match CBS. For finding Buchanan guilty by 
association with people he's either repudiated or never heard of, 
CBS reporter Bob McNamara won the March Janet Cooke Award.  
On the February 28 Evening News, Dan Rather began the story: "For 
his part, Buchanan vowed to come back big in the next phase of 
primaries and immediately, quote, `lit into' Forbes during a 
southern campaign swing today, lit into Forbes as too liberal. At 
the same time, Buchanan is trying to deflect criticism that he is 
an extremist, who, at the very least, uses code words to attract 
voters with racist, bigoted views. Buchanan flatly denies this. 
Correspondent Bob Mc- Namara has been looking into it." 
 <P>
McNamara moved quickly to the issue of Buchanan's fans: "They were 
waiting 3,000 strong for Pat Buchanan outside Atlanta last night. 
They say they've been waiting for years... Here, his call to take 
back the country is a crowd pleaser. But outside the campaign, 
critics charge that Buchanan's rhetoric is making this race about 
race. And the man and his ideas are now beginning to be judged by 
the company they keep." 
<P> 
McNamara explained: "Lurking in the shadows of last month's 
Louisiana campaign, there was former Klan leader David Duke." Duke 
told CBS: "I let the word out to all my supporters in the state 
that I supported Patrick Buchanan, and if Patrick goes on to win 
the nomination, I guess part of the credit will have to go to us."  
McNamara  allowed a perfunctory rebuttal: "It is not an endorsement 
Buchanan wants, and today his backers took pains to distance their 
man from charges of extremism on economics and immigration, race, 
and religion." CBS aired Buchanan backer Rabbi Aryeh Spero: "This 
is a guilt by association, which is very dangerous to our whole 
political system." 
<P>
Focusing on racism, McNamara countered: "Today, even in the New 
South, old ideas have not been completely laid to rest. And for 
people uncomfortable with the way the world has changed, Buchanan's 
message is hitting home....Danny Carver is a roofing contractor, a 
Christian, and a lifetime member of the Ku Klux Klan. He says he 
and Buchanan speak the same language." Carver told McNamara: "About 
everything he says we agree with....When he's talking about 
affirmative action he has to be talking about women and niggers, I 
guess." McNamara asked: "Do you think Buchanan would want to hear 
that you support him?" Carver replied: "He would want to hear it, 
but he don't want it on TV." 
<P>
CBS didn't explain how Carver came to their attention. He's not an 
unknown, but a self-promoting semi-regular on Howard Stern's 
syndicated radio show. Stern, who's Jewish and calls Carver a 
"lunatic," has featured him as the butt of humor on his Butt Bongo 
Fiesta video (where he struck out in the game "Guess Who's the 
Jew"), and as a judge of the topless "Miss Howard Stern" contest in  
a 1993 New Year's Eve pay-per-view special. 
<P>
McNamara concluded: "The Buchanan campaign said tonight that it 
adamantly rejects all forms of racism as immoral, saying that their 
campaign is, quote, `populated by people who embrace the sense of 
justice in the Old and New Testament.' But he has become a 
candidate battling a political Catch-22. A man who says what he 
means and means what he says and now must fight the embrace of 
people who think they know exactly what he is talking about." CBS 
News spokeswoman Kim Apgar told MediaWatch "I can't speak to this. 
You need McNamara." But CBS could not locate a number where 
McNamara could be reached. 
<P>
While CBS attempted to connect Buchanan with neo-Nazis and the KKK, 
they have been critical of any look at the associations of Bill 
Clinton. In October 1992, The Washington Times and others 
investigated Clinton's role in the anti-Vietnam war movement. 
Father Richard McSorley's book Peace Eyes recounts Clinton's role 
as an organizer of a protest service that ended in a march to the 
U.S. embassy with white crosses, left "as an indication of our 
desire to end the agony of Vietnam." McSorley reported the 
protest's organizers were "Group 68 (Americans in Britain)," which 
"had the support" of the British Peace Council, a Soviet front 
group.  
<P>
After Clinton's anti-war involvement came up in the first 
presidential debate, CBS This Morning co-host Harry Smith declared 
on October 12: "Clearly, that red-baiting junk didn't work last 
night." The networks aired no stories questioning "the company 
Clinton keeps" or suggesting "It's not that Clinton has signaled 
through acts or statements his support for the Soviet Union, but 
that he created an image of someone who might be sympathetic to 
such acts or statements." They called it a smear. Guilt by 
association is clearly a game reporters play on only one side.

<H3>Jack White, Smear Artist.</H3>
<P>
In an attack uglier than any of this year's attack ads, Time
national correspondent Jack E. White announced the culprits behind
black church burnings in the South. After blaming Pat Buchanan's
"ugly rhetoric" in the March 18 issue, he broadened the smear: "In
fact, all the conservative Republicans, from Newt Gingrich to Pete
Wilson, who have sought political advantage by exploiting white
resentment should come and stand in the charred ruins of the New
Liberty Baptist Church in Tyler [Alabama]...and wonder if their
coded phrases encouraged the arsonists. Over the past 18 months,
while Republicans fulminated about welfare and affirmative action,
more than 20 churches in Alabama and six other Southern and Border
states have been torched."
<P>
White noted the current lack of evidence of a racist conspiracy in
the bombings, yet concluded: "But there is already enough evidence
to indict the cynical conservatives who build their political
careers, George Wallace-style, on a foundation of race-baiting.
They may not start fires, but they fan the flames." 
<P>
<a name=rooting>
<H3>Rooting Against Rush.</H3>
<P>
Tom Brokaw may have engaged in wishful thinking on the February 14
Nightly News when he devoted the "NBC News Online" to the alleged
fall of Rush Limbaugh. Brokaw claimed "Election results are one way
to tell who's hot in politics. Then there are the ratings in this
business." Brokaw charged that Limbaugh's "radio and television
ratings have tumbled, and his books, once huge best-sellers, now
are in the discount bins." He added a plug for the book Rush
Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot by Al Franken, a fellow NBC employee:
"And a book about Limbaugh, by the comedian Al Franken, is riding
high, it's number two behind Hillary Clinton's book and rising
fast."
<P>
But as Talkers magazine Editor Michael Harrison noted in the March
3 Washington Times, Limbaugh's ratings "dropped a marginal,
insignificant amount" in the fall. "The guy belches in ratings, and
everyone runs around as if the witch is dead," Harrison said. He
noted Limbaugh is on 650 radio stations, with a total audience more
than double his closest political talk show competition. 
<P>
Linda Cecere of the Rush Limbaugh television show told MediaWatch
there are 8.9 million copies of Limbaugh's two books currently in
print, and noted the books have spent a total of 114 weeks on the
New York Times bestseller list (hardcover and paperback). His first
book spent 24 weeks at the #1 spot. Brokaw ignored how virtually
all bestsellers with a big press run are eventually discounted.
<P>
<a name=friends>
<H3>With Friends Like These.... </H3>
<P>
During the usually contentious primary season the media focused on
Republican rifts, but ignored Democratic divisions over their party
leader. With two exceptions the networks failed to report attacks
on President Clinton from two prominent Democrats. In an interview
with Washington Post reporter Martha Sherrill in the January issue
of Esquire magazine Senator Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.) insisted:
"Clinton's an unusually good liar." Kerrey's extraordinary
admission received very little coverage. Tim Russert, prompted by
a Washington Times article, asked Colorado Gov. Roy Romer about the
Kerrey quote on the February 4 Meet the Press.
<P>
CNN's Bernard Shaw briefly mentioned the quote on the February 6
Inside Politics, and added the remarks of Sen. Ernest Hollings
(D-S.C.) who joked of Clinton's poll ratings: "If they get up to 60
percent, his people tell me Bill can start dating again." Shaw also
relayed a Hollings quote from a South Carolina paper: "Clinton's as
popular as AIDS in South Carolina." The Hollings quotes received no
coverage in the usually AIDS-sensitive television networks of ABC,
NBC and CBS. By contrast, in December 1994 when Senator Jesse Helms
(R-N.C.) joked that Clinton was so unpopular that he had better
bring bodyguards if he visited any military bases, the Helms remark
generated nine stories on the three broadcast network evening news
shows.

<H3>Our Sweet Little Terrorist Helper</H3>
<P>
In the weeks following the Oklahoma City bombing, the news media
were quick to portray suspect Timothy McVeigh unsympathetically as
a violent extremist, as well they should. But when 26-year-old Lori
Berenson was sentenced to life in prison by a Peruvian military
tribunal for being closely involved with the Marxist terrorists of
the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA), the news media tried
to portray her sympathetically as a concerned American who went to
Latin America to work for the poor. 
<P>
Although she admitted to being affiliated with the MRTA, the
January 22 Time didn't feel that was important: "Her friends and
relatives know Lori Berenson as a compassionate idealist, an
innocent waylaid by her concern for the poor and oppressed of Latin
America." Time concluded: "But Berenson's real passion was always
to help the downtrodden; as a teenager she donated time to a soup
kitchen." A February 4 Washington Post headline read: "Little Girl
Lost. American Lori Berenson, 26, Was a Good Daughter, A Good
Worker, a Good-Hearted Person. In Peru, She Got Into Trouble. Bad
Trouble." On February 21, ABC Prime Time Live reporter John
Quinones used the same approach in a story titled "To Love A
Country": "In the 8th grade, Lori volunteered to work at a soup
kitchen. Later that year she was selected to narrate a commercial
for CARE, an appeal to feed needy children."
<P>
This theme was countered by a Mark Falcoff article in the February
26 issue of The Weekly Standard: "But let the record show that she
is charged not for her views, but for her involvement with a
terrorist group that, in recent years, has been involved in
assassinations, bombings, kidnappings, robberies, and attacks
against innocent people, many of them poor."
<P>
<a name=absentees>
<H3>Ethics Absentees</H3>
<P>
The networks continue to ignore ethics complaints against
Democratic leaders of the House of Representatives. In early
February, the networks saw no need for a story when Rep. Jennifer
Dunn (R-Wash.) filed a complaint with the House ethics committee
suggesting House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt may have evaded
capital gains taxes on a land swap.  
<P>
The February 23 Washington Times reported that Gephardt dumped his
share of ownership of the vacation home on North Carolina's Outer
Banks. George Archibald wrote that Gephardt, who is an avid
opponent of capital gains tax cuts, "claimed for
financial-disclosure purposes that his condo was not a rental
property the year he sold it for $183,000. He simultaneously
claimed it as a rental property for tax purposes to escape capital
gains taxes of about $17,000 in 1991." Archibald struck again with
a March 6 piece in the Washington Times noting that Rep. Bob Barr
(R-Ga.) formally requested the Justice Department undertake a
criminal probe of Gephardt's tax situation. Neither story piqued
the networks' curiosity.
<P>
On March 6, the conservative Landmark Legal Foundation filed a
complaint against House MinorityWhip David Bonior, the ethical
scold of Speaker Newt Gingrich, for misusing his congressional
staff to write a 1984 book on government time. The networks didn't
cover that either.

"This morning we're taking a close look at the problem of child
care, a problem some countries are solving," co-host Harry Smith
announced on the February 21 CBS This Morning. The country with the
solution? France and its expensive, old-style socialist system. 
<P>
Smith marveled at the state-mandated benefits: "Like all new
mothers in France, Helene took a 16-week paid maternity leave from
her job. In addition, mothers who work for larger companies can
take off two more years unpaid, with the guarantee their jobs will
still be there when they get back." To support this system, Smith
admitted that taxes are "much higher in France than in the United
States...and that may be why they're going through some of their
own economic problems." But, incredibly, he also referred to the
system as free: "When Jeanne leaves day care, she can attend a
completely free, good quality, state-run pre-school where she stays
until she is six and primary school begins."  Smith followed the
segment with an interview of Ellen Galinsky of the liberal Families
and Work Institute. His first question was more accusation: "In the
United States, are we just not willing to pay for child care?"
<P>
<a name=first>
<H3>ABC vs. the First Amendment</H3>
<P>
A special interest group wants to use the coercive power of the
government to silence the opposition. ABC News naturally comes down
on the side of free speech, right? Not quite. Here's how Peter
Jennings introduced a February 14 World News Tonight story:
"Supporters of gun control, who had no success convincing a
Republican Congress to pass stronger gun control legislation, have
adopted a new tactic. They have asked the Federal Trade Commission
to stop certain advertisements by gun manufacturers."
<P>
Lisa Stark explained that the ads "sell safety and security,
offering guns as a way to protect loved ones, to guard home and
family. But critics say this picture is deceptive and misleading."
After a soundbite from Sarah Brady, Stark elaborated: "Gun control
advocates point to tragedies you won't find in the ads. In Texas,
a teenager shot and killed, mistaken for a burglar by her father;
in California, a four-year-old shoots himself," and a 15-year-old
"killed by his best friend." 
<P>
Stark asserted that "scientific studies show handguns are more
likely to hurt family members than protect them." ABC aired three
soundbites from opponents of the gun ads, but only one from Tanya
Metaksa of the National Rifle Association. Metaksa was only allowed
to defend the right to air ads, not to counter the liberal
statistics about gun accidents. If Stark had any interest in
balance, she could have noted that Dr. Arthur Kellerman, a fervent
gun control advocate, explained in the August 14, 1994 U.S. News &
World Report that "Studies such as ours do not include cases in
which intruders are wounded or frightened away by the use or
display of a firearm." Last year in his book Guns, David Kopel
noted that bicycle and swimming pool accidents kill more children
annually than do guns. If ABC wants the FTC to regulate
advertisements from weapon manufacturers, then who will regulate
the network's own gun control ads disguised as journalism?
<P>
<a name=episcopal>
<H3>The Episcopalian Inquisition?</H3>
<P>
The word inquisition brings to mind torture sessions in dark
castles in medieval Europe where unbelievers were strapped to the
rack until they swore allegiance to the church. Recently, the
networks used the word to describe whether the Episcopal Church
should allow a practicing homosexual minister to lead church
services.
<P>
Peter Jennings led off the rhetorical overkill about Bishop Walter
Righter on the February 27 World News Tonight: "This next story in
the news tonight may conjure the Spanish Inquisition for some but
the dateline is Wilmington, Delaware. A retired bishop could become
the second Episcopal priest in the two hundred year history of the
U.S. Episcopal Church to be tried for heresy, the most serious
breach of Christian faith. His offense: ordaining a practicing
homosexual five years ago."
<P>
On the same night's CBS Evening News, reporter Richard Threlkeld
referred to the trial as something "right out of the middle ages"
and stated that "critics charge Bishop Righter's the victim of a
conservative inquisition." The idea that conservative bishops
inside the Episcopal Church wanted to enforce church doctrine left
Threlkeld scratching his head: "It's ironic that something so
medieval should be happening within the Episcopal Church, one of
the more tolerant of Protestant denominations."

<P>
<H3>Networks Ignore Clinton Ally's Coalition-Building with Louis Farrakhan<BR>
--Reserving Rebukes for Buchanan</H3>
<P>
When the liberal Center for Public Integrity released a report
February 15 showing Larry Pratt, co-chairman of the Pat Buchanan
campaign, had attended and spoken before meetings of white
supremacists and anti-semites, it led all the network evening
newscasts. Some made Buchanan guilty by association. "Pat Buchanan
was caught today in his own crossfire with accusations that he is
running a campaign of hate and bigotry," declared Phil Jones on
CBS. 
<P>
But five days later, when Bill Clinton and Al Gore attended the
swearing in of Kweisi Mfume as President of the NAACP, the networks
refused to make an issue of Mfume's links to the Nation of Islam's
Louis Farrakhan. The four network evening shows didn't even mention
the event.
<P>
As New York Post editorial page editor Eric Breindel pointed out
February 29, Mfume "helped forge the 1993 `Sacred Covenant' between
the Congressional Black Caucus, which Mfume chaired, and Louis
Farrakhan's Nation of Islam." Surely, asked Breindel, "the
fringe-right groups with which Larry Pratt associates are no more
pernicious than the Farrakhanites." 
<P>
Pratt, head of Gun Owners of America, immediately took a leave of
absence from the Buchanan campaign. "Mfume, by contrast," Breindel
noted, "hasn't manifested any inclination to distance himself from
Farrakhan....the ex-Congressman hasn't even been asked to do so."
Not even after Farrakhan praised the leaders of Libya, Iraq and
Iran during a world trip. Farrakhan accepted a $1 billion pledge
from Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi for his separatist
organization to "mobilize `oppressed' minorities to influence this
year's U.S. elections," The Washington Post reported February 17,
three days before Clinton stood beside Mfume.  
<P>
Back in the U.S., Farrakhan offered some fresh anti-semitism. In a
clip shown February 29 on Rush Limbaugh, he said: "When you bring
me before Congress, I'm going to call the roll of all the
Congressmen who are honorary members of the Israeli Knesset and get
contributions from the Zionist AIPAC, and then I want you to
register as a foreign power! Every year you give Israel $46 billion
of the taxpayers' money and you haven't asked the taxpayers one
damn thing. Who are you an agent of?"
<P>
Did reporters demand Clinton explain his support of Farrakhan
backer Mfume? No, they were too busy tarnishing Buchanan. In a
February 23 NBC Nightly News piece, Gwen Ifill proffered to
Buchanan: "People say that you are a sexist, a racist, an
anti-semite." Ifill concluded that "Buchanan fancies himself a
trench-fight-er, a warrior for a new conservatism of the heart. But
increasingly he's being judged by the company he keeps." That's not
a judgment reporters made of Clinton.

The Congress may have failed so far to pass a regulatory reform
bill, but The Washington Post is warning of the consequences of
"deregulation" nonetheless. In a four-part February 18-21 series
titled "De Facto Deregulation," Post reporters didn't so much
describe "deregulation" as they did the frustration of regulators
and their political allies at their inability to implement
additional rules.
<P>
In the first story, reporter Cindy Skrzycki did feature opinions
from the "libertarian" Cato Institute and the "conservative"
National Center for Public Policy Research, but leftist Ralph Nader
was simply a "consumer activist." Despite their prominence in  the
series, liberal groups like the Natural Resources Defense Council
(NRDC) were not described as liberal.
<P>
Stephen Barr's story on the Occupational Safety and Health
Administration (OSHA) read like a bureaucrat's newsletter,
beginning with the headline "Cuts Frustrate OSHA Plans to Improve
Worker Safety." Barr mourned the agency's 15 percent budget
reduction and trotted out the OSHA line that it has far too few
inspectors to enforce its regulations in every business across the
nation. Barr passed on OSHA complaints that it hasn't enough money
for its office redesign plans and computer networking operations.
Barr added that its employees "likely will lose part of their
salaries through unpaid furlough days....The possibility of layoffs
has flattened morale at OSHA and left many OSHA employees feeling
anxious about their futures." 
<P>
Barr didn't address the philosophical point of new congressional
oversight -- that for decades, regulatory agencies had no check or
balance in the legislative branch -- or the obvious counterpoint
that OSHA's actions have often caused economic frustrations and
anxieties to businesses.
<P>
In the last article of the series, reporter Gary Lee mourned the
failure to implement new revisions from the 1990 Clean Air Act
reauthorization. As David Hawkins of the NRDC complained in the
series' last paragraph: "We'll never be able to get clean air in
areas like [Baltimore or Houston] without stricter enforcement of
the act." Apparently to the Post, "deregulation" doesn't mean the
repeal of regulations, but merely slowing down the juggernaut of
ever-increasing government interference.

<H3>CBS Spikes Goldberg for His Honesty--Blew the Wrong Whistle</H3>
<P>
What a difference the message makes. After 60 Minutes last fall
spiked part of an interview with Jeffrey Wigand, the ex-Brown &
Williamson cigarette company executive, CBS reporters were angry
and embarrassed that Wigand's confidentiality pledge prevented him
from blowing the whistle on his former employer. On February 4, CBS
overcame the legal hurdle and aired the spiked charges about
manipulated nicotine levels. On PBS's Charlie Rose February 6 Dan
Rather said that story "was gutsy, great reporting."
<P>
Fast forward a week and CBS correspondent Bernard Goldberg blew the
whistle on CBS, detailing in a February 13 Wall Street Journal
op-ed how colleague Eric Engberg's story on the flat tax "set new
standards for bias." Goldberg explained that "The old argument that
the networks and other `media elites' have a liberal bias is so
blatantly true that it's hardly worth discussing anymore."
<P>
So did journalists trumpet this whistle-blower? Hardly. "It's such
a wacky charge....I don't know what Bernie was driving at. It just
sounds bizarre," Face the Nation's Bob Schieffer told The
Washington Post. "To accuse Eric of liberal bias is absurd,"
sniffed CBS News President Andrew Heyward. "The test is not the
names people call you or accusations by political activists inside
or outside your own organization," Rather told the New York Post in
an insult to Goldberg's professionalism, insisting "I am not going
to be cowed by anybody's special political agenda."
<P>
USA Today's Peter Johnson reported March 11: "Some colleagues
supported him privately. But many others stopped talking to him,
dismissing him as dead wrong, an ingrate, a nut or all of the
above. Mostly, the big chill set in. Not-so-coincidentally, none of
his commentary segments on the News, `Bernard Goldberg's America,'
has aired since the day his piece came out."
<P>
Johnson concluded that CBS has decided to bully the messenger:
"Goldberg has spent the past month lying low, hoping animus toward
him would die down. It hasn't, and all signs around CBS News are
that it will continue until Goldberg shows interest in eating a
healthy serving of humble pie." 
<P>
The March 13 New York Post reported that Goldberg apologized to
Engberg and is sorry if he "hurt anyone's feelings." But Goldberg
felt he had to go public since, as he explained to the Post's Josef
Adalian, he "tried for years and years to discuss this issue," but
was "met with varying degrees of `Who cares?'"

Two network veterans have joined the effort to re-elect President 
Clinton. In the Clinton-Gore campaign office, Roll Call reported that 
Joseph Lockhart, who bounces between Democratic presidential campaigns 
and network slots, has bounced again, this time into the national press 
secretary slot. Lockhart was an assistant press secretary to Democratic 
candidate Walter Mondale in 1984, then Press Secretary to Senator Paul 
Simon until becoming assignment editor for ABC News in Chicago in 1985. 
He put in a stint as a deputy assignment editor at CNN before joining 
the 1988 Dukakis-Bentsen campaign as a traveling press aide.
Stuart Schear, the off-air health and science reporter until last year 
for the MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour, has joined the White House press office 
as coordinator of local and national TV interviews with the President, 
The Washington Post reported. For the July/August 1995 Mother Jones, 
Schear wrote "a consumer guide to the health insurer's new, overheated 
advertising campaigns."
<P>
<H3>Politics in All News</H3>
<P>
ABC and Fox have chosen political operatives to head their future 
all-news cable channels. ABC News President Roone Arledge went left, 
hiring back former ABC News executive Jeff Gralnick from NBC News where 
he's been Executive Producer of the NBC Nightly News since 1993. In 1971 
Gralnick served as Press Secretary to liberal Senator George McGovern 
(D-S.D.). After promoting the future presidential candidate, Gralnick 
jumped to ABC, where by 1979 he had risen to Executive Producer of World 
News Tonight. He oversaw all election coverage for ABC since 1980, 
becoming Vice President and Executive Producer of special events in 
1985.
<P>
Fox Chairman Rupert Murdoch went to the right, naming Roger Ailes, 
President of CNBC since 1993, as the chief executive of the Fox All News 
Network as well as of the Fox broadcast news operation. While  producer 
of the Mike Douglas Show in the 1960s, Ailes met Richard Nixon and left 
the show to become media adviser to the 1968 Republican candidate's 
successful run. He spent the next two decades devising media and ad 
strategies for GOP candidates, including Ronald Reagan and George Bush. 
In 1992 he took the helm of the Rush Limbaugh TV show as its Executive 
Producer.

Six media veterans are making out pretty well at the White House, a June 
26, 1995 payroll report shows. The March 1 Washington Times ran the list 
of salaries of 407 White House staffers released by the Senate 
Appropriations Committee's subcommittee on the Treasury, Postal Service 
and general government.
<P>
The list shows that speechwriting head Donald Baer, a former U.S. News 
Assistant Managing Editor, earns $125,000 a year. Wall Street Journal 
and Time reporter turned speechwriter Daniel Benjamin gets $80,000, as 
do speechwriters Carolyn Curiel, a former Nightline producer, and Alison 
Muscatine, a former Washington Post reporter who also helped write First 
Lady Hillary Clinton's book It Takes a Village. Deputy Press Secretary 
Virginia Terzano, a CBS News election unit researcher in 1988, pulls 
down $66,000. At the bottom end lies Anne Edwards at $50,000, a former 
CBS News assignment editor and Senior Editor for NPR who now runs the

through late 1994. For the past year she's been Deputy to the

Lard on the Labels, Investigate Finances, and Charge Bigotry<BR>

Reporters don't like ideological labeling, at least when it's
applied to them. Last November, Dan Rather told Denver radio host
Mike Rosen he hated "to be tagged by someone else's label. I try
really hard not to do that with other people, particularly people
who are in public service and politics."
<P>
So do reporters use labeling in campaign coverage? MediaWatch
analysts compared media coverage of the primaries in 1992 with
those in 1996. Analysts reviewed evening news coverage of the four
networks (ABC's World News Tonight, CBS Evening News, NBC Nightly
News, and CNN's The World Today and in 1992 World News or Prime
News) for 19 days, starting with the Tuesday before the New
Hampshire primary.
<P>
For 1992, the days studied were February 11-29; in 1996, February
13-March 2, the day of the South Carolina primary. Both were 
periods when voters and reporters winnowed down the presidential
field.
<P>
The study found the Democratic candidates or their supporters were
labeled "liberal" only four times, none suggesting extremism. In
1996, GOP candidates or their supporters were labeled 73 times, 45
of the labels suggesting extremism. Analysts also looked at
campaign controveries. Five stories investigated the finances of
Republicans, compared to no investigations of the Democrats.
Charges of bigotry by  Pat Buchanan were featured in 20 stories.  
<P>
<a name=labels>
<H3>Labels.</H3>
<P>
Reporters used only four liberal labels to describe the Democratic
candidates, all in the first two days of the 1992 study period. On
February 11, NBC's Andrea Mitchell used two labels, calling Tom
Harkin "a pure liberal and proud of it" with "old-fashioned liberal
solutions." That same night, ABC's Judy Muller noted: "If Kerrey's
health plan strikes some voters as too liberal, his more
conservative proposals for dealing with the recession seem to
strike a chord with voters trying to make ends meet." The next
night, Muller said Harkin calls himself "an unabashed liberal." 
<P>
Even when the ideology seemed obvious, reporters stressed
candidates were not liberal, but part of the mainstream. On
February 12, 1992, ABC reporter Chris Bury reported on Jerry Brown:
"To those who hear him, Brown's appeal is his idealism, his calls
for political reform, universal health care, and environmental
activism." Despite that left-wing agenda, Bury underlined: "Some
voters seemed surprised Brown did not sound so radical." The
closest thing to a Clinton label came from ABC's Jack Smith, who
told viewers a week later that Clinton's economic message "runs
counter to so much traditional liberal ideology." (Did reporters
eschew labeling in 1992? No. Stories during the study period on the
1992 GOP race used the word "conservative" or "from the right" on
77 occasions, with four references to extremism.) 
<P>
In 1996, Republicans and their voters were labeled on 73 occasions.
The networks employed 18 conservative descriptions, six moderate
labels, and even four liberal tags (all of them from  reporters
quoting Buchanan's attacks on his rivals). On the 18th, NBC's David
Bloom said Lamar Alexander was "trying to bolster his conservative
credentials." But extreme terms were applied on 45 occasions -- all
but one to describe Pat Buchanan. (The exception: Bloom called 
Alexander a "moderate Republican with a radical plan of
devolution.") Among references to extremism, 36 used the terms
"extreme" or "extremist," but analysts included the terms
"ultraconservative," "too conservative" or "out of the mainstream."
<P>
CBS led the networks with 19 references to Buchanan's extremism
(compared to 12 for CNN, nine for ABC, and five by NBC). On six
occasions, CBS underlined their perception of Buchanan's
ultraconservatism by referring to the networks' Voter News Service
exit poll question asking if Buchanan was too extreme. In a
February 18 interview with Sen. Phil Gramm, Dan Rather asked:
"There is a perception that Buchanan has around him people with
extremist views on race. Do you agree?" On February 25, CBS weekend
anchor John Roberts asked CBS consultant Joe Klein: "Some call
Buchanan an extremist. Others call him as American as apple pie.
What is this fellow's appeal?" Klein replied: "He is both. He is an
extremist and as American as apple pie." 
<P>
<a name=finances>
<H3>Finances.</H3>
<P>
Reporters were not interested in the Democratic candidates'
finances in 1992, airing no stories during the study period. When
Whitewater first came to light on March 8, 1992, NBC aired only one
story, eight days later. CBS made a brief mention on the 8th, and
then dismissed financial questions on the 16th. Reporter Richard
Threlkeld portrayed Whitewater questions as an invasion of Hillary
Clinton's privacy.  All together, the networks did just five full
stories on the Clinton finances in 1992.
<P>
In 1996, CBS and NBC combined for five stories in just 19 days
touching on Republican candidate finances. NBC investigated the
sweetheart deals of Lamar Alexander on February 13, and mentioned
them again February 18. CBS investigated the Alexander deals on
February 15, then added another look at Honey Alexander's and
Elizabeth Dole's financial moves on February 17. On March 2, CBS
suggested hypocrisy in Buchanan's stock ownership of Fortune 500
corporations. On February 21, CBS reporter Rita Braver claimed
Lamar Alexander had "some financial dealings in his past that might
put Whitewater to shame."
<P>
<a name=bigotry>
<H3>Bigotry?</H3>
<P>
Sparked by the disclosure that Buchanan campaign co-chair Larry
Pratt spoke at forums shared by white supremacists, the networks
aired twenty stories raising the allegation that Buchanan was
bigoted against blacks or Jews. CBS reporter Phil Jones concluded:
"Buchanan has been talking and writing like this for years. Then,
he was on the fringe. Now, he's on the front line and Americans are
starting to take a closer look at Pat Buchanan's America." The
story count didn't include isolated soundbites, like one voter on
the March 2 CBS Evening News: "Buchanan scares me. He reminds me of
a little guy over in Germany with a mustache." 
<P>
In September 1992, Bill Clinton claimed: "Nobody's had a tougher
press than I have. No candidate in history has." Some of this
year's candidates may beg to differ.

<Center><h2>
Bright Side for April 1996 Mediawatch
</h2></center>


<b>Detecting Deception</b><br>

CNN's Brooks Jackson was first out of the gate to critique the presidential candidates in their ads and speeches. On the April 1 Inside Politics he critiqued Republican charges that Clinton judges were soft on crime. But in a surprising turn Jackson has also slammed Clinton's newest set of ads. His April 4 "Spin Patrol" segment challenged each claim made in the Democratic National Committee ads.
<p>
CNN aired the ad: "The President proposes a balanced budget protecting Medicare, education, the environment. But Dole is voting no. The President cuts taxes for 40 million Americans. Dole votes no." 
<p>
Jackson replied: "Dole voting no to a balanced budget and tax cuts? Let's see that again...True, Clinton's latest budget would balance in 7 years on paper, but experts are skeptical." Jackson used moderate-to-liberal Carol Cox Wait of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget and Robert Reischauer of the Brookings Institution.
<p>
Jackson found the ad's claim "The President cuts taxes for 40 million Americans" was "Not the whole story." He pointed out that the Clinton administration arrived at the 40 million number through the 1993 budget bill's expansion of the earned income tax credit to "15 million low wage families, 40 million if you count their children." Jackson countered they also raised taxes on 1.5 million high-income families and 5 million Social Security recipients, not to mention higher gas taxes for everyone.
<p>
Another ad claimed Republicans cut school lunches. Jackson: "Not so. The Republican Congress appropriated more money for school lunches this year....And the Agriculture Department says it has increased the number of children served." 
<p>
The same ad charged the GOP cut Head Start: "Money for the Head Start pre-school program has been cut four percent this year, temporarily. But Republican leaders have agreed to a one percent increase once a permanent appropriations bill is passed. Meanwhile not a single child has been affected. In fact Head Start enrollment is up this year."  
<p>
And the DNC's claim that Republicans "cut child health care" did not go unchallenged. Jackson explained that Republicans only reduced the rate of Medicaid growth and that there is not much difference between the GOP and Clinton's proposal.

<title>Janet Cooke Award April 1996</title>

<center><h2>
Janet Cooke Award for the April 1996 Mediawatch. 
</h2></center>

<i>The Janet Cooke Award is given to the most outrageously distorted news story of the month. The award honors the Washington Post reporter who won the Pulitzer Prize for a story later proven completely false.</i>
<p>

<b>
CBS, NBC Suggest "Extremist" Bishop Guilty of "Witch Hunt" for Upholding Church Teaching.
</b><br>
In the sophisticated ambiance of TV newsrooms, freedom of association is a concept apparently as outmoded as traditional religion. The notion that in America, a church is a voluntary association, bound together by commonly held theological beliefs, is a strange and alien argument. For holding up a Catholic bishop as a symbol of "extremism" enforcing a "blacklist," CBS and NBC earned the Janet Cooke Award. 
<p>
On the March 25 CBS Evening News, Dan Rather began: "In Lincoln, Nebraska, a bishop is taking the Catholic Church's battle over personal morality a step further. He is threatening to excommunicate any parishioner who joins groups advocating positions the church opposes. That threat puts this bishop in the forefront of a national furor, as we hear from Scott Pelley."
<p>
Pelley began: "Critics call him an extremist, a danger to the Catholic Church. What has thrust national notoriety upon Bishop Fabian Bruskewitz is a list, his own blacklist of organizations, he says, threaten the mortal soul...Bruskewitz has decreed that parishioners in his diocese of southern Nebraska have seven weeks to resign memberships in the listed groups, or be excommunicated, severing, the bishop says, their relationship with God."
<p>
He added: "The list includes pro-choice Planned Parenthood and the Hemlock Society, which advocates a right to die. But it also includes some organizations that consider themselves to be Catholic, even though they stray from Vatican teaching. One of them, known as Call to Action, advocates the ordination of women."
<p>
Call to Action's Robert McClory claimed: "The organization was founded to promote dialogue on issues, about which Catholics are seriously divided. He would prefer, evidently, that there be no discussion, and he's ordered those people, who think so, to simply get out of his house." Pelley noted: "The Bruskewitz list may be unique in America. Bishops rule their own diocese; parishioners are welcome to appeal to the Pope. Randall Moody faces excommunication. He is a parishioner and a member of Planned Parenthood's [national] board of directors." Moody oozed: "The organizations affected by this excommunication order are mainstream America, and it paints the church into the corner of being an extremist organization."
<p>
Pelley allowed Bruskewitz to speak: "These groups mislead people into thinking that they're compatible with the Catholic religion when they're not....It's not a question of not wanting to discuss issues. It's a question of an organization, which is, by its very constitution, inimical to the Catholic faith, which is destructive of church discipline."
<p>
Pelley ended: "The controversy is an example of tension in the American church, with a conservative Vatican on one side and reform-minded Catholics on the other. Now in Nebraska, there is a deadline for those who must decide whether they live their conscience or keep their faith."
<p>
NBC Nightly News had a similar take on April 1. While the on-screen graphic read "Blacklisted," Tom Brokaw pronounced: "A controversy is splitting apart a church as it prepares to enter its holiest week. At issue: A threat by a Catholic bishop in Nebraska to expel members from the church, for reasons his critics say belong in another era. Here's NBC's Linda Vester."
<p>
Vester began: "Last night in Lincoln, more than 60 Catholics gathered to figure out how to avoid being kicked out of their church...They're angry with the bishop of Lincoln for threatening them with the ultimate punishment: excommunication. Their crime: belonging to any of twelve groups the bishop has blacklisted, including Planned Parenthood, the Freemasons, and Call to Action, a nationwide organization that advocates women priests, married priests, and birth control."
<p>
Bruskewitz said: "Membership in these organizations that are listed certainly imperils the Catholic faith." Vester countered: "But a blanket order of excommunication, for any reason, is rare, unheard of in modern times. Some members of Call to Action, like Rosalyn Carr, are afraid and are quitting the group." Carr charged: "Well, I think the bishop has ways to retaliate."
<p>
Vester added: "But at Call to Action's meeting last night, others were defiant. Those who defy the bishop's order will be excommunicated May 15, which means they can attend mass, but they can't take communion or get  married in the church. The bishop says he won't enforce the order; he expects people to police themselves....But the bishop is getting help. The pro-life group, Rescue America, is going to give him members' names from the local Planned Parenthood."
<p>
Vester asked: "Is it a witch hunt? One theologian thinks it may turn people away from a church already struggling with its image." Father Richard McBride of the University of Notre Dame exclaimed: "It reinforces the prejudice that a lot of people have that it really is a new, a modern form of authoritarianism."
<p>
Vester wrapped it up: "Despite what critics say, Bishop Bruskewitz insists his order stands." Bruskewitz said: "Oh, I have no intentions of waffling." Vester's conclusion was almost identical to Pelley's: "Which leaves some Catholics here feeling forced to choose between their conscience and their church." When contacted by MediaWatch, both reporters were said to be on assignment. Despite numerous calls and faxes, neither responded.
<p>
William Donohue, President of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, told MediaWatch the networks are guilty of "rank hypocrisy" in their coverage of freedom of association: "The American Civil Liberties Union has a policy that every officer is pro-choice. If an officer were to evolve into a pro-life position, he would become a pariah, like Nat Hentoff, who was thrown off the board of directors. That's their prerogative. But where's the charge of authoritarianism?"
<p>
Donohue said the same is true for reporters: "I asked a newspaper reporter: what if one of your colleagues went on the local TV station and denounced your newspaper? If a secular organization won't tolerate that kind of insubordination, why is the Church held to a different standard?" This is especially pertinent in the case of CBS News after reporter Bernard Goldberg was kept off the air for months after he denounced the liberal bias of his own network. A CBS statement said Rather "disagrees with Mr. Goldberg's opinion...and its expression." 
<p>
Perhaps the networks' blind spot is unique to religion, where they imply that dissent is noble and church doctrine autocratic, that theology is subject to a vote and salvation is accomplished by focus group. CBS and NBC had three possible ways to present its story: Bruskewitz as hero for standing up for tradition, Bruskewitz as author-itarian villain, or a balanced presentation of both views. Instead of pursuing the professional third option, they opted for the bishop as villain.

Newsbites for the April 1996 Mediawatch
</h2></center>
<p>

<b>First Pitch Glitch</b><br>

NBC's Tom Brokaw swung and missed when he tried to cover for the President. During the traditional first pitch thrown by the President on baseball's Opening Day, Bill Clinton was roundly booed by many in attendance at the April 2 Orioles game. Brokaw delivered the play-by-play:
<p>
"President Clinton taking the mound for the ceremonial first pitch. All the way from the pitcher's rubber, it was a little on the high side, and watching from the stands and not booing like most of the rest of the crowd -- Pat Buchanan. By the way the boos, like the first pitch, are traditional whoever the President.
<p>
Dan Rather didn't even mention the boos on the same night's CBS Evening News. Viewers only heard cheering at Clinton's lob. But on that day's CNN Inside Politics Bruce Morton replayed five recent Opening Day first pitches, one from Ronald Reagan, three from George Bush, and a previous Clinton throw. In all five, including Clinton's earlier pitch, the President was cheered.
<p>

<b>The Nadir of Coverage</b><br>

GOP presidential candidates like Pat Buchanan and Phil Gramm were not only labeled as conservative but as "hard right," "extreme," and "hard-line." Then it would only make sense that someone to the left of Bill Clinton would be considered, at the very least, a liberal. But in the midst of Ralph Nader's campaign for President on the Green Party ballot, reporters referred to the outspoken leftist as not "hard left" or "far left" but as merely a "consumer advocate" or "consumer activist."
<p>
Since the media started paying attention to the Nader candidacy, reporters have failed to mention liberal in the same sentence as Nader. NBC's Gwen Ifill referred to him as "the consumer activist" on the March 24 Nightly News. On The World Today the same night, CNN's Martin Savidge reported: "Consumer advocate Ralph Nader says he'll be on California's presidential ballot this fall." In a search of Time, Newsweek, U.S. News & World Report, The Washington Post, The New York Times, and USA Today, only U.S. News mentioned the "L" word: the March 25 issue called Nader a "liberal alternative to Clinton." 
<p>

<b>What's "Risky and Radical"?</b><br> 

On the March 12 CBS Evening News, Dan Rather warned of coming Social Security reform proposals: "The stock market could play a big role in major changes in Social Security. A bipartisan commission is due out soon to officially propose some radical changes in the whole Social Security system that would include privatizing Social Security, allowing some of your Social Security contributions to be invested in the stock market. Now, this may or may not prove to be a good idea, but it could be risky business." 
<p>
CBS reporter Bob Schieffer, who also called the plan "radical change," stated on the March 26 CBS This Morning that "even more radical, [is] a plan favored by some commission members to allow taxpayers to invest, any way they want, almost half of what they now pay in Social Security taxes." How does the media's take on Social Security reform stack up against other large-scale changes proposed in Washington? 
<p>
Database searches reveal that not once did a network reporter refer to the Clinton health care plan as "radical." The plan Hillary Clinton and Ira Magaziner cooked up amounted to a government take-over of one-seventh of the economy. That's not radical -- but allowing people to invest their own retirement money is.

<p><b>
Cartooning Contrasts.
</b><br>
During this year's Lenten season, when Christians examine their faith and commitment to God, the Los Angeles Times decided to show its own hostility to religion. In the March 28 issue the paper ran an editorial cartoon with the image of Bob Dole crucified. The crown of thorns on his forehead read "Christian Coalition."
<p>
Three days later, the paper spiked Johnny Hart's Palm Sunday B.C. comic strip, featuring the character Wiley writing a poem honoring Christ's death for man's sins. Los Angeles Times spokeswoman Ariel Remler told The Washington Times that "lately he's [Hart] been running cartoons with religious overtones." Then in an April 2 statement quoted in The Washington Times, Remler announced that the paper would spike the strip on all three days of the Easter weekend. After receiving hundreds of protest calls, the paper reversed itself, announcing it would run the Friday and Saturday strips.
<p>
Two years ago, the Times played a similar game, spiking Hart's "inappropriate" Easter Sunday strip with a resurrection theme, but then ran in June a series of Garry Trudeau's Doonesbury strips featuring John Boswell's controversial claim that the Catholic Church sanctioned same-sex marriages in the middle ages.  
<p>
<b>
No Liberal Lobbies.
</b><br>
In March, the House of Representatives voted on repealing the assault weapons ban and outlawing partial-birth abortion. But the media found a narrow "lobby" on only one side of these issues. During the gun debate in late March, the networks employed the term "gun lobby" over six times on the morning and evening news to denote those who opposed the ban. Most happened on CBS, like the March 21 CBS Evening News piece where Bob Schieffer announced: "With Republicans knowing they lack the votes to override a veto and with little enthusiasm for any of this in the Senate, the House effort may turn out to be little more than a publicity stunt to impress the gun lobby."
<p>
In the liberal lexicon of Washington, an industry is termed a "lobby" when it pushes narrow interest for its own gain. But those who opposed the partial birth abortion ban were pushing a narrow, extreme interest to satisfy their own backers. Yet not once during the congressional wrangling over partial birth abortions did anyone on the networks use the term "abortion lobby." 
<p>
<b>
Gender Chasm!
</b><br>
Like they do every presidential election year, reporters are raising the so-called gender gap, claiming that Republicans have problems attracting women. On the March 25 NBC Nightly News, essayist Anne Taylor Fleming stated: "Polls show a huge gender gap brewing. Women, like these we gathered, are more upset than men by budget cuts and family issues that they feel are being ignored." So do Democrats have a problem attracting men? Yes, but this didn't interest ABC and NBC.
<p>
On Good Morning America Sunday March 24, ABC's Jack Smith recalled the budget fight: "Where men saw deficit reduction, women worried about what the cuts were doing." In the ensuing discussion, co-host Willow Bay asserted: "If you're still making 70 cents to that male dollar, you're probably more reluctant to see cuts in social spending -- your safety net."
<p>
While some attributed the gap to social spending, others cited the GOP's pro-life stance. NBC's Lisa Myers began her report on the March 5 Nightly News: "Republicans have a problem with women....And today, polls show women leaning even more heavily in favor of Democrats. The big reason: Pat Buchanan." Myers spoke to Maine Sen. Olympia Snowe and stated: "Snowe says even though Buchanan won't be the nominee, his polarizing anti-abortion rhetoric has done lasting damage." Myers concluded that Clinton's lead over Dole with women is "not a gender gap, [it's] a chasm."
<p>
If reporters believe the gap is due to abortion, they need to examine the polls. A May 1995 Tarrance Group poll found that 47 percent of women (compared to 44 percent of men) believe that abortion should be "illegal and prohibited under all circumstances" or "illegal except in cases such as rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother."
<p>
<b>
Green Gary
</b><br>
Guilt by association is still a handy media tool. The March 21 Washington Post headline read: "Industry Funds Global Warming Skeptics." Reporter Gary Lee began: "A Washington environmental group charged yesterday that three researchers who are outspoken critics of the scientific evidence for global warming have received hundreds of thousands of dollars from the petroleum and coal industries, and that this funding has influenced their views."
<p>
Lee described his source, Ozone Action, only as "an environmental group that lobbies on the issues of air quality and global climate change." Lee didn't use the word liberal or note they've even criticized Vice President Gore for being too soft on the environment. While Lee did call the researchers for comment, and quoted Patrick Michaels calling the charges "ludicrous," Lee excluded one obvious point: liberal environmental groups also take in hundreds of thousands of dollars from oil companies. The Capital Research Center noted that Exxon gave the National Audubon Society $112,500 in 1991 alone. The Post didn't do that man-pays-for-dog-to-bite-him story.
<p>

<b>Gannett Fires Like America.
</b><br>
The Gannett-owned Burlington [Vt.] Free Press fired Paul Teetor for reporting a story accurately, another victim of political correctness. But now he's been vindicated. In August 1993, Teetor angered black activists by reporting that a white woman was escorted from a community forum on racism after she tried to address it. A black city official, Rodney Patterson, told her the microphone they had set up for comments was for people "of color" only, not whites. After the story appeared, black activists demanded Teetor be fired for publishing an inaccurate story, even though a videotape confirmed Teetor's account. The Free Press canned him and ran a piece whitewashing Teetor's account of the meeting in accordance with the activists' demand.
<p>
Teetor filed a lawsuit against the paper. According to the March 29 Washington Post, the paper settled in his favor for an undisclosed sum. At trial, Teetor's lawyer alleged the real reason for the firing was the Gannett chain's "All-American Contest" where papers are evaluated and scored on how many minorities the paper hires and how positively minorities are depicted in news stories. Free Press editors were worried how the town meeting story would affect their scores because the contest results could be a factor in their own job promotions. 
<p>

<b>Fighting Forbes
</b><br>
The day before Steve Forbes ended his presidential bid, CBS reporter Phil Jones declared on the Evening News: "He struck fear in the hearts of his opponents by launching what may turn out to be the most massive, negative TV attack campaign in the history of American politics." Jones failed to mention the role CBS played in promoting negative politics. The network provided opponents with a free negative ad when it ran Eric Engberg's February 8 hit piece on the Forbes flat tax. Engberg referred to Forbes' "number one wackiest flat tax pro- mise." No wonder the Center for Media and Public Affairs found that with 87 percent derogatory comments, Engberg was the most negative reporter during the primaries.
<p>
<b>
Goldberg Survives, for Now. 
</b><br>

Speaking of Eric Engberg, CBS reporter Bernard Goldberg returned to the air April 9 with an Evening News "Eye on America" segment on rising youth crime caused by a deficit of values. Goldberg had been off the air since his February 13 Wall Street Journal op-ed arguing Engberg's story "set new standards for bias" and the liberal bias charge is "blatantly true."
<p>
The CBS Evening News had been airing "Bernard Goldberg's America," but CBS News President Andrew Heyward dumped the feature and has assigned him to the "Eye on America" beat. Goldberg's eight-week shunning and loss of his signature piece, however, may not be his only punishments. The Washington Post's John Carmody reported March 22: "Heyward would not comment on Goldberg's future when his contract expires at the end of the year." So much for promoting free speech.

Media Tied Talk Radio, Conservatives and Gingrich to Oklahoma City, But the Unabomber's On His Own
</b><br>
After the April 1995 Oklahoma City bombing the media hurled charges of complicity at conservatives. Referring to Newt Gingrich's language, Time declared that the "burden of fostering the delusion" that government is the enemy "is borne not just by the nut cases who preach conspiracy but also to some extent by those who erode faith in governance in the pursuit of their own ambitions." Asked Bob Schieffer on Face the Nation: "There's been a lot of anti-government rhetoric, it comes over talk radio...Do you think that that somehow has led these people to commit this act?" 
<p>
But this April, even after ABC detailed the Unabomber's left-wing ties, the rest of the media failed to pick up the theme.  
<P>
Two days after suspect Ted Kaczynski's April 3 arrest, Brian Ross reported on World News Tonight that his "name appeared...in connection with an FBI investigation of a radical environmental group called Earth First...Over the years, Earth First has been best known as a violent group spiking trees and blowing up logging equipment, and in many respects its anti-corporate philosophy parallels that of the Unabomber." 
<P>
Ross noted "that authorities believe Kaczynski was at a meeting attended by top Earth First members." A private investigator, Ross relayed, "says the bomb last year that killed the head of the California Forestry Association clearly can be tracked back to a hit list published in one radical environmental journal."
Instead of being consistent,  reporters buried the tie. On April 8 the environmental angle made it into the 35th paragraph of a USA Today story as well as the 15th paragraph in The New York Times that day and The Washington Post the next. Insisting "there is no proof," NBC's David Bloom dismissed the link April 10.
<P>
The Unabomber manifesto rails against capitalism (it begins "The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race"), but the April 15 Time noted no one recalled him having contact at Berkeley "with the leftists he would later excoriate in his manifesto." 
<P>
Some were sympathetic. USA Today's April 11 front page read: "UNABOMBER: A Hero to Some." Richard Price reported he's "being romanticized for his intellect" as "some people even feel sorry for him, seeing him a brilliant boy gone astray." On C-SPAN's Sunday Journal April 7, Time's Elaine Shannon found parts of the manifesto she agreed with, such as, "industrialization and pollution are all terrible things." She reasoned: "He wasn't a hypocrite, he lived as he wrote." Kaczynski "carried it to an extreme, and obviously murder is something that is far beyond any political philosophy, but he had a bike, he didn't have any plumbing."

Rotten in Denmark?
</b><br>
The media have often promoted liberal claims about the dangers of "overpopulation." Now that a new book, Our Stolen Future (with an introduction by Al Gore) theorizes that man-made chemicals are responsible for impending sterility, the media reaction is the same: unquestioned acceptance of ominous liberal claims. 
<P>
Time science writer Michael Lemonick wrote March 18 that "In study after study, sperm counts in men the world over seem to be dropping precipitously." He claimed the book contains "powerful evidence" to support the hypothesis that "reproduction-related ills may be caused by chemical pollutants in the environment, including DDT." The book is based on data from a Danish scientist, Niels Skakkebaek, whose meta-analysis of 61 sperm count studies found a 50 percent decline since 1938.
<P>
Though Lemonick wrote "the evidence for a chemical-infertility link does remain largely circumstantial," he warned of apocalypse: "Extrapolating from Skakkebaek's admittedly controversial data, it's conceivable that the average man will be infertile within a century. Even if things are only half that dire, it would be bad news indeed for the human race."
<P>
<i>Today's</i> Bryant Gumbel used the same tone with book cowriter Theo Colborn on March 12: "The extinction of the human race has long been a staple of science fiction, but according to a group of scientists, it could one day prove to be all too true, and they say the cause of the problem may be man-made chemicals." 
In a letter to Today, Dr. Glenn Swogger of the American Council on Science and Health claimed Colborn's "claims of lower sperm counts relates to a subsequently discredited study a number of years ago and is stale news in the scientific community...We run the risk of so limiting pesticide use through excessive regulation and discouragement of research that we will lose the valuable contribution they make to producing cheap and healthy fruits and vegetables." Gumbel only mentioned the ACSH to note they're "partially funded...by industry."
<P>
Robert Hager provided a more sober account on the April 1 NBC Nightly News, noting critics claimed the book was "bad science." Journalist Ronald Bailey was then allowed to critique the book's science in NBC's "In Their Own Words" segment.

<b>Bryant Gumbel, a Conservative? 
</b>
<br>
The March 21 Radio & TV Correspondents Dinner drew a lot of pressattention to the remarks of talk show host Don Imus, but the betterstory came from Marc Morano, Rush Limbaugh's man in D.C. He asked reporters in attendance about liberal bias, and the reporters only demonstrated their liberalism. 
<P>
Former CBS anchor Walter Cronkite admitted: "Everybody knows that there's a liberal, that there's a heavy liberal persuasion among correspondents." Cronkite argued, however, this is justified:"Anybody who has to live with the people, who covers police stations, covers county courts, brought up that way, has to have a degree of humanity that people who do not have that exposure don't have, and some people interpret that to be liberal. It's not a liberal, it's humanitarian and that's a vastly different thing."
<P>
When asked about the new Whitewater book, Blood Sport by JamesStewart, ABC's John Cochran felt the book was beneath him: "I haven't read it. I'm just now going through Elizabeth Drew's book,which is about the battle between the Gingrich Congress and theClinton White House and it's fascinating. It has nothing to do with gossip or Whitewater or what happened with Vince Foster or any ofthat, it has to do with what's happening with issues of importance to the American people." CBS's Bill Plante felt the issue was a waste of time: "The problem with the media coverage of Whitewater is that it has been done over and over and over again. I haven't read the book yet, but I understand that there's nothing basically new in it."
<P>
CNN's Judy Woodruff retorted to a query about Bernard Goldberg's comments about liberal bias: "I think Mr. Goldberg went a little bit too far...I don't think there's any blatant, rampant bias in the news media. If there were, then we wouldn't last in the jobs that we have." Most incredibly, Today weatherman Al Roker claimed:"I don't think there's a liberal bias in the media. Let me put it this way, I've never worked with a liberal anchorman, they're all very conservative." This from the man who shares a studio with Bryant Gumbel.

Revolving Door for the April 1996 Mediawatch.

<P>
<b>Oklahoma Bill's Hate Radio</b><br>

After a year away to deal with heart trouble, Bill Moyers, a former Press Secretary to President Lyndon Johnson, returned to NBC on April 12 to host a Dateline NBC special "Oklahoma City: One Year Later." The day of the show, the New York Post quoted Moyers as insisting that he went to Oklahoma City "with nothing but a desire to find out what was happening. There was no agenda."
<P>
In reality, Moyers implied conservative rhetoric led to the bombing. But instead of having the integrity to name names or cite statements, Moyers offered an hour filled with vague generalities which held culpable "hate radio" and "the rhetoric of politics this season." Dateline featured this exchange with service station owner Bud Welch, whose daughter was killed:
<P>
Welch: "I thought, the first few months, that there was probably going to be more unity in the country, politically."
Moyers: "That this tragedy would bring us together?"
Welch: "Yes, that this tragedy would bring it together, but we're seeing through the elections that's going on right now, the same negative thoughts, the militia groups, the hate radio."
Moyers: "And you think that contributed to the tragedy, the bombing here?"
Welch: "Absolutely, without a doubt. Because it justifies a lot of the angry feelings that people have."
<P>
As Welch listened to G. Gordon Liddy on his car radio, Moyers charged: "The airwaves are still saturated with militant rhetoric. Day and night you can hear a stream of rage and insult directed with unremitting hostility at government and others. It rubs like salt in deep wounds and some of the families are trying to counter it."  
<P>
Then, as viewers saw several victims being interviewed by KTOK's Carole Arnold, Moyers explained: "Emerging from their private grief, they appeal for an end of hateful talk and political invective. Their experience is their message. What a society sows, it reaps....This local station has given the families a forum, but it also carries several hours of talk every day that they find inflammatory." The station does not carry Liddy, so the broadside against "hate" and "inflammatory" talk goes undefined. Welch proceded to tell Arnold: "Of course I think the media need to be involved a little bit in a little bit of control of the hate radio going on. I'm very disturbed about that. I mean where's the responsibility?"
<P>
Having impugned talk radio, Moyers turned to the government shutdown: "Just as federal workers were coming out of shock from the bombing, there was another blow, this time from Washington." He asked a HUD supervisor who survived the blast: "It's been a tough year for you federal workers here. The bombing, the furlough, you lost pay for a while. You continue to be demonized in the rhetoric of politics this season. What does that do to your idea of yourself?"
<P>
Finally, Moyers concluded the hour with this seeming indictment of House Speaker Newt Gingrich as co-conspirator: "It will never be the same. The bombers saw to that. The tears and grief, the pain and the sorrow were all intended. Terrorism is the politics of murder. We should have seen it coming. Hate was in the air. Government had been vilified, found guilty and sentenced to die. It didn't matter who was in the way. There are lessons for us here, something to take away from the wreckage of that day, if we're listening, one year later."

Study for the April 1996 Mediawatch.

<P><b>
Network Religion Coverage Still Limited to Roughly One Percent of Total Coverage: Social Liberalism Rears Its Head on TV</b> 
<br>
In their survey The Churching of America, Roger Finke and Rodney Stark reported that virtually all Americans believe in God or a universal spirit. The vast majority believe the Bible is either the literal or inspired Word of God. Sixty percent  can be found in houses of worship in a given month. This "silent majority" still worships under the radar screen of a secularized media elite.
<p>
The Media Research Center's first study of TV news coverage of religion in 1993 found a surprising paucity of  coverage and overt advocacy against traditional values: only 212 evening news stories and 197 morning show segments dealt with religion. Prime-time magazine and Sunday morning interview shows broached religion on only 18 occasions.  Religion coverage declined in 1994. Evening news stories rose slightly to 225, but morning segments fell to 151, and Sunday talk show and magazine show segments dropped to nine. 
<P>
Out of an estimated 18,000 segments last year on the five programs evaluated (ABC's World News Tonight, CBS Evening News, CNN's World News, NBC Nightly News, and The MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour on PBS) the networks devoted only 249 stories to religion, a slight increase (11 percent) from 1994.
  <p>
Despite more than 26,000 segments in 1995, the major network morning shows (ABC's Good Morning America, CBS This Morning, and NBC's Today) devoted 224 morning show stories to religion in 1995. That's a one-third increase over 1994, but still less than one percent. 
<P>
The blind spot to religious news remains especially noticeable on Sunday morning shows and prime-time magazines. Analysts reviewed the Sunday shows (ABC's This Week with David Brinkley, CBS's Face the Nation, NBC's Meet the Press) as well as the prime-time magazine lineup (ABC's Day One, Prime Time Live, and 20/20; CBS's Eye to Eye with Connie Chung, 48 Hours, and 60 Minutes; and NBC's three-night Dateline format). Out of roughly 400 shows, the number of religion stories rose from nine in 1994 to 15 in 1995, including segment repeats. But that also included three one-hour programs on religion, one on ABC and two on CBS. 
<P>
Institutions: The Catholic Church again led the coverage with 111 stories, up eight from 1994. Generic religion stories, often on subjects like school prayer or church-state relations, came in second with 70 stories. News of Protestant denominations was again nearly absent.
<P>
The networks again portrayed the Catholic Church as an oppressive, narrow-minded, outmoded hierarchy. When Ireland moved to lift its ban on divorce, CBS Evening News reporter Cinny Kennard applauded on November 18: "It's another example of the country's move to reinvent itself as a more modern and progressive Ireland, an Ireland that is more tolerant and open. Recently, there has been legal reform on contraception, abortion, and homosexuality; signs that the traditional Church grip on Ireland has been loosened; signs that the country is increasingly run from government buildings and not the Vatican." 
<P>
Kennard repeated her line on the November 30 CBS This Morning: "It's been like an awakening. Ireland, long positioned on the world's stage as a church-dominated backwater, has reinvented itself as a new and energized Emerald Isle. A more open, a more tolerant place."
<P>
Abortion: Due to the lack of further violence against abortionists, coverage of violence around abortion clinics on all shows amounted to 142 stories, compared to the 247 in 1994 and 150 segments in 1993. 
<P>
On January 3, 1995 Jane Pauley promoted an upcoming segment on Dateline NBC by charging: "Still ahead -- the latest round of bloodshed and violence at abortion clinics. The anti-abortion movement has been creeping to the edge of bloody fanaticism for a decade." With coverage like that, reporter David Culhane could convey the results of a new poll during the January 8 CBS Evening News: "A new CBS poll shows that three out of four Americans say the protest tactics of some anti-abortion activists can be blamed for leading to the recent shootings at several abortion clinics." 
<p>
What about violence perpetrated by abortion advocates? In 1994, only CNN reported that Ernest Robertson Jr. tried to shoot a pro-life protester after picking up his wife outside a Baton Rouge, Louisiana abortion clinic. In 1995, Daniel Adam Mahoney became the first pro-abortion activist indicted under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act. Alice Hand was arrested in January 1995 for making at least three phone calls threatening to blow-up a Catholic church and school in Suffern, New York. But the networks were silent. 
<P>
While the networks devoted 142 stories to anti-abortion violence outside clinics, only three alluded to violence inside. CNN's September 12 World News broadcast one segment about abortionist David Benjamin, who was convicted of second degree murder in New York City for allowing a woman to bleed to death from a perforated uterus during an abortion. Two 1995 segments aired estimates of 1.5 million abortions a year, two more mentions than in 1993 or 1994. 
<P>

Social Issues: The number of stories primarily about homosexuality increased from 105 in 1994 to 113 in 1995, still a fraction of the 1993 total of 756. But the networks demonstrated a liberal orientation once again: in the few morning show interviews that aired, proponents of homosexuality outnumbered opponents, 13 to 3. 
Once again, the networks portrayed the religious right as a negative force in the Republican Party. While the networks would not suggest that a liberal group like the NAACP doesn't represent all black people, CBS suggested the Christian Coalition did not represent all Christians -- or suggested they were less than Christian.
<P>
Dan Rather introduced a September 8 story by noting Phil Gramm "was at a meeting of preacher Pat Robertson's political group, the one calling itself the Christian Coalition." Four months earlier, on May 15, Rather charged: "The group calling itself the Christian Coalition is aligned with hard-right stands on issues ranging from gay rights to school prayer, and it's demanding its due for its help in getting Republicans elected."

<title> Issue Analysis: Income Stories Ignore Total Compensation</title>

<h2> Issue Analysis: Income Stories Ignore Total Compensation </h2>
<h4>Network Reporting a Slave to Wages </h4>
</center>
Last month, <I>MediaNomics</I> reported that there were 19 stories about layoffs during the first two months of 1996, but only two stories about job growth. We noted how such a focus on the negative offered a distorted picture of the true nature of a competitive economy, which does destroy some jobs, but always creates more jobs.
<p>
The sister issue to job creation is living standards. A competitive economy would be of little benefit to workers if it caused their standard of living to decrease. Media Research Center analysts reviewed every story that focused on wages and incomes on network morning and evening shows during the first three months of 1996. Ten of the 11 stories stressed the alleged wage stagnation of average workers over the last few decades. Only one story pointed out that opportunities have been increasing. No story pointed out that when benefits and payroll taxes are included, workers' total compensation has been steadily increasing.
<p>
A lack of diversity in guest selection kept the morning shows from giving viewers a balanced story. For instance, on the March 12 <I>Today</I>, Bryant Gumbel interviewed only Jared Bernstein of the liberal Economic Policy Institute. Introducing the segment, Gumbel pointed out that the U.S. economy has created eight million new jobs over the last three years, adding that "the quantity of jobs is not being questioned, but the quality is."
<p>
Bernstein then said that "wages and compensation have been falling in our labor market since 1979 for most workers. yet in the current economy, profit rates, or corporate profits, are at a 30-year high." Bernstein also claimed that "this is a long-term trend and workers are experiencing falling wages and compensation and even increased turnover. That is, we have less stable employment and the typical American family is really running faster just to stay in place."
<p>
Gumbel's reaction: "OK, so let us accept all of that as fact. Could it be otherwise?" Since Gumbel didn't provide an alternative opinion, viewers had no choice but to accept Bernstein's assertions as fact.
Other reporters also seemed to assume that accounts of workers' falling wages was a fact. On the February 26 CBS Evening News, Dan Rather concluded that "the fear and anger of some American workers over layoffs and barely rising wages have emerged as a campaign issue." Earlier, on the February 22 CBS Evening News, Rather said: "Millions of American workers know it. Despite soaring profits and a record Wall Street, U.S. businesses are still cutting good jobs and barely raising wages."
<p>
On that same broadcast, correspondent Wyatt Andrews portrayed "an increasingly anxious middle class, whose dreams of upward mobility have met a downward reality." According to NBC's Mike Jensen, on the March 4 Nightly News, "William Young of California is typical -- 50, a victim of downsizing, laid off by Northrup after 29 years in the aerospace industry."
<p>
On the February 25 <I>World News Sunday</I>, ABC's Jeff Greenfield, normally one of the most balanced reporters at the networks, also bought the party line. He reported "something very disturbing behind the record Wall Street numbers and corporate profits." He interviewed a Wall Street economist who said, "This surge in financial markets was really based on an untenable situation of workers taking a real squeeze in living standards to improve corporate profit margins and competitive prowess." Greenfield called this the "dark side of productivity."
<p>
But just how dark is the American wage and income picture? According to Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas economists W. Michael Cox and Beverly J. Fox, writing in a January National Center for Policy Analysis Policy Backgrounder, it's not as bad as many have been led to believe. The problem with most analyses of stagnating wages is they don't look at benefits. Cox and Fox pointed out that "employee benefits have grown from 20 percent of payroll in 1953 to more than 41 percent today." Since benefits aren't taxed, they argue, employees have sought benefit increases. Increasing payroll taxes have also taken a bite out of wages.
<p>
Cox and Fox also maintain that looking at stagnating household income, as Bernstein apparently was, is misleading. "Today's households are nearly 15 percent smaller than they were in the 1970s -- so household income is spread over fewer people," they report. "The median family income statistics for yesterday's Brady Bunch cannot be accurately compared with those of today's Murphy Brown." Overall, Cox and Fox demonstrate that "per capita real personal income increased an average of 1.4 percent a year" from 1974 through 1993. Unfortunately neither they nor like-minded economists were interviewed by network reporters.
<p>
Only NBC's Jim Avila, on the March 4 <I>Nightly News</I>, gave any hint that the job and wage picture for American workers was not completely bleak. Though he didn't point out that total compensation has been increasing for American workers over the last few decades, he did look at small businesses creating jobs and noted that "many of the new jobs being created provide good salaries, full benefits, and something some of the old jobs did not provide -- a piece of the action. Often small companies offer new employees stock options and other incentives." According to Avila, "The workplace has changed, perhaps forever. The job security of the past replaced by uncertainty and, more often than you might think, also replaced by new opportunity." But, of course, Avila was the exception.

<center><h2>Bright Side for May 1996 Media Watch</h2></center>
<p>
<h3>NBC: Tough on Criminals?</h3>
<p>
Any suggested link between crime and welfare dependency is usually dismissed by the media as Willie Horton redux. However, Elizabeth Vargas' March 26 Dateline report showed that often welfare money acts as a direct subsidy for scofflaws.
Vargas noted there are "more than 415,000 fugitives on the lam across the country, men and women wanted by the law for serious crimes." After a morning expedition with the Cuyahoga Ohio County Sheriff department, knocking on doors in a fruitless search for a fugitive, she noted that "just a few blocks away from the sheriff's department is all the information those officers say they need. Here in this office are the names, addresses, phone numbers, even photographs, of some of those fugitives from justice. People fleeing from the law but not from the welfare department."
Vargas deftly phrased the irony: "So, while one government agency spends your tax dollars to find fugitives from the law, another government agency gives more of your tax dollars, welfare, to fugitives in hiding." 
After interviewing county welfare director Joseph Garcia claiming the police were on a "fishing expedition" and targeting the poor, Vargas noted that after McFall went public with his battle against federal privacy laws that prevent welfare departments from sharing names and addresses, "deputies are getting some information."
Robert Hager probed the same politically incorrect line in his Fleecing of America report on the April 24 Nightly News. 
Anchor Tom Brokaw introduced the story: "How would you feel if you found out your tax dollars were paying a massive telephone bill for calls that never should have been made, calls coming from prisoners?"
Hager related the General Accounting Office findings of prisoners calling the Agriculture Department -- collect: "652 collect calls accepted from eighteen prisons in all, in just the four months auditors sampled." Hager explained, "The prisoners had found dishonest employees at the Agricultural Department's Washington headquarters, willing to forward on their calls long-distance to whomever the prisoners wanted to talk to, private individuals, anywhere, at taxpayers expense," even calls to sex lines in the Dominican Republic.
<p>
<h3>Stossel on Davis-Bacon</h3>
<p>
In 1931, Congress passed the Davis Bacon Act, prompted by white laborers who were upset that blacks were underbidding them on government contracts. Davis Bacon sets minimum wages for contractors that build government buildings. On the April 12 20/20, ABC's John Stossel looked at how this out-dated government regulation continues to cost taxpayers millions and benefits a major contributor to the Democratic Party: labor unions.
Stossel started at the Labor Department, the agency that enforces Davis Bacon. Stossel explained: "Dozens of them [employees] here, and others in state and city labor departments, spend their time deciding what construction workers on government projects must be paid. The result? Government buildings cost more and poor people who want to work can't." Stossel explained: "Carpenter David Shepherd must get $29 an hour. Normally he makes $15. Sheet metal worker Mike Harley has his pay doubled by the Labor Department."
Stossel explained how the Labor Department uses a complicated formula to issue their wage edicts. In turn, prevailing wages are often set higher than union wages so open-shop contractors can't underbid union shops. Stossel referred to the unions clout: "It is true that the law protects union jobs from cheaper competition. And if a Congressman even discusses changing the law, crowds like this [footage of a congressional hearing with union members] will remind him of the union's clout. Congress' most potent defender of Davis Bacon has been Sen. Edward Kennedy. He declined our request to talk about this."
Stossel went on to point out that while these higher wages may benefit some, there's also a downside for less-skilled laborers. Stossel pointed out: "A side effect of fixing wages is that some workers end up being excluded." At Cabrini Green in Chicago, one of the nation's poorest housing projects, the government is doing repairs. Some construction workers who reside at Cabrini Green would like to be hired to do the work, but as Stossel learned: "They can't get hired because when contractors are forced to pay high Davis Bacon salaries even for the simplest jobs, they're not going to take a chance on inexperienced strangers, they're going to use their most experienced workers."

<h3>Issue Analysis: Reporters Miss Important Angles of Debate<br>
MINIMUM WAGE</h3>
<p>

One of the key debates currently defining the differences between Republicans and Democrats is the argument over efforts to raise the minimum wage. Democrats argue that the government can legislate higher pay for those earning the minimum wage without harming anyone. Republicans, on the other hand, argue that by artificially raising wages, the government will cause employers to lay off workers.
<p>
On which side did the media weigh in? Media Research Center analysts reviewed all of the minimum wage stories on evening news shows (ABC, CBS, CNN, NBC) and morning news shows (ABC, CBS, NBC). There were 36 stories and anchor-reads about the debate. With a few notable exceptions, the networks took the side of those supporting a minimum wage increase. For example:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Soundbite sources were almost twice as likely to be supporters of the minimum wage increase than opponents. Out of 60 soundbite sources, 39 supported the minimum wage increase, while only 21 were opposed to it. Several stories contained soundbites from only Democrats and their allies.
<p>
Bob Schieffer's April 25 CBS Evening News report, for instance, had soundbites from Democrats Maxine Waters, Ted Kennedy, Al Gore, and two minimum wage workers whom the Democrats had brought to Washington for a news conference. "Democrats will keep the pressure up," Schieffer said. "They believe that Republicans are taking such a pounding on this they'll eventually allow a vote." He didn't tell viewers what Republicans believed.
<p>
This emphasis on supporters of the minimum wage hike led some reporters to just accept the Democrats' opinion that the wage could be increased without harming workers. According to NBC's Lisa Myers, on the April 17 Nightly News, a minimum wage increase would be "good news for about 10 million workers now earning near the minimum wage of $4.25 an hour, frozen since 1989." CNN's Kathleen Kennedy, on the April 24 The World Tonight, worried that "people earning the minimum wage may not get a raise anytime soon. Despite political pressure from both parties, House Republican leaders Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey have virtually ruled out scheduling a vote on the minimum wage increase."
<p>
<li>The political horse-race aspect of the debate was emphasized far more than the economics of the debate. There were only three soundbites from economists. There were 46 soundbites from politicians. The networks were much more interested in who would win and lose politically from the debate than what the effect would be on the country. According to NBC's Tom Brokaw, on the April 17 Nightly News, it was likely that "the most basic wage in this country affecting millions of workers and businesses will go up. But, who gets the credit?"
<p>
This weighed heavily on the minds of other reporters, as well. NBC's Jim Miklaszewski, on the April 24 Nightly News, predicted that "by digging in their heals, Republicans may also be digging themselves into a political hole." And ABC's Cokie Roberts, on the April 23 Good Morning America, said: "If the Republicans are stuck going along, then they want to get some credit."
<p>
<li>Journalists were more interested in interviewing other journalists than in interviewing economists. On the morning news shows, the obsession with political angles reached almost comic proportions. On the morning shows, where live interviews are common, there were five such interviews of journalists about the minimum wage. There were none with economists.
<p>
ABC's Willow Bay interviewed ABC's Sam Donaldson on a Good Morning America Sunday segment. ABC's Charles Gibson interviewed ABC's Cokie Roberts and ABC's Tyler Mathison on a Good Morning America segment. NBC's Bryant Gumbel interviewed NBC's Tim Russert on a Today segment. And CBS's Harry Smith interviewed The Weekly Standard's Fred Barnes. None of these shows were interested in the insights of economists, however.
<p>
<li>There was more skepticism of Republican motives than Democratic motives. Three stories suggested that Republicans opposed raising the minimum wage because their business allies opposed it. ABC's Carole Simpson, on the April 28 World News Sunday, reported that Republicans "say [a minimum wage hike] is bad for small business." According to Bob Schieffer, on the April 17 CBS Evening News, Republicans "know polls show most Americans favor an increase, but many of their business allies oppose it." Neither Simpson or Schieffer suggested that Republicans may oppose an increase because it would hurt workers.
<p>
No reporter made the similar charge against Democrats, that they support the increase simply because their labor allies support it. NBC's Jim Miklaszewski, on the April 25 Today, did at least state that there was a principle at stake for the GOP: "They can stand their ground on principle on this issue, but lose ground in public opinion." He did not explain what that principle was, though.
<p>
<li>The one study of the impact of minimum wage increases cited by reporters is one most economists disavow. The infamous Card-Krueger study, named after the two economists who directed it, was mentioned favorably in two stories. Card and Krueger looked at the impact of a minimum wage increase in New Jersey, compared to neighboring Pennsylvania, which hadn't increased its state minimum wage. They found that there was no job loss in New Jersey due to the increase. Since this is one of the only studies to produce such a finding, it is often cited by advocates of increasing the minimum wage.
<p>
ABC's Tyler Mathison mentioned the study on the April 23 Good Morning America. NBC's Mike Jensen also mentioned it favorably on the April 26 Nightly News. Neither of them mentioned the well-publicized problems many economists found with the study's methodology. Jensen, in fact, used a soundbite from one of the study's chief critics, economist Richard Berman, but didn't mention his criticisms of the study. He even employed an Alan Krueger soundbite to refute Berman.
<p>
There were exceptions.
<p>
Anthony Mason, interview with Republican Senator Don Nickles and Democratic Congressman David Bonior: "After the last increase in the minimum wage, Department of Labor statistics show we lost some half a million jobs, I believe. Is this going to cost us jobs? Are we making a mistake if we do this now?" Mason: "Congressman, in the first two years of President Clinton's term, when you controlled Congress, this issue was never brought up. Why is it on the table suddenly now, when we're running up to an election. You had an opportunity to something and it wasn't done then."

<h2>Janet Cooke Award</h2>

<H3>Legal Services or Liberal Services?<BR>
CBS Reporter Terence Smith Touts<BR>  
Politicized Lawyers' Work "For The Poor"</H3>
<P>
<DD>To convince Congress they deserve more funding, advocates of government  
programs regularly highlight examples of all those the program benefits.  
Reporters should look for the reality. For touting the Legal Services  
Corporation (LSC) as if he were on staff, CBS's Terence Smith earned the  
Janet Cooke Award.
<DD>His April 28 Sunday Morning story focused on Legal Services of Greater  
Miami: "They deal mostly with bread-and-butter issues: housing,  
employment, custody, divorce. The concept of helping the poor with their  
problems would seem, on the face of it, to be something most Americans  
could agree upon. But Legal Services is one of those hot-button issues  
that divides people on political, practical, and ideological grounds."
CBS did not present a balanced slate of proponents and opponents, with  
18 soundbites of LSC backers and three from LSC opponent Rep. Charles  
Taylor (R-N.C.), who revealed: "Many of the cases that I've seen are  
very extreme, radical areas that are being funded by the taxpayers...It  
is not the average elderly person being evicted from homes that you  
would have people believe that you defend. There's more of this radical  
view, I see, funded by the taxpayer."
<DD>Smith never allowed Taylor to elaborate. For decades, the LSC has used  
its grants to fight against conservative policies. As LSC chairman,  
Hillary Clinton funneled taxpayer money into defeating a 1980 California  
ballot initiative (Proposition 9) to cut state income taxes in half. In  
1983, the General Accounting Office cited the LSC for violating  
statutory bars against partisan activity. 
<DD>In 1994, The Washington Times reported the state of California was  
forced by the LSC-funded Western Center on Law and Poverty to revoke a  
2.3 percent reduction in welfare payments, costing an estimated $5.6  
million a month. They also filed successful suits to increase payments  
to MediCal, the state's Medicaid plan, and force the state to pay day  
 been terminated by this particular time." 20
Smith moved on: "Barbara Goulsby is the Legal Services attorney for  
Damon Johnson, and 36 families who lost their possessions when Miami  
police suddenly evicted them from their apartment building in a  
drug-infested neighborhood. The city said the building was a center for  
drug activity." 
<DD>To complete the picture of victims, Smith added: "Daniel Barker, another  
Legal Services attorney, is helping Deborah Williams fight eviction from  
her apartment...He interceded with the public housing authority, which  
had accused her of having unauthorized persons living in the apartment."  
Smith asked Williams: "Where would you have been without Legal  
Services?...On the street?" Williams agreed: "Yes, exactly, okay?"
CBS did not investigate whether LSC grantees use tax dollars to fight  
the eviction of drug dealers from public housing. The August 15, 1994  
New York Times reported a group representing 500,000 New York tenants  
entered a case to back expedited eviction of drug dealers, only to be  
opposed by the Legal Aid Society, an LSC grantee. (New York public  
housing officials declared drug-related arrests in their complexes grew  
from 813 in 1973 to 11,092 in 1993). As Boehm testified to Congress: "A  
program determined to use public funds to keep drug dealers in public  
housing -- in the name of helping the poor -- is a program that's lost  
what it means to help the poor."
<DD>Smith asked: "So what are the prospects for Legal Services, given the  
current political climate?...Charles Taylor wants to kill the program."  
Taylor declared: "We've been able to take it from $400 million down to  
283, right at the moment. We need to take it to zero." Smith noted:  
"That won't happen this year. But last week Congress imposed new  
restrictions on Legal Service attorneys, barring them from bringing  
class-action suits, challenging welfare reform, and representing many  
immigrants." Smith did not explain why the new restrictions were  
necessary.
<DD>Taylor's press secretary, Jack Cox, told MediaWatch the CBS story  
followed a formula: "Every single time we've done an interview, the  
reporter finds one local group, interviews a few nice little fuzzy cases  
where people say `I couldn't live without them,' and then they quote us  
saying `Zero it out.' They never let us give the justifications for  
zeroing it out. I sat in on the CBS interview for more than an hour.  
[Taylor] must have hammered home the drug-dealer issue about 40 times to  
 get it into the piece." It didn't get in.
<DD>Smith told MediaWatch he stood by his use of Taylor: "I would argue  
that's a very full description of his view of Legal Services." As for  
the story's imbalance, Smith declared, "Obviously, I think it was fair."  
When asked about drug-related evictions, Smith protested that he was  
unfamiliar with the New York case and insisted: "Taylor did not cite a  
single specific case. When I asked attorneys in Florida, they said  
they'd never represent a convicted drug pusher."

<H2>Media Clique Clap for Clinton</H2>
<H3>Nine of Ten Washington Reporters Voted  
for Clinton; Are Liberal by 6 to 1
</H3>
<DD>When Americans went to the polls in 1992, 43 percent voted for Bill  
Clinton and 38 percent for George Bush. But the results were very  
different in another America, the news media's Washington bureaus.  A  
poll of 139 bureau chiefs and congressional reporters discovered 89  
percent pulled the lever for Clinton and seven percent picked Bush.  
In mid-April the Freedom Forum released a report examining  
media-congressional relations. Buried in the appendix were "a few final  
questions for classification purposes only." These were part of a 58  
question Roper Center survey completed by mail in November and December  
1995. 
<DD>Asked "How would you characterize your political orientation?" 61  
percent said "liberal" or "liberal to moderate." Only nine percent  
labeled themselves "conservative" or "moderate to conservative."
The poll also found that 59 percent considered the Contract with America  
"an election-year campaign ploy" while only three percent thought it was  
"a serious reform proposal." A decisive 85 percent admitted they were  
"very" or "somewhat" surprised by the 1994 GOP win. 
<DD>So do these views affect the news? Study chief and former Chicago  
Tribune reporter Elaine Povich told the April 18 Washington Times: "One  
of the things about being a professional is that you attempt to leave  
your personal feelings aside as you do your work." Boston Globe Editor  
Matthew Storin insisted on CNN's Reliable Sources April 21: "I think,  
actually, those figures are a great endorsement for the professionalism  
of our business. Has anyone looked at the coverage of Bill Clinton's  
administration? I mean, it's been, almost from the get-go, negative."
On the April 28 Fox News Sunday Linda Chavez opined that people realize  
reporters' personal views influence their reporting, prompting Wall  
Street Journal Executive Washington Editor Al Hunt to coun-ter: "If that  
poll is correct, it basically reaffirms the argument that Linda just  
argued against. Which is, would anyone argue that Bill Clinton has  
gotten an easy press the last three years? If 89 percent voted for him,  
he's gotten an awfully tough press." Later he asked incredulously: "You  
think his health care proposals got a good press?"
One reporter on the CNN show realized the impact. The Washington Post's  
Howard Kurtz explained: "Clearly anybody looking at those numbers, if  
they're even close to accurate, would conclude that there is a diversity  
problem in the news business, and it's not just the kind of diversity we  
usually talk about, which is not getting enough minorities in the news  
business, but political diversity, as well. Anybody who doesn't see that  
is just in denial." Indeed.

<h2>Revolving Door</h2>
<P>
<H4>Snow on Sunday</H4>

<DD>To moderate its new Sunday morning public affairs show, Fox News Sunday,  
the network tapped Tony Snow. Those hired by the media who have liberal  
ties don't raise a concern in the journalistic world. But the selection  
of the conservative Snow prompted some reporters to question the slant  
of the show, although Marty Ryan, former Executive Producer of NBC's  
Today, will hold the same title with Fox News Sunday. "A rabidly  
conservative columnist and former speechwriter for President George  
Bush, Snow knows that his right-wing image may put off lefties,"  
declared Philadelphia Inquirer television reporter Gail Shister on April  
8.  Shister explained that "as for some critics' contentions that Snow could  
be `tainted' by his Bush connections, he says: `I've worked for half as  
many politicians'" as Meet the Press host Tim Russert, who toiled for  
former Governor Mario Cuomo and Senator Daniel Moynihan, both New York  
Democrats. The show, which premiered April 28, is aimed at younger  
viewers and will include questions sent via the internet.
<P>
<H4>Filling the Slate</H4>
<P>
<DD>Michael Kinsley, Editor of Microsoft's new online publication, Slate,  
has built his team. Among those tapped by the liberal former co-host of  
CNN's Crossfire: Jodie Allen, Editor of the Washington Post Outlook  
section since 1990, who served under President Carter as Deputy  
Secretary of Labor for policy evaluation and research. For Slate, to  
debut May 31 on the internet, she'll be the Washington editor.
<P>
<H4>Revolving Online</H4>
<P>
<DD>First she reported the news, then she spun the news. Now Kathleen  
deLaski will do both in cyberspace in a post which involves covering  
Clinton's re-election effort. America Online, the on-line computer  
service, National Journal reported March 16, "has hired deLaski to  
direct campaign coverage for its politics channel." In 1988 she became  
an on-air Washington reporter for ABC News. She jumped to the Clinton  
team in 1993 as Chief Public Affairs Officer for the Defense Department.  
For the past year she's been Deputy to the Undersecretary for Policy  
Liaison.
<P>
<H4>Recalling Candidacy</H4>
<P>
<DD>Since late last year Walter Shapiro, Press Secretary to Carter Labor  
Secretary Ray Marshall and a Time Senior Editor from 1987 to 1993, has  
penned a twice-weekly news section column for USA Today. 20
Shapiro began his April 12 "Hype & Glory," in which he fawned over  
Victor Morales, the Democratic Senate nominee in Texas, by recalling his  
own early partisan foray: "Nearly a quarter of a century ago, at the  
height of the Vietnam War, I was seized by the quixotic notion that  
anti-war students deserved representation in Congress." At the time he  
was a 25-year-old graduate student at the University of Michigan.  
Shapiro lost, but he noted "I did come within 1,400 votes of winning a  
six-way Democratic Primary. My partisan days are long behind me."
<P>
<H4>Willie Hortonizing CNN<H4>
<P>
<DD>CNN announced in March that Ken Bode, a top aide in Democrat Morris  
Udall's 1976 presidential run, will be a national political analyst. An  
April 26 Washington Week in Review look at Bob Dole's claim that Clinton  
has nominated liberal judges, offered a preview of Bode's analysis. From  
his perch as moderator of the PBS show, Bode asked: "So, federal judges  
are going to become this year's Willie Horton?"

<h2>Hugh Downs' Hate Radio--ABC's Avuncular Star On the Left</h2>

<DD>Hugh Downs may seem harmless hosting 20/20, but in the Spring Forbes  
MediaCritic Steve Kroll revealed another side -- a liberal ideologue in  
weekly commentaries for ABC Radio's Perspectives. From1990: "The  
Reagan-Bush team did more than just support dictatorial rule around the  
world. It helped foster a climate of dictatorship at home." In 1994, on  
the Gulf War: "Nobody in his right mind would incinerate or blow up  
innocent children, but that's exactly what the United Nation's said that  
American bombs did in Iraq."
<DD>Downs had quite a conspiratorial view of the discredited October  
Surprise theory, which he said "has tentacles that reach deep into the  
empire of Manuel Noriega, into the scandal at BCCI, and into  
the...destruction of Iraq....For 11 years suspicions have grown that  
renegade intelligence officers illegally seized the American  
government....There is a growing number of reasons to believe that the  
October Surprise is true." 
<DD>Finally, Kroll noted that Downs attempted to "liken Ronald Reagan to a  
communist dictator because he entertained the idea of repealing the 22nd  
Amendment, which limits a President to two terms. While Gorbachev  
attempts `to liberalize the Soviet Union by adopting Thomas Jefferson's  
democracy,' opined Downs, Reagan `in almost mirror-like fashion,' moves  
`toward absolute rule.'"

<h2>Bright Side. Liberal Bias Admitted</h2><p>

A major media figure has conceded that liberal bias really exists. On the May 12 Inside
Washington, host Gordon Peterson raised House Speaker Newt Gingrich's charge that the media are
in a "passive conspiracy" to help President Clinton. NPR's Nina Totenberg shot back: "I think
it's basically sour grapes....and I'm tired of politicians just sort of saying, when things go
badly for them, blaming us. It's not our fault, it's their fault." But then Evan Thomas,
Newsweek's Washington Bureau Chief, asserted: "They blame us, but this is true. There is a
liberal bias. It's demonstrable. You look at some statistics. About 85 percent of the reporters
who cover the White House vote Democratic, they have for a long time. Particularly at the
networks, at the lower levels, among the editors and the so-called infrastructure, there is a
liberal bias. There is a liberal bias at Newsweek, the magazine I work for -- most of the people
who work at Newsweek live on the upper West Side in New York and they have a liberal bias."
Thomas, however, didn't make a full confession, denying any bias with those under him: "I don't
think it's so much Washington. It's New York. You have to look at which city we're talking
about. It's where the networks are based. It's where The New York Times is based. I think the
greatest liberal bias is amongst the people who work for large, major news organizations in New
York."<p>

<h2>Verdict: Media Guilty of Apathy--Networks Aggressively Ignored the Crimes of Whitewater</h2><p>

The media elite keeps waiting for Whitewater to end.  "Is this basically the end of
Whitewater?," asked New York Times reporter Linda Greenhouse on PBS's Washington Week in Review
after the First Lady's cattle-futures press conference in 1994. "Whitewater is...sort of
diminishing, sort of fading away," predicted host Ken Bode on the same program on May 24. Just
four days later, Bode and other reporters were embarrassed when the story exploded with 24 fraud
and conspiracy convictions of President Clinton's business partners, Jim and Susan McDougal, and
Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker.

After NBC Nightly News aired only one reporter-based story in the entire three months of the
trial, anchor Tom Brokaw asked Washington Bureau Chief Tim Russert May 28, the night of the
convictions: "Alfonse D'Amato, the Republican Senator who's been running the Whitewater hearings
on Capitol Hill, has so much as admitted recently that he didn't get very far. There have been
any number of exhaustive journalistic efforts. What do we think may be out there? Anything
left?"

On CBS, Dan Rather quickly disposed of "Republican special prosecutor Kenneth Starr" and spent
15 minutes on newly discovered footage surrounding John F. Kennedy's 1963 assassination. When he
returned to the trial, Rather twice insisted "President Clinton was not charged with anything in
this trial." Reporters Scott Pelley (once) and  Rita Braver (twice) repeated that the President
was not a target of investigation. 

The convictions were a stark contrast to the stunning lack of TV coverage of the trial. A
MediaWatch analysis from February 29 to May 28 found the Big Three networks aired only 13
reporter-based Whitewater stories on their evening news shows -- an average of about four
stories per network over three months. (CNN's The World Today reported ten stories.) The three
morning shows also yawned at the story, airing only 14 reporter-based stories and five
interviews during that time. 

Other Clinton scandals continue to be ignored.  On April 5, the Los Angeles Times  broke the
story that the Clinton administration secretly encouraged Iran to send arms to the Bosnian
Muslims while Clinton publicly defended the arms embargo. CBS and NBC have not broadcast a
single evening news story. ABC aired two evening anchor briefs, CNN's The World Today, three.

The networks have yet to touch the May 2 Washington Times story of how Senate Democrats have
placed a hold on a bill reimbursing former White House Travel Office chief Billy Dale for
$500,000 in legal fees -- money he spent defending himself against the Clintons' false charges
that he was an embezzler.<p>
<h2>Setting an Example</h2><p>

While the television networks have been reluctant to cover Whitewater, the print
 media have been
much more thorough. The June 2 Washington Post ran an in-depth, front page story
 on the scandal,
focusing on the role of First Lady Hillary Clinton, concluding that: "Her public
 record suggests
conflicts with self-portrait of naivete."<p>
The nearly five-page story story by David Maraniss and Susan Schmidt looked at t
he conflict
between what Mrs. Clinton has stated and the documented record. While  most of t
he story looked
at the players involved and recounted the entire scandal, the Post prefaced the
story: "The
image is of a mere bystander, a good person victimized. But an examination of Hi
llary Clinton's
public statements suggests someone less passive in her behavior, less consistent
 in her answers,
and less committed to full disclosure than the figure in her self-portrait....He
r wording seems
alternately terse and lawyerly, providing the narrowest possible answers, and un
abashedly
political, ornamented with asides and anecdotes."  <p>

<h2>Newsbites</h2><p>


<h3>Dole's Code</h3><p>

How will the media cover Bob Dole and Bill Clinton clashing on issues? The May 23 CBS Evening
News offered a preview of how Dole is the divider while Clinton is the unifier. First, reporter
Phil Jones analyzed Dole's criticism of Clinton's veto of the partial birth abortion ban. Jones
predicted it would energize the religious right, but that it really served a more sinister
purpose: "It's also Dole campaign code. When he talks about abortion, that leads to morality.
When he talks about morality, that raises the issue of character. And that's exactly what Dole
and the Republicans want -- to force a presidential election based on Bill Clinton's character."<p>

Next, Rita Braver praised Clinton: "The White House had expected the Republicans to go negative,
but not this hard, this fast. And the President's remarks were very well thought out. He was
sending Dole a message that your remarks are not going to go unchallenged." Braver then
criticized Dole for raising the issue: "You could see the President's strategy here and that is
to tell Americans that Bob Dole is dragging the campaign into the mud and trying to divide the
country."<p>


<h3>Hands Off Clinton </h3>

The Bush campaign got lambasted over Willie Horton while the media ignored that future Vice
President Al Gore first raised Horton in a 1988 primary debate. This year, while fulminating
about a 1990 ad from Republican Jesse Helms, the media failed to dredge up the President's
relationship to the man behind the Helms ad, Dick Morris.<p>

NBC's Bob Faw warned May 7 that "every time he has run, Helms has exploited racial tension." Faw
showed a clip of the Helms' 1990 affirmative action ad, "Hands," showing a pair of white hands
crumpling up a job rejection letter: "You needed that job, and you were the best qualified. But
they had to give it to a minority."  Faw continued: "For many voters here the basic if
bedeviling question is whether a black or white challenger has a better chance against an
incumbent who in the past has played the race card and can be expected to do so again." (Black
1990 candidate Harvey Gantt won the primary again this year.) On May 5 ABC's Carla Hill played
the ad, adding: "Jesse Helms successfully played the race card against Gantt in 1990." Los
Angeles Times reporter Eric Harrison wrote May 11: "Helms unleashed a barrage of racially
inflammatory television commercials as the close contest came to an end and defeated Gantt by
six percentage points."<p>

Only reporter Lloyd Grove noted, sotto voce, in the 35th paragraph of a May 24 Washington Post
profile of Gantt: "One of his [Helms'] key advisers -- pollster Richard Morris, who has taken
credit for conceiving the so-called `Hands' spot -- is working this year for President Clinton."<p>

<h3>A Lying Shame</h3><p>

As part of NBC's week-long series on "Dishonesty in America: Lie, Cheat, Steal," the May 19
Dateline NBC aired a story on how to recognize when someone is lying. With the Clintons telling
whoppers weekly, NBC wouldn't have to go back very far to find some good examples. Instead,
reporter Sara James left an amazing impression: only Republicans lie. <p>

James interviewed Paul Eckman, a psychologist who trains law enforcement officers to detect
lies. Eckman used video of five liars to demonstrate his techniques; child murderer Susan Smith,
former Los Angeles police detective Mark Fuhrman, Oliver North, who James stated lied "in the
name of country," and Reagan national security aide John Poindexter. Closing the piece, James
showed a video of Richard Nixon denying involvement in Watergate. She stated: "Eckman is the
first to admit that many lies, especially when they come in prepared statements, are tough to
catch. As America discovered, it was far from the truth, but not even Paul Eckman knew that
Richard Nixon was lying back then." Before the James story aired, Dateline promos left the same
partisan impression, showing only Nixon and North, not the Clintons.<p>


<h3>Murdering Genius</h3><p>

The Unabomber was just a troubled soul who lost his way, said The New York Times. "Theodore
Kaczynski: Unabomb Suspect's Tortured Genius and Lost Promise" blared a May 26 front page
headline. Reporter Robert McFadden set a romanticized scene: "It was just a dusty, cobwebbed
cabin high in the Rockies, as remote as a cougar's lair. But it suited a man who had always been
alone, this genius with gifts for solitude, perseverance, secrecy and meticulousness, for
penetrating the mysteries of mathematics and the dangers of technology, but never love, never
friendship." McFadden continued: "The furnishings were the fragments of his life: the books for
companionship and the bunk for the lonely hours, the wood stove where night after night he
watched dying embers flicker visions of a wretched humanity, the typewriter where, the
authorities say, the justifications for murder had been crafted like numbered theorems." Put the
Hammer Down.<p>

Reporters constantly argue for the most expansive interpretation of the Bill of Rights. But
there's one amendment on which reporters' interpretations become very narrow -- the Second. 
Look at how Jack Ford assaulted National Rifle Association President Marion Hammer on the April
28 Today. Ford asserted: "Assault weapons. The NRA has been consistent in its opposition to any
restrictions on assault weapons. What possible compelling reason is there for private citizens
to own assault weapons?" Ford also asked, "What would you say to the mother of an inner-city
child who was killed by stray gunfire? How would you explain to that mother why the rights to
own weapons are more important than that mother's child?" Finally, he raised the now standard
media linkage, "We've seen recently that members of anti-government groups, militia groups, have
been linked, if not directly, in some ways philosophically, with the NRA. Are you concerned
about that?"<p>


<h3>Stacked Reporting</h3><p>

Do you wonder if reporters make up facts or use questionable information to support their own
views? ABC's Lynn Sherr did in an April 26 20/20 in which she argued "the number one way to get
sexy, in many women's minds, is with larger breasts."<p>

But Washington Post pollster Richard Morin revealed May 19 that Sherr ignored ABC's own
scientific poll conducted specifically for the story. Instead she relied on an unscientific Self
magazine survey which found that half the women felt their bosoms were "inadequate." In fact,
the ABC poll found only 23 percent had "ever" wished their breasts were a different size. Asked
by Barbara Walters whether breast size is most important to men, Sherr explained that the ABC
poll found that "It's the face first, breasts come a close second." Really? Morin noticed that
at eight percent, breasts came in a distant fourth place.<p>


<h3>Park Panic</h3><p>

As summer approached the media offered a barrage of stories decrying the condition of the
national parks and laying the blame at the feet of the Republican Congress.  The Los Angeles
Times led the charge with a May 14 story titled, "Tapped-Out National Parks Turn to Corporations
for Aid." Staff writer D'Jamila Salem began: "As Congress pulls the purse strings tighter, the
National Park Service is turning to corporate America for funds to refurbish and maintain many
of the nation's parks and memorials, including the Washington Monument....The National Park
Service has a 1996 budget of $1.32 billion, down $67 million from 1995." But the Heritage
Foundation's Scott Hodge told MediaWatch the Park Service's budget has risen $79 million from
$1.488 billion in 1993 to an estimated $1.567 billion for 1996.<p>

NBC's Bryant Gumbel opened a May 24 Today interview: "On Close Up this morning, our national
parks are in a bit of trouble...Budget cutbacks have left many more understaffed struggling to
cope with the needs of visitors." Talking to two park service officials, Gumbel queried, "How
much have you had to cut those regular levels of seasonal employees?" And, "To what extent do
you think safety has been compromised at your facility as a result of the cutbacks?" He asked,
"Are you saying that when people say they want lower taxes, maybe they don't think about what
happens to their parks?" Finally, he took a jab at Congress, "Do you think Congress, the people
on Capitol Hill, have any true appreciation of the dire straits the parks are in?"<p>

On the May 27 World News Tonight, ABC's Tom Foreman brought some reason to the process. He
observed that while visitors to the parks have been increasing, "It is worth noting the National
Parks have been spared some of the major budget cuts...This year the park budget actually went
up $4 million. No wonder some in Congress feel the park service is crying wolf."<p>


<h3>Skip the Other Side</h3><p>

"A balanced report, in some cases, may no longer be the most effective or even the most
informative. Indeed, it can be debilitating. Can we afford to wait for our audience to come to
its conclusions? I think not." Apparently this policy, written six years ago by CNN producer
Teya Ryan, continues today. <p>

On the May 8 The World Today, anchor Linden Soles scared viewers: "It's elementary. We need to
breathe to stay alive. But what if the air is so dirty it could kill you? That's what happens to
tens of thousands of Americans each year, according to a new report. It comes as environmental
regulations are under fire in Congress." Reporter Skip Loescher opened: "Depending on where you
live and your medical condition stepping out for a little fresh air may not be a good idea. In
fact, according to a new report what's in the air we breathe may be prematurely killing us."
Loescher offered soundbites from a press conference by the Natural Resources Defense Council,
the author of the new report. David Hawkins, from the NRDC claimed 64,000 prematurely died from
heart and lung disease brought on by particulate air pollution. Acting like an NRDC spokesman,
Loescher simply lifted numbers from the report. "The number of premature deaths in some cities
is startling. In Los Angeles, for example, the report cites more than 5,800. More than 400 early
deaths are estimated in New York..." Nowhere did Loescher offer an opposing side to counter the
NRDC claims.<p>


<h3>Reinventing Mathematics</h3><p>

Part of the Clinton Administration's attempt to paint itself as moderate involves "reinventing
government," fostering the idea that they are making government smaller. Peter Jennings played
along on the May 14 World News Tonight. He delivered this finger wag to anti-government folks:
"There are a couple of things about government which may surprise you. The federal government is
only about three percent larger than it was more than thirty years ago. And the number of
federal employees is about the same as it was in the 1950s." <p>

Office of Management and Budget (OMB) figures for federal employees have indeed been relatively
stable at around 2 million over the last thirty years. But in the February American Spectator,
Byron York pointed out that most of the Clinton-era cuts were from a Cold War drawdown begun by
the Bush Administration and the closing of the Resolution Trust Corporation: "Add up just those
two areas-Defense and the RTC-and you get 140,800 jobs, or 90 percent of the cuts claimed by
Clinton and Gore. That means the administration has cut a grand total of 16,000 jobs -- less
than one percent of the workforce." The actual scope and power of the federal government is
measured most directly by the federal spending level. According to Edwin Rubenstein's The Right
Data, OMB figures showed federal spending grew 173 percent in real terms between 1965 and 1992.
Hardly the benign "three percent larger" federal government of Jennings' imagination. <p>


<h3>Israel's Gingrich?--Defining Fear and Extremism</h3><p>


An upset election occurs, turning the media conventional wisdom on its head as a conservative
politician wins. The media dismiss the win as unsubstantive, the product of fear and angry white
men. They throw terms like "hardliner" and "right-winger" at the winner and accuse him of
inspiring violence with his rhetoric.<p>

In 1994, the target of this media barrage was Newt Gingrich. In 1996 it was Israel's new Prime
Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Prior to the vote, on the May 27 CBS This Morning, Jesse Schulman
set up the choice: "Shimon Peres, statesman of the old school...talking about the big picture,
about Israel's place in a changing Middle East, about hopes for peace, versus Benjamin
Netanyahu, the slickest TV politician in the business, master of the soundbite, master of the
cheap shot."<p>

Others picked up on Netanyahu's American conservative connections. That night, NBC's Martin
Fletcher tried some guilt by association: "[Netanyahu] has American politician written all over
his campaign. That's thanks to an American political consultant, who has advised conservatives
like Senator Al D'Amato and Jesse Helms. The consultant told Netanyahu to stick to one simple,
negative theme: fear."<p>

The media stuck to a simple message, increasingly invoking the fear theme as the returns became
clearer. Good Morning America anchor Charlie Gibson made the charge on the May 30 broadcast:
"Yesterday's watershed vote, so important to the peace process in the Middle East, has been
called a choice between Israel's hopes and fears, and it now appears, though the results are
still oh so close, that Israel may have voted its fears. Benjamin Netanyahu, who vowed to apply
brakes to the peace process, if not reverse it entirely, is ahead in the vote count."<p>

Later on the same show, New York Times reporter Judith Miller declared that "it was both a
victory for the forces of fear and militancy." Just like Newt Gingrich in 1994, Bibi Netanyahu
was accused of running a campaign not on important issues but on base emotions. <p>

In 1995, Gingrich and House Republicans were accused of inspiring the Oklahoma City bombing. In
1996, Netanyahu was charged with creating the environment for Yitzhak Rabin's assassination. On
the May 31 CBS This Morning, Harry Smith asked Middle East analyst Fouad Ajami: "Let's talk
about his words for a second. Because it's not that many months ago that a lot of people were
accusing Bibi Netanyahu of fanning the flames of the Israeli right, of setting the rhetorical
tone for Rabin's assassination."<p>

Netanyahu, like Gingrich, was subjected to extreme labeling, but their opponents, Peres and the

terrorists attack an Israeli army convoy and the Israeli government appears headed for a major
shift to the hardline right." The next night he announced, "Right-wing hardliner Benjamin
Netanyahu is declared Israel's new Prime Minister."<p>

On Today May 31, NBC's Ron Allen worried: "The transition seems already underway. This morning
Netanyahu continued talks that could create the most right-wing Orthodox religious government
here ever. During the count, Netanyahu has been silent, leaving aides to offer reassurances that
nothing radical is about to happen."  <p>

<h2>Defining Fear and Extremism: Israel's Gingrich?</h2>
<P>
<DD>An upset election occurs, turning the media conventional wisdom on its  
head as a conservative politician wins. The media dismiss the win as  
unsubstantive, the product of fear and angry white men. They throw terms  
like "hardliner" and "right-winger" at the winner and accuse him of  
inspiring violence with his rhetoric.
<DD>In 1994, the target of this media barrage was Newt Gingrich. In 1996 it  
was Israel's new Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Prior to the vote,  
on the May 27 CBS This Morning, Jesse Schulman set up the choice:  
"Shimon Peres, statesman of the old school...talking about the big  
picture, about Israel's place in a changing Middle East, about hopes for  
peace, versus Benjamin Netanyahu, the slickest TV politician in the  
business, master of the soundbite, master of the cheap shot."
Others picked up on Netanyahu's American conservative connections. That  
night, NBC's Martin Fletcher tried some guilt by association:  
"[Netanyahu] has American politician written all over his campaign.  
That's thanks to an American political consultant, who has advised  
conservatives like Senator Al D'Amato and Jesse Helms. The consultant  
told Netanyahu to stick to one simple, negative theme: fear."
The media stuck to a simple message, increasingly invoking the fear  
theme as the returns became clearer. Good Morning America anchor Charlie  
Gibson made the charge on the May 30 broadcast: "Yesterday's watershed  
vote, so important to the peace process in the Middle East, has been  
called a choice between Israel's hopes and fears, and it now appears,  
though the results are still oh so close, that Israel may have voted its  
fears. Benjamin Netanyahu, who vowed to apply brakes to the peace  
process, if not reverse it entirely, is ahead in the vote count."
Later on the same show, New York Times reporter Judith Miller declared  
that "it was both a victory for the forces of fear and militancy." Just  
like Newt Gingrich in 1994, Bibi Netanyahu was accused of running a  
campaign not on important issues but on base emotions. 20
In 1995, Gingrich and House Republicans were accused of inspiring the  
Oklahoma City bombing. In 1996, Netanyahu was charged with creating the  
environment for Yitzhak Rabin's assassination. On the May 31 CBS This  
Morning, Harry Smith asked Middle East analyst Fouad Ajami: "Let's talk  
about his words for a second. Because it's not that many months ago that  
a lot of people were accusing Bibi Netanyahu of fanning the flames of  
the Israeli right, of setting the rhetorical tone for Rabin's  
assassination."
<DD>Netanyahu, like Gingrich, was subjected to extreme labeling, but their  
opponents, Peres and the Democrats, were almost never tagged left wing,  
extreme or radical. On the May 30 CBS Evening News, Dan Rather suggested  
"Serious questions about the future of Middle East peace as Lebanese  
terrorists attack an Israeli army convoy and the Israeli government  
appears headed for a major shift to the hardline right." The next night  
he announced, "Right-wing hardliner Benjamin Netanyahu is declared  
Israel's new Prime Minister."
<DD>On Today May 31, NBC's Ron Allen worried: "The transition seems already  
underway. This morning Netanyahu continued talks that could create the  
most right-wing Orthodox religious government here ever. During the  
count, Netanyahu has been silent, leaving aides to offer reassurances  
that nothing radical is about to happen."

<h2>Stand for More Money--Media Promote Liberal Rally</h2><p>


Liberal advocates of increased welfare spending used kids to advance their own interests through
the Children's Defense Fund's (CDF) June 1 Stand for Children march. And the media bought the
facade. Time set the tone with a June 3 story headlined "The Children's Crusade: A '60s style
campaign aims to put kids first in this year's budget battles and the presidential race."
Elizabeth Gleick managed to squeeze only two conservatives into five pages as she painted the
CDF as a group working to fix the "disconnect between what Americans say they want for children
and what they actually do for them." Joan Lunden endorsed the message of organizer Marian Wright
Edelman during a May 30 Good Morning America interview: "It seems like there's more money being
spent for the environment or for the gun lobby...the federal government's talking about turning
over a lot of the social programs to the states...What do you think is the best way to approach
this?" As Edelman responded, "The first thing is we've got to make a commitment," Lunden chimed
in "Yeah, yeah." Edelman then charged that march sponsors "will no longer tolerate the neglect
and abandonment of our children or the massive budget cuts or the dismantlement of the safety
net." To which Lunden gushed: "Gotta get the message out there and get people to rally around
one of our most important problems." Even pieces that included a conservative view still spun
for the marchers. On the May 30 CBS Evening News, Wyatt Andrews talked to kids at a teen center,
noting "the fear they express and the troubling state of kids in general is the reason" for the
march. "A massive rally for children sounds like one of the least controversial ideas in
history, and yet conservative critics believe this march is just a backdrop masking a liberal
agenda." After a clip of the Heritage Foundation's Robert Rector, he showed a teen saying "I
don't want our future to be messed up. I want to, like, have a nice environment and live
peacefully." NBC's John Palmer concluded his June 1 Nightly News story with the marcher's spin:
"As the rally ended, parents were urged to go back home and fight for increased public funding
for programs that help children and to carry the message that children should come first."  <p>

<h2>The Dick Morris Echo Chamber--Reporters Pile "Extremist" Labels on Republicans, But Spared
Democrats in 1993 and 1994</h2><p>

At the dawn of the Clinton era, the Democratic Party dominated both the executive and
legislative branches. Within months, Democrats peeled away  restrictions on abortion on demand,
pushed for openly gay soldiers in the military, raised taxes to historically high levels, and
promoted universally subsidized health care. Two years later, in the gloomy days after the
Republican sweep of Congress in 1994, Bill Clinton sought the advice of political consultant
Dick Morris, who urged him to "triangulate" between the extremes of the ascendant conservative
Republicans and the liberals in his own party. Would reporters label liberal Democrats
"extreme"? To analyze the media's use of labels to describe the political parties, MediaWatch
analysts used the Nexis news data retrieval system to search for the word "extreme" within 25
words of "Republican" or "Democrat" in the three news magazines (Time, Newsweek, and U.S. News &
World Report) and USA Today from January 1, 1993 to May 31, 1996. Analysts discovered reporters
did not use many extremist labels in 1993 and 1994 -- 41 -- but 26 of those were applied to
Republicans, compared to ten mentions of dual extremes and only five for the Democrats who ruled
both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue. But in the first 17 months of GOP control, Republicans were
described as "extreme" in 123 stories, while only 15 found "extremes" on both sides. Just two
mentioned "extreme" Democrats. USA Today's Richard Benedetto exemplified reporting on Republican
extremism on June 16, 1995: "Democrats are trying to keep a stiff upper lip as they continue to
oppose `extreme' GOP cuts." Many of these were attributed to Democrats, but more than 20 came
directly from reporters, such as Gloria Borger's March 11, 1996 U.S. News suggestion that
"taking on Buchananism would be good for Gingrich. Recall that until Buchanan surged, Gingrich
was Washington's resident extremist." The reports citing dual extremes weren't always perfectly
balanced. Witness U.S. News's Kenneth Walsh on July 31, 1995: "The President is trying to
position himself as a moderate who occupies a middle ground between liberal Democrats and
ultraconservative Republicans." A rare extreme label for Democrats came in the August 22, 1994
Newsweek, when Joe Klein hit the Clintons: "This President -- and more to the point -- the First
Lady have cultivated the most extreme Democratic health-care cultists and boycotted the
moderates of both parties." The breakdown by publication: USA Today described Republicans with
extreme terms in 14 news stories in 1993 and 1994, compared to five on dual extremes and two
touching on Democrats. More common was  Richard Benedetto on June 27, 1994: "Some analysts warn
the growing strength of conservative Christians in the GOP, and their reputation for
intolerance, will drive moderates and independents to the Democrats, and cause selection of an
extremist 1996 presidential candidate who can't win."<p>
 USA Today tossed in 62 mentions of GOP extremism in 1995-96, seven of dual extremes, and one on
 Democrats. Judy Keen and Bill Nichols found just one extreme on March 16, 1995: "Clinton wants
 to steer a middle course between traditional Democratic liberalism and `extremist' GOP budget
 cut proposals." The duo explained this "middle course" involved "using the broad theme that the
 GOP agenda is extremist, callous toward children and the poor, and cuts government more than
 the nation will tolerate."<p>
U.S. News & World Report contained four mentions of Republican extremism, three of dual
extremes, and one of Democratic extremism in 1993-94; but in 1995-96, U.S. News led the
magazines with 28 GOP extremist labels, two mentions of dual extremes and just one Democrat
extreme. Kenneth Walsh claimed on March 25, 1996: "Clinton's feuds with some allies will make it
harder to label him a liberal extremist, as George Bush in 1988 caricatured Michael Dukakis." On
October 27, 1995, Walsh happily noted: "President Clinton, playing Horatius at the bridge
against the Republican hordes, is finally winning some favorable reviews. Democrats are rallying
to his side as he defends the poor and elderly against GOP `extremism.'" Time carried five
mentions of Republican extremism, and zero mentions of dual or Democratic extremes in 1993-94,
but forwarded 21 mentions of Republican extremism in 1995-96, compared to three mentions of dual
extremes and zero of Democratic extremism. A typical mention was Robert Hughes arguing in an
August 7, 1995 cover story that to Republicans, PBS was "a carcass they can toss to their
extreme right." Newsweek was the least tilted in 1993-94, with three mentions of GOP extremism,
two of dual extremes, two of Democrats: one came in Klein's story quoted above, the other  a
Sharon Begley mention of a professional protest group called BEIRUT (Boisterous Extremists for
Insurrection Against Republicans and Other Unprincipled Thugs). But in 1995-96, the magazine
employed 22 references to GOP extremism, three mentions of dual extremes, and no example of
Democratic extremism.     Howard Fineman tapdanced around associating Republicans with Timothy
McVeigh on May 8, 1995: "the Oklahoma bombing has illuminated a once dark landscape much farther
afield: a radical fringe of militant gun owners, `hate radio' talk-show hosts, racial
extremists, and religious cultists. Their numbers are small -- and their GOP ties tenuous at
best. But their fervor is influential at the grass roots Republicans call their own." Joe Klein
cheered on November 13: "[Colin] Powell has done a great national service by confounding the
extremist publicists and fundraisers of the Republican right." On CNBC's Tim Russert May 25,
Time's Jeffrey Birnbaum told of an adversary relationship with the White House, which saw
reporters as a group "that was there to be manipulated....the conduit for their talking points."
That's all too accurate. The evidence shows reporters aren't stenographers for the White House
-- they're stenographers for White House political consultant. Klein's January 30, 1995 column
didn't count: "[House Minority Whip David] Bonior's reputation of extreme decency and hard work
has saved him."What didn't count was Gloria Borger's April 11, 1994 plaint about White House
inquiries into the hiring of Republican prosecutor Jay Stephens to investigate Whitewater: "It
has swung from a stubborn refusal to disclose to the current extreme of apologizing for
perfectly appropriate behavior."  At least Richard Stengel more evenly presented dual extremes
on February 5, 1996, saying the "triangulation" strategy of "steering between the extremes of
the House Republicans and the liberals in Clinton's own party -- has had the counterintuitive
effect of making Clinton seem like a 'conviction politician.'" On December 19, 1994, Newsweek's
Lucy Howard and Carla Koehl did note an accusation of liberal extremism in the Republican Party,
quoting a flier distributed by "conservative activists" warning of Rep. Susan Molinari's
(R-N.Y.) "extreme pro-abortion agenda," which the reporters immediately followed by noting:
"House sources say that the strident attack angered members, who thought it was unfair." On
November 20, 1995, Joe Klein tried to cast himself in the "radical middle" by scoffing at
Democrats who claimed Colin Powell's refusal to run for President as proof of Republican
extremism: "The witless husk of the party that remains is as intolerant of heresy -- on
abortion, racial gerrymandering, the sanctity of teacher unions -- as any of Pat Robertson's
wing-nuts are." <p>

<center><h2>"Moderates" Vote Left--Democrats Backed Since 1976</center></h2><p>


A survey of his colleagues by a White House correspondent has confirmed that the Freedom Forum
poll, showing 89 percent of Washington reporters voted for Clinton and 50 percent identify
themselves as Democrats, but just four percent as Republicans, matches how they've voted since
1976.<p>

For his new book, Feeding the Beast: The White House Versus the Press, U.S. News & World Report
White House correspondent Kenneth Walsh personally polled 28 of his White House colleagues. His
findings: "In 1992, nine respondents voted for Clinton, two for George Bush, and one for
independent Ross Perot. Three said they had not voted for anyone, and one reporter wrote in the
name of former Massachusetts Senator Paul Tsongas. In 1988, twelve voted for Democrat Michael
Dukakis, only one for Bush, and three did not vote for a presidential candidate. In 1984, ten
voted for Democrat Walter Mondale, no one admitted voting for Ronald Reagan, and four said they
had not voted for a presidential candidate."<p>

In a May 10 appearance on the Fox Morning News Walsh maintained "that the overwhelming number of
reporters" he polled "identify themselves as moderates." Walsh insisted reporters don't have a
liberal bias, "I think it's more just an engine of anti-incumbency." But that's not what his
poll found the last time a Democratic incumbent faced re-election: "In 1980, eight voted for
Democratic incumbent Jimmy Carter, two voted for Ronald Reagan, four voted for independent
candidate John Anderson, and three did not vote. In 1976, eleven voted for Carter and two for
Republican incumbent Gerald Ford."<p>

Walsh's survey included reporters from all the major media: the four TV networks, the Los
Angeles Times, New York Times, USA Today, and The Washington Post; Copley, Cox, Hearst,
Knight-Ridder, plus Newsweek, Time and U.S. News & World Report.  <p>

<h2>MRC-Study from July 1996 Media Watch</h2>
<p>
<h4>Medicare: The Story with 1,060 Errors</h4>
<p>
<dd>The Health Program That Grows by Leaps and Bounds Mysteriously Described 
as "Cut"
<p>
<dd>No subject inspires more  daily journalistic fabrication than the 
federal budget. For the last 15 years, as federal spending mushroomed, 
journalists told a story echoing liberal economist John Kenneth 
Galbraith,  of a squalid public sector starved of its necessary funds. 
No program benefited more from the statist illusions of baseline 
budgeting than Medicare, which reportedly suffered "deep cuts" as it 
expanded -- 72 percent in the Bush years, for example.
<p>
<dd>In the last 18 months, reporters have made Medicare "cuts" an essential 
part of its method of underlining the "extremism" of the Republican 
Congress. The GOP's balanced-budget plan called for a $270 billion 
reduction in projected Medicare increases over seven years (with 
spending per recipient scheduled to increase from $4,800 to $7,100), but 
"cuts" remained the most popular paradigm of reporting.
<p>
<dd>To determine the accuracy of Medicare coverage, MediaWatch analysts 
reviewed 1,134 news stories in three newspapers (The New York Times, The 
Washington Post, USA Today) and three news magazines (Newsweek, Time, 
U.S. News & World Report) from January 1, 1995 to June 30, 1996. 
Employing the Nexis news data retrieval system to secure every news 
mention of "Medicare" within 10 words of "cut," "reduce," "slash," 
"scale back," and "savings," analysts found 1,060 examples of 
journalists describing Medicare "cuts."
<p>
<dd>Analysts counted multiple references within stories, but only references 
to overall Medicare spending growth, and did not include references to 
specifics, such as smaller reimbursements to doctors and hospitals. Also 
omitted were references to "saving" Medicare, which do not refer to 
spending. Analysts did include descriptions that did not match the 
search terms ("gut," "trim," "shrink," "chop," "slice," "curtail").
<p>
<dd> Other less harsh and inaccurate terms were also used. References to 
"savings" were most common, with 439 mentions. "Cuts in the growth" of 
Medicare spending drew 347 uses, and "cuts in projected spending" 
appeared 115 times. But the 901 uses of these terms were outnumbered by 
the 1,060 uses of "cut" variants. In this sample of stories inaccurate 
terminology drew more than half (54 percent) of journalistic 
declarations of Medicare's up-or-down fiscal fate.
<p>
<dd>Even the more accurate terms were garbled reactions to the dominant 
baseline-budgeting news paradigm. After all, how informative is the term 
"savings" when spending will increase by seven percent instead of ten 
percent? "Cuts in growth" and "cuts in projected spending" are 
interesting synonyms for a seven percent increase, especially when these 
terms were modified to sound harsher by reporters: "unreasonably large 
savings," "deep cuts in projected spending," "massive reductions in 
growth." To break it down by publication:
<p>
<dd>In 39 stories, Newsweek contained 24 mentions of "cuts," and only 11 
more accurate terms: five of "savings," five of "cuts in growth," and 
one "cut in projected spending." The January 8, 1996 "Corporate Killers" 
cover story warned: "Congress's budget debate -- and possible cuts in 
programs like Medicare and Medicaid -- feeds fears that the social 
safety net is about to be savaged."
<p>
<dd>Out of 63 stories, Time employed 49 descriptions of "cuts," to 20 uses 
of "cuts in growth," nine of "savings," and two of "cuts in projected 
spending." The May 15, 1995 "The Week" news summary read: "The 
President's strategists were not about to offer Republicans a hand with 
their balanced-budget/tax-cut promises by agreeing to deep slashes in 
Medicare." Richard Lacayo wrote on February 12, 1996 that a flat tax 
"could mean either a higher deficit or even heavier spending cuts in 
such places as Medicare."
<p>
<dd>U.S. News & World Report's 69 stories included 47 "cut" terms to 55 of 
the more accurate terms -- the only source  to tip slightly in 
accuracy's direction. The stories featured 29 references to "cuts in 
growth," 21 to "savings," and five to "cuts in projected spending." A 
March 13, 1995 budget story reported: "Among big-ticket programs, 
Medicare, the health care program for the elderly, and Medicaid, for the 
poor, both came in for major cuts."
<p>
<dd>The New York Times filed 508 stories matching the search terms, with 386 
references to "cuts." Reports of "savings" came on 144 occasions, "cuts 
in growth" on 112, and "cuts in projected spending" on 76. On May 11, 
1995, reporter David Sanger wrote: "But when it came to the details, 
they balked at many of the most extreme cuts, from the deepest slashes 
in Medicare to the elimination of the Commerce Department."
<p>
<dd>On October 27, the Times reported a controversy over its poll question: 
"If you had to choose, would you prefer balancing the budget or 
preventing Medicare from being significantly cut?" Not only did media 
outlets err in news stories, then they erred in their polls and in the 
news stories reporting the poll results.
<p>
<dd>In 256 stories, USA Today carried 157 mentions of "cuts," compared to 63 
of "savings," 56 of "cuts in growth," and 12 of "cuts in projected 
spending." Reporter William M. Welch suggested on May 10, 1995 the 
Republican budget would "make huge cuts in Medicare and Medicaid." 
Despite the 157 boo-boos, USA Today actually printed a correction on 
September 6, 1995: "In its Thursday edition, USA Today incorrectly 
states that Republicans have proposed reducing Medicare spending by $270 
billion. Under the Republican reform proposal to ensure that the program 
remains solvent, Medicare spending over the next seven years increases." 
<p>
<dd>The Washington Post led the survey with 397 uses of "cuts" and its 
variants in 370 stories, contrasted by 197 references to "savings," 125 
to "cuts in growth," and 19 to "cuts in projected spending." An October 
22, 1995 headline charged: "Critics Say Huge Medicare Cut Will Not Heal 
System as GOP Predicts." But the emblematic Post error came in reporter 
Howard Kurtz's attempt to correct a Clinton ad on February 7, 1996: 
"What the ads don't say is that Clinton has also proposed to cut 
Medicare spending, albeit less than the GOP." Kurtz's story, as well as 
the sample as a whole, suggests print reporters are hardly the most 
reliable judges of accuracy, even on the most basic budgetary truths.

<p>
<h4>Slow Out of the Gate on Filegate</h4>
<p>
Networks Criticize Republicans for Aggressive Investigations of 
Wrongdoing
<p>
<dd>After some initial reluctance, the networks eventually picked up the 
news that the White House had improperly obtained FBI files. But instead 
of launching their own investigations, they selectively ran revelations 
uncovered by others.
<p>
<dd>The White House admitted on June 7 collecting FBI reports on 338 GOP 
officials. ABC, CBS and CNN failed to mention the revelation that night. 
NBC's Tom Brokaw did a brief item. ABC aired its first story the next 
day after Bob Dole raised the Watergate comparison. Over on NBC, anchor 
Brian Williams painted Dole as the bad guy: "The politics of Campaign 
'96 are getting very ugly, very early. Today, Bob Dole accused the White 
House of using the FBI to wage war against its political enemies."
<p>
<dd>Three days later only ABC reported that FBI procdures were violated and 
the next day, June 12, ABC and NBC didn't bother noting that President 
Clinton apologized. On June 13 the networks were silent though the 
Senate announced hearings would be held, the FBI began an overhaul of 
procedures, and the New York Post reported that Anthony Marceca, who got 
the files, had ties to Democratic politicians.
<p>
<dd>On June 14 FBI Director Louis Freeh charged the White House with 
"egregious violations of privacy." All four did stories, but the day 
after this critical report that contradict-ed the White House claims, 
only CBS touched the subject.
<p>
<dd>"There's no question that the press initially blew this story," 
Washington Post media reporter Howard Kurtz declared on the June 16 Fox 
News Sunday. Why? There was a "feeling that...a political snooping 
operation was not the kind of thing they expected from the Clinton White 
House, whereas if hundreds of files had been obtained by Ed Meese in the 
Reagan administration on Democrats, I think this story would have 
rocketed to the front page." But that failed to prod his colleagues. No 
network noted that day's Washington Post report that, in contradiction 
to White House claims, the Secret Service said they did not produce the 
list.
<p>
<dd>Instead, CBS painted the Clintons as victims. When the Senate issued its 
June 18 report on its Travel Office investigation, Dan Rather intoned: 
"The more than year-long investigation ended almost the way it began: A 
Republican offensive targeted First Lady Hillary Clinton. Democrats 
claim that it's an all-out election-year political smear-attack."
Weeks later abuses of pow-er still failed to raise concern. The July 6 
Los Angeles Times reported that Marceca "learn-ed from his own 
background file the names of two women who made critical comments about 
him to the FBI. After seeing the file, Marceca sued the two women for 
defamation." Network coverage? Zilch.

<h4>Contract Attacked, But...Families First Favored</h4>
<p>
<dd>NBC doesn't know what to think about the Contract with America's 
political appeal, but in 1994 they denounced its content while providing 
a more favorable forum this year for the Democratic platform.
<p>
<dd>House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt appeared on the June 24 Today to 
discuss his Families First agenda. Katie Couric asked: "Speaker Gingrich 
and company's Contract with America was ultimately rejected by the 
majority of Americans and few people believe it was really behind the 
GOP sweep of the congressional elections in 1994, so why are Democrats 
trying the same approach?"
<p>
<dd>But 45 minutes later reporter Joe Johns had a different view: "The new 
Democratic agenda echoes a successful GOP strategy. In 1994, Republicans 
unveiled the Contract with America, which framed their national agenda 
in the weeks before the elections."
<p>
<dd>Whatever its public appeal, NBC panned the Contract when the Republicans 
unveiled it on September 27, 1994. Anchor Tom Brokaw announced: "GOP 
congressional candidates were summoned to Washington and given a battle 
plan. However, as NBC's Lisa Myers tells us tonight, it is long on 
promises but short on sound premises."
<p>
<dd>Myers lambasted it with five condemnations. After saying it called for 
tax cuts and a balanced budget, Myers charged that "an independent 
budget expert called it standard political bunk." She let a Democrat tag 
it "a big fraud" and then she stated the plan "fell hundreds of billions 
of dollars short of balancing the budget." Myers allowed Gingrich to 
defend the term limits plank, but only to use his response ("I don't 
think you're going to say to everybody who's been here 12 years, `You 
know, this is your last term'") as a foil for her closing sentence: "And 
politicians wonder why voters are cynical."
<p>
<dd>The networks went much easier on the Democrats. On the June 23 CBS 
Evening News John Roberts relayed, without any critical comment: "The 
Families First agenda includes higher paychecks, welfare reform, college 
tuition tax credits, better health care, retirement security and safer 
neighborhoods." A Nightly News piece by NBC's Johns was balanced, saying 
only the proposal was "short on specifics" without attacking any of the 
planks. Gingrich would have appreciated similar treatment.

<P>
<H4>Coia and the Mafia</H4>
<P>
<DD>Both Newsweek and Time have filed stories detailing the interesting 
relationship between President Clinton and Arthur Coia, head of the 
Laborers International Union of North America. The Justice Department's 
suspension of a federal takeover of the union coincided with generous 
donations to Clinton from both Coia and the union.
<P>
<DD>Newsweek's Michael Isikoff and Daniel Klaidman were first on the story 
in the May 20 issue, noting the union has given more than $3 million to 
the Democrats since 1991. The June 24 Time story by reporter George 
Church suggested the relationship seemed to pay off for Coia: "After 
three months of negotiations, however, the Justice Department persuaded 
the union to sign a consent decree acknowledging Mob influence and 
conceding to court-appointed officers. But the department agreed to hold 
off filing the decree...The deal left Coia on the job even though the 
original complaint described him as `associated with and controlled and 
influenced by organized-crime figures.' Those are documentable 
facts...Did Justice make a deal because of Coia's White House 
connections?" Church added: "The unprecedented agreement dismayed some 
investigators in the field, who had spent years building the case 
against the union."
<P>
<DD>Church also noted: "Though there is no evidence of a White 
House-engineered fix, the laborers' lavish donations to the Democratic 
Party and Coia's frequent appearances at the White House -- as well as 
deputy chief of staff Harold Ickes' past life as a lawyer for the 
Laborers -- may hand the Republicans a campaign issue."

<h2>Revolving Door, from the July 1996 Media Watch</h2>
<p>
<h4>Chancellor's Last Spin</h4>
<p>
<dd>On July 12 NBC News veteran John Chancellor, who anchored NBC Nightly 
News from 1970 to 1982, passed away at age 68. For two years during the 
Johnson administration, Chancellor served as Director of the Voice of 
America. His death generated a series of tributes to his fairness and 
impartiality from his media colleagues.
<p>
<dd>On the July 13 NBC Nightly News, for instance, anchor Brian Williams 
observed of the man who delivered commentary until his 1993 retirement: 
"He was a role model for all who care about truth, justice and fairness. 
John Chancellor died last night of cancer, two days short of his 69th 
birthday. He helped define what TV news should be." Washington Post 
reporter Howard Kurtz recalled that Chancellor "called himself a man of 
the `extreme center.'"
<p>
<dd>"He dealt in facts," asserted former NBC News President Michael Gartner 
in a July 16 USA Today column. "For his last ten years at NBC, he 
delivered 90-second commentaries three nights a week....At dinner one 
night, I remarked that he got more facts into 90 seconds than we could 
get into the rest of Nightly News in 21 minutes."  Here's a look at some 
of those "fact"-based commentaries:
<p>
<dd>April 17, 1990: "The overall tax burden for Americans, federal, state, 
and local, is actually quite low....The fact is Americans could pay more 
taxes and the country wouldn't go down the tube. Taxpayers don't believe 
this because they are being conned by the politicians...The truth is 
that the United States needs higher taxes and can afford them. Some 
political leaders are now starting to say that, but until more say it, 
the country will remain in trouble."
<p>
<dd>November 20, 1990: "Some say Ronald Reagan won the Cold War by spending 
so much on defense that the Kremlin went bankrupt trying to keep up. 
That won't wash. During Reagan's presidency the United States itself 
became a bankrupt country."
<p>
<dd>August 21, 1991, on the Soviet Union: "It's short of soap, so there are 
lice in hospitals. It's short of pantyhose, so women's legs go bare. 
It's short snowsuits, so babies stay home in winter....The problem isn't 
communism; nobody even talked about communism this week. The problem is 
shortages."
<p>
<dd>April 30, 1992, after the riots in Los Angeles: "It's not a big surprise 
that the jury in suburban Simi Valley sided with the white policemen. 
Just as it's no surprise that the blacks in downtown Los Angeles rioted 
and people died....Politicians have fanned these flames with code words 
about `welfare queens,' `equal opportunity,' and `quotas.' Language 
designed to turn whites against blacks. With two-party politics that 
favored the rich and hurt everyone else."
<p>
<dd>March 12, 1992, a year after the Gulf War: "Greenpeace, the public 
interest organization, believes that the Iraqi death toll, civilian and 
military, before and after the war, may be as high as 198,000. Allied 
military dead are counted in the low hundreds. The disparity is huge and 
somewhat embarrassing. And that's commentary for this evening, Tom."
Election night, 1992, looking back at the Republican convention: "I 
think that the convention -- and certainly all the polling data 
indicates this -- offended a lot of women, offended a lot of people in 
the country who thought it was too religious and too hard-edged."

<h2>News Bites, from the July 1996 Media Watch</h2>
<p>
<b>Humorless Howard.</b>
<p>
To read Washington Post media writer Howard Kurtz, one might think Bill 
Clinton was some poor fat kid getting ridiculed on the playground. In a 
June 4 story he claimed Clinton "has drawn a phenomenal amount of 
personal ridicule" from comedians, "Unflattering images -- of a 
philandering, draft-dodging, pot-smoking, cheeseburger-chomp-ing, 
self-indulgent finagler -- reverberate through the media." And 
"Republicans have concluded that barbed humor can be a particularly 
sharp weapon." Unfortunately, Kurtz did not quantify his feelings by 
consulting experts. On June 24, the Center for Media and Public Affairs 
released the results of its study detailing jokes told by David 
Letterman, Jay Leno, and Conan O'Brien. Since the end of the primaries, 
"the latenight comics have told twice as many jokes about Dole as they 
have about Clinton."
<p>
<b>Richer Under Clinton.</b>
<p>
The June 20 New York Times headline declared: "Income Disparity Between 
Poorest and Richest Rises." Reporter Steven Holmes relayed a Census 
Bureau finding that "during the first two years" of Clinton, "the share 
of national income earned by the top 5 percent of householdsgrew at a 
faster rate than during the eight years of the Reagan administration, 
which was often characterized as favoring the rich."
Where were the networks? On March 5, 1992, when the Times ran a similar 
piece, CBS Evening News anchor Dan Rather announced: "In America in the 
1980s, what former President Reagan and those who support him call the 
Reagan Revolution put more money in the pockets of the rich. We already 
knew that. But a new study indicates that those who did best of all by 
far were the very richest of the rich." This time CBS was silent, as 
were ABC and CNN. The news made the June 20 NBC Nightly News, but anchor 
Brian Williams didn't blame Clinton, but corporate America: "Much of the 
blame for the income gap has been laid on vast changes in the job 
market, a job market that keeps shrinking. A while back corporate 
f pumping the story up."
<p>
<b>The Invisible McDougals.</b>
<p>
Two recent morning show interviewers demonstrated the convictions of the 
President's Whitewater business partners on multiple felony counts 
hasn't changed the media's tune. On the June 5 Good Morning America, 
ABC's Elizabeth Vargas interviewed Michael Chertoff, Republican Counsel 
to the Whitewater investigation. She inquired: "It would seem very 
natural that Hillary Clinton's fingerprints would be on her own billing 
records. Is this at all significant?" Throughout the interview Vargas 
sounded like a White House flack: "But, Mr. Chertoff, Mrs. Clinton 
freely admits she examined those documents back in 1992. How do you know 
these prints aren't several years old?"
<p>
CBS This Morning substitute host Erin Moriarty spent three straight days 
using the White House spin to challenge guests on June 18-20. 
Questioning  Rep. Susan Molinari (R-N.Y.), Democratic activist Lynn 
Cutler, and David Maraniss of The Washington Post, Moriarty asked 
nothing but pro-Clinton questions. She asked Molinari: "But let's be 
honest here. I mean, this is an election year. How much of this, as the 
White House of course says, is just a matter of the Republicans piling 
on in a presidential election year?" She asked Maraniss: "We're talking 
about transactions that occurred a decade ago. I mean, can't some of 
this just be simply forgetfulness?" The next day, Moriarty tried to 
dismiss Filegate in a question to Rep. William Clinger (R-Pa.): "Are you 
concerned that this will mean a number of redundant investigations into 
the same matter?"
<p>
Schneider's Wishful Thinking.On the June 14 Inside Politics, CNN polling 
analyst Bill Schneider trumpeted,  as the death knell of conservative 
activism, Virginia Sen. John Warner's decisive win over Jim Miller in a 
GOP primary: "This week the voters struck a resounding blow against 
political correctness --  not political correctness of the left, 
political correctness of the right." Schneider reported Warner took 
"moderate positions on abortion and gun control" and "refused to support 
radical right nominees of his own party, like Oliver North in 1994 and 
former Moral Majority official Mike Farris in 1993."
<p>
According to Schneider, activists representing term limits, gun owners 
and Christian conservatives were rejected by even the Republican 
faithful in Virginia. "Warner didn't just beat Miller, he wiped the 
floor with him. Warner won everywhere, even in solidly Republican 
areas...the Republican mainstream turned out to vote against him 
[Miller]."
<p>
Schneider charged conservatives were on a losing streak. "This 
represents the third defeat in a row for the right wing in Virginia. 
They couldn't win general elections in 1993 and 1994." He forgot the GOP 
made big gains in the state legislature in 1995 and elected conservative 
Gov. George Allen in 1993. Schneider also failed to mention the actual 
tone of Warner's TV ads. Some attacked Miller from the right, while 
others pitched Warner as a conservative: "Committed to common sense 
conservative principles like lower taxes, less regulation, and a 
balanced budget."
<p>
<b>It's Our Land of Hackdom Now.</b>
<p>
An article in the June 3 Newsweek by Mark Hosenball and Daniel Klaidman 
showed the Willie Horton defense is already being deployed in Campaign 
'96. Titled "Desperately Seeking the Next `Willie Horton,' the piece 
detailed what Newsweek called "part of a concerted Republican effort to 
build a `Hall of Shame' for prosecutors and judges deemed soft on 
crime...A loose network of former Republican prosecutors is searching 
for liberal jurists and lawyers, the kind who might, say, turn loose 
another Willie Horton."
<p>
Specifically, Newsweek tried to short-circuit Republican criticism of 
Janet Napolitano, a Clinton-appointed U.S. Attorney who had been one of 
Anita Hill's lawyers. Napolitano's office refused to grant a search 
warrant to postal inspectors investigating a child porn ring because she 
had a "`philosophical disagreement' with the sting operation because it 
targeted homosexual males." Oddly, while Hosenball and Klaidman decried 
this injection of politics into criminal justice, they cheered on that 
the "Justice [Department] is learning how to fight back. Using the 
lexicon of the campaign, Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick has told 
aides she wants a `rapid response' to counter charges `in the same news 
cycle.' Gorelick is even setting up a campaign-like `war room' in her 
office. In a campaign year, Justice can't afford to be totally blind."
<p>
This contrasted with Newsweek's attitude in 1992 that "Clinton, for a 
change, should pick an Attorney General who is above politics." In that 
November 23, 1992 article Newsweek's David Kaplan criticized the Justice 
Department under Ed Meese for being too political: "Meese ran a Justice 
Department that was the Land of Hackdom -- little more than an agency to 
service the needs of President Reagan and, occasionally, of the A.G. 
himself. [Meese's] four-year reign was the archetype of politics over 
conscience, ideology over law."
<p>
<b>Hyping the Hippie.</b>
<p>
When Timothy Leary died on May 31, the media lauded him as a barefoot, 
smiling hippie who spent his life dispensing wisdom and encouraging 
people to open their minds. CBS News reporter Sharyl Attkisson related 
that "the last words of the man who spent a lifetime asking questions 
[were] `Why not?'
<p>
Newsweek's David Gates gave a much more complete portrait of Leary's 
life. Gates reported June 10 that by the end of the '60s, Leary "found 
it `inconceivable' that turned-on parents wouldn't share acid with kids 
as young as 7." In 1970, he broke out of prison with the help of the 
ultra-violent leftist Weather Underground, fleeing to the Black 
Panther's "exile" camp in Algeria. Gates reported that Leary suggested 
it was a "`sacred act' to shoot cops." After being captured in 
Afghanistan, Leary informed on drug buddies to curry favor for a lighter 
sentence.
<p>
<b>Brokaw's Bias Drained Out.</b>
<p>
Why are the media perceived as biased and what are the greatest threats 
to honest information? NBC's Tom Brokaw offered novel answers  during a 
June 11 National Press Club appearance aired on C-SPAN. On bias, Brokaw 
explained: "We're out there on the cutting edge of change on a daily 
basis. That's what news is all about....The people...who are the 
recipients of that news, kind of like the status quo for the most part. 
They're comfortable. They've learned to deal with it and they don't want 
to adapt to the change. Therefore they have to learn to blame someone in 
some regard and they think therefore since we brought them the news of 
the change that somehow we are biased of favor of the change." He 
insisted: "We've worked very hard to drain the bias out of what we do."
<p>
He dismissed talk radio, saying "I think that people pretty soon get 
bored with it...I think that you'll find that a lot of these acts and a 
lot of these towns around the country will begin to dry up because it's 
so Johnny One Note and it's not very enlightening." While "they can 
still stir up an issue from time to time," to Brokaw that's not a good 
thing, it's instead "the price of free speech."
<p>
Talk radio is not the only non-mainstream media source that disturbed 
the NBC anchor: "If you don't go on the net and look at the political 
web sites, then you're missing something, because that's an unfiltered 
access to people out there, and there's some outrageous stuff that is 
going out on the Internet right now -- claims that are being made by 
these special interest groups, all the way across the political 
spectrum, from the far left to the far right." It seems that in Brokaw's 
world, free speech is a threat if he or his colleagues can't control it.

<h2>Janet Cooke Award</h2>
<P>
<H4>Newsweek, ABC Put Best Face on First Lady's White House Talks to the Dead</H4>
<P>
<H4>Poor Joan of Arc Can't Get Private Help</H4>
<P>
<DD>Reporter Bob Woodward promoted his new book The Choice with a colorful 
anecdote of Hillary Clinton, under the guidance of psychic Jean Houston, 
speaking in the White House solarium to Eleanor Roosevelt and Mahatma 
Gandhi. Woodward reported the friendship clicked when Houston said 
Hillary "was reversing thousands of years of expectation, and was there 
upfront, probably more than virtually any woman in human history -- 
apart from Joan of Arc."
<P>
<DD>Reporters at Newsweek and ABC sympathized with the First Lady in 
covering Woodward's psychic scoop. For employing a very different 
approach than their coverage of Nancy Reagan's use of an astrologer, 
Newsweek and ABC earned the Janet Cooke Award.
<P>
<DD>Newsweek Washington Bureau Chief Evan Thomas acknowledged the Nancy 
Reagan parallels of Hillary's psychic friends, but countered critics and 
comedians July 1: "A long-time searcher for spiritual meaning, Mrs. 
Clinton had conjured conversations with Eleanor Roosevelt long before 
she met Dr. Houston. Mrs Clinton is not even the first First Lady to 
dabble in psychics or mediums: the wives of Presidents Abraham Lincoln, 
Ulysses S. Grant, John Tyler, Woodrow Wilson, and Warren G. Harding all 
tried, in one way or another, to communicate beyond the grave. Unlike 
Nancy Reagan, Hillary never tried to use psychic powers to influence her 
husband."
<P>
<DD>Thomas added: "To many women, Hillary Clinton is not a cold-eyed 
conspirator, but a martyr." He quoted Mrs. Clinton's fans at a Boston 
fundraiser for the Clinton campaign saying Hillary's "being bashed by 
the press" because "a lot of people don't like a strong woman." Thomas 
concluded that to these voters, "Hillary looks just the way she does to 
her philosopher friend, Dr. Houston -- as a Joan of Arc figure, 
persecuted for her righteous crusade."
<P>
<DD>If it seems hardly noteworthy for liberal Hillary to be popular in 
Massachusetts, the June 21 Boston Herald's account of the fundraiser 
presented a less than popular figure. Reporter Joe Sciacca quoted a 
Democratic operative: "They couldn't give tickets away. A lot of people 
got [free tickets]. Even the applause lines were off. A lot of people 
are getting concerned." Thomas told MediaWatch: "Our reporter Martha 
Brant was there and saw it first-hand. They certainly were enthusiastic 
Hillary-lovers at this lunch...I don't think the point's negated if they 
had difficulty selling tickets."
<P>
<DD>This is not the spin Newsweek gave the Nancy Reagan story, revealed in 
former chief of staff Don Regan's book For the Record. In the May 16, 
1988 issue, George Hackett and Eleanor Clift did allow Mrs. Reagan's 
press secretary, Elaine Crispen, to ask: "If she could get a little 
comfort and consolation from astrology, why not?" But they also 
forwarded other spins: "Scientists showed less tolerance for the 
President's participation in what they consider medieval superstition. 
`How can you control a science budget of billions of dollars when you 
believe in nonsense of this magnitude?,' says James Kaler, professor of 
astronomy at the University of Illinois." Hackett and Clift added: 
"Criticism also rumbled from fundamentalists, who liken astrology to 
Satan worship. `This is the last straw for a lot of religious people who 
treated Reagan as their political savior,' said conservative columnist 
and former Moral Majority vice president Cal Thomas."
<P>
<DD>Newsweek failed to try these lines of attack on Mrs. Clinton's Methodist 
commitments. (It could have been done: Washington Times reporter Julia 
Duin did interview several disappointed Methodist theologians and 
evangelicals -- and some Methodist defenders -- on June 25). But that 
might have clashed with Newsweek religion reporter Kenneth Woodward's 
October 31, 1994 verdict that "Hillary Rodham Clinton is as pious as she 
is political. Methodism, for her, is not just a church but an extended 
family of faith that defines her horizons." He called the Clinton era 
. Sam Donaldson reports the White House will not take the Regan book 
lying down."
<P>
<DD>Donaldson was straightforward instead of sympathetic, airing both 
critics and supporters: "This new, unflattering portrait of the First 
Family is producing new, often humorous, unfavorable public reaction 
which political opponents are clearly savoring.... Reagan loyalists are 
incensed....Reporters like Helen Thomas are just glad to be informed." 
Donaldson ended: "Presidents and their wives look to their place in 
history and to the Reagans, Regan's book doesn't help."
Both outlets were reasonably fair (if a little jokey) with the Reagans, 
but any damaging tidbit on the Clintons, no matter how trivial, seems to 
inspire an entirely different approach: damage control. Remember when 
reporters used to provoke damage control, not practice it?

<h2>Double Standard on Rumor -- Aldrich Canceled by Networks</h2>
<P>
<DD>Under intense questioning on the June 30 This Week with David Brinkley, 
former FBI agent turned author Gary Aldrich backed down on the most 
sensational charge in his book Unlimited Access -- that Bill Clinton 
sneaks out of the White House for trysts. Reporters denounced Aldrich, 
and ABC's Nightline, Dateline NBC, and CNN's Larry King Live canceled 
interviews with him, echoing the White House line that guests meet a 
"bare threshhold of credibility." This is not a standard the networks 
have applied in the past. 
<P>
For example:
<BR>
<DD>Kitty Kelley appeared in three consecutive morning interviews on NBC's 
Today show (April 8-10, 1991) and also on CBS This Morning (April 11). 
Time and Newsweek both put her book on their covers. The New York Times 
put her unproven charges on page one, without any attempt to prove her 
allegations, including the fanciful charge that Nancy Reagan had a 
torrid affair with Frank Sinatra in the White House. Bryant Gumbel began 
NBC's three days of interviews arguing that "Best-selling author Kitty 
Kelley has proven her courage and her credibility with her 
no-holds-barred biographies."
<P>
<DD>Anita Hill drew more than 60 evening news stories in October 1991 on the 
networks before the Senate even began hearings, which featured the live 
airing of Hill's unsubstantiated allegations that Supreme Court nominee 
Clarence Thomas talked about the size of his penis and loved discussing 
films showing humans having sex with animals. On October 7, 1991, Dan 
Rather asked Hill questions like: "Why do you believe this man, Judge 
Thomas, that you have worked closely with for a long time, has not 
spoken directly to what you consider to be the substance of this 
charge?" Joseph and Susan Trento claimed, based solely on the guesswork 
of the late Ambassador Louis Fields, that George Bush had an affair with 
State Department aide Jennifer Fitzgerald. On August 11, 1992, CNN's 
Mary Tillotson was the first to ask Bush about the charge. Dateline NBC 
anchor Stone Phillips asked the President in prime time. ABC's Good 
Morning America and CBS This Morning invited the Trentos on for 
interviews.
<P>
<DD>Newt Gingrich's enemies have insisted that Gingrich showed up at the 
hospital bed of his cancer-stricken first wife Jackie with a notebook to 
discuss divorce terms. That unsubstantiated story has been told by Tom 
Brokaw on Dateline NBC, CNN's Judy Woodruff, and then-CBS star Connie 
Chung.
<P>
<DD>Gary Sick's 2,200-word April 15, 1991 New York Times op-ed jump-started 
the discredited "October Surprise" theory that held the 1980 Reagan 
campaign conspired to delay the release of the Iranian hostages. Sick 
was booked on Nightline (where Ted Koppel called him "serious, 
knowledgeable Gary Sick") and Larry King Live, and the charges drew 27 
evening news stories in 1991.

<TITLE>August 1996 Media Watch</TITLE>

<BODY bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote> 
<h2>Networks Try to Create "Houston II"</h2>
<P>
<H4>Prime-Time Coverage Finds Extremists, Asks Liberal Questions, Obsesses Over Abortion</H4>
<P>
<DD>The shadow of Houston has stubbornly remained a part of the media image 
of the Republican Party. The Texas town's 1992 convention quickly became 
a "feast of hate and fear" in the media lexicon, as the networks heaped 
70 statements or questions about the appropriateness of the alleged 
overly negative tone of the Republicans, compared to zero mentions for 
the Democrats in New York's Madison Square Garden.
<P>
<DD>The 1996 convention in San Diego offered reporters the promise of 
another Houston, a mirror image of the punitive, extremist fiasco 
reporters created out of the last convention. But the moderated tone the 
Republicans sought to project gave reporters few opportunities to create 
new controversy.
<P>
<DD>But the biased pattern of past conventions did repeat itself, if not to 
the same degree as four years ago. In short, during the San Diego 
convention: 
<UL>
<LI><a href="#labeling">(1)</a> Republican delegates, speakers, and candidates were described as conservative more than three times as often as moderate, but also as extreme more often than as moderate; 
<LI><a href="#questions">(2)</a> Reporters and anchors posed more than seven times as many questions from the liberal agenda than from a conservative agenda; and 
<LI><a href="#abortion">(3)</a> controversies, especially the intra-party tussle over abortion, of Republican exclusivity and "intolerance," far outnumbered the coverage of controversies and the exclusion of pro-life speakers at the Democrats' 1992 convention.<P>
</UL>
<DD>During the convention, a team of MediaWatch analysts in both San Diego 
and Alexandria, Virginia watched live prime time coverage offered by the 
five networks. The information appeared in a special daily Media Reality 
Check '96 newsletter. This year's study follows the methodology of 
convention studies in 1984, 1988, and 1992, and covered all ABC, CBS, 
and NBC prime time coverage, as well as the combined PBS/NBC coverage 
and CNN from 8 pm to 11pm Eastern time. In the September issue, 
MediaWatch will publish a comparison of the San Diego coverage with 
coverage of the Democrats in Chicago. 
<P>
<a name="labeling">
<B>Labeling</B>
<P>
<DD>Network reporters followed the usual pattern of convention labeling, 
with 46 conservative (with 16 references to extreme conservatism) to 13 
moderate labels. NBC had only two conservative labels and four moderate 
tags. CBS, with nine references to conservatives and five labels for 
moderates, also came close to balancing the labels. ABC(10-0), CNN 
(16-2), and PBS (9-2) underlined the conservative nature of the party. 
PBS led in the use of extreme labels with six, followed by CNN (4), CBS 
(3), ABC (2) and NBC (1).
<P>
<DD>The amount of labeling declined every night: from 29 on Monday to 14 on 
Tuesday, 11 on Wednesday, and five on Thursday. The label count did not 
include mentions of the party's attempts to woo "moderate voters," and 
also excluded historical references (for example, a reference to a "more 
moderate" Richard Nixon in the 1950s). Some examples of references to 
extremism:
<P>
<DD>Margaret Warner asked Newt Gingrich on PBS Monday night: "The Dole 
campaign officials do say that partly this convention is designed to 
undo the damage done to the Republican image by you and the Republican 
Congress, which fairly or unfairly, the voters seem to see as extreme. 
You've heard all the words. Do you think that's true and does it make 
you feel repudiated at all?"
<P>
<DD>On Tuesday night, CBS reporter Lesley Stahl explained the night about to 
unfold: "The whole purpose of tonight's convention, the whole program is 
to diminish the images of this party as extreme because that's what's 
turning the women off. Four years ago, the main speaker at the 
convention, the Republican convention, was Pat Buchanan. He was yelling, 
his pitchforks were raised. Tonight it will be Colin Powell, he will 
appeal to civility. On the platform, women find that extreme. It's 
turning them off." (The study did not incorporate evening news 
statements, like this one from Dan Rather to Jack Kemp on Monday's CBS 
Evening News: "Even some Republicans describe the current platform as 
quote, `harsh, extreme,' even `radical.' Do you see it that way?")
<P>
<DD>NBC's Tim Russert echoed Stahl the same night: "Key words: mean-spirited 
and extremist. They want to avoid those labels. They have thus far after 
two days and that's why you're not going to see Newt Gingrich in prime 
time tonight...I think the speech by Senator Hutchison of Texas is 
dangerous, Tom, because she uses words that could be interpreted by some 
people as mean."
<P>
<DD>Also on Tuesday came this explanation from CBS veteran Bob Schieffer: 
"The Dole campaign had a very delicate assignment as they see it. They 
want to get the word out to mainstream America that Senator Dole's 
thinking is more in line with that thinking, than perhaps even some of 
these very conservative delegates in this hall."
<P>
<DD>References to Republican moderates often came with a skeptical tone. On 
Tuesday night, CBS reporter Ed Bradley asked a Buchanan delegate: 
"There's been an effort to paint a moderate face to this convention. How 
does this sit with you?"
<P>
<a name="questions">
<B>Agenda Questions</B>
<P>
<DD>When network reporters and analysts weren't dwelling on media images or 
tactical gambits, their questions on the issues came more than seven 
times as often from the liberal agenda as they did from the conservative 
agenda: 51 questions were asked from the left, to just six from the 
right. ABC asked only three liberal agenda questions and no conservative 
ones in four nights. CBS came closest to balancing agenda questions 
(8-3), while NBC (10-1), CNN (10-1), and PBS (20-1) stuck almost 
completely to agenda questions from the left:
<P>
<DD>A number of the questions from the left poured skepticism on the Dole 
tax cut plan. NBC's Maria Shriver asked New Jersey Gov. Christie Todd 
Whitman on Tuesday: "Bill Clinton has said that Bob Dole's proposal for 
the economy would end up crippling the economy, balloon the deficit. Why 
is he wrong?" She added: "Governor, are you not all concerned about what 
happens to the federal deficit, which is a major, major concern for most 
of the delegates at this convention, based on the polling that we've 
done, if Bob Dole is able to put into effect his 15 percent tax cut?"
<P>
<DD>On Monday night, Tom Brokaw asked Gov. Pete Wilson: "But why should the 
children of illegal immigrants be penalized, as the language in the 
platform indicates they will be, especially those who become citizens if 
they're born here, even if they're born to illegal immigrants?"
<P>
<DD>On CNN, Bob Franken asked conservative evangelist Jerry Falwell Monday 
night about HIV-positive Republican activist Mary Fisher's speech: "Many 
of the AIDS activists would claim that part of the problem they have is 
the attitude toward AIDS victims among fundamentalists, among 
conservatives like yourself. How do you respond to that?" He added: "But 
you are aware that many in the gay community feel that it is hostility 
from people like your followers that contributes to the problems they 
have."
<P>
<DD>On Wednesday night, after paralyzed former police officer Steve McDonald 
addressed the delegates, Franken pointedly interviewed National Rifle 
Association chief Wayne LaPierre: "I'm going to ask you is here you have 
a policeman who was shot in the line of duty with weapons and...the 
criticism of your organization is that it's because of you those weapons 
are so readily available....Here we have a policeman who was shot by 
weapons that might not have been out there, the critics say, were it not 
for the NRA."
<P>
<DD>There were a few examples of conservative agenda questions, like Bob 
Schieffer's Tuesday question to Texas Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison: "You 
talked a lot about Bill Clinton's broken promises. What promise do you 
think -- I know Republicans are trying to bring women into the big tent 
-- what promise has he made or broken, in your view, that has hurt women 
the most?"
<P>
<DD>That night, Dan Rather asked Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson: 
"Now the main speaker tonight, as was the case for the main speaker last 
night, is pro-choice. How mad does that make you?"
<P>
<a name="abortion">
<B>Controversy:  Abortion</B>
<P>
<DD>Peter Jennings suggested in the August 12 San Diego Union-Tribune: 
"Whenever a political party goes out of its way to restrain, isolate, or 
box in other voices -- and both parties do it -- then you almost 
invariably attract the attention of journalists." But Jennings and the 
rest of ABC, as well as CBS, in 1992 ignored the Democrats' decision to 
refuse Pennsylvania Gov. Bob Casey an opportunity to state his pro-life 
views from the Madison Square Garden convention podium. NBC interviewed 
Casey once. CNN also interviewed him once, and mentioned the controversy 
on four other occasions.
<P>
<DD>In San Diego, the networks drove home the controversy within the 
Republican Party over abortion: reporters, anchors, and analysts 
referred to the party's split over the issue -- including platform 
disagreements and Gov. Pete Wilson's "disinvitation" to speak -- on 55 
occasions. The emphasis on the abortion controversy was mostly contained 
to the first two nights -- 21 mentions on Monday night, 25 on Tuesday, 
and then only eight on Wednesday night and one on Thursday. CNN (with 18 
mentions) dwelled on the controversy the most, followed by PBS (13), CBS 
(12), ABC (8), and NBC (4).
<P>
<DD>On Monday night, NBC's Tom Brokaw stressed: "But so far the indication 
is that these people, who want to encourage a more tolerant, moderate 
attitude toward abortion have been denied the right to speak. Their 
Republican credentials are impeccable, and they're going everywhere and 
complaining that they're not going to be allowed in this hall." Minutes 
later, he added: "What you will not see at this podium -- the Governor 
of the host state, Pete Wilson. He's not going to be allowed to speak 
because he has some views on abortion that the Dole campaign would not 
rather have expressed here, and also William Weld, the Governor of 
Massachusetts."
<P>
<DD>On Tuesday, CNN's Bernard Shaw suggested: "Bob Dole did not get the 
tolerance lanugage he wanted in the abortion plank which came out of 
this platform committee earlier in the week. He didn't get a few other 
things. The conservatives have ironclad control over this convention, 
but he did get the opportunity to have some people who are pro-choice 
speak before this convention tonight, one of them Susan Molinari."
<P>
<DD>CBS reporter Lesley Stahl took on the controversy from the pro-life side 
of the fence on Wednesday before labeling it extreme: "We're hearing a 
lot of grousing about the repackaging of the party...In gagging 
opponents of abortion, affirmative action, those kinds of issues, Bob 
Dole may be turning off the very people he needs to leave the convention 
gung-ho. They say putting three pro-choice women on last night was too 
much. But Bob Dole has a dilemma: In order to win, he does have to 
change the perception of this party as too extreme."
<P>
<DD>(The study did not include evening news statements, like Peter Jennings' 
oration on the Tuesday World News Tonight: "The right to abortion has 
never been an overwhelming issue for women at election time. But this 
fight within the Republican Party has many Republican women questioning 
how far this party is willing to go to limit their rights.")
<P>
<DD>The convention week focus on abortion was only a small part of the 
network attention this year to the GOP abortion plank. Just during the 
Sunday morning interview shows on August 11, the networks asked 27 
questions about exclusion of pro-abortion Republicans. Eleven questions 
were posed on CNN's Late Edition, compared to nine on NBC's Meet the 
Press, four on ABC's This Week with David Brinkley, and three on CBS's 
Face the Nation.
<P>
<DD>From April 30, when four "moderate" governors declared they would 
challenge the party's pro-life plank, to August 9, ABC, CBS, and NBC 
preferred beating on the Republican side of the story by 60 to 1. The 
networks aired 30 full stories on the evening newscasts, compared to 
only one ABC story on the Democrats. The morning shows aired 30 full 
stories or interview segments on the GOP debate, to nothing about the 
Democrats. (That doesn't include five anchor briefs on the evening shows 
and 34 on the morning shows).
<P>
<DD>CNN's evening newscast The World Today aired seven full stories and ten 
anchor briefs on the GOP pro-life plank, to only one anchor brief on the 
Democrats. CNN's Inside Politics, a show favored by political junkies, 
aired 38 full stories or interview segments on the GOP to two segments 
on the Democrats. The Democrats held platform hearings on July 10 and 
11, and finished on August 5 -- with almost no media attention.

<H2>Ross Takes on the Boss </H2> 
ABC's Brian Ross filed stories during the GOP conclave on corporate  
money lavished on the GOP, but his August 15 World News Tonight report  
looked at a surpising target:

<blockquote>"Very much in the middle of the mix are the giant media corporations,  
like CNN, whose multi-million-dollar merger has yet to be formally  
approved by federal regulators. Time Warner gave more than $100,000 to  
be an official sponsor of the convention." Former Los Angeles Times  
reporter Dwight Morris told Ross media companies shouldn't use the  
conventions to lobby, and Ross noted: "But that didn't stop CBS lobby  
ists from giving the Republicans thousands of dollars to help pay for  
the cost of food and liquor in the skybox belonging to Republican Party  
Chairman Haley Barbour."</blockquote>

<DD>Ross even reported on his own bosses: "Last night, the ABC hospitality  
suite was a lobbyist's dream. With visits from Congressman Tom Bliley,  
the chairman of the House Commerce Committee, which handles  
telecommunications issues. And then from the number two man in the  
House, Majority Leader Dick Armey, who could be seen with top ABC  
executives, including the ABC lobbyist, who insisted he wasn't  
lobbying."

<DD>The Friday before the Democrats convened Ross reported "a labor union  
under federal investigation for its ties to the mafia"  contributed at  
least $250,000 to the party.

<H2>News Bites from Media Watch</H2>
<P>
<BR>
<H4>Unconcerned About Rape.</H4>
<P>
<DD> Just after rape victim Jan Licence addressed the Republican convention  
on victims' rights on August 13, NBC's Maria Shriver seemed baffled.  
During combined PBS/NBC coverage Shriver posed to her this question:  
"But why [speak out] at a Republican convention? So many people have  
said that they don't think this ticket, or perhaps this party, is  
supportive of women's issues. Why make this stand here?"
<DD>Later, during NBC's prime time broadcast, Tom Brokaw interviewed Licence  
and asked: "Do you think -- this is a party that is dominated by men and  
this convention is dominated by men as well...Do you think before  
tonight they thought very much about what happens in America with rape?"
<P>
<H4>Gumbel Scoldings.</H4>
<P>
<DD>To keep "out what officials call the biased liberal media," the RNC  
launched GOP-TV to provide complete convention coverage, NBC's Bob Faw  
reported on the August 13 Today. Faw asserted: "What GOP-TV calls  
unfiltered, doesn't even begin to pay lip service to balance or  
fairness." NBC should know. 
<DD>Here's how Bryant Gumbel opened that morning's Today: "Good morning.  
Retired General Colin Powell, a new recruit to the GOP cause, addressed  
the delegates in San Diego last night, drawing cheers with accounts of  
why he became a Republican and why he'll vote for Bob Dole. But although  
his speech was generally well-received, the reception was restrained,  
and there were boos whenever Powell steered away from the right. Though  
they booed and also heckled dissent, Republicans claimed the mantle of  
inclusion throughout the first night of their convention. We can expect  
more of the same today, Tuesday, August 13, 1996." 
<DD>Guess which network scares journalists? Faw reported that "Jonathan  
Alter of Newsweek thinks GOP-TV has started something deceptive and  
unwholesome." Alter explained: "It is political propaganda, masquerading  
as news, and that's a problem." Political propaganda masquerading as  
news? Sounds like Bryant Gumbel.
<P>
<H4>It's the Republican's Fault.</H4>
<P>
<DD>Calling conservatives "extremists" and lying about budget "cuts" have  
been Democratic mantra, but two networks blamed the GOP for getting  
nasty. NBC's Maria Shriver asked Dole California campaign chairman Ken  
Khachigian on August 14: "You said coming out of this campaign, Clinton  
is going to have 80 days of hell, that we are going to take Clinton down  
in California, that we are going to take him down hard. How ugly is this  
going to get?"
<DD>About 20 minutes after Bob Dole completed his acceptance speech, CNN  
anchor Bernard Shaw discovered the beginning of a nasty campaign: "I've  
maintained that this campaign is going to be one of the nastiest,  
bare-knuckled, direct-to-the-gut campaigns in America's political  
history. Listen to this one sentence, quote `It is demeaning to the  
nation that within the Clinton administration a core of the elite never  
grew up, never did anything real, never sacrificed, never suffered and  
never learned, should have the power to fund with your earnings their  
dubious and self-serving schemes.'" 
<P>
<H4>Decrying Clinton Criticism.</H4>
<P>
<DD>Journalistic sensitivity to any attacks on Bill Clinton quickly came  
through loud and clear the morning after U.S. Rep. Susan Molinari and  
Senator Kay Bailey Hutchision spoke. "GOP Unleashes An Attack On Clinton  
Over Character and His Economic Policies," charged a New York Times  
headline. "Congresswoman Susan Molinari took on the role of attack dog  
last night, using her keynote address to attack the President," Bryant  
Gumbel began the August 14 Today.
<DD>NBC's morning crew stuck to the Democratic line in their questions.  
Gumbel asked Tim Russert: "There's an old adage that says what you do  
speaks so loudly I can't hear what you say. Republicans are speaking  
tolerance and diversity. Are you seeing any evidence of it or quite the  
contrary?" Katie Couric inquired of Republican strategist Charles Black:  
"Chris Dodd of the DNC says this is a huge con game. That the way you're  
portraying the party as this moderate inclusive party just doesn't gibe  
with say, the platform, and some of the attitudes of members of the GOP.  
How do you address that?" 
<DD>Over on Good Morning America, news anchor Elizabeth Vargas asserted:  
"Some of the harshest words were from Texas Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison,  
who tried to paint the President as a tax and spend liberal." Co-host  
Charles Gibson added: "Polls will tell you these days that people do not  
want much partisanship in their politics, but they got it at the  
Republican convention last night. There were attacks on President  
Clinton's credibility, integrity, even his eating habits." ABC's Vargas  
didn't shy away from stereotyping: "But in addition to a gender gap,  
Republicans have had problems attracting minorities, a party that has  
traditionally been home to the angry white man."
<P>
<H4>Gutless Moderates? </H4>
<P>
<DD>If only the moderates were more aggressive then conservatives could be  
defeated, Newsweek Senior Editor Jonathan Alter wished in the August 19  
issue. He gave pro-abortion Republicans his recipe for political  
success. In a piece titled "The Passion Gap," he wrote: "Pro-choice  
Republicans insist it's their party, too. But the high-minded moderates  
are too polite to take on the hard-charging right. Until they do, the  
GOP may never truly win over the country."
<DD>The crux of his wisdom? Attack your loyal supporters:  
"This is now the fifth nominating convention in which the GOP has  
applied an anti-abortion litmus test. Ronald Reagan signed an  
abortion-rights law as Governor of California, then changed his position  
in time for his presidential campaigns. George Bush was such a supporter  
of family planning as a congressman that he was called `Rubbers,' but by  
the 1980s had flip-flopped. Bob Dole is pro-life but has gone back and  
forth so many times on platform language and planks that he has raised  
basic questions about his leadership. If he can't stand up to a Phyllis  
Schlafly, how would he handle a Saddam Hussein?"
<DD>Alter closed by holding up the Democratic Party, the same party that  
shut Governor Bob Casey out of its 1992 convention for his pro-life  
views, as an example of the big-tent the GOP should emulate: "The only  
real way to change the Republican Party is for...a pro-choice candidate  
to run for President in 2000....Sometime soon a compelling moderate  
Republican will take a leaf from the successes of centrist Democrats and  
enter a few primaries. Then we'll find out if the Republicans can  
finally pitch that big tent they like to talk about."
<P>
<H4>Republicans Scare Women.</H4>
<P>
 <DD>Supposed GOP intolerance and how Republican policies scare women  
dominated morning show interviews during the Republican gathering in San  
Diego. Talking to Susan Molinari, Christine Todd Whitman, and Kay Bailey  
Hutchison on August 13, Good Morning America's Charlie Gibson laid out  
why women are turned off by Republicans: "It was the Republican Party  
that did take the lead on ending federal welfare payments as they have  
been traditionally paid over the last 50 to 60 years and the prime  
beneficiaries of that are women. It is the Republican Party that took  
the lead on reducing the rate of growth in Medicare and Medicaid. It is  
the Republican Party now that is trying to make an issue of denying  
education and benefits to the children of illegal immigrants. It is the  
Republican Party that has rejected in the last week or so, tolerance  
language on abortion in the platform."
<DD>He also asked: "There was an attempt by some in the platform hearings to  
get language included in the platform that simply asked for toleration  
of dissenting views particularly on abortion. It was language that Bob  
Dole wanted in the platform. The party rejected him, it rejected your  
views, all three of you in this, is this a tolerant party, do you feel  
comfortable in it with its position on tolerance?"
<DD>Quizzing Colin Powell on Today, Katie Couric queried: "Does the party  
platform trouble you? Does the fact that some of these governors opted  
not to speak because they were told they could not discuss their views  
on abortion, do all those things make you basically doubt that this is a  
big tent here?"
<P>
<H4>Buchanan "Destroyed" Bush.</H4>
<P>
<DD>Four years later the media still promote the idea that Pat Buchanan's  
1992 speech, not reneging on his "no new taxes" pledge, led to George  
Bush's defeat. Andrea Mitchell stated on MSNBC August 12 after Colin  
Powell spoke: "There's a real interesting contrast here because Pat  
Buchanan set the tone for the Houston convention four years ago with the  
same prime time starring role on the first night of the convention and  
that of course was the speech that many people feel destroyed George  
Bush's chance of winning re-election because it set a very narrow,  
exclusive and mean-spirited tone and tonight we had the contrast of  
Colin Powell." 
<DD>Earlier in the day on ABC's Good Morning America, co-host Charles Gibson  
couldn't let the issue die: "It is this convention that is going to be  
harmonious. The Republicans are determined that there will be no repeat  
of Houston 1992, which many saw as a harsh and divisive convention."  
While never mentioning that raising taxes could have cost Bush the  
election, ABC's John Cochran opined on World News Tonight: "The one  
thing that Bush did not have to tell Dole is that at all cost Dole  
should try to prevent a re-run of that bitter divisive convention four  
years ago in Houston, that so badly damaged Bush's chances for  
re-election. Dole knows that only too well."
<P>
<H4>Delegates Out of Touch.</H4>
<P>
<DD>Early in the first day of PBS/NBC coverage, millionaire Tom Brokaw  
asked: "The big question, of course, what is the Republican Party these  
days?...Well on the floor of this convention hall, they are  
overwhelmingly white and male, male by a factor of about two to  
one...The largest single income group, more than 38 percent of the  
people here earn more than $100,000 a year." On the CBS Evening News  
that night Ed Bradley asserted: "For the most part they are white, male,  
and they are older than the average American. They are also more  
conservative than the average American. They are also wealthier - about  
a third of the delegates earn more than $100,000 a year." 
<DD>Millionaire anchor Dan Rather announced in prime time: "Delegates in  
this convention have been selected, inspected, detected, categorized by  
the press, the pols, the pros, and the pollsters. We know they're mostly  
male, overwhelmingly white, mostly well to the right politically, and  
almost one in five of these delegates is a millionaire."
<DD>CNN's Judy Woodruff raised the media-created issue with keynote speaker  
Susan Molinari: "We look at the statistics of how many women delegates.  
What? 43 percent in 1992. Only 36 percent of the delegates are women  
this year. What sort of signal does that send to the country, you  
think?"
<DD>Woodruff also complained: "We talked to Jack Kemp a little while ago and  
asked him about, among other things, the fact that not only not just the  
language in the platform - only three percent of these delegates are  
African American. Only 36 percent of these delegates are women. This is  
not a convention that is necessarily representative even of the broader  
Republican Party, the people who vote Republican, much less the  
electorate overall."
<DD>A Washington Post survey of delegates determined that while 56 percent  
of Republicans reported an income of over $75,000, so did 46 percent of  
Democrats.

<h2>Reaganomics, the Scary Sequel?</h2>
<P>
<H4>Skepticism Showered on Dole Tax Cut Absent for Clinton's 1993 Proposals</H4>
<P>
<DD>Bob Dole's surprising advocacy of an across-the-board tax cut drew quick 
criticism from reporters as the unwelcome return of deficit-ballooning 
Reaganomics.
<P>
<DD>Hours after Dole's tax cut announcement on August 5, NBC Nightly News 
reporter David Bloom declared: "Most economists say the  Reagan tax cuts 
did worsen the budget deficit and many are skeptical of Dole's plan." 
NBC's Mike Jensen agreed about "most economists" minutes later: "They 
say these tax cuts could cause huge budget deficits as they did during 
the Reagan years."
<P>
<DD>CBS Evening News reporter Linda Douglass warned  Dole weeks before on 
July 23: "Each of the proposals he's considering would cost hundreds of 
billions of dollars. Dole will have to convince voters that won't drive 
up the deficit."
<P>
<DD>Newsweek's Joe Klein pronounced: "The Dole tax cut stands, to all but 
hard-core taxophobes, as a transparent and rather pathetic bit of 
politics. He wants to cut $548 billion over six years? And balance the 
budget? Does anyone actually believe this?"
<P>
<DD>The August 12 Investor's Business Daily noted the real Reagan record: 
that Clinton's own Economic Report of the President showed "receipts 
from individual income taxes rose to $446 billion in fiscal `89, 
Reagan's last budget, from $286 billion in fiscal `81, the year Reagan 
began to slash personal rates. That's a 56 percent gain...Spending rose 
to $1.143 trillion in `89 from $678 billion in `81. That's a 69 percent 
gain."
<P>
<DD>Skepticism of Reaganomics stood in stark contrast to the media's 
salesmanlike reaction to Clinton economic proposals in 1992 and 1993. On 
the September 15, 1993 Sunday Morning, CBS's Douglass simply passed on 
the notion that Clinton could insure 37 million uninsured Americans with 
a cigarette tax: "They have a very elaborate plan to pay for this 
revolution in health care. It doesn't provide much in the way of taxes, 
just a sin tax, cigarette tax. They claim the money's going to come from 
savings in spending."
<P>
<DD>After years of stopping deficit-busting stimulus packages and 
nationalized health plans, Newsweek's Howard Fineman awarded the credit 
for the deficit not to Dole, but to his rival: "Clinton, meanwhile, can 
brag that the annual deficit has been cut in half on his watch -- and 
that he's a champion of fiscal responsibility. In other words, he can be 
Bob Dole."
<P>
<DD>The next week, Time contributor George J. Church echoed Fineman: "A case 
could be made that the candidate who best represents the fiscally 
conservative, moderate Republican tradition is, believe it or not, Bill 
Clinton."

<h2>Network "Fear" and "Anxiety"</h2>
<P>
<H4>Don't Touch Welfare!</H4>
<P>
<DD>Conservatives view welfare reform as a victory -- both for those trapped 
in the system and for taxpayers tired of paying for lifetime recipients. 
But after President Clinton agreed to sign the bill, the networks came 
at it from the left, focusing on those who supposedly would be hurt, 
thus helping Clinton put himself in the middle of the political 
spectrum.
<P>
<DD>NBC's Lisa Myers began a July 31 Nightly News segment: "For six years 
now Cindy McDonald and her three children have struggled to make their 
$400 welfare check and $300 in food stamps last until the end of the 
month. She says she can never treat her kids to candy or soda, they're 
expensive luxuries and has no car to take them anywhere. The phrase 
`welfare reform' infuriates her." She whined: "If they strip me from 
what little I have right now, then I don't know how my kids are going to 
eat." Myers did point out that McDonald actually has two years to find a 
job, but concluded: "Exactly how McDonald and others will cope with the 
change is uncertain. Even supporters of the bill privately admit that 
this is a gamble, that some will lose.''
<P>
<DD>On the CBS Evening News, substitute anchor Paula Zahn announced: "Once 
the welfare bill becomes law, millions of Americans will find their 
lives starting to change in startling and unwelcome ways." Reporter  
John Blackstone looked at three recipients. First up, a woman who just 
had a baby: "[Martina] Gillis, a single mother of two, has been on 
welfare for three years. The new welfare reforms would force her to get 
a job, any job, but that would mean giving up, or at least postponing 
her dream, of graduating from college." Blackstone did ask her if it's 
the taxpayers' responsibility to pay for her mistake and then moved to a 
Mexican immigrant who cried about being cut off.
<P>
<DD>Third, leading into his conclusion, he put on a woman who "says she 
applied for welfare today so she can take care of her two daughters. 
Welfare reform may be aimed at the mothers. But the effects of this 
experiment, good or bad, will be felt equally by the children."
<P>
<DD>On the next day's CBS Evening News, Zahn warned: "The new, landmark 
welfare overhaul President Clinton promised to sign won't be law for a 
while yet, but there is already is a great deal of fear and anxiety all 
over the country over the impact it will have."

<H2>Backhanded Bias</H2>
<H3>Kemp Choice Spurs Talk of "Haters"  </H3>

<DD>Bob Dole's choice of Jack Kemp as a running mate drew praise from a  
number of reporters and analysts, but sometimes that praise accompanied  
backhanded insults about the "haters" that comprise the rest of the  
Republican Party.

<DD>CNN polling analyst Bill Schneider touted the choice on the August 9  
Inside Politics, praising Kemp as he impugned other conservatives: "He  
is a rare combination -- a nice conservative. These days conservatives  
are supposed to be mean. They're supposed to be haters. Bob Novak talked  
a minute ago about the frowning face of the Republican Party. Jack Kemp  
is buoyant, he's effusive, he's inclusive of everybody in the country,  
not just in the Republican Party. He puts a different face on that  
ticket."

<DD>On the August 9 World News Tonight, ABC's Cokie Roberts also played  
backhand with Kemp: "He's very optimistic, but he's also very inclusive,  
reaching out to minorities, to women, being for immigration, for  
affirmative action. And I think that's very important for this  
particular convention, Peter, and this party, which is seen somewhat  
dour, and somewhat mean in its ways to have someone with a big smile on  
his face saying `you all come,' and `I'm going to cut your taxes' while  
you're at it, is not a bad thing for the Republicans."

<DD>During live coverage August 10 of Kemp's vice presidential announcement  
in Russell, Kansas, CNN anchor A0Judy Woodruff declared: "On welfare, up  
through the last few years, he's advocated more moderate policies than  
those that were passed this month by the Republican-controlled Congress.  
Jack Kemp does not like the idea of taking money -- yanking money away  
from welfare mothers with small children."

<DD>Hours later on CNN's Capital Gang, Woodruff's husband, Al Hunt,  
Executive Washington Editor of The Wall Street Journal, disparaged the  
platform while praising the Kemp pick: "Jack Kemp is gonna not only  
excite this convention, but he cuts across regional, racial and  
generational lines, across all of America, and I think that he and his  
incredibly attractive family are going to add lustre and intellectual  
firepower. Now there are some risks. He has a few flaky views, the gold  
standard for one, and more important, Jack Kemp is a can-do optimist who  
cares about all people and that s going to put him at odds with a  
platform that is protectionist, mean-spirited, anti-immigration,  
insensitive to racial minorities."   

<DD>On that day's Inside Politics, Bill Schneider proceeded to repeat the  
previous day's slur: "Kemp also has a rare combination of qualities. He  
s a nice conservative. There haven't been too many of those since Ronald  
Reagan. Most conservatives these days come across as mean [video of Newt  
Gingrich] or intolerant [video of Pat Buchanan] or grouchy [video of Bob  
Dole]. Kemp is tolerant and inclusive. He has an excellent relationship  
with minorities. He showed real courage two years ago when he came out  
against Proposition 187, the punitive anti-illegal immigration measure  
in California. Kemp is not a hater."

<h2>News Bites</h2>
<CENTER><h3>From the September 1996 Media Watch</h3></CENTER>
<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<H4>Poll: Most Say Media Favor Clinton.  </H4>
A September survey for the Pew Research Center for the People and the  
Press found that while most of the public thinks coverage of Clinton and  
Dole has been fair, when asked "Who do you think most newspaper  
reporters and TV journalists want to see win the presidential election,"  
59 percent said Clinton, 17 percent Dole and just one percent Perot.
<p>
As to how much influence news organizations have on which candidate  
becomes President, 64 percent thought "too much," 30 percent said "about  
right" and a mere four percent believed "too little."
<p>
<H4>
Nasty Bob, Pure Bill </H4>  

On September 12, Bob Dole demanded that Bill Clinton release his medical  
records and complained that Clinton's ads were overwhelmingly negative.  
Instead of examining the tone of Clinton ads, ABC and CBS portrayed Dole  
as the villain.  
<p>
On ABC's World News Tonight, Peter Jennings said: "The campaign for  
President took a nasty turn today. First, Bob Dole departed from his  
standard stump speech in Kentucky, lashing out at the Democrats for what  
he says they are saying about him, and negative advertising was the  
kindest thing Mr. Dole had to say." After a piece on Dole, Jennings  
introduced the next story: "The President is going to come under further  
Republican attack with the release next week of the House Committee on  
Government Operations and Oversight's report on the firings at the White  
House travel office."
<p>
On the CBS Evening News Dan Rather followed the same Clinton-as-victim  
theme: "Now for his part, Bob Dole reopened one of his favorite lines of  
attack today about President Clinton's health records." Reporter Phil  
Jones provided a very short piece just on the medical records,  
concluding: "Dan, this campaign is headed exactly where everybody  
expected it to go: personal."
<p>

<H4>Bloom and Doom  </H4>

Only NBC Nightly News bothered to show viewers that night what upset  
Dole. Tom Brokaw declared: "Bob Dole on the ropes and looking for a way  
to boost his sagging campaign made it clear today he is taking off the  
gloves in the war of the political airwaves."
<p>
Reporter David Bloom began: "Stung by a barrage of negative television  
advertising, Bob Dole today accused Bill Clinton of running a campaign  
of fear, of engaging in character assassination." Bloom aired Clinton  
declaring "This must be a campaign of ideas, not a campaign of insults,"  
and then added: "But since then, the Dole camp claims the Democrats have  
run only 42 positive ads with 4, 0 negative ads running across the  
country."  
<p>
Bloom explained: "Dole aides say the campaign will double its ad budget  
next week, unveiling new attack ads blaming Clinton for rising teen drug  
use, ads even tougher than this one." After an ad clip, Bloom ended: "At  
a Dole rally today the music blared `get ready.' Get ready, that is, for  
a very nasty campaign."    
<p>

<H4>What "Moderate" Democrats?</H4>

 "Return to Chicago: This Time, the Democrats Embrace Moderation,"  
declared the headline on the front of the Washington Post's August 25  
convention section. Four pages later, the Post headline over a story on  
a survey of delegates read: "Delegates Leaning More Liberal Than Their  
Leader or the Rank and File." Indeed, 82 percent favored affirmative  
action, 65 percent were against a balanced budget amendment, 72 percent  
opposed "reducing spending on social programs," but 65 percent wanted  
less defense spending.
<P>
Three days later, New York Times reporter David Rosebaum insisted the  
Democratic platform "takes a middle ground between the unfettered  
capitalism and government-enforced morality espoused by Republicans and  
the welfare-state economics and Aquarian values that once formed  
Democrats' image." Four paragraphs later, Rosenbaum summarized the  
"middle ground" policies: "The Democrats call for government-paid  
abortions for poor women, full civil rights for homosexuals, a strong  
commitment to public schools, gun control, tobacco regulations, a  
continuation of affirmative action programs and a greater emphasis on  
environmental protection than on the development of resources."
<P>

<H4>"Most Economists" Split.</H4>

An August survey of 700 economists found that "52 percent blame the  
growth of the federal deficit in the 1980s on increased government  
spending more than on the Reagan tax cut," which was blamed by 48  
percent. The fact that economists are about evenly split contradicts  
many recent media reports.
<p>
"Most economists say the Reagan tax cuts did worsen the budget deficit  
and many are skeptical of Dole's plan," announced reporter David Bloom  
on the August 5 NBC Nightly News. Colleague Mike Jensen insisted a few  
minutes later that "most analysts say it's not good economics." The next  
morning a headline over a Washington Post news story declared:  
"Economists Question Dole's Plan." The headline over a Boston Globe news  
story asserted: "Economists Cool to Dole's Tax-Cut Plan: Candidate  
Speaks of Growth, but Analysts See No Big Payoff."   
<p>
The poll of 700 members of the American Economics Association discovered  
that 81 percent agreed that the Reagan tax cuts increased economic  
growth. A plurality of 42 percent "want to see the next Congress put a  
high priority on both restraining government spending and cutting  
taxes," matching the Dole-Kemp promise. William Adams, a professor at  
George Washington University, directed the poll conducted August 19-21.  
<p>
Though reported in The Weekly Standard and The Washington Times, none of  
the previously noted outlets revised their claims. In fact, in the  
September 9 Post, reporter Clay Chandler focused only on the answer  
which put Dole in the minority: "A majority expressed doubt about the  
notion that 30 percent of the revenue lost from a 15 percent cut in  
marginal income tax rates would" be recaptured.
<p>

<H4>Another Gore Gaffe That Wasn't.</H4>

After Al Gore's emotional August 28 speech recalled the 1984 death of  
his sister Nancy and how it motivated him to fight the tobacco industry,  
ABC, NBC, and CNN did suggest hypocrisy. Jennings noted that "tobacco  
companies are here in Chicago wining and dining the hierarchy of the  
Democratic Party." NBC's Tom Brokaw recalled that "the Gore family were  
tobacco farmers." On CNN, Judy Woodruff suggested that Gore "was  
responding to what was said in San Diego," where his tobacco roots were  
highlighted.
<p>
But all the networks ignored the July 3 New York Times report that in  
1988, Al Gore told an audience of tobacco farmers during his  
presidential campaign: "Throughout most of my life, I raised tobacco. I  
want you to know that with my own hands, all of my life, I put it in the  
plant beds and transferred it. I've hoed it. I've dug in it. I've  
sprayed it, I've chopped it, I've shredded it, spiked it, put it in the  
barn and stripped it and A0sold it." Dan Quayle can only dream of  
getting away with something like that. 
<P>

<H4>Base Bias.</H4>

CBS Evening News took two different approaches to the passionate poles  
that create each party's base. The day before the Republican convention,  
CBS reporter John Roberts suggested "hard-line anti-abortionists"  
controlled the Republican Party: "Delegates are pursuing their own  
agendas and forcing party leaders, including Dole, to fall into line  
behind them...so far the rogue elephants seem to be calling the shots."  
<p>
But on August 28, reporter Harry Smith's piece on unions didn't talk  
about ideologically extreme unions pushing around the party, but how  
Bill Clinton failed to be liberal enough for them: "It still takes steel  
to make America's cars. It still takes labor to get a Democrat elected  
President. But talk to the union rank and file, and you'll find that  
their enthusiasm is less than red hot.... We talked with United Auto  
Workers in Dearborn, Michigan this week. Their biggest gripe: Bill  
Clinton's support of the North American Free Trade Agreement...Organized  
labor will invest millions of dollars to get Bill Clinton elected this  
fall. These dues-paying members wonder if they are still getting their  
money's worth."  
<P>

<H4>Sunday Lefties.  </H4>

The networks came at Republicans from the left on abortion in San Diego,  
and on the Sunday before the Democrats convened, they also came at  
Democrats from the left. By concentrating on liberal complaints about  
welfare reform, reporters helped Bill Clinton's effort to portray  
himself as a centrist. On the August  
<P>
CBS Evening News, Dan Rather demanded of DNC General Chairman Chris  
Dodd: "You said this morning that the party's message will focus on the  
needs and cares of the people. Now, how do you reconcile that with a  
President who has just signed a quote `welfare reform bill' which by  
general agreement is going to put a lot of poor children on the street?"  
Earlier, on Face the Nation, CBS reporter Rita Braver asked Chicago  
Mayor Richard Daley: "Aren't you scared about what is going to happen?  
Aren't you afraid you are going to have a lot of hungry children?"  
<P>
That same day NBC Meet the Press moderator Tim Russert demanded of Dodd:  
"It's an issue of morality to many people, and how can you defend a  
President who basically said to the congressional Democrats: Listen,  
that's your view, but I'm doing this, because -- was it politically  
expedient?" Russert tried the same line with strategist James Carville:  
"But the Democratic Party for sixty years, James Carville, fought for a  
minimum guarantee payment to poor children and Bill Clinton undid that.  
Don't you have to draw the line someplace and say `I'm a Democrat and  
this is what I stand for'?"

<P>
<H4>Welfare-State Television</H4>

All three networks featured stories August 27 critical of the new  
welfare reform law. On NBC Nightly News, Tom Brokaw presented his view:  
"There are serious questions about what happens to these people after  
they're taken off the welfare rolls. Andrea Mitchell went to Indiana to  
look at the conflict between fixing the system and doing the right thing  
by people." Mitchell featured no welfare reform proponents, just social  
workers, Jesse Jackson, and impending victims: "Kimberly Gilbert will  
get benefits for two years. After that, she's cut off, whether or not  
she finds a job. That deadline is near for Charla Milton. Unable to find  
work, she is terrified."
<P>
On ABC's World News Tonight, Peter Jennings suggested: "Maybe if he is  
reelected, Mr. Clinton will do something to reverse himself on welfare  
reform. Many of these delegates hope so." ABC reporter Erin Hayes asked  
where the jobs would come from to support welfare recipients: "An Urban  
League study found in Chicago there are six times as many people who  
need work as there are entry-level jobs available." Hayes aired no  
voices favoring welfare reform, and concluded: "There is another concern  
as well: the young children. When their mothers are made to go to work,  
who will take care of them? Right now, no one really has an answer. With  
so much still uncertain about welfare reform, it is no wonder there is  
fear out there."
<P>
CBS reporter Harry Smith also ignored taxpayers and focused on victims  
on the CBS Evening News: "We talked to four welfare moms from across  
Chicago. They feel like they are this year's political  
target...President Clinton seemed deaf to protests last week when he  
signed the new welfare cuts into law. Cuts many Americans support, but  
cuts these women think go too far." Smith concluded: "Neighborhoods like  
Cabrini-Green have more than their share of misery. Folks around here  
think misery is only going to grow. Their long faith in the Democratic  
Party has been shaken, and the actions of President Clinton confirm  
their fear that the poor just do not count."

<H4>Democratic Harshness</H4>
<DD>Democrats blame the GOP for harsh personal attacks, but on the August 26  
Good Morning America co-host Charlie Gibson asked Senator Christopher  
Dodd: "You said the other day that `I got the word out,' that I don't  
want to hear personal attacks against the Republicans at this  
convention. Yesterday on his train trip the President accused  
Republicans of blackmail to get their budget. Al Gore, yesterday,  
accused the Republicans of ignorance and audacity, talked about the  
two-headed monster of Dole and Gingrich. Dick Gephardt, the leader of  
the House, of the Democrats, talked about Republican extremism, said  
they're radicals. Talk about getting the word out?"
<P>
<H4>Labor's Power Ties</H4>

<DD>The labor unions didn't get the Darth Vader treatment reserved in San  
Diego for the Christian Coalition, but in Chicago there were a few  
critical looks at union power.

<DD>CNN campaign finance reporter Brooks Jackson delivered a story on the  
unions' political campaign in which he observed: "So Bill Clinton says  
the era of big government is over? Not at the Democratic convention,  
where unionized government workers are suiting up for battle against  
Republicans."
<DD>On World News Tonight August 27, ABC's Brian Ross reported: "In the  
world of big money and Democratic politics on public display this week  
in Chicago, this man holds a special place. His name is Arthur Coia, who  
despite being president of a labor union the FBI says has long been  
controlled by the Mafia, the Laborers International has become one of  
the Democrats' top money people, raising millions and gaining him  
special access to the Clinton White House....In the last two years, the  
Clinton administration has gone all-out to court Coia and his union  
money with invitations to the White House and an appearance by the First  
Lady at a big union conference."
<DD>Ross added detail: "In an abrupt change of plans that raised questions  
about whether the union's money to the Democrats had bought it some kind  
of sweetheart deal, prosecutors dropped the allegations and instead  
quietly negotiated a deal with Coia that let him keep his job and put  
him in charge of cleaning up the union."

<h2>The Spin: Both Parties Too Conservative</h2>
<P>
<H4>TV Analysts Label Democrats Twice As Often, But Fire Mostly Liberal Questions in Chicago</H4>
<P>
<DD>The networks had big news from the Democratic convention in Chicago: 
liberals exist in the Democratic Party, and they didn't like President 
Clinton's decision to sign a welfare reform bill. From both the 
Republican and Democratic conventions, the networks relayed the same 
message: the parties had become too conservative.
<P>
<DD>During the Chicago convention:
<UL>
<LI><a href="#label">(1)</a> Democratic delegates, speakers, and candidates were labeled twice as often as the Republicans were in San Diego, although they were labeled as extreme only one-fourth as often; 
<LI><a href="#questions">(2)</a> Reporters and anchors posed almost five times as many questions from the left as from the right, a much more liberal questioning agenda than the Democratic convention four years ago; and 
<LI><a href="#welfare">(3)</a> the controversy over welfare reform dominated the convention story line, while the Democrats' abortion-on-demand stance and exclusion of some pro-life speakers garnered no network mentions in prime time.
</UL>
<DD>As during the Republican convention, MediaWatch analysts watched live 
prime-time coverage of the Democratic convention for a special daily 
Media Reality Check '96 newsletter. Analysts watched all ABC, CBS, and 
NBC prime time coverage, as well as the combined PBS/NBC broadcast and 
CNN starting at 8 pm Eastern time.
<P>
<a name="label">
<B>Labeling</B>
<P>
<DD>Previous convention studies in 1984, 1988, and 1992 found the 
Republicans were tagged as conservative or very conservative far more 
often than the Democrats were called liberal or very liberal, with 
reporters instead playing up the moderate nature of Democratic 
candidates and delegates. In 1992, Republicans drew 131 labels, 118 (90 
percent) of them conservative; the Democrats had 89 labels, 51 (57 
percent) of them moderate or conservative.
<P>
<DD>In 1996, the Republicans were labeled only 59 times, 46 of them (78 
percent) conservative; while the Democrats were labeled twice as often, 
on 119 occasions, and 75 of those tags (63 percent) were liberal, to 
only 44 moderate or conservative labels. The Republicans were still four 
times as likely to be described as extreme as the Democrats -- 16 to 4 
-- but the Democrats were never described as extremely liberal in 1992.
<P>
<DD>ABC (with three moderate/conservative labels and 15 liberal tags) was 
the network most willing to underline the liberal nature of the party 
gathered in Chicago, while CBS (8 moderate/conservative, 10 liberal) CNN 
(13-20), NBC-PBS (15-24), and NBC (5-6) held to a more traditional 
percentage of moderate labeling. Labeling decreased nightly -- from 40 
on Monday, to 35 on Tuesday, to 13 on Wednesday -- and then jumped back 
up to 31 on Thursday, when the departure of Dick Morris spurred 
speculation about Clinton's post-Morris ideological positioning.
<P>
<DD>In 1992, Bill Clinton, Al Gore, and the Democratic platform were never 
described as liberal. In 1996, Clinton was described as moderate on 28 
occasions and liberal on 16 occasions, but almost always as a tactical 
function of "moving to the left" or "moving to the right." In San Diego, 
the Republican platform was described as conservative on six occasions; 
in Chicago, the platform was described as moderate on six occasions. 
<P>
<I>Some examples of labeling:</I>
<P>
<DD>As the Republican convention began on August 12, PBS anchor Charlayne 
Hunter-Gault told former Sen. Howard Baker: "Pat Buchanan said most of 
his views, most of Senator Dole's views, were consistent with his own, 
and he cited specifically, affirmative action, and the platform position 
of illegal immigration. And as you know, Pat Buchanan is on the farthest 
extreme of the right wing of the party."
<P>
<DD>CNN reporter Gene Randall declared on August 13: "With me is Phyllis 
Schlafly, an ardent anti-abortion rights advocate...Do you think the 
speakers do not reflect the conservatism of the platform?"
<P>
<DD>CNN's Bob Franken explained the next night: "It's interesting they just 
had a minute ago a very brief tribute to the Republican freshmen in the 
House of Representatives. Why brief? Because they are highly, highly 
controversial. It's the freshmen in the House of Representatives that 
really gave Bill Clinton the extremist issue, fairly or unfairly."
<P>
<DD>In Chicago on August 26, ABC's Sam Donaldson explained the Democrats 
"want to accomplish the same thing the Republicans accomplished -- 
showing a unified party, even though we know from our survey that these 
delegates are far to the left of the mainstream just as the Republican 
delegates were to the right of the mainstream."
<P>
<DD>That night on CBS, Dan Rather asked Jesse Jackson: "Bill Clinton's been 
running pretty hard to the right, so far that some Democrats now call 
him a `Republicrat.' Do you go that far?"
<P>
<DD>Tom Brokaw put Clinton and Gore in Newt Gingrich territory: "Since 1994 
they have slid across the political spectrum to really right of center. 
And they've got a guy by the name of Dick Morris who's advising them on 
a daily basis how to be more pragmatic."
<P>
<DD>Three nights later, Brokaw exemplified post-Morris speculation in asking 
James Carville: "He was the man who moved him to the right. I know that 
you had some philosophical differences with Dick Morris. Does this mean 
that the door has been opened again for those of you who believe that 
the President probably ought to move a little more left of center?"
<P>
<a name="questions">
<B>Agenda Questions</B>
<P>
<DD>The bottom dropped out on agenda questions from the right in 1996. In 
1992, Republicans were asked 130 questions from the left, while 
Democrats were asked only 38 from the right. Actually, Democrats were 
asked more questions from the left (45) than the right (38).
<P>
<DD>In 1996, network reporters asked Republicans 51 questions from the left, 
and only six from the right. Thanks to welfare reform, the pattern in 
Chicago was almost exactly the same: 47 questions from the left, 11 from 
the right.
<P>
<DD>In Chicago, ABC asked only two liberal questions and one conservative 
question, followed by NBC with just three liberal questions and one 
conservative.
<P>
<DD>CBS (12 liberal, zero conservative), CNN (13-2), and NBC-PBS (17-7) 
clearly preferred a menu of questions from the left. Combine both 
conventions, and the questioning numbers are more stark: ABC (five 
liberal, one conservative), CBS (20-3), CNN (23-3), NBC-PBS (37-8), and 
NBC (13-2). Some examples of agenda questions: 
<UL>
<LI><I>From the right to Republicans:</I> CNN's Gene Randall asked New York Gov. George Pataki on August 13: "The focus tonight of course is on the keynote speech and that is by Representative [Susan] Molinari, who it's well known favors abortion rights. Do you sense a dissatisfaction on this floor that she will be giving this address?"
<LI><I>From the left to Republicans:</I> CNN's Judy Woodruff inquired of Rep. Susan Molinari on August 12: "Leading up to the convention, Bob Dole was running well behind President Clinton with women voters. We look at the statistics of how many women delegates. What, 43 percent in 1992. Only 36 percent of delegates are women this year. What sort of signal does that send the country, you think?"
<LI><I>From the right to Democrats:</I> NBC's David Bloom asked James Carville after Hillary Clinton's speech August 27: "I was struck by the fact that she talked about health care and the need for more health care insurance for the unemployed. That's a topic that got her and Bill Clinton into a lot of trouble two years ago. Why would she revisit that tonight?"
<LI><I>From the left to Democrats:</I> ABC's Michel McQueen asked former DNC official Lynn Cutler on August 26: "She is comparing her candidate not to perfection, but to Bob Dole. Isn't that right, Lynn -- do the liberals in the party, as you unashamedly describe yourself, feel abandoned by the President this year?"
</UL>
<a name="welfare">
<B>Controversy: Welfare</B>
<P>
<DD>The controversy over welfare reform surfaced in prime time on 44 
occasions (questions plus comments by reporters), forming the most 
common basis for liberal analysis. As in agenda questions, ABC (4) and 
NBC (2) did not dwell very much on the welfare controversy, and NBC-PBS 
raised it 10 times in a longer time frame. CNN (16) and CBS (9) were 
most interested in the story.
<P>
<DD>Tom Brokaw provided the only example found of coming at the issue from 
the right, even if it sounded like he wished some lesser welfare reform 
had passed before the GOP takeover of Congress. He asked HHS Secretary 
Donna Shalala: "I guess the question a lot of us have is why didn't you 
come up with something of your own two years ago when you had power in 
the Congress, before Newt Gingrich and the Republicans took over, when 
you knew that Repub -- welfare reform was a high-priority issue for this 
country and the President was talking about it when he was running in 
1992?"
<P>
<DD>Brokaw also asked a more typical network question: "If you were a poor 
single mother in a poor rural state in America, without many resources, 
and you wanted to go to work, you want to do the right things, but there 
aren't too many jobs for people who have real skills. Wouldn't you be 
slightly terrified looking into the next two years?"
<P>
<DD>CBS reporter Ed Bradley questioned far-left Rep. Ron Dellums on August 
29: "Congressman Dellums was unhappy when the President signed the 
welfare bill. I know you saw it not as welfare reform but more as a 
budget cut. What does he have to do to fix it?" Bradley followed up: 
"When the President is expected to say tonight that he's going to 
propose a $3.5 billion jobs program for welfare recipients, is that 
enough?"
<P>
<DD>Judy Woodruff pleaded with Hillary Clinton to intervene with her husband 
in six questions of an August 27 interview: "We were just reminded in 
that moving film that we saw here of your lifelong work as an advocate 
for children's causes. And yet, late last week, your husband signed a 
welfare reform bill that as you know, Senator Patrick Moynihan and other 
welfare experts are saying is going to throw a million children into 
poverty. Does that legislation undo so much of what you've worked for 
over the years?"

<h2>60 Minutes Does a 180 on Dole</h2>
<P>
<H4>Rather Asks Clinton If GOP's Extreme, Stahl Raps Dole for Criticizing Hillary</H4>
<P>
<DD>Labor Day weekend marks the start of the campaign season, and this year 
the 60 Minutes interviews with the two presidential candidates 
demonstrated how it also corresponds with another season of tilted 
coverage. 
<P>
<DD>In his August 18 interview with Bill Clinton, Dan Rather wasn't as 
interested in posing questions as setting up speeches: "Some of your 
staff members, not by name, have been saying, `Yes, the President thinks 
Bob Dole is a nice person and has been a pretty good leader in some 
ways,' but, say they, `he's been captured by the extremists in the 
Republican Party, the radical part of the Republican Party, including 
Newt Gingrich.' Is that what you think?"
<P>
<DD>Rather then led Clinton through a set of GOP convention speeches. He 
showed Dole charging Clinton led "a core of elites who never grew up, 
did anything real, never sacrificed, never suffered, and never learned." 
He played video of Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison mentioning the FBI files, 
and George Bush on the White House being "diminished" since his wife 
left.
<P>
<DD>When Clinton's response wasn't strong enough, Rather added: "I don't 
know of anyone in the convention who didn't take that as a difference of 
the present First Lady and the former First Lady." Rather insisted: 
"Don't you get mad, Mr. President, when this sort of thing happens?"
<P>
<DD>Two weeks later Lesley Stahl interviewed Bob Dole. But in her September 
1 talk she gave Dole less time to react to attacks. Stahl didn't suggest 
Clinton is too far to the left and when Dole complained about unfair 
attacks, she made him defend his criticisms. Rather never argued with 
Clinton, but Stahl debated the advisability of Dole's tax cut plan.
<P>
<DD>Stahl began by underlining the Democrats' decency: "At the Democratic 
convention, a lot of Democrats were saying that Bob Dole is a good and 
decent man, and even Bill Clinton made a point of saying Bob Dole loves 
his country. I'm wondering what you think of Bill Clinton. What kind of 
a man do you think he is?"
<P>
<DD>When Dole complained about Democratic attacks, Stahl aired a convention 
clip of Al Gore saying Dole voted against creating Medicare and 
Medicaid, Peace Corps and Head Start. She assumed such votes would have 
been wrong: "Did you really vote against all these things?" Then she 
turned on Dole, asking: "They say that you were unfair in what you said 
about Hillary....Do you think you were unfair in what you said to her?"
<P>
<DD>Stahl made Dole respond to 11 inquiries doubting the tax cut. She 
demanded he explain how he's going to pay for it, contending that in 
the '80s he was correct to oppose Reaganomics: "You were right, it did 
explode the deficit."

<h2>Poor Hillary, Is It Worth It?</h2>
<P>
<H4>Media Disdain GOP's "Bitter Attacks"</H4>
<P>
<DD>During the week of the Democratic convention the three networks got a 
chance to interview First Lady Hillary Clinton, but their favorite topic 
was the First Lady's role as the beleaguered martyr of unfortunate 
Republican attacks.
<P>
<DD>On Monday, CNN's Judy Woodruff went first: "Let me take you back to San 
Diego. Bob Dole said it doesn't take a village, a collective, the state, 
which he said has made mistakes in raising children, it takes a family. 
Is this something that is going to become a major issue in this fall 
campaign?"
<P>
<DD>Woodruff inquired: "Also in San Diego, former President George Bush told 
the delegates he `worked hard,' I'm quoting here, `to uphold the dignity 
and the honor of the presidency, to treat it with respect. And then he 
added, quote, `it breaks his heart, when the White House is demeaned, 
the presidency diminished.' Does that hurt coming from your immediate 
predecessor?"
<P>
<DD>Woodruff kept going: "He then went on, Mrs. Clinton, he made a point of 
saying that his wife, Mrs. Bush, quote, `unquestionably upheld the honor 
of the White House.' Is that an insult to you?" When Mrs. Clinton failed 
to answer sharply enough, Woodruff insisted: "But he was clearly drawing 
a contrast there...you're not hurt?"
<P>
<DD>Stories of Mrs. Clinton's rough-house approach to politics, such as her 
reported role in firing and lodging criminal accusations against seven 
workers of the White House Travel Office, did not prevent CBS This 
Morning co-host Jose Diaz-Balart from asking on August 26: "In the San 
Diego Republican convention, you were the subject of much conversation, 
and I think the target, I think many would say, of some very serious 
attacks....Do you ever, seriously, in the White House, when all the 
doors are closed, do you ever say `Is this worth it'?"
<P>
<DD>Just after she left the podium, NBC's Maria Shriver asked her: "This has 
been a difficult couple of years for you. Did that applause, the way 
you've been treated here, the way people have been reacting to you, kind 
of make it all go away?" And: "You are credited with really redefining 
the role of First Lady and for doing that, you've taken a lot of heat, a 
lot of criticism. As you look back, do you wished you'd redefined it a 
little less?"
<P>
<DD>On CBS, Bob Schieffer inquired of her: "Weren't you a little offended 
when he [Bob Dole] made the reference he did [to your book]?" CNN's Wolf 
Blitzer echoed: "What goes through your mind when you hear some of these 
bitter attacks against you?"

<h2>News Bites</h2>
<CENTER><h3>From the October 1996 Media Watch</h3></CENTER>
<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>Extreme Agreement.</B> 
<P>
Tagging Republican House freshmen as extremists is Democratic mantra. And, it's an
assessment endorsed by CBS News. On the October 10 Evening News, Bob Schieffer examined the Ohio re-match between GOP rookie Frank Cremeans and the man he beat in 1994, Democrat Ted Strickland. Schieffer found a GOP official who thought Newt Gingrich had gone "too far" and asked him a question that incorporated the Democratic spin on last year's budget showdown: "Where did he make his mistake? In shutting down the government?" Strickland insisted that "people want moderation and when extremes are presented, whether they be from the left or the right, I think people have a tendency to turn away from that." Schieffer then concluded by endorsing the "extreme" assessment: "Obvious perhaps, but as Fall comes to the heartland and the election draws near, dozens of Republican freshmen are running scared, wondering if it's a lesson they learned in time."
<P>
<B>Crediting Clinton. </B>
<P>
For the media, bad news is usually good news. Right? Well, not when the good news helps Bill Clinton. On June 30, The New York Times reported that "the share of national income earned by the top five percent of households grew at a faster rate than during the eight years of the Reagan administration, which was often characterized as favoring the rich." ABC's World News Tonight ran no story. But on September 26, when the Census Bureau reported that median income had risen as poverty fell, who got the credit? Bill Clinton.
<P>
Reporter Barry Serafin reported that median income grew 2.7 percent, but remained lower than 1989. Serafin started his story: "The number of Americans living in poverty fell. There were 36.4 million people below the poverty level, 1.6 million fewer than the year before. The poverty rate for African-Americans dropped to its lowest level since 1959, 29.3 percent.
<P>
What does it add up to?"
<P>
Following a soundbite from Clinton, Serafin continued: "Citing the income gains, the
President declared that the country is on the right track. He heralded progress on narrowing
the gap between the richest and poorest Americans." Serafin used a single expert source for
his story, a professor from MIT. Whom did the professor credit? Clinton and Fed Chairman
Alan Greenspan. Serafin closed the story: "All in all the new numbers added to a very good
day for Bill Clinton." Thanks to ABC.
<P>
<B>Gore: Too Important to Criticize.  </B>
<P>
If you are powerful enough to get between a microphone and Clinton then you're personal
hypocrisy doesn't matter. At least that's what a CBS story portrayed. 

During the Democratic convention in Chicago Vice President Al Gore was widely praised by reporters for his emotional attack of tobacco by highlighting his sister's death from lung
cancer in 1984. On CBS Bob Schieffer called it "a barnburner." However, reporters failed to recognize that in 1988, four years after his sister died, Gore made an enthusiastic appeal to voters in tobacco states by stressing his own efforts in growing tobacco. 
<P>
The October 3 CBS Evening News included a profile of Gore by Rita Braver. For the first
time, CBS viewers heard about Gore's hypocrisy, but Braver excused him."He's in on every key White House meeting and decision. Just last month in his role as environmental guru, Gore convinced the President to create a controversial national monument in Utah. Of late, Republicans have attacked him for making a convention speech about his sister's death from lung cancer caused by smoking...While for several years after her death he let tobacco be grown on land he owned." But instead of seeing this as a character flaw, Braver relayed Gore's spin about how he "dismisses that attack as politics, an attempt to sully a man so close to the President he feels free to interrupt him." Viewers then saw video of Gore stepping in front of Clinton at a microphone. 
<P>
<B>Media to Dole: Just Stay Home. </B>
<P>
Is it wrong for a presidential candidate to address an ideological political organization?
Only if it's a conservative one.
<P>
When Bob Dole spoke September 14 to the Christian Coalition, on the NBC Nightly News David Bloom was concerned: "Dole decided only this morning to speak to the Christian Coalition despite worries inside his campaign that a bow to the religious right might send the wrong message to moderate, swing voters....Clinton's campaign spokesman said in a statement:
`Watching Bob Dole arm in arm with Pat Robertson speaks volumes to the extreme agenda being pursued by the Dole-Kemp-Gingrich team.' A top Clinton campaign official was all smiles, saying, `if you see Dole, tell him thanks for me.'" 
<P>
But although Clinton was not criticized for refusing to speak at the same Coalition meeting, NBC cast in racial terms Dole's July 10 decision to decline the NAACP's speaking invitation. Back then reporter Jim Miklaszewski claimed the group considered it <blockquote>
"an insult to African-American voters....By not showing up here, Bob Dole may reinforce those racial divides along party lines and fuel the anxiety among some Republicans that in this presidential campaign, Bob Dole may not be up to the challenge." 
</blockquote>
<P>
<B>Christian Contradiction. </B>
<P>
Following David Bloom's piece chastising Dole's  Christian Coalition speech, Brian Williams claimed the Coalition was "no longer the lone voice for conservative Christians." What new group of conservative Christians had NBC discovered?
<P>
Bob Abernethy described a group "uncomfortable" with the Coalition's "partisanship and with what seems to many critics its divisiveness and its neglect of the poor." Abernethy
described the new group's agenda as a "new kind of political action that defends the poor
and brings people together." But at their convention, they "heard from children right's
advocate Marian Wright Edelman," and Christian Marxist Jim Wallis. 
<P>
The group, Call To Renewal, hardly fits Williams' "conservative" label. Yet Abernethy didn't apply a single liberal label, even though "children's advocate" Edelman's speech garnered applause for this line: "Let's guarantee a job. Let's guarantee health care and children care. Let's turn this welfare repeal into real welfare reform." 
<P>
Abernethy simply described Wallis as "Reverend," but in the past Wallis has voiced hope that "more Christians will view the world through Marxist eyes." By failing to disclose Call To Renewal's ideological agenda, Abernethy committed sin by omission. 
<P>
<B>Media Flew the Koop. </B>
<P>
Former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop endorsed the Clinton health care scheme early on, making him a ubiquitous presence on the networks. Koop made news again when he criticized Bob Dole for suggesting nicotine is not addictive. He appeared on Good Morning America and was featured in stories on other networks castigating Dole. In the infamous July interview in which Dole and Katie Couric sparred over liberal bias, Couric cited Koop: "C. Everett Koop is pretty nonpartisan wouldn't you say? He criticized you quite severely for your comments. You're saying the liberal media had a problem but even Dr. Koop had a problem."
<P>
But when Koop criticized President Clinton for vetoing in April the partial-birth abortion
ban passed by Congress, he fell into TV's memory hole. The former Surgeon General did not appear on any network to talk about his condemnation of the President. The lesson? When a nationally known figure announces he is for a liberal proposal, he is much in demand by the media. When the same figure comes out in support of a conservative cause, the media silence is overwhelming. 
<P>
<B>Dole Behind: Blame Conservatives. </B>
<P>
Conservatives argue that Bob Dole's lack of identity with issues that excite conservatives
explained why he failed to early on secure his Republican base. But more than a month before the election, ABC's Dean Reynolds instead assigned Dole's low standing in the polls to his being "too conservative." For the September 23 World News Tonight Reynolds traveled to Lansing, Michigan where he found that "many of the voters we spoke with blame Gingrich for last year's government shutdown, for a  would be the environmental President and today he went to the Grand Canyon. It was a trip critics charged was nothing more than grand standing." Reporter Ann Compton opened her story: "This morning there was only a slight haze drifting through the Grand Canyon, so the South Rim was a picture perfect spot for President Bush to claim an environmental victory, but on many days smog from a nearby power plant makes it impossible to see across to the Canyon walls just two miles away." Who did Compton use for a soundbite? Then Senator Al Gore.
<P>
What a difference a President makes. When President Clinton and Vice President Gore visited the Grand Canyon exactly five years later to designate 1.7 million acres in Southern Utah as a national monument, no network used this photo op as a chance to tear apart Clinton's environmental record, quite the contrary. On the CBS Evening News, reporter Rita Braver started her story: 
<blockquote>"With Al `Earthman' Gore by his side, the President signed a bill
designating 1.7 million acres of land 70 miles away in Utah as the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument." 
</blockquote>
ABC's Sam Donaldson was no different: 
<blockquote>"Dressed in appropriate western attire, boots and blue blazers, the top guns of the Democratic team came to the South Rim of the Grand Canyon to make points as conservationists."

<B>Clinton's Character Off Limits--
Networks Declare Dole Criticisms "Mean," "Harsh" and "Nasty"</b> 
<P>
The networks spent early October on referee patrol for Bill Clinton, ruling out of bounds
anything critical or negative about him. <I>World News Tonight</I> anchor Forest Sawyer announced October 3: 
<blockquote>"Bob Dole decided to step onto center stage with a harshly worded attack not only on the administration's work in the Middle East, but its entire foreign policy....The administration has so far answered softly." The "soft" response? ABC didn't show it, but Clinton Press Secretary Mike McCurry retorted that Dole advisers are "nattering naysayers of gloom."
</blockquote>
<P>
MSNBC's <I>The News</I> with Brian Williams that night showed new ads from the Dole and Clinton campaigns: "We're going to begin with the latest ad from the Dole campaign which takes the campaign into a bit of nasty territory." Dole's ad simply showed clips of Clinton talking about taxes to illustrate he's really a liberal. Williams failed to tag the Clinton ad as
"nasty," but it included this negative attack line: "Dole and Gingrich tried to slash school
anti-drug programs. They'd take us back."
<P>
Bozo became the big news on October 8. A man in a crowd yelled at Dole that he should "get Bozo out of the White House." Dole shot back: "Bozo's on his way out." CNN's Bernard Shaw opened <I>Inside Politics</I>: "Was he borrowing the words of an over-enthusiastic supporter, or did Bob Dole lower the level of civility a notch in his contest with Bill Clinton?"
<P>
On the next morning's Today, Katie Couric asked NBC's Tim Russert: "As you've heard Tim it turned decidedly nastier in the Dole camp yesterday. He was talking about a moral crisis. He refused to answer a question if President Clinton was morally and ethically capable of being President. You heard that Bozo exchange. Effective strategy or is this going to come back to haunt him?" Swift network condemnation followed Dole's October 14 decision to raise the ethics issue. On NBC <I>Nightly News</I> David Bloom declared: "In his harshest, most personal attack yet on the President, Bob Dole today charged that the Clinton Administration is unethical, that Bill Clinton himself is slipping and sliding away from questions about possible illegal campaign contributions." The next day Dole again discussed what he termed "public ethics," leading CBS reporter Phil Jones to worry that Dole "runs the risk of looking desperate and mean-spirited."
<P>
Dole's speech prompted Matt Lauer to begin his <I>Today</I> newscast on October 16, the morning of the second debate: "Bob Dole is not waiting for that debate to attack Bill Clinton's ethics. With more on a campaign that is now getting meaner, NBC's Kelly O'Donnell is standing by live."

<B>Media Scoff at Far Right...Buy Wacky Left</B>
<P>
While the media are quick to dismiss crazy right-wing conspiracy theories about black U.N. helicopters they granted credence to the charge that the CIA introduced crack into black Los Angeles neighborhoods as a way to fund the Nicaraguan Contras. The theory was forwarded in an August San Jose Mercury News series by reporter Gary Webb. The four major networks aired a total of 12 stories with CBS laying claim to five. CNN ran three followed by ABC and NBC which aired two stories each. 
<P>
ABC's Good Morning America and CBS This Morning brought on far-left U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters. She pushed the charge as proof that outside forces created urban drug addicts. CBS's Bill Whitaker accepted the charge and placed the plight of crack babies at the feet of the CIA. His October 1 Evening News piece opened with a shot of woman holding a crying baby:
<blockquote>
"The decade and a half crack epidemic has exacted a ruinous toll. For ten years Eloise
Dangerfield has been rescuing the littlest victims, crack babies, from the death grip in
which the drug has ensnared much of South Central Los Angeles....So when L.A.'s black
citizens heard of the San Jose Mercury News reports claiming CIA backed Contras opened the first pipeline for Colombian cocaine to their communities their first reaction: shock. Their second: anger." 
</blockquote>
Whitaker aired a soundbite from Webb's source, a drug dealer, but offered this ambiguous defense of the CIA: 
<blockquote>"There is no evidence directly linking the CIA to the drug sales and the CIA says its own internal investigation has found no connection. Yet here at Ground Zero of the crack explosion the story simply won't go away." 
</blockquote>
<P>
He ended with more emotion over reason:
<P>
<blockquote>
"Eloise Dangerfield says it is all too horrible to contemplate. Knowing might ease the pain,
she says, but it won't end the suffering."
</blockquote>
<P>
In the September 30 Weekly Standard Tucker Carlson questioned Webb's reporting: 
<P>
<blockquote>
"Webb came up with no evidence to support his claim ....Instead of actual evidence, Webb relies on a series of unrelated events to show a conspiracy was afoot." Carlson noted that Sen. John Kerry's two year investigation failed to prove CIA involvement. "Indeed ample evidence surfaced that CIA officials had worked to remove drug traffickers from the Nicaraguan resistance."

<BR>
<B>Wall of Denial Breaks Down--Media Actually Admit Bias</B>
<P>
Sam Donaldson, USA Today's Richard Benedetto and the Chairman of CBS all agree: the media are biased. 
<P>
With Brit Hume out ill for a few days, Donaldson returned to the campaign trail for the
first time since Reagan's years. And he found things have changed, USA Today's Peter Johnson reported September 23: "Have the boys on the bus lost the fire in their bellies, the one that fueled their cries of `Mr. President! Mr. President!' during President Reagan's years in office? ABC's Sam Donaldson isn't saying, exactly, but suspects something's going on.
<P>
Except for CBS' Rita Braver, `I have heard no reporter trying to ask the President any
question,' Donaldson said....
<P>
"What's this, Sam? Reporters going easy on Clinton? `You're not going to get me in a fight with these guys. They're my friends,' said Donaldson, who covered the White House from 1977 to 1989. `But there seems to a change in attitude or a different attitude toward covering the President.'"
<P>
A USA Today reporter concurs. In his "Politics" column the same day, Richard Benedetto
wrote: "As President Clinton's re-election campaign rolled through six states in four days
last week, it did so virtually unimpeded by a White House press corps known for setting up roadblocks now and then....He was left free to make a string of feel-good speeches that won great play in the media and gave the desired impression that the Clinton campaign is on a roll.... "In 1992, a tough White House press corps rightly kept President Bush's feet to the fire on domestic issues he would rather have downplayed. But the 1996 crew appears less aggressive with Clinton."
<P>
The realization of media bias extends to the top of CBS. Michael Jordan, the Chairman of
Westinghouse, parent of CBS, revealed in a magazine profile that he agrees with CBS reporter Bernard Goldberg's charge that network reporting tilts left.
<P>
In a Wall Street Journal op-ed back in February Goldberg cited a specific CBS story to
support his contention that "the old argument that the networks and other 'media elites'
have a liberal bias is so blatantly true that it's hardly worth discussing anymore." CBS
reaction at the time: "It's such a wacky charge," commented a baffled Bob Schieffer. CBS
News President Andrew Heyward called the charge "absurd," took Goldberg off the air for two months and then canceled his bylined CBS Evening News feature, "Bernard Goldberg's America."
<P>
In the Summer Forbes MediaCritic, Terry Eastland found that in a May <i>USAir Magazine</i> profile, Jordan sided with Goldberg: "I think his criticism is fair. I think all the networks can do a better job at providing a more objective and balanced perspective." Now, if only Jordan would put his concerns into action.

<CENTER><H2>Networks Blackout Clinton's Bad News</H2>
<H3>Revelation After Revelation Reported by Newspapers, But Never Make TV News</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<BR>
On September 26, the House ethics committee announced it would expand an investigation of Speaker Newt Gingrich's college course "Renewing American Civilization." ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC reported the story, ultimately adding up to eleven broadcast network morning and evening segments in five days. The next morning, NBC's Today led off with an interview with NBC Washington Bureau Chief Tim Russert, who proclaimed: "It's awful, it's serious, it's potentially devastating." On October 8, Today's Matt Lauer asked Gingrich six questions about ethics, including two about whether Gingrich would resign. But a MediaWatch review of recent scoops on the Clinton administration's character shows a much different approach to stories which could damage Democrats.   
<P>
<BR>
<B>September 23:</B> The Federal Deposit Insurance
Corporation's inspector general concluded that Hillary Clinton had drafted a real estate
document with the intent to "deceive" federal regulators. That real estate transaction, a
sham deal selling a property named Castle Grande to a straw buyer, later cost taxpayers $4 million in the bailout of Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan. The Washington Post put the news on its September 24 front page. Network coverage? Nothing -- until October 4, when NBC's Jim Miklaszewski mentioned it in a Nightly News story on a speech by independent counsel Ken Starr: "Whitewater prosecutor Kenneth Starr was invited to appear by outspoken Clinton critic Pat Robertson and the audience was very conservative. The White House claims that's proof Starr is out to get Clinton for political reasons, but Starr says he'll stay the course."
<P>
(ABC and CNN did report the story last February 29, when the FDIC released a more favorable assessment, recommending the FDIC not seek legal recourse against Mrs. Clinton or the Rose Law Firm.)
<P>
<BR>
<B>September 24:</B> A House committee held hearings on charges that the administration has let criminals become citizens. The Washington Times story the next day began: "Immigration workers yesterday told a House Government Reform and Oversight subcommittee of rampant abuses in the Citizenship USA program that apparently let thousands of immigrants with criminal records become citizens." The networks? Zilch until the October 18 CBS Evening News. Also on September 24, a federal jury convicted Sun Diamond Growers, one of the
nation's largest producers of fruits and nuts, of illegally showering former Clinton
Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy with nearly $6,000 in gifts, a conviction for Independent
Counsel Donald Smaltz. The story made The Washington Post front page the next day. Network coverage? Nothing, but The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer on PBS did a brief anchor-read item.
<P>
<BR>
<B>September 25:</B> Sen. Orrin Hatch revealed a six-month gap in the log which listed who at the White House was accessing FBI background files on Republican White House employees. The Washington Times bannered the news across page one the next day. Coverage? A CNN World Today story and a mention on ABC's Good Morning America.
<P>
Also on the 25th, the Times reported that Rep. John Mica (R.-Fla.) sent a letter to
Clinton's "drug czar" demanding release of a four-month-old Institute for Defense Analysis
report that concluded Bush's interdiction policy was far more effective than Clinton's
emphasis on drug treatment. Network coverage? Nothing until a story by David Martin on the October 15 CBS Evening News.

September 26: Three days after President Clinton refused to rule out pardons for Whitewater figures on The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, 170 members of Congress, including three Democrats, sent a letter to the White House demanding Clinton promise not to pardon anyone. The September 29 Washington Times reported that House Democrats were prepared to shut down the government if Republicans demanded a vote on a resolution calling for President Clinton to renounce pardons. Network coverage? With the exception of one general question on the 29th about pardons from CBS Evening News Sunday anchor John Roberts to commentator Laura Ingraham, absolutely nothing until Dole raised the subject later.
<P>
<BR>
<B>October 1:</B> The White House claimed executive privilege to withhold from House investigators a memo to President Clinton from FBI Director Louis Freeh said to be highly critical of federal drug policy. Network response? Zero. 
<P>
<BR>
<B>October 4:</B> Sen. Orrin Hatch released the deposition of White House aide Mari Anderson before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Anderson verified that pages of the log used to record the taking of FBI files were missing. Anderson also asserted, in contra- diction to White House aide Craig Livingstone's assurances, that he knew they were procuring the FBI files of Republicans. Even The Washington Post put this story on its front page the next day. Network coverage? Only CNN, in two Linden Soles anchor-briefs on The World Today, mentioned the news. (ABC's World News Tonight didn't report it, but the revelations were raised in an interview on the October 6 This Week.)
 Also on October 4, former FBI Special Agent Dennis Sculimbrene, who was the senior agent assigned to the White House from 1986 to April 1996, told The Wall Street Journal: "There were senior people as well, senior aides and advisers to the President who used drugs recently -- people in policy positions, or say, the director of an office...Some senior
 people even said they had used drugs as recently as the Inaugural." Sculimbrene estimated that "about 25 percent of the incoming administration, about one out of four cases, had a problem with illegal drugs. Not just casual experimentation, but a pattern of usage." Network coverage? Zero. 
<P>
<BR>
<B>October 10:</B> A House panel investigating the Clinton administration's secret foreign policy initiative to encourage the Iranian government to arm the Bosnian Muslims asked the Justice Department to probe administration officials for possible criminal charges for false statements. Since the Iran-Bosnia secret foreign policy emerged in the Los Angeles Times April 5, CBS and NBC have aired absolutely nothing on the evening news about the story. CNN and ABC aired only anchor briefs, only in the first days of the story. Network coverage for the latest development? Zero.
<P>
On CNN's Crossfire Sept. 20, Chicago Tribune reporter Ellen Warren declared: "Reporters want nothing more, this year and four years ago, to have a horse race. That's what we're in love with, is the fight, the close call....So it's in our interest to make it look close, to make Bob Dole look good." The omissions documented here suggest otherwise.

<B>Clinton: Moral Leader</B>
<P>
The chief White House speechwriter got his job because candidate Bill Clinton so liked his
reporting. In the September 23 Weekly Standard, Christopher Caldwell relayed why chief
speechwriter Donald Baer,  who had been Assistant Managing Editor of U.S. News, was tapped in 1994: "Clinton liked the articles Baer contributed to U.S. News during the 1992 campaign" since "Baer wrote with extreme empathy about Clinton's background."
<P>
Caldwell quoted a journalistic colleague: "'Being of the South and still being rooted there,
yet being driven and ambitious enough to prove oneself in the larger world -- the two of
them have a lot in common.' While Baer has always been a loyal Democrat, he's not
necessarily a liberal. Like Clinton, he has an idiosyncratic, instinctive, generally 
progressive politics that winds up at beyond-left-and-rightism."
<P>
Beyond ideology maybe, but not beyond idolizing Clinton. Caldwell learned: "This enthusiasmcan appear like ideological non-commitment or caginess. One New Democrat who met Baer at a dinner last year described him as `bland beyond description, a fount of cliches. `Clinton was the moral leader of the Universe,' and all that.'"
<P>
<B>Up and Out at U.S. News</B>
<P>
James Fallows took the helm at U.S. News in late September. The new Editor promoted one veteran of Democratic politics while another decided to resign. Now in the number two slot as Managing Editor: Harrison Rainie, an Assistant Managing Editor since 1988 when he jumped from the office of New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan where he had spent most of 1987 as the Democrat's Chief-of-Staff.... 
<P>
Deciding to depart: Kathryn Bushkin, Director of Editorial Administration since 1984 when
she put in a stint as Press Secretary with Gary Hart's presidential effort. Bushkin has
joined a PR firm.
<P>
<B>NBC's on the Mark</B>
<P>
A professional flack for a liberal Senator is the newest member of the on-air reporting team
at the NBC News Washington bureau. Alexandra Marks, Press Secretary to Senator John Kerry
(D-Mass.) from late 1993 to mid-1995, signed on in early September. Before joining Kerry and
again since 1995 Marks worked as a Christian Science Monitor reporter. But she's not new to TV. Prior to flacking for Kerry, Marks reported for the Monitor's since-failed cable channel and for the 10 O'Clock News on WGBH-TV, Boston's PBS station.
<P>
<B>Democratic Cable</B>
<P>
Among the on-air talent brought aboard MSNBC, the new NBC News cable channel in partnership with Microsoft, were a Clinton speechwriter and an aide in a Democratic presidential run.
<P>
Political correspondent Eric Liu composed speeches for Secretary of State Warren Christopher in 1993 before becoming, at age 25, the youngest speechwriter for President Clinton. The New York Times reported that Liu moved to the White House speechwriting office in November 1993 where he toiled until June 1994.... Chip Reid, hired to cover the White House and Capitol Hill, was general counsel in 1987 for Democrat Joe Biden's unsuccessful run. For theprevious four years Reid had been chief investigator for the Senate Judiciary Committee's Democratic Senators. After Biden, Reid accepted a producer slot with ABC News and was a reporter for Washington, D.C.'s ABC affiliate, WJLA, when tapped by MSNBC.

<title>Janet Cooke Award April 1996</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<blockquote>
<center><h2>
Janet Cooke Award <BR>
For the October 1996 Mediawatch. 
</h2></center>

<i>The Janet Cooke Award is given to the most outrageously distorted news story of the month. The award honors the Washington Post reporter who won the Pulitzer Prize for a story later proven completely false.</i>
<p>
<CENTER><B>Clinton Doesn't Get Enough Credit
<BR>
PBS Special Argues Media Out of Touch, But Show Proves PBS Out of Touch with Reality</B>
<P>
</CENTER>
Civility was not the rule at PBS when Frontline asserted the Reagan administration had
funneled drugs into American cities to fund the Contras, that Reagan's CIA attempted to kill Contra leader Eden Pastora, or that the 1980 Reagan campaign conspired to delay the release of the Iranian hostages. Congressional investigations later unraveled these conspiracy theories with no apologies from PBS. But now that Bill Clinton is President, PBS has funded --  without any rebuttal -- Hedrick Smith's four-hour documentary on how Washington works, <B>The People and the Power Game</B>.
<P> 
For devoting his first hour on September 3 to his claim that Bill Clinton has been abused by an uncivil news media, Smith earned the Janet Cooke Award.
Smith began: 
<blockquote>
	"By focusing on scandal and conflict over substance, and by our increasingly
	negative tone, the media has distorted the nation's agenda and lost touch with the 	public we claim to serve." 
</blockquote>
But Smith made only two brief asides about coverage of conservatives: how
reporters drilled Steve Forbes with personal or tactical questions on Meet the Press, while
average people asked questions of substance; and Newt Gingrich complaining about the
"childhood games" reporters played at his press conferences. Smith introduced Gingrich: "A politician on the make knows that the sure way to command press attention is with
sensationalism and extremist polemics. Newt Gingrich, as a junior Congressman, built his
power on media fireworks." The rest of the hour brought example after example of scandalous Clinton coverage, from the supposed $200 haircut with Cristophe on Air Force One, to New York Times reporter Maureen Dowd: "President Clinton returned today for a sentimental journey to the university where he didn't inhale, didn't get drafted, and didn't get a degree." 
<P>
<B>Gennifer Flowers.</B>
<P> 
Smith decried the networks "going with a questionable story that almost felled a future President." Smith never investigated the substance of the Flowers
story, choosing instead to force anchors to defend themselves for even touching it. But
Smith's version was at variance with the actual record. He reported ABC's Jim Wooten asked Clinton about the Star's Flowers story on Thursday, January 23, but decided not to air a story. ABC's local affiliates did -- as did Nightline, which booked three guests decrying the story as tabloid trash. Smith claimed: "By the next day, ABC's <I>World News Tonight</I>, lagging behind its own affiliates, decided to broadcast the story." 
<P>
Smith asked Peter Jennings: "In this instance, you tried it [to check the story out] on the first day, and on the basis of that standard, you didn't run it...With not much different facts the second day, you did run it." Replied Jennings: "Yeah. I think that's a fair and slightly painful characterization for me. But the truth of the matter is that by the second day, we were pretty much swept along by events." Smith then interviewed Dan Rather: "I said `Gosh, I don't have the stomach for doing that. And the first day, even the second day, we said `Nah, not for me.' I mean, frankly, I don't care, and I don't think most viewers care. And then somebody came in and said `Look at this. Last night, one of our major competitors, they went with it, they went with it strong,' and that bridges over from the sleazy press into the mainstream." But any look at the tapes of ABC's World News Tonight demonstrates that they aired no story on January 24, the day after Nightline, but waited until the 27th -- after the Clintons had appeared in an exclusive post-Super Bowl interview on 60 Minutes. And for Rather's version of events -- that a competitor "went with it strong" -- seems strange since he waited until 60 Minutes did the story. Only NBC's Lisa Myers made passing reference to the Flowers story before that.
<P>
<B>Brit Hume</B>.
<P>
 Smith claimed: "The once-cozy relationship between the President and the White
House press corps has dissolved into permanent combat...Increasingly, critics argue, the
balance is out of whack, and the traditional skepticism of the White House press corps has slid into cynicism, where a President's thoughtful deliberation is seen as indecision and compromise as backsliding." What kind of cynical question did Smith have in mind? When Clinton appointed Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the Supreme Court after long considering Stephen Breyer, ABC's Brit Hume asked Clinton: "We may have created an impression, perhaps unfair, of a certain zig-zag in the decision making process here. I wonder if you could walk us through it and perhaps disabuse of any notions we might have along these lines. Thank you." 
<P>
Eric Engberg. The CBS reporter may have been criticized by colleague Bernard Goldberg for attacking Steve Forbes' flat tax, but Smith was only concerned about Clinton: "Critics
contend that Engberg's Reality Checks have gone beyond investigative journalism and become saturated with opinion, almost always negative...Just seven days after Clinton's
inauguration, for example, Engberg was on the air with a Reality Check declaring the infant administration a failure."
<P>
But Engberg's actual report never came close to "declaring the infant administration a
failure." Engberg noted Clinton had not followed through on promises to have plans on the
economy and energy available "on the first day" of his presidency. Engberg also brought up news reports that the White House was considering a gas tax, recalling Clinton ruled out raising taxes on the middle class in 1992. Engberg concluded: "Overall, the first week
showed the President willing to jump into controversies that can slice away some of his
early support. The promise to focus on the economy like a laser seemed to come unstuck in the Washington centrifuge."   

CBS's State of the Union. Smith declared: "CBS and others in the Washington media were
criticized for relying on inside-the-Beltway punditry in their coverage of Clinton's State
of the Union address." The program quoted Joe Klein saying: "It was a very, very long
speech. This guy loves to give long speeches." He left out Klein's next sentence: "But it
was also a very effective one."

Smith rebutted Klein: "But polls showed the public loved it." Where would Smith have learned
that polls showed the public loved it? CBS aired its instant poll results showing that 85
percent "approve of the President's proposals," that 74 percent "now have a clear idea what
President Clinton stands for" and 56 percent said Clinton "better understands the major
problems facing the country today" than the GOP. Rather signed off by repeating all the
pro-Clinton poll results.

Taxpayers fund public broadcasting to be offered an alternative to the commercial networks.
Smith's program shows taxpayers aren't getting an alternative, but are paying for PBS to
scold the media on how they're not liberal enough.

<title>Newsbites -- November 1996 Media Watch</title>
</head>
<body>
<h3>Newsbites from the November 1996 Media Watch</h3>
<p>
<b>California's Clock</b>
<BR>
NBC's Maria Shriv-er and CBS's Jane Robelot laid into the California Civil Rights
Initiative, Proposition 209, after it passed by a wide margin on November 5. The measure
banned the state from awarding preferential treatment to anyone on the basis of race, sex,
or religion -- to liberal reporters, an obvious step backwards. Shriver tossed Jesse Jackson
a loaded softball on election night: "Affirmative action was a hotbed issue in this country,
still a big race on that subject going on about that in California. Did you feel at times
like we've turned back the clock on some of these issues?" On CBS This Morning the next day,
Robelot attacked initiative sponsor Ward Connerly for touting an end  to preferences: "But
that's sort of living in an ideal world. I mean it's nice to say it on paper. If you look
around at corporate offices in America and in CEO's offices, you're gonna see very few
minorities and few women. Are we really ready to backtrack on civil rights now, or on
affirmative action?"
<P>
<b>Gore vs. Gingrich</b>
<BR>
Rarely have the media's double standard toward the two parties been more evident than in the
Today show's interviews in the first week in October. On October 8, substitute co-host Matt
Lauer hit Newt Gingrich with six ethics questions, including: "Do you envision any
circumstances, Mr. Speaker, under which you might be forced to resign based on the
investigation?....So if the ethics committee comes back and says Newt Gingrich was not
truthful with us in supplying information?" Gingrich responded: "I don't think they can say
that." Lauer eagerly countered, "If they did, would you consider resigning?" The next
morning, substitute co-host Ed Gordon tossed bouquets at Al Gore: "Many can see that you
have indeed been the most powerful Vice President in our history. You satisfied with the
role that you played for four years?" And: "The debate is coming up. What do you want people
to come away with, after they watch you and Jack Kemp? What should they know about Al Gore?"
Gordon  also asked: "You want to be the best second guy you can. You're there to help the
President. Now having said that, do you want the job in 2000?"
<P>
<b>Cuddling Carolyn</b> 
<BR>
The national media have never been in love with the National Rifle Association, so when
anti-gun Democrat Carolyn McCarthy beat freshman Republican Rep. Daniel Frisa in New York,
media praise soon followed. The morning after the election, McCarthy made the talk show
rounds. On the November 6 Today, Katie Couric went straight to the NRA: "What do you think
the lesson is for the National Rifle Association? Of course, one of the cornerstones of your
campaign was to maintain the ban on assault weapons in this country." Over on Good Morning
America, ABC's Joan Lunden claimed: "McCarthy turned her rage over the availability of
assault weapons into political activism and last night this ultimate outsider, a former
nurse and homemaker, defeated incumbent Daniel Frisa." After McCarthy, who has never held
political office, made some broad comments about various government programs, Lunden praised
her: "Sounds like you really educated yourself too. Are you at all daunted by this task that
lies before you?" On November 8, World News Tonight picked McCarthy as the Person of the
Week because, as anchor Peter Jennings put it: "We have chosen her because the people who
chose her were so impressed by her notion of public service." McCarthy was the first
politician selected as Person of the Week this year.
<P>
<b>Hating Helen</b>
<BR>
GOP freshman Rep. Helen Chenoweth won re-election despite being targeted by the Democrats,
labor unions, environmentalists and...Tom Brokaw. On the October 24 NBC Nightly News, Brokaw
chose Chenoweth's Idaho congressional race as the subject of his "In Depth" report on big
money from special interests. Brokaw opened: "From sunup til late night, the sounds of
politics are in the air in Idaho like a migraine headache with a voice track. And this is
why: Helen Chenoweth, a controversial first term Republican Congresswoman." When Chenoweth
claimed: "I don't have a clue why they would target me. I come from an innocuous state. I'm
just a plain-spoken Western woman," Brokaw countered: "Not exactly. In her first term
Chenoweth was a cheerleader for the New Right. Voting against an increase in the minimum
wage, trashing traditional environmental organizations. She was a hard-liner on gun laws.
So, she is a target of big labor and conservationists." While Chenoweth was labeled as a
"hard-liner" and portrayed as extreme, her Democratic opponent Dan Williams drew no labeling
from Brokaw, nor was he depicted as being beholden to special interests, despite the
thousands of dollars big labor and liberal environmentalists spent on his behalf.  
<P>
<b>Return of the Gorbasm</b>
<BR>
  <DD>NBC's Tom Brokaw has put Mikhail Gorbachev in his personal pantheon of heroes. On the PBS
  talk show Charlie Rose May 2, Brokaw paid homage: "I think Gorbachev is a great man in the
  20th century because he forced his country to look at the hypocrisy and the fraudulence of
  communism and to begin slowly to make a turn away from it.  He can still light up any room
  that he walks into." Brokaw refused to call Ronald Reagan a great man: "You can look at
  the economics of Reaganism, for example, or some of the bombast of his foreign policy, and
  find all manner of flaws in there."
<BR>
Five months later, on MSNBC's InterNight October 29, Brokaw interviewed Gorbachev,
proclaiming: "It's likely that your view of Mikhail Gorbachev depends on your point of view.
From the perspective of the West, the former President of the Soviet Union of course was a
courageous, far-seeing prophet whose reforms set in motion the collapse of the Soviet
dictatorship and the end of the Cold War." At interview's end, Brokaw gushed: "Perhaps one
day we'll see you again in political office in Russia. We know that you've devoted your life
to peace and to changing your country and those of us who have gotten to know you count
ourselves among the privileged."
<P>
<b>Willie Horton Stalks Cyberspace</b>
<br>
For eight years reporters regularly insisted Republicans used racial issues, as symbolized
by the Willie Horton ad, to divide America in order to win the 1988 presidential campaign.
But this year, raising Willie Horton suddenly had become a symbol of toughness for one
politician. In a VP debate preview piece posted October 8 on the CNN website
AllPolitics.com, reporters Bob Franken and Marc Watts applauded the use of Willie Horton by
Al Gore in 1988: "Gore can also fire off the tough question. In 1988, as a Senator, he first
raised what became known as the `Willie Horton issue' with Michael Dukakis during a primary
debate." A dimmer view was advanced by CNN in a February 1992 special on race and the
presidential campaigns. CNN reporter Ken Bode sounded off about the pro-George
Bush independent expenditure ads featuring Willie Horton: "David Duke's exploitation of white
working class fears about blacks echoes a theme from the 1988 election. This is the Maryland
State Penitentiary. Inside resides the most politically notorious convict in America.
William Horton, Jr., the focal point of a major national campaign designed to exploit white
fear of black crime....The Horton case illustrates the readiness of political leaders to
exploit the racial divide."
<P>
<b>Peter's Slippery Science</b>
<BR>
Scientific studies usually get a respectful hearing -- unless reporters disagree with the
results. Take Peter Jennings  on the October 11 World News Tonight: "There was a study
released at Penn State University today that you may hear a lot about this weekend. It
purports to show a connection between women who have had abortions and the risk of
developing breast cancer. And if you see it around, remember this. It is not original
research, but an analysis of 23 earlier studies. And the National Cancer Institute says
those individual studies were actually inconclusive, and  because of that, various other
scientists say today the Penn State report is flawed." Some criticism of the study attacked
the author, Joel Brind, who is personally opposed to abortion. 
<P>
 But in the past Jennings has had no such doubts about the validity of meta-analysis, a
 method of research which draws conclusions by combining data from other studies. In a
 syndicated column, Reason magazine Science Editor Michael Fumento pointed out that a 1991
 report, by Dr. Stanton Glantz, an anti-smoking activist and founder of the American
 Nonsmoker's Rights Foundation, found a "30 percent increased risk," the same factor of
 increase as found in the recent breast cancer study. On January 9, 1991 Jennings had no
 disclaimers for the secondhand smoke study: "A new warning today about the dangers of
 passive smoking, breathing someone else's cigarette smoke. A report in the American Heart
 Association journal Circulation says passive smoking kills an estimated 53,000 people every
 year."
<P>
<b>Civil Rights or Social Programs?</b>
<BR>
 Opening an October 20 New York Times story reporter Steven Holmes declared: "In his nearly
 four years in office, President Clinton has amassed a civil rights record rivaling that of
 any President in the last 30 years." His proof? Clinton "stoutly defended the government's
 affirmative action role." 
<P>
But the newspaper's style manual apparently contains a broad definition of the phrase "civil
rights." Holmes laid out what he considered to be Clinton's 1992 campaign promises
concerning civil rights: "Work to pass the Motor Voter bill" and "support statehood for the
District of Columbia." Plus two items with no relation to discrimination or voting: "Require
every employer to spend 1.5 percent of payroll for continuing education and training," and
"expand the Earned Income Tax Credit." Expanding the definition let Holmes give Clinton
credit for two "civil rights achievements" that passed, Motor Voter and the Earned Income
Tax Credit. 
<P>
<b>Depraved Clinton</b>
<BR>
 Newsweek Washington Bureau Chief Evan Thomas  had a change of heart on the credibility of
 Paula Jones. Prompted by former New York Times Supreme Court reporter Stuart Taylor's
 November article in The American Lawyer, on the November 3 Inside Washington, Thomas
 explained: "There are two friends of Paula Jones that she spoke to right after the alleged
 incident....Taylor has gone back and talked to them and they paint a pretty bad tale." Back
 on May 7, 1994 Thomas disparaged Jones as "some sleazy woman with big hair."
<P>
Taylor found that "the evidence supporting Paula Jones's allegations of predatory, if not
depraved, behavior by Bill Clinton is far stronger than the evidence supporting Anita Hill's
allegations of far less serious conduct by Clarence Thomas." In the three weeks after the
article appeared it didn't get a sentence in Newsweek or the other newsweeklies. Other than
a brief citation as an example of media bias by ABC's Jeff Greenfield on the October 31
World News Tonight, it drew not a second on the networks.
<p>
<b>Only One House?</b>
<br> 
Clinton has saved America's cities from the evil Reagan years, ABC News argued before the
election. Over video of a building being torn down, on the October 14 World News Tonight
ABC's Dean Reynolds asserted from Detroit: "Twenty five housing developments have started
here since the Clinton Administration took office." Following a soundbite from Detroit Mayor
Dennis Archer, Reynolds charged, without rebuttal, "A decade ago during the Reagan era,
according to the Mayor, only one new house was built in the entire city."

<h3>Bright Side, from the November 1996 Media Watch</h3>
<P>
<center><h2>Ross Stands Alone</h2></center>
<P>
<DD>With the revelations of questionable contributions to the Clinton campaign and the
Democratic Party, one would assume the media would be all over the story.  Not so. But ABC's
Brian Ross stood apart in October for focusing on Democratic fundraising. On the October 22
World News Tonight, Ross first put Jorge Cabrera, a twice convicted drug dealer who was
invited to the White House after giving $20,000 to the DNC, onto network TV: "As to how
Cabrera got inside the White House, the Democratic Party said today it did not know of his
criminal record and he had been referred to them as a prominent member of the Cuban-American
community in Monroe County, Florida. Tom Cash, the former top drug agent in Miami, says the
only thing prominent about Cabrera is his criminal record." Two days later Ross filed the
first broadcast network piece detailing John Huang's flight: "A federal judge ordered
Democratic Party lawyers into court and told them to produce John Huang to testify in a
civil lawsuit alleging favoritism at the Commerce Department for big Democratic
contributors." Ross showed how Huang could not be found and explained how he "was suspended
by the Democratic Party this week as a fundraiser when some of his contributions were found
to have been illegally given by people who were not U. S. citizens."
<P>
<center><h2>Ignored...Until Sunday</h2></center>
<P>
<DD>The network evening shows largely ignored Democratic financial scandal news, but two Sunday
shows picked up on them. On the October 13 Meet the Press host Tim Russert put VP Al Gore
off balance with his continual barrage of questions: "But isn't character a fair issue to
bring up? Why can't Republicans say, `Listen Bill Clinton promised, quote, the most ethical
administration in history, and it hasn't been that. Filegate, Travelgate, Whitewater.'" And,
"But what about the appearance, Mr. Vice President, of a gentleman, John Huang, working for
a Lippo Company, then joining the Commerce Department, where he works on their behalf,
lobbies on their behalf; then goes over to the DNC and raises money for them?" Russert even
noted "there's a perception the President is dangling pardons out there in order to silence
people." CNN's Frank Sesno pressed White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta on the October 27
Late Edition, questioning him about Ron Brown allegedly "selling seats" on his trade
missions. Sesno brought up how Huang "raises $4 to $5 milion from Asian-Americans, some of
it raised illegally. Money that came from South Korean business had to be returned. A
quarter of a million dollars, $400,000 from these Indonesian gardeners who since have gone
away....Where's the outrage from the White House?"

<h3>Page One from the November 1996 Media Watch</h3>
<p>
<center><h2>Whatever You Say, Mr. Clinton</h2></center>
<p>
<center><h2>Network Anchors Carry White House Spin that Voters Hate Investigations</h2></center>
<p>
<dd>Shortly after the election Clinton's aides told reporters that the voters wanted an end to
congressional investigations. They didn't have to convince reporters of anything. They
already agreed. NBC's Tom Brokaw noted on  election night: "There is also a theory, however,
that if the Republicans begin to engage once again in a lot of investigations that it will
not do well for them four years from now. Because the country in all the exit polling that
we're seeing so far is saying, `Hey let's get on with the business of solving the real
problems that we have out there.'"
<p>
<dd>Over on CBS, Dan Rather echoed Brokaw, asking Senator
Trent Lott: "True or false, that part of the Republican agenda is now to try to paralyze the
White House with so-called ethics inquiries?" The next morning, NBC Today substitute co-host
Matt Lauer asked RNC Chairman Haley Barbour: "Exit polls show us that the economy was still
the number one issue on people's mind last night. And although character and trust play a
role, people choose candidates based on their handling of the issues. With that in mind,
what do you say to people now who look to Republicans in Congress and say, `Hey, move
forward on key legislation. Don't get bogged down on investigations into the Clinton White
House?'"
<p>
<dd>When Sen. Al D'Amato announced he would back off his Whitewater probe in the
Senate, reporter Jim Miklaszewski concluded on the November 7 NBC Nightly News: "White House
officials are under no illusions and still expect Republicans to vigorously pursue
investigations on other fronts. But they're also encouraged that D'Amato's announcement may
signal an end to any high-profile political witch hunts." Tom Brokaw returned to his theme
on the November 7 Don Imus radio show, but added a new twist: it's in the Republican
leaders' self-interest to halt the investigations. He claimed "A lot of these new Republican
leaders, Trent Lott and others, have their own presidential aspirations four years from now.
They'll want to get things done because I think that's the underlying message from the
country here -- solve the problems. And yes there are some real problems within the
administration that need to be investigated, but there are agencies and ways of doing that
without tying up Congress in these expensive hearings." 
<p>
<dd>A post-election Pew Research Center
poll of voters determined that while thirty percent said Congress had "gone too far" in
investigating Clinton, the majority did not: 31 percent thought Congress had not gone far
enough and 35 percent indicated that "it has handled the matter about right." If only the
media were that evenly split.

<h3>Page Three from the November 1996 Media Watch</h3>
<p>
<center><h2>Networks Lay the Blame -- The GOP Shutdown?</h2></center>
<P>
<dd>The networks had a ready answer for why Bob Dole lost, suggesting it happened because the
public bought the Democratic spin that House Republicans were responsible for the government
shutdown. Of course, the media kept repeating that Democratic spin in its own reporting,
neglecting to mention that President Clinton refused to sign any budget resolution to keep
the government operating. It started before the election. On the October 18 World News
Tonight, ABC's Cokie Roberts relayed without challenge: "With the help of millions of
dollars from organized labor, Democratic challengers constantly remind voters that these
freshmen supported Newt Gingrich and that together they shut down the government."
<P>
 <dd>In a roundtable on the November 3 This Week with David Brinkley, ABC's Sam Donaldson asked
 fellow panel member George Will: "Are you going to shut down the government again? Did that
 strategy work?" (Donaldson repeated himself on election night, saying Dole's  loss wasn't
 his fault because Gingrich "helped engineer a shutdown" that "scared the country.") Looking
 back at the 1996 campaign on the November 4 This Morning, CBS's Bill Plante contemplated:
 "You think the campaign began here, at the Democrats' made for TV convention? No way. It
 really began with this year's State of the Union address. The President already knew he'd
 have no opponent in New Hampshire and the Republicans had just stumbled badly by shutting
 down the government."
<P>
<dd>The bias continued on election night. CNN's Bernard Shaw declared: "The Republican Party
actually helped William Jefferson Clinton in that comeback, especially when they voted to
shut down the Congress [sic]. The American people said they Republicans went too far. We did
not send you to Washington to shut down the federal government." On  the morning after the
election, CBS This Morning anchor Troy Roberts theorized: "Often abrasive, Gingrich never
mastered the fine art of compromise. Less than a year after he rode into Washington in
triumph, he was on the defensive. His gambit to shut down the government over the budget
backfired. Seizing the moment, President Clinton quickly became the voice of centrist
reason."

<center><h2>Media Highlight Brinkley -- But What About Them?</h2></center>
<p>
<dd>David Brinkley's election night comments that President Clinton is "a bore" and that his
acceptance speech delivered "goddamned nonsense" generated wide newspaper coverage. Brinkley
apologized to Clinton during a This Week interview, but other reporters have never
apologized or been condemned for comments about conservatives. NBC's Bryant Gumbel called
Pat Buchanan "Mr. Puke-anan" on the Feb. 20 Today. In 1994 he asked House Minority Leader
Dick Gephardt: "You called Gingrich and his ilk, your words, `trickle-down terrorists who
base their agenda on division, exclusion and fear.' Do you think middle-class Americans are
in need of protection from that group?" On David Letterman in 1987, Sam Donaldson advised
how to measure President Reagan's success in an upcoming press conference: "I think he is
going to have to pass two or three tests. The first is, will he get there, stand in front of
the podium, and not drool." Just after the 1994 election Donaldson asked Speaker-to-be Newt
Gingrich on This Week: "A lot of people are afraid of you. They think you're a bomb-thrower.
Worse, you're an intolerant bigot. Speak to them." On a January, 1995 Sunday Morning John
Leonard declared: "From the pronunciamentos out of Washington, you'd think the new Congress
were a slash-and-burn Khmer Rouge." NPR/ABC reporter Nina Totenberg issued a death wish on
Inside Washington in 1995 after Sen. Jesse Helms said too much is spent on AIDS research: "I
think he ought to be worried about what's going on in the Good Lord's mind, because if there
is retributive justice, he'll get AIDS from a transfusion, or one of his grandchildren will
get it."

<h3>In the Media from the November 1996 Media Watch</h3>
<p>
<center><h2>Slow Growth Hailed in '96</h2></center>
<p>
<center><h2>But Four Years Ago...</h2></center>
<p>
In late October 1992 the government announced the 3rd quarter GDP jumped up to 2.7 percent.
Four years later, on October 30, the 3rd quarter number fell to just 2.2 percent. But what
was bad news for Bush escaped such scorn this year with Bill Clinton in the Oval Office.
Indeed, NBC's Tom Brokaw positively spun this year's drop: "The economy was slow, but steady
going in the last quarter. Many economists were encouraged by that because it means
inflation is under control and interest rates will stay low."    On the CBS Evening News Ray
Brady noted: "There's one irony here. On election day 1992 the economy was starting to pick
up, but voters hadn't felt it yet. Remember that expression, `It's the economy stupid'? And
George Bush went down to defeat. On election day 1996 the economy seems to be slowing, but
not enough so that most voters will be feeling it." Why hadn't voters in 1992 "felt it"?
<P>
Maybe because Brady and his colleagues put a negative spin on 1992 economic news? On October
27, 1992, CBS reporter Susan Spencer filed from the Bush campaign: "He crowed today at
upbeat news of a third quarter growth rate of 2.7 percent, though some economists warned
that may not hold." She was correct, but not in the direction she thought. It was later
revised upward to 3.9 percent. On September 4, 1992 anchor Connie Chung led the show by
explaining: "The nation's unemployment rate is down slightly for the second month in a row.
But the latest decline is a result of a summer jobs program for teenagers. That program is
about to end, and as Ray Brady reports, the picture ahead is bleak." Brady concluded: "After
hitting a high of 7.8 percent for June, then dipping a tenth of a point again last month,
most economists now predict next month's jobless rate could hit 7.8 percent." 
<p>
One month
later, the rate fell from 7.6 to 7.5 percent. On the October 2, 1992 CBS Evening News Brady
skipped his mistake and offered a new reason to dismiss the good news: "Those unemployment
lines did become a bit shorter last month, but economists say that's largely because many
Americans simply stopped looking for work, so they're no longer counted as unemployed." CBS
wasn't the only culprit. On ABC's World News Tonight October 30 Peter Jennings gave equal
weight to both sides: "President Clinton...noted that many economists say a cooling off is
necessary to keep inflation down and therefore, he thinks, the numbers were good news.
Senator Dole on the other hand was in Tennessee earlier today, along with Mrs. Dole. He says
the numbers are cause for concern. He went on to say if Mr. Clinton is re-elected there
could be a recession." 
<p>
But four years ago Jennings insisted the 2.7 percent GDP is "more
than economists had projected, but in many cases, less than meets the eye." Bob Jamieson
then reported that "many economists say the report is not proof the economy is taking a
sharp turn for the better." The next day, October 28, 1992, Jennings warned: "The President
may complain about the news media, but the economic growth figures which he is so pleased
about are not that definitive, according to a great many independent economic analysts." All
this matches the Center for Media and Public Affairs finding that "In September, fully 91
percent of sources said the economy was healthy," but "in September 1992, 98 percent of all
sources on the [ABC, CBS and NBC] evening news criticized the state of the economy

<title>Study -- November 1996 Media Watch</title>
</head>
<body>
<h3>Study from the November 1996 Media Watch</h3>
<p>
<center><h2>A Continuing Pattern of Omission</h2></center>
<p>
<center><h2>Network Anchors Carry White House Spin that Voters Hate Investigations</h2></center>
<p>
<DD>Six days after the election, Washington Post media reporter Howard Kurtz noted that several
print media outlets had pieces of the Democratic National Committee's foreign fundraising in
hand, but didn't think they had enough for a major story -- until the pieces came together
in the person of John Huang in October. Just as MediaWatch found last month, front-page
newspaper scoops failed to attract much network interest or intensity, even in the final
days of the campaign. A MediaWatch review of October morning (ABC, CBS, NBC) and evening
news coverage (ABC, CBS, NBC and CNN's The World Today) found the networks were slow or
missing in action on critical campaign stories in the last few weeks before the election.
<P>
<DD>The networks aired only 26 explanatory or investigative pieces by non-campaign
correspondents (8 on CNN, 7 on ABC, 6 on CBS, and 5 on NBC). To review the developments:
<ul>
<li><i>October 8:</i> The Wall Street Journal front page introduced the story of John Huang and his resume: the Lippo Group, an Asian conglomerate with ties to Little Rock, followed by Ron Brown's Commerce Department, and then the Democratic National Committee, where he raised large amounts from Asian donors. Network coverage? None. 
<li><i>October 14:</i> Three days after Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) called for an independent counsel to investigate and one day after Newt Gingrich said the Indonesian story "makes Watergate look tiny," two networks arrived on the story. ABC's Jackie Judd led off World News Tonight with it, while on CBS, Eric Engberg had the newscast's number two story. The morning shows had small mentions in their Clinton stories. 
<li><i>October 17:</i> The Washington Post reported on the front page that the DNC acknowledged a "mistake" in holding an $140,000 fundraiser at a Buddhist temple in April organized by John Huang and attended by Vice President Gore. Neither that nor an October 25 Post front-page follow-up drew a network news story. Also on October 17, ABC's Brian Ross investigated Yogesh Gandhi, a $325,000 donor to the DNC, noting he owed the state of California $10,000 in back taxes. which raised the question if the $325,000 was really his money, or someone else's. No other network developed this story. (None of Ross's reports were replayed on Good Morning America.) 
<li><i>October 19:</i> The Washington Post reported on its front page that the DNC removed Huang from his money-raising duties and asked the Federal Election Commission to investigate the legality of Huang-solicited contributions. All four networks ran about a sentence-long update in the middle of their campaign coverage -- CBS on the 18th, the rest on the 19th. NBC's Today read two briefs on Huang's suspension. That same day, the Democrats returned a $20,000 contribution from convicted Miami cocaine smuggler Jorge Cabrera, admitting they do not systematically check the background of donors None of the networks reported the story that night. ABC's Brian Ross did a full report on October 22, noting that while Cabrera was convicted of possessing more than 5,000 pounds of cocaine in July, the DNC did not give the money back until Newsweek began asking about it. CNN and NBC followed on the 24th. CBS did not. In the morning, Cabrera drew only two brief mentions on NBC's Today. 
<li><i>October 23:</i>  Expanding on Brian Ross, the Los Angeles Times reported that Yogesh Gandhi, the $325,000 donor to the DNC, claimed pauper status in not paying the $20 filing fee for his divorce. Network coverage? None. Federal judge Royce Lamberth issued an order for the DNC to produce Huang. Only NBC Nightly News reported the subpoena. October 24: Lamberth issued another order demanding the DNC produce Huang. Only ABC's World News Tonight reported on the story. After Brian Ross focused on the effort to locate Huang, Asia-based reporter Mark Litke reported on the Clintons' ties to the Riady family, the Indonesians who run the Lippo Group. The morning shows were absent. 
<li><i>October 25:</i> A panel of federal judges asked independent counsel Kenneth Starr to investigate whether former White House  counsel Bernard Nussbaum lied about Hillary Clinton's role in the hiring of Craig Livingstone. Two days later, NBC's Tim Russert insisted on the Sunday Today: "This is dead serious....I don't know how we can dismiss it nine days before an election." But only CNN's Bob Franken filed a full report. ABC and NBC had their anchors read briefs. CBS aired nothing. Other than one anchor brief on Saturday's Today, the morning shows reported nothing. 
<li><i>October 29:</i> The Washington Post published a front-page story reporting the DNC would not file a pre-election contributions report with the Federal Elections Commission, and John Huang surfaced after 11 days in hiding to testify. All four networks arrived on the story that evening. (While ABC's and NBC's morning shows reported the DNC's failure to file in anchor briefs, CBS This Morning aired nothing until the next day.) 
<li><i>October 30:</i> The Los Angeles Times reported that Mark Middleton, "a little-known, 34-year-old ex-White House aide from Arkansas," arranged a meeting between President Clinton and the chief financial manager of Taiwan's ruling party. The Times reported that the official, Liu Tai-Ying, offered to donate (illegally) $15 million to the Clinton campaign. Only CNN and NBC reported the story that night. ABC didn't even report a full campaign story. CBS followed the next day. NBC's Today, with a full report by Andrea Mitchell, was the only morning show on the story. 
<li><i>October 31:</i> "DNC Fundraiser Huang Visited White House Often," reported the front page of The Washington Post, 78 times since July 1995. ABC and CBS reported the story, but NBC did not. ABC's Good Morning America covered the story, but CBS This Morning and NBC's Today did not. ABC's Charles Gibson suggested "if Republicans had done this, the press would be killing them."
<li><i>November 3:</i> The Associated Press reported former Clinton CIA Director R. James Woolsey criticized Democrats for inviting foreign businessman Grigori Loutchansky to a 1994 DNC dinner, where he was photographed with the President. Clinton's own CIA Director, John Deutch, had testified that Loutchansky's company, Nordex, is "associated with Russian criminal activity." Network coverage: None. 
<li><i>November 4:</i> The Detroit Free Press reported on an October 21 Detroit fundraiser that netted $800,000 from  Iraqi Christians who lobbied the President to lift the embargo against Iraq. CBS and NBC threw in brief evening news mentions. ABC and CNN did not. The morning shows were silent.

<title>Janet Cooke Award -- November 1996 Media Watch</title>
</head>
<body>
<h3>Janet Cooke Award from the November 1996 Media Watch</h3>
<p>
<center><h2>Frontline Devotes An Hour to the Press, But Ignores Conservatives -- and Liberal Bias</h2></center>
<p>
<center><h2>Money is the Root of All Media Evils</h2></center>
<p>
<dd>Earlier this year, journalists bashing journalists became a fad. Atlantic Monthly editor
James Fallows' new book Breaking the News: How the Media Undermine Democracy led a new,
liberal attack on the media: too stardom-obsessed, too enamored of power, too wealthy from
lecture fees, too distant from the common people -- even too conservative on economics. On
October 22, Frontline aired a documentary titled "Why Americans Hate the Press," a
co-production with the far-left Center for Investigative Reporting. Correspondent and
producer Stephen Talbot never really attempted to answer how people feel about the press in
the hour-long program. Instead, he centered his program around Fallows arguing for the
"sedate high church" of journalism, as opposed to the reporters who've lost touch while
cashing in on Sunday morning "food fight" fame. 
<P>
 <dd>This thesis originated from Fallows -- and Bill Clinton. As Bob Woodward explained on
 Frontline: "Clinton makes that point in my book, that he believes that the Washington press
 corps is so out of touch that it is absolutely inconceivable that reporters will understand
 the issues that people are really dealing with in their lives, and Clinton feels a profound
 alienation from the Washington culture here, and I happen to agree with him." 
<P>
<dd>For probing the press from the left without balancing the show with press criticism from the
right, Frontline earned the Janet Cooke Award. Among the questions raised by a viewing of
the program: 
<ol>
<li><i>Where were the conservatives?</i> One thing that makes many Americans, and tens of millions of conservatives, hate the press is its liberal bias, but it went absolutely unmentioned. Questions about bias surfaced in Talbot's interviews with several of the talking heads (presented in full on the PBS website), but they never made the show. With the exception of Fred Barnes (who didn't comment on bias), not a single conservative appeared. Instead, PBS presented a left-wing stable of media scolds. First and foremost came Fallows, echoed by Washington Post reporter/columnist David Broder and media reporter Howard Kurtz, and even far-left critics Christopher Hitchens and Mark Hertsgaard, whose book On Bended Knee: The Press and the Reagan Presidency argued the press was incredibly soft on Ronald Reagan. Curiously, instead of investigating the press in its daily work on print and television, Talbot began the show with Fallows attacking The McLaughlin Group, a PBS program, and its commercial imitators, even interspersing them with footage of professional wrestling. Said Fallows: "That is something I would like to see done away with." Broder argued: "What bothers me is the notion that journalists believe, or some journalists believe, that they can have their cake and eat it, too, that you can have all of the special privileges, access, and extraordinary freedom that you have because you are a journalist in a society that protects journalism to a greater degree than any other country in the world, and at the same time, you can be a policy advocate, you can be a public performer on the lecture circuit or on television. I think that's greedy." Kurtz added: "It's certainly true that the more journalists have  become part of the affluent upper middle class, they have started to identify more with the elite in our society rather than the people who plunk down their quarters at the news stands for newspapers. I think that's a real problem." 
<li><i>Where was the evidence?</i> Talbot decried the influences on reporters who make large sums in speaking fees from corporations, but never provided a single example of content altered by them. As Fred Barnes suggested, "I haven't ever had anybody point out to me where that's happened." PBS didn't either. Fallows complained that corporations and trade associations expect a "subtle immunization," that before "doing you in," a reporter will say: "Oh, gee, I know old Joe from the tobacco lobby, maybe I should call him, see what he has to say." But isn't it the job of any decent reporter to include the business side of a dispute? 
<li><i>What about nonprofit groups?</i> Talbot touted ABC's July 1994 decision to ban reporter speaking conflicts:  "To avoid these potential and embarrassing conflicts of interest, ABC imposed a new policy banning speeches to lobbying groups by its reporters." But the rule doesn't apply to nonprofit advocacy groups. For example, in May 1994, ABC's Carole Simpson hosted a fundraiser for the liberal NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund. Why is it a conflict of interest to speak to the tobacco lobby but not to raise money for liberal lobbies like the NAACP? ABC told us its policy covered "groups with a political purpose," which they felt didn't include the NAACP. PBS didn't bring this up. 
<li><i>What does the revolving door prove?</i> Talbot decried the revolving door between journalism and politics, focusing on famous revolvers like Tim Russert and David Gergen. But he failed to mention what the revolving  door proves. For years, MediaWatch has documented how almost four times as many liberals and Democrats have revolved into the media as have conservatives or Republicans, which should have raised a question about whether liberal bias results. 
<li><i>Isn't this hypocrisy?</i> Except for Woodward, who Talbot interviewed and then counted on Hertsgaard to bash as an insider, Talbot never challenged his stable of liberal critics. Fallows insisted he despises buckraking revolving-door journalism, but keeps David Gergen at U.S. News. Broder deplored reporters as "policy advocates," but for many years has been a reporter and a columnist. Kurtz proclaimed reporters sympathize with politicians rather than the public, yet Kurtz has regularly complained about Bill Clinton's supposed maltreatment at the hands of reporters, talk show hosts, and comedians. When MediaWatch called the Center for Investigative Reporting in San Francisco for comment, Talbot was in Italy. CIR executive Sharon Tiller, listed as a producer on the Frontline program, did not return phone calls. Perhaps the most interesting sub-theme of the show is how a PBS program could point out media buckrakers like Cokie Roberts (of NPR), Steve Roberts (a PBS Washington Week in Review regular), and David Gergen (of The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer), but didn't suggest that PBS is a breeding ground for buckraking -- that the network spawned out of a contempt for commercialism is now awash in profiteering opportunities for those who are chosen to grace its airwaves. The worse hypocrisy of all belongs to Frontline itself. It deplored reporters being too close to power, but after years of leveling discredited allegations at the Reagan and Bush administrations, it hasn't done a single investigative program on the Clintons in four years.

<title>NEGATIVE CAMPAIGNING: LOOK WHO'S TALKING</title>
</head>

<Body color="#FFFFFF">

<center>
<h2>NEGATIVE CAMPAIGNING: LOOK WHO'S TALKING</h2>
<h3>By L. Brent Bozell III</h3>
</center>
<p>
<dd>The pundits are right. This is the worst year of negative campaigning I've ever seen. These Republican candidates are being torn apart at the seams. Just sample some of the invective that's being thrown at them on television:
<ol>
<li>Before the campaign really got going, Phil Gramm's campaign was being smeared with a negative TV ad featuring on the screen a New Republic headline labeling Gramm "The Porn Broker" for 18 seconds. When the New Republic's source for the allegation that Gramm had funded a "soft-porn" film in the 1970s repudiated the story, saying "there was no pornography at all," there were no apologies.
<li>Steve Forbes saw his flat tax plan attacked in one campaign commercial as likely to produce "hideous deficits." The ad concluded: "The fact remains the flat tax is a giant, untested theory. One economist suggested before we put it in, we should test it out someplace -- like Albania." 
<li>The most vicious negative attacks have been aired against Pat Buchanan. One underlined his endorsement by Russian nationalist kook Vladimir Zhirinovsky. Another one charged: "It's not that Pat Buchanan today is associated with overtly anti-Semitic or racist acts or statements, but rather that he has  created an image of someone who might be sympathetic to such acts or statements by others." Yet another stooped to attacks on his family, charging his father listened to the anti-Semitic radio show of Father Coughlin, and that his little brothers beat up Jewish kids -- "Christ-killers," they were allegedly called -- in the 1950s.
</ol>
<dd>Yet another ad against Buchanan showed racist nut David Duke at a Buchanan rally, and featured an endorsement from Ku Klux Klansman Daniel Carver. The ad concluded: "A man who says what he means and means what he says and now must fight the embrace of people who think they know exactly what he's talking about."
<p>
<dd>As you may already have concluded, these aren't really commercials made by the Republican presidential candidates. Anyone who watches politics knows that were candidates to say these things in their commercials they would be universally scorned -- especially by the press -- for doing so. They are, instead, what the networks themselves have offered us in this campaign. ABC smeared Phil Gramm. CBS bombed the Forbes flat tax. ABC's Ted Koppel and CBS's Bob McNamara hurled bigoted attacks at Buchanan. If we would hound candidates off the hustings for these kinds of attacks, why do we tolerate them from reporters?
<p>
<dd>These are the same networks who shake their heads and decry the corrosive negativity of politics. After the recent South Carolina debate, in which the candidates were required to respond to each other's negative ads, the networks all clucked at how unappetizing the prospect was. One wonders if they have considered how unappetizing watching their own programs can be. If they still wish to be the black pot lecturing the kettles on negative campaigning throughout this election year, I have four words for them: Sit down. Shut up. 
<p>
<dd>Koppel, for his part, couldn't even leave his attacks at the low level of questioning the ancient antics of the Buchanan children. (This, from the man who said of Bill Clinton's draft-dodging thank-you letter: "if we were electing that 23-year-old man, what he said and thought and felt at that time would be germane.") Koppel had help from Time essayist Lance Morrow, who in his magazine likened Buchanan to Joe McCarthy -- "the driving, urgent undershadow of menace." For "Nightline," Morrow added that Buchanan's upbringing at the Blessed Sacrament Church and Gonzaga High School was marked by a "reflexive" anti-Semitism of the "they killed Christ" variety. But others who attended high school with Buchanan flatly deny this outrageous charge. You guessed it: "Nightline" ignored them. 
<p>
<dd>Liberal Boston Globe columnist Tom Oliphant has called the liberal media to account on these charges of bigotry against Buchanan, often employing guilt by association: "For liberals to be silent simply because this filth is being directed at a creature of the Right who happens to be on a political roll is intolerable." 
<p>
<dd>Already, the media are preparing this story line for the 1996 general election campaign. Bill Clinton, the Great Triangulator, is trying to give the country a better tomorrow, while the Republicans, devoid of vision, have nothing to offer but cheap negative attacks.  
<p>
<dd>It's important to declare that negativity has a place in any campaign in defining why one candidate deserves to be elected over his opponent. But let the candidates do that. Decency is also important. It's time the national media attempt to rise to the level of civility these Republican candidates have shown each other.

</center>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
Americans are unquestionably a religious people. Studies show that virtually
all of us believe in God or another higher spiritual force; a clear majority regularly
attend religious services.<p>
     
Both news and entertainment television insist they reflect reality, yet they continue 
to tell the public that religion is insignificant and, more likely than not, a negative 
influence in society. <P>

Such is the primary finding of the Media Research Center's third annual study on 
the major television  networks' treatment of religion, which covers all network news
and prime time entertainment programming.  Faith in a Box, the most comprehensive
analysis of television and religion ever done, consists of two separate studies, one
on the news, the other on entertainment television.<p> 
<hr>

<a name="Entertainment"</a>
<center><B>Entertainment Media:<p></center></b>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
<UL>
<LI>The number of portrayals of religion in prime time went up slightly, to 287 from 
253 in 1994. However,  given that there were almost 1,800 hours of original shows,
that means there was only fewer than one depiction for every six hours of programming
 -- a slightly better ratio than that of 1994. Most of the increase in portrayals is attributable
to the debut last year of two part-time networks, UPN and WB. CBS's treatments of religion
greatly increased, but this was offset by ABC's sharp drop off.<p>

<LI>In two categories -- depictions of the devout laity and of the clergy -- the situation
worsened markedly. In the laity category, positives plummeted from 44 percent in '94
to 11 percent in '95, while negatives shot  from 35 percent in '94 to 64 percent last year.
Only 20 percent of depictions of the clergy were positive in '95, an eight percent drop
from '94.<p>

<LI>On no network were even half the overall portrayals positive. CBS had the highest
percentage (47.5) of  positive depictions among the major networks. ABC (36.7) and
NBC (34.4) were well in back of CBS, while Fox (24.4) badly trailed all other networks.<p>
</ul>
<hr>

<a name="News"</a>
<center><b>News Media:</b></center><p>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
<UL>
<LI>Total network news coverage of religion in 1995 remained numerically insignificant:
out of more than 18,000 evening news stories in 1995, religion drew only 249; out of
more than 26,000 morning news segments, religion drew only 224. For three years in
a row, the news networks have had trouble cracking a one-percent barrier when it 
comes to religion coverage.<p>

           
<LI>The Catholic Church dominated religion news coverage, attracting almost 50 percent
of the evening stories and 71 percent of the morning segments. CBS aired the most 
obviously negative stories on the Catholic Church, including a 60 Minutes profile with
25 &quot;dissidents&quot; and no defenders, and a story calling Ireland a &quot;
church-dominated backwater.&quot;<p>

<LI>While the total number of stories about violence and harassment at abortion clinics
declined from 245 stories in 1994 to 142, only three stories focused on the documented
violence of abortionor harassment by abortion advocates.<p>

<LI>The religious right was again portrayed as extreme and damaging to the Republican Party,
even though not a single pro-life incumbent lost in the 1994 elections.  <p>
</ul>
In the first two studies, the MRC suggested a number of ways the networks could improve
their coverageof religion. With a few notable exceptions, none has been enacted. Given the
public's increasing dissatisfaction with and distrust of the media, it is instructive to repeat
these recommendations and urge network decision makers to change their course.<p> 

Network entertainment divisions should cease their hostility to persons of faith and 
respect religious values. Furthermore, they should attempt to match CBS's success 
with Touched By an Angel by airing other pro-faith series of their own. Also, they 
ought to recognize that the audience for such religion-friendly programming is not
only large, but affluent (i.e., it's an attractive demographic for advertisers).<p>

The news study recommends that the networks decisively break the one-percent
ghetto of coverage that religion receives every year. To make that recommendation
reality, the networks need to make a serious commitment to hire a religion correspondent.
With the exception of ABC, the networks have failed to go beyond general assignment 
reporters. The news study also recommends that network reporters try harder to present
religious issues and authorities in a fair-minded and objective manner, especially on social
issues. <p>

  <p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
The Media Research Center's initial &quot;Faith in a Box&quot; study
explored how entertainment television handled religion in 1993.
The report showed that on the rare occasions when sitcoms,
dramas, miniseries, and made-for-TV movies treated spiritual
topics, it was most often in a hostile manner; there were even
some cases of bluntly anti-religious bigotry. <p>

The mixed results documented in our second study, which dealt
with 1994 programming, suggested that a rethinking and
reawakening might have been taking place in Hollywood. Whereas in
1993 negative depictions had outnumbered positive ones by a
3-to-2 ratio, in '94 there were almost twice as many positive as
negative portrayals. Furthermore, the total number of religious
incidences more than doubled: there were 253 in '94, versus only
116 in '93. <p>

The minuses: the laity and the clergy continued to be vilified in
dramas, ridiculed in comedies. Moreover, the frequency of
religious depictions -- roughly, one for every seven hours of
programming -- illuminated the fact that religion remained
largely a non-presence in prime time. <p>
 
This third annual study, covering 1995 programming, indicates in
one sense that the '94 results were not aberrant: overall, there
again were more positive than negative portrayals. However, in
two categories -- depictions of the devout laity and of the
clergy -- the picture worsened markedly. And, not only did the
total number of treatments increase only slightly, most of the
jump was attributable to the 1995 launch of two part-time
networks, UPN and WB.<p>

Television bigwigs like to claim their fare reflects reality.
This is clearly not the case with religion; given its prevalence
and popularity in our society, it is 1) seriously
underrepresented and 2) ill-served on prime time. The viewing
public is waiting for the networks to close, or at least narrow,
this gap. <p>

Our methodology: MRC analysts studied virtually all 1995 prime
time entertainment programs on the broadcast networks ABC, CBS,
Fox, NBC, UPN, and WB. Instances of religious content were
entered into a computerized data base and categorized under
either personal faith; religion in doctrinal and institutional
terms; the laity; the clergy; or miscellaneous. <p>

Within each category, the instances were classified as either
positive, mixed, neutral, or negative. &quot;Mixed&quot; indicates balanced
points of view with ultimately no side taken; the &quot;neutral&quot;
designation encompasses depictions that were ambiguous or offered
insufficiently substantial treatments of the issue. (In our
previous studies, mixed/neutral was one category.)<p>


The outstanding portrayals in each category are presented below
in order of their length, with the briefest instances discussed
first. Not all treatments or mentions of religion are touched on
in the text, but each is represented in the statistical
appendices, and each is noted by category, chronologically, in a
third appendix.<p>

<h3>II. STUDY RESULTS</h3>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
<i>Overview?</i><p>

In 1995, there were 1,798 hours of original prime time
entertainment programming on the six broadcast networks. Those
webs aired 287 portrayals of religion; 38.3 percent of these were
positive, 27.9 negative, 7.3 mixed, and 26.5 neutral. <p>

Where raw numbers are concerned, CBS led with 99 depictions; NBC
broadcast 93, Fox 45, ABC 30. (UPN, with 12, and WB, with eight,
both of which went on the air early in 1995, each offered
programming only two nights per week that year.) NBC
and Fox held relatively steady from last year to this, but CBS's
number represented an large increase over 1994's total of 63,
while ABC plummeted from its 1994 figure of 67.  <p>

CBS had the highest percentage of positive depictions, at 47.5;
ABC (36.7 percent) and NBC (34.4) followed, and Fox, with 24.4,
brought up the rear among the major networks. Fox led in negative
portrayals at 46.7 percent; ABC (36.7), NBC (26.9), and CBS
(20.2) trailed. <p>

In religious terms, Touched By an Angel, the CBS drama currently
in its second season, was the outstanding series of 1995, and
perhaps the most pro-faith series in television history. (After a
shaky start, it is also a bona fide popular success.) No series
was anywhere near as anti-religious, although Fox's The Simpsons
consistently got in its licks. Probably the greatest
disappointment of the year was NBC's Amazing Grace, whose
minister protagonist espoused a faith so diluted as to be almost
unrecognizable.<p>
<pre>
   <h3>A. Faith: Prime Time's Expressions of Belief<p></h3>

  As in 1993 and '94, religion was treated far more favorably in
  this category than in any other. It comprises instances wherein a
  person states or manifests in simple terms his or her belief, or
  lack thereof.

  Positive -- 76.6 percent (74% in 1994; 63% in 1993)<p>

  On prime time, the most common indication of faith is prayer. In
  the March 13 NBC movie Awake to Danger, a father whose daughter
  is in a coma offers to help; the doctor tells him to pray. On the
  February 21 Grace Under Fire (ABC), a man remarks that he &quot;prayed
  that the Lord would give me one more chance to make [his
  seriously ill father] proud of me.&quot;<p>


  A character on the September 25 Chicago Hope (CBS) says, &quot;I
  hadn't been to church in years. That is, not until recently, when
  my daughter had heart trouble and I found myself praying.&quot;
  Another medical drama, NBC's ER, featured on its December
  14 episode an elderly Holocaust survivor whose kidnapped
  granddaughter had just been found alive. The old woman comments
  that while the little girl was missing, &quot;I did something that I
  stopped doing fifty years ago: I prayed.&quot;<p>
   
  On the September 30 Sisters (NBC), Teddy, who is coming out of a
  coma, takes part in a fantastical exchange with her younger self.
  After the young Teddy says, &quot;All it takes is a little
  persistence,&quot; the adult Teddy adds, &quot;;And a whole lot of faith.&quot;
  The camera then pans upward to the sky. <P>
   
  One of the celestial emissaries on CBS's Touched By an Angel had
  her own crisis of faith in the February 25 episode. Monica,
  addressing God, wonders, &quot;Why have You forsaken me? Why are You
  punishing me?&quot; Monica's mentor, Tess, responds, &quot;Has God ever
  forsaken you, Monica? He told you he wouldn't, and He never has.&quot;<p>
   
  Fox's The X-Files surprised many with an affirmation of
  Catholicism in its December 15 installment. Scully, an FBI agent,
  regains her faith while investigating a series of murders in
  which each victim has what appears to be stigmata. After the case
  is solved, Scully goes to confession and discusses her drift from
  the Church in the past few years; the priest tells her,
  &quot;Sometimes you have to go full circle.&quot; Scully has the
  show's last line: &quot;God is speaking, but no one's listening.&quot;<p>

  The January 10 episode of NBC's The John Larroquette Show
  centered on what many perceived as an image of Jesus Christ on a
  bus-station wall. Even though it transpires that the face is
  really that of Willie Nelson from an old, painted-over poster,
  the image inspires a good deal of pro-faith reflection. The bus
  station manager, addressing God, states, &quot;I have spent most of my
  life unconvinced of Your existence, [but] I have come to believe
  in a higher power.&quot;<p>


  Negative -- 6.4 percent (6% in 1994; 22% in 1993)<p>

  On the May 9 NYPD Blue (ABC), Detective Sipowicz explains to his
  fiancee that he lost his faith as a result of the depravity he's
  witnessed on the job, and on the December 1 Homicide: Life on the
  Street (NBC), a Baltimore detective, offered the chance to see
  the Pope in person during the pontiff's visit to that city,
  comments, &quot;Sixty thousand people...looking at a man for some sort
  of miracle? No, thank you. I'm not interested.&quot;<p>

  Mixed --  8.5 percent; Neutral -- 8.5 percent; (Mixed/neutral 20%
  in 1994; 15% in 1993)<p>

  One mixed incidence was found on the February 26 Earth 2 (NBC).
  After Yale prays, Mary, a resident of the Tarian planet, asks,
  &quot;Who were you talking to?&quot; Yale responds, &quot;God...[to] ask
  forgiveness for the harm that [one does].&quot; Mary counters,
  &quot;The Tarian way is better: Don't harm.&quot; A neutral example:
  apropos of a murder, a policeman on the March 19 NBC movie Ed
  McBain's 87th Precinct asks, &quot;If there's a God in heaven, why do
  things like this have to happen?&quot; His partner answers, &quot;I don't
  know.&quot;<p> 


   <h3>B. The Institution: Prime Time's Treatment of Churches and Their
     Doctrines</h3>

  This category deals with religion handled in institutional terms,
  such as a reference to a service or to a particular church or its
  doctrines.

  Positive -- 31.1 percent (46% in 1994; 50% in 1993)
  On the January 17 Something Wilder (NBC), a boy, age five or so,
  asks his father where one goes after death. His father replies,
  &quot;Heaven.&quot; A character on the November 26 episode of Fox's Space:
  Above and Beyond comments, "When I'm on a battlefield, and I see
  a human dead...I can feel something is missing...You can feel
  they have no souls." 
 
  During the December 12 CBS movie A Holiday to Remember, a woman
  tells a young runaway, "Come on, I don't want to be visiting you
  down at the jail in five years. You need religion." On the
  December 18 Can't Hurry Love (CBS), Annie tries to organize her
  co-workers to volunteer with religious charities, performing such
  tasks as collecting Christmas gifts for needy children.<p>
 
  Negative -- 31.1 percent (22% in 1994; 50% in 1993)<p>

  The title character of CBS's Murphy Brown is hosting a memorial
  service in the January 16 installment; asked if she's put a Bible
  out for the mourners, Murphy answers, &quot;Eeeuuuwww, I don't think I
  have one.&quot; On the November 2 episode of Fox's The Crew, a woman
  says to a gay character, &quot;I don't care what they say about you in
  Leviticus. I think you are fun.&quot;<p>
   
  In the March 8 premiere of CBS's The George Wendt Show, two
  characters return to their old church for casino night; one says
  the visit brings back memories of "the gradual stripping away of
  a young boy's self-esteem.&quot; On the November 21 episode of ABC's
  Roseanne, the protagonist, playing an unpleasant pilgrim at the
  first Thanksgiving, dismisses an Indian's reference to "Mother
  Earth.&quot;<p>

  &quot;That's nothing but heathen talk,&quot; Roseanne remarks. "There is
  one God. He's in  heaven, sitting on [His] throne, so he can damn
  everything. The end.&quot;<p>
  
  
  Mixed -- 6.6 percent; Neutral -- 31.1 percent; (Mixed/neutral 32%
  in 1994; 0% in 1993)
   
  A mixed example comes from the May 9 Wings (NBC). After a
  character remarks that he's going to attend Mass regularly, a
  friend commends him: "Good for you...Without a strong spiritual
  connection, what does life really mean?" He asks what religion
  she is, to which she replies dismissively, "I don't know. Some
  sort of Protestant."
  
  In the neutral category, a character on the June 14 High Sierra
  Search and Rescue (NBC) who's been a recluse since her husband
  left her is rebuked by a friend: "You quit your job because you
  couldn't make it ten miles to work. Then five miles to church."
  On the March 14 John Larroquette Show, a regular character rigs
  it so John can see another player's poker hand. Afterwards, the
  character says, "What if God really does keep score of all the
  bad things you do? I'd hate to think I had only one sin left and
  wasted it riggin' a poker game when I could've robbed a bank or
  something."  


   <h3>C. The Laity: Prime Time's Portrayal of Believers</h3>

  This category encompasses depictions of those for whom religion
  is a strong (sometimes the central) force in their lives. It
  covers both portrayals of their explicitly religious words or
  deeds and their secular conduct. As opposed to simple
  declarations of faith, we see here and in the clergy category
  that the more elaborate the depiction, the more likely it is to
  be negative -- a finding common to all three studies.   


  Positive -- 11.1 percent (44% in 1994; 18% in 1993)
   
  In the March 20 NBC movie Menu For Murder, a mistress asserts her
  affair with a judge would not have lasted because the judge's
  wife is a devout Catholic. On the October 31 The Client (CBS), a
  woman tells a friend that the friend's taking in her grandchild
  was &quot;a Christian thing.&quot;<p>
  
  Negative -- 64.4 percent (35% in 1994; 68% in 1993)
   
  Murphy Brown's title character, addressing a women's studies
  class during the October 30 episode, asserts, "While we sit here
  arguing, the radical religious right is working to take away
  everything we've fought for." During the May 14 CBS movie
  The Rockford Files: A Blessing in Disguise, an actress appearing
  in an irreverent movie is called a "slut" and almost physically
  assaulted by followers of a televangelist.  
   
  Detectives on the February 24 Homicide: Life on the Street drop
  by the house of a middle-aged woman prominently displaying a
  crucifix on her front door. She admits she killed her boyfriend
  (for dating her sister) and put his body in the freezer. On the
  November 29 Law & Order, a mentally disturbed woman kills her
  baby daughter because she believes God wanted her to.
  
  Mixed -- 4.4 percent; Neutral -- 20.0 percent; (Mixed/neutral 21%
  in 1994; 14% in 1993)
   
  One of the mixed treatments was offered by the April 28 Picket
  Fences (CBS). After killing a swan, a repentant young boy becomes
  devoutly religious and develops what appear to be stigmata. His
  sister accepts what happens to him at face value, but the
  patriarch says any supernatural explanation is "crap" and
  "evidence of how dangerous and how ridiculous organized religion
  can be."
   
  Neutral examples: on the January 10 Frasier (NBC), an adult son
  says to his father, "Brush your teeth and say your prayers." The
  father responds, "That's what I used to say...didn't I?" His
  other son says, "No, you didn't," to which the father replies, "I
  meant to." Establishing his credentials as a good citizen, a
  murder suspect on the November 22 Law & Order (NBC) says, "I pay
  my taxes. I go to church." He turns out to be innocent. 
  

   <h3>D. The Clergy: Prime Time's Treatment of Religious Leaders</h3>
   
  This category comprises portrayals of the professionally
  religious.
  
  Positive -- 20.0 percent (28% in 1994; 15% in 1993)
   
  On the November 27 Nowhere Man (UPN), a mother gives her son news
  of his hometown: Father Kearney has died. "He was a wonderful
  man," she says. "Everyone in town will miss him dearly." In the
  February 5 CBS movie The Piano Lesson, a minister says, "I ain't
  got no power...God's got the power...God's got a wonderful
  power." A priest on the November 12 NBC movie Her Hidden Truth
  champions the cause of a woman unjustly convicted of murder.
  
  Negative -- 41.7 percent (31% in 1994; 59% in 1993)
   
  On the January 1 George Carlin Show (Fox), a waitress in a bar
  shows her breasts to a priest. He says he finds them attractive,
  whereupon she says to her boyfriend, "If an abnormal man like him
  likes them, they're good enough for you." On the March 25
  Mommies (NBC), a woman laments, "I've turned into a boring person
  who makes rules and says no," to which her friend queries,
  "You're the Pope?" A married minister asks Ellen for a date on
  the November 5 Cleghorne! (WB).
   
  During the March 8 George Wendt Show, a man reminisces about a
  nun lifting him by his eyebrows and about "all the hell [priests
  and nuns] put me through as a kid." In the April 17 NBC movie The
  Other Mother, a teen mother lives at a Catholic halfway house;
  the nuns who run the home are portrayed not just as well-meaning
  disciplinarians, but as excessively harsh. 
 

  Mixed -- 5.0 percent, Neutral -- 33.3 percent (Mixed/neutral 41%
  in 1994; 26% in 1993)<p>
 
  The December 8 Picket Fences provided the outstanding mixed
  instance. The episode centered on a visit by Pope John Paul II to
  a small Wisconsin town, where he witnesses a murder. The attorney
  for the accused killer declares that because the victim was gay,
  the Pope can't be an unbiased witness given the Vatican's
  condemnation of homosexual acts. Others, including the judge in
  the case, are more respectful of the pontiff.<p>
   
  Among the neutrals: On the October 1 Hope & Gloria (NBC),
  regarding a nun named Theodore Rose, a man wonders, &quot;Why do nuns
  always have names that make them sound like they're half man,
  half woman?&quot; His ex-wife answers, &quot;What difference does it make?
  They don't use either half.&quot; On the October 8 Can't Hurry Love, a
  woman says, &quot;I'm sure even Mother Teresa has things she doesn't
  like about guys. OK, so maybe her dating years are behind her,
  but you get my point.&quot; <p>
  

   <h3>E. Miscellaneous</h3>

  In other words, everything that didn't fit into the other
  categories. Many references to God go here if they don't belong
  under Faith, inasmuch as He is not, strictly speaking, clergy.<p>
   
  As usual, almost all incidences were mixed or neutral. On the
  September 17 Cybill (CBS), a woman who's just been on a shopping
  spree says, &quot;I, for one, feel closer to God.&quot; One of the positive
  examples was heard on the May 5 Homicide: Life on the Street.
  When a detective was told he was lucky not to have been shot, he
  replies, &quot;Luck had nothing to do with it. God reached down and
  graced [the potential killer] with wisdom.&quot; 
</Pre>

<h3>III. RECOMMENDATIONS</center></h3> <br>
  <p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p> 
In last year's study, we noted a marginal improvement in prime
time's treatment of religion from 1993 to `94, yet in
quantitative terms the numbers were still anemic and in
qualitative terms the attacks on religion continued.<P>
  
Regarding 1995, the overall numbers were similar to those of `94.
There was, however, significant qualitative regression in certain
categories. <p>
   
Perhaps this was, in part, liberal Hollywood's reaction to the
widely acknowledged boost that evangelical voters gave
conservative Republican candidates in the fall '94 elections.
Perhaps old habits don't change easily.<p> 
   
Whatever the motivation, the step backward is cause for concern.
The silver lining, though, is that the failure of the broadcast
networks' yuppie-centered fall offerings and the continued
decline in their share of the audience makes a return to
traditional programming a more attractive prospect now. Our
recommendations:<p>
     
Re-establish respect for religious values on the networks.
Religion should not be treated as if it were a political issue,
where a balance of positive and negative is considered
appropriate. Rather, faith in general, and the faithful in
particular, should be afforded the dignity it and they deserve.
It is highly unlikely that any major network will ever air vast
amounts of faith-oriented programming, nor do we suggest such a
thing should be done. The networks can, however, make it clear to
religious viewers that at the very least, their shows will not
assault Judeo-Christian values. <p>

Clone a religious hit. After the young-adult-oriented Friends
became a smash in the 1994-'95 season, the fall '95 prime time
schedule was thick with series in that genre. With the success of
Touched By an Angel, the networks now have a pro-faith winner to
copy. Wouldn't it be nice to see more shows that dared to speak
of the power of God's love? At the recent Academy Awards, actor
Christopher Reeve challenged the film industry to &quot;put social
issues ahead of box-office success...[to] continue to take risks.
Let's tackle the issues. In many ways, our film community can do
it better than anyone else.&quot; The same challenge applies to
television and matters of faith.<p> 
   
Listen to the concerns of the faithful. Networks invest vast sums
in market research, yet seemingly don't take into account the
millions who, save for series like Touched By an Angel and
Christy, are offended by the values of television and are tuning
out. The more shows of that kind there are, the more that
audience will watch. And make no mistake about it: studies show
this audience is large and affluent. Executives like ABC's Ted
Harbert know that the industry's frantic pursuit of the 18-to-49
demographic was excessive; they should now turn their attention
to the audience that cherish traditional values. In this way,
networks can boost both their Nielsen ratings and their profits.<p>
   
Television is on the hot seat, and the only way to get off it is
to behave responsibly. Ultimately, this means not content
ratings, or encoding for the V-chip, but rather changing the
values promoted over the airwaves. An increase in
religion-friendly programming can and should be at the center of
such a prime time reformation.<p>

<h2>I. INTRODUCTION</h2> 
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>  
The media continue to miss the story of a religious and moral
resurgence across the country in our politics, in our culture,
and most importantly, in our churches. In their survey The
Churching of America, Roger Finke and Rodney Stark reported that
virtually all Americans believe in God or a universal spirit. A
substantial majority believe they will be called before God on
Judgment Day to account for their sins. The vast majority of
Americans believe the Bible is either the literal or inspired
Word of God, and the Ten Commandments are valid rules for living.
Sixty percent of the populace can be found attending houses of
worship in a given month. This &quot;silent majority&quot; still worships
and reflects on their faith under the radar screen of a
secularized media elite.<p>

Despite officially proclaimed concern in the highest councils of
the national news media that religion and religious issues too
often go ignored, the record demonstrates that the concern has
been matched by little noticeable action. The Media Research
Center's first study of television news coverage of religion and
religious values in 1993 discovered both a surprising paucity of
religion coverage and an overt pattern of advocacy against
traditional values: out of more than 18,000 evening news stories,
only 212 evening news stories dealt with religion. Out of more
than 26,000 morning segments, only 197 dealt directly with
religion. Prime-time magazine programs and Sunday morning
interview shows broached religious subjects on only 18 occasions.
The networks had trouble cracking the one percent barrier with
religion coverage. <p>

Employing the same methodology, the Media Research Center
discovered that religious coverage actually declined in 1994.
Evening news stories rose slightly to 225, but morning segments
declined to 151, and Sunday talk show and magazine show segments
dropped to nine. Thanks in part to events like the papal visit to
the United States in October, 1995's network output on religious
news and issues added up to a slight increase over 1994. The
number of evening news stories rose to 249; morning segments grew
noticeably to 224; and magazine and interview show segments
increased to 15. Despite the slight increase overall, the
networks are still barely cracking the one percent barrier. The
pattern in unchanging: the networks continue to neglect people
and issues of faith in their everyday reporting. When religion is
covered, hostility toward traditional religious positions on
social issues remains overt and sometimes unrebutted.  <p>

<a name="quan"</a>
<h2>II. QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF NETWORK NEWS COVERAGE </h2>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
<pre>
  <h3>A. Evening News Stories</h3>

  Out of an estimated 18,000 segments last year on the five network
  programs evaluated (ABC's World News Tonight, CBS Evening News,
  CNN's World News, NBC Nightly News, and The MacNeil-Lehrer
  NewsHour on PBS) the networks devoted only 249 stories to
  religion or religious issues in 1995, a slight increase (11
  percent) from 1994.<p>

  Only 143 of these were reporter-based stories (compared to 106
  anchor briefs), an increase of nine stories from the previous
  year's full story total. <p>

  As in past years, news stories perhaps tangentially related to
  religious issues (in this year's case, the Million Man March led
  by Rev. Louis Farrakhan) were only included if they involved
  issues of religion or theology.<p>

  CNN's World News tied with ABC for the highest number of religion
  stories with 65, even though ABC's World News Tonight lasts only
  half as long. The quantity of news coverage is also determined by
  the length of each story: only 23 (35 percent) of ABC's stories
  were anchor briefs, compared to 47 segments (or 72 percent) of
  CNN coverage. CNN's total was three stories less than 1994, while
  ABC reported 15 stories more than the year before. <p>

  CBS improved to 50 stories, up from 31 stories in 1993 and 46 in
  1994. NBC trailed with 43, the same number as 1994 and 11 less
  than 1993. For the third straight year, The MacNeil-Lehrer
  NewsHour lagged far behind the others with 26 stories, eight more
  than 1994.<p>

  But only 11 were reporter-based stories or interview segments.   
  The Catholic Church again led the coverage with 111 stories, up
  from 103 in 1994. Fully 68 percent of the total (76 stories) were
  anchor briefs, not full-length, reporter-based stories. Generic
  religion stories (without specific reference to denominations),
  often on subjects like school prayer or church-state relations,
  came in second with 70 stories. Once again, news of individual
  Protestant denominations was nearly absent -- five for the
  Southern Baptists, four on Episcopalians, two on Anglicans.
  Muslims drew nine stories; Jews six; Mormons six; Buddhists five;
  Hindus, Greek Orthodox, and Russian Orthodox, one each. Unlike
  1994, when it outnumbered all stories on individual Protestant
  denominations combined, New Age spirituality attracted only one
  evening news story in 1995.<p>
 

  <h3>B. Morning Shows<p></h3>

  Despite a full two hours daily for news and interviews, adding up
  to more than 26,000 segments in 1995, the major network morning
  shows (ABC's Good Morning America, CBS This Morning, and NBC's
  Today) devoted 224 morning show stories to religion in 1994.
  That's not very impressive in terms of the tens of thousands of
  morning segments, but it is a noticeable one-third increase over
  1994, if not a significant increase from the 197 morning news
  stories in 1993.<p>

  Like 1994, the networks were closely matched in their amount of
  coverage. NBC led again with 80 segments, up from 52 in 1994; CBS
  aired 74, up from 48 in 1994; and ABC aired 70, up from 50
  segments in the previous year. Of the 224 stories, more than half (115
  stories) were anchor briefs.<p>

  Greater emphasis on religion interview segments may be partially
  responsible for the increase. NBC interviewed &quot; dissident
  Catholic&quot;  priest and author Andrew Greeley on five occasions. CBS
  devoted an hour of This Morning to a rabbi, a priest, and a
  Protestant pastor. ABC began airing the "God Squad" duo of Father
  Thomas Hartman and Rabbi Marc Gellman in mid-year, relying on
  them for 12 of their 23 interviews in 1995. Gellman's appearances
  substantially heightened the visibility of Jewish voices on the
  networks from past years. Counting Father Hartman's appearances,
  159 stories (71 percent) of the morning coverage featured the
  Catholic Church, a great increase from 63 stories in 1994, a year
  which lacked a papal visit.  <p>


  <h3>C. Magazine/Interview Shows</h3>

  The blind spot to religious news remains especially noticeable on
  Sunday morning interview shows and prime-time magazine programs.
  Analysts reviewed the Sunday shows (ABC's This Week with David
  Brinkley, CBS's Face the Nation, NBC's Meet the Press) as well as
  the prime-time magazine lineup (ABC's Day One, Prime Time Live,
  and 20/20; CBS's Eye to Eye with Connie Chung, 48 Hours, and 60
  Minutes; and NBC's three-night Dateline format). Out of roughly
  400 shows, the number of religion stories rose from nine in 1994
  to 15 in 1995, including segment repeats. But that also includes
  three one-hour programs on religion: a March 15 Peter Jennings
  Reporting special, a September 8 CBS Reports on the religious
  right, and an October 5 48 Hours focusing on the papal visit. Out
  of roughly 150 shows between the three networks, only one Sunday
  morning interview focused on religion: a May 21 segment of Meet
  the Press with Ralph Reed of the Christian Coalition and Clinton
  aide George Stephanopoulos. <p>

<h2>III. QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF RELIGION COVERAGE AND SOCIAL ISSUES</h2>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
<pre>
 <h3> A. Institutions</h3>

  Institutional coverage of religion again focused mainly on the
  Catholic Church, and reporters focused on the unpopularity of
  Church teachings among the American laity: 15 stories highlighted
  poll results finding a majority of American Catholics rejecting
  Church stands. These polls continued to ignore the statistical
  significance on the issues between Catholics who attend church
  weekly and lapsed Catholics who seldom or never attend Mass.
  The networks again portrayed the traditional Church as an
  oppressive, narrow-minded hierarchy with outdated moral concepts.
  Again, in stories and interviews, moral equivalence was awarded
  to self-proclaimed &quot; dissidents&quot;  with a pro-abortion, pro-gay,
  feminist agenda. A case study is the January 22, 1995 60 Minutes.
  Mike Wallace devoted an entire segment to Call to Action, a
  Chicago-based group of &quot; dissidents.&quot;  Wallace portrayed this group
  as a credible, moderate voice for respectable Catholics: &quot; Among
  the things they challenge is the Pope's position on birth
  control, on women becoming priests, and on priests being able to
  marry....There's no denying that for many American Catholics,
  those teachings have lost their appeal.&quot; <p>

  Wallace characterized his subjects as &quot; hardly wild-eyed radicals,
  these people from Call to Action. They're sober church workers,
  nuns and priests, and just plain concerned Catholics....their
  ideals formed in the heady age of change back in the '60s.&quot;  These
  people had decidedly un-sober things to say. Father Mike Flager
  denounced the Church as &quot; spiritually bankrupt&quot;  and said the
  traditional Church has &quot; a love it or leave it, you know, it's
  that crazy patriotism philosophy.&quot;  Edwina Gately &quot; was described
  as a devout Catholic with the tongue of a pagan tart.&quot;  Gately
  replied: &quot; Well I'm OK with the `pagan tart,' it's the `devout
  Catholic' that worries me.&quot;  Wallace reminded her she once said
  &quot; the Vatican is the only tyranny left in the world today.&quot;  <p>

  Wallace's report included 25 soundbites from &quot; dissidents&quot;  without
  broadcasting a single voice in favor of traditional Catholicism.
  Wallace later conceded to the Catholic newspaper Our Sunday
  Visitor that &quot; interviews with Harvard law professor Mary Ann
  Glendon and George Weigel of the Ethics and Public Policy Center,
  prominent lay Catholics who support Church teaching, were not
  used because producers felt the material was too dissimilar to
  work with footage from the Call to Action conference.&quot;  
  When Pope John Paul visited America in October, he underlined the
  Church's historical call to assist the poor, but network analysts
  gave it a secular spin, portraying the remarks as an attack on
  the Republican Party. PBS anchor Robert MacNeil wondered: &quot; Is the
  Pope against the Contract with America?&quot;  CNN anchor Judy Woodruff
  asked Pat Buchanan about the pontiff: &quot; He's certainly been a
  conservative on many theological issues, but many people would
  agree he's been more liberal on social issues, helping the poor,
  he's talked a lot about this. How do you as a Catholic reconcile
  that with what your own party has done this year and is talking
  of doing with regard to cutting back programs for the poor in
  this country?&quot; <p>

  For three morning interviews, NBC brought on Father Andrew
  Greeley to echo that liberal spin: &quot; I heard a Catholic
  conservative last night say that the Pope's words have nothing to
  do with American politics. And I can't imagine anybody being more
  totally wrong. The Pope has come to the United States when it's
  in a very mean-spirited period when it's bashing immigrants,
  bashing poor people, bashing minorities. And the Pope has come to
  say `Hey, stop that!' He isn't talking about specific legislative
  measures, but he's certainly addressing himself to the spirit
  that elected and sustains the Gingrich-Dole Congress.&quot; 
  But later in the same interview, Greeley suggested Catholics can
  ignore the Pope on sexual matters because Greeley thinks he's
  wrong: &quot; Well, most Catholics choose to be Catholic on their own
  terms....they reserve the right to follow their own consciences
  and appeal to a God who does understand.&quot; <p>

  When Ireland moved to lift its ban on divorce, CBS Evening News
  reporter Cinny Kennard applauded on November 18: &quot; Those opposed
  are backed by the mighty Roman Catholic Church that argues
  divorce would profoundly damage the stability and fabric of Irish
  society...Fear is the primary weapon for those who want to
  maintain the ban.&quot;  Kennard highlighted what she felt were more
  enlightened opinions: &quot; For many here, it's more then a referendum
  on the right to remarry. It's another example of the country's
  move to re-invent itself as a more modern and progressive
  Ireland, an Ireland that is more tolerant and open. Recently,
  there has been legal reform on contraception, abortion, and
  homosexuality; signs that the traditional Church grip on Ireland
  has been loosened; signs that the country is increasingly run
  from government buildings and not the Vatican.&quot; <p> 

  Kennard repeated her line on the November 30 CBS This Morning:
  &quot; It's been like an awakening. Ireland, long positioned on the
  world's stage as a church-dominated backwater, has reinvented
  itself as a new and energized Emerald Isle. A more open, a more
  tolerant place.&quot; <p>

  <h3>B. Abortion and Violence (142 in 1995; 247 in 1994; 150  in 1993)<p></h3>

  Social issues bring out the bias in reporters. In a March 2, 1996
  appearance on the CNBC program Cal Thomas, Washington Post
  reporter Howard Kurtz denied that reporters had a liberal
  political bias in favor of the Democrats, but he did suggest &quot; I
  think there is, however, a problem with what I call cultural bias
  on these subjects that you mentioned -- religion, abortion,
  homosexuality. I think a lot of it is unconscious, but I think on
  those kinds of subjects, most reporters are probably to the left
  of the American public and probably don't realize that they're
  not always giving a full weights of views of people who have very
  different take on these matters.<p>

  Reporters may pride themselves on adding context and perspective
  to the issues, but on abortion the networks continue a troubling
  pattern of black/white distinctions: pro-lifers are inextricably
  linked to a violent, radical fringe, while abortion advocates are
  harassed do-gooders operating in the peaceful mainstream. 
  Due to the lack of further violence against abortionists, evening
  newscasts devoted 59 segments to harassment and violence around
  abortion clinics, down almost 60 percent over the 146 segments
  broadcast in 1994. The network morning shows had 82 segments,
  down almost 14 percent from the 95 segments shown in 1994. Magazine
  shows aired only one segment on abortion-related violence in
  1995, down from the six they presented the previous year. Total
  coverage of violence around abortion clinics on all shows amounted to 142
  stories, compared to the 247 in 1994 and 150 segments in 1993. 
  Among the abortion stories not focusing on pro-life violence, the
  networks reported on the debates in Congress over partial birth
  abortions and abortion services at armed forces hospitals, as
  well as the Surgeon General nomination of Dr. Henry Foster, who had
  trouble remembering how many abortions he had performed. Evening
  shows aired 161 total abortion-related segments, morning shows
  245, and magazine shows 11, for a grand sum of 417 segments. On every
  network, pro-life violence stories garnered about one-third of
  the total coverage. That declined from 1994, when pro-life violence
  stories outnumbered other abortion stories by a 2 to 1 margin. 
  Unlike the past two years, religion was not indicted as a
  co-conspirator in pro-life violence. The media did not allude to
  a &quot; link between crime and religion,&quot;  as CBS Evening News anchor Bob
  Schieffer declared two days after Dr. David Gunn was murdered in
  1993. But, once again, the pro-life movement was demonized as a
  dangerous, menacing force.<p>
 
  On January 3, 1995 Jane Pauley promoted an upcoming segment on
  Dateline NBC by charging: "Still ahead -- the latest round of
  bloodshed and violence at abortion clinics. The anti-abortion
  movement has been creeping to the edge of bloody fanaticism for a
  decade. One hundred twenty-nine bombings across the country. And
  while the national debate rages on there have been 600 acts of
  vandalism, firebombings, sniper attacks, windows shattered. There
  is no way to measure the fear or count the death threats.&quot; 
  All this one-sided coverage has an effect on the public's
  perception of the pro-life movement. Reporter David Culhane
  conveyed the results of a CBS poll on this topic during the
  January 8 CBS Evening News: &quot; A new CBS poll shows that three out
  of four Americans say the protest tactics of some anti-abortion
  activists can be blamed for leading to the recent shootings at
  several abortion clinics.&quot; <p> 

  What about violence perpetrated by abortion advocates? In 1994, 
  only CNN reported (in passing) that Ernest Robertson Jr. tried to
  shoot a pro-life protester after picking up his wife outside a
  Baton Rouge, Louisiana abortion clinic. He shot once and missed,
  and then his gun jammed. He was later charged with attempted
  second-degree murder. But in 1995, the networks again
  demonstrated their pro-abortion bias by failing to report on
  harassment or threats of violence against pro-lifers, despite
  some important stories all the networks missed. <p>

  For example, Daniel Adam Mahoney was the first pro-abortion
  activist indicted under the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances
  Act on April 11, 1995. Mahoney called a crisis pregnancy center,
  First Way of Wenatchee, Washington, on January 2 and threatened
  to kill the workers at the center. He also called the National
  Life Center hotline in New Jersey and told an operator he was
  going to shoot pro-life protesters outside abortion clinics. He
  pleaded guilty to both crimes on June 7. This was reported by the
  Associated Press and The New York Times, but never appeared on
  the networks. <p>

  Alice Hand was arrested in January 1995 for making at least three
  phone calls threatening to blow-up a Catholic church and school
  in Suffern, New York. Hand wanted revenge on the Catholic Church,
  which she believed was partly to blame for pro-life violence. The
  New York Times ran a 288-word story on January 17, but the
  incident never appeared on any of the networks. <p>

  While the networks devoted 142 stories to violence outside
  clinics, only three alluded to violence inside the clinics. CNN's
  September 12 World News broadcast one segment about abortionist David
  Benjamin, who was convicted of second degree murder in New York
  City for allowing a woman to bleed to death from a perforated
  uterus during an abortion. Not one segment mentioned the rate of
  abortions in the United States in 1993 or 1994, but two segments
  aired estimates in 1995. On the August 23 Today show, Dawn
  Fratangelo reported a new study estimated that &quot; one-quarter of
  the world's pregnancies end in abortion,&quot;  while the August 30 NBC
  Nightly News mentioned there are 1.5 million abortions per year
  in the United States. <p>

  With 1995 ushering in a new Republican-controlled Congress, the
  media predicted the death of the right to abortion while betting
  it would be an issue that threatens the survival of the Republican
  majority. After Senators voted to make the gruesome partial birth
  abortion procedure illegal on December 7, NBC's Bryant Gumbel
  opened the next day's Today show with this exaggerated claim:
  &quot; Good Morning. Congress is a step closer this morning to eliminating a
  woman's choice in abortion.&quot; <p>
  During the congressional fight over the nomination of Dr. Henry
  Foster as Surgeon General, NBC's Jim Miklaszewski on the February
  9 Today show felt this would eventually be a win for President
  Clinton: &quot; White House officials claim conservative Republicans
  want to turn Foster's nomination into a fight over abortion. In that
  case, Clinton aides admit they could still lose the nomination,
  but would ultimately win the war of public opinion over choice and
  help push the Republicans further right from center.&quot;  CBS anchor
  Connie Chung also saw abortion as bringing about the demise of the
  Republican Party on the February 15 CBS Evening News: &quot; Republican
  use of the abortion issue against Dr. Henry Foster's nomination
  as Surgeon General seems to be backfiring tonight. The deep stress
  cracks over abortion policy are now starting to show inside the
  Republican Party.&quot; <p>
  Once again, a year passed with the concerns of pro-lifers ignored
  by the networks. Women who regret abortions, how the abortion
  industry operates relatively free of government regulation, the
  large sums of money made by the abortion industry, government
  subsidies to Planned Parenthood -- all went unreported in 1995. <p>

  <h3>C. Homosexuality (113 total stories in 1995; 105 in
  1994; 756 in 1993)<p></h3>

  The number of stories primarily about homosexuality remained
  about the same between 1994 and 1995. Both years were much lower
  than 1993 when the gays in the military debate dominated the news
  for a few months. In 1995, 59 evening show segments were
  broadcast focusing on gay issues, the same number as in 1994.
  Morning shows aired 48 stories in 1995, up from the 37 broadcast
  in 1994.<p>

  Magazine show segments dropped from nine in 1994 to six in 1995. 
  But the networks demonstrated a liberal orientation once again:
  most of the segments featured gays in a positive light while
  rarely presenting those who opposed the gay agenda. In what few
  interview segments there were on the morning shows, the number of pro-gay
  agenda guests outnumbered the anti-gay agenda guests by thirteen
  to three. <p>

  <h3>D. Religious Right (17 evening stories in 1995; 12 in
  1994; 15 in 1993)<p></h3>

  In the 34 total segments and one hour CBS Reports special, the
  media reported on Christian conservatives in 1995 as an
  intolerant and divisive force in American politics willing to
  dishonestly manipulate voters into casting a ballot for their
  candidates. The label &quot; extremist&quot;  sometimes popped up in a
  discussion of Christian conservatives. Bryant Gumbel asked Gary
  Hart on the October 17 Today: &quot; How do you view the GOP's
  courtship of the extreme and religious right?&quot; <p>

  The networks portrayed the Christian Coalition as a negative
  force in the Republican Party. Today co-host Katie Couric
  reflected this view in a February 13 interview with Ralph Reed
  about the effect his organization, the Christian Coalition, would
  have on the presidential race: &quot; Do you believe, Mr. Reed, that
  your stand will divide the Republican Party in a way that will
  make it difficult, if not impossible, to win in the election in
  1996? And isn't that what went wrong in the last election for
  George Bush?&quot;  On the September 8 CBS Evening News, Linda Douglass
  also saw sure defeat for a candidate with Christian right
  support: &quot; Christian conservatives may not have the power to
  anoint a candidate, but they might be able to defeat one.
  Embracing their views may help to win the Republican nomination,
  but it could cost votes in the general election.&quot; <p>

  While the networks would not suggest that a liberal group like
  the NAACP doesn't represent all black people, CBS suggested the
  Christian Coalition did not represent all Christians -- or
  suggested they were less than Christian. Rather introduced
  Douglass's September 8 story by noting Phil Gramm &quot; was at a
  meeting of preacher Pat Robertson's political group, the one calling
  itself the Christian Coalition.&quot;  Four months earlier, on May 15, Rather
  charged: &quot; The group calling itself the Christian Coalition is
  aligned with hard-right stands on issues ranging from gay rights
  to school prayer, and it's demanding its due for its help in getting
  Republicans elected.&quot; The networks also suggested conservatives weren't honest about
  their politics. Paula Zahn's question on the November 15 This
  Morning to the director of the liberal Texas Freedom Alliance:
  &quot; Hasn't some of your criticism been, though, that they have
  funded stealth candidates? That these people have not been honest about
  what their agenda is as they go around campaigning?&quot;       
  Some of the worst bias towards the Christian right was broadcast
  during the murder trial of Susan Smith, who drowned her two sons.
  The same media which decried Newt Gingrich's 1992
  characterization of Woody Allen having Democratic family values took a gratuitous
  slap at the Christian Coalition. Both CBS and NBC aired reports
  mentioning, as NBC reporter Bob Dotson described on July 28, that
  Susan Smith's &quot; stepfather, Bev Russell, former Republican Party
  chairman and once active in the Christian Coalition, began
  molesting Susan just before her 16th birthday.&quot; <p>

  The usually little covered religious left garnered a few pieces
  during the year. These segments were mostly platforms for the
  religious left to attack the religious right. NBC's Bob Abernethy
  profiled leftist activist Rev. Jim Wallis who mounted a campaign
  to bash Christian pro-family conservatives. Anchor Brian Williams
  introduced the May 20 piece: "The religious right is continuing a
  political offensive it started a few years ago but there is a
  growing number of religious people who find the conservative
  agenda offensive.&quot; <p>

  Abernethy then aired Wallis's attack: &quot; His biggest problem with
  the Christian Coalition is its programs towards the poor. Wallis
  is a founder of Sojourners Religious Community which believes
  Christianity requires ministry to the poor.&quot;  Then Abernethy posed
  the question, &quot; And when Christians identify with the rich and
  powerful?&quot;  Wallis replied, &quot; I don't want to overstate this but I
  think that's a heresy. &quot;   Abernethy left out the far-left agenda of
  Sojourners, the magazine that Wallis edited; nor did he mention
  that Wallis was once quoted as saying he hoped &quot; more Christians
  will view the world through Marxist eyes.&quot;  Network coverage
  suggested the &quot; stealth&quot;  political tactics of the religious are
  newsworthy only if they are coming from the right. <p>

<h2>IV. RECOMMENDATIONS AND FOLLOW-UP</h2>
<p>[ <a href="#cont">Table of Contents</a> ]<p>
Network coverage of religion and religious issues would improve
considerably if reporters, producers, and anchors would work
harder on the following items:<p>
<ol>
<li> Devote more resources and air time to covering religion news.
The networks have no excuse to keep religion news in a
one-percent ghetto. The role of religion in the larger society,
from private philanthropy to political struggles like Henry
Foster's Surgeon General nomination, were eminently newsworthy
and attention-grabbing in 1995, and yet the networks continue to
slight religion as a major motivating force in Americans' private
and public lives.<p> 

<li> When covering religion, try harder to present religious issues
in a fair-minded, objective way. Network reporters are veterans
at the top of their field. Surely, they cannot protest they don't
know how to present both sides of a story, and they cannot
protest that stories attacking traditional religious "dogma"
without an opposing view is objective journalism. Reporters
should balance the Pope with his critics, but you can't balance a
story with 25 soundbites of critics and no defenders.<p>

<li> Present the social positions of religious figures fairly and
without contempt. The networks continue to label traditional
religious positions on social issues as &quot; extreme&quot;  or &quot; hard
right.&quot;  Is that label accurate for many Catholic clergymen who
are opposed to abortion, but also opposed to capital punishment
and current welfare reform proposals? Ideological identification
is useful to viewers, but current practices serve more to
stigmatize and caricature religious figures. More nuance and
balance is essential.<p>

Reporters also signal their contempt by underlining their opinion
that traditional religious stands are unpopular. An earlier Media
Research Center study of print and network abortion coverage from
July 1994 through June 1995 found that 48 stories suggested
abortion would damage Republican chances for election, while only
one story suggested it would help. But how does that jibe with
the fact that not one pro-life incumbent lost in the 1994
elections? <p>

<li> Hire a religion reporter, and reporters who are religious. ABC
hired Peggy Wehmeyer early in 1994, and she remains the only
explicitly assigned religion reporter at the networks. Wehmeyer
reported 11 stories in ABC's significantly longer &quot; American
Agenda&quot;  format in 1995, the same number as 1994. Wehmeyer was
outnumbered by full-time general assignment reporter Bill
Blakemore, who often covered the Pope for ABC. Time religion
writer Richard Ostling logged six stories for PBS. NBC's Bob
Abernethy continued as a semi-retired &quot; contributing correspondent
on religion.&quot;  CNN and CBS have yet to hire a regular religion
correspondent. The hostile, even partisan tone of some program
content suggests no effort to increase people of faith in the
newsroom. The strong dedication national journalism organizations
publicly declare toward diversity in the newsroom is still
unextended to people of faith.<p>
</ol>
Some recommendations from past MRC studies have led to better
reporting. In 1993, 25 network news stories focused on
unsubstantiated charges of sexual abuse made against Joseph
Cardinal Bernardin. Like 1994, the networks did refrain from
sensationalism in covering serious charges of clerical sexual
abuse. We also recommended that religion news not follow the
formula that `good news is no news.' <p>

On this front, the networks continue to show improvement: Network
reporters did show viewers some examples of the good news that
religion brings to America. On the November 7 World News Tonight,
ABC's Peter Jennings made a startling discovery: &quot; In Texas, there
is a faith-based program which has been remarkably effective in
dealing with alcohol and drug addiction. It does not cost the
taxpayers a cent." Peggy Wehmeyer reported: &quot; A recent University
of Tennessee study showed that 70 percent of Teen Challenge
[program] graduates were drug-free after six months,&quot;  compared
with a state-funded rehabilitation specialist's suggestion that a
25 percent rate would be &quot; very good.&quot;  Acknowledgments that
religion can lead to a better society, in both large systemic
strokes and much smaller personal revelations, might serve as a
comforting respite from the &quot; hell in a handbasket&quot;  tone so many
Americans associate with the network news.

</B></I> </CENTER></U>
<BR>
<P>On June 5, Media Research Center Chairman Brent Bozell held a national press 
conference in Washington, D.C. to formally announce our $2.8 million<B> "Tell the 
Truth!"</B> campaign to confront and neutralize the anti-conservative bias in the media during the `96 election season.
<P>At the press conference, Bozell told reporters that surveys confirm what some in 
the media are finally admitting. "CBS's 
Bernard Goldberg said it best: `The old argument 
that the networks and other "media elites" have 
a liberal bias is so blatantly true it's hardly worth discussing 
any more.'
<P>"The MRC is not out to prove an anti-conservative bias. That argument is over," 
Bozell stated. "We want to put an end to this 
non-stop onslaught against the conservative movement. 
This campaign demands the media be fair and balanced, period," 
he continued.
<P>Media outlets covering the press conference included 
C-SPAN, CNN, CBN, Reuters, Cox, <I>The</I> <I>Washington 
Post</I>, <I>National Review</I>, <I>Chicago 
Sun-Times</I>, <I>Investor's Business 
Daily</I>, and others.
"Tell the Truth!" is the most ambitious and technologically 
advanced campaign ever devised to confront leftist media bias. 
Based on test-marketing results, we will expose left-wing media bias to an average 
of 50,000 conservative activists and 25 million voters every week. 
<I><B>The media will not get away with distortions or falsehoods this year.</B></I>
<p>
<BR>
<BR>
 <I><CENTER><font size="5">There are nine components to the campaign:</font size="5"></CENTER></I>
<P>
<BR>
<B>1. Research:</B> The cornerstone of all MRC endeavors, the campaign research will 
be compiled by our eight-member media analysis team which tapes and analyzes every 
network newscast, national newspaper, and news magazine to document trends of 
liberal bias. Using the customized MRC Media 
Tracking
 System, the "Tell the Truth!" 
campaign will show the American people <I>exactly 
</I>how the media are distorting the issues -- 
even spiking the news -- in order to promote their pro-Clinton agenda this year.
<P><B>2. Publications:</B> All of the MRC's 
monthly and bi-weekly publications -- 
<I>MediaWatch</I>, <I>MediaNomics</I>, <I>Notable 
Quotables</I>, and <I>Flash </I> -- will focus almost exclusively on the 
issuesand trends of campaign `96, giving thousands of conservative reporters, subscribers, and activists the unique and timely information which they can use as ammunition in their grassroots activism.
<P><B>3. <I>Pattern of Deception</I>:</B><I> </I>MRC 
Associate Editor Tim Graham's new blockbuster book documents the astonishing bias that has 
bolstered the Clinton presidency in the last four years, setting the stage for a national 
discussion of the media's obvious preference for this President. 
<I>Pattern of Deception</I> has already generated great interest among 
the general public, and become one of our best selling publications.
<P><B>4. Talk Radio:</B> Over the past year we 
have quietly established an informal network of over 100 radio talk shows 
-- which includes every major nationally syndicated show -- 
to provide them with up-to-the-minute evidence of left-wing bias masquerading as 
"objective news" in the establishment press. Using MRC material, talk show hosts can now educate millions of voters about the 
ongoing distortion of the "news" media every 
single day. As well, MRC spokesmen are now conducting daily interviews on these shows 
to further expose the liberal media.
<P><B>5. The Internet:</B> Using the Internet, the MRC will be communicating with 
hundreds of thousands of conservative activists 
while simultaneously providing immediate intelligence to the conservative media. The 
MRC website  <a href="http://www.mediaresearch.org">http://www.mediaresearch.org</a> is up and running for public and media 
use during the 1996 campaign, with a full slate of studies, profiles, and Special Reports. In addition, MRC Executive Director Brent Baker is providing "CyberAlerts" through E-mail several times per week to the nation's most influential opinion leaders to facilitate a rapid response to media bias.  
<P><B>6. Media Outreach:</B> Two-page &quot;Media Reality Check '96&quot; rebuttals are 
being sent via &quot;blast fax&quot; to over 1,500 media and political contacts across 
the country on a regular basis. This rapid response technique, honed to 
perfection by the Clinton campaign in 1992, inundated the media with 
counterarguments and rebuttals to anything the Republicans had to say. Now we're 
using it against the leftist media.  
<P><B>7. The National Conventions:</B> During the national conventions, 
the media's left-wing agenda comes shining through. Once again, the MRC 
will be there, publishing a daily newsletter during the two parties' conventions 
to document the ongoing political slant in prime time convention coverage. 
In addition, we will be conducting interviews and press conferences to 
broadcast our findings. This year the MRC is also considering a daily national 
radio feed to provide evidence of reporters' biased coverage. This daily 
commentary will reach tens of millions of voters and activists.
<P><B>8. Conservative Grassroots Activism:</B> To make the so-called 
objective national media an issue in this campaign, the MRC is mass-producing 
and distributing hundreds of thousands of bumper stickers, pens, 
refrigerator magnets, and other novelty items with the tag line &quot;I Don't Believe the 
Liberal News Media.&quot; The national 
distribution efforts are already under way. MRC Members -- 75,000 nationwide -- 
will also participate through letter-writing campaigns and other efforts to 
expose and confront liberal bias at the local level.
<P><B>9. Paid Advertising: </B>The MRC will be advancing its efforts through a 
paid advertising campaign. Conservative newspapers, magazines, and radio 
talk shows will be the vehicles of choice for these efforts. So far the MRC 
has placed several advertisements in <I>Human 
Events</I> and the <I>Washington Times Weekly</I>, and we will be buying 
advertisements in <I>National Review</I> and 
<I>The American Spectator</I>. Funds permitting, ads will air on radio and television 
as well.<BR>

<b><center><i><font size="5">MRC Family Hour Campaign Gets Results</font size="5"></i></center></b>
<br>
<br>
<P>The Media Research Center's campaign to bring the spirit 
          of the Family Hour back to prime time television has achieved 
national attention and impressive results. 
<P>At the end of April, the MRC organized a coalition of United States 
Senators and Representatives to issue a bi-partisan challenge to the 
television networks to voluntarily bring back the spirit of the Family Hour. 
Over 70 members of Congress signed a letter urging network 
entertainment executives to voluntarily broadcast only shows advocating 
positive family values during the first hour of prime time. The letter appeared 
as a full-page ad purchased by the MRC in the show-business newspaper 
<I>Daily Variety</I>.
<P>MRC Chairman Brent Bozell followed up with a lobbying effort 
directed at ABC Entertainment President Ted Harbert asking him to renew the 
highly acclaimed family drama <I>Second Noah</I>, which debuted this past February 
and whose survival hung in the balance.The advertisement and lobbying effort had demonstrable results.
 <P>On May 20, ABC announced that <I>Second 
Noah</I> would be included on its fall schedule, to air Saturdays at 
8 p.m. EDT. Subsequently, the show's creator and executive producer, 
Pamela Long, enthusiastically thanked Bozell and the MRC, writing that 
the <I>Daily Variety</I> ad &quot;struck just the 
right chord. And Ted Harbert...heard you loud and clear.&quot;       
<P>Bozell's &quot;eloquent letter to Mr. Harbert had a definitive impact on 
the decision-making process at the network,&quot; echoed Jacqueline 
Lovejoy, the show's publicist. &quot;[His] voice 
was powerful, and it was heard.&quot;
<P>Brandon Tartikoff, chairman of New World Television, 
<I>Second Noah</I>`s production company, has also 
recognized the MRC's work on the program's behalf. Tartikoff told 
<I>Flash</I> that &quot;support by Brent Bozell and his 
joint efforts with members of Congress... not only influenced ABC's decision 
to pick up the show, but also influenced the placement of 
<I>Second Noah</I> on Saturday nights, among the best times 
for family viewing.&quot; <BR>
<center><h2><I>The Top Ten Least and Most Family Friendly Shows of 
1995-'96</I></center>
</h2>
As MRC studies have shown, while the number of youth-targeted prime time series incorporating pernicious content has increased, wholesome shows are also gaining strength. The MRC's Entertainment Division recently released its &quot;Top Ten&quot; list of the least family-friendly prime time shows, but also saluted several programs which respect and uphold traditional values.
<P>
<P><I>The Top Ten Least and Most Family Friendly Shows of 
1995-'96</I>, which has been distributed to thousands of 
journalists, is the culmination of thousands of hours of television analysis. As 
of press time, this annual season-end tally has received widespread coverage 
in several major media outlets, including <I>USA 
Today</I>,<I> The Washington Post</I>, and the<I> Los Angeles 
Times</I>. It was even mentioned on the<I> Tonight 
Show</I>. 
<h3><P><B><center>The Top Ten Worst Shows:</center></B></h3>
<P>1.<B><I>Married...with Children</B></I> (Fox) Sunday 
9:00 p.m. EST
<P>The crudest comedy on prime time television, 
<I>Married</I> routinely ridicules the family. Every 
week members of the &quot;Bundys&quot; trade insults, 
celebrate promiscuity, and revel in bathroom 
humor; this raunchfest's dialogue is peppered with 
lewd punch lines about sex, masturbation, the gay 
lifestyle, and the lead character's fondness for pornographic magazines 
and strip clubs.
<P>2. <B><I>Friends </B></I>(NBC) Thursday 8:00 
p.m. EST
<P><I>Friends</I> has not toned down its adult content 
despite the show's shift to the earlier 8 o'clock hour. 
Virtually every episode revolves around sexual themes and contains 
inappropriate language. Each of the six central characters, 
all single twentysomethings, is sexually active. 
Additionally, the sitcom promotes gay parenting and same-sex marriages as viable options.
<P>3. <B><I>Roseanne</B></I> (ABC) Tuesday 8:00 p.m. EST
<P>Like<I> Friends, Roseanne</I>'s move to the 8:00 p.m. time slot has done 
little to mitigate the show's obnoxious content. The series' central characters 
are openly derisive of their parents; religion and the 
religious are mocked; foul language is frequent; 
premarital sex is condoned; and  gay marriage is championed.
<P>4. <B><I>Melrose Place</B></I> (Fox) Monday 
8:00 p.m. EST
<P><I>Melrose</I>'s randy regulars are constantly 
in and out of one another's beds, engaging in premarital and extramarital sex. 
Prime time's sexiest soap also showcases the gay lifestyle, with one gay 
character gaining a live-in lover this season.
<P>5. <B><I>A Season in Purgatory</B></I> (CBS) 
Mini-series
<P>Based on a Dominick Dunne novel, <I>Season</I> showcased members of 
a supposedly devout Catholic family promoting their faith in public 
while privately engaging in a vast array of premarital and extramarital 
affairs, rape, murder, and scandalous cover-up schemes. 
<P>6. <B><I>Central Park West</B></I> (CBS) 
Wednesday 9:00 p.m. EST (Canceled)
<P>One of the most hyped entries on last fall's schedule, 
<I>CPW</I> condoned premarital sex and adultery, 
and aired scenes containing foul language and explicitly sexual 
content. Fortunately, the acting and writing were so poor that very few viewers tuned in to its 
sordidness, and it was canceled.
<P>7. <B><I>The Dana Carvey Show</B></I> (ABC) 
Tuesday 9:30 EST (Canceled)
<P>The popular comedian shocked viewers and sponsors with 
obscenity-laden skits and extremely crude content. After many advertisers 
withdrew their support and ratings began to wane, ABC pulled the show off the air.
<P>8. <B><I>Cybill</B></I> (CBS) Sunday 8:00 p.m. EST
<P><I>Cybill</I>'s storylines frequently test the limits of decency. Dialogue is 
littered with foul language, sexual innuendo, and suggestive scenarios. 
The sitcom's regulars frequently belittle the institution of marriage. Casual sex 
-- even among teenagers -- is condoned.
<P>9. <B><I>Beverly Hills, 90210 </B></I>(Fox) 
Wednesday 8:00 p.m. EST
<P>While one character has steadfastly refused to lose her virginity, 
other members of <I>90210</I>'s tanned and trendy cast have been more than happy 
to promote premarital sex as a natural -- and completely inconsequential --  
fact of college life. The teen-targeted soap sends mixed messages on drugs. 
Some protagonists deride substance abuse, but rarely do they ever address the illegality of drug use.
<P>10.<B><I> Martin</B></I> (Fox) Thursday 8:00 
p.m. EST
<P>The sex lives of the two newlywed protagonists and their single 
friends serve as fodder for the raunchy humor pervading this sitcom. Most 
of <I>Martin</I>'s episodes contain dialogue fraught with sexual references and 
obscene language.

<br>
<h3><P><B><center>The Most Family-Friendly Shows of 1995-`96:</center></h3></B>
<P>
<br>
<B><I>Touched by an Angel</B></I> (CBS) Saturday 9:00 p.m. EST
<P>One of CBS' few success stories of the season, 
<I>Touched By an Angel</I> is the most outspoken proponent of 
traditional values on the prime time schedule. The inspiring drama 
showcases God's message of unconditional love, illuminates the power of 
prayer, and promotes compassion and strengthening family ties. 
<I>Touched By an Angel</I>, almost canceled last year 
by CBS, was the fastest growing series on the network and the second 
fastest growing show on prime time during the 1995-`96 season. 
<P><B><I>Second Noah</B></I> (ABC) Saturday 8:00 p.m. EST
<P>This mid-season replacement about a novelist, his veterinarian 
wife, and their eight adopted children is one of prime time's most 
pro-family offerings. Storylines depict respect for parental authority as the key to 
a strong family unit, and advocate premarital chastity, individual 
responsibility, and faith.
<P><B><I>Kirk</B></I> (WB) Sunday 8:30 p.m. EST
<P>The cornerstone of WB's family-friendly line-up, every episode 
of <I>Kirk</I> reiterates the importance of family. The title character, a 
young man suddenly charged with the upbringing of his three younger 
siblings, willingly makes many personal sacrifices to ensure 
that the children are receiving a sound moral upbringing. The show 
imparts the merits of hard work, faith, patience, and taking 
responsibility for one's actions.
<P>   <BR>
<B><I>Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman</B></I> (CBS) 
Saturday 8:00 p.m. EST
<P><I>Dr. Quinn</I>'s promotion of family values has 
endeared it to audiences of all ages. Marriage and 
family are staunchly promoted, as are honesty, compassion, and 
respect for parental authority. The drama boasts one of 
prime time's most positive clerics, &quot;the Reverend.&quot; A 
series regular, he is depicted as an intelligent, 
caring, and dedicated member of the community.
<P><B><I>Home Improvement</B></I> (ABC) Tuesday  9:00 p.m. EST
<P>This popular sitcom remains a reliable family staple. Focusing 
primarily on the relationships between a cable TV host, his wife, and their 
children, <I>Home Improvement</I> has taught valuable lessons about teenage 
drinking, honesty, respect, and the importance of education. One of prime 
time's foremost advocates of the institution of marriage, the show frequently addresses the 
challenges faced by the husband and wife and the 
steps they take toward strengthening their relationship. 
<P><B><I>Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of 
Superman</B></I> (ABC) Sunday 8:00 p.m. EST
<P><I>Lois &amp; Clark</I> abandoned the suggestive 
dialogue and sexual references of its 1993-'94 inaugural season, and, 
in the words of series star Teri Hatcher, is now &quot;the family show 
to watch.&quot; The show's cleverly scripted storylines prove that 
television needn't appeal to the lowest common denominator to provide 
quality entertainment. Dialogue and fast-paced action sequences are free 
of offensive language and sexual innuendo, and the newly engaged 
protagonists promote premarital chastity.
<P><B><I>The Parent `Hood</B></I> (WB) Sunday 7:30 p.m. EST
<P>Another winning offering from WB, <I>The Parent 
`Hood'</I>s central characters provide positive 
role models for viewers of all ages. The happily married black 
couple, both successful professionals, teach their children 
that education, self-discipline and integrity are keys to 
success. The positive impact of a father in the household, 
family loyalty, and postponing sex until marriage are 
also underscored.

<h2><center>MRC CyberAlerts Conservative Journalists</center></h2>
<P></B><BR>
<P>In response to the growing demand for MRC research, we are using 
state-of-the-art technology to reach conservative leaders instantaneously. Several 
          times a week MRC Executive Director Brent Baker sends &quot;CyberAlert&quot; 
messages via electronic mail to a network of talk radio hosts and key 
conservative leaders in the media. 
<P>Each conservative journalist receives the latest intelligence on the leftist 
media. CyberAlerts' subjects have included the findings from the recent 
Roper Center poll for the Freedom Forum, which showed that 89 percent of 
Washington journalists voted for Clinton, and that only 2 percent considered 
themselves conservative. 
<P>The CyberAlert membership list has grown to include heavy hitters like 
talk show hosts <B>G. Gordon Liddy</B> (nationally syndicated), 
<B>Neal Boortz</B> (WSB, Atlanta), <B>David 
Brudnoy</B> (WBZ, Boston), <B>Mark Davis</B> (WBAP, Fort Worth), 
<B>Jim Eason</B> (KGO, San Francisco), <B>David 
Gold</B> (KLIF, Dallas), <B>Jason Lewis</B> (KSTP, St. 
 Paul), <B>Jan Mickelson</B> (WHO, Des Moines), 
<B>Wes Minter</B> (KCMO, Kansas City), <B>Mike 
Rosen</B> (KOA, Denver), and <B>Barry Young</B> (KFYI, Phoenix). Newspaper 
columnists like <B>Evan Gahr</B> from the <I>New York 
Post</I>, <B>Dick Williams </B>from the <I>Atlanta 
Journal</I>, <B>Don Feder</B> from the <I>Boston 
Herald</I>; and nationally syndicated columnists 
<B>Cal Thomas</B> and <B>Arianna Huffington</B> also use these alerts in 
their stories. Others receiving CyberAlerts include 
<I>The American Spectator</I>'s Editor-in-Chief  
<B>R. Emmett Tyrrell Jr.</B>, and Executive Editor 
<B>Wladyslaw Pleszczynski</B>; <B>Tony Snow</B> from 
<I>Fox News Sunday</I>; and <B>Fred Barnes</B>, the Executive 
Editor of <I>The</I> <I>Weekly Standard</I>.
<P>Overnight these CyberAlerts have become an essential tool for 
conservatives in the media fighting the blatant liberal bias that pervades the mainstream 
media. <br>
<p>
<br>
<b><i><center>And here's some feedback we've received from our CyberAlerts:</center></i></b>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<P>Today's &quot;Media Reality Check&quot; is unbelievably 
<U>great</U> (did it on my radio show). 
You're doing great work.
You were great on Rush , too.
<blockquote>-- A personal note from Mary Matalin, CBS radio talk    
 show host.</blockquote>
<p>
 "As always you are doing a simply superb and bang-up job! I use your material on my show almost every day. Needless to say, your daily updates are 
excellent...&quot; <blockquote>-- Barry Young at KFYI in Phoenix.</blockquote>
<p>
&quot;Thanks...these things are great.&quot; <blockquote>-- Doug Kellett at 
WRCG in Columbus, Georgia.</blockquote>
<P>&quot;You're sending great stuff. Could you add 
<I>World</I>'s Managing Editor Nick Eicher to your distribution list?&quot;  
 <blockquote>-- Marvin Olasky, Editor of <I>World</I> magazine.</blockquote>
<P>
&quot;Vice President Dan Quayle was very intrigued about the 
press' coverage of the Israeli election. He may 
write his weekly column on this subject next week. Do you have 
any more information?&quot; <blockquote>-- Brad Newby from the office of Dan Quayle.</blockquote>
<P>
&quot;Thanks always, for the terrific job and resource you're providing.&quot; 
<blockquote>-- Wes Minter at KCMO, in Kansas City.</blockquote>   
<P>&quot;You're doing a fabulous job! Keep up the 
pressure.&quot; <blockquote>-- Cal Thomas, syndicated columnist.</blockquote>
<P>&quot;I think this fax and E-mail system will spread your 
message more quickly and effectively. Speaking of that, could you add 
my TV colleague, Bill Shipp to your list? [He] now lives in 
Newt's district, puts out a newsletter, and sends his very 
conservative column to 43 newspapers in Georgia.&quot; 
 <blockquote>-- Dick Williams.</blockquote>

<p><br><br>
<h2><B><center>MRC Editor on Entitlement Reform</center></B></h2>
<P>Did you know that if Social Security and Medicare are not reformed, future generations may face tax rates as high as 84 
percent? Or that more young people believe in UFOs than believe they 
will ever get any money from Social Security? You may not have known 
of these unpleasant facts because no one in the media reports them.
<P>But entitlement reform is becoming an increasingly important issue 
in conservative circles, and the MRC is part of the dialogue. Recently 
Tim Lamer, director of the MRC's Free Market Project, participated in a 
panel discussion hosted by the Heritage Foundation's Third Generation 
Program, a series of lectures for young conservatives. Representatives from the Cato Institute and the 
Heritage Foundation also served on the panel while many young conservatives 
from various think tanks and Capitol Hill attended 
the discussion.
<P>All four panelists reflected on why, with the 
impending retirement of the Baby Boom generation, 
entitlement reform is the most important econ-omic 
issue facing young people. Lamer addressed why reforming these programs should be a major concern for all wings of 
the conservative movement and how the movement can bring media 
attention to bear on the issue.<BR>
<br>
<br>
<p>
<h2><B><center>Broader Project Replaces FEMI</center></b></h2>

In order to reflect its new, broad-
      ened focus, the MRC's Free 
      Enterprise &amp; Media Institute (FEMI) has changed its name to 
the <B>Free Market Project</B>.
<P>Beginning this year, the Free Market Project is undertaking 
joint projects with other conservative public policy or business organizations 
to help them educate reporters about their particular concerns. 
Currently, the Free Market Project is engaged in a joint project with Consumer Alert, 
the free-market consumer group, to study how popular consumer 
publications cover business and free enterprise. These projects give the 
conservative movement and the business community the scientific research they need 
to educate the media regarding their biases, and to confront them directly 
if necessary.
<P>In addition to the new joint projects, the Free Market Project 
will continue to publish the newsletter 
<I>MediaNomics</I> on a monthly basis, and FEMI's Quarterly Breakfast Forums, 
designed to educate the media about free enterprise issues, will continue 
to be held every few months.

On May 28, millions 
          of Americans 
          learned exactly how the left-wing press 
are distorting the news thanks to Media Research 
Center Chairman Brent Bozell's stint as guest host of 
Rush Limbaugh's nationally syndicated radio show, 
the most popular program in history. 
<P>Bozell briefed the audience (over 20 million 
listeners, cumulatively) not only on the leftist political 
slant in the news media, but on the cultural war being 
waged in Hollywood as well.
<P>During the show's second hour, Bozell interviewed Hollywood 
legend and fellow conservative activist Charlton Heston, 
who has done more than any other Hollywood figure, aside from Ronald Reagan, to help elect 
conservatives while advancing our cause. Heston is currently 
raising money for the newly formed Arena PAC, 
which was created to elect conservative candidates to 
federal office and to mobilize conservatives in the 
entertainment industry.
<P>One of the highlights of the final hour of the 
radio show was an interview with Republican National 
Committee Chairman Haley Barbour. In addition to addressing the liberal 
media's effect on politics and American culture, 
Bozell asked Barbour what conservatives should do to 
further their ideas and programs. &quot;You have to 
understand that you can't rely on the mainstream media,&quot; 
replied the RNC Chairman. &quot;One of the reasons talk radio 
has exploded in popularity in this country in recent 
years, is that people see that the media elites are liberal, 
and they come at things from their perspective and 
people are looking for another source.&quot; 
<P>Bozell later offered his insights on the 
current campaigns, giving this advice to Dole and other 
conservatives: &quot; They ought to be distinguishing 
themselves from the Democrats. They ought to be 
playing hardball politics with the Democrats. They've got 
the truth on their side. They ought to stop reading 
the <I>Washington Post </I>and listening to the networks 
and thinking that they reflect reality. They ought to 
listen to the voters out there. Look at the surveys -- 
the surveys are all on their side.&quot;
<P>Limbaugh has asked Bozell to return as a guest to discuss the media's 
left-wing agenda -- a welcome invitation given that 
such exposure would normally cost millions of dollars 
if purchased as advertising time.

Wolfe: In this country, in the midst of what could certainly be called the American Century, we remain the most obedient in matters of art -we remain the most obedient little colonial subjects of Europe.

How can David Kessler say he leaves the Food and Drug Administration with his objectives accomplished when someone, somewhere, is still enjoying himself?
<P>
<hr>
<P>
Get ready to see hordes of starving children on the screen, if not the streets. Liberals are gearing up to ``fix'' the welfare bill passed this summer. They want to let noncitizens (and, in their more fanciful moments, single men under 50 who don't work) collect food stamps. Similarly, they want to ease eligibility rules for noncitizens seeking Supplemental Security Income -- currently the fastest-growing welfare program. All told, they would snatch back $13 billion of the $55 billion the welfare bill saved. The First Lady wants to lead this charge. Sounds good to us; maybe she can bring back Ira Magaziner to assist. Republicans in Congress should be looking forward to fighting on this territory. But the liberals are right on one point: the welfare bill <I>should</I> be revisited. Work requirements should be strengthened; under the law only a quarter of recipients have to work by 2002. Medicaid should be cut and block-granted to the states. And the Legal Services Corporation should be prohibited from using federal funds to challenge welfare reform -- or to do anything else, for that matter.
<P>

From the <I>Washington Post</I>: ``President Clinton faces a choice as he returns this week to the business of staffing his Administration for a second term: He will either make history by appointing a woman to one of the two spots on his national-security team, or risk sorely disappointing many of the very voters who provided his margin of victory in last month's election'' (John J. Harris, Dec. 3). Does that mean Mary Landrieu has to staff her Senate office with dead black people?
<P>
<hr>
<P>


Resigning FDA Commissioner David Kessler claims to have been asked by the Clinton Administration to stay on, but that seems unlikely, in view of his recently revealed cheating on job-related travel expenses. According to the published accounts of <I>l'affaire</I> Kessler, he has virtually admitted the misdeeds -- falsifying travel vouchers, double-billing travel expenses and the like -- by returning money to the government. Clearly this commissioner needed a warning label. The most-often-mentioned candidate to replace him is Lynn Goldman, now Assistant Administrator for Pesticides and Toxic Substances at the Environmental Protection Agency. A solid Clinton choice: she's scientifically challenged, has conducted a virtual war on innovation in the biotechnology and pesticide industries, and presides over an organization known for chaotic incompetence (it recently lost two hundred files containing industrial trade secrets). The good news is that she should be unconfirmable by the Republican-controlled Senate.

A devastating front-page headline in the November 18 <I>Washington Post</I> shattered the illusions of the bi-partisan Beltway Establishment: ``IMMIGRATION ISSUES AWAIT NEW CONGRESS: Surging Legal Influx Will Be among Topics of Renewed Debate.'' Rushing to restore these illusions in a December 2 letter to the Editor: Stuart Anderson (alas) of the Cato Institute (alack). Anderson's claim: the current increase (to about one million in 1996) somehow doesn't count, because it's due to the fact that the three million-odd beneficiaries of the 1986 amnesty are now becoming citizens and sponsoring their relatives. Unmentioned corollary to Anderson's claim: eventually this new immigration boom will produce another boom, as these sponsored relatives get to sponsor their own relatives. Unindicted culprit: the misnamed ``family reunification'' principle, which treats immigration as a civil right extended to a randomly selected class of foreigners -- the relatives of recent immigrants -- and divorces it from any American interest. In fact, no serious analyst denies that the 1990s will see record immigration, probably in excess of ten million, bringing with it everything from overcrowded schools to female circumcision. Immigration enthusiasts are committed to a policy that brings them into increasingly desperate conflict with the facts, and common sense.

As Chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee in the last Congress, Sen. Alan Simpson (R., Wyo.) led the unsuccessful Senate fight to reduce legal-immigration levels. Simpson's retirement means that the torch must be passed to a successor. Jon Kyl (R., Ariz.), who firmly supported moderate cuts in immigration, has seniority on the subcommittee, and so the chairmanship is his if he wants it. But Spencer Abraham (R., Mich.), the man most responsible for killing reform of legal immigration in the Senate last year, has been lobbying for the position. While <I>NR</I> admires Sen. Abraham and supports him on most issues (indeed, <I>NR</I> backed him for Chairman of the Republican National Committee four years ago), his misguided views on immigration have consequences too grave to be ignored. <I>NR</I> hopes that Kyl, who understands the urgent need for immigration reform, will take the chairmanship. If he doesn't, appointing Abraham would continue an immigration policy utterly disconnected from our national interests. It would also represent contempt for rank-and-file Republicans, who in an RNC survey supported lower levels of immigration by overwhelming margins. If their views are to be so casually ignored, the RNC should feel the pinch in its next fund appeal. 

<P>
<hr>
<P>

Meanwhile, Haley Barbour's successor as RNC Chairman will be chosen by the RNC's 165 voting members at next month's winter meeting. There is no clear frontrunner among the current candidates, who include RNC General Counsel David Norcross of New Jersey, ex-RNC Co-Chairman Jeanie Austin of Florida, Chuck Yob of Michigan, and Bob Bennett of Ohio. Former New Hampshire Gov. Steve Merrill has also entered the race. Committee conservatives haven't endorsed a candidate but there is no doubt who would be unacceptable to them. National Committeeman Morton Blackwell sees Jeanie Austin as ``actively hostile to traditional conservatives'' and says, `` David Norcross's principal credential is that he has always done exactly what he has been told to do.'' Conservatives hope that Texas GOP Chairman Tom Pauken will join the field. In an ideal world a principled conservative like Pauken, with a thirty-year record of commitment to the movement, would win by acclamation. But until the party's establishment is as conservative as its grassroots, Pauken's supporters can only hope to form a coalition to ensure that a candidate not openly hostile to traditional conservatives wins. Applications from other conservative heavyweights would be welcome. (Confidential to Vin Weber -- now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of the party.)

Turnabout is more than fair play -- sometimes it's positively therapeutic. Now that the Clinton Administration is feeling the lash of the independent-counsel law (latest installment: the Landmark Legal Foundation calls for an independent counsel to investigate Vice President Gore's Buddhist temple fundraising) liberals and Democrats are beginning to question its wisdom. They are right, if tardy. The statute turns political battles, which would be best decided by the public, into legal disputes resolved by grand juries. And it has always been a constitutional bastard, an invention of congressional Democrats to increase their leverage over the Executive Branch. The law expires in 1999, at which point it should be left for dead. Until then, however, Democrats, like Frankenstein, must live with their creation.

For the last five years Bill Clinton has labeled Presidents Reagan and Bush the ``free lunch crowd'' -- the people who ran up the national debt by more than $3 trillion. And for nearly a decade Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia -- pork-barreler extraordinaire -- has proclaimed that the budgets passed by Congress in the 1980s spent less money than the Reagan Administration requested. Byrd and his colleagues were allegedly the tightwads, Ronald Reagan the big spender. A new report by the Institute for Policy Innovation in Lewisville, Texas, entitled, ``Whose Free Lunch? The Truth about the Reagan Deficits,'' balances the books: Reagan's budget requests were lower in every single year that he submitted a budget than the actual amount Congress spent. The total excess spending by Congress over those years was $209 billion. Congress spent $80 billion less than requested on national defense in fiscal years 1982 - 89, but $300 billion more on domestic programs -- mostly entitlements. Yes, we would still have had large budget deficits in the 1980s even if all Reagan's budget requests had been enacted. But those deficits would have been about $25 billion a year <I>lower</I> than the red ink Congress actually spilled. Footnote: the IPI study also shows that every President since Gerald Ford has wanted to spend less money than Congress has. Except for one: Bill Clinton.

Russia's General Aleksandr Lebed paid his first visit to the U.S. in mid November, seeing senior State, Pentagon, and NSC officials and wowing policy wonks in New York and Washington. He was charismatic, articulate, candid -- and shrewd in the moderate impression he fostered. He was eager for good relations with the U.S., he said; Americans and Russians have so much in common (unlike the Europeans). He claimed to be relaxed about NATO enlargement and uninterested in reintegration of the former Soviet republics (``Russia is tired of being the cow that everyone milks'') -- the two usual hobby horses of Russian nationalists. He dined with the Latvian, Lithuanian, and Estonian ambassadors and pledged his respect for their independence. Lebed's preoccupations are clearly domestic -- restoring the dignity of the army; purging the kleptocracy that runs the country; freeing up the economy by reducing government interference. He is a nationalist, devoted to restoring Russia's glory, and a  force. While he avowed his loyalty to Boris Yeltsin, he seems capable of filling any vacuum that should appear. Whether he is ultimately a threat to the West remains to be seen, but he is clearly a more complex -- and perhaps more formidable -- phenomenon than he was originally perceived to be, by <I>NR</I> among others.

Hillary Rodham Clinton stirred up the social scene Down Under, according to the <I>Sydney Morning Herald</I>. Invited to a glitzy reception, she was ``so dissatisfied'' with the guest list that she arranged to have several prominent leftists crash the private party. She explained that she had an important speech to make and wanted somebody there who could ``appreciate'' it, as, presumably, the hostess and the invited guests could not. And Americans think Australians are rude and crude.

Brian Peterson and Amy Grossberg are the 18-year-old college freshmen who went to a motel in Delaware so that Amy could give birth to their child, whom they then tossed in a dumpster, where he was found, dead, the next day. The pair have been charged with first-degree murder, which could carry the death penalty. But why is what  they did so much more heinous than what a doctor might have done a few hours earlier, in a partial-birth abortion? The best line on this ugly affair belongs to George Will. ``Could Delaware choose to execute the two by inserting scissors into the bases of their skulls, opening the scissors, inserting suction tubes, and sucking out their brains? Of course not. The Constitution forbids choosing cruel and unusual punishments.''

The Oakland, California, Board of Education is looking into the claims of the Task Force on the Education of African-American Students that ``most black students need to be classified as bilingual'' because they speak Ebonics.

For several years Joseph Epstein, one of the finest essayists of our time, has been a bone in the throat of the academic establishment. At last they have managed to get rid of him as editor of <I>American Scholar</I>, the quarterly journal of the Phi Beta Kappa society. He had edited that magazine without partisanship, and his own regular essays had been a principal reason for reading it. He despised Victimology, the current academic religion, which earned him the hatred of such usual suspects as the novelist Joyce Carol Oates and feminist Rutgers dean Catherine Stimson. The war against Epstein was conducted on the op-ed page of the <I>New York Times</I> and on the academic grapevine. As Baudelaire remarked to Manet, ``You have the honor of being hated.'' The name of the journal <I>American Scholar</I> recalls Emerson's August 31, 1837, address, which became one of his major essays. Emerson attacked the complacency of the Harvard intelligentsia of his day, and spoke sternly of independence of mind as the duty of the American scholar. Joseph Epstein will continue to write in that spirit, even though he has been fired by a gang of conformist philistines.

<FONT SIZE=+3>F</FONT><font size=+1>OR</font>  the first time in 36 years, there is nobody in line for the next Republican presidential nomination. In fact, nobody has stepped up to become the clear political leader of the conservative movement since Ronald Reagan left the White House.
<P>
But these are not dismal tidings for conservatism. The Right has impressive bench strength -- new figures without national reputations and unlikely to be presidential contenders in 2000, but effective and principled potential leaders for the future.
<P>
At the suggestion of <I>NR</I>'s editors, I have selected five conservatives to keep an eye on. Since their selection is nothing if not arbitrary, I set four arbitrary rules for picking them.
<P>
1) No household names; they must not be people widely recognized. 2) No noble losers, but rather people who win elections. 3) No moderates; bona fide conservatives only. 4) No political correctness mandating diversity (which regrettably ends up with no women on the bench).
<P>
Michigan Gov. John Engler, Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, and Missouri Sen. John Ashcroft have been around a shade too long to qualify. Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Tennessee Sen. Fred Thompson are attractive and effective, but the conservatism of each has yet to be proved. George's brother Jeb is surely conservative enough; both he and Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith would qualify had they not lost races for governor, in Florida and Indiana, respectively.
<P>
Utah Gov. Mike Leavitt, Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating, Michigan Sen. Spence Abraham, and Oklahoma Reps. Steve Largent and J. C. Watts were just nosed out by these five:
<P>
Sen. Sam Brownback of Kansas; University of California Regent Ward Connerly; California Attorney General Dan Lungren; Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania; Rep. Billy Tauzin of Louisiana.
<P>
And here is a ``junior varsity'' of promising conservatives at state and local levels:
<P>
Raleigh (N.C.) Mayor Tom Fetzer; Pennsylvania Attorney General Mike Fisher; Colorado State Treasurer Bill Owens; Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate; Illinois State Sen. Steve Rauschenberger.
<P>
<b>Sam Brownback, 40, Garnett, Kan.:</b> Thanks to Robert J. Dole's resignation, Brownback became the first of the famous House freshman class of 1994 to advance to the Senate.
<P>
The road was not easy. Kansas may have been the most consistently Republican state over the past generation, but it did not send movement conservatives to Washington -- until Sam Brownback.
<P>
A farmboy turned lawyer, Brownback served for six years as secretary of the Kansas Board of Agriculture and as a White House fellow in 1990 - 91 -- long enough to convince him the Federal Government is much too big.
<P>
His 1994 run for Congress, his first attempt at elective office, was against Democrat John Carlin, a former two-term governor. Embracing the Contract with America, Brownback won 66 per cent of the vote and carried every county in his district.
<P>
Brownback ignored Sam Rayburn's advice that House newcomers should be seldom seen and never heard. He quickly formed the New Federalists, 14 rookie Republicans dedicated to slashing government.
<P>
By the time Dole resigned from the Senate this June, Brownback had become disillusioned with House Republican leadership. He now had a shot at a Senate seat in a new kind of Senate -- with Trent Lott as Majority Leader and conservatives such as himself replacing the Doles and the Hatfields.
<P>
But first he had to face what he calls ``The Machine'' -- the Kansas Republican establishment. Gov. Bill Graves, a moderate, pro-choice Republican, filled the Dole vacancy by naming his lieutenant governor, Sheila Frahm, a dependable organization politician who is pro-choice and anti-term-limits, and who refused to sign a federal no-tax-increase pledge.
<P>
Mrs. Frahm began the primary campaign with a huge lead over Brownback. But Brownback, strongly supported by religious conservatives, tapped voters newly converted to the Republican Party and won -- easily.
<P>
Next he faced a formidable opponent with the most prestigious Democratic name in Kansas: Jill Docking, who ran as a fiscally conservative businesswoman appealing to establishment Republicans who were turned off by Brownback's support from the Religious Right.
<P>
When Mrs. Docking led in some polls, a number of political reporters were prepared to deplore the Republican folly of losing a safe seat by turning to an extremist. But Brownback won -- again, easily. Kansas has its first bona fide conservative senator in four decades.
<P>
<b>Ward Connerly, 57, Sacramento, Calif.:</b> Connerly is in a different category from the others. Although he is undoubtedly a Republican and a conservative, whether he will be a national leader is a matter of considerable doubt.
<P>
The doubt does not stem from Connerly's appeal. This black businessman awed conservatives with his courage and eloquence in leading the fight for the California Civil Rights Initiative. The question is whether, having experienced the rancid swamps of politics, he wants to get in any deeper.
<P>
Connerly, born in rural poverty in Louisiana, became a Republican 28 years ago. He was working for the California state housing department when he was lured away to become chief consultant to a new State Assembly Committee on Urban Affairs by its chairman, a liberal Republican named Pete Wilson.
<P>
Following Wilson's advice, Connerly later went into the private sector to forge a successful career as a land consultant. He declined a full-time position in Gov. Wilson's administration, but he did accept a 12-year term as a University of California Regent.
<P>
From that normally obscure base, he led the way in rolling back race and gender preferences in the giant university system. Next came his leadership in the turbulent battle for passage of CCRI. In its course, he was vilified by black leaders (one advertisement depicted him as a robed Klansman) and given the cold shoulder by corporate leaders fearful of upsetting the status quo.
<P>
That experience has led Connerly to reject appeals to run against liberal Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer next election, and indeed to say he will never again enter the political arena. But he is expected to continue his fight for an even playing field.
<p>
<B>Daniel E. Lungren, 49, Sacramento, Calif.:</B> Articulate, handsome, Catholic, a proven vote-getter, and a native Californian, Lungren is a presidential candidate of the future -- but only if elected governor in 1998. That would mark the fifth straight successful Republican campaign for governor, but the first time an arguably legitimate conservative had been elected since 1970.
<P>
Lungren is pro-life, a supply-sider, and tough on crime and immigration. His position in the California GOP was underlined at the party's platform-committee proceedings in San Diego last summer. While Lungren was inside drafting a socially conservative platform, Pete Wilson was outside in a press conference denouncing it.
<P>
Lungren spent five terms (1979 - 88) in Congress, where he became a leader on crime and immigration legislation. So well was he regarded by former colleagues that he was pushed by Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey to be Dole's running-mate.
<P>
He had joined with Gingrich to form the ``Conservative Opportunity Society,'' and was among those who sought to oust Bob Michel as Republican minority leader in 1980. But by 1984, Michel had tapped him to manage the Republican anti-crime legislation.
<P>
Lungren left Congress in 1988 to accept appointment as state treasurer but was rejected by the Democratic-controlled State Senate. However, in 1990 he was elected state attorney general, and he was re-elected in 1994 with a 4.4-million-vote landslide.
<P>
<b>Rick Santorum, 38, Pittsburgh, Pa.:</b> He is the first genuinely conservative Republican senator from Pennsylvania in half a century and a rising star in the Senate. At a time of Republican - conservative decline in the Northeast, Santorum swims against the tide.
<P>
After four years with a law firm in Pittsburgh, this second-generation Italian - American ran for Congress in 1990 against a seven-term Democrat. Santorum was outspent nearly 3 to 1, but knocked on 25,000 doors promising reform and change. He barely won.
<P>
He was one of the ``Gang of Seven'' freshman Republicans who exposed the House Bank scandal -- a foundation of the 1994 GOP takeover of the House. But by that time Santorum was running for the Senate against Sen. Harris Wofford, the national Democratic poster boy after his 1991 upset win.
<P>
Santorum, strongly supported by religious conservatives, did everything a candidate is not supposed to do in the Northeast. He was pro-life, challenged Wofford on health care, and opposed gun control. He barely won.
<P>
Once in the Senate as its youngest member, he did not hold his tongue. On the Balanced Budget Amendment, he challenged the venerable Sen. Robert Byrd in floor debate, and he called for Sen. Mark Hatfield to step down as chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee after Hatfield cast the decisive vote against the amendment.
<P>
Asked in early 1995 to name the most outstanding new GOP senators, Trent Lott mentioned Santorum first. Now, Santorum is a trusted personal lieutenant of the new Majority Leader in the new activist Senate.
<P>
<b>W. J. (Billy) Tauzin, 53, Thibodaux, La.:</b> A House member for 16 years, he is an infant in Republican years. He began the 104th Congress saying he would stay a Democrat ``for now,'' but that did not turn out to be too long. His walk across the aisle was signaled when he subscribed to all ten items in the Contract with America.
<P>
As a Democrat, he fought for private-property rights, with demands for compensation of citizens deprived of their property by government action. That often put him on a collision course with the imperious House Commerce Committee chairman, John Dingell.
<P>
Tauzin was elected to Congress nine times as a Democrat, closely allied with Louisiana's notorious former governor, Edwin Edwards. Yet last summer, he was selected to deliver the keynote address to the GOP platform committee by its chairman, Rep. Henry Hyde. Concerned by reports that the platform writers were getting wobbly, Tauzin urged the committee to hold firm.
<P>
He had been expected to run for the Senate in 1996 but stayed in the House instead, earning his tenth term without opposition -- the first time that has ever happened to a party-switcher. He is an integral part of the Republican inner circle, representing the migration of conservative Democrats in the Deep South to the GOP.
<P>
Now, here are five conservatives to watch at the state and local levels:
<P>
<I>Tom Fetzer, 41, Raleigh, N.C.:</I> A former staffer for Republican Gov. Jim Martin, he was the upset winner in the 1993 non-partisan elections in a city considered a Democratic bastion. As mayor, he has cut taxes and personnel.
<P> 
<I>Mike Fisher, 52, Pittsburgh, Pa.:</I> A veteran state legislator, Fisher bucked the 1996 Clinton tide in Pennsylvania to eke out a victory for attorney general. A law-and-order conservative, he owes his victory to support from religious conservatives assailed by the state's senior senator, Republican Arlen Specter.

<H2>The California Marijuana Vote</H2></CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, NOVEMBER 15<br>







The vote in California (forgetting, for the moment, the startling vote in Arizona) on the marijuana question mobilizes opponents on divers grounds. 
<P>
Proposition 215, voted in by a heavy majority (56 per cent), imposes new laws respecting marijuana. It is probably unsafe to say that the law was ``designed'' to make marijuana available to sick people whose doctors recommended it as a tranquilizer or stomach settler, or whatever. Unsafe, because it is entirely possible that something else was intended by the voters, namely general judicial relief. Proposition 215 is as indefinite in the authority given to doctors to authorize marijuana as <I>Roe</I> v. <I>Wade</I> turned out to be to doctors who recommend abortion ``for the safety of the mother.''
<P>
Dazed opponents of 215 are prepared to fight on several fronts. The excitable California attorney general, Dan Lungren, has sent out the word that 215 is to be interpreted very strictly as something a doctor has to recommend on a case-by-case basis. Some opponents are citing federal laws. There is one such against the use of marijuana, and no doubt there will be a legal battle over the question. If so, we will hear from the solicitor general that although individual states may decide whether the sale of alcohol is legal, the Federal Government exercises preemptive rights when marijuana is at issue.
<P>
The California Medical Association has received 215 as a mandate to the National Institutes of Health to grow up. Many California voters were presumably soured into voting Yes by the notorious decision of the NIH a year or so ago to refuse to conduct studies on the medical value of smoked marijuana on the grounds that to do so would require experimentation on live people. Such was the reasoning, up until not so long ago, of some theologians, who stood in the way of men seeking to ascertain whether they were fertile on the grounds that to produce examinable semen would require masturbation. In fact, likely findings from the NIH could hardly confute the direct evidence of hundreds of witnesses to the effectiveness of marijuana in certain circumstances as a palliative. The Food and Drug Administration approved the active ingredient in marijuana (THC) years ago, to counteract the wasting effect of cancer. ``But,'' the <I>Orange County Register</I> reminds us, ``it's legally available only in pill form, which is criticized as expensive and of little help to patients too nauseated to swallow.'' It isn't likely that any judge in California will find means of freezing Proposition 215 until the NIH comes in with its finding. 
<P>
Mourners over the success of 215 point out that opponents were vastly outspent. Yes, but we are talking nickels and dimes. Supporters of the reform raised $1.8 million, which in California politics is barely enough to squeeze in your middle initial. Opponents spent $28,000. But the plebiscite was noticed primarily by attention given to it in editorial and news coverage. You don't need a lot of paid time to advertise a conclusion a) that people who are sick and are helped by marijuana should be free to take it; and b) (if only indirectly) that it is time to say no to the Narcs who want to arrest and imprison anyone who uses the stuff.
<P> 
It was so also in Arizona, where Proposition 200, the Drug Medicalization, Prevention, and Control Act, won 65 per cent of the vote. It says that Arizona's doctors can prescribe marijuana, heroin, and LSD for patients when there is ``medicinal value.'' The proposition goes further, giving grounds to free some thousand prisoners provided that their only crime was drug possession. It eliminates criminal penalties for first-timers caught with small amounts of drugs, so long as they were not involved in violence (simultaneously, Proposition 200 stiffened penalties for violent crimes done under the influence of drugs).
<P>
At moments like this one really has to cheer the federal system. Ten years from now one should have the data with which soberly to assess the difference between life and health and justice in California under the new law and, say, New York under the old law. It is vital for those who welcome Proposition 215 to bear in mind that effectively eliminating the legal penalty against nonchalant pot is no reason to abandon educational warnings against its use, and medical warnings against its abuse.

Of course there's a mandate from the election, all the poohbahs of punditry tell us: for campaign-finance reform. There are just a couple of problems with this notion. 1) Voters don't care about finance reform, as they proved once again by handily re-electing Sen. Mitchell McConnell (R., Ky.), who regularly kills reform bills (and is promising to do so again this year). 2) The Democratic National Committee shenanigans that sparked the latest calls for reform are <I>already</I> illegal. What advocates of reform like Bill Bradley and the <I>New York Times</I> really want is a stifled public debate in which their voices will have less competition from grubby special interests like, say, small businesses, homeowners, political parties, etc. Their favorite vehicle is the bi-partisan McCain - Feingold bill, which would ban PACs, eliminate issues advocacy (e.g., Christian Coalition voter guides), and impose ``voluntary'' spending limits on Senate campaigns. Huge chunks of the bill are plainly unconstitutional. And its effect would be to shut out ordinary citizens -- who band together in groups like the National Right to Life PAC to increase their clout -- from the political process. Senator McConnell, over to you.

An AP poll conducted between October 18 and 22 asked six questions, one of them being whether Republican actions on cutting taxes, balancing the budget, reforming welfare, and shifting power from Washington to the states had gone too far, struck the right balance, or not gone far enough. Responses were as follows: 24 per cent, gone too far; 15 per cent, struck the right balance; 46 per cent, not gone far enough. In the AP summary report, the results of this question alone were (predictably?) excluded.

New Hampshire, the Granite State, has long been, well, a rock and a stronghold of a certain kind of conservatism, and so, on election night, the question was widely asked, ``What is happening to New Hampshire?'' For the first time in a quarter-century a Democrat, Jeanne Shaheen, had won the governorship, and a Democrat, Dick Swett, was erroneously projected by the TV networks as upsetting incumbent Republican conservative Sen. Bob Smith. In fact, Smith won, and New Hampshire retains two conservative senators (Smith and Judd Gregg) and two conservative representatives (Charles Bass and John Sununu Jr.). Yes, Clinton beat Dole. But Dole has never, ever won in New Hampshire. He had lost primaries to Reagan, Bush, and even Buchanan. Then he lost to Clinton. The gubernatorial race is instructive. Jeanne Shaheen ran as a conservative, taking the ``pledge'' not to try to introduce a state income or state sales tax. New Hampshire remains conservative, with a strong libertarian streak.

When the Supreme Court, in <I>Bush</I> v. <I>Vera</I> and <I>Shaw</I> v. <I>Hunt</I>, declared racially gerrymandered congressional districts unconstitutional, Jesse Jackson screamed, ``Ethnic cleansing!'' America is so racist, went the Jackson logic, that black congressmen would lose their seats if forced to run in predominantly white districts. When Abigail Thernstrom of the Manhattan Institute dissented, liberals assailed her suggestion that we should have a color-blind society as further evidence of bigotry. Mrs. Thernstrom was vindicated on November 5, when all five black representatives who sought re-election in new, white-majority districts in the South won handily. The results are impressive, most notably in the cases of Cynthia McKinney (D., Ga.), who took 58 per cent of the vote in a district that is 35 per cent black, and Sheila Jackson Lee (D., Tex.), who took 77 per cent against multiple opponents in a 42 per cent black district. What's surprising is not that so many Americans voted for blacks, but that they voted for Democrats.
n Mr. Clinton took the leadership on a Balanced Budget Amendment, announcing that he's for it and that he's against it -- in that order, we think, but maybe the other way around.

In <I>NR</I>'s November 11 issue, Immigration and Naturalization Commissioner Doris M. Meissner denied that there was anything wrong with letting the White House use her agency to create armies of Instant Democrats in time for the presidential election, as reported by Thomas McArdle (<I>NR</I>, July 1). Meanwhile, an uncritical profile of Mrs. Meissner appeared in the <I>New York Times Magazine</I> on October 27. ``We are a society committed to equal opportunity,'' she told the <I>Times Magazine</I> reporter, ``and in 1965 we rejected national origins as a basis of immigration.'' It is significant that Mrs. Meissner would justify the disastrous 1965 Immigration Act by projecting America's domestic civil-rights struggle onto the logically quite distinct issue of immigration policy. Shakespeare's soldier famously sought ``the bubble reputation/Even in the cannon's mouth.'' But where does Mrs. Meissner propose to pursue the demon Racism -- and can America survive her fixation?

With the election past and relations with a Republican Congress ahead, President Clinton allows that the two parties are close in their ideas for reforming Medicare.

Carl Lischeske of the California Health Department was astonished to read a ``Fact Sheet'' from the U.S. Interior Department on low-level nuclear waste. It said that 98 per cent of radioactive materials needing disposal came from nuclear-power plants. In fact, the majority of nuclear waste comes from hospitals, the end product of radiation therapy. Lischeske traced the 98 per cent figure to a protest group which cited no source. He then found that the U.S. Department of Energy database on low-level waste showed that less than a third of wastes are from nuclear utilities. He wrote the U.S. Interior Department: ``Rather than accepting information provided by anti-nuclear activists without question you may want to consider utilizing instead the information services provided by the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission . . .'' No answer yet. It's a new resource-use program: recycling Green propaganda.

<P>

The President further allows that there are no big differences between the parties on such issues as the environment, education, and welfare. Fine. It's about time the Democrats pitched in and did their share of poisoning the land and sea, trampling women's reproductive rights, throwing welfare moms into the gutter, and making starving schoolchildren memorize the multiplication tables.

The great power-line debate is over. The National Academy of Sciences has released a report on a review of 500 studies done over the last 17 years; the report concluded that there is no evidence that power lines, or electromagnetic fields, cause cancer. A 1979 study indicating a link between childhood leukemia and power lines launched the debate; in the early 1990s <I>New Yorker</I> author Paul Brodeur whipped up a public frenzy which resulted in million-dollar reconfigurations of power lines, lawsuits against cellular-phone companies, and a moralistic film comedy on the subject by Eddie Murphy. But sacred cows die hard, and doomsayers have now pinned their hopes on power surges. While scientific evidence does indicate a marginal correlation between childhood leukemia and proximity to power lines, the causes for this could be as diverse as traffic levels near power lines, older houses near power lines, less affluent families near power lines, and so on. But exhaustive research has concluded that the one thing that does not cause cancer near power lines is power lines.

<FONT SIZE=+3>W</FONT><font size=+1>HAT</font> more can be said about a campaign which, in its waning days, had Ross Perot calling it ``weird and inconsequential'' and its own candidate going negative, finally, but against the voters? ``Wake up, America!'' said Dole, adding a characteristic twist to Reagan's 1984 ``Morning in America'' theme. Asked what went wrong, a former RNC official sighs. ``It's kind of like asking when your dad dies of cancer, which cigarette did it? Bury the body and move on.''
<P>
OK, but not before piling on a few more shovelsful of dirt. Plenty of Republicans blame Dole for digging his own grave. He treated his nomination like a gold watch given by the company on his retirement. Even the most gifted staff would have had a tough time selling a candidate who spoke in Dole's trademark ``telegraphic'' style, and who blurted out remarks his aides had made to him about NAACP ``set-ups'' and ``wedge issues.'' And of course an incumbent presiding over a nation at peace and with a tolerable economy was likely to win re-election. But neither uncontrollable circumstances nor Dole's (well-known) weaknesses as a candidate should obscure the fact that this campaign was the most abysmal one Republicans have mounted in modern times. It was worse even than Bush - Quayle '92, which most observers would not have thought possible.
<P>
President Clinton's re-election team was sophisticated, coordinated, and aggressive. Dole's staff matched them in cynicism but little else. <I>Their</I> aggression was chiefly directed at each other. Mike Murphy, who was dismissed in September as Dole's media consultant, later wrote that distrust and secrecy made the campaign ``like the Kremlin.'' Former staffers and hangers-on paint a similar picture. ``There are departments that don't speak to other departments,'' said one. ``The press shop won't speak to the rapid-response shop. . . . People are too turf-conscious.'' Campaign manager Scott Reed exacerbated the problem by running the campaign like Jeremy Bentham's Panopticon: he knew what each department was doing but they couldn't follow each other.
<P>
It's not surprising, then, that staffers would air their internal strategic disputes in public. For two weeks the campaign debated whether to attack Clinton's character, using the <I>Washington Post</I>'s front page as an intermediary. This was of a piece with the campaign's general leakiness, which tended to undercut campaign tactics. Putting Billy Dale in the front row of the audience for the first presidential debate was a clever touch, for example, but it would have been more clever if Clinton hadn't been warned of it in the newspaper the day before. Other leaks demonstrated staffers' disloyalty. The week of the election, <I>The New Yorker</I>'s Michael Kelly quoted Reed as absolving himself from any responsibility for the coming defeat. (Reed's lame defense of his remarks: ``The piece was supposed to be written after the election.'')
<P>
The campaign's rocky press relations caused other problems too. The campaign, particularly John Buckley's communications operation, was obsessed with getting good coverage in the elite media (the networks, the <I>Post</I>, the <I>New York Times</I>). Previous, successful Republican campaigns had gone around the establishment media, appealing directly to the American people and exploiting alternative media outlets. Dole's campaign did neither. It avoided talk radio, much to the consternation of the Republican National Committee. In order not to offend elite-media sensibilities, the campaign, in effect, internalized the media's standards.
<P>
So, the San Diego convention was designed to prevent the media from being able to repeat their demonization of the 1992 Houston convention. It was soft and fuzzy, like cotton candy, and the ``bounce'' it generated melted just as quickly. Or take the first presidential debate. The talking heads said Dole had to show that he wasn't mean and that he had mastered the complexities of public policy. So he did both, having been coached on the latter by Sheila Burke, and the pundits patted him on the head for being a graceful loser.
<P>
If the campaign overemphasized media reactions, it was obsessed with polls. Nobody questions the competence of campaign pollster Tony Fabrizio or the accuracy of his findings; those findings just weren't translated into practical advice. Pollster Kellyanne Fitzpatrick criticizes ``the use of focus groups and polls as a source to base Dole's convictions rather than a tool to develop strategy. You've got to <I>move</I> polls, not just measure them.'' The fixations on polls and the press combined to make Dole hesitant to ``go negative.'' Yet a successful campaign had to be ``negative,'' i.e., to persuade voters to fire the incumbent. Voters don't like negativity, but attacks stick in their minds and affect their decisions. Clinton started his anti-Dole ads early, got the message to stick, and was able to end his campaign on a positive note. When the Dole campaign finally started attacking Clinton it was too late, and what stuck in voters' minds was the negativity.
<P>
Meanwhile, the campaign bounced from tax cuts to drugs to tax cuts to school choice to character to . . . whatever. From the voters' perspective, it was all so much white noise. The campaign displayed a pathological aversion to staying on message. It never even ran a decent ad on the 15 per cent tax cut which was its supposed centerpiece. Dole muddled other messages. When he proposed a modest set of political reforms to highlight the Indogate scandal, for instance, he reinforced the Democrats' line that the problem was current law, not Clinton's failure to abide by it. In indicting the political system in general, he implicitly excused Clinton in particular. Dole's ``better man for a better America'' slogan was never given political content; like Bush before him, Dole clung to the hope that the public would prefer him as a person to Clinton.
<P>
Dole's worst strategic mistake was to heed Richard Nixon's advice to run right in the primaries and then run to the center for the general election. Dole alienated social conservatives and gun-rights supporters and took other conservatives for granted. He distanced himself from the supposedly ``extremist'' Republican Congress, even though congressional candidates, the Congress as a whole, and the party were always more popular than Dole. At a gathering of Washington conservatives this summer, Fabrizio, acting as the campaign's emissary, brusquely dismissed their complaints with the explanation that they didn't have anywhere else to go. He said they should go along with Dole the way the gay lobby was putting up with Clinton's political infidelities.
<P>
Nixon's proposed strategy -- which, by the way didn't really describe his own m.o. -- presupposed the other candidate's total unacceptability to conservatives. As the exit polls show, that wasn't the case with Clinton. The strategy also poisoned the campaign's relations with Congress. They never were good: House Majority Leader Dick Armey had trouble getting calls returned. But Dole's abandonment of congressional Republicans on the assault-weapons issue was the last straw. They abandoned him by sending Clinton bills he could sign and for which all incumbents could take credit. Dole staffers' bitter complaints about the ``betrayal,'' particularly on welfare, fell on deaf ears. Republicans, in short, did not run as a team, as they had in 1994. The Dole campaign viewed outsiders -- even, at times, the RNC -- as threats rather than resources.
<P>
The campaign's second worst strategic mistake was the neglect of social, moral, and cultural issues. The California Civil Rights Initiative was held at arm's length, then embraced at a point when Dole could only drag it down. Partial-birth abortion was addressed sporadically. ``I wish that we had gone to Notre Dame and given a major speech on partial-birth abortion and made a major play for the Catholic vote,'' says speechwriter Mike Gerson. Drug use was the only social issue Dole dwelt on, and it's the sort of consensus issue that doesn't move many votes. Peter Roff, political director of GOPAC, says, ``They decided to run a campaign based largely on economics, which was an interesting experiment and we now see it didn't work.''
<P>
The list of legitimate criticisms of the campaign is practically inexhaustible. Dole addressed the gender gap by touting his support for the Violence Against Women Act and visiting a shelter for battered women. The campaign didn't court Reagan Democrats. Various states were written off and then put back in play. There was never any follow-through on dramatic events like Dole's resignation from the Senate. In retrospect, the vice-presidential selection was also a mistake. Dole should have picked someone who could deliver a swing state and help with a swing demographic group, someone with a track record of winning votes. A Midwestern Catholic governor like John Engler of Michigan would have met all those tests; Jack Kemp met none of them. As a final indignity, Dole closed the campaign alongside Gerald Ford and George Bush -- forming a trio with an impressive seven failed White House bids.
<P> 
Can anything be salvaged from all the self-serving leaks, back-biting, and embarrassments of this campaign? If it results in a reform of the primary process that led to Dole's nomination, some good will have come of it. One conservative activist in Washington proposes another reform. Referring to Dole -  Kemp HQ, he says, ``Nobody who walked into 810 First Street should ever work for Republicans again.''

<H2>On Needed Extremism</H2></CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, NOVEMBER 8<br>


A very bright professor, on Wednesday, trying to give cheer to his despondent companion, summed it up in this way: ``Look. The guy who was elected President is a Republican Democrat. He got 49 per cent of the vote. He was running against a Republican Republican, who won 41 per cent of the vote. The third candidate was a conservative with 8 per cent. The House stayed Republican by about 19 seats, with 80 per cent of the 1994 freshman Republicans winning re-election. The Senate stayed Republican by 10 seats, and the majority of governors are Republican. So what's the gloom all about?''
<P>
Nicely done, if conservative uplift is the order of the day. But the air seemed saturated, on D-Day+1, with strains of the old melody: The middle road. One commentator said it bluntly: The Lord has spoken, and what we have seen is a repudiation of extremists, of both the Left and the Right. The way of the future is down the middle of the road. 
<P>
The Lord wasn't all that plainspoken, some of us conclude. Bob Dornan of California -- ``B-1 Bob,'' as his dazzled critics think of him -- is hanging in there, with a tiny lead. Strom Thurmond, at the end of his freshly renewed term, will be one hundred years old. And Jesse Helms had his customary victory. On the far Left, Mr. Bonior of Michigan squeaked through, as did several members of the Establishment Left like Charles Rangel, who was quoted as saying he intended to be buried in Chicago, so that he could continue an active political career posthumously. 
<P>
We are left, of course, with the question: How do you define an extremist? The thesaurus gives fanatic as a synonym, and the <I>American Heritage Dictionary</I> contributes a Usage Note: ``synonyms: <I>fanatic</I>, <I>zealot</I>, <I>enthusiast</I>. These nouns denote persons who are ardently and usually excessively devoted to a particular cause, subject, or activity. <I>Fanatic</I> implies the pursuit of a given interest to inordinate and even irrational lengths, often to the exclusion of all other interests: <I>'A fanatic is one who can't change his mind and won't change the subject'</I> (Winston S. Churchill). A <I>zealot</I> is immoderately devoted to a cause or goal and seeks to advance it with passionate fervor: <I>'those furious zealots who blow the bellows of faction until the whole furnace of politics is red-hot'</I> (Washington Irving). <I>Enthusiast</I> can denote a religious zealot holding visionary opinions. More commonly, however, it merely implies strong interest in something such as a hobby, and lacks the unfavorable connotations of the other terms: <I>"a hockey enthusiast"</I>.
<P>
We see, then, that the term <I>extremist</I> can readily be used to stigmatize a position different from one's own. The professional politicians still reel from the pronouncement by Barry Goldwater in 1964 that moderation in pursuit of justice is no virtue, extremism in defense of liberty is no vice. You get an absolute and plausible consensus on extremism only when it is used to designate riflemen who wander about (in isolated numbers) mumbling about the need to take the law into their own hands. Extremism can be used, and has been, to denounce people who kill without judicial authority, as also those who execute in state prisons. There is a difference, and that difference teaches us to use words with caution. And the beginning of wisdom here is to decline to retreat from a desired political objective simply because it is anathematized as extremist by True Believers, or opportunists. 
<P>
The most prominent of the issues in question is of course abortion. Although the great majority coast in and out of the polling booth unaffected by the issue, abortion is as divisive as any question in the public square. What surely is needed is the rejection of the finding in <I>Roe</I> v. <I>Wade</I>, to the effect that the right to abort is fundamental and constitutionally given. This space is not given over to the one-millionth consideration of the opinion of the majority, rather to a legitimate objective of the GOP, which should not be denounced as extremist. It is to return the authority to govern abortions to the states. We already know (Connecticut is an example) that there are states anxious to write into their laws guarantees of abortion rights. The quarrels then would be inside marginal states, easing away the question as a national issue. 
<P>
The GOP leadership should frame a new and non-extremist position: We abandon the goal of constitutional reform, you abandon opposition to ditching <I>Roe</I> v. <I>Wade</I>.

Is it me, or did we win? 
<P>
I'm not trying to be huffy here, but we did win, right? I mean, I guess my question is, if we won, then why do we need to have quite so many discussions about ``reaching out'' to Colin Powell and ``building bridges'' with Dick Gephardt?
<P>
In the first place, I'm not sure why we're making so many changes in the Administration. Forgive me, but I think the one we had was pretty darn good. Donna Shalala was a killer over at HHS; Henry Cisneros did a bang-up job at HUD; and Warren Christopher was one of the best Secretaries of State we've had, considering his age and the fact that he has no presidential ambition. 
<P>
Americans voted for the status quo. Why in heaven's name aren't we giving it to them? 
<P>
If I sound angry, Rusty, it's because I am. The Gore family is knocking itself out trying to prepare for the next election. For the next three years, the girls have promised to stay away from creepy boyfriends and avoid big desserts; and little Al, bless his heart, is taking up soccer. ``Now you're a soccer mom!'' he shouted with glee, and Tipper promised to drive him to every game from September 1999 to November 2000 and to publicly complain about her ``crazy schedule.'' Karenna thinks she may be ready to get married, so we're on the lookout for a) a suitable groom, and b) the right Saturday in May 2000 for a Rose Garden wedding, with receptions to follow in Florida and California.
<P>
And Mom and Dad, troupers to their very last breath, have promised not to breathe it until the eve of the Democratic National Convention. 
<P>
So in the face of that all-out Gore effort, it doesn't seem like too much to ask that the rest of the Administration pitch in and lend a hand. 
<P>
That's why this Colin-Powell-as-Secretary-of-State business has me so nettled. 
<P>
``What about sweet old George Mitchell?'' I asked.
<P>
``Too partisan,'' was the reply.
<P>
``Then what about Dick Holbrooke? After all, he's not running for President.''
<P>
``Don't be too sure. He's set up an exploratory committee and a fund-raising arm called 'America Deserves Dick Holbrooke.'''
<P>
``Does he really think he's qualified to be President?'' I asked.
<P>
``No, but he's willing to stoop a little.''

With Colin Powell at State and William Weld as a possible Attorney General, I joked to Bill that he may as well get Christie Whitman in here to replace me.
<P>
``Good idea,'' he said, and reached for the phone. 
<P>
``Whoa whoa whoa,'' I said. ``What gives? We won! Let's act like winners. Maybe throw our weight around a little. Not return a few phone calls. Forget to invite Dick Gephardt to the White House Christmas Tree Lighting.'' 
<P>
``Al,'' Bill said, ``we've been through this. You know what we have to do. Look, if I were you, I wouldn't be so concerned with what goes on around here. Think of it this way: every meal you eat at home is a meal you're not eating with two thousand Buddhist monks.'' 
<P>
I thought about this long and hard. In my heart, I knew Bill was right. We do need at least one Republican around. But which one? 
<P>
That night, as we got ready for bed, I laid out the situation for Tipper. ``Tip,'' I said, ``Bill makes a pretty convincing case that if I want to be elected in four years, we've got to show some real accomplishments. And the only way we're going to accomplish anything is if we have a bipartisan Administration. But which Republicans do you think I should accept?''
<P> 
She fluffed the pillows for a second. ``Jack Kemp at HUD and Pat Buchanan at Commerce.''
<P> 
``What?'' I shouted. ``Both of those guys are planning to run in the primaries! Putting them in a Clinton Cabinet would only elevate them to front-runner status!'' 
<P>
She fluffed some more. 
<P>
``Plus,'' I went on, ``won't we look ideologically schizophrenic?'' 
<P>
She shot me a raised-eyebrow look. ``That ship,'' she said, ``has sailed.''
<P> 
``But -- '' 
<P>
``Al, if you could help two Republicans win the nomination in 2000, which would they be?''
<P> 
I thought for a second. ``Oh,'' I said. ``Gotcha.''
<P> 
It was the first good night of sleep I've had since the election. 
<P>
Gotta go. Tipper and I are pricing minivans today. Soccer moms don't use armor-plated Town Cars!

Fifty-three per cent of smokers, according to polls, voted for Bill Clinton. It's a helluva way to quit.

<P>
<hr>
<P>

Results from ballot initiatives around the country confirm the electorate's anti-government tilt. In nine states, voters approved congressional term limits; in two more the vote was too close to call at press time. Florida voters approved the toughest anti-tax initiative in the land, requiring a two-thirds vote of the people for any new tax. Nevada and South Dakota passed only slightly less stringent measures. (In Arizona, where such a super-majority law already exists, the legislature doesn't even bother to request new taxes.) Meanwhile, most of the Left's initiatives went down in flames. The trial lawyers lost their bid in California to overturn the federal law barring frivolous shareholder suits. Two separate initiatives to take over the California health-care system lost by 2 to 1. Big Green took a pounding too: a sugar tax to pay for Everglades clean-up, a ban on clear-cutting in Maine, and a bottle-tax proposal in Oregon all went down. One hopes the elected show as much common sense as the voters.

<P>
<hr>
<P>

What do these people have in common: the Republican governors, Jack Kemp, Bob Torricelli, and Charles Rangel? They are all tipped in Jude Wanniski's post-election fax as ``promising possibilities [of] optimism.'' FYI.


<P>
<hr>
<P>
Republican giddiness over the possibility of President Clinton's being hobbled by scandal, and maybe even impeached, is understandable. But congressional Republicans, while investigating the Indogate affair (and other outstanding Clinton scandals), should keep in mind a few cautionary words. First, impeaching a President should not be foreseen with glee. While President Clinton may deserve his fate, the country does not deserve the upheaval that would attend his comeuppance. Nor is it certain that Kenneth Starr will indict the First Lady or that the President will be implicated in Indogate. To assume so is escapism: let scandals take care of Clinton, then the GOP won't have to decide how to beat a slippery Democrat who foils them at every turn. The GOP can't expect Kenneth Starr to do its work for it.

<P>
<hr>
<P>

Still, the week was enlivened when John Huang, top Democratic Party fund-raiser, took it on the lam rather than answer questions. An eyewitness even saw a man of Mr. Huang's description sprinting out a back door of Democratic National Committee headquarters as U.S. marshals came in the front door with a subpoena. Hillary Rodham Clinton nonetheless managed to send a note to the fugitive saying, ``We all support Mr. Huang.'' Nobody knew where he was, but Mr. Huang received that message. It is a miracle unless -- <I>yes!</I> -- Eleanor delivered it.

<P>
<hr>
<P>

A desperate <I>New York Times</I>, trying to explain why the President's bad habits are reasons to vote for him: ``Scandals present an opportunity in the second term for Bill Clinton to get back in touch with integrity and honesty.'' Why stop there? A series of axe murders in broad daylight would be reason to scrap the Twenty-Second Amendment and keep the guy till 2004.

<P>
<hr>
<P>

As the campaign for the California Civil Rights Initiative came down the home stretch, the <I>Los Angeles Times</I> ran an article citing late writings of Martin Luther King in support of racial preferences. Charlton Heston, who had joined King's 1963 March on Washington, wrote a letter to the editor recalling that he had stood in the Senate gallery in 1964 as Hubert Humphrey argued for the Civil Rights Bill. Asked if it might lead to quotas and preferences, Humphrey vehemently denied it. ``I can't know what was in Dr. King's heart,'' Heston concluded, ``but Hubert Humphrey was a man of honor. The language of preference was not in the bill. That grew gradually over the next twenty years, under the monstrous bureaucracy that still fights to keep the injustice it has wrought.'' The <I>Times</I>, evidently pressed for space, did not run the letter.

<P>
<hr>
<P>
The White House, pulling an old soap-opera trick, claims there was another John Huang (perhaps a long-lost amnesiac twin) making all those visits to the inner circle. Nice try, but two Huangs still don't make a right.


<P>
<hr>
<P>
The Clinton Administration refused to come clean -- before the election -- on its plans for the 35,000 U.S. troops in Bosnia. They would complete their peacekeeping mission in ``about one year,'' the President promised the nation in a televised address on November 27, 1995. Now, the Administration is reportedly considering two options for an extended tour: 1) a ``withdrawal'' option, which actually involves sending 5,000 new GIs to cover the withdrawal of the 35,000 by March 1997, after which an air-assault brigade and fighter aircraft would remain nearby (``over the horizon'') indefinitely; 2) a ground-force presence, smaller than the present one, to remain in Bosnia through late 1997 and possibly beyond. Defense Secretary Perry told Congress in October that no decision has been made. But the one option not likely to be chosen is what the President originally promised. Meanwhile, as the political provisions of the Dayton Accords unravel, American training and equipping of the Bosnians is stalled -- another Clinton promise blowing in the wind. This is why the U.S. and NATO have to worry about using their troops to do what the Bosnians should be doing for themselves.

Jean-Bedel Bokassa, former self-styled Emperor of the Central African Republic, has passed on after a colorful career of murder, infanticide, and cannibalism, of a stroke, and that'll teach him to eat too many fatty political opponents.

Barbara Coe, a leader of the California Coalition for Immigration Reform and an architect of California's Proposition 187, is being threatened with legal action by the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, California's Secretary of State, the Orange County Registrar's Office, and the U.S. Department of Justice. Miss Coe's offense? ``Intimidating voters'' by posting and distributing flyers stating the law: ``Only Citizens Can Vote! Violators Will Be Prosecuted!'' Opposing election fraud is now apparently a crime in California.

Under the 1990 Hate Crime Statistics Act, the FBI classifies victims of hate crimes by race, ethnicity, religion, and sexual orientation, but identifies perpetrators only by race. Hispanics, therefore, are recognized as victims, but not as perpetrators. Since most Hispanics are officially identified as ``white,'' if a Hispanic attacks a black, it is typically counted as a white-on-black hate crime. Similarly, if a Hispanic attacks an Asian, it is a white-on-Asian hate crime. And if a Hispanic attacks a Hispanic, it is a white-on-Hispanic hate crime. No word yet on how the FBI classifies those who attack common sense, or the principle that all men are created <I>iguales</I>.

 WASHINGTON, D.C.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>A</FONT><font size=+1>T HALF</font> past nine on election night, the Dole campaign conceded defeat. ``Bob Dole has completed his last political mission with courage and honor,'' said press secretary Nelson Warfield in a press release. Half an hour later, Warfield was backtracking in another release marked ``URGENT'': ``Due to an error, a statement from the Dole campaign was prematurely released to some news outlets this evening. The fact is Bob Dole has conceded nothing.'' An hour or so later, the campaign conceded that its original concession was correct.
<P>
It was a fitting end for a campaign that rarely made a tactical move without protracted bouts of public agonizing, oftentimes only to reverse field again within a few weeks or even hours. Attack or take the ``high road''? Contest California or not? Pound home the tax-cut message or abandon it? The Dole campaign never had the same answer for long, and so it's little wonder that in the final hours it couldn't even decide whether or not it had lost. The election just couldn't end without one more Dole campaign fiasco.
<P>
It was a status-quo end to a status-quo campaign. If the Dole camp thought it may have conceded too early, other Republicans had been ready to throw in the towel months before. Dole never was able to gain a foothold against his agile opponent. The ads, initiatives, and campaign trips of the last three months did little to alter the basic shape of the race. Nor have they changed the State of the Union. The White House remains Democratic, the Congress Republican. Even the line-up of states in the Electoral College remains essentially the same as in the Bush - Clinton election of 1992. It was an incumbents' night.
<P>
The last two years have featured a continued tug-of-war over the proper role of government in American life. The liberal vision of a government growing by leaps and bounds has been, it can by now be confidently stated, firmly repudiated; but the conservative vision of a relimited government has not been fully accepted by the public. The 1996 elections were widely expected to resolve the issue for the next decade. Instead the voters left matters unsettled. Not that the candidates did much to help them decide. The Democrats all talked about their support of the balanced budget; the Republicans boasted of increasing spending on Medicare.
<P>
It was Clinton's good fortune to run for re-election in a generally satisfied country. As one would expect, those who thought the economy was ``good'' or ``excellent'' went heavily for the incumbent, while those who viewed it as ``not good'' or ``poor'' opted for the challenger. Unfortunately for Dole, there were more of the former (56 per cent) than the latter (42 per cent). Similarly, the 53 per cent of voters who think the country is headed in the right direction strongly favored Clinton while the 43 per cent who worried that it is on the wrong track broke, albeit less heavily, for Dole. 
<P>
Even if circumstances had been more propitious for a Republican presidential candidate, Bob Dole's liabilities would have made him a tough sell. In a fit of overconfidence, the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> once editorialized that any Republican who didn't drool could probably beat Bill Clinton. It turns out that voters demanded more than that, like a candidate who could complete a sentence. Not only did Dole garble his arguments and baffle his audiences with references to Beltway arcana, when he did manage to make a point he would often undercut it with self-deprecatory irony.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>N</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>O</FONT> wonder voters concluded that this difficult, remote figure didn't understand their problems or have a vision for the future: 51 per cent of voters doubted that Dole understood their problems; only 12 per cent of those who thought ``vision'' the most important quality in a candidate voted for Dole; 56 per cent of voters said Dole hadn't given them a reason to vote for him. And then there was Dole's age. Most voters (64 per cent) professed not to be concerned by Dole's age, but the minority that thought it would affect his performance gave a whopping 79 per cent of their votes to Clinton. If their votes had been excluded, Dole would have won the election.
<P>
But the most important factor was that Dole drove away the Republican base. From the outset conservatives had, at best, little enthusiasm for the senior senator from Kansas. Yet instead of trying to woo them, once the primaries were over the campaign went out of its way to offend them, seemingly confusing this accomplishment with winning over swing voters. The combination of an unattractive messenger and a misbegotten message kept Dole from taking votes that should have been his.
<P>
Thirteen per cent of the voters who selected George Bush in 1992 defected to Clinton this year. So did 20 per cent of self-identified conservatives and 26 per cent of the ``white Religious Right.'' Dole only tied among married people, and Clinton actually took a plurality of parents of minors. As for the notion -- sure to be bruited about as frequently after the election as before -- that an unpopular Congress dragged Dole down, it's worth noting that 16 per cent of voters who approved of the Republican Congress left Dole in the lurch. This shouldn't have been a surprise: during the campaign Dole consistently polled below congressional candidates, the Congress as a whole, and the Republican Party.
<P>
Other Republicans were able to appeal to the party's base and fashion winning coalitions. Phil Gramm, no ideological wallflower, ran 6 points ahead of Dole in Texas. Conservative Tim Hutchinson was able to win election to the Senate in President Clinton's home turf of Arkansas, running 15 points ahead of Dole. A number of Senate candidates who lost probably would have won without the Dole drag. Dole lost Louisiana by 13 points; Woody Jenkins lost the chance to become the Senate's most conservative member in a squeaker.
<P>
Indeed, Dole probably hurt his side more than Clinton helped his. The crowning victory of Clinton's career is hardly a resounding affirmation of his Presidency. He is the first President since Woodrow Wilson to win two consecutive elections with a minority of the vote. Most Americans continue to harbor serious reservations about the President's character: 52 per cent said they were ``concerned'' or ``scared'' about the prospect of a Clinton victory; 54 per cent consider him untrustworthy or dishonest; 59 per cent doubt that he has told the truth about Whitewater. Dole won heavily among the minority of voters who listed a candidate's ``character'' as more important than his stands on issues. Despite Clinton's constant calls for national unity, he is a deeply divisive figure: most of the people who voted for him think he tells the truth, but an incredible 91 per cent of Dole supporters put him in the ``dishonest/untrustworthy'' category. A smaller slice of voters (18 per cent), which might be dubbed the ``character swing vote,'' voted for Clinton despite their distrust.
<P>
Given these ambivalent attitudes toward Clinton it's not surprising that no Democratic sweep materialized despite Clinton's Electoral College sweep. This year saw no partisan tide for the Democrats of the kind that brought Republicans to power in Congress in 1994, no public yearning for a return to a united and purposeful Democratic government. Crucial in stemming any nationwide Democratic resurgence in the campaign's final days were ads bought by the National Republican Campaign Committee warning of the dangers of a ``blank check'' for President Clinton that would allow him to return to his tax-and-spend ways. Republican candidates took similar tacks in their individual races, tagging their opponents as ``liberals'' and trying to associate them with the Democratic majorities of old.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>T</FONT> was really a two-pronged effort. As Republican candidates hardened the perception of their opponents' ideological edges they sought to soften their own. Even an aggressive conservative like Tim Hutchinson spoke proudly of his vote for the minimum wage. The universal refrain of Republicans from coast to coast was that they had <I>increased</I> spending for education, for student loans, for environmental programs, and of course, for school lunches. Leader of the revolution Newt Gingrich demonstrated the method himself when he cut an ad attacking his opponent, cookie maker Michael Coles, for paying some workers only the minimum wage. (Make that the cookie monster.)
<P>
Democrats hoped, of course, to make Gingrich the focus of every race in the country. That strategy clearly failed. The public's hostility to Gingrich is personal, not ideological. Republicans could thus inoculate themselves from the charge of being Gingrich clones simply by convincing voters that they were nice guys with the best interests of their districts at heart; they didn't have to dissociate themselves from the substance of the Republican revolution. In only one House race did the nuke-Newt strategy clearly draw blood: the surprisingly tough run liberal Republican Nancy Johnson had in her usually safe Connecticut district. At press time Rep. Johnson's race is still in doubt. Shocks like that happen when the party's presidential candidate loses a state by 16 points, but a crucial factor in Mrs. Johnson's race was the hits she took for allegedly covering for Gingrich in her capacity as chairman of the House Ethics Committee. The ethics charges against Gingrich may yet hurt other Republicans in coming months, but for now it is far more significant that he was the architect of Congress's rise to its highest approval ratings in ten years.
<P>
Also a flop was the labor-union charge against Republican freshmen. Only 14 (out of 73) were defeated. A couple of factors were at work. First, all the Democrats' spending a year ago did help ``burn in'' the impression that Republicans were an intemperate majority willing to embrace ``extremist'' means -- i.e., shutting down the government -- to achieve the ends of special interests. The Medicare issue also was effective against some Republicans (although Clinton actually did worse among seniors than in 1992). In the end it seems the labor unions overreached; they ran their ads so early and many of them were so ham-handed that by the stretch run they had lost their force. The special $35 million in forced union dues spent to elect a Democratic Congress works out to $2.5 million per defeated Republican freshman, some of whom would have lost even if the unions had left every dime in the bank. The morning after the election, GOP pollster Kellyanne Fitzpatrick remarked that a CEO who made an investment like that would be fired.
<P>
In the run-up to the elections, ``union bosses'' had to compete for news coverage with ``soccer moms.'' The oft-discussed gender gap was real and harmful to Dole and other Republicans. If men were the only ones who had voted, Republicans would probably be striding toward a veto-proof majority in the Senate: Lightfoot and Harkin tied among men, Woody Jenkins narrowly beat Mary Landrieu among men. The ultimate causes of the gender gap are unclear, and Republicans are sure to argue over it in coming months. In a pre-election interview Republican analyst Jim Pinkerton lamented ``the horrible gender-gap problem that, excuse me, the pro-life issue gives Republicans. I'm sure you're not going to print that but it's true.'' That's sure to be the conventional wisdom we'll hear for weeks. Yet the Massachusetts Senate race provides evidence against that contention. Republican Gov. William Weld is an impeccable social liberal -- he even sided with Clinton's decision to keep partial-birth abortion legal -- and he still trailed among women by 21 points while tying among men. 
<P>
If Republicans are from Mars, Democrats are from Venus. Dole's margin among suburban dads was twice as high as Clinton's margin among suburban moms. And the Democrats do not have quite the hold on women they might hope. The President, whose way with women has been the focus of extravagant praise from the press, got slightly less of the women's vote than Reagan did in 1984. And quite a few Republicans had no particular trouble appealing to women. New Arkansas Sen. Tim Hutchinson, a principled conservative but a soothing personality, tied among women in Arkansas. Even Phil Gramm, a not-so-soothing personality, won among all women by 9 points and among white women by 30 points, after running a hard-hitting, issue-driven campaign in the Lone Star State. 
<P>
The magic bullet that was supposed to get Dole out of all his troubles, with women and everyone else, was his 15 per cent tax plan. It was a well-crafted proposal that should have been politically appealing; under the plan a couple making $35,000 a year with two children would have seen their tax burden reduced by <I>one-third</I> (a datum that the Dole campaign didn't push nearly hard enough). Deficit-phobia wasn't the problem: 58 per cent of voters recognized that it is possible to cut taxes <I>and</I> the deficit. But two-thirds of voters didn't think <I>Dole</I> could do both. To voters his about-face on tax cuts seemed (like so much of his campaign) a matter of mere expedience.
In retrospect, if Dole was going to ignore his political instincts and pick a conservative theme to make the centerpiece of his campaign, that theme should have come out of the cluster of social and cultural issues. Exhibit number one is the California Civil Rights Initiative, banning race and gender preferences by government entities in California. All year long, CCRI outran Dole. Its momentum withstood a vicious late blitz of demagogic attacks and outright lies. The Dole campaign eschewed the issue for fear of alienating those soccer moms (soccer is a multi-cultural game, after all). But early exit polls indicate that CCRI won 51 per cent of the women's vote, a performance of which Bob Dole could only dream.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>W</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>HAT</FONT> does this mean for the next two years? The Senate will be marginally more Republican and appreciably more conservative. Liberal-to-moderate Republicans Mark Hatfield (Ore.), Nancy Landon Kassebaum (Kan.), Alan Simpson (Wyo.), and, of course, Bob Dole are all out the door. Replacing them is a freshman class of Republicans that will move the body to the right in philosophy and attitude: Sam Brownback (Kan.), Tim Hutchinson (Ark.), Mike Enzi (Wyo.), Wayne Allard (Colo.), and Jeff Sessions (Ala.). Instead of being slowed down by the Senate, House Republicans could find themselves straining to keep up.
<P>
Gingrich himself, of course, will start from a position of diminished power. Many members have had to dodge bullets with Gingrich's name on them and will be less willing to follow his lead than two years ago, and committee chairmen were already getting restive in the waning days of the last Congress. Gingrich is likely to be eager to embrace an aggressive bi-partisanship to win media goodwill. Indeed, the White House spin, adopted by the major media, is that the election results were a mandate for co-operation in Washington, for getting things done. House members who saw their early poor poll results turn around after they passed the minimum wage, welfare reform, and health regulation will be especially susceptible to this interpretation.
<P>
But voters <I>never</I> favor partisan confrontation; they don't want ``gridlock.'' And yet, they prefer some policies to others, and a majority prefer Republican policies. The fact that a majority of voters voted against Clinton should register with savvy Republicans even if the news doesn't reach the press. Republicans needn't accept whatever Clinton throws at them. On tax cuts, for instance, it's not at all clear that Clinton's tiny, targeted tax credits have won a mandate over broader tax relief. And Republicans should take heed of the fact that it was cleverly packaged partisan confrontation, over issues of Clinton's choosing, that paved the way for his comeback.
<P>
Measured against what might have been, the Republican showing on November 5 was disappointing: two years ago they thought they ruled the world and laughed at the possibility of a second Clinton term. They shouldn't have. But there are signs that the secular trend is still toward increased Republican dominance of American politics. Economic conditions fluctuate, and so does the quality of candidates and campaigns. If those factors had been different this year, Republicans would probably have had another sweep like 1994's. So, while the Dole campaign lost long before 9:30 P.M. on November 5, it's still too early for Republicans with designs on a historic realignment to concede defeat.

<H2>What to Do About the Expatriate?</H2></CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, OCTOBER 22<br>
The question, from a member of the Democratic panel, was intended as hostile. What did we Republicans think of American citizens who, in order to save taxes, give up their citizenship?
<P>
I answered to the effect that protest against taxation is a venerable American habit, thought to be axiomatic by those of our ancestors who emptied a boat laden with tea into Boston Harbor. 
<P>
Well, what did we think of the proposal to bar such expatriates from living here for more than four months every year? 
<P>
That question sends us back to the thought-library. When is expatriation commendable? 
<P>
We begin by acknowledging that all Americans are the fruit of expatriation. We have never cultivated harsh thoughts for those who left England or Holland in search of greater religious freedom than they had at home. Certainly we do not resent those who came to America fleeing persecution. And, on reflection, we do not resent those who came here looking for commercial opportunity, do we? If Andrew Carnegie left Scotland intending nothing more than to make a fortune in the New World, what is the proper attitude of the Scots he abandoned?
<P>
During and after the Revolutionary War there was some resentment of the ``loyalists'' who went to Canada. But the bitterness was not long lasting, and it isn't hard to understand that there should have been those for whom the tug of loyalty to the Crown transcended contemporary revolutionary ardor. The Southerner who abandoned his ``country'' (there were very few) because he did not wish to identify himself with a war the apparent purpose of which was to establish the South's right to continue to allow slavery would not, in retrospect, be thought cowardly, or disloyal, though his timing was questionable.
<P>
What about the rich American who gives up his flag in order to shield himself from taxation? 
<P>
The spastic answer is that of course such a man is to be despised. But it's also true, isn't it, that we are, as Americans, tolerant of deviant behavior? The most engaging recent example of expatriate canniness is the man who gave up his citizenship, pulled out his money, went off to live in some little island country, and persuaded the government to appoint him Ambassador to the United States. A really nifty arrangement, because now he has rejoined his family and lives in his native land, tax free. Somebody somewhere got in the way of that little maneuver, and now the question raised in Congress is how far to limit expatriates' visits to the United States. After 182 days, you become a U.S. resident for purposes of taxation; so that anyone primarily engaged in evading taxes would not expect to live more than six months a year here. But there is sentiment in Congress for limiting this time further, even drastically.
<P>
One seeks perspective. Sure, anybody ought to have the right to go anywhere to take up residence, subject of course to the right of every country to regulate immigration. The question we are considering is whether the man who undertakes alienation in order to protect his property is beneath contempt. 
<P>
Certainly that would be so if such a person left his country when it was in distress. We have read of Germans who thought it disloyal to leave when Hitler assumed power, on the grounds that their duty now was to unseat Hitler. Others, despairing of this possibility, fled to protect themselves and family. 
<P>
An American who left the country in wartime can properly be thought of as a deserter. But what about an American who decides that the property he has accumulated he wishes to retain for himself and his family? How heavily should he be punished? Should we allow him only thirty days in his ex-country? Three days? No days? 
<P>
Loyalty has always got to be contingent. The current issue of <I>First Things</I> publishes five deeply philosophical essays wondering whether loyalty has been forfeited to a government whose judiciary arrogates authority over life and death, as the Supreme Court has done in the matter of abortions, and threatens to do on euthanasia. A belief in equal treatment under the law is not frivolous; and the citizen made to pay at class-warfare rates, current or prospective, can presumably be thought of as an Andrew Carnegie in reverse. We must remember what Burke taught us, that a country to be loved must be lovely.

November 5, 1996
<P>
Dear Rusty
<P>
We win! Again! Almost. 
<P>
I'm sitting here with Tip and the kids watching the early returns -- things are looking pretty good right now. And although it's still too close to call, the phone has been ringing off the hook. 
<P>
Dick Holbrooke called to say he was rested and ready for whatever Cabinet-level foreign-policy post we might need to fill. I thanked him. 
<P>
The second call was from Dad. 
<P>
``Congratulations, my boy,'' he said over the sound of ice in a tall glass. ``Now tell me, how did all those monks get all that money?'' 
<P>
``It's complicated, Dad,'' I said. 
<P>
``You'd better hope it is, boy. You'd better hope it's too complicated for the American people to figure out, too.'' 
<P>
``Dad,'' I said, with a warning tone to my voice, ``don't start with me.'' 
<P>
``Well anyway, congratulations.'' 
<P>
``I haven't won yet, Dad. The polls are still open.''
<P>
``Not for your mother and me,'' he answered. ``We're going to bed.'' 
<P>
And then he hung up. To be honest, Rusty, I was disappointed. His favorite President will always be LBJ for, among other reasons, his incredible fundraising prowess. I thought maybe this was an area in which I could claim some small right to say, ``Look how much I raised, Daddy.'' 
<P>
It's complicated, this father-and-son business. 
<P>
Dick Holbrooke called again, to remind me that in the ``Washington Whispers'' column of U.S. News & World Report his photograph ran with the caption ``Warren Christopher's likely replacement.''
<P>
The next call was from Dick Gephardt. Tipper made me take the call in my study so she could listen in and make gagging faces. 
<P>
``Hello, Dick,'' I said. 
<P>
``Hello, Mr. Vice President,'' Dick responded. ``As you know, it isn't clear yet whether our party has regained control of the House or Senate. But if we do, I will urge the various committee chairs to stop hounding your Administration with groundless investigations.'' 
<P>
``Well, thank you, Dick.'' 
<P>
``The press will have a field day. You know, obstruction of justice, cover-up, that sort of thing. So in an effort to be evenhanded, I think we'll let one investigation go forward. Just for appearances' sake, you understand.'' 
<P>
``I guess I do, Dick,'' I said sadly. ``So which one will continue? Whitewater? Castle Grande?'' 
<P>
``Nope.'' 
<P>
``The billing records? Filegate?'' 
<P>
``Nope.'' 
<P>
``The Travel Office? John Huang?'' 
<P>
``Nope. I think we'll just focus on that Buddhist monastery. Really pick that one apart.'' 
<P>
``Gosh, Dick,'' I said. ``I was at that fund-raiser.'' 
<P>
``You were?'' he asked. ``Really? I guess I hadn't read that. Oh well.'' 
<P>
He's a curious guy, Rusty. I think some of his personal hostility to me comes from the fact that I'm much taller and have eyebrows. The rumor going around town is that he's going to run against me in '00, but I think, in the end, he won't. In fact, I think I'll run unopposed. People just can't seem to get enough of Al Gore. 
<P>
Dick Holbrooke called again, to remind me that his cholesterol was in the lowest percentile. 
<P>
Then Bill called. He was very ``up.''
<P>
``Congratulations, Mr. President,'' I said. ``Although in four years, I guess you'll be saying that to me.'' 
<P>
``Yeah, yeah. About that,'' Bill said. 
<P>
``What's up?'' I asked. I could sense concern.
<P>
``Well,'' he said, ``it's this scandal stuff. I have a feeling it might hamper our agenda.'' 
<P>
``Are you thinking about a pardon?'' I asked, with some trepidation. 
<P>
``Oh yeah,'' he said. 
<P>
``Who?'' I asked. 
<P>
``You,'' he said. 
<P>
``Me?'' I asked. ``Why would you need to pardon me?'' 
<P>
``Not me pardon you, Al. The other way around,'' Bill replied as he hung up.
<P>
Holbrooke called again to discuss his ``Grand Strategy for America in the 21st Century.'' I must have drifted off and started snoring, and he hung up rather abruptly.
<P>
It's still too early to call the election, but it's got all the earmarks of a landslide -- just like in 1972! 
<P>
Gotta run. Ken Starr is on the line. I guess he wants to congratulate me.



<p>

<P>
Your Pal, Al

Vice President Gore says he ``didn't know'' he was in a Buddhist temple when he picked up a check for $140,000. Contributions from tax-exempt organizations are illegal, so it helps not to notice the incense, saffron robes, shaved heads, and gongs when collecting from priests who have taken a vow of poverty.
<P>
<hr>
<P>
It's a story that, for the Clinton Administration, sounds quite familiar: Little Rock connections, Webster Hubbell, casual contempt for the law, Ron Brown wheelings-and-dealings. But it has a host of bizarre twists: a fundraiser held at a Buddhist temple, a multi-billion-dollar Indonesian conglomerate called the Lippo Group, a guy named Gandhi giving more than $300,000 to the Democratic National Committee. None of this tangle, already known as Indogate, will be sorted out before the election, a fact that White House spokesman Michael McCurry openly laughs about. What we do know is that almost certainly money from Indonesian sources has been laundered through Democratic coffers, and that one of the rainmakers, fundraiser John Huang, was rewarded with an influential spot in the Commerce Department; it may well be that the free-flowing Asian cash has influenced the Administration's trade and human-rights policies. However, the scandal probably is of little benefit to Bob Dole in the short term, and in the long term it will only create more pressure for misguided Perot-style campaign-finance reform. So, attention, goo-goo reformers: it doesn't matter what the law is as long as the Administration has no interest in obeying it.
<P>
<hr>
<P>


But who will pardon Clinton?
<P>
<hr>
<P>


Jack Kemp's aspirations were set back by his lackluster performance against Al Gore. Kemp did not clearly win a single exchange with the Vice President. He talked about growth and tax cuts, without making the case for the 15 per cent tax cut that is the centerpiece of the Dole campaign. On questions of foreign policy and American mores, he let Gore position himself to his right. Gore left the Administration wide open for an attack on its policies on race and sex preferences; Kemp fumbled. Worst of all, he seemed to accept Gore's contention that every Republican other than Kemp is a racial troglodyte. Since he doesn't believe that, why didn't he say so? Jack Kemp needs a bridge to his base.
<P>

<P>
No one is happier to see the campaign come to an end than Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary, who wants the plane back.

Democrats were recruiting their congressional candidates during the dog days after the 1994 elections -- and it shows. Here are seven of the wackiest: 1) Maria Elena Milton (running against Rep. John Shadegg, Ariz.), a LaRouche Democrat who supports, ahem, ambitious infrastructure projects like a Eurasian Land Bridge (can that be what they mean by a ``bridge to the future''?); 2) Bill Yellowtail (against Rick Hill, Montana), running despite two felony convictions for knocking off a camera store and stealing $2,000 worth of equipment (hey, if he doesn't win, there's always the White House Security Office); 3) Walter Capps (Rep. Andrea Seastrand, Calif.), who at the Democratic National Convention invoked ``global leaders'' like ``Thomas Jefferson, Franklin Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy, Maya Angelou . . .''; 4) Gerald Houseman (Rep. Mark Souder, Ind.), running in a district dependent on the auto industry after serving as chairman of the Committee for Zero Automobile Growth; 5) Ron Dinicola (Rep. Phil English, Pa.), a Hollywood lawyer with a client list of sleaze balls that puts Johnnie Cochran to shame; 6) Dennis Kucinich (Rep. Martin Hoke, Ohio), whose chief credential is presiding as mayor over the default of the city of Cleveland (hmm, maybe he is qualified); 7) Kevin Quigley (Rep. Jack Metcalf, Wash.) caught laundering campaign funds (and he wasn't even working at the DNC). If all this sounds bad, just wait to see whom the Democrats have lined up for committee chairmanships . . .

<P>
<hr>
<P>

``The last time I checked, the Constitution said 'of the people, by the people, and for the people.' That's what the Declaration of Independence said.'' Read it again, carefully. This was President Clinton refuting Republican ``anti-government'' views to a crowd of supporters after the debate. The last time we checked, the phrase was in Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. No wonder Mr. Clinton sneered at Mr. Dole's ``old'' ideas. He has never encountered any of them.
<P>
<hr>
<P>


Be careful what you ask for. Two of California's largest companies, the electronics giant Hewlett-Packard and the mammoth HMO Kaiser Permanente, asked voters for their opinions on racial favoritism (they didn't phrase it quite like that, to be sure). Their intent in paying for the poll -- and scheduling its release for a few weeks prior to the November elections -- was apparently to slow momentum for the California Civil Rights Initiative, which would consign race and gender preferences in government programs to history's ash heap. But respondents didn't cooperate. The pollsters forsook candor for euphemism, asking for views on ``affirmative action'' rather than ``reverse discrimination,'' but those surveyed still turned thumbs down -- favoring an end to such unfairness in the private sector by 51 per cent to 36 per cent, and in government programs by 49 per cent to 40 per cent. At the same time, 76 per cent supported remedial courses to bring disadvantaged minorities up to speed, so the opposition to preferential hiring can't be caricatured as ``mean spirited.'' All in all, the results were pronounced ``very troubling'' by representatives of the two companies. It does help explain why support for CCRI, at least as of this writing, has proved impervious to every demagogic attack (and there has been no other kind) launched against it. Good sense lives, even in the state that gave us Jerry Brown, Valley Girls, the Summer of Love, Hewlett-Packard, and Kaiser Permanente.

Serious criminals have been ineligible for naturalization since 1802 -- or were, until the Clinton Administration got into the act. Early this month Rosemary Jenks of the Center for Immigration Studies gave the Senate Immigration Subcommittee documents showing that the Administration took unethical -- perhaps illegal -- steps to, in the words of one Gore aide, ``produce a million new citizens before election day.'' The White House pressured the Immigration and Naturalization Service to meet hefty ``production goals.'' INS employees rubberstamped applications, ignoring evidence of fraud on the required English and civics tests. Worse, the INS evaded or ignored the results of FBI fingerprint checks. ``One of these days,'' an INS employee complained in a memo, the INS ``is going to naturalize an axe-murderer.'' FBI and INS records show that hundreds of violent criminals have received citizenship over the last year. Maybe <I>they</I> can replace Craig Livingstone.

New York City voters will unfortunately find it necessary to repeat themselves November 5, when they will vote No on a ballot proposal softening the term limits imposed on the City Council, the mayor, and other officeholders in 1993. The original law, which imposed a two-term limit, would force New York's most limpet-like politicians out of office by 2001. But the City Council has offered a new measure that would raise the limit to three terms and restart the clock, so that many would not have to leave until 2007. The battle pits New Yorkers for Term Limits and Ronald Lauder, who favor the original measure, against Council Speaker Peter Vallone, Mayor Giuliani, and a horde of special interests that have ponied up hundreds of thousands of dollars to pass the new ``reform.'' Their ads say the city will be at a virtual standstill without the Council elders, but polls show that even liberal New Yorkers don't mind that. And if term limits can make it <I>there</I>, they can make it anywhere.

Russia's charismatic hardliner, Gen. Aleksandr Lebed, was the victim of a pre-emptive strike on October 17, when Kremlin rivals forced his ouster as Boris Yeltsin's national security advisor. It was bound to happen sooner or later; only the timing was a surprise. Lebed's rivals feared his free-wheeling diplomacy, his self-promotion, and his growing popularity. The idea of Lebed wielding power inside the Kremlin while Yeltsin was in the hospital for heart surgery seemed too dangerous. But he will be a formidable political force wherever he is. The Russian people, reeling from corruption and mafia/ nomenklatura rule, view Lebed as their potential savior. It is the classic formula for a man on horseback. The Clinton Administration's Russia policy hangs by a (surgical) thread.

God is love, and, during their upcoming conference in Zimbabwe, clergymen from the World Council of Churches want to be allowed to practice godliness on all fronts. They have persuaded Zimbabwe's president, Robert Mugabe, to relax his views on one type of love. Mugabe calls homosexuals ``worse than dogs and pigs'' and punishes homosexual acts with 12-month jail terms. While they're in Harare, though, the gays of the WCC will be free to love each other, and any willing Zimbabweans, as their Christian consciences dictate. Of course this kind of thing -- pressuring Third World nations to alter their traditional folkways to suit Western tastes -- used to be called ``cultural imperialism,'' especially by the WCC. But, ``Behold, I make all things new.''

When she was a 19-year-old student in Birmingham, England, Claire Short got pregnant out of wedlock and gave the baby up for adoption. Miss Short grew up to be a left-wing Member of Parliament. The baby grew up to be Toby Graham, a conservative lawyer who once ran for Parliament as a Tory. Recently Mr. Graham sought out his birth mother and, in a joyous moment for both mother and son, found her. On Mr. Graham's first visit to Miss Short's office, she worried that his ``posh accent'' might alarm her lefty colleagues. It didn't. Since their reunion, Tory son and Labour mom have got along beautifully. Indeed, there is something for everyone in this tale: environmentalists will note that Tory Toby was raised by a rich family; fans of <I>The Bell Curve</I> can see that a mother and son from two different worlds both show ambition, drive, and political skill. Well, for almost everyone. As Miss Short explains, at moments during her pregnancy she contemplated an abortion, but it would have been illegal, and her parents would not have consented to any abortion, legal or otherwise. How many unmarried women who unintentionally get pregnant today will experience such joyous reunions?

<FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT><font size=+1>HE</font> year's most wooed voter waited outside the Louisville Slugger Museum on a chilly Kentucky evening three weeks before the election. In front of this monument to baseball, she sported a blue sweatshirt that declared incongruously ``Soccer Mom For Clinton.'' Still, her patience and clothing investment paid off. A delighted Bill Clinton greeted her with his biggest grin of the day as he worked the crowd following his speech. 
<P>
Clinton supporters with that kind of dedication were thin on the ground. The President with a need to be loved was encountering crowds that mainly wanted to see a celebrity. On his 17-hour campaign trip to Tennessee, Ohio, and Kentucky -- to woo, respectively, partisan Democrats, blue-collar workers, and moderate suburbanites (especially those elusive Soccer Moms) --  most voters were friendly enough. But they had apparently turned out for the meetings without any particular enthusiasm for Mr. Clinton's politics, or indeed any politics. How they went home is quite another matter -- and an alarming one for the GOP.
<P>
The press was, well, too inert to really notice. On the media plane accompanying Air Force One, White House press secretary Mike McCurry cheerfully complained that he was unable ``to raise a pulse'' from the seventy or so regular passengers. ``They just don't think it's a race,'' he explained, checking to make sure my heart wasn't pounding under the illusion that a real political fight might be under way. The seasoned Clinton-watchers balanced their checkbooks and talked baseball between stops.
<P>
Was there, indeed, a presidential race to be interested in? This campaign swing yielded little evidence of one. No local GOP forces bothered to show the flag -- an onlooker at the Knoxville airport whose cap was emblazoned ``Busch'' came near to expressing the only Republican sentiment of the long day. And though Clinton - Gore lawn signs were scattered along the motorcade route, not a single bumper sticker was evident for either ticket. Spirited opposition erupted only once, when people lining the sidewalk in Dayton booed the buses marked ``Media'' -- clearly a bipartisan sentiment.
<P> 
Joe Lockhart, the campaign's press secretary, explained to the few reporters willing to listen that the day's trip was devoted to shoring up the President's lead. And Clinton is clearly energized by the crowds he wades into -- shaking hands, hugging the people closest to him. When it comes to speaking, he calibrates his message to his audience, barely glancing at notes during lengthy, detailed speeches. Judged technically, it is the performance of a professional politician at the top of his form. But does it ``connect'' with his audiences?
<P>
At the first stop, in Knoxville, a friendly audience of partisan Democrats waited more than two hours to hear Al Gore and Bill Clinton. The candidates were there ostensibly to announce an initiative to hook up every classroom in the country to the Internet (not to mention a $100-million subsidy to Silicon Valley) -- what Lockhart calls the ``wonk stuff.'' A large banner on the stage proclaimed: ``Building America's Bridge to the Twenty-First Century.'' Gore, oddly the more animated of the two, raised his arms and waved to the crowd in his awkward schoolboy way, while Clinton merely delivered a small, curt salute.
<P>
It was Gore's job that day to slam the Luddites in the Republican Party (a bold tactic from a foe of the internal-combustion engine). He duly warned against a ``digital divide'' between the haves and the have-nots if every classroom in the country is not on the Internet. He prophesied that nearby Oak Ridge Laboratory would be closed by the Democrats' congressional ``opponents'' who had attempted to cut the science and technology budget by a third. And he reminded the audience that he first started talking about the Information Superhighway twenty years ago. (It seems longer.) In those days he had ``dreamed'' of a girl in Carthage, Tennessee, who could plug into the Library of Congress from her home. (Poor Tipper -- married to the only man for whom a girl is merely a peripheral to a computer.)
<P>
Clinton wisely stuck to computer software, but he communicated real enthusiasm for the wonders of technology. ``There is more computer power in a Ford Taurus you drive to the supermarket,'' he declared, ``than there was in Apollo 11 when Neil Armstrong took it all the way to the Moon.''
<P> 
This was no innocent fascination with applied science -- the President's point was that government deserves the credit for such advances: ``Of the 12 Americans who won the Nobel Prize last year, all 12 had received government support for their research,'' he said. His enthusiasm for technological advance was really an optimistic vision of what the future holds as long as government leads the way. ``I know that you all believe in this,'' he told his Democratic listeners, advising them to fight the current antipathy to government by having at hand ``three or four examples that people can identify with'' of how their tax dollars are being profitably used. 
<P>
He was talking to the right audience. A year ago, the party faithful in Knoxville had little to celebrate. Today they were excited by a rosy future -- not that of technology but that of the Democratic Party under Bill Clinton. They could see public-sector jobs dancing before their eyes.
<P>
It was a different audience that afternoon in Dayton, an enthusiastic blue-collar crowd with young children in tow who gathered in a small square downtown not to cheer a candidate but to see their President. When Air Force One touches down and the President's twenty-car motorcade winds through the streets, a serious kind of carnival comes to town. Sharpshooters prowl the roofs, Secret Service agents in black jumpsuits flank the stage, and ``Hail to the Chief'' heralds the main attraction. All the king's horses and all the king's men provide an excitement missing from the politics of the race.
<P>
Before this bi-partisan audience, Clinton was restrained, self-consciously ``presidential.'' He joined the local politicians on stage with his small salute for the cheering crowd. But he seemed uncomfortable in the lead role. Does he sense that he lacks something, some mysterious presidential gene, some measure of dignity that the office demands? Bill Clinton provokes such questions at regular intervals. At one moment he is all smooth self-confidence; the next moment a nervous little boy peeps out, wondering if the imposture has been detected. This could just explain the gender gap: half the women's vote has been seduced, the other half persuaded they are his mother.
<P>
That day's only mention of foreign policy is also a local reference. Clinton thanked the audience for their role in the Dayton Accords. Special mention went to a woman whose restaurant fed the Bosnian negotiators.
<P>
Having solved the Bosnian question, the President ran through the litany of good news that doubles as his record. Over the past four years 10.5 million new jobs created . . . household income up $1,600 . . . the highest home-ownership rate in 15 years . . . 1.9 million fewer people on welfare . . . the biggest drop in child poverty in twenty years . . . the lowest poverty rate among seniors ever recorded . . . the minimum wage up . . . crime rates down. As he soared to a climax, the President became the very incarnation of Progress. ``We have doubled life expectancy for people living with HIV . . . we have discovered two genes that cause breast cancer.'' Really? Bill on his own? Or Bill, Al, and Hillary? 
<P>
After this list of accomplishments, Clinton declared, ``We are better off than we were four years ago, but we've got a long way to go to build that bridge to the twenty-first century.'' The bridge metaphor is stolen from Bob Dole, and the agenda it represents stolen in part from Newt Gingrich. But these voters, applauding and impressed, have not been persuaded by Dole and Kemp that they could do better.
<P> 
During a bus trip from the airport to a rally site, one reporter tells a colleague that he hadn't been on a campaign trip in a while. ``You're not missing anything,'' he is assured. ``It's still that f --  --  bridge.'' The reporters are merely irritated by the repetition; its significance is either ignored or not grasped. This is a serious lapse -- because if Clinton wins on November 5, the bridge will be transformed into a mandate for enlarging the scope of government.
<P>
<font size=+3>L</font><font size=+1>ockhart</font> admits that the bridge metaphor suggested itself to Clinton after Dole's San Diego speech. Symptomatic of his butterfly-minded campaign, Dole dropped his ``bridge to the past,'' and with it his defense of the virtuous communities of yesteryear, as soon as questions were raised about it. But he had inadvertently provided Clinton with an effective symbol for his second term. Audiences are drawn to the imagery of a bridge that leads to an exciting new century of untold wonders. 
<P>
But they also feel an undercurrent of foreboding, which Clinton encourages. He speaks with urgency about the need to be as prepared as he is for the new millennium. Listeners are meant to conclude that without Clinton to guide them, they might be left behind in this tired old century. Of course, if his audiences were to sit idly in lawn chairs along Knoxville's Interstate 64, the new century would still come upon them. But the President inspires them to want to join him in preparing for the crossing.
<P> 
And what they must do is help him expand the reach of government. Clinton punctuates each mention of a new federal initiative with his raised fist and the plea, ``Will you help me build that bridge to the twenty-first century?'' Audiences invariably applaud.
<P>
The agenda that would usher in the new millennium in a Clinton second term includes tax breaks for education, child care, home-ownership, and health care; an expansion of the Family Leave Act; expansion of health insurance for the unemployed and ``respite benefits'' for families of Alzheimer's patients; federal support for school remodeling; tax credits for college tuition; a corps of tutors to teach reading; a ban on certain bullets; more federal cops on the beat; and Internet access in every classroom. 
<P>
All these programs are meant to appeal to the middle class, and each is modest in itself. The public refused to swallow a whole beaker of federalized health care, but recent audiences appear eager to take the small sips Clinton now offers from the federal trough. 
<P>
As yet, Republicans have not found an effective response to these tactics. Apparently fearful of the post-partum fury of millions of soccer moms, they supported the mandate that insurance companies cover 48-hour hospital stays for mothers and babies after normal deliveries. (When this soccer mom's fingers had to be pried off the bedpost for me to be sent home three days after the birth of my youngest son, it didn't occur to me that my pique should be of concern to the Federal Government.)
<P>
A ragtime band played for the expectant suburban crowd that waited for the President in downtown Louisville. Mike McCurry explained that Clinton was hoping to help freshman Congressman Mike Ward, who is in a tough re-election fight. And the campaign provided him with a pleasant local backdrop for doing so. A 120-foot Louisville Slugger bat stood behind the President as he sat through the local politicians' exploitation of all the obvious metaphors. ``We have 26 'Clinton cops' on our streets because the President went to bat for us,'' declared Louisville's mayor. The President was being invited to hit his message out of the ballpark.
<P>
But in front of the suburbanites he is coolly winning over, Clinton risked no partisan appeal. He implausibly noted the remarkable ``influence'' that Ward had wielded in his one term, but noticeably refrained from a pitch for a Democratic House. The Democratic challenger to Senator Mitch McConnell was praised as a ``fine man,'' but the balance of power in the Senate went unmentioned. It was above-the-battle, soothingly presidential, not about politics at all.
<P> 
And Clinton didn't make the typical liberal case for the welfare state, but rather explained how the Federal Government can step in to reduce the tensions and inconveniences of everyday middle-class life. This notion of a family-friendly Federal Government went down well with this audience.
<P>
A relaxed Mike McCurry stood in the evening chill watching the cheering crowd. He expressed surprise that he had enjoyed such a quiet day just three weeks before the election. Bob Dole, campaigning with Colin Powell in Ohio, had simply not been heard from. ``We had expected an attack on our foreign-policy record, or on ethics, something like 'I'd have people of Colin Powell's caliber in my Cabinet.' But nothing,'' he marveled.
<P> 
The secret of this campaign is that under the guise of non-partisan presidential appearances, politics <I>is</I> going on. As he coasts to re-election, Bill Clinton is fashioning a new Democratic coalition. The partisan liberals who welcomed him to Knoxville are energized by the prospect of victory -- while Dayton's blue-collar voters and Louisville's suburbanites are seduced into increasing their dependence on a government that responds to their ``needs'' one at a time. 
The GOP comforts itself that over 60 per cent of the public believes ``the Federal Government is too big and does too much.'' But how much does that matter when the President is putting in 17-hour days to make that belief a pious irrelevancy -- as irrelevant as his admission that ``the era of Big Government is over''? 
Too many Republicans have convinced themselves that a Clinton victory will be merely an interregnum between idea-fuelled GOP victories in 1994 and 1998. But if Bill Clinton builds a new coalition that includes suburban voters, the GOP will discover that ideas are not everything. Coalitions too have consequences.

<H2>A Question of Character?</H2></CENTER>
<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, OCTOBER 4<br>
In anticipation of the debate, the focus was hard on the presidential contest. What surprises is the universality of comments and even jokes at the expense of Mr. Clinton. A prominent Canadian publisher was saying last summer, ``Most Americans are non-ideological. When all is said and done, they're not going to vote for Clinton against Dole.'' But of course if that were true, why are these non-ideological voters having the pollsters on? If they are disgusted with Clinton because among other things he lies, how do they excuse their own lying to the pollsters?
<P>
Another publisher whispered the joke going the rounds, that Mr. Clinton would turn out to be the first president whose wife made his license plates. The Speaker of the House brandished a $20 bill at a private dinner hosted by Rush Limbaugh. ``Here it is -- that Dole will win.'' ``Aren't you asking for odds'' the taker asked. ``No odds. Even money.''
<P>
There is much buzz about town over the editorial in the weekly <I>New York Observer</I>, a highbrow leftist inner-New York concentrate of political and social passions. It is the creature of Arthur Carter, an engaged multi-millionaire who gets his kicks from opinion, so much so that for quite a few years he owned The Nation magazine, which is where the Bureau of Weights and Measures visits to define hard-left.
<P>
Well, Mr. Carter astonished his audience by running a front-page editorial in the current issue headlined ``Bob Dole, the Right Choice in '96!/A Vote for Character Over Sleaze.'' The editorial goes through the necessary disavowals (``the religious right and the right-to-lifers are wild-eyed fanatics who threaten our hard-won liberties'' to conceive children and then kill them) but quickly comes to the point. ``In this election year, character is not merely one of several issues demanding our attention. It is the only issue. That makes our decision easier. Bob Dole has character, and Bill Clinton has none. So Bob Dole is our choice.''
<P>
The cosmopolitan editor then lets loose. ``We have been embarrassed for nearly four years. We have suffered too long the sins of those yahoos Mr. Clinton transported from Arkansas, so many of whom seem to have spent the entire term answering prosecutors' questions . . . Instead of a role model, we have a floozy who will consort with anyone if it means a bump in the popularity polls . . . His governing style is a product of his generation's self-indulgence and Little Rock's loose political morals. He knows nothing of sacrifice and little of the real world, for he has been talking, and talking, and talking, for the last quarter-century. Historians will one day note that in 1996, the oldest Presidential nominee in U.S. history was a man of action, while one of the youngest incumbents was a sedentary yapper . . . We used to ask our Presidents about great issues of war and peace. We ask President Clinton about his underwear. Worse, he gives us an answer . . . [Hillary is just as bad] Now we have a chance to rid ourselves of both. A perfect twofer.''
<P>
In anticipation of Sunday's debate, much time was given over to advising Sen. Dole. James Carville, the Democratic strategist and overseer of Mr. Clinton's 1992 campaign, was amiable enough to give the other side some advice in <I>Newsweek</I>. He stressed the need for Bob Dole to appear as the underdog, not the loser. And he admonished him not to go after Mr. Clinton personally. ``You know he's going to come back smiling. It'll only feed into the worst perceptions of you (that you're mean-spirited) and best perceptions of him (that he can take a punch).'' Robert Novak advised the candidate to stress Dole's advocacy of a tax cut. The Speaker likes to point out that the average family should reflect that at the end of the first Dole year in office, it would pay $1,300 less to Internal Revenue than under Clinton one more time. The gains would be not only material but political, forcing the shrinkage of a government groaning with the bureaucratic burden.
<P>
Yes, but it isn't easy to get into the ring and draw attention to your fine character, as distinguished from the base character of your opponent. Mr. Carville, in his friendly piece, added, ``Another thing: Don't mention your war wound more than twice. Understand that your injury entitles you to the gratitude and respect of the nation. But not a vote for president.''
<P>
Well, we'll soon see. A lot rides on it, including twenty of Newt's dollars.

White House aides are split over the issue of pardons for Whitewater felons. Some want them announced at the beginning of President Clinton's inaugural address, while others think they should wait until the end.
<P>

Among the Clinton Administration's lucky breaks this year is the timing of investigations into its misconduct: no Whitewater- or Travelgate-related indictments before November, and now no serious second look into Filegate either. In a recent sworn deposition to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Mari Anderson, assistant to Georgetown bouncer <I>cum</I> White House security chief Craig Livingstone, says that contrary to their sworn testimony, Livingstone and other security-office employees knew all along that they were improperly obtaining the files of former GOP officials. She also sheds light on a mysterious six-month gap in a log recording when FBI files were removed from the security office: Livingstone et al. have suggested that the log just wasn't kept during this period, but Miss Anderson says it was, raising the possibility it was removed as part of a cover-up. (Can you say ``18-minute gap''?) Incredibly, Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch agreed to hold no more hearings on the matter before the election in order to win Democratic cooperation on a parks bill. See you next year.

Is it still the economy, stupid? Bill Clinton says so. But in an illuminating cover story in the October 7 <I>Forbes</I> magazine, <I>NR</I>'s Peter Brimelow and Ed Rubenstein examine problems in the current cyclical recovery that Clinton doesn't talk about. For one thing, the recovery is much weaker than the three preceding ones: an expansion of only about 13 per cent since it began (under George Bush, let the record show). And this recovery is now so old that a recession in the next presidential term is almost a statistical certainty. The federal deficit, about 2 per cent of GDP in 1996, is down, as it was at this point in the 1983 - 90 upswing. But that is because defense spending has collapsed (3.6 per cent of GDP today, down from 5 per cent in 1992) and because the Federal Government's tax take (19.4 per cent of GDP, up from 18.4) has risen to a level unprecedented in peacetime. Indeed, counting state and local taxes -- increased largely because of Washington's new habit of mandating programs -- Americans are paying more in taxes than at the height of World War II. Ironically, the bugaboos of the Reagan recovery -- federal borrowing, especially from foreigners; income inequality -- are actually worse under Clinton. Bottom line: Personal income has stagnated throughout the Clinton years. And it seems likely that per capita disposable income in the four quarters prior to the election will turn out to be below its long-term 2.1 per cent growth trend, despite an above-expectations 1996 so far. Since 1952 no incumbent party has held the White House with such wan numbers. This economy would not be a political problem -- for an aggressive opponent.

Under pressure from the Department of Education's Civil Rights office to boost girls' scores on the PSAT, the College Board announced that it would add a multiple-choice section on writing and language structure to the test. It has long been known that boys do better than girls on standardized tests, particularly on the math sections. (On the PSAT math section last year, boys averaged 50.8, on a scale of 20 to 80, compared to the girls' average of 47.4. On the verbal section the scores were 48.8 for boys, 48.6 for girls.) This is a ``problem'' because these tests play a large role in determining National Merit Scholarships, and as a result boys have an ``unfair'' advantage in the competition for these awards. The ``solution'' is to de-emphasize the math section. This is already accomplished by counting the verbal score twice in the Merit selection process; the new verbal section will further decrease the importance of a high math score. Women's groups, such as the Women's Rights Project, justify such tampering on the grounds that the tests <I>must</I> be ``biased'' against girls, since girls tend to receive slightly higher grades than boys in both high school and college. However, it seems more likely that any bias resides in the grades, which are subjectively awarded, than in the tests, which are scored by a machine. If we want to award equal numbers of scholarships to boys and girls, fine: make that the policy (keeping in mind that to do so tarnishes the actual achievements of girls). But stop pretending that these tests are standardized and these scholarships are based on merit.

A man wearing a Bob Dole mask and a ``really ugly yellow tie'' robbed a bank in Wheaton, Illinois, and, as he left, reminded everyone to vote. Mr. D. Craig Livingstone refuses to disclose how he is paying for his quickly mounting legal bills in the Filegate affair. These two items may be unrelated.

Sen. John Kerry (D., Mass.) is a standard-issue down-the-line liberal. His opponent, Republican Gov. William Weld, styles himself an economic conservative and a social liberal. That's half true. Weld supports every item on the agenda of left-wing homosexual activists. But state spending has increased in his tenure and income-tax rates remain essentially at Dukakis levels. Weld favors discrimination against white males, environmental regulation, and industrial policy. He would provide crucial reinforcement for the dwindling ranks of liberal Republicans in the Senate. Worse, he is smart and affable; in the old boys' club of the Senate, he would tug the Republican caucus to the Left, damaging conservative causes far more than a re-elected Kerry. It's quite a dilemma. Weld's appalling rush to defend President Clinton for vetoing the partial-birth-abortion ban, however, tips the scale. To oppose first-trimester abortions requires an act of intellection which not all well-meaning people will make; to approve killing a baby in the process of being born indicates a deep failure of moral sentiment. Under the circumstances, we must urge conservatives to cast their votes for Conservative Party candidate Susan Gallagher.

California Attorney General Dan Lungren, an attractive young GOP figure, has been kicking up his heels. In August, he raided the San Francisco Cannabis Buyers Club -- which sells marijuana to people suffering from cancer, AIDS, and glaucoma -- on the grounds that pot-heads were getting it for recreational use (the Cannabis Buyers Club disputes the charge). This month, when characters in <I>Doonesbury</I> lamented the move, Lungren urged California newspapers to cancel the strip, saying it would ``lend credibility'' to Proposition 215 -- a referendum to legalize medical marijuana. We say Mr. Lungren loses credibility by fighting the drug war on its least defensible front. Will he ask California newsstands not to carry this issue?

In response to the new law restricting welfare for immigrants, George Soros, the Hungarian-born money manager, has announced that he will put up $50 million to start the Emma Lazarus Fund, which will aid legal immigrants by financing their citizenship applications and efforts to learn English. We applaud Mr. Soros's initiative. Appropriately, he is using his own money -- there was no welfare in Emma Lazarus's day -- and that money will (reportedly) go to immigrants themselves, rather than to professional lobbyists using immigrants to extort money from ordinary Americans, as is notoriously the case with Ford Foundation grants. But Mr. Soros must not stop here. In fairness, he should finance another fund to aid native-born Americans facing lower wages, job displacement, overcrowded schools, and the cost of relocation from their overwhelmed communities. He could even name it after someone who is being phased out of the American pantheon to make room for new heroes and heroines like Emma Lazarus -- someone who thought America did not need immigrants at all except perhaps for a few ``useful mechanics'' -- old whatshisname -- we've got it! -- George Washington.

The Afghan Taliban are getting a bad press in the West but, in fact, their rule could prove quite popular if they conquered Washington, D.C., as well as Kabul. True, some aspects of their Islamic political correctness might raise an eyebrow or two. For example, not everyone would enjoy having to grow a beard. Not everyone would gladly rise before dawn for the first of five daily prayers. The Taliban's encouraging women to stay (literally) at home might also be considered in some quarters to be a little over the top. But there would be compensations. The Taliban have banned television, music, and co-ed public transportation. In other words, three scourges of modern life -- mindless TV junk, the cacophony which passes for music these days, and overcrowded public transport -- would be eliminated at one bold stroke. Washington in particular would also benefit from the Taliban's crime-fighting tactics. After the first few hundred thieves started walking about the city without right hands, our crime rate would surely drop too. Most importantly, the Taliban would reduce inflationary pressures that might be building up again. A Kabul butcher who tried to sell his products above the official price had two of his fingers chopped off, which, while not monetarist in spirit, should surely be acclaimed by the bond market for anti-inflationary zeal. After the latest developments in Kabul, who can now say that the Clinton Administration, which has made friendly overtures toward the Taliban, supports only liberal causes?

As the house organ of the international New Class, fiscally conservative but socially liberal, <I>The Economist</I> has long felt highly modified rapture toward Margaret Thatcher. All the more significant, therefore, is its considered judgment on the balance-sheet of Thatcherism in a recent survey of Britain's new politics. After scrupulously examining the economic statistics on growth, productivity, and much else (and dispelling scores of much-loved left-wing myths in the process), it concludes: ``Until about 1979, Britain's economic decline relative to other countries was precipitous; since then, the decline has been arrested, and there are now signs that Britain is improving its position. If so, no other British government in modern times can claim as much.'' Within this broad conclusion, it cites dramatic achievements for the Iron Lady in labor-market reforms, privatization (in 1979 the cost of state support for nationalized industries ``was equivalent to e300 [$480] a year for every taxpayer. The privatized companies now . . . pay taxes on profits that amount to e100 [$160] a year for every taxpayer''), and competitiveness (in the 1980s, ``of Europe's ten most successful firms, seven were British''). All in all, the <I>Economist</I> survey reads like a British equivalent of NR's own ``The Real Reagan Record.'' But perhaps Mrs. Thatcher's greatest achievement is the modern Labour Party, which, under the shrewd leadership of Tony Blair, denounces her policies but promises not to reverse them.

The following letter to the editor appeared in the <I>New York Times</I>. We reprint it, admiringly. ``Congratulations for giving voice to the victims of the latest assault on the women of America ('Harassment in 2nd Grade? Queens Kisser Is Pardoned,' front page, Oct. 3). Reported incidents of second-grade kissing, the nation's most underreported crime, have doubled in the last week alone. Furthermore, studies have shown that most second-grade kissing occurs during recess, thereby detracting from the quality of the milk-and-cookies experience. As a result, many schoolgirl victims go on to develop anorexia and are therefore unable to protect themselves when they receive the traditional Super Bowl beating. For too long the tragedy of second-grade kissing has been ignored by the political and educational power structure. Careful research has shown that if boys kiss girls in the second grade, they will kiss them again in the future. Clearly these are not isolated incidents; they form a pattern. It is the pattern of a serial kisser. There is still time before the November elections for the presidential candidates to present their plans for dealing with this horror before more lives are ruined, so that we can go back to the important work of building on the successes of our public school system. [Signed] Joe Benning, Summit, N.J.''

The skeleton of a 9,300-year-old white guy has been unearthed at Kennewick, Washington, supporting a theory that Europeans crossed the Siberian land bridge around the same time Indians did -- or, who knows? maybe before. What happened to these white Native Americans at the hands of their red-skinned neighbors remains unclear, but the word ``genocide'' comes to mind. A committee of Shriners and Rotarians, acting as the modern-day descendants of the prehistoric white tribes, should draw up a list of demands, including reparations plus 9,300 years of interest, casino rights, and any ancient loafers or martini shakers that turn up.

Union, N.J.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT><font size=+1>T'S</font> a sparse crowd at the Dole -  Kemp rally in Union, N.J., on this morning, the first cold snap of the season. I'm standing next to Buttman, wondering if I can bum a cigarette off him. The chill hasn't cooled Jack Kemp's ardor; his only concession to it is to promise a brief speech, which he accomplishes not by abbreviating his remarks but by talking even faster than usual. America is ``on the eve of the twenty-first century, a new millennium'' which will see ``a rebirth of freedom,'' ``an economic and social renaissance.''
<P>
When it comes to rebirth, Kemp knows whereof he speaks: his own political career has only recently emerged from a deep freeze. After 1992 he became the front-runner for presidential nomination. But in the intervening years Kemp lost a lot of support from party leaders, who tired of his indiscipline, and from conservative activists and intellectuals, who complained about his apostasies on labor, on spending, on immigration. The first group has been pleasantly surprised by the discipline Kemp has exhibited on the campaign trail. He has moved rightward on affirmative action and state benefits for illegal immigrants; his violent opposition to school choice during his 1988 presidential campaign is a distant memory. Otherwise, he has done little to appease his conservative critics.
<P>
Distant galaxies can receive light from dead stars. There is still an enormous reservoir of good will toward Kemp among rank-and-file Republicans. Republicans like having a spokesman who can't be trashed as mean-spirited or bigoted. When Kemp's selection was announced in Russell, Kan., he said, ``Bob and I are going to be asking for the support of every single American from the boroughs of New York to the barrios of California. . . . No one will be left behind and no one will be turned away.'' They're such simple little words, it's a wonder so few Republicans have the wit to say them.
<P>
In Union, Kemp said, ``This country has a great philosophy in both Jewish and Christian tradition that you do not leave the wounded behind, that you do not leave the weak behind, that you do not leave the elderly behind, that you do not leave the unborn behind.'' And then he segued into a defense of legal immigration. What links Kemp's positions on immigration, abortion, and economics is the view that people are potential assets, not liabilities. Whether or not he's right on the particulars, it's an appealing mindset and a compelling vision.
<P>
Kemp displays an unfailing dignity and civility, even when dealing with truly obnoxious protestors. (Such as the ones whose cries of ``Chicano power!'' were drowning out his wife's talk in her hometown of Fillmore, California.) He insists that Bill Clinton and Al Gore are ``our opponents, not our enemies.'' FDR, JFK, Hubert Humphrey: Kemp conjures up more dead liberals than the First Lady. At his best, this irenicism elevates politics. But it can easily degenerate into the Rodney King school of conservatism (``Can't we all just get along?''). He won't ``go negative'': he told the <I>Today</I> show, ``Nobody can tell me to do something I cannot do.'' The traditional metaphor for politics has been warfare, not football. (No, fans, they're not the same thing.) But the notion of politics as civil combat is lost on Kemp.
<P>
Kemp's stump speech includes the line, ``Out of many we must become one.'' Taken seriously, as a hardheaded project rather than an airy sentiment, that ambition would require rigorous thought and action. Is Kemp willing to act on the implications? He has been notably unhelpful to the California Civil Rights Initiative for the repeal of race and gender preferences, offering lukewarm support coupled with stern warnings not to ``tear up the state of California.'' Ward Connerly, chairman of the campaign for CCRI, notes that the civil-rights movement of the Fifties and Sixties was also ``divisive'' (which doesn't stop Kemp from chiding conservatives for having been on the wrong side).
<P>
One can sometimes detect a whiff of racial condescension in Kemp's rhetoric. Take his praise, however qualified, for Louis Farrakhan: it's impossible to imagine him speaking similarly about a white bigot who supported ``family values.'' (To judge from his speech in Union, Kemp may share Farrakhan's fascination with numerology: ``Four children, and 11 grandchildren, which adds up to 15, and I wore 15, and that's the size of the tax cut you will get.'') Yet there is a rough equality to his condescension: it embraces black and white alike. His pose as <I>the</I> racially enlightened Republican can exasperate his allies.
<P>
<font size=+3>N</font><font size=+1>OTABLY</font> absent from Kemp's rhetoric is any tragic sense of life, any sense of evil -- which is another way of saying that he lacks a conservative sensibility. He told the crowd in Union, ``That's what it means to be an American: to have nothing stand in your way, no barriers.'' Fr. Richard John Neuhaus, editor of the religious conservative journal <I>First Things</I>, finds in Kemp's politics traces of Christian Science, the faith of his youth, with its emphasis on the positive disposition of the will rather than on Original Sin. ``Jack's a throwback -- and I mean that in a positive and complimentary sense -- to a strain of can-do Americanism that believes that there is an answer to every problem, and that the answer is basically in the human will and the human mind.'' So, for Kemp, sustaining a free society is easy. All capitalism takes is access to capital; the inner city will bloom once we crack down on redlining. And faster economic growth is an adequate substitute for welfare reform.
<P>
Yet the standard charge that Kemp is too economistic -- that, as Pat Buchanan says, he believes in <I>Homo economicus</I> -- isn't entirely true. ``He's way ahead of the pack of other politicians in his understanding of religion and public life,'' says Neuhaus. His thoughtful speech on that subject at this year's Christian Coalition conference has won him (and its drafter, Mike Gerson) plaudits. More than any other public figure besides William Bennett, Kemp talks about the importance of the ``mediating structures'' of church, family, and civic groups. Within the Dole campaign, Kemp has been pushing for more attention on the horror of partial-birth abortion.
<P>
Kemp's intellect, too, gets unfairly knocked behind the closed doors of Republican insiders. True, he has the rough edges and ungainly enthusiasms of the self-taught, and he heeds to the sometimes-eccentric counsel of Jude Wanniski. But, as James Pinkerton points out, ``Kemp was smart enough to identify the single biggest intellectual movement to hit the Republican Party in the last half-century, which was the supply-side movement, and lead it.'' Supply-sider Alan Reynolds says, ``I think Jack is a little more serious than people give him credit for being. This isn't to say that he can handle every possible criticism -- he can handle most of them -- or that he can't be led astray by an argument that sounds good on the face of it but really isn't.'' He was the only major politician to provide a largely accurate critique of the Mexican devaluation and bailout of late 1994, and he appears to have arrived at it on his own.
<P>
His campaign does, however, leave him open to the charge of self-indulgence. His ostentatious refusal to go negative -- the normal job of a vice-presidential nominee -- is one example. Another is his disinclination to talk about the centerpiece of Dole's platform, the 15 per cent tax cut: instead of quantifying its benefits, Kemp mentions it as ``a down payment'' on radical tax reform (reviving an argument he lost, and probably deserved to lose, within the campaign). And then there's Kemp's failure, novel in his career, to court Reagan Democrats. One former Kemp staffer says, ``What I hear everywhere I go is, When are they going to unleash Kemp? Where's Jack?'' The answer: He's at the New Jersey Black Issues Convention in New Brunswick, a resolutely liberal gathering. Or he's in Harlem, or somewhere else where the Republican ticket won't win many votes. These visits may be reassuring to moderate suburbanites. Still, says longtime Kemp advisor Lawrence Kudlow, ``He needs to hang out with more football fans in near-in suburbs of Pittsburgh and Detroit and places like that where this election will be won or lost.''
<P>
Neither Kemp nor Dole has ever won a campaign involving a large, competitive electorate. This year probably won't change that record. Regardless, Kemp will still have a claim on conservative attentions. David Frum, who critiqued Kemp vigorously in <I>Dead Right</I>, says that Kemp is ``an old flame'' for conservatives: when he reappears after some years, they remember his attractions and forget what made him so impossible. Both traits were on display at the Black Issues Convention. In the midst of his rambling peroration, he declared, ``This is the <I>most</I> . . . <I>exciting</I> . . . <I>world</I> . . . <I>in history</I>'' -- raising, not for the first time, the question of what planet he is living on. Wherever it is, no doubt it's an inviting place.

NEW YORK, SEPTEMBER 27<br>







The man on my right was Mr. Civic-Minded Citizen, and soon conversation closed in on the problem of education. In his hometown of Midland, Texas, he told me, the black population is about 5 per cent. But some years ago a federal judge ordered busing in an attempt to bring about integration by the checkerboard approach. What happened, he says, is that in grades 1, 2, and 3, Midland children do exactly as well as their peers elsewhere. ``But when they get to fourth grade, they are moved into a pool,'' from which the individual student is sent to this school or that, designed to effect what in the Sixties was called ``scatteration.'' From that point on through the rest of their primary education their academic achievements move down. Why? ``Because they are separated from the children they have been associated with, their teachers are mostly concerned with goals other than education. Anyway'' -- his hands moved up, resignedly, ``that's what happened.'' Was there no way to placate the judge with another plan that retained the neighborhood school and effected integration? ``Nothing we've come up with.''
<P>
Elsewhere, the education issue focuses strongly on ``Catholic schools.'' The term is in quotation marks because the Catholic schools under consideration are hardly seminaries designed to introduce young students to recent papal encyclicals. The schools in question -- in New York, in Washington, D.C., in Milwaukee -- aren't restricted to Catholic students. One high school in New York, with which I am familiar, is preponderantly black and Hispanic, its students primarily from single-parent households. One course in religion is taught, as one might expect. It has never been asserted about the school that it is primarily a religious institution. But in order to attend it, students' families, or friends, have to come up with $3,000. The cost per student in the public schools is $9,000. In the public schools, 15 per cent or fewer of the graduates go on to college. In the Catholic schools, the figure is 85 per cent.
<P>
Mr. William Bulger, formerly the undeniable boss of the city of Boston, and president of the Massachusetts Senate for almost 18 years, fought hard against the ideological bureaucracy, whose militant right hand has been the <I>Boston Globe</I>. In his book, <I>While the Music Lasts: My Life in Politics</I>, Mr. Bulger, now a professor at the University of Massachusetts, recalls the havoc brought on by the grandees of social architecture whose first (and only) mandate has been integration. But a side interest, fanatical in other quarters, has been a reading of the First Amendment that tells us that it is unconstitutional to ``use public money'' for ``religious schools.'' The teachers' unions are mobilized on the issue, and, as with busing, nothing very much happens except illiteracy, which prospers.
<P>
On another bent, a street-wise Democratic office-holder spoke about what one might expect from President Clinton in Term Two. ``Of course, he will do something about Medicare expenses. Why? Because he has to.'' Indeed. Unless by the year 2001 somebody invents a pill that abolishes every affliction from aneurysms to whooping cough, permitting Americans at an agreeable old age to wake up dead one morning, we are heading for an unbearable fiscal problem. My acquaintance reminded me that Mr. Fiscal is greatly profiting from the Depression of the Thirties. How so? Well, Americans walking into the retirement ages of 62 - 65 aren't very numerous, because back in 1931 - 34 Americans were not having many children. But as morale mounted, in mid-decade, the birth rate rose. Its effects will be felt at the end of the century. 
<P>
It is sad, really, that no major political candidate is facing these issues head on. A successful Catholic school is no more offensive to general social objectives than a Catholic hospital that has crosses in patients' rooms. Under-educated black children are not benefited by under-educated white children. A slight stall in public spending on Medicare and Social Security does not make the looming crisis disappear. But our democratic system tends not to give us the major issues to confront. What if Mr. Dole had said that the Medicare program simply had to be rewired; that if the Constitution is really telling us that busing is required and religious schools are ineligible for public support, then let's revise the First Amendment, to make it mean what we lived with quite comfortably for a hundred and fifty years.
<P>
What a rush such proposals would bring to Inert America. And if this time around he failed, Mr. Dole would have the satisfaction felt by Winston Churchill, the first few times around.

Dear Rusty
<P>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->


<BR>
<BR>
<P>







We win!!
<P>
Well, almost. Bill had a terrific first debate with Bob Dole. ``Four years ago, you took me on faith. Now, there's a record.'' Pretty good, huh? 
<P>
So now it's up to me to give Jack Kemp the old Gore one-two, and let me tell you, I am raring to go! I've spent the past few days boning up on Kemp's record, and I am prepared to play hardball. I'm not proud of it, but I do understand the essential role of the Vice President, which is, besides preparing to run for President myself, to get tough on the opposition. 
<P>
``If you liked Ronald Reagan, you'll love Jack Kemp!'' How's that for withering? And trust me, there's more where that came from.
<P> 
I'm sitting in the green room right now, Rusty, waiting for the red light to go on and for the debate to begin. And I'll be honest with you: I'm not at all nervous. I banished Tipper from the room a few minutes ago -- she was pretty helpful getting me ready for tonight, but I got tired of hearing her ask me every five minutes to ``do the Macarena one more time.'' I mean, I'm no show-business expert -- although I believe that Bill Clinton and I have contributed significantly to reducing the amount of violence that reaches our children through television, and we've been highly active in preparing our nation for the future of telecommunications (How does that sound? Too stiff? Let me know) -- but my understanding of show business is that you always leave them wanting more. So no, I don't plan to ``do the Macarena'' again, no matter how much Tipper asks.
<P>
In a way, Rusty, tonight is just a warm-up. Let's be honest: Bill and I are cruising to victory in November. After that, it's basically four years of prosperity, a couple of cold days in Iowa and New Hampshire, and then it's me and Jack Kemp, back again behind a couple of lecterns. 
<P>
So, tonight, I have to establish my strength. Let me give you a sample of my battle plan: 
<P>
If Kemp talks about his nutty tax-cut idea, my response is going to be: ``As I cradled my dying sister in my arms, held her for the last time, as the tears streamed down her cheeks, mingled with mine, she looked up into my eyes and said, 'Al, promise me that you won't take the country back to the supply-side Reagan Eighties, which gave tax cuts to the rich and ballooned the deficit, saddled our children with debt and widened the gap between rich and poor.''' 
<P>
If Kemp talks about the environment, my response is going to be: ``As my son, bleeding and unconscious, lay in the street -- I could hear the sirens wail as the ambulance drew near, and Tipper was silently praying -- and I noticed that his little body was slumped against a storm drain, a drain that empties directly into the ocean, I made a silent vow that I would do everything in my power to clean up the environment.''
<P>
If Kemp makes a comment about drug use going up, my response is going to be: ``When my daughter -- whom I love more than anything -- ate ice cream too quickly, she suffered from a tremendous headache. And as she clutched at her head, exclaiming loudly at the pain, Tipper and I both put down our spoons, looked at each other, and made a solemn vow to fight this deadly scourge that afflicts our children.'' 
<P>
If he brings up Bosnia or Haiti: ``My father, who was himself a senator from Tennessee, is almost ninety years old. He won't live very long. Even now, he sometimes has trouble remembering which of my daughters is which. He calls Tipper 'Flipper' occasionally. He's a prime stroke candidate, and to be honest, if the phone rang right now with the news that he had had a nasty fall in the bathroom, well, I wouldn't be surprised. But even in his somewhat addled state, he knows that our policy in Haiti has brought some stability to that troubled island nation, and that our actions in Bosnia, while they do involve the massive deployment of American military personnel, are necessary, and anyone who doubts this is insulting his life's work and smearing his memory, even though he isn't dead yet. But he will be soon. And when he is, I'll make a solemn vow.'' (I think that one needs a little work, so I'm hoping that Kemp steers clear of foreign policy.)
<P>
On welfare reform: ``This morning Tipper noticed a milky discharge from her left eye. We think it could be serious. I'm very worried. She's been sluggish and run down lately. The doctors don't give her much chance of recovery.'' 
<P>
On Bill's character: ``I have a lump in my breast. Male breast cancer is rare and very deadly.'' 
<P>
Talk about rapid response! On to victory! 
<P>
See you at Inaugural II!

Bill Clinton says he wants to send a robot to Mars. But what will the Vice President do when he gets there?

Democrats led by Rep. David Bonior (D., Mich.) are demanding that the House Ethics Committee waive its usual procedures and immediately release a preliminary fact-finding report in which the committee's outside counsel purportedly discusses the use of tax-deductible funds to support a history course Newt Gingrich taught in Georgia. Under committee rules, ethics complaints cannot be filed within sixty days of a general election, so as to avoid the very politicizing Bonior et al. are attempting here. Almost all Bonior's many ethics complaints about Gingrich have been dismissed or found to be minor or technical infractions. The Ethics Committee should not release its final report until it's ready. Meanwhile, it should commission one on the allegations of bank fraud, tax fraud, and financial-disclosure fraud wafting around Minority Leader Richard Gephardt.

Dick Morris wasn't on the cover for once, so in case you didn't automatically reach for the <I>Star</I> this week, you missed: DICK MORRIS PLOTTED GAY SMEAR ON JACK KEMP. ``President Clinton's disgraced political guru Dick Morris revealed over pillow talk with Sherry Rowlands that Democratic operatives were running a dirty-tricks campaign against Bob Dole and Jack Kemp. . . . The sleazy tactics by Clinton's top political strategist are the latest bombshells in Rowlands's diaries of her year-long kinky sex-for-cash affair with Morris.''

When Bill Clinton signed the Defense of Marriage act, he didn't do it at a Rose Garden ceremony with TV handshakes and multiple souvenir pens. He, no kidding, signed it at midnight on his campaign plane. The law that dare not speak its name.

In just the last two weeks, 6,000 people in Houston, 10,000 in Dallas, and almost 15,000 in San Jose have taken the oath of citizenship. In Chicago, an estimated 70,000 new citizens have been minted in 1996. The country has opened its arms to nearly 1.3 million new Americans this year -- nearly triple the 450,000 welcomed in 1995, which itself was an all-time record, the previous high having been set in 1944. The Administration maintains that the mass swearings-in were designed to eliminate the backlog of applicants who became eligible for citizenship in 1994 by establishing legal residency under the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. But only 600,000 applicants were trapped in the INS bureaucracy. In fact, the $77-million program called Citizenship U.S.A. is a Democratic campaign operation. According to Immigration and Naturalization Service records, local Democratic politicians and community groups were charged with shepherding applicants to the INS, where they would receive accelerated treatment. Background checks for police records have been sloppily performed, fingerprinting has been assigned to untrained volunteers, English-language tests have been administered in Spanish, and green cards (with a street value of nearly $30,000) have not been collected after new citizens take the oath. The House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight is now investigating how many unqualified applicants slipped through the system. What about the unqualified citizens responsible for this affront to our laws and our society?

Remember the ban on HIV-positive immigrants? In 1992, Bill Clinton, trolling for gay votes, announced he would lift it if elected. In 1993, Congress replied by enacting the ban into law -- and Clinton, reversing himself, signed the bill. Now Paul Mulshine, an enterprising columnist for the <I>Newark Star-Ledger</I>, has discovered that Clinton has quietly reversed himself again. This summer, the Administration told the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV - AIDS that infection with the virus is to be considered a ``characteristic'' that makes the victim eligible for political asylum. Already, an HIV-positive illegal alien has won asylum partly by claiming that there is no medical treatment for AIDS in Togo. ``The Clinton Administration has in this instance outdone itself,'' comments Mulshine. ``[It] took a law that made HIV-positive status a bar to immigration, inserted it into the intellectual meat grinder and produced a ruling that makes HIV-positive a bonus.'' Over to you, Mr. Dole.

Since Jack Kemp will be around for several election cycles to come, what he said about Louis Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam should be tacked firmly into place. Kemp has made it his mission to bring the GOP to blacks. A million men is a bigger crowd than any other leader, black or white, could summon. Even in his original <I>Boston Globe</I> interview, Kemp began by placing his remarks in a general context: ``In the black community, more and more black church leaders are telling men to be responsible fathers.'' Perhaps the most naive thing Kemp said was his subsequent backtracking call on Farrakhan to renounce bigotry. Of course Farrakhan won't renounce bigotry -- it is integral to his faith (which holds that whites are demons bred in prehistoric times on the island of Patmos). Kemp will show the greatest respect for blacks by giving them his message straight up -- and since he won't be invited to any Million Man Marches, he'll have to keep doing it one man at a time.

When Bill Clinton vetoed the partial-birth-abortion ban last spring, he argued that the procedure is necessary to protect the health of expecting mothers in the third trimester of a complicated pregnancy. Women's health is very important to the President -- but not more important than the right to abortion on demand. The Administration has rushed to bring the French abortion drug, RU-486, to domestic markets, recently declaring it ``safe'' for public consumption, even though there are clear signs that it is dangerous -- and not just to the baby it starves and then ejects from the womb. Many of the women who take the pills complain of intense pain, nausea, and prolonged bleeding for up to 44 days; 2 per cent hemorrhage and require surgical intervention to save their lives. In the French RU-486 trials, one woman died, and others suffered heart attacks. Clinton has long maintained that he wants abortion to be ``safe [and] legal'' (forget ``rare'') -- but evidently not in that order.

On September 19, prominent heart patient Boris Yeltsin signed a decree instructing the Russian ``power ministries'' (Defense, Interior, Security, and Foreign Affairs), which normally report to the president, to ``coordinate their activities'' with the prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin. During any actual surgery, the nuclear button would be temporarily entrusted to the prime minister as well. But within a few days, Yeltsin's doctors were speaking of a one- or two-month delay of the operation, due to the damaged condition of the presidential heart. (They waffled on earlier reports that Yeltsin had suffered a full-fledged but well-covered-up heart attack in late June, between the first and second rounds of the presidential election. There are limits to <I>glasnost</I>, apparently.) Whatever happens in the Kremlin operating room, Russia is in for an extended period of unstable government -- and the Clinton Administration's Russia policy, which has gambled everything on the personality of one man, hangs by a suture.

North Korea, with which the Clinton Administration so proudly forged a ``new relationship'' by the nuclear accord of October 1994, still carries on relations with South Korea in a very old spirit. Some 25 well-armed North Korean commandos sneaked ashore from a submarine near Kangnung on South Korea's northeast coast. Eleven crew members were found dead, either by mass suicide or murdered by their leaders; seven commandos were intercepted and killed by South Korean forces; one was captured. Others were missing and the object of an intensive manhunt, with the exact purpose of their mission as yet unknown. What is known is that the Clinton Administration will continue to prop up the decrepit but dangerous North Korean regime with food, aid, and diplomatic legitimacy.

<P>

Newly declassified government documents suggest that nine hundred American servicemen remained captive in North Korea after the prisoner exchange of 1952. That grisly medical experiments were performed on them sadly comes as no surprise -- unlike the suggestion, backed up by incriminating documents, that President Eisenhower and his Administration knew of the fate of the missing servicemen from the beginning. The Defense Department estimates that there are 15 Americans alive in captivity to this day. Pyongyang's denunciation of the charges, of course, is meaningless, and Congress is right to ask questions until the question is resolved.

Iranian authorities have announced they will soon be producing ``Islamic'' CD-ROM video games, to counter ``corrupt Western computer games.'' According to Mohammad Hussein Ali-Mohammadi, head of the Islamic Revolution Cultural Documentation Organization: ``The enemy is targeting us with ominous and anti-cultural software.'' Coming soon: a video game inspired by the 1980 - 88 Iran - Iraq war, with texts in Farsi, Arabic, and English. Order yours now!

Freedom House, a secular human-rights group, has just issued a study called <I>In the Lion's Den</I>, which details widespread -- and largely unreported -- persecution of Christians around the globe. Among the report's findings: 1996 has been ``the most repressive period'' since the 1970s for Christians in China, where police are circulating warrants for over 3,000 evangelicals; in Sudan, Christian children are spirited from their families and sold in open-air slave markets; and in Saudi Arabia, it is illegal to wear a cross, read a Bible, or even pray in one's home. Those who ignore such oppressions while claiming to speak out for human rights will be condemned by their silence. The book can be ordered by calling 1-800-451-READ.

Did President Reagan, CIA Director William Casey, and Pope John Paul II conspire to ruin the Soviet Union? <I>His Holiness</I>, by Watergate reporter Carl Bernstein and Vatican expert Marco Politi, says the Kremlin viewed the accession of the new Polish Pope with fear and anger (and, it should be added, probably was behind the assassination attempt upon him). The Reagan Administration put $50 million into the anti-Communist Polish Solidarity movement, in return for which the Pope refused to criticize the deployment of a new generation of missiles in Europe, thus ditching the European Catholic Left. CIA Director Casey and former deputy Director Vernon Walters met secretly and repeatedly with the Pope, the three of them agreeing that Poland was the nationalist and Catholic weak point in the Evil Empire. In all of this, William Casey appears to have been the strategic thinker. His successful scheme to manipulate the international oil market in order to damage the main Soviet source of hard currency has yet to be fully explored. His support, legal and illegal, for the Contras issued defeats for the Communists in Central America. Casey's story may never be told  -- such was the nature of his role -- but he looms still larger in <I>His Holiness</I>.

One, ah, footnote to the Dick Morris story. Even as he closed his $2.5-million book deal, he was feted at a newsmaker's luncheon at <I>The New Yorker</I>. Such freak shows are typical of the tenure of editor Tina Brown (whose husband, Harold Evans, signed Morris's book contract). But how do her colleagues feel about them? Henry Louis Gates Jr., the respected Harvard professor? Henrik Hertzberg, the deft political essayist? Stylish James Wolcott? Earnest Ken Auletta? Any pangs, twinges? The averted face, the furrowed brow? Gentlemen?

The lead character of the Disney/Touchstone-produced sitcom <I>Ellen</I>, played by comic Ellen DeGeneres, will probably come out of the closet this season, becoming the first homosexual starring character on TV (there are already a number of minor homosexual characters on other shows). Already the air is dark with flying platitudes. ``Ellen is trying to break new ground,'' says the actress's agent. ``It reflects Hollywood's commitment to diversity,'' says a gay activist. On the other (our) side, some Religious Right types will boycott Disney, and some pundit types will uphold their right to do so. But is that any less boring? The only way for conservatives to fight the culture wars in the long run is to become screen writers -- and novelists, and poets. Poets <I>are</I> the unacknowledged legislators of the world. Men live by bread, and they live under laws, but they live for stories. If there are better stories than the ones liberalism tells us (and there are), someone must tell them.

The Board of Visitors of the Virginia Military Institute voted 9 to 8 to admit women for the first time in the school's 157-year history. Facing dim prospects for raising enough money to go private and maintain VMI's all-male identity, the Board took the only course left, a result ordained at least since 1990 when the Justice Department sued the Institute for violating the Civil Rights Act and the equal-protection clause by its exclusion of women. VMI superintendent Josiah Bunting, while insisting that physical requirements will not be lowered for female cadets, admits that even this last hold-out for the old standards is likely to open the school to further lawsuits. Trustee Anita K. Blair predicts that a ``co-ed VMI soon will become indistinguishable from the existing cadet programs'' at other public institutions. In other words, a co-ed VMI will no longer be VMI. Have the cadets look up ``Pyrrhic victory'' in their manuals.

Tupac Shakur, the 25-year-old gangsta rapper gunned down in Las Vegas last week, lived and died the ghetto life. The son of a Black Panther, Shakur achieved fame by glorifying violence, drugs, and the degradation of women. No hypocrite, he practiced what he preached. Arrested numerous times, in 1993 he went to prison for beating a video director in a parking lot. In 1994 he was given four and a half years for his part in sexually assaulting a woman (two friends were also involved) and served eight months. While he reportedly believed in ``The Code'' -- a set of rules to stop violence in the inner city which required: 1) no drive-by shootings, 2) no random killings, 3) no drug dealing in the 'hood, and 4) no snitching -- somehow, that wasn't enough.

President Clinton, says a White House spokesman, applauded Boris Yeltsin's decision to go public with his heart surgery as ``a bold stroke that proved how important it [is] to be open about these sorts of situations.'' Apparently, since Clinton refuses to release <I>his</I> medical records, ``openness'' is only important in the Kremlin.

Using stealth technique to sign the Defense of Marriage Act did not keep Mr. Clinton off the gay community's radar screen. ACT-UP spokesman Steve Michael advised: ``Bill Clinton shouldn't be denigrating loving, committed gay relationships. He should be taking notes.''

<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT><font size=+1>N 1991</font>, with President George Bush still riding high, then-Sen. Al Gore announced he wouldn't make another bid for the Democratic presidential nomination -- partly because two years earlier his son had nearly died after being struck by a car. ``My family -- my wife and four young children -- are more important than politics and personal ambition,'' he avowed. Half a year later Gore's manifesto on the ecological crisis, <I>Earth in the Balance</I>, appeared -- also a result, he writes in the introduction, of his son's accident. The experience made him uncomfortable with the compromises and tawdriness of practical politics, ``increasingly impatient with the status quo, with conventional wisdom.'' By his own telling, Gore had been transformed into a politician of extraordinary virtue, willing to forsake ambition for his family, determined to embark on a quasi-spiritual crusade to save not just America or even democracy, but the planet.
<P>
Then, Bill Clinton called. Gore took the second spot on the ticket in 1992 and decided the wife and kids could wait while he spent his days disavowing the implications of <I>Earth in the Balance</I> in national debates and defending the compromises and tawdriness of the former Arkansas governor. Why the reversal? Well, it turns out, because his son had nearly died in a car accident. Accepting the vice-presidential nomination, Gore told the Democratic National Convention how immediately after the accident his son ``was limp and still, without breath or pulse.'' Gore was running for national office because, like his son, ``our democracy is lying there in the gutter, waiting for us to give it a second breath of life.'' His son's near-death, then, was now a kind of qualification for higher office. In fact, it seemed to be a justification for <I>anything</I>, a charm that Gore could rub whenever he needed an aura of virtue. 
<P>
Gore's father raised him to be President, and everything around him becomes automatically subsumed in the lifelong Al Gore for President campaign. His son's near death becomes a nice metaphor, his sister's painful, losing struggle with cancer a useful rhetorical riff, pandering and playing loose with the truth a necessary expedient (except when renouncing the same is even more expedient). And none of this is calculating or low because it is in the service of a goal whose purity is beyond reproach -- elevating Al Gore. The Vice President's reputation as a stiff at once underestimates him and gives him too much credit. Gore is disciplined and smart, at least an even match for his presumptive opponent in 2000, Jack Kemp. He is also, along with Hillary Clinton, today's foremost practitioner of the odious political style of the enlightened Baby Boomer, who assumes his own righteousness and considers any expedient justified in trying to visit it upon the nation.
<P>
Gore, a self-styled ``Son of the South,'' is really a Beltway baby. His father, Al Gore Sr., was a senator from Tennessee, and raised young Al in what is now the Ritz-Carlton hotel. He went to St. Albans, the exclusive prep school, and then on to Harvard, where, the joke goes, he studied Southern as a foreign language. His dad, meanwhile, got in trouble back home for his opposition to the Vietnam War. Al opposed the War, but volunteered to avoid embarrassing his father -- or, as the young Bill Clinton might have put it, to maintain his father's viability within the system. His dad lost anyway in 1970. Al supposedly soured on politics, but not enough to keep him from dropping his reporter job at a moment's notice six years later and running for an open congressional seat. He won the primary -- tantamount to election -- by 3,500 votes, the tightest race in his otherwise charmed political life. 
<P>
In the House and then in the Senate -- he won a Senate seat in 1984 -- Gore compiled a moderately liberal voting record (his Americans for Demo- cratic Action rating hovered around 70). As a congressman, he had a knack for grabbing headlines by championing goo-goo causes like nutritional standards for baby formula. In the Senate, GOP staffers still drip with contempt for him as ``a joke,'' who never matched his rhetoric with substance. He made his name on issues that, as Michael Kinsley has pointed out, were always ``difficult'' in the sense of being technical and dull, but not contentious. He became a student of the minutiae of arms control. He sponsored the Supercomputer Network Study Act. He, of course, talked about toxic waste. You can almost hear him thinking: ``Just don't make mistakes.'' It's an understandable impulse -- steer a safe course and graduate from Harvard, succeed  your daddy in the Senate, maybe even become President.
<P> 
The attitude suffused Gore's 1988 presidential bid, an exercise in ham-handed and utterly predictable cynicism. Gore ran at the urging of a group of wealthy Democrats who thought he could fill the ``moderate'' niche in the campaign. But his candidacy never developed a rationale. One of his first acts was to fly to Los Angeles with Tipper to tell music executives his wife didn't really mean the nasty things she had said about rock lyrics. Then he tried on successive campaign themes. The one he settled on was that he was the super-hawk in a field of liberal wimps, despite the fact that it was at odds with his record (votes against the Contras, against SDI, etc.). He wrote off Iowa, declaring, ``I will not barter my beliefs to win votes here or elsewhere,'' then went on to sell them wholesale anywhere he thought he might find a buyer. 
<P>
In Virginia, he visited a Norfolk shipyard to rap his opponents for wanting to cancel contracts for aircraft carriers there. Never mind that Gore had voted against $688 million in fiscal-1988 funding for those same carriers. After a disappointing showing in the Southern Super Tuesday primaries, he headed North, willing to try anything. In union-dominated Michigan he declared: ``I want to put the Democratic Party back on the side of working people.'' In Wisconsin he proposed a ridiculous hike in the dairy-support program that, by one estimate, would have cost consumers an extra forty cents a gallon. He even borrowed Dick Gephardt's economic-nationalist theme -- earlier he had been a critic -- when he vowed in an ad to ``make these corporations pay their share of taxes and create jobs here in America.'' In New York, finally, he became the candidate of Israel and Ed Koch, before his campaign at last was put out of its misery. 
<P>
In <I>Earth in the Balance</I>, published in early 1992, Gore pours some scorn, as well he might, on his 1988 bid. The book is self-flagellating and self-promoting all at once, and has a certain unhinged quality. Gore warns that we are at the ``edge of history,'' because ``[m]odern industrial civilization, as presently organized, is colliding violently with our planet's ecological system.'' So, he proposes nothing less than its complete re-organization. He rules out world government (sorry, just not practical), but not much else. He calls for a Global Marshall Plan. A Strategic Environment Initiative will phase out ``inappropriate technologies,'' including that pesky internal-combustion engine. A regime of taxes and regulations will make the environment a crucial factor in all economic decisions. Finally, binding international agreements will ensure that all nations stick with the program.
<P>
What got into Al Gore? There's still a Boy Scout feel to his advocacy. How can he get the most merit badges? By saving the planet. But Gore is also in the grip of a new idea: We're all inter-connected; our decisions affect other people; <I>there's an entire world outside Al Gore</I>! ``The search for truths about this ungodly crisis,'' Gore writes, ``and the search for truths about myself have been the same search all along.'' The book brims with amateur psychology. ``[W]e internalize the pain of our lost sense of connection to the natural world, we consume the earth and its resources as a way to distract ourselves from the pain, and we search insatiably for artificial substitutes to replace the experience of communion with the world that has been taken from us.'' Uh-huh. Gore's laments over our loss of connection with ourselves at times sound like a timid politician's cry for help.
<P>
The book marks a departure for Gore. Before, he could only muster his self-righteousness in the service of his ambition. Now he can do it for a cause, permitting him to go straight from smarmy politico to fanatic. With his repeated, sophomoric references to Nazism, he implies that those who don't share his views are not misguided, but evil. ``It is not merely in the service of analogy that I have referred so often to the struggles against Nazi and Communist totalitarianism,'' he writes, ``because I believe that the emerging effort to save the environment is a continuation of these struggles.'' Almost anything is justified in such a fight, and Gore makes it clear that science in particular shouldn't be allowed to stand in the way. He attacks Descartes and Bacon for laying the groundwork for the modern scientific revolution, and criticizes the notion that there ``can be a separation between facts and values, between the thoughts of a scientist and the moral duties of a human being.''

<font size=+3>G</font><font size=+1>ORE</font> has already struck blows for a science colored with his values. His Senate office was involved in an effort to discredit S. Fred Singer, a prominent skeptic about the greenhouse effect, after Singer published an article co-signed by Roger Revelle -- the father of global-warming theory and an inspiration to Gore --  suggesting that there wasn't evidence to justify radical actions to prevent global warming. Singer sued his chief critic, who had co-ordinated with Gore's office, for libel and won a public apology. Meanwhile, Bush appointee William Happer, the highly regarded director of research at the Department of Energy, was slated to stay on board after the 1992 election. But Happer, in internal discussions and congressional testimony, continued to discount global-warming alarmism and push for additional research before taking draconian action. One former Energy employee remembers a meeting where a high-ranking civil servant told Happer, ``I agree with you, Will, but I'd like to keep my job.'' Happer got the axe. 
<P>
Environmentalism has become de rigueur throughout the Administration. Warren Christopher recently declared that environmental issues would be a top priority of the <I>State Department</I>. It was a victory for Gore, whose most ambitious environmental project so far was the BTU energy tax, which took a drubbing in Congress in 1993. Other efforts to advance the green agenda have been similarly tempered by reality. ``Faced with an unresponsive Congress,'' says Jonathan Adler of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, ``Gore has provided an ideological rudder to ensure environmental initiatives still advance as far as possible.'' When the Administration developed a Climate Change Action Plan in 1993, environmentalists were angry that it didn't insist on mandatory caps on greenhouse emissions. In July the Administration decided it would push for just such caps, in another baby step on the way to the Global Marshall Plan.
<P>
<font size=+3>G</font><font size=+1>ORE</font> has also succeeded, thanks to his sheer relentlessness, in making himself a player in the Administration more broadly. He generally has pushed Clinton toward the center, urging him to produce a balanced budget by a date certain and sign welfare reform. His own moderate credentials have been burnished by his Reinventing Government (REGO) project, which is typical Gore: it has unobjectionable goals, involves a lot of technical details, and is much less than meets the eye. Savings have fallen far short of projections, while the project's vaunted personnel reductions are mostly a result of Defense Department downsizing. Besides, Gore's true loyalties are elsewhere. The Environmental Protection Agency's highly touted Project XL is supposed to be a model of chastened REGO-style regulation. But the state of Minnesota is already considering quitting the pilot program. One Dow Chemical official told <I>Chemical Week</I>, ``XL may be more cumbersome than the permitting process.''
<P>
But REGO is still a bragging point for Gore, as he runs simultaneously for Vice President this year and President in 2000. He's better on the stump than his reputation suggests, especially adept, as he demonstrated with his Macarena  dance in Chicago, at poking fun at himself. But he still can be flat. Before a Jewish group in New York City recently, he recited a speech in a monotone, occasionally inserting lengthy pauses between words for emphasis. Is this Al Gore delivering a speech or Al Gore pretending to be Al Gore delivering a speech? But a day later at the State University of New York at Albany he rallied a packed gymnasium of hyped-up students. They yelled, ``Do it!'', and ``Macarena!'' as soon as he came to the lectern. He pounded away at GOP education cuts, Medicare cuts, etc. He somehow took credit for the economic recovery and must have mentioned the phrase ``bridge to the future'' half a dozen times. It was a vague, slightly dishonest performance, totally lacking in content, exactly the kind of politics he attacked in <I>Earth in the Balance</I>.
<P>
It's too early to handicap the Democratic race in 2000, but Gore and Dick Gephardt are likely to be major contenders. Gore should occupy the center and try to tack left to pick up the party's special interests. Gephardt will do roughly the opposite. But neither is exactly a fresh wind in the party. The New Democrat movement, such as it is, has always been an outside force, hoping to overthrow the party's established order. Gore is at best an establishment fellow-traveler. The major debate among Democrats after 1996 will be whether Clinton's renewed popularity is a result of his move to the center or his defense of traditional government spending programs. Gore, who advocated both a balanced budget and standing firm against the GOP during the shutdowns, is well positioned to straddle the debate. Then, no doubt, he will work to make this accommodation seem a matter of high principle and courage. Dependent on his victory will be the nation's, nay the planet's, future. And, much more importantly, that of Al Gore.

<H2>Get Out The Hip-Hop Vote</H2></CENTER>

<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, AUGUST 21<br>


Two news releases advise us of current exercises in democratic practice. The first is an enterprise its sponsors call the ``hip-hop nation.'' It is specifically directed to ``keep African-Americans involved in American politics.''
<P>
Rock the Vote has joined with L.L. Cool J's Camp Cool Foundation and together they have created the Hip Hop Coalition for Political Change. The objective is young African-Americans and the design is to attract their attention in every city on the R. Kelley/L.L. Cool J tour, plus a series of television and radio public-service announcements ``featuring the likes of Will Smith, Kadeem Hardison, Coolio, Method Man, a reunited New Edition, Shai, Solo, Mokensteff, and many others.'' The coalition, reports Softline Information Inc.'s The Ethnic NewsWatch, ``plans to get the message out to the Black community that it's time to take part in the struggle and make a difference.''
<P>
Meanwhile, the <I>New York Times</I> informs us of the program of a nonprofit organization financed by the recording industry ``that revved up the youth vote in 1992.'' Rock the Vote has launched a service that will fill out voter-registration forms for callers who dial 800-REGISTER, or 800-734-4783.
<P>
Here is what you do. You dial the number and a voice asks you to tap in your zip code. A voice then reads to you the requirements of the state you live in (it is kindergarten work for a computer to deduce your state from your zip). You are then asked your name and date of birth.
<P>
You are then congratulated. In about ten days a completed form arrives in the mail. Rock the Vote even supplies the stamp. ``A new voter is born,'' the <I>Times</I> reports. One week before the election, the freshly registered voter will receive a postcard, reminding him to vote. The program, based in Santa Monica, California, hopes to register 500,000 new voters by September 10. The cost of the enterprise is borne by MCI, the communications company, in cooperation with MTV, the television station that features rock music and other saturnalia.
<P>
Now all of this has become possible owing to the national Voter Registration Act (the ``motor-voter law''). The idea (the Democrats', primarily) was to diminish the clerical burden on the voter. The Act specifies that states must accept voter-registration forms by mail. And further, that motor-vehicle departments, which is where practically everybody turns up at some point or another, must serve as registration agencies. Get a driver's license, register to vote.
<P>
The assumption, of course, is that an increase in the number of votes means a marginal increase in Democratic votes. This is quite obvious in the operation of the Hip Hop Coalition, inasmuch as it is explicitly directed to ``young African-Americans.'' Since American blacks vote over 90 per cent Democratic, it isn't likely that adding black votes will do other than enhance Democratic chances.
<P>
The Rock the Vote people aren't saying it in as many words, but you know, and I know, that the assumption is that MTV types will, without any interruption in rhythm, be attracted to free-form politics, in this case nicely summarized by the formula, A meets with B to decide how much C should give to D.
<P>
The get-out-the-vote fetishists are always declining to make the fundamental distinction, which is between voting for the commonweal, and voting for one's singular interests. It is certainly true that there is as high a percentage of rich people who vote for policies that favor rich people as of poor people who vote for policies that favor the poor. The rich farmer is likely to vote in favor of a continuation of subsidies, the poor farmer in favor of free health care. The moral tale could be lightly made if for instance after you dialed the 800 number and gave your date of birth the voice at the other end of the line were to say, in computer-tone:<br>
``That means, Mr. Squires, that you were 32 years old on your last birthday. Are you registering to vote for the first time? If so please record which of the following is the motivating impulse that brought you today to the phone, answer A, B, or C. a) I didn't know how to register until I saw this ad. b) I reflected that the time has come to do my civic duty. c) I want to vote for the party that's promising me higher wages/higher pension/better health-care benefits/higher tariffs.''
<P>
The caller is always free to hang up. Though maybe the next National Voter Register Act will make that illegal.

TRANSCRIPT EXTRACT: CAMPAIGN PHONE LINK.
<P> 
DATE: 9/22/96 BEGIN INTERCEPT: 11:19 A.M.
<P> 
STATIC. VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Rusty? Rusty, can you hear me?
<P>
STATIC. UNINTELLIGIBLE RESPONSE.
<P>
VPOTUS: Rusty?
<P>
STATIC. DEAD LINE.
<P>
VPOTUS: Damn satellite phones.
<P>
PHONE BEEPS. VPOTUS: Hello?
<P>
UNIDENTIFIED MALE VOICE: Who've I got here?
<P>
VPOTUS: This is Al Gore.
<P>
UNMALEV: Perfect. Just perfect. You with me?
<P>
VPOTUS: Who is this?
<P>
UNMALEV: Can't you recognize the voice? Thought my voice was more recognizable than the ears on my head. Perfect. This is beautiful. This is interesting. Can you follow me?
<P>
VPOTUS: Ross Perot?
<P>
UNMALEV: Got it right the first time. Now just let me finish. Will you let me finish? Hey, what's that clicking and whirring sound?
<P>
VPOTUS: It's my wife. She's on the plane with me. She's taking pictures for a new book.
<P>
UNMALEV: Huh. Isn't that interesting. I heard the same clicking and whirring during my daughter's wedding. Huh.
<P>
VPOTUS: How did you get this number, Ross?
<P>
HRP: Simplest thing in the world. Computers truly are the problem-solvers of our time. But I didn't get you on the blower to make your ears sweat. I want to know why you agreed to keep me out of the debates. Just give me a simple answer.
<P>
VPOTUS: Well, Ross --
<P> 
HRP: Will you let me finish? Can I finish here? Or is it just you talking and the American people wondering who lit the barn on fire and got the marshmallows out too late? Five Republicans and five Democrats got together and decided to keep me out of the debates and let me be completely clear with you -- okay? -- I have my home in Dallas and my children's homes under complete protection by a private group of security personnel and my wife and myself are wearing football helmets lined with tin foil -- so do not -- I repeat do not -- attempt to alter our behavior with rays or beams from space because it won't work.
<P>
VPOTUS: Ross, I assure you, if it was up to me, I'd let you in the debates.
<P>
HRP: Of course you would. When you and I went on ``Larry King'' to debate NAFTA, it was very clear to the viewers -- and I have had a team of experts from countries that were once members of the Soviet bloc analyze the tape -- that you were wearing a tiny device in your ear.
<P>
VPOTUS: I was, Ross. So were you. So was Larry. When you appear on television, the producers give you an earpiece so they can communicate with you from the booth.
<P>
HRP: Can I finish? I have been in business for forty years. I know how TV works. Now what you've just done is take a cat, skin it, put the skin on your head, and meow, okay?
<P>
VPOTUS: I beg your pardon?
<P>
HRP: You had an earpiece in the other earpiece and the White House was feeding you the answers.
<P>
VPOTUS: I resent that, Ross. I won that debate fair and square.
<P>
HRP: Now here's where it gets interesting. Okay? Let me simplify. And let me make it clear that the football helmets that my wife and I wear cannot be penetrated by thought waves, okay? Absolutely no thoughts can enter or exit.
<P>
VPOTUS: Ross -- 
<P>
HRP: I'm pulling out of the race.
<P>
VPOTUS: What?
<P>
HRP: Okay, I'm back in the race. The point is simple. I'm not stupid and neither are the American people. What are my chances in November?
<P>
VPOTUS: Honestly? Not good.
<P>
HRP: Okay. Now we've toasted the bread. Let's spread the peanut butter. Follow me. What if I promise not to go after Bill Clinton?
<P>
VPOTUS: What?
<P>
HRP: Still slow on the uptake, aren't you? Let's simplify. I run. I debate. Clinton wins. Okay?
<P>
VPOTUS: Okay.
<P>
HRP: Double-click on the year 2000. My guess is you want to be President.
<P>
VPOTUS: Well . . .
<P> 
HRP: Now I've got to wrap this up because it's hard to hear through the helmet. Here's what I'm saying. I would be honored if you would run in the year 2000 on the Reform Party ticket.
<P>
VPOTUS: What?
<P>
HRP: Think about it.
<P>
VPOTUS: Okay, but --
<P> 
HRP: Can I finish please? Can I please finish? I have to go. I'm going to debate a couple of empty chairs on ``Larry King.'' If they interrupt me as much as you have, this is going to get interesting.
<P> 
STATIC. END TRANSMISSION 11:35 AM.

In President Clinton's speech to the Democratic Convention -- which, for all we know, may still be going on as you read this -- he proposed ``to give businesses a tax credit for every person hired off welfare and kept employed,'' and ``to offer private job-placement firms a bonus for every welfare recipient they place in a job who stays in it.'' As a welfare reform, this proposal is pretty insignificant, but still wrongheaded: all previous efforts to provide benefits to recipients for getting off welfare have ended up persuading more people to get on it in the first place. But there's a more basic issue of fairness at stake here. Under this proposal, employers are encouraged to give greater consideration to welfare recipients than to job applicants who have ``worked hard and played by the rules.'' It is thus simply a surreptitious way of extending the existing regime of state-sponsored discrimination that goes by the name of ``affirmative action.'' This wouldn't go unchallenged if the Republican Party were still alive.

Sherry Rowlands meanwhile told the <I>Star</I> that Mrs. Clinton's address to the Democratic convention was a lot better than the original, oversweet draft that Dick Morris wrote. Hillary will be <I>so</I> pleased to hear it.

Ross Perot is pulling about 4 per cent in preference polls and airing 30-minute infomercials that are competing for the attention of 3 A.M. television viewers with ads for psychic phone consultations and 900-numbers. He stole the nomination of his own party, the presidential ``primary'' of which drew only 5 per cent of party members. His contribution to the policy debate consists mostly of rantings about Washington lobbyists, foreign trade, and a secret microphone in the Vice President's ear, not always in that order. He has now compounded his irrelevance by selecting as his running-mate Pat Choate, a Washington-based lobbyist for protectionism whose previous brush with destiny was as the ghostwriter of Perot's last book. Perot, in short, is a blight on American politics. For that reason -- and because he flunks the presidential debate commission's chief criterion of having a plausible chance at getting elected -- he should be kept as far from the debates as possible. The best forum for Ross Perot is the one he already has  -- the seedy reaches of late-night television.

In the last few days before adjournment, conservative senators are fighting with their own leadership to prevent the lifetime appointments of more Clinton judges to the federal bench. President Clinton has now appointed 26 per cent of all active federal judges, and GOP Senate leaders appear anxious to increase his judicial clout weeks before the election. Majority Leader Trent Lott permitted 17 district judges to be confirmed before the August recess, and Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch now wants to offer more Clinton appointees for expedited approval. Senators Kay Bailey Hutchison (Tex.), Jon Kyl (Ariz.), and Charles Grassley (Iowa) are to be commended for resisting this rush to judges.

Reality can no longer be satirized in the European Union. When EU foreign ministers met in Tralee, Ireland, on September 7 and 8, they disagreed totally over Iraq. London supported the U.S. raids unconditionally; Paris thoroughly disapproved. After which they reiterated their intention to write a common European foreign and security policy into a new treaty in 1997. But there are clear dangers in this process for the United States. Too divided to support the U.S. against Saddam Hussein, the EU is strangely united in its determination to defend the right of its businessmen to trade with Cuba, Libya, and Iran. Even a committed pro-European like Stuart Eizenstat was unable to change this on his recent mission. An integrated Europe increasingly governed by summiteers and independent central bankers will be both too cautious and too selfish to stand up for joint Western interests. More dangerous still: it is precisely because the Russians understand all this that they are in favor of a ``Europeanized'' (read: ``anti-American'') NATO. The U.S. must not continue to treat European integration with its customary benign neglect. What <I>kind</I> of Europe matters.

A key part of Ronald Reagan's legacy -- the National Endowment for Democracy -- is under attack once again on Capitol Hill. The Senate Appropriations Committee recently zeroed out its funding after the House had approved the Administration's request ($30 million, the same as current funding). Sen. Judd Gregg (R., N.H.) led the attack, arguing that ``the Cold War is over.'' He thus joins with those on the far Left who have sought the elimination of the NED since its creation in 1983. In fact, despite the collapse of the Soviet Union, two-fifths of the world's population still lives under autocratic rule, according to Freedom House. The NED has given aid and comfort to major democratic movements around the world, including Solidarity in Poland, Aung San Suu Kyi's party in Burma, and the Chinese human-rights movement -- and served U.S. interests in doing so. Its party-affiliated institutes may deserve some of the credit for Boris Yeltsin's defeat of the Communists in Russia --  not through the intervention of some last-minute self-promoting American consultants but through years of assistance to Russia's democrats and free-marketeers. The Senate should restore the NED's full funding in September when the appropriations bill reaches the floor.

October is Nobel Peace Prize season and Richard Holbrooke is waiting by his phone. The unraveling of his Dayton Accord on Bosnia may not be a disqualification --  after all, Ralph Bunche won the Prize for a fragile Arab -  Israeli armistice (one of many), and Le Duc Tho and Henry Kissinger shared it for a Vietnam agreement that didn't last long either. The Prize seems to be an ``A for Effort'' kind of thing. Holbrooke's was a valiant effort, though it was the climax of a badly flawed Clinton policy that ignored the real problem, namely an imbalance of military power that aided the Serb aggressors. Given the Norwegian Nobel Committee's often kinky tastes, however -- left-leaning groups are usually favored and Americans are usually shunned -- other candidates might be Greenpeace or the Mexican Zapatistas (with honorable mentions to Gerry Adams and the Unabomber). We could do much, much worse than Dick Holbrooke.

To most of America, the disingenuousness of tobacco-industry spokesmen is a cliche. To anti-smoking activists, it's a never-ending outrage. To lawyers suing cigarette manufacturers, it's a potentially lucrative tort. And to the U.S. Justice Department, it's a federal offense. The <I>Washington Post</I> reports that FBI agents are issuing grand-jury subpoenas to mid-level employees of Philip Morris and other tobacco companies, hoping that the threat of perjury charges will elicit testimony implicating senior industry officials in the crime of making false or misleading statements to Congress and federal agencies. This crime hinges mainly on whether tobacco-company executives are sincere when they suggest that smokers value nicotine for its taste, or when they insist, despite overwhelming evidence, that they personally do not <I>believe</I> that smoking causes lung cancer or that nicotine is addictive. Without getting inside their brains, we will never know for sure, but we can guess the answer. More to the point, no one is fooled by such legalistic evasions unless he wants to be. But the Justice Department has little faith in Americans' ability to see through transparent prevarications. As the Post notes, ``The tobacco industry has become an issue in the 1996 presidential campaign, with President Clinton positioning himself as the anti-smoking candidate.'' Yet ``Justice Department officials . . . say their probe is independent of White House influence.''

``I would kind of like to throw up in living color,'' said Rep. Pat Schroeder in reaction to the Morris scandal. Not to argue with your delicate sentiments, ma'am, but the contemporary term, coined by the great Australian comedian Barry Humphries, is ``a Technicolor yawn.''

President Clinton is proposing to bypass Congress and use the 1906 Antiquities Act to declare some 9,000 square miles of southern Utah a ``national monument'' in order to thwart a Dutch coal company from exercising its mining-lease rights to the Kaiparowits plateau, a remote sector of what they used to call ``badlands'' -- country so rocky and dry it was bypassed by cattlemen. Andalax Resources, Inc., discovered rich coal seams there and wants to open a mine based on leases granted in the mid 1980s. White House aides have said the Administration will not challenge Andalax's right to <I>mine</I> the coal but will deny it the permits needed to build roads to get the coal out. The <I>Washington Post</I> quoted a senior official as saying, ``The lease clearly conveys the right to explore for and develop and mine the coal. It doesn't say they necessarily have the right to get coal off the lease.'' File that under: ``What's a Constitution between friends?''

Mr. Clinton's ``bridge to the twenty-first century'' may sound like empty campaign rhetoric, but wait till you pay the toll.

 WASHINGTON, D.C.<br>
<FONT SIZE=+3>C</FONT><font size=+1>RITICS</font>   called the Republican National Convention an infomercial, but San Diego was amateur hour compared to the ``Listening to America'' forums Bob Dole is holding across the country. In Pittsburgh, a hundred invited guests sit in a warehouse belonging to Gamma Racquet Sports, Inc. -- the kind of small business Dole's economic plan is meant to help -- listening to Sen. Rick Santorum (R., Pa.) introduce the candidate. The fresh-faced, 38-year-old senator paces with a microphone, explaining what Bob Dole can do for you, right now, money-back guaranteed. He elicits tightly controlled bursts of applause straight from 2 A.M. television. The product could as easily be Frizz-Ease or the Ab-Master as a political program. Before it's over, you expect Richard Simmons to bounce out in skimpy purple shorts and hug the fattest guy who's in favor of a 50 per cent capital-gains tax cut.
<P>
Of course, the main attraction isn't the light-on-his-feet Simmons, but Bob Dole, who is anything but. Dole maneuvers through these forums like a high-wire act. He is up there, trying to connect, trying to listen to America, but will he trip? His wit plays well. After the owner of Gamma gives a glowing spiel about his company's tennis products, Dole deadpans: ``Nice racket you got here.'' Everyone laughs. Later, Dole interrupts a rambling questioner, with a smile, but a little snappish: ``What's your bottom line?'' Watch that edge, Bob. He goes on to explain why regulatory reform didn't pass -- ``We needed 60 [votes] to cut off the debate'' -- just bursting to say one of those incomprehensible process words: ``cloture.'' He resists. When a single mom tells how she couldn't get her small business off the ground, Dole begins his answer, ``There is a government program . . .'' No, Bob! Don't contradict your message by recommending government help! ``I know Rick would follow up as far as the SBA is concerned.''
<P>
Ahhh! But Dole quickly rights himself and talks about creating more private-sector opportunities again. He leaves the crowd of hand-picked Republicans impressed with his straightforwardness. When Dole made this early-September visit -- his third recent trip to Pennsylvania -- he brought a sharpened tax message. In his Saturday radio address, he told Americans how they are sending on average almost 40 per cent of their income to the government, as much as they spend on food, shelter, and clothing combined. He pounded the IRS, promising to ``end [it] as we know it,'' and spelled out how cutting just a small slice of federal spending -- some $10 trillion over the next six years -- would pay for the tax cut. He scores Clinton's alternative of ``targeted'' tax incentives as just another wat ``to dictate how you should spend'' your money.
<P>
It's as about as convincing on taxes as Dole is likely to get. The campaign realizes it has lost traction on the tax front -- polls show people by a narrow margin trusting Clinton more than Dole on the issue -- and it has to punch a message through with more immediacy for the average person. The campaign (or at least what seems to be the dominant faction at the moment) is convinced that one reason the plan hasn't taken off is that public awareness of it is still low. Hammering relentlessly on it in coming weeks -- with occasional jabs on an issue like drugs -- will boost those numbers, goes the theory, and inevitably Dole's overall numbers as well. The model is Christine Todd Whitman's New Jersey campaign in 1993, when a singleminded focus on taxes paid off, but only at campaign's end. So while all of GOP Washington panics at Clinton's renewed 15 - 20 point lead, the Dole campaign seems ready to stay the course.
<P>
There's no doubt Dole's tax plan still has untapped potential. The question is whether it has enough. The New Jersey model, for instance, has flaws. Christine Whitman benefited from a huge GOP get-out-the-vote effort, while incumbent Jim Florio, still suffering from lingering unpopularity, ignored his base. Dole, on the other hand, faces depressed GOP turnout and is squaring off against a President with nearly 60 per cent approval ratings. Dole is also trying to sell an economic message in an economy growing at a 4.2 per cent pace last quarter, with an unemployment rate at its lowest in seven years. It's an indication of how hard the GOP has to stretch for bad news that the RNC recently issued a press release on declining construction spending. On the social front -- fertile ground for the GOP -- Dole has been disarmed by both the GOP Congress, which kicked away issues like crime, and Dick Morris, who helped the President snatch them up. 
<P>
Dole is left half a candidate. In a packed gym at the University of Scranton, he is greeted by an enthusiastic, sweaty throng of more than a thousand locals and pompom-waving students as the sound system blasts jazzy riffs from the Blues Brothers sound-track. Dole keeps up the energy with slashing and amusing attacks on Clinton on taxes, which go on for perhaps a bit too long. Then what? He talks about drugs. The Dole campaign swears this is a cutting issue, particularly with women; focus groups of 15 women sympathetic toward Clinton will reportedly leave after hearing the drug message loathing the President. But the crowd in the gym isn't particularly moved; drugs is simply not a defining issue. Can Dole get mileage from it? ``If they can prove the President is on drugs now,'' says political analyst Stuart Rothenberg, ``they may have a chance.''
<P>
But Dole still has an energetic crowd when he moves to his speech's close. ``Let me just say this,'' Dole intones, a bleacher full of students yelling behind him. ``This is America, the greatest country on the face of the Earth.'' It's an utterly banal line. But there's still something moving about it from Dole -- he means it, and proved it somewhere in Italy fifty years ago. This, then, is where Dole can close the deal, making up for his charisma gap with an emotional evocation of his small-town life and service to country. But Dole keeps stepping on the mood. When he mentions Russell, Kansas, he motions to fellow Russell native Sen. Arlen Specter (R., Pa.), on the stage with him: ``Arlen and I grew up there little different times. He's much, much younger . . . But nobody gets old there. But, in any event . . .'' Then Dole says he ``wasn't born with this suit on.'' Well, he pauses: ``Come to think of it I wasn't born with any suit on.''
<P>
Dole seems emotionally incapable -- except in rare instances -- of playing on his past effectively. The asides and quips always distance himself from himself. The problem isn't that Dole is too hardened or bitter really, but that he's too brittle. Watching him, in front of the Pittsburgh forum, standing with his arms crossed, his left hand holding what seems to be an almost empty right sleeve, brings home again the grievous nature of Dole's wound. There's a vulnerability to him. Dole choked up during his convention speech just saying he loved his father. To his eternal credit, it would simply be impossible for him to make the excruciatingly managed play on emotion of Al Gore talking about his sister. Dole, beneath it all, is a man of such deep feelings that they aren't readily available for manipulation, a fact that contributes to his image as the candidate of coldness.
<P>
Which in turn contributes to his poor showing among women. The campaign considers the conservative base locked up with the tax plan and the choice of Kemp as VP, and is concentrating on re-capturing women and GOP moderates. The focus on jobs and small business is considered attractive to women, increasingly the owners of small start-ups. Drugs, again, are considered a women's issue. So is education, a topic Dole treats well on the stump: he asks rhetorically why all parents in America shouldn't have the same ability as the President to send their children to private schools, and he shellacs the teachers' unions. The real danger of Dole's play for moderates is that it scares the campaign off the kind of wedge issues that polarize the electorate along liberal - conservative lines and send ``Reagan Democrats'' scurrying to the GOP.
<P>
The issue of race preferences is the foremost example. The Dole campaign doesn't think it polls well. And it is afraid of the issue's ``volatility.'' But when you're 15 points behind, volatility is a good thing: stock-market crashes, hostage crises -- bring them on! More fundamentally, the preference issue goes to the half of the campaign that has been missing so far. Dole's best-received non-tax line on the stump is when he vows that he, not Boutros Boutros-Ghali, will make decisions about committing U.S. troops to combat. Sound familiar? It's a straight lift from Pat Buchanan. Dole has adopted the Steve Forbes line on taxes; now he needs Buchanan's on the social issues (or at least Gingrich's circa 1994). With crime and welfare essentially neutralized, Dole can still talk about multiculturalism, bilingual education, illegitimacy, and even abortion to get to the differences between the parties. In Scranton, for the first time since his nomination, Dole hit on partial-birth abortion; he did it only after prodding by Senator Santorum on the trip from Washington, but it was a step toward appealing to Catholic swing voters. 
<P>
Dole needs them desperately if he is going to negotiate a tough-looking  electoral map. His aides figure he has to win everything from Idaho east to Minnesota, with the exception perhaps of Montana and New Mexico. Then he has to sweep the South, with the exception of Louisiana and Arkansas, but definitely including Georgia, Tennessee, and Kentucky (Clinton states in 1992). Only then can Dole afford to lose California and almost all of the Northeast. The key battleground states would be Pennsylvania (where he is down by 14 points), New Jersey (down by 13), Ohio (down by 6), Michigan (down by 10), and Iowa (down by 14). Any Dole strategy looks like a fairy tale as long as he is 15 points behind nationally, with even must-win Florida breaking for Clinton. But the campaign takes solace in the fact that twice in the campaign -- once in June, once in August after the GOP convention -- Clinton's big lead collapsed. That is evidence, they maintain, that when voters truly focus on their choice, it's a tight race.
<P>
<font size=+3>T</font><font size=+1>HE</font> question is whether they will ever again get the focus they want. In Pittsburgh, Dole had just zipped off a line about the teachers' unions, when right outside the door of the warehouse a cargo train began to rumble by on a railroad bridge. It made it hard to hear, as car after car rolled by. Here was Dole, standing with a microphone, just a man, again getting drowned out by forces beyond his control: whether it's the White House unblinkingly selling Clinton as a conservative, or an economy humming along nicely, or, in the previous week, the missile attack on Iraq, or just a day earlier, Hurricane Fran. Dole handled the situation well: ``That's the bridge to the future,'' he said, gesturing outside the door, ``more taxes, more drugs, etc.'' The crowd laughed, but the symbolism seemed -- appropriately enough -- pretty ominous.
<P>
The Dole campaign, despite everything, recently contacted Ed Meese for advice on putting together a presidential transition. Give Dole credit: maybe he really is the most optimistic man in America.

September 7, 1996
<P>
Dear Rusty,
<P>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->


<BR>
<BR>
<P>




It's been a heck of a week. In the first place, I'm still dealing with a lot of the emotional issues that have recently surfaced in my life -- things I've kept pretty well hidden deep in my heart. You know me, Rusty -- I'm a heart-on-my-sleeve kind of guy; I can't hide my emotions. And yet, somehow, some way, from 1988 to 1996 I campaigned in the South as a friend to the tobacco farmer, a supporter of the tobacco industry, a tobacco farmer myself -- all the while internally grieving for my sister who died of lung cancer in 1984. 
<P>
Psychologists call it ``delayed grief transference syndrome,'' and what it means, basically, is that sometimes it takes a big jolt to wake yourself up -- a jolt like realizing that Pennsylvania, Ohio, California, and Illinois don't have any tobacco farmers. You've got to look squarely at an electoral map before the healing can really begin. 
<P>
And then we had the Dick Morris thing, which is really too sordid to go into here. Suffice it to say that it turns out that Morris had a girlfriend, a mistress, and an illegitimate daughter. 
<P>
Lucky for us, Bill and HRC took it all pretty calmly. They go back a long way with Dick, so a lot of it probably didn't shock them. 
<P>
Immediately after we got word that Dick had received a $2.5-million advance from Random House for his memoirs, HRC baked a big batch of brownies and made a giant homemade card that we all had to sign. ``Congratulations, Dick! Our Little Boswell! With Best Wishes!'' was emblazoned on the front. I'm sure Dick appreciated it, but under the circumstances, it was an odd gesture. 
<P>
And later, I thought it was weird when they asked us to get on the phone with them last night, so we could all sing ``For He's a Jolly Good Fellow'' to Dick. After we finished singing -- and there were a lot of us crowded around the phone: me, Tip, HRC, Bill, Leon Panetta, George Stephanopoulos, Bob Rubin, and Mike McCurry -- I made the mistake of wishing Dick a happy birthday. It turns out it wasn't his birthday after all. We were singing because, as HRC said, ``It's Dick's favorite song.'' When I pointed out that my favorite song is ``Do You Know Where You're Going To/Love Theme from `Mahogany''' and that no one had ever sung it over the phone to me, all HRC said was, ``You don't have a book contract.'' 
<P>
A few days later, Bill launched an attack on Iraq. And a few days after that, we had a 20-point lead! 
<P>
The only problem is recapturing the House and Senate. In the first place, the pattern of retirements in the Senate is against us. And in the second place, the House races seem unlikely to be influenced by our campaign. 
<P>
But can I be honest with you, Rusty? I'm not all that disappointed. I'm thinking a lot about the future, Rusty, and I've got to admit that future includes a run for the Presidency in '00, and when I called the Des Moines TraveLodge yesterday to reserve 25 rooms and the Corn Cob Convention Room for February '00, well, guess what? Dick Gephardt had already reserved them! Ditto the Granite State Motor Inn in Manchester, New Hampshire. So now I'm stuck with the Ottumwa SleepyDaze as my Iowa headquarters and the MinuteMan Zzzs-4-Less in New Hampshire. So excuse me if I don't break my neck campaigning for Speaker Gephardt. 
<P>
Tonight, as we were all in the Oval Office coloring a big ``We Love You, Dick!'' banner, the conversation drifted to the latest Time magazine cover -- it features Dick and his wife looking glum and haggard. The banner we were working on was supposed to cheer them up. HRC was going to have the Marines fly it up to Connecticut in a C-class helicopter and then just sort of buzz around for a few hours with it flapping away. ``If he gets writer's block or something he can just look up and see this happy banner and then maybe he'll want to write happy things,'' she said. 
<P>
``Here's what I don't understand,'' I said. ``He cheats on his wife, he humiliates her in public, he's famous for having no real scruples or steadfast beliefs, he's liberal when it suits him and conservative when it suits him . . . I mean, what can you do with a man like that? Why would you stay married to him?'' 
<P>
Just then, Bill re-entered the room from another bombing raid. ``Hey!'' he cried happily. ``We're up 26 points in California!'' 
<P>
HRC looked at me. ``That's why,'' she said. ``Sometimes it's worth it.'' 
<P>
I'm not sure it is, Rusty. But then, my judgment is clouded. I'm still suffering delayed grief transference syndrome. I'm due in California tomorrow and it's coming on strong. Wish me the best.

The media, quick to point out an alleged ``shortage'' of women and minorities at the Republican Convention, missed a more interesting story at the Democratic Convention -- the blatant resort to quotas in the selection of delegates. Democratic National Committee rules forbid ``mandatory quotas,'' and Bill Clinton repeatedly proclaims his opposition to them. Yet the 1996 Delegate Selection Rules require all state parties to adopt ``specific goals and timetables'' ensuring that each delegation exactly matches the Democratic electorate in the state in terms of color and sex. Rigid mathematical models and formulas are spelled out, and penalties ensue for any shortfall. As the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> points out, the result is a revealing gloss on how a re-elected Clinton Administration is likely to interpret its ``opposition'' to quotas.

John Cardinal O'Connor has disinvited Bill Clinton from the prestigious Al Smith dinner because of the President's support of partial-birth abortions. Such an unprecedented snub of a sitting President powerfully communicates the depth of the Catholic bishops' outrage. But Cardinal O'Connor diluted that message by not inviting Bob Dole either, in order to avoid charges of partisanship. Jack Kemp and Al Gore have been invited in the presidential nominees' places. The plain, if unwelcome, fact is that one party's ticket sided with the angels on this issue, and another's didn't. On partial-birth abortion, the President hasn't let squeamishness alter his course. Neither should Cardinal O'Connor.

Congressional Republicans have refused to touch the issue of race preferences over the last year. No longer. If the House passes the version of the Federal Aviation Authorization Act of 1996 just endorsed by the House Transportation Committee, Republicans will finally take on the issue of quotas -- by re-authorizing one of the Federal Government's more egregious set-aside programs. The act requires that every airport applying for federal funds under the Airport Improvements Program guarantee that 10 per cent of firms doing business at the airport are minority owned. This has led to absurdities such as rental-car companies being forced to buy 10 per cent of their tires from minority firms. It also is plainly unconstitutional under the Supreme Court's <I>Adarand</I> decision. But airport bills are full of pork-laden goodies for nearly everyone, so the Transportation Committee likes to see them pass on big bi-partisan votes -- even if it means winking at the worst sort of racial bean-counting. The House leadership will end the practice, if it has a sufficient quota of courage.

At a morning meeting the first day of the Democratic National Convention, officials of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council bragged of having won the battle for the mind of their party. They can indeed point to a platform that studiously avoids leftist rhetoric and a President who, post 1994 at least, has regularly filched Republican issues. These victories are only provisional, however, as long as the muscles and tendons of the Democratic Party remain so dominated by the Left. While ``New Democrats'' trooped to the podium in the convention hall, in the streets and meeting halls elsewhere around town activists celebrated the old faith -- from AFL - CIO chairman (and Democratic Socialist) John Sweeney denouncing the ``evil'' of Newt Gingrich at an afternoon ``America Needs a Raise'' rally, to the National Education Association caucusing with top Democrats at the downtown Hyatt. All that holds the party together now is the sheer will to retain power. That, and not New Democrat centrism or any other ideological concoction, is what motivates today's Democratic Party. A DNC T-shirt says it all -- ``Win in '96,'' which is what must pass for uplift in Chicago. The last time Democrats met in the Windy City, there was talk of a ``New Politics'' of moral commitment and idealism. Chicago 1996 is about the triumph of the old politics, winning at all costs.

Mr. H. Ross Perot, who a year ago said he would rather perform brain surgery on himself than get back into presidential politics, likes to regard himself as George Washington II, and has enough money to buy either major party, is ``accepting'' nearly $30 million in federal election funds for his Reform Party. Or to put it more plainly, he's sticking it to taxpayers. If this is his idea of ``reform,'' he's overdue for that brain surgery.

Maybe Republicans should be happy the press didn't provide more coverage of the San Diego convention. Take the abortion controversy. Reporter after reporter explained that the Republican platform calls for a ban on all abortions. The platform's actual language -- ``we support a Human Life Amendment to the Constitution and we endorse legislation to make clear that the Fourteenth Amendment's protections apply to unborn children'' -- is silent on the issue of exceptions. ``It's a statement of principle, it's not a legislative document,'' explains Mike Russell, a Christian Coalition spokesman. The constraints of space, time, and audience attention often make it hard to convey the nuances of a story; but given the vast amount of media attention to abortion, it's puzzling why this error has become a hardy perennial of reporting on the issue. News accounts of the struggle over Dole's proposed ``declaration of tolerance'' were more accurate, but still misleading. They left the impression that all ``tolerance language'' had been stripped out of the platform. In fact, the platform refers three times to legitimate differences of opinion among Republicans: in the preamble (``In one way or another, every Republican is a dissenter''), in the statement of principles (``Because Americans are a diverse and tolerant people, they have differences of opinion on many issues''), and in the opening of the section which deals with abortion and other issues of individual rights and personal safety (``We are the party of the open door,'' etc.). By ignoring the more generic statements of tolerance, they misled viewers through omission. And Howell Raines, the <I>New York Times</I>'s editorial-page editor, provided the most mischievous free advice of the convention. Colin Powell ``could be a more serious force if he set out to rally Republican voters to take back the party from its convention zealots.'' In other words, the GOP's most popular figure should declare war on the party's base in the middle of an election year. And if liberal Democrats should benefit from this fratricide, well, that's OK too.

Bob Dole, it is said, is being whipped by President Clinton on the smoking issue. But nothing so dramatizes the Republican theme of an overbearing, blundering Federal Government as Clinton's policy toward tobacco. As it happens, his latest move -- to authorize the Food and Drug Administration to regulate the sale and advertising of tobacco products -- looks like a blunder indeed, because it commits the government to a protracted court battle with the tobacco industry that the industry will almost certainly win. Tobacco products simply don't fall within the purview of the FDA: the law gives the FDA jurisdiction only over pharmaceutical drugs, and all the elaborate regulations the FDA is likely to produce will in time be declared unconstitutional. FDA chief David Kessler knows that. But he doesn't care, wanting to use the interim period to speak to the nation as the President's anti-smoking czar. When Dole last got onto the smoking issue, he made the mistake of speaking off the cuff and then getting angry with lovable girl-next-door Katie Couric. He should choose his forum more carefully and then make the common-sense case that tobacco smoking is a pleasure which does entail a health risk, but that it is a matter of individual choice for adults whether or not they smoke: it is not a matter for Federal Government grandstanding and empire-building. Dole can legitimately warn against the Naderite zealots at the FDA who want to impose tobacco prohibition.

<I><b>NR</b></I> has suspected from the beginning that the political provisions of the Dayton Accords -- the noble blueprint for a unitary, multi-ethnic Bosnia -- might prove unattainable. Sure enough, the Bosnian elections scheduled for September 14 look to be a great disappointment, even a setback, rather than a boost toward stable democracy. There are charges of massive vote-rigging by Serbs in contested areas over which they seek to tighten their grip; in none of the rival communities is there a great predilection for democratic procedures. The deeper problem, however, is not the vote manipulation but the consolidation of partition. (``Electoral cleansing,'' <I>The Economist</I> dubs it.) The Serb and Croat populations have made clear (in U.S. Information Agency opinion polls) that they yearn for partition. For Bill Clinton, Dayton has already served its purpose of putting Bosnia on ice until our election is past. But whoever is President next year will face an unholy mess.

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has ruled that Bruce Anderson, the vegetarian in California who refused to give children on his school bus coupons for free hamburgers, was wrongfully fired. Anderson cited religious reasons for not doing his job, and the EEOC apparently agreed, setting the stage for a constitutional crisis of the first magnitude.

Does mere Christianity have the same standing under the law (EEOC law anyway) as vegetarianism? Ask yourself what would happen to a school-bus driver who, contrary to job instructions, passed out invitations to go to Holy Communion.

 WASHINGTON, D.C.<br>
<FONT SIZE=+3>"I</FONT><font size=+1>T ALL</font>  began with Buckley's column,'' said Jack Kemp at the NATIONAL REVIEW - GOPAC party on Monday night of convention week in San Diego. The column he was referring to, ``The Kemp Manifesto,'' had run on June 21. In it, Buckley called on Bob Dole to adopt some suggestions on welfare and economics that Kemp had made in an essay in the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>. But Buckley ended by proposing ``a second, equally exciting move'': that Dole ``name Jack Kemp as vice-presidential candidate.''
<P>
WFB has recommended running-mates before, not always with success: in 1964 he advised Barry Goldwater to tap former President Dwight Eisenhower. This June, offering Kemp as Dole's running-mate seemed scarcely more likely. By now, all the newspapers in America have replayed the long volley of gibes between the two men, going back to the intraparty supply-side wars of the early Eighties: quarterbacks playing without helmets; the fire in Dole's library; the bus that went over the cliff. Dole had made a rapprochement of sorts last year when he and Newt Gingrich picked Kemp to chair a party commission on tax reform (or was it a sop?). Then Kemp seemed to blow it all sky high this spring with his last-minute endorsement of Steve Forbes, on the eve of the New York primary. On top of their policy and political quarrels, Kemp and Dole looked at each other across a gulf of temperament. On the plains where he came from, Dole would say in his acceptance speech, ``a man is very small -- and if he thinks otherwise, he is wrong.'' In the locker rooms where he came from, Kemp used to say and has been saying ever since: ``Be a leader!''
<P>
By 1996 Kemp was estranged not only from the pragmatic Dole but from the conservative movement. His years as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development were marked by questionable policy and effusive rhetoric. Meanwhile, the article of Eighties orthodoxy to which he remained conspicuously faithful -- tax-rate cuts -- was being abandoned by the deficit hawks of the 104th Congress. In July, Kemp told Gingrich at a dinner that no one in the GOP was listening to him any more.
<P>
So adrift was Jack French Kemp that, just before San Diego, he called California Attorney General Dan Lungren and asked if the Lungrens wanted to have dinner with the Kemps Wednesday of convention week. Kemp had no plans.
<P>
Then the call came, and for the next ten weeks at least, Kemp's life will be entirely planned. It was the Great Gatsby meets the Grand Old Party. Kemp had decided not to run for the presidential nomination in this cycle because he dislikes raising money. Now, without raising a dime, he had landed the nomination next door. A man who at the age of 61 had seen his career run deep down into the ground, found himself raised up, not by a loyal friend, but by an old enemy. Who says there are no second acts in American lives?
<P>
Kemp's acceptance speech was fine cheerleading, and classic Kemp. Time has whitened his thatch and thickened his waist, but he still clatters the way he did in 1978. There was inclusiveness: ``From the boroughs of New York to the barrios of California, we're not going to leave anyone out of this campaign. . . . Our appeal of boundless opportunity crosses every barrier of geography, race, and belief. [By definition, since it is boundless.]'' Tablet-keeping: ``Communism came down, not because it fell, but because he pushed it. Thank you, Ronald Reagan.'' Capitalist theology: ``In our work . . . we discover that part within ourselves that is divine. . . . Growth and opportunity . . . advance human dignity.'' Problems: The economy ``is moving like a ship dragging an anchor.'' Solutions: We will ``cut the capital-gains tax in half and not apologize for it.'' Optimism: ``Americans do not accept limits. We transcend limits.'' More optimism: ``It is 1776 all over the world.'' Bob Dole, by the conclusion of his own acceptance speech, had brought himself to assert that he was ``the most optimistic man in America.'' Think otherwise -- there is at least one man ahead of him.
<P>
We can assume that two Republicans in San Diego were secretly displeased with the Kemp pick, not so much for 1996 as for 2000. One would be Pat Buchanan. As several of his supporters reminded me -- more in sorrow, it must be said, than in anger -- Kemp had announced back in February, when Buchanan was riding high, that he could not support a ticket headed by Pat. Buchanan has endorsed the Dole - Kemp ticket now. But he has been calling Kempery ``Big Rock Candy Mountain'' conservatism since the late Eighties. If Kemp should get the top spot in 2000, Buchanan will have ample reason to walk. The other future malcontent would be Colin Powell. In one stroke, Kemp's eager acceptance of Dole's offer made the much-wooed general's unwillingness to take the same slot seem like irrelevant shallying. Kemp is the Happy Warrior, Powell has become the Smug Noncombatant.
<P>
If Dole calculated that picking Kemp would give him a lift, he calculated right. It was more than just a charisma transplant, or an age balance (Kemp is only 12 years younger than Dole, but he will seem youthful if he lives to be 100). It was a statement, by Dole, of his own intentions. The Kemp pick showed that Dole's tax plan, unveiled days earlier, was a serious thrust, not a feint. Dole had decided to put his eggs in the basket of supply-side economics. Enemies could charge him with inconsistency. Supporters could say that he displayed a Majority Leader's knack for sensing political realities. Whatever the reason, the tax plan and running-mate together brought the party into alignment like a magnet under a paper covered with iron filings. Without the one - two punch, the whole convention, from the Powell speech, to Mrs. Dole's walkabout, to the endless parade of the lame and the halt, to Mark Helprin's well-chosen words, would have seemed a lot more patched-up than it did.
<P>
What about other issues? Abortion was hardly mentioned in San Diego. But Kemp has been pro-life all his career, and he raised the issue himself two days after the convention ended at a rally in Pittsburgh. ``Wherever you stand on the issue of abortion . . . I can't imagine our nation being that city on a hill if we continue to allow the partial-birth abortion tragedy in the United States of America. We're not out to preach. We're out to persuade the American people there is something at stake here . . .'' Focusing on partial-birth abortions stops well short of the GOP's call for a right-to-life amendment, of course. But that hasn't gone anywhere for 16 years. Maybe it's time for pro-lifers to try salami tactics.
<P>
Two issues that have come to the fore since Kemp rose to prominence have been harder to finesse. In 1994 the California ballot contained Proposition 187, the initiative which sought to deny a variety of public benefits to illegal aliens. Kemp campaigned against it, both before and after it passed. ``In my view, that is not what America is all about. . . . I'm speaking from the heart, not politically.'' No kidding. On convention Tuesday, the <I>Los Angeles Times</I> ran a blunt letter, signed by Thomas P. Logan, treasurer of the Concerned Citizens Committee, arguing that Dole's selection of Kemp ``cost him any chance of winning California. . . . Kemp's open opposition to Prop. 187 . . . is still fresh in the minds of many California voters.'' The next day, a more political Kemp told a meeting of the California delegation that ``we have the right to have a sovereign border. We must close the door of illegal immigration so we can keep the front door of legal immigration open.'' Does ``sovereign border'' mean denying benefits? Kemp has said yes, though he has also said he does not want to turn California ``into a police state.'' In any case, he disagrees with Dole's desire, expressed in Congress if not on the campaign trail, to lower legal immigration.
<P>
Kemp has also urged Republicans in recent years not to make affirmative action a warhead issue, lest it give the appearance of racial politicking. So the Kemp pick seemed at first to be a blow to supporters of the California Civil Rights Initiative, or Proposition 209. But Kemp told the California delegation, in the same appearance in which he endorsed border sovereignty, that ``we've got to bring this country together. We can't be divided by class, as the Clinton Administration [and] race-based quotas do.'' Meanwhile, Ward Connerly, chairman of the drive for CCRI, said he had been talking with Kemp ``for about five months. He has always said he is opposed to quotas and preferences. We had to make the case that there were quotas and preferences'' in California.
<P>
Kemp's fundamental problem was evident in the very <I>Wall Street Journal</I> essay which Buckley praised. In it, Kemp called for indexing the capital-gains law, and tying the dollar to a somewhat elastic gold standard. In return for these reforms, he suggested that the Republicans abandon attempts to change welfare. No more wrangles over poverty or taxes; the rising tide will float us all. Kemp ignores, or rejects, the arguments that the welfare system is personally crippling -- that it creates a trap which incentives, however rich, fail to lure people from.
<P>
And so on, almost down the line. Kemp seems incapable of realizing how hard citizenship, civilization, life itself can be. The comment that it is 1776 ``all over the world'' is a fantasy. It could only have been made by someone with no grasp of what a damned close-run thing 1776 was right here: not so much because of enemy power, as because of our own fecklessness, rigidity, sloth. Growth, opportunity, and work are not the only measures of dignity or divinity. In order for opportunity to flourish, it has to be sustained by a web of habits, prohibitions, and prejudices. These in turn always require the support of custom, sometimes of law. When it is a question of the right to life, Kemp sees the need for something beyond the growth mantra (why not support partial-birth abortions, like that good tax-cutter, Gov. Christine Whitman?). On other questions, he is too busy being optimistic.
<P>
Optimism isn't sufficient, but it's necessary, and the Dole campaign wasn't showing much until it brought Kemp aboard. We're in for a lively ride.

<H2>Understanding The Welfare-Reform Bill</H2></CENTER>

<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, AUGUST 2
<P>














Really, the Newspaper of Record leaves us with the impression that the welfare-reform bill is a declaration of war against the State of New York. There were two front-page stories in the <I>New York Times</I> on Thursday. The first by Robert Pear led, ``After hours of suspense and soul-searching, President Clinton said today that he would sign a bill that reverses six decades of social-welfare policy and touches the lives of tens of millions of people.'' And, alongside, from David Firestone, ``President Clinton's decision yesterday to transform the nation's welfare system left both local officials and welfare advocates gasping at the enormous new costs of public assistance they say will have to be borne by city and state taxpayers.'' 
<P>
And those were mere whispers, auguring the roars of pain and indignation and doom talk from such as Mayor Giuliani and Representative Rangel. And then it was discovered that the New York State Constitution ``guarantees'' relief payments to all its residents on welfare. How will we make these payments? Mayor Giuliani told the press the estimated increase in cost to New York City would be $720 million, and so the city's situation is that general revenues are predicted to increase by 0.3 per cent, but expenditures must now increase by 2 per cent.
<P>
Begin with some elementary mathematics. 
<P>
 -- In 1994 New York State paid to Washington, D.C., $1.26 for every dollar New York received from Washington.
<P> 
 -- That being so, a reduction of one dollar in expenditures by Washington means a reduction in levies on New York of $1.26. 
<P>
 -- Therefore, if New York quite simply took over the welfare burden now handled by Washington, the out-of-pocket cost to New Yorkers would be reduced, not augmented. 
<P> 
 -- About thirty states in the Union receive more money from Washington than they pay out to Washington. If there is cause for concern at a dollar-by-dollar level, it is a concern of those states.
<P>
 -- The thinking behind welfare reform is that welfare payments will decrease, not increase, when the plan takes hold. That reasoning is to some extent speculative, but its basis is experience. Senator Phil Gramm points out that we have spent over $2 trillion on welfare in the past thirty years, and poverty has increased. Most especially, illegitimacy has increased, which is the primary generator of poverty. 
<P>
 -- But of course devolution, which is what this bill is all about, does not lay a hand on the freedom of state legislators to re-enact welfare in the old mode, except that financing will have to come from Albany, not from Washington. This means that Sacramento and Albany are free to choose divers approaches to welfare problems.
<P> 
 -- Senator Moynihan, as often happens, had the most original thoughts on the subject. He began by calling everyone who voted in favor of welfare reform insane (``It is a social risk that no sane person would take . . .''). But he wished to distance himself from the cant-talk of fellow liberals. ``For years, whenever the critics said, correctly, that the welfare system was doing more harm than good, and suggested that it be rethought, its defenders screamed 'racism' and 'slavefare.' They did that until there was no public support left at all. Now they are stunned at what they're getting.'' He went on to name Professor James Q. Wilson of UCLA and John DiIulio of Princeton and William Bennett of Washington as prominent welfare skeptics. ``Typically liberals think otherwise, to the extent that liberals can be said to think at all.'' I wish I had said that. 
<P>
But it is indeed an important moment in American history precisely because it asks the fifty states to take on substantial responsibility for exploring more effective means than we have come up with for helping our forlorn and our wayward. In order to do this, the objective of the individual state has to be to arrest the rate of illegitimacy. The means of achieving this end have been exhaustively explored in this space. The only systematic attention given to the problem has been by the scholarly Charles Murray, and his conclusions are harmonious with those provisions of the welfare-reform bill that stress the desirability of work. (Individual states can waive this requirement, but not with federal money.) And then -- a correlative objective? -- we need to free up education, to encourage learning and skills. We know how to do this, but the First Amendment, as interpreted, has got to cooperate.

Dear Rusty,
<P>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->


<BR>
<BR>
<P>


We're back!
<P>
Back on the campaign, back on the Big Bus, back doing what we do best: talking in outdoor settings and appearing in television commercials!
<P>
I'm sitting in my hotel suite at the Drake Hotel in Chicago, I've eaten all the raisins out of the mini-bar, and I'm working on my speech to the convention. Everyone's expecting a real Gore-style barnburner, and I can't let them down. In the middle section of my speech, around page 73, I'm going to try to get the convention hall going in a big chant: ``2.3% Reduction in CAF Standards for the Year 2000!'' And later: ``We turned back the clock on topsoil erosion!''
<P>
Get ready to stamp your feet!
<P>
Tipper's asleep on my shoulder. She's been helping me edit my remarks all nightewhat a trouper! Since I've got to get the preliminary draft over to Dr. Morris by tomorrow morning -- something about ``fine tuning the code'' -- I've really got to finish it tonight, and Tip's been very helpful.
<P>
Near the end of the speech, around page 137, I take a swipe at Jack Kemp. ``The vice-presidential nominee of the other party,'' I say, ``wants to bring us back to the gold standard. And you know what that means. More strip mining!''
<P>
Tipper suggested that I cut that part out, but I told her that the American people only fear what they don't understand, and as I went through it with her, she drifted off on my shoulder.
<P>
I'm expecting big-time cheers!
<P>
This whole campaign has me energized like never before, Rusty. I'm giddy.
<P>
First, Bill and I are finally getting to do more stuff together. Rusty, those early days of our administration were great for our friendship. But I've got to admit that as time went on, little things crept in to keep us apart. Our regularly scheduled lunches together -- just Bill and me one-on-one -- fell by the wayside as gays in the military, Travelgate, Nannygate, the first budget battle, David Gergen, Lloyd Cutler, Whitewater, health care, Haiti, the second budget battle, the 1994 election, Whitewater again, Bosnia, the third budget battle, Whitewater again, China and Taiwan, welfare reform, and Whitewater again kept our respective schedules too tight for our weekly bonding.
<P>
Not so these days!
<P>
Last weekend, Bill, HRC, Tipper, and I spent some time in Tennessee rebuilding a church, and let me tell you, it was quality time all around. You don't really know them until you rebuild a church with them, let me tell you. For instance, who would have guessed that HRC is so handy with a nail gun? And even though Bill smashed his own thumb up pretty bad in the first couple of minutes, he spent the rest of the afternoon helping the Gore girls reach up to the ceiling studs.
<P>
Plus, we've been spending a lot of time together strategizing the convention. It's in Chicago this year, which makes sense in an Electoral College sort of way, but is a little risky politically. There hasn't been a Democratic National Convention in Chicago since 1968, and I'm not so sure that we want all 400,000 television viewers to be thinking ``student protests'' and ``hippie draft dodgers'' as they watch Bill get renominated. I think I may have insulted HRC when I asked her to try to remember exactly where she was all those years ago -- I mean, I hate to be the damage-control guy, but if Ted Koppel ever got hold of an old wire photo of the young HRC, all decked out in love beads, flipping some Chicago cop the bird, well, he'd be broadcasting live from Chicago faster than you can say, ``How about this for news?''
<P>
She acted kind of chilly for a few days after I asked, but I think I was right to bring it up. Lucky for us, Bill did his antiwar protesting in Moscow, where photojournalism wasn't so prevalent.
<P>
Other than those few bumps, though, we're cruising to victory in November. Sure, Bob Dole got a ``bounce'' from his convention. That's because it was a totally scripted affair, designed to project a ``tolerant'' and ``big tent'' image of the Republican Party. Dole kept all the pro-life advocates out of sight. Except for him and Jack Kemp, no other pro-lifers spoke; how diverse can a party be when the platform is pro-life, the convention speakers are pro-choice, and the nominees are pro-life? Well, actually, that sounds pretty diverse to me, but you get my point. We're a lot more diverse than they are. I mean, our African-American guy is a socialist. Theirs isn't. And we've got lesbians and gay men and trial lawyers and teachers' unions. Let's face it, Rusty: our tent is the only tent big enough to hold the whole circus.
<P>
Gotta go! Dr. Morris is at the door. The next time I write, Rusty, it'll be from the Big Bus!

2-SEPTEMBER-1996
<P>
Charles Murray reports that illegitimacy increased at record rates in the 1990s. A third of all American births, and 70 per cent of all black American births, are out of wedlock. But hey, we're winning the debate.

<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>


The media all but ignored the quadrennial Polympic Games in Washington, D.C., so we'll give you results here as fast as we can make them up. The shocker, of course, was that President Clinton was disqualified in the Prevarathon for that unguarded remark about raising our taxes too much. The judges ruled that he was trying to tell a truth! -- an almost unthinkable lapse. Mr. Clinton had built a seemingly insurmountable lead with ``didn't inhale'' before his tragic stumble.

Republican platform deliberations began with clear victories for pro-life delegates. The Dole campaign wanted to list abortion as an issue of ``personal conscience'' on which Republicans disagree. Despite heavy pressure on delegates -- from convention manager Paul Manafort, among others -- conservatives stood firm: intra-party disagreement would be acknowledged only generically, and vaguely pro-choice language kept out of the platform. Dole apparently thought the presidential nominee's word would be decisive. The price of his hubris was that his bold new tax-cut initiative had to compete for attention with this defeat in the same old intra-mural battle. He would have known better if he had paid attention to recent platform fights -- or, for that matter, to Kate O'Beirne's recent column on ``pro-Dole, out-of-control'' delegates. The next day, repeated attempts by abortion-rights proponents to ``yank the plank'' were defeated by large margins. This was predictable: pro-choice Republicans never organize to win these votes; they take their case to the media instead. They were at pains to declare they were good Republicans who would work hard to elect Dole; California Gov. Pete Wilson even held a press conference to say he would try to force a floor vote if he had to, all in order to help Dole. Only Ann Stone, head of  Republicans for Choice (a wholly owned subsidiary of CNN), was out of step rhetorically: she has taken to promising that November will be ``payback time.'' As we went to press the Dole team was deciding whether to try to placate Wilson and avoid a floor fight by allowing a pro-choice minority report. If Wilson is sincere about having Dole's best interests at heart -- which the nominee's staff doubts -- he can prove it by repudiating Mrs. Stone.

Leading in the Polympic Sword Fall are Hillary Clinton's former law partners Webster Hubbell, Vincent Foster, and William Kennedy; the Clintons' former business partners Jim and Susan McDougal; and former Arkansas Gov. Jim Guy Tucker. However, many Clinton associates have yet to take the big plunge.

For months the media have been going on about a forthcoming revolt by the GOP moderates. Now, at the first test -- the GOP platform debate in San Diego -- there was a successful rebellion: but by conservatives, and on the very issue which the party establishment had sought to obscure and defuse. By a nice coincidence, in the three GOP Senate primaries held on Tuesday, in Michigan, Georgia, and Kansas, the more conservative candidate won in each case. Sam Brownback won handsomely against the moderate Sheila Frahm, who had been appointed to fill the seat Senator Dole vacated in June. (Mr. Brownback's victory was achieved, it must be said, without any help from <B><I>NR</I></B>.) Where Mr. Brownback was vulnerable, notably on immigration, Mrs. Frahm failed to raise the issue. Where he was clearly in tune with the voters, notably on spending cuts, she attacked him as going too far. In other words, Mrs. Frahm was petrified by respectability, more attuned to media liberals than to her conservative constituents, and she is accordingly now a respectable ex-senator. Two conclusions suggest themselves. The conservative wing of the GOP is where the party's energy, passion, and ideas now repose. And moderate Republicans are a <I>nomenklatura</I> without an ideology. Indeed, that is why they appeal to the media.

The Federal Election Commission's complaint against the Christian Coalition -- that its voter guides constitute partisan activity co-ordinated with candidates -- is spurious and likely to fail in court. The operative legal standard here requires literature to include ``express advocacy'' (i.e., words like ``oppose,'' ``vote for,'' or ``defeat'') for it to count as partisan. The Coalition's guides simply inform voters how officials voted on issues of concern to Christian conservatives. If Democrats fare worse than Republicans, it is because of their votes. All the FEC has revealed is its penchant, typical of regulatory bodies, to expand its powers.

Rep. Sue Kelly (R., N.Y.) is part of the Republican fringe that voted against the ban on partial-birth abortions. She is being vigorously challenged by Joe DioGuardi, a right-to-life conservative who used to hold the seat. So it's not surprising that Reps. Bob Dornan (R., Calif.) and Chris Smith (R., N.J.), two of the most committed pro-lifers in Congress, would back DioGuardi. For this crime, the House leadership has come down on them like a ton of bricks. They are being denied legislative-conference seats which their subcommittee chairmanships would normally guarantee them. They were warned that their amendments would not reach the floor (the leadership has backed off on this point). And Smith's travel budget -- he chairs the International Operations and Human Rights subcommittee -- has been cut off. This follows a pattern in the 104th Congress of conservative dissenters being disciplined more harshly than liberal ones. Perhaps Bob Dole could suggest a tolerance plank to the House GOP leadership.

The Dole campaign has found an issue -- marijuana. Pot use among kids is up since Bill Clinton was inaugurated, so vote for Dole. But cocaine use is down; should we therefore vote for Clinton? It is too much to expect the GOP to rethink drug policy in the midst of an election campaign, but certain points -- the medical uses of marijuana; the draconian sentences still being served by casual possessors -- should induce it to show reason on the topic. Sending out Jointman to joust with Buttman keeps the debate on the puerile level favored by the Democrats. If Dole wants to make headway, he will have to focus on policies (e.g., affirmative action) which the Clintonites support when they are stone cold sober.

Much uneasiness among gun-control supporters. Prof. John Lott of the University of Chicago has released a terribly inconvenient study which finds that when law-abiding people are allowed to carry guns, crime drops. His nationwide, 15-year study records an 8.5 per cent drop in homicide, a 5 per cent drop in rape, and a 7 per cent drop in aggravated assault in jurisdictions which permit concealed weapons. Lott observed a slight rise in non-violent crimes, presumably as criminals plied their craft less riskily. Today 36 states now permit concealed weapons, up from 9 states ten years ago, which suggests the common sense underlying Prof. Lott's research has made a bigger impression on state legislators than on gun-control advocates.

Reviewing in the <I>New York Times Book Review</I>, Michael Lind's latest philippic against conservatism, Brent Staples whoops with delight over the author's discovery of the ``hoax'' of mass illegitimacy which, ``along with the idea that welfare causes out-of-wedlock births, is driving virtually all welfare policy.'' If Mr. Lind is right, Mr. Staples's review should have been on the newspaper's front page: <B>MILLIONS OF FATHERS FOUND AT HOME./WOMEN HONEST AFTER ALL./WELFARE REFORM A MISTAKE</B>. Not even the <I>New York Times</I>, however, will run that story because Mr. Lind's conclusion was a . . . fallacy. He pointed out that the rate of black teenagers' having out-of-wedlock babies has remained stable at 80 per 1,000 from 1920 through 1990. On this argument, illegitimate births have risen as a percentage of all births because married couples have fewer children, not because single women have more. Even if that were so, it would still be cause for concern because, unlike the period 1920 - 60, most young blacks today grow up in communities in which illegitimate births (and their attendant ills) are the norm. But it is not so. As Richard Brookhiser points out in <B><I>NR's </I></B> review (page 89), Mr. Lind's own book shows that from 1960 to 1989 expected <I>lifetime</I> births almost doubled for the average unmarried black woman (and almost tripled for the average unmarried white woman). The culprit? Welfare. Until the Sixties, single women might have children outside marriage, but they would then find a father for them and establish a two-parent family. Welfare enables single-parent families to subsist indefinitely while excusing fathers from their duties. The resulting family crisis is, alas, no hoax. And Mr. Staples's ready acceptance of it as one merely shows that fallacies which comfort are harder to detect than those which jar.

In this issue (Letters, page 4), Linda Chavez and John J. Miller seek to drive a wedge between <B><I>NR</I></B> and our economics analyst, Ed Rubenstein, by suggesting that he shares their view that immigration reduces inflation. Alas, they commit an elementary confusion between inflation and inflationary pressures of which Mr. Rubenstein, a staunch monetarist, was not guilty. When wages outstrip productivity (an inflationary pressure), the Fed has a choice: it can either do nothing and watch unemployment rise, or reduce the value of the wage hike by increasing the money supply (inflation). Immigration certainly works to remove this painful dilemma from the Fed -- but at the cost of producing the secondary effects directly. By increasing the supply of labor, immigration either reduces wages, or displaces existing workers, or a little of both. Naturally, anything that cuts wages and hikes unemployment will also tend to reduce inflationary pressures. Perhaps Miss Chavez and Mr. Miller favor other policies that will produce these desirable results. As for their general complaint about NR on immigration, we will happily say something good about them when they produce a good argument.

As the Hague Tribunal tries to hale Serbian war criminals before the bar of justice, the world should remember 1) that there are also Muslim and Croat thugs who are being (or should be) pursued; and 2) that most Serbs in the former Yugoslavia have been bystanders of its chaos. The Bosnian agony is the work of former Communist politicians and ideologues, willing to use communal hatreds in order to gain or hold power.

 WASHINGTON, D.C.<br>
<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT><font size=+1>n</font> the summer of 1994 Ward Connerly, a new regent of the University of California, was visited by Jerry and Ellen Cook. The Cooks' son, a Phi Beta Kappa undergrad, had been accepted to the combined Harvard/ MIT health sciences program, and was one of two California students admitted to Johns Hopkins Medical School. But he was turned away from the medical school at UC San Diego, just around the block from his home, which he hoped to attend to be near his ailing grandparents. The Cooks couldn't believe it. They gathered data from UC medical schools -- Mr. Cook is a statistician -- showing that at the lower grade-point averages and test scores, only preferred minorities were admitted, and that preferred minorities were in the lowest 1 per cent (in terms of GPA and test scores) of accepted students. The numbers, they told Connerly, proved UC was engaged in unconstitutional discrimination.
<P>
Connerly, who had already publicly questioned affirmative action, agreed. For the November regents' meeting, he requested an account of the system's admissions policies from the UC president, who reported back that the affirmative-action policies were necessary because diversity equals excellence and also in order to right the imbalance in medical service to minority communities (minority doctors, presumably, would serve in minority areas). ``I said, If you just change some of the words in here this sounds racist to me,'' Connerly recalls. Meanwhile, he obtained a matrix that served as a guide at UC Berkeley for explicitly scoring applicants by race. The administration denied doing any such thing. ``Yet I had this damn matrix that said they did,'' says Connerly. ``And when I confronted them with it, they said, 'Oh, gee, we forgot that.' The bastards just lied.'' 
<P>
Ward Connerly was getting a crash course in 1990s affirmative action: its victims, its spurious justifications, its protective cocoon of bureaucratic obfuscation and secrecy. Soon he would help enter a new word into the vocabulary of race preferences -- rollback. The low-key Connerly, with his close friend Gov. Pete Wilson providing well-publicized support, succeeded in pushing through measures in July 1995 that eliminated race as a factor in admissions, hiring, and contracting in the UC system. A few months after this high-profile fight had been won, he took the helm of what was then a struggling California Civil Rights Initiative (to be Proposition 209 on the November ballot). Now, not only does the outcome of perhaps the nation's most important election this November depend largely on his managerial and political skills, but his career, motivations, and even personal life have become a crucial part of the battleground.
<P>
CCRI opponents have mounted a well-financed and vicious campaign against the initiative -- the Ford, Rockefeller, and Carnegie Foundations have kicked in $1.5 million. One of the chief targets is Connerly. The <I>Oakland Tribune</I> recently ran an editorial cartoon of a dry-cleaning shop, with Klan capes hanging on the racks, called ``Connerly & Co -- Ethnic-Cleansers.'' But, what seems to threaten CCRI opponents most is that Connerly is black. Their solution: denying he is. Says State Senator Diane Watson of Los Angeles, ``He probably feels this makes him more white than black, and that's what he really wanted to be,'' adding, ``He married a white woman.'' Or as black San Francisco contractor Fred Jordan put it: ``[H]e's a hypocrite of the worst kind. He doesn't particularly want to be called African American or black, but he's using it very astutely to advance his own personal gains. For someone to stand within the ranks and say, 'I'm not black,' but use it to destroy his own people -- that's the kind we brand as a traitor.''
<P>
Connerly's treason goes even deeper, because he has no debts to racial preferences or to the agitations of the post-1964 civil-rights establishment. So, opponents strain to deny this too. One NAACP official told the <I>L.A. Times</I> that Connerly and Clarence Thomas are hypocrites because they ``thump their chest about merit, when neither of them operates in a realm where merit matters. It's political connections.'' In a bitter op-ed in the <I>L.A. Times</I> Richard Russell, president of the California Alumni Association, attributes Connerly's business success entirely to Pete Wilson. ``If I were in Connerly's position, I too might believe that the race card is largely irrelevant and had nothing to do with my successful position.'' Rather than  gratuitous nastiness, this line of argument is essential to defenders of affirmative action -- i.e., no minority makes it in America without special help. 
<P>
But, in Ward Connerly, they have the wrong man; if the personal is political, his life is a perfect preamble to his current position in the public debate. Connerly's parents divorced in 1941 before he was two and his mother died before he was four. He ended up living with a grandmother in an all-black neighborhood in Sacramento. ``There were certain rules that had to be followed,'' he recalls. ``There weren't many, but one of them was study. Before you go anyplace, study.'' There were four kids in his neighborhood who wanted to go to college, only one of whom owned a car. Connerly had the scores to make it into a four-year school, his friend did not. So Connerly asked his boss for a loan. ``[I]f I loan you the money to buy a car,'' he remembers his boss saying, ``[you'll need] insurance and there are going to be a lot of expenses that go with it. I think you're better off just getting by without the car -- you'll find a way.'' His boss did give him a raise. After two years of car-pooling with his friend to American River Junior College, Connerly had saved enough to buy a used '48 Chevy so he could enroll at Cal-State Sacramento.
<P>
<font size=+3>A</font<font size=+1>fter</font> graduating -- the first in his family to do so -- Connerly went to work for Sacramento's re-development agency, then the state housing department. Through his work there he met Pete Wilson, chairman of the State Assembly's new housing committee, who hired him as the committee's chief consultant. The two became fast friends, and Wilson's brand of Republicanism brought Connerly into the party. An early conversation sticks in Connerly's mind. ``He said, 'What are your plans in life?' I said, 'Well, I'll probably go back to the department of housing in some capacity.' He said 'What after that?' I said, 'Well, I'll probably someday become a division chief or something like that.' He said, 'Gee, that's awfully limiting. Haven't you ever considered other possibilities?''' Connerly hadn't. Working in government was a safe haven for blacks. Indeed, when the GOP lost its majority, Connerly landed back at the state housing department.
<P>
It was several more years before Connerly, in February 1973, felt he had enough experience and contacts to make the plunge into the private sector, where his business has been a success (and, <I>pace</I> his critics, has little to do with Wilson's patronage and nothing to do with set-asides). Connerly is 57 years old, balding and unassuming, if blunt. He has been involved in politics, but only as a fund-raiser and informal advisor to Wilson, and so friends were surprised when he splashed onto the front pages with CCRI. His moderate positions on social issues like abortion and gay rights make him an unlikely champion of such a hot-button issue. But Connerly has taken to it with a vengeance. ``He has an innate pro-Americanism that in a way makes him more in league with right-wing conservatives,'' says one CCRI insider. ``I think this has been a radicalizing campaign for him as he's watched some of his moderate allies go wishy-washy.'' Tom Wood and Glynn Custred, the two academics who originated CCRI, first came across Connerly at an August 1994 Assembly hearing on CCRI. ``He stole the show,'' says Wood. ``Glynn and I started plotting immediately on the drive back to the Bay area about how we could get him on board.''
<P>
Connerly initially wasn't interested -- worried primarily about his personal security (he received telephone threats for pushing the UC resolutions). But by the end of 1995 CCRI was on the verge of extinction. It had a couple of professors behind it and a lot of publicity, but little in the way of cash or organization. In November, when it had about three months to get 700,000 signatures, it had only 200,000 and signature gathering had been suspended. Wood and Co. went once again to Connerly, and he agreed to come on board. He and Wilson immediately got on the phone to provide a fund-raising infusion. Connerly, meanwhile, became CCRI's chief spokesman. ``Without Ward and Pete Wilson,'' says Wood, ``CCRI wouldn't have made it on the ballot.''
<P>
Will it pass? The ``no'' forces have the presumptive advantage in any initiative fight. In this case,  opponents are drawing on the resources of myriad organizations on the Left to try to overcome  CCRI's roughly 2 to 1 lead in the polls. Early on, opponents concluded their effort would have to have a white female face. They have indeed shamelessly distorted CCRI's Clause C -- innocuous language meant to exempt institutions like single-sex bathrooms from CCRI's scope -- to argue that the measure legalizes sex discrimination. They also stand to get a boost from a judge's ruling -- under appeal -- that the  relatively innocuous phrase ``affirmative action'' instead of just ``preferential treatment'' must appear in the ballot language. Furthermore, corporations are frightened of CCRI; Connerly recently had to ask Wilson to talk two CEOs out of publicly opposing the initiative (Pacific Gas and Electric has actually come out in opposition). The reaction of the national party has been similar, as Bob Dole appears to have chucked the issue overboard. ``Maybe we should count our blessings,'' Connerly comments dryly.
<P>
But the reaction of national Republicans leaves Connerly in an odd position, reviled by opponents while spurned by those who should be some of his strongest (and most grateful) supporters. ``The Senator Watson stuff isn't as bad as the people that you don't even know who point you out,'' says Connerly. He is often recognized by blacks in airports and elsewhere (whites don't seem to know him yet) who stare at him in disgust. ``You wouldn't be human if you didn't react in some way to that,'' he says. 
<P>
The Republican Party, meanwhile, is not always the most congenial home. Connerly will give speeches at Republican events, get standing ovations, then have a blue-haired lady ask him if he happens to know ``the nicest black man I ever met'' in Philadelphia or somewhere else. ``I just want to grab her,'' Connerly laughs, ``and say, 'Didn't you listen to what I said a few minutes ago? Didn't you listen at all?'''
<P>
<font size=+3>T</font><font size=+1>he GOP</font>'s national leaders aren't listening. ``If there ever was an issue that defines Republicanism . . . this is it,'' he says. ``I just want my party to stand for something.'' In the meantime, the small band of CCRI organizers and a handful of California GOP officials will have to do the standing for it, in the face of a withering opposition. Connerly, who describes himself as ``57 going on 70,'' says he has learned a couple things: 1) ``How truly biased some newspapers are.'' 2) ``You don't have to have facts to attack an initiative.'' 3) ``The voters are terribly uninformed.'' But, Connerly says, a fourth lesson trumps the others. ``There's a certain magic about democracy,'' he says. ``I can go into a room with fifty people and perhaps only one in fifty understands what the issue is really about, but somehow their collective intelligence, not in terms of IQ, but in terms of the values and the instincts they bring, transcends [everything else].'' There's no one in a better position to know all they have to transcend than Ward Connerly.

<H2>The Terrorists' Leverage</H2></CENTER>

<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, JULY 30
<P>









Whoever did in TWA 800 must be very pleased, which makes one wonder why he has not taken the satisfaction of identifying himself. One can imagine a mafia-style meeting of terrorists in a dacha in Lebanon. One is there from the West Bank, one from Syria, from Iran, from Libya, from Ireland. Maybe a North Korean is there, and then one or two who have privatized the art, a Kaczynski type; maybe a militiaman. They cackle about TWA and one of them gives a little proprietary shrug of the shoulders, which brings from the other end of the table, ``Get off that, Buster-ali. You had nothing to do with TWA.'' Eyes travel to him. Does he mean . . . the credit should go to his organization? 
<P>
Perhaps they simply settle for a sense of common accomplishment. They have undoubtedly committed something that, in their books, would be accepted as a quite exquisite crime. Everyone dead, spectacular attention world-wide, day after day. Two weeks have gone by and those fancy American investigators haven't even established that it was an explosion! And all of America is tensing up! I mean, it's the best scene, maybe, since Dallas. And what are those cocky Americans going to do? 
<P>
Good question. Benjamin Stein wrote a few weeks ago that the primary burden of the underclass in America isn't a lack of food or education or shelter. It is a life of insecurity. Their children at school are bullied, their apartments are time and again burgled (in Albany, Georgia, the husband of the woman killed at the Olympic Games rushed off to the hospital. When he got home he found his house burgled), the drug traffickers corrupt their children, and at night they have to lock themselves in to minimize exposure to violence. The great leverage of violence. The skyjacker's leverage, I called it years ago when the practice began of brandishing a pistol in the face of the pilot and telling him to fly the plane to Havana. 
<P>
We made headway against the hijackers. But we have over that species the advantage of imposing on them the same fate that would have befallen the crew and passengers if the plane had crashed. It was in the interest of the hijackers to keep the plane functioning. And since it had to land somewhere, the odds were always against them. After a while even Castro tired of giving them sanctuary, the United States passed a law authorizing the death penalty for a murdering hijacker, and Americans began funneling their hand luggage through security machines and being frisked when they forgot to empty their pocket of the tin cigar wrapper. 
<P> 
A modus vivendi was achieved. The skyjacking went way down, and Americans added airport security to the general overhead of life in modern times. Now there is what appears a revival of the art, without the foreplay of the skyjacker demanding merely a flight to Cuba or Lebanon. This time around, as with Air India and Pan Am and now TWA, they will settle for simply killing everybody on board. 
<P>
Viewed as nothing more than an abrasion of modern life, the cost is incidental. Catastrophic to the victims and their families, but statistically negligible, not even on the same chart with cigarette smoking or driving while drunk. But the great victory of the terrorist is precisely the progressive burden of air travel. Every American who travels, say, twenty times every year by plane is even now paying the equivalent of five to ten hours of tribute to the terrorists, if you assume 15 minutes to one half hour per flight consumed by security. The prospect is for much much more than that, on international flights especially. They are talking about check-in two or three hours before flight time. Once again, the equivalent of paying a tribute of two hours to an unknown terrorist for exercising the freedom to travel. 
<P>
Can we generate a purposive anger? We can always sit at home and rage against the killers, but that's pretty Platonic stuff, doesn't hurt them a bit if we just steam every time we think of them. 
<P>
There is only one way to apply direct pressure. We know that Syria and Iran and Libya are training terrorists, but we are not in a mood simply to bomb population centers there. We need discriminating targets, and to develop them we need abundant counter-intelligence. The G-7 powers are meeting now to consider retaliatory action. The imagination here should be encouraged. The easiest and most urgent step is a gaudy reward for anyone who will lead us to the terrorist. We know there are two holed up in Libya right now, responsible for the Pan Am Lockerbie incident. Perdicaris-alive-or-Rasuli-dead is the language we should be using with Mr. Qaddafi.

Dear Rusty,
<P>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->


<BR>
<BR>
<P>

It's been a tumultuous couple of weeks, let me be the first to admit. I'm sitting here in my office, it's late, but I'm too keyed up to go home -- I'm busy channel surfing, waiting for the early editions of the Post and the New York Times.
<P>
I guess this is how big Broadway actors feel on opening night: excited, nervous, thrilled -- you see, Bill announced late this afternoon that he's going to sign the welfare-reform bill, and I can't wait to see how it'll play in the national media.
<P> 
So far, on Inside Politics, we've been getting raves. There's been universal acclaim for the Clinton - Gingrich welfare plan. It'll be tricky, come election time, to help the voters distinguish between ``Clinton - Gingrich'' and ``Dole - Gingrich,'' but hey, that's what we pay those media guys the big bucks for, right? 
<P>
And on the NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, the word has been universally positive, except for one old fuddy-duddy who complained about ``no coherent philosophy,'' but let's be honest, Rusty -- there's no point in having a coherent philosophy if you're not in office. Just ask Jimmy Carter.
<P> 
I've been advocating this move for months -- you know me, Rusty, I was the original New Democrat, back in 1988 -- and for a long time, it was just me and Dick Morris, voices crying in the wilderness. We'd have long meetings in the Oval Office with the full staff -- me, Dick, George Stephanopoulos, Mike McCurry, Donna Shalala, Leon Panetta, and the rest of the gang -- and let me tell you, Rusty, it wasn't easy to win the argument. 
<P>
In the first place, Bill tends to agree with the last person who speaks, and since he calls on people to speak moving clockwise around the room, Dick and I had to keep getting up, pretending to stretch our legs, and sitting down a couple of seats over. That way, the debate would go: me, George, Dick, Leon, me, Donna, Dick, Mike, me, Bob Reich, Dick . . . and then we'd try to time it just right so that the conversation always ended with either me or Dick. 
<P>
It didn't look too natural. George caught on early, I think, because when Dick or I would get up to stretch our legs or ``get another Diet Coke,'' George would always get up too, ``to smooth out my pants,'' he'd say, but I noticed that he kept sliding down the couch, always trying to be the last one. 
<P>
At this afternoon's meeting -- the last one before Bill was supposed to announce his decision -- Dick very cleverly head-faked George by half-standing, then sitting down very quickly right next to Bill before George had a chance to slide completely over. There they were, slammed next to each other, shoulders touching, legs fighting for seat-cushion turf, pushing hard against each other until finally Dick, who has a lot more bulk, managed to squeeze George off the couch and onto the floor.
<P> 
And that's pretty much how welfare reform got signed into law. It was thrilling, let me tell you. 
<P>
Bill and I headed down to the briefing room while Dick got George into a half-nelson and stuffed a cushion into his mouth. I felt sorry for the guy, but I also knew that if he got so much as ``a million kids on the street'' out, Bill would get that quizzical look on his face, postpone the decision, and we'd still be nervous about Bob Dole.
<P> 
The only problem right now is HRC. She was down in Georgia when Bill called her.
<P>
``Hillary,'' he said into the phone, twisting the cord into a thousand loops, ``I've decided to back the House welfare reform.'' 
<P>
He winced a bit, and held the phone away from his ear for a few moments. 
<P>
He listened for a few seconds, then looked up. ``She wants to know if we can fix it later, after I'm re-elected,'' he said to Dick Morris. 
<P>
Dick shook his head and mouthed, ``No way.''
<P>
Bill nodded. ``Dick says, 'Of course we can,' Hillary. He's calling this a 'tactical center-shift.''' 
<P>
He winced again, held the phone away again.
<P>
``Okay, then, have it your way,'' he said. ``It's a 'tactical shift to the far right.' But I think we're just playing semantics.'' 
<P>
More wincing. 
<P>
``Hillary,'' he said into the phone, ``we're still very much in favor of partial-birth abortions. That should count for something.'' 
<P>
A few moments later, he hung up. ``She'll come around,'' he said. ``She's always said that in the second term, the gloves come off.''
<P> 
Rusty, the interns just brought in the Post and the Times. We're a hit! ``A masterful stroke,'' croons the Post. ``Brilliant leadership,'' cries the Times. ``Two thumbs up!'' say Shields and Gigot.
<P> 
Who knew being conservative was so . . . so popular? 
<P>
See you in Chicago!

<LI>Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic has agreed to stay in his house and take no part in the upcoming Bosnian elections. Considering how Dole is doing, can we make the same deal with him?

The House Republican leadership has ended a year of wavering about the Dole - Canady anti-preference bill with a pre-emptive surrender. Instead of attempting to abolish race and gender preferences in federal programs, employment, and contracting, the GOP will target its attack on the Small Business Administration's Section 8(a) program. The program is, to be sure, a noxious mix of racial preference, corporate welfare, and administrative inefficiency. The General Accounting Office reports that 1 per cent of certified firms receive a quarter of the business under the program; less than 9 per cent of contracts are awarded competitively; and less than 4 per cent of 8(a) firms become ``competitive.'' Some Hill Republicans think this program is analogous to partial-birth abortions, as being among the least defensible products of modern liberalism. But the power of the partial-birth-abortion issue was that it brought the abortion debate down from abstraction. When it comes to preferences, the public is already in tune with Republicans on broad principle. The debate should take place there, not at the level of eye-glazing bureaucratic detail. The retreat also opens Republicans to the charge of tolerating reverse discrimination against all Americans except the owners of corporations. Finally, while many liberals voted for the partial-birth-abortion ban, they are sure to fight any affirmative-action rollback -- especially since they can sense the GOP's fear.  ``On this issue the Republican leadership has been spinning around like a weather vane in a hurricane,'' says Rep. Charles Canady (R., Fla.), who, along with Susan Molinari (R., N.Y.) and Chris Cox (R., Calif.), has stood on principle. It is ground they share with the American people -- if not, alas, with Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey.

When Democratic congressional leaders unveiled their ``Families First'' agenda last month, it was hailed by some as evidence of the party's newfound moderation on size-of-government and social issues, and derided by others as a pale imitation of the Contract with America. But it turns out that even when they try to present their best face to the public, New Democrats still have to placate the same Old Left constituencies. Among their agenda's 21 planks was a little-noticed call for ``fair pay'' and ``pay equity'' -- the current code-phrases for ``comparable worth,'' that golden oldie of late-Seventies feminism. The idea, remember, was that equal pay for men and women doing the same jobs wasn't enough, because men and women congregate in different fields. So occupations dominated by women should pay the same wages as ``comparable'' work in other fields; e.g., secretaries should be paid like lab technicians. Determining the proper compensation for each job would, naturally, require heroic efforts by lawyers, bureaucrats, and assorted experts. ``Families First'' is slippery about all this, as befits a party being remade in Bill Clinton's image. The Democrats want the Secretary of Labor to develop ``voluntary fair pay guidelines for the nation's employers'' and to hold a National Summit on Fair Pay to devise ``a specific legislative action plan for Congress to better achieve fair pay in American workplaces.'' The upshot is unmistakable: for 1990s Democrats, moderation means central planning with a feminist face.

Republicans scored a few victories in last year's appropriations process -- e.g., when they zeroed out programs like the Women's Educational Equity Act. The twenty-year-old program exists to make congressmen feel righteous about their opposition to girls' scoring poorly in math, while allowing feminists to funnel dollars to their brethren and sistren in the field: $91,000 to Wellesley's Center for Research on Women, $139,000 to Educational Equity Concepts, Inc., for a program on ``Gender-Based Teasing and Bullying in Grades K - 5,'' and so on. Since Republicans are in the ``two steps back'' stage of their revolution, it should come as no surprise that 101 House Republicans voted to restore $2 million for the act, their consciences pricked by Nita Lowey (D., N.Y.) and Connie Morella (R., Md.). Cheers at Wellesley. But for taxpayers not in residence at a women's studies program, the vote is another sign that they need this limping GOP Congress like a fish needs a bicycle.

At a Washington dinner hosted by <B><I>NR</I></B>, Richard Lamm came across as a genial and intellectually curious presidential candidate lost in a minor party. Not everyone will warm to his can't-do collectivism, but on some issues -- notably entitlements and immigration -- his views coincide with those of most conservatives. While he's unlikely to win the Reform Party's nomination, let alone the Presidency, his candidacy is among the many portents of a potentially dramatic realignment of American politics if the GOP continues to falter. Mr. Lamm is a serious man whose arguments deserve a hearing (more than can be said of his rival, Ross Perot).

Under normal circumstances, Rep. Sam Brownback's August 6 primary challenge to Sheila Frahm, Bob Dole's appointed successor in the Senate, would have <B><I>NR</I></B>'s support. Brownback is making nice noises about cutting taxes, social issues, etc. And if he's really a recovered moderate (he did not sign the Contract with America), we are prepared to rejoice over any sheep which was lost. But circumstances are not normal. Brownback led the sabotaging of the Smith - Simpson immigration-reform bill this year. Roy Beck, <B><I>NR</I></B> contributor and author of the fine <I>Case against Immigration</I> (Norton), points out in an open letter to Kansas papers that the state's meatpacking workers are a classic case-study of irresponsible displacement by employers who, in the welfare state, can dump the social costs of immigration onto local communities. We cannot endorse Sheila Frahm, who is pro-choice. But we can declare neutrality.

In the July 15 <I>New Yorker</I>, James Stewart reports that Whitewater prosecutor Ken Starr is ``highly unlikely'' to seek high-profile indictments before the November elections. Mr. Starr says that the effect of charges on the political process is ``a powerful counsel for restraint.'' We hereby file a motion to reconsider. A prosecutor's duty is to bring indictments when he thinks the evidence justifies them, neither sooner nor later. Withholding indictments until after the election would politicize the prosecution as much as deliberately seeking to indict before the election. And it could be far worse for the country. The least desirable outcome would be for damaging revelations to surface at the opening of a second term, when congressional Democrats might be ready to dispense with Mr. Clinton. One Watergate was enough.

The Office of Management and Budget now predicts a $117-billion deficit for this fiscal year. That's $29 billion less than the Administration forecast only a few months ago. A great vindication of Clinton's fiscal policy? Or did Congress have something to do with it? The 104th Congress was the first in nearly thirty years to make real cuts -- not phony ``baseline'' cuts -- in discretionary spending. Admittedly, this was not a surgical operation; the government shutdown and continuing resolutions played major roles. But we'll take it: federal spending will fall to 21.3 per cent of gross domestic product this year, en route to an 18.8 per cent share (and balance) by 2002. Meanwhile, federal revenues are still on the up escalator. At 19.7 per cent of GDP, this year's tax burden is the heftiest since the recession of 1982. (Wall Street, please note.) If we dodge a deep recession, a zero deficit in 2002 is in the cards. Then the real problems start. When the baby-boomers retire, Medicare and Social Security will drive federal spending to unprecedented levels. Outlays could reach 37 per cent of GDP by 2030, according to the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlements. The deficit? An astounding 18.5 per cent of GDP in 2030. Hold the champagne.

On July 17, 4 Senators and 37 Representatives filed suit to compel the Clinton Administration to comply with the 1996 Defense Authorization Act. Title II of that Act, which covered ballistic-missile defense, required the Pentagon to develop and deploy the Army's Theater High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) and the Navy's Theater-Wide Defense (TWD) according to a definite timetable. Whereupon Secretary of Defense William Perry declared that he had no intention of doing so. When President Nixon refused to spend funds as appropriated, his attempted ``impoundment'' provoked storms of outrage. ``Dangerous . . . no justification . . . unconstitutional,'' thundered then-Rep. Abner Mikva -- lately a Clinton White House Counsel. Yet the Clinton Administration gives no excuses or explanations; it simply refuses to comply with the law. Hats off to Rep. Floyd Spence, chairman of the House National Security Committee and leading plaintiff in <I>Spence</I> v. <I>Clinton</I>, and to Sens. Jon Kyl and Strom Thurmond, Reps. Bob Livingston and Curt Weldon, and others who defended ballistic-missile defense and the law.

Bob Dole celebrated his 73rd birthday, and many happy returns -- as seems likely from the superb medical report his office issued.

Northern Ireland is again in crisis after Protestant Orangemen sought permission to march alongside a nationalist Catholic housing development on Garvaghy Road in the small town of Portadown. Local Catholics, led by an ex-IRA man who had bombed a Protestant hall, objected, predicting violence. So the Northern Ireland chief constable -- a Dubliner -- forbade the march, and thousands of policemen dutifully held the Orangemen back while militant Protestants elsewhere almost closed Northern Ireland down, causing scores of Catholics to flee their homes. Tens of thousands of Orangemen converged on Garvaghy Road, causing the chief constable to capitulate. He allowed a small and silent party of Orangemen to march, while policemen cleared the way, now using batons against protesting Catholics. Nationalist areas promptly erupted in a vengeful fury. Dublin blamed London for going easy on Protestants and hard on Catholics, but there is no simple way to subdue a majority community in insurrection without intolerable bloodshed. All policy in Northern Ireland risks making one side uneasy, and the Protestants, nervous since the Anglo-Irish agreement of 1985, and increasingly frightened of being sold down the river, cracked first. Their violence, appalling though it was, showed once again how a concession to one side will trigger violence from the other. If Protestants will go this far to let a few Orangemen walk down Garvaghy Road, to what lengths will they go to stay out of a united Ireland?

Is there a better television journalist than ABC's John Stossel? His latest <I>20/20</I> eye-opener exposed the Americans with Disabilities Act, the hyper-complex law that grants ``disability'' protection to a variety of dysfunctions, and hobbles businesses (e.g., the Los Angeles strip club that has been ordered to build a wheelchair ramp because ``someone in a wheelchair might want to become a show stripper''). The program's highlight was Stossel's interview with Gilbert Casellas, the chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Casellas: ``The law's fairly clear, it's fairly simple.'' Stossel: ``If you come to me applying for a job, and your arm's in a sling, can I ask you why your arm is in a sling?'' Casellas: ``You can ask -- you know what? I'm going to ask you to stop the tape . . . we're getting into a complicated area . . .'' Stossel: ``You run the EEOC, and you don't even understand [the rules]? How's some employer in Iowa supposed to know them?'' When the grilling stopped, Casellas was left thoroughly disabled.

 WASHINGTON, D.C.<br>
<FONT SIZE=+3>A</FONT><font size=+1>t first</font> only members of the House Ways and Means Committee wanted to send President Clinton a stand-alone welfare-reform bill. For months, the Republican strategy had been to combine welfare reforms with changes to the Medicaid system that President Clinton couldn't stomach, guaranteeing a Clinton veto of the welfare - Medicaid package (in what could be his third veto of welfare legislation). But Ways and Means members, after more than a year of labor, were anxious to see their handiwork become law. Committee members John Ensign (R., Nev.) and David Camp (R., Minn.) circulated a letter to the leadership in June asking that the House pass a welfare bill stripped of the Medicaid veto-bait. It got about fifty signatures. Speaker Newt Gingrich opposed the idea, hoping to give the Dole campaign an opportunity to attack Clinton over a third welfare veto. But, soon, it would be a lost cause.
<P>
Rep. Jimmy Hayes (R., La.), one of last year's party-switchers, convinced Majority Leader Dick Armey at a June meeting in the Ways and Means room of the Capitol that Clinton would have to veto even a stand-alone bill or risk infuriating his base. Meanwhile, it seemed increasingly senseless for the House to try to protect the interests of a floundering Dole campaign. If Congress passed a bill the President could sign, Members would get credit back home for a major accomplishment. ``The campaign wasn't scoring points on welfare anyway,'' explains one party official. When Ensign and Camp wrote another letter, they got more than a hundred signatures just by walking onto the House floor. House leaders weren't sure they could pass even the procedural ``rule'' -- typically a party-line vote -- for a bill keeping welfare and Medicaid together. The two would have to be split  -- and the Dole campaign would have to fend for itself.
<P> 
The decision to send Clinton a welfare bill he might sign is emblematic, not only of a potential major rift between congressional Republicans and the Dole campaign, but of the way the weakness of the campaign feeds further weakness; it prompts the GOP to throw good politics after bad. No Republican  wins from the welfare decision. If the President signs a bill, Dole loses irrevocably one of the GOP's traditional top three issues (taxes, crime, welfare). Getting anything other than a watered-down bill through Senate moderates, meanwhile, is always a dicey proposition (some Ways and Means members, privately banking on a second Clinton term, argue that <I>any</I> bill passed this year is the best chance at reform this century). Finally, House Republicans may well find that disarming Dole on a major issue would ultimately hurt more than their ``accomplishment'' helps. ``Any guy who is in a marginal district who thinks he needs welfare to boost him,'' argues a top Senate staffer, ``doesn't realize that . . . if Bob Dole is not doing well, it doesn't matter -- he sinks without a trace.''
<P>
But Capitol Hill Republicans, understandably, aren't in the mood for being team players. The feeling, according to one long-time congressional aide, is reminiscent of 1992, ``when we were getting bashed on the fairness issue, [and] Republicans kept waiting for the Bush campaign to rescue them. Finally we realized the cavalry wasn't going to come over the hill.'' This year no one is expecting a charge of the Dole brigade. ``People have given up,'' says a senior House leadership staffer. ``They're looking at Dole and he's awful. He's a nothing. He's a zero.'' It is only July, with the public more focused on Dan O'Brien's long jumps than Bob Dole's flip-flops. But if the Dole campaign continues to drift, congressional Republicans will resort to more free-lancing like the welfare - Medicaid split. Another House aide gives Dole a few more weeks to find his voice, but ``if he doesn't, it's going to be CYA, baby.''
<P>
<font size=+3>I</font><font size=+1>F</font> House Republicans abandon Dole, it will be a sort of rough justice -- since Dole left them first. In a June interview with the <I>Washington Times</I>, Dole gave House freshmen the back of his hand: ``Those people who voted for you [freshmen] want you to do, but they don't want you to do it so fast'' (sic). His bumbling reversal on the assault-weapons ban cut the legs out from under House members who had made a tough vote to repeal the ban in order to keep the gun-rights portion of the GOP base happy. Dole, of course, was working at cross-purposes, trying to distance himself from that same base (and succeeding -- only 62 per cent of Republicans support him, according to recent polls). The strategy is the mirror image of Clinton's ``triangulation,'' which works for the President because what his core supporters represent is unpopular with the rest of the country. Dole, on the other hand, dampens his own party's enthusiasm by eschewing the very issues with which Republicans win swing voters (abortion, affirmative action, etc.).
<P>
Compounding the strategic divergence is the Dole campaign's organizational disarray. Speaker Gingrich convenes weekly Thursday-morning meetings with top staff  from the campaign committees, Sens. Spence Abraham (Mich.) and Paul Coverdell (Ga.) and Reps. Bob Franks (N.J.) and Jennifer Dunn (Wash.) -- all former state party chairmen -- to talk about the shape of the national GOP campaign. At first a representative of the Dole campaign would attend the meeting. Lately, the campaign has been AWOL. For Hill offices, trying to reinforce the Dole message -- assuming there is one -- is often a shot in the dark; it's easier to find out what the White House will be doing in days ahead than the Dole campaign. A schedule of coming events produced by the RNC for the Gingrich meetings has a column for the Dole campaign -- sometimes left nearly blank.
<P>
There have been daily morning conference calls between communications offices on the Hill and Dole communications staff. But, explains one GOP press officer, it has become increasingly clear that staff-level co-ordination is a waste of time as long as the Dole campaign is ``a rudderless ship.'' So the House has revamped its own communications apparatus around daily meetings involving Gingrich, other members of the leadership, National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Bill Paxon, and Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich. In a kind of communications whip effort, the members will decide who among congressional Republicans can help deliver a daily message. Officially, the new structure has nothing to do with Dole, but privately some House aides describe it as a way of going alone -- until the campaign catches up.
<P>
Congressional Republicans share some of the blame for the GOP's funk. For one thing, over the last two years they have reinforced Dole's natural aversion to tax cuts. Jack Kemp, Sen. Trent Lott, Sen. Connie Mack, Dick Armey, and Newt Gingrich -- the so-called ``amigos'' -- have recently focused with more energy on how to get the party back on the growth track. One idea (which has already been carried out) was a Hill conference on the slow pace of the Clinton recovery.  A useful by-product of the activity is preparing the ground for a Dole tax cut (both Donald Rumsfeld and Vin Weber, two tax-cutters in the Dole camp, have been involved).
<P>
The House GOP has also abetted Dole's punt on race preferences. The campaign's unwillingness to talk about the California Civil Rights Initiative approaches insanity; in recent polling by California assembly candidates, Dole was losing by about 10 points in two swing districts in Long Beach, while CCRI was winning by 30. But the House has followed Dole's affirmative-action retreat with alacrity.
<P>
The irony is that if Congress goes its own way it may become even more timid. Republicans do best when campaigns are nationalized around a few polarizing issues. But with the Dole campaign showing little interest in that kind of campaign, congressional Republicans will be forced back on traditional incumbent campaigns, emphasizing their bi-partisan accomplishments (a marked contrast to 1994, when confrontational Republicans defined Clinton as a liberal). Welfare is one example. The other is health care, with Republicans likely to jettison their attempt to get Medical Savings Accounts in a rush to pass a version of the Kassebaum -  Kennedy regulation bill that the President can sign. If this strategy worked in the past for congressional Democrats -- natural deliverers of pork, from local water projects to the various benefits of the welfare state -- it's not so clear it will be a boon to Republicans, especially if a Dole campaign constitutes a huge drag from the top.
<P>
GOP congressmen are counting on a variety of buffers from a Dole campaign downdraft. One is money. The Republican campaign committees have huge money leads over their Democratic counterparts and so will many individual Republican incumbents (although union spending vitiates this advantage somewhat). Another is candidates. When the parties were recruiting congressional candidates the political environment still favored Republicans, and it shows. Third and last is geography. A Dole debacle could kill Republicans in tough Northeastern districts, but the big GOP gains last year were concentrated in the South, where Republicans stand to make more headway no matter what. Some on the Hill even talk of ``reverse coattails,'' drumming up enough turn-out in their own districts to carry Dole. Would that it were possible. Says political analyst Stu Rothenberg: ``That's not just wishful thinking, that comes from the Land of Oz.''
<P>
The bad news is that straight-ticket voting is on the rise. ``People aren't going to turn out and vote for Bill Clinton and [vulnerable Kentucky freshman] Ed Whitfield,'' says one party official. ``That's just not going to happen.'' Columnist Robert Novak projects that, if the election were held today, there would be a 50 - 50 split in the Senate. If Dole loses by more than eight points, the GOP majority in the House could begin to fade too.
<P>
There is still time for the political environment to change. An over-confident Clinton could veto welfare reform. The Dole tax package could be bold enough to energize his party. But, whatever happens, there's no avoiding Bob Dole. A stampede to desert him, further demonstrating his weakness and contributing to a still larger loss, will ultimately hurt the deserters. For Republicans, the Dole campaign is like a bad dream, filled with hints of impending doom, but no opportunity for escape.

<H2>Zounds! Enforcing The Law in Idaho!</H2></CENTER>

<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, JULY 9
<P>




The <I>Wall Street Journal</I> reports on Gem County in Idaho, which is conducting a daredevil experiment with the law, by enforcing it. Sitting in the statute books all these years is a little derelict that says that ``any unmarried person who shall have sex with an unmarried person of the opposite sex shall be found guilty of fornication.'' The county prosecutor whose bright idea was to apply the law didn't do so indiscriminately. To have done this would of course have meant to repeal the Playboy Philosophy, and nobody thinks himself grand enough or powerful enough to accomplish that. But Mr. Douglas Varie decided to focus on just one aspect. Teenage pregnancy.
<P>
As everybody (almost everybody) knows, there is such a thing as prosecutorial discretion, which means that you can't defy the cop who stops you for speeding on the grounds that he didn't stop the other guy for speeding. There are exceptions. If prosecutorial conduct bumps into the civil-rights laws, then intervention by the courts can be tried. If only Hispanics or women are stopped for speeding, they can complain and get a hospitable hearing.
<P>
But Mr. Varie didn't start snooping around in motels or parking lots overlooking the scenic splendors of the State of Idaho. He started looking for pregnant teenagers. In fact, he narrowed the search still further. He has been looking for pregnant teenagers who apply for welfare.
<P>
Having done this, he then looks for the feller who got the girl in the family way. And although this is often another teenager, sometimes it is not, for instance in a recent case in which the stud, Michael Hopkins, was 22 years old. The penalty for lewd and lascivious behavior can be life imprisonment. Nobody expects this to happen, but the mere thought of it might interfere with Michael's cocksureness in future encounters. (One pregnant girl was sentenced to thirty days for a misdemeanor and she was quite shocked by the severity of the sentence.) The prosecutor pointed out that the community had every right to be shocked at the prospect of a child being born out of wedlock, which increases by a very high percentage the probability that that child will end up in prison, on welfare, illiterate, and on drugs.
<P>
Needless to say, the American Civil Liberties Union has got into the act, though it isn't absolutely clear what case it has. The prosecutor asked the general question: Does the community intend to enforce the law against statutory rape? This is defined as sexual encounters with girls under a certain age. What does one do, he asked, in a situation in which a 15-year-old girl is made pregnant by a 22-year-old man, and declines to charge her companion with rape? The common-law provision in such cases is to pronounce any sexual intercourse with under-age girls as that exactly  -- rape. And whatever ambiguities beset the law when deciding whether sexual congress took place, there aren't any when the girl is pregnant.
<P>
The Idaho experiment reminds us once again of a paradox in the development of social practices in free societies. It is that these societies suffer from heavy criticism of their toughness (the Darwinian reproach) but shrink from getting the benefits from toughness. We terribly much want American children to learn to read and write, and we offer them public facilities in which to learn how to do this. But if they refuse to learn, we do -- nothing. We very much desire that youngsters not band together in gangs that harass innocent people, but on the whole, we do nothing about them. We terribly want boys and girls not to create children doomed to neglect, 
but far from discouraging such activity, we subsidize it.
<P>
A free society is one that in most cases imposes penalties by its own devices. If you start a mousetrap factory and produce a product less successful than that of your competitors, what happens is that you go broke. The people who work for you lose their jobs, you lose your capital, and the empty factory building is auctioned off. But if you create one of the one million children born out of wedlock every year, you pass along the welfare cost to the government and, as often as not, produce another child. Mr. Varie thinks that is not a good idea and has come up with the ingenious solution of activating, in however diluted form -- the law. Very much worth watching, Gem County.

<BR>
July 15, 1996<p><P>

NSA SATELLITE DOWNLINK INTERCEPT<br>

MALE VOICE [identified as: Vice President of the United States]: Hi, Rusty! I'm flying home from Moscow. Can you hear me? [Inaudible.]<br>

VPOTUS: Hello?<br>

FEMALE VOICE [Identified as: Mrs. Gore/Second Lady of the United States]: Al?<br>

VPOTUS: Hi, Tip.<br>

SLOTUS: How did the meeting with Yeltsin go?<br>

VPOTUS: Not so well. He kind of didn't make it. I think he was sick or something.<br>

SLOTUS: Sick? What kind of world leader is so sick that he can't meet the Vice President of the United States?<br>

VPOTUS: I don't know. A sick one, I guess.<br>

SLOTUS: This is a problem. It's a serious loss of face.<br>

VPOTUS: C'mon. It's not like I'm president.<br>

SLOTUS: You never miss an opportunity to remind me of that, do you?<br>

VPOTUS: Tipper!<br>

SLOTUS: Al, go back.<br>


VPOTUS: Back to Moscow?<br>

SLOTUS: No. Back to Ft. Lauderdale. YES BACK TO MOSCOW!<br>

VPOTUS: Keep your voice down. People will hear.<br>

SLOTUS: Al, look at things realistically. Ken Starr is not going to go to the Grand Jury before October, and they won't return indictments until mid-November at the earliest. David Brock's book is going to come out after Labor Day. And Dole's chief strategist seems to be Dr. Kevorkian.<br> 

VPOTUS: What's your point, Tip?<br>

SLOTUS: My point is, when you get stood up by a world leader, well, it makes you and the office of the Vice President seem inconsequential. The whole thing reeks of . . . Mondale. Or worse: Bush.<br>

VPOTUS: Tipper, if I may, I'm pretty much regarded as a kind of ``co-president.''<br>

SLOTUS: Wake up and smell the coffee, Al. He doesn't need you to look presidential any more. Somehow, some way, he did it himself.<br>

VPOTUS: Well, that's great news! I'm thrilled! What terrific news! Really! Just terrific!<br>

SLOTUS: He's 27 points ahead of Dole in California.<br>

VPOTUS: [Expletive deleted!]<br>

SLOTUS: Now they want you and me to take a ``power walk'' together on Good Morning America to demonstrate the Surgeon General's new guidelines for exercise.<br>

VPOTUS: Actually, that sounds like fun.<br>

SLOTUS: Al, they don't mean it to be fun. They want to diminish your role. It helps you-know-who look more presidential.<br>

VPOTUS: How do you know this?<br>

SLOTUS: I went to last week's strategy meeting in the Yellow Room.<br>

VPOTUS: You went to a Yellow Room meeting? Wow! Tipper, how did you get in? They don't even let Hillary in those.<br>

SLOTUS: Never mind.<br>

VPOTUS: Tipper -- I demand to know how you talked your way into a closed and very private campaign strategy meeting.<br>

SLOTUS: I didn't talk my way in. And I didn't sneak in. I walked in, Al. I walked straight in.<br>

VPOTUS: What?<br>

SLOTUS: Okay, okay. I was dressed as a maid.<br>

VPOTUS: Honestly, Tipper! Dressing up as a maid! You make me feel like Ricky Ricardo!<br>

SLOTUS: You know, Richard Berke of the New York Times was a lot more grateful for the information than you are.<br>

VPOTUS: Okay, Tipper. What did you hear?<br>

SLOTUS: First, no bus trip after the convention.<br>

VPOTUS: Oh, man! I loved that bus trip!<br>

SLOTUS: Also, you're only allowed a short speech. And you've got to make a lot of attack speeches.<br>

VPOTUS: Who am I? Spiro Agnew?<br>

SLOTUS: That's what I said at the meeting. And then everyone turned and looked at me. And Dick Morris asked my name. I scooted out pretty fast.<br>

VPOTUS: Do you think they recognized you?<br>

SLOTUS: C'mon. It's the White House. You know how lax security is over there. And I snuck back in after the meeting to see if they had left any strategy memos around.<br>

VPOTUS: Had they?<br>

SLOTUS: Hard to tell. Those Clinton people are so messy. Too bad I was dressed as a maid. I had to spend an hour cleaning up after them. Just as I was about to leave, Bill stuck his head into the room. He said ``Tipper?'' I just about died!<br>

VPOTUS: Oh no! What did you do?<br>

SLOTUS: I froze. Then I heard her voice from the hallway. ``Tip her?'' she said. ``Why should we tip any of them?'' And he nodded and shuffled off. Thank God those people are so rough on the help.<br>

VPOTUS: I'm coming home, Tipper. You're getting into too much trouble.<br>

SLOTUS: Then I better get out our power-walking shoes. [Static.] [END INTERCEPT]

It crept across the country with July Fourth's summer dawn -- the stunning realization that the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> editorial page had yet again flinched from repeating its once-traditional annual call for a constitutional amendment proclaiming ``There Shall Be Open Borders.'' Indeed, there was no triumphalist immigration editorial at all. Mothers hushed crying children. Fathers gathered in grim groups under the bunting-bedecked pictures of Julian Simon crossing the Delaware and Emma Lazarus producing the Declaration of Independence from an Ellis Island steamer trunk. Everyone had accepted that the Journal edit page had to duck in 1994, in the (vain) hope of lulling Californians into not voting for Proposition 187's ban on welfare for illegal immigrants. And in 1995, of course, the edit page had to give priority to its (successful) disinformation campaign against the Smith - Simpson immigration-reform bills. But 1996? Were the <I>Journal</I> edit pagers demoralized by the devastating Rand Corporation report confirming that many recent immigrants are indeed failing in the economy? Humiliated at being singled out by Peter Passell, in his judicious column on the Rand report in the <I>New York Times</I>, because of their embarrassing hostility to evidence? Say it ain't so, Bob Bartley!

When Katie Couric asked Bob Dole if he thought C. Everett Koop had been ``brainwashed'' by the liberal media, he replied, ``Probably a little bit.'' Talk of brainwashing has no place in American politics, Mr. Dole. As Daniel Patrick Moynihan once remarked, a light rinse would have done the trick.

The Census Bureau is debating whether to create a new racial category for the 2000 census -- ``multiracial.'' A recent government phone survey suggested that 1.6 per cent of Americans identify themselves in that way. Racial intermixing is actually much more widespread; up to three-quarters of black Americans have at least one white or Indian ancestor. (Jesse Jackson, for instance, has some of each.) What effect would a new category have? To the extent that it broke down the rigid black - white color lines of slavery, Jim Crow, and affirmative action, it would be a good thing. But if it added another preferred class of citizens (like ``Hispanic'' class, created by the Bureau several censuses back), then it would be one more step to Bosnia, from sea to shining sea. Here's a question: How many federal policy-makers identify themselves as ``Americans''?

<I>Independence Day</I> is, as anyone who has been on this planet knows, a rip-roaring tale of alien invasion. More surprisingly, it is also a showcase for belief in ``Area 51,'' a top-secret base in Nevada where some think (yes they do) that the government carries out experiments on downed UFOs. <I>Independence Day</I> is science fiction, so perhaps this is to be expected. <I>The Rock</I>, however, is not science fiction; it is an action movie dominated by heavily armed men fighting for control of Alcatraz. Yet even this film reveals that a flying saucer really did crash near Roswell, New Mexico. What next? Alien ``greys'' near the grassy knoll? E.T., phone Stone.

At presstime passage of a minimum-wage increase looks like a done deal, while the prospects for health-insurance regulation are in doubt. And that is all that's on the agenda of this Republican Congress: destroying low-wage jobs and the individual insurance market. This situation is the natural consequence of GOP paralysis on economic policy. Rep. Bill Archer (R., Tex.), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, recently illustrated how even conservative Republicans have reverted to a pre-Reagan mode. Commenting on proposals for a 15 per cent across-the-board tax cut, he said, ``I don't know where you get those spending savings that can be approved'' in the House and Senate. In other words, we don't have the political will for spending cuts, and we won't be ``irresponsible'' and cut taxes without them. Republicans let their deficit obsession box them in, and superficially appealing but destructive proposals filled the vacuum. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and his colleagues must reassert control over the political agenda. Or else what's a majority for?

Meanwhile, anyone who enjoys a good culture clash really ought to have been present in London last week, when Pat Buchanan addressed a roomful of Tory Party luminaries, right-wing British journalists, and assorted plutocrats, together with a sprinkling of members of the leisured upper classes and Taki. The event was a black-tie dinner, given by Jimmy Goldsmith, the billionaire and fierce advocate of protectionism; the venue was Spencer House, the lush eighteenth-century London mansion once owned by the family of the Princess of Wales. After dinner, Buchanan gave more or less the same sort of speech he would give to a group of steelworkers in Michigan. In short, he impressed all those present with his energy, his command of statistics (the British do not bother with statistics) and ability to speak without notes (this is still a country which respects and admires extemporaneous speaking), and his condemnation of the European Union, an organization he (rightly) puts in the same category as the United Nations. Most of his listeners, however, found his economics perplexing, if not, in the words of one guest, ``insane.'' The British, and British Tories in particular, believe very deeply that they have historically been the beneficiaries of free-trade policies. No upstart American was going to change their minds in one evening. But a good time was had by all, and Buchanan certainly made the best joke. He would not make any comments about President Clinton, he said: it is customary for American politicians not to insult the President while abroad -- and certainly not while he's on active military duty.

The expose by retired FBI agent Gary Aldrich has prompted much self-flagellating introspection by media elites who regret the attention they've given a book whose most explosive charge is wholly unsubstantiated. The allegation that Bill Clinton sneaks over to the Marriott for illicit liaisons is apparently a rumor passed to Aldrich by conservative author David Brock, who is shocked, <I>shocked</I>, that it was reported as fact in <I>Unlimited Access</I>. Of course, the media haven't been so squeamish about second-hand sources in the past. Brent Bozell of the Media Research Center reminds us that the media widely reported George Bush's alleged affair and similarly unsubstantiated charges by Kitty Kelley, and Anita Hill easily met the media's reliability test. Aldrich's book suffers from the animus he clearly feels toward Clinton staffers whom he views as uncouth and disrespectful. He can be forgiven for disliking disagreeable people, but his outrage over the irresponsible behavior of the ``Arkansas mafia'' in the White House gets the better of his novice editorial judgment. Regrettably, his credible first-hand accounts of the Clintonites' disregard for national security has been lost in the media barrage against his unreliable sources. To discredit the book, the Administration has called it a right-wing conspiracy led by the Dole campaign. But the notion of Dole conspiring with right-wingers is far more fantastic than the notion of the President slipping out to a hotel.

The National Education Association congregated in Washington, D.C., to congratulate itself on a job ill done and to endorse -- surprise -- President Clinton for re-election. But it wasn't all a love fest. A proposal to endorse a ``Lesbian and Gay History Month'' for all of America's schools was struck down, its advocates placated with a resolution opposing all forms of ``discrimination and stereotyping.'' The NEA also resolved that ``efforts to legislate English as the official language disregard cultural pluralism, deprive those in need of education, social services, and employment, and must be challenged.'' At least they practice what they preach.

The Libertarian Party also convened in Washington over the July 4th holiday, nominating investment expert Harry Browne as its presidential candidate. Twenty-five years after the birth of the party, Browne believes that the ``American people are fed up with this wasteful, extravagant government''; hopes that Libertarians can overcome the ``hurdle of irrelevancy'' to offer a realistic alternative at the voting booth. Browne wants to abolish the IRS and replace the federal income tax with nothing; end Social Security, welfare, and any federal role in education or law enforcement; and ``pardon all non-violent'' drug offenders on his first day in office. Abortion and gay marriage, which Browne says are ``none of my business,'' would be unrestricted under a Libertarian Administration (think of it as the Clinton White House, only more so).  After ``clean[ing] up the mess,'' President Browne would go back home and enjoy life.

Bill Clinton can't afford to veto illegal-immigration controls in an election year. Bob Dole has based his California campaign on the GOP's tough stand on illegal immigration. So, where is the bill that both houses of Congress passed and sent to conference two months ago? The House leadership has put off announcing conferees while Republicans try to reach agreement -- but that may not come. Republican Sens. Arlen Specter (Pa.) and Orrin Hatch (Utah) believe that Washington <I>should</I> require the states to educate illegal aliens, that taxpayers <I>should</I> pay for welfare services for immigrants, and that the asylum system <I>should</I> continue to function as a back door for illegal immigration. If Dole is not serious enough about the issue to convince Specter and Hatch that his chances in California depend on it, then Clinton can carry the state without raising a sweat. The parties will blame each other for killing reform, but the real losers will be the American -- the legally American -- people.

More on black churches (see ``The Week,'' July 15). They say that black churches are being burned by racists. ``They,'' notes Michael Fumento in the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>, turn out to be one main source, the ultra-liberal Center for Democratic Renewal. (CDR's chairman, the Rev. C. T. Varian, avers as how ``There's only a slippery slope between conservative religious persons and those who are doing the burning.'') Meanwhile, statistics show the alleged epidemic to be an anomaly, the result of more states collecting data on church arsons. Among states that have compiled this information, says Fumento, the number of black-church burnings in 1994 (11) was actually lower than in 1990 (13). The number in 1991 (16) was the same as in 1995. Church burnings are up this year -- at white and black churches alike -- according to an Associated Press review. Black suspects were fingered in 9 of the 73 black-church arsons recorded over the past 18 months. Drunken teenagers and burglars are implicated in most of the others; in only 12 cases was racism a clear motivation. ``Let's stipulate that burning a church is evil,'' columnist James Glassman (who pioneered this skeptical coverage) wrote, adding: ``But we should also remember that this is an election year. And a fire makes an excellent political smokescreen.'' Amen.

Turkey's political crisis, festering since the parliamentary elections of last December, has produced an ominous result. Islamist Welfare Party leader Necmettin Erbakan is now prime minister, in a coalition with Tansu Ciller's secular True Path party, Mrs. Ciller's blood feud with a rival secular conservative party having guaranteed that the secular forces would not unite. Mrs. Ciller is deputy premier and foreign minister, and her party holds the national-security portfolios. Therefore, the link with the U.S. through NATO and the recent military-cooperation agreement with Israel theoretically remain intact, despite Mr. Erbakan's open hostility to both. Turkey is a strategically pivotal country, which has lately been playing a more active, moderating role in the Middle East and among the Turkic peoples of the former Soviet Union. Its internal crisis stems from the weakness of the secular parties (and from the political elite's cavalier treatment of the people's Islamic faith in the past). We can hope Mrs. Ciller's gamble pays off and that political Islamism will be successfully co-opted and tamed by power. But there is a risk -- and a serious one. Turkey's foreign policy, and crucial Western strategic interests, hang in the balance.

General William Tecumseh Sherman leveled the Virginia Military Institute stone by stone, during his victorious march through Lexington, Virginia. The U.S. Supreme Court, a leveler of a different kind, has ruled that the all-male VMI is unconstitutional (7 to 1, Justice Scalia dissenting, Justice Thomas abstaining -- his son goes to VMI). Same-sex public colleges are unconstitutional; same-sex marriages may soon be constitutional.

Mr. Clinton celebrated the Fourth of July with a glorious photo-op: the release of a three-year-old female bald eagle named, a bit too conveniently, Freedom. (The bird had been injured and was being returned to the wild after treatment.) Fly away, Freedom, fly! Soar high and free!! Away, away flew Freedom, higher, higher, and out of camera range, where she was attacked and downed by ospreys. Rescuers found the poor creature wounded anew and floundering around in a river, and took her back to the hospital.

<FONT SIZE=+3>J</FONT><font size=+1>AMES</font> Baker managed George Bush's campaign for the Senate in 1970 -- and lost. He managed Gerald Ford's campaign for President in 1976 -- and lost. He himself ran for attorney general of Texas in 1978 -- and lost. In 1980 he managed Bush's campaign for the Republican presidential nomination -- and lost. In 1988 he managed Bush's general-election campaign and won -- on the coattails of Ronald Reagan. Finally, he headed Bush's 1992 re-election campaign and saw his candidate garner the lowest percentage of the popular vote of any incumbent President since 1912. Baker, in short, is a political loser, adept chiefly at media leaks that help keep the hot air in his crazily overinflated reputation. He is also a legitimate candidate to be Bob Dole's running-mate.
<P>
To be sure, the odds are against Baker, who made his way into the vice-presidential sweepstakes via Bob Woodward's <I>The Choice</I>. But he is a plausible contender because he meets what will be Dole's two chief criteria for a running-mate, as related to Woodward. The first is that the VP nominee be a ``10,'' a figure accorded universal respect (from the media) and already prepared to step into the Presidency. (Dole rates himself as having been only a 7 as a candidate in 1976.) The other criterion is Dole's own comfort with the running-mate, suggesting a pick who is temperamentally moderate, an experienced Washington hand, and personally on good terms with Dole. Baker passes both tests.
<P> 
Less likely to fare well under the Dole tests are the candidates who would energize the party's conservative base. The two conservatives with national prominence, Jack Kemp and Bill Bennett, both badly fail the second Dole test, especially Kemp, who trampled all over Dole's cherished virtue of loyalty with his Keystone Kop endorsement of Steve Forbes earlier this year (Kemp couldn't even manage to stay loyal to Forbes). A long-shot favorite of conservative insiders, California Attorney General Dan Lungren, probably fails the instant-credibility test (see sidebar, next page, for more conservative possibilities). Dole's running-mate is likely to have a strong flavor of Dole, meaning the odds are he will reinforce the ticket's ideological timidity and grey personality rather than dispel it.
<P>
<B>The Governors:</B> Early vice-presidential speculation centered on governors, especially the gaggle of popular GOP governors in the Midwest. Now second-year Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge has become the hot prospect. From a working-class background, he attended Harvard on a scholarship and served with distinction in Vietnam. He's young (50), attractive, Catholic, and from a populous state; he proved -- first as a congressman in the Democratic 21st District, then in his 1994 gubernatorial election -- that he has cross-over appeal for conservative Democrats. His most glaring drawback is on abortion. Ridge is one of the Republican governors who oppose the GOP platform's pro-life plank. While he now supports Pennsylvania's Abortion Control Act, in 1993 he flirted with the Freedom of Choice Act, which would have barred Pennsylvania's package of restrictions. His nomination as the GOP gubernatorial candidate in 1994 prompted a run by a third-party pro-life candidate, who took a respectable 13 per cent of the vote.
<P>
As a congressman, Ridge was a regular moderate defector, part of the Northeastern tail that wagged the dog of the Republican conference. He was as likely to vote against Reagan and Bush as for them. As governor, he has leaned more to the right, making crime a top priority (he has signed death warrants the way a movie star signs autographs) and cutting business taxes. He undertook a major push last year to pass a far-reaching school-choice plan, which was defeated in the legislature twice (even though Ridge broke a campaign promise and signed a hefty legislative pay raise, a move widely interpreted as a way to help smooth the plan's passage). In his short tenure as governor Ridge has yet to leave much of an impression on the state's voters; his approval rating had slipped from the mid 60s last September to the mid 40s this April.
<P>
The governor Ridge supplanted in the Veepstakes is Michigan's John Engler. The 47-year-old solidly pro-life Catholic recently said his moment had passed for vice-presidential consideration. His failure to pass a military physical for Vietnam or to quickly explain the circumstances has hurt. But leaving aside the draft problem -- and the dumpy Engler's glaring charisma gap -- the Michigan governor is a formidable political figure: he has been a moving force behind the GOP's remarkable rise in his industrial, union-intensive state; he eliminated a $1.8-billion budget shortfall entirely with spending cuts his first year in office; he has been at the forefront of welfare reform (even if his successes have been oversold); and he has cut taxes repeatedly in the course of creating a business climate that has the state's unemployment rate lower than the national average for the first time in 16 years.
<P>
If Engler deserves another look, the Midwestern governor who doesn't is Ohio's George Voinovich, another pro-life Catholic from a large state. After taking office in 1992 Voinovich raised taxes by nearly $1 billion over two years. When, two years ago, voters repealed the 1992 tax on soda by initiative, he immediately suggested it might be best to re-impose it. He expressed dismay that Dole would seek to repeal Clinton's gas tax and recently opposed an effort to give some of Ohio's ballooning $1-billion budget surplus back to taxpayers until forced to by the legislature. While Voinovich nurtures an image of personal frugality, he has yet to extend his fiscal discipline to state government; spending is increasing at a clip roughly twice the rate of inflation. Choosing Voinovich would make sense only if Dole's idea of balancing the ticket is a VP whose instincts on taxes and spending are even worse than his own.
<P>
<B>The Senators:</B> Bob Dole's political nest, the U.S. Senate, is a likely breeding ground for Dole-amenable politicians. A leading contender is Arizona's pro-life and generally conservative John McCain. He would be Dole's Al Gore, a VP pick who would reinforce the nominee's strengths -- war hero, foreign-policy experience, a sense of ``adultness.''  But McCain's personal strengths are related to his weaknesses, as his perseverance often shades into stubbornness. Dealing with him was a constant frustration for the Gramm campaign, which had to pull him from the campaign trail at least twice (he broke with Gramm on Bosnia and recognition of Vietnam). McCain's advocacy of campaign-finance reform earlier this year was a classic demonstration of bull-headedness in the service of wrong-headedness, as he forced fellow Republicans to take up his baldly unconstitutional bill. To avoid having to stroke prickly personalities like McCain is one of the reasons Dole left the Senate for the campaign trail.
<P>
Besides McCain, the Senate offers a variety of other middling-to-long-shot picks:
<P>
-Connie Mack, the second-term senator from Florida, is a darling of supply-siders and acceptable to social conservatives. Tall, Catholic, easy-going, he is one of the emerging conservatives best prepared for prime time. Problems: Democratic Gov. Lawton Chiles would appoint a replacement, and Mack is not particularly close to Dole.
<P> 
-Missouri's John Ashcroft, a former governor, has emerged as one of the more activist freshman senators, with a series of substantive and imaginative welfare and tax reform proposals. He's a favorite of social conservatives. But Dole -- in any case unlikely to turn to a freshman -- probably still smarts over a tiff with Ashcroft over term limits last year.
<P>
-Indiana Sen. Dick Lugar, who won votes only from the media during this year's presidential primaries, passes Dole's credibility test. But he didn't impress anyone else by scrambling to fill the vacuum in the race left by Arlen Specter. His campaign style, meanwhile, seems to have been borrowed from  <I>Weekend at Bernie's</I>; his selection would mean a ticket of Dole and duller. 
<P>
-Some insiders call Oklahoma Sen. Don Nickles Dole's adopted son. Nickles is a Catholic with something of an evangelical air. The religious and fiscal Right both love him, and so does Dole (a rare confluence). Nickles was an early Dole backer in 1988 and Dole hoped he would be his replacement as Senate Majority Leader. He is a plausible dark horse.
<P>
<B>The Establishment</B>: Another pool of talent comes from the Washington GOP establishment, the former Administration officials and office-holders who make it their business to be 10s. Topping the list is Colin Powell, although he has ruled himself out so many times even the Dole camp seems to be giving up hope. Powell has the odd distinction of being the favorite GOP candidate of both Dole and U.S. Taxpayer Party founder Howard Phillips, who calculates a Powell pick would push into his arms a plausible third-party candidate like Pat Buchanan. At the very least Powell's selection would ensure a messy, politically damaging GOP convention.
<P>
The most attractive of the establishment contenders is Dick Cheney, who tends to be discounted because of his 1988 heart surgery (some joke that Cheney must be the favorite candidate of Speaker Newt Gingrich, third in the line of presidential succession). But Cheney had no health problems as defense secretary. He has credibility with the national media and with conservatives (who also love his wife, Lynne, former head of the National Endowment for the Humanities). His personality is reassuring, if sometimes Lugarishly dull. His brief exploratory run for the Presidency last year was notable only for its lack of ideas or energy. His tenure as defense secretary was in character too; post - Cold War defense policy on his watch was safe and reasoned, if unimaginative. Cheney's inclinations are those of a conservative who also once was President Ford's chief of staff.
<P>
A more dynamic establishment possibility is Carroll Campbell, the former two-term governor of South Carolina. Dole owes Campbell for his South Carolina primary victory. Campbell left office with an approval rating in the 70s, after pursuing a Lamar Alexander - like agenda of economic development (spurred by a variety of tax incentives) and government reform; the size of government, meanwhile, went untouched. Campbell has the vivacity of a New South politician, but also the vague sense of untrustworthiness of one. He has strained relations with the South Carolina Christian Right, which correctly senses he is not one of them and also bridles under a variety of slights -- perceived or real -- from Campbell's years of brokering its rise to power in the party. (The pro-life Campbell was almost denied a slot as a convention delegate this year.) His current million-dollar-a-year job would disqualify him as a running-mate for some candidates, but probably not Dole, who if he were offended by Washington operators would have to jettison most of his entourage.
<P>
The ultimate in operators is James Baker. The former Secretary of State has no constituency -- except the national media. ``Baker makes it onto short lists because he's a master at leaking,'' observes <I>Human Events</I> editor John Gizzi. Reaganites hate him for his self-serving stroking of the media and the way he manipulated his way through staff infighting. His only ideology is power. He claims to be pro-life, but on <I>Meet the Press</I> in 1994 he equivocated: ``even though I ran on a right-to-life-amendment platform [in Texas] I find it a little difficult to understand, as a conservative, the government taking that kind of an activist approach in personal lives.'' Editorial boards would swoon over a Baker pick, but Dole surely has observed Baker enough to know loyalty isn't in his vocabulary. If Dole selected Baker and his poll numbers continued to sag, by mid September Baker would quietly be telling reporters it really wasn't his decision to join the ticket.
<P>
The Dole campaign is keeping vice-presidential deliberations close to its chest, with long-time Dole friend Bob Ellsworth handling the selection process. There are a range of dark horses who could still emerge: Wisconsin Gov. Tommy Thompson, yet another pro-life, Catholic, Midwestern governor; the young and energetic deficit hawk, House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich; Dole Republican par excellence Donald Rumsfeld, the former Illinois congressman tapped by the Dole campaign to handle policy. But chances are Dole won't stray too far afield. When Ellsworth floated Democratic Sen. Sam Nunn, it was an ``outside-the-box'' name that was as inside-the-box as you can get: a Senate insider, a mushy moderate, a political bore. Dole's talk of picking a pro-choicer, meanwhile, is probably meant only to establish his independence for the media (see below for more on Christine Todd Whitman et al.). The first dictum of vice-presidential selection, they say, is, Do no harm. Dole is likely to follow it in his own way, and pick someone who will do no harm he isn't already capable of himself.

<H2>Self-Corrections Welcome</H2></CENTER>

<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, JULY 2
<P>











Last week, the <I>New York Times</I> celebrated its one-hundredth anniversary under its current regime. To get it said, yet again: It is the greatest news institution in the history of the world, in the absence of which many of us would stumble about as if without arms or legs.
<P>
A truly fine aspect of the <i>Times</i> is its ever so careful writing into the record of corrections of its own bad moments. These, unhappily, are very bad moments. In the Thirties, Walter Duranty told the world that there was nothing whatever to worry about, never mind those reports about the starvation of the Kulaks by Josef Stalin. Abundant coverage, in later years, was given to those and other crimes of Stalin.
<P>
Two weeks ago, appropriately on its one-hundredth birthday, the <i>Times</I> gave us two self-corrections, in the Book Review and in the articles section. In the Book Review a remarkable review by Terry Teachout of Joan Mellen's biography, <I>Hellman and Hammett: The Legendary Passion of Lillian Hellman and Dashiell Hammett</I>. Mr. Teachout is devastating in his exploration of Miss Hellman's lifelong infatuation with Soviet Communism.
<P>
Lillian Hellman's review of her own political career had been published in 1976, called <I>Scoundrel Time</I>. It was hailed on the front page of the <I>Times</I> Book Review as a work comparable to those of Thoreau and Emerson. Similar notice of it was taken in the <I>Washington Post</I>, and the <I>Chicago Tribune</I>. Only Hilton Kramer, then an art critic at the <I>Times</I>, demurred. Miss Hellman had presented herself as the soul of courage and resolution, the Joan of Arc of the McCarthy era. What she was was a lovesick child of Josef Stalin and an unpleasant human being.
<P>
The next week, in its Sunday magazine, the <I>Times</I> published photographs taken during the reign of Mao in China (by Li Zhen Sheng). They are mostly pictures of people being shot and tortured. The text is by Edward Gargan, Hong Kong bureau chief of the <I>Times</I>, who records that ``more than 50 million people starved to death in the vast famine [Mao] visited on his country in 1960 and 1961,'' and that was five years before the Cultural Revolution - ``ten years of madness, forced labor, exile, countless suicides, and millions of killings.''
<P>
We know all that, don't we? ``Throughout,'' the <I>Times</I>'s Mr. Gargan goes on, ``Mao was labeled a 'genius' for the cataclysm wrought in his name. And wave after wave of credulous American Sinologists and journalists wrote infatuated accounts of the Cultural Revolution, celebrating their perception of China's transformation.''
<P>
Who was the most celebrated figure in the <I>New York Times</I>'s journalistic hierarchy? Before, during, and after the Cultural Revolution? James Reston, of course. In 1971, writing from Tokyo after a visit to China (where his appendix was removed), Reston wrote, ``I'm a Scotch Calvinist. I believe in redemption of the human spirit and the improvement of man. Maybe it's because I believe that or I want to believe it that I was struck by the tremendous effort to bring out what is best in man, what makes them good, what makes them cooperate with one another and be considerate and not beastly to one another. They are trying that.''
<P>
Reston's eulogy disintegrated in the memory after such as Max Frankel and Abe Rosenthal descended on China. But it was the capstone of the pro-Mao sentiment in the <I>Times</I>, even as Herbert Matthews's tribute in 1961 was the high-water mark of the <I>Times</I>'s enthusiasm for Fidel Castro.
<P>
The <I>Times</I>'s historical corrections are done without acts of contrition. Rather like the thief who sends the money back in an anonymous package. Institutions have a difficult time apologizing for themselves. Vatican II was exceptional in this respect, when the Pope apologized for past acts of hostility to the Jews.
<P>
But it is different where individuals, not institutions, are the critical players. It is a pity that, before he died, Reston did not take any of a thousand opportunities to remark his own delusions. Garry Wills is very much alive and very quick to notice other people's moral/political indiscretions, in fact, sometimes quicker than the indiscretions. In his 34-page introduction he treated Lillian Hellman's book like a modern <I>Areopagitica</I>. Garry Wills's reading of history, as of 1977: ``A newly aggressive Truman had launched the Cold War in the spring of 1947, with his plan to 'rescue' Greece and Turkey . . . We had still a world to save, with just those plans -- from NATO to the Korean War.'' At the time, I observed, in <B>NATIONAL REVIEW</B>, that Wills's introduction to Hellman might have been written in the Lenin Institute. Perhaps on his one-hundredth birthday, Garry Wills will show the courage of the <I>New York Times</I>.

Dear Rusty,
<P>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->


<BR>
<BR>

Okay, we all know cigarettes are addictive. I mean, Tip smoked up a storm for years, and when she quit, well, she kind of got on the old replace-the-cigarette-with-a-Hostess-Ho-Ho train. At a certain point, I was thinking about a firmly worded offer: either a carton of Carlton Lights or a NordicTrack, but definitely one or the other.
<P>
But they're bad little cancer sticks, aren't they? I mean, it says so on the box.
<P>
On the other hand, of course -- and as you know, as a New Democrat, I think it's important to look at the other hand -- $72,000 in Democratic Party funds divided into six checks of $12,000 apiece to six swing states (say, for argument's sake, California, Ohio, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Florida, and New York) -- well, I mean, that's a positive, right? So while cigarettes are addictive, they're also beneficial.
<P>
As you know, Rusty, I'm very sensitive to the issue of hypocrisy. You remember how hard I fought to have an electric vice-presidential limousine -- and I only gave in when the Secret Service pointed out the problem, in an emergency, of a car that can only go 30 miles per hour for 11 minutes before it needs a recharge. Naturally, I'm all in favor of pointing out the differences between us and the Republicans -- especially these days, when they're harder to find. And tobacco policy seems a good place to start. After all, they got $97,000 in tobacco-lobby contributions last year, while we took in only $96,890.
<P>
But as I was helping George Stephanopoulos into his ``Buttman'' suit -- you've seen him in the news, I'm sure: a guy in tights and a cigarette costume waving at all the Dole rallies; boy, is George racking up the frequent-flyer miles! -- I suddenly thought that we may be pushing this issue too far.
<P>
I had just zipped on the filter headpiece and heard George's muffled ``How do I look?'' when the phone rang. It was Dad, calling from the farm.
<P>
``Son,'' he said, ``your mother and I just caught you on the news.'' 
<P>
``How did I look?'' I asked. I always like to get Dad's thoughts on my campaigning style. 
``Well, your mother thinks you look fat.''
<P> 
``Oh,'' I said.
<P> 
``But I've got a question for you. Just let me put down my julep.''
<P>
I heard the familiar sounds: the ice tinkling, the slippery noise of fingers on the outside of a glass, the thud of the drink hitting the coaster.
<P>
``Here's my question, boy. All those years growing up on a farm in Tennessee -- remember?'' 
<P>
``Sure, Dad. They're some of my fondest memories. Not that I didn't enjoy the years growing up in a hotel in Washington, D.C., of course -- but a Tennessee farm is a much better campaign backdrop.'' I laughed. Dad joined in with a few chuckles.
<P>
``Right you are, my boy. And do you remember what it was that we grew on that farm?''
<P>
``Mint?'' I asked, stymied.
``Well, yeah, mint. Of course mint. But come on, boy, we had thousands of acres -- your mother and I couldn't get through that many mint juleps in one planting season . . . Now, maybe, since I'm not working, but then -- no way.''
<P> 
``Then I'm stumped, Dad. What did we grow?'' 
<P>
``I'll give you a clue: it's leafy, highly addictive, and kids think it's cool.''
<P>
I went pale. ``Good heavens! Marijuana?'' I was shaking. This was the kind of thing that Dole's opposition-research people would love.
<P>
``No, silly,'' Dad said. ``We grew tobacco.'' 
<P>
``Dad! That's worse! We've been highlighting Bob Dole's ties to the cigarette industry.''
<P>
``Hello?'' Dad said. ``This is why I'm calling. Add it up, kiddo. St. Albans. Harvard. Your first campaign. Talk about tobacco money! Whoo boy!''
<P>
``Well, thanks for calling, Dad,'' I said. ``I'm going to have to think about this.''
<P>
``My advice, son, is when and if the press asks you about it, just tell 'em the truth: you didn't inhale!'' Dad giggled merrily and hung up.
<P>
I looked up from the phone in a daze. George was still in his ``Buttman'' costume, bouncing along the wall feeling for the door. ``Is everything okay at home?'' he asked in a barely audible muffle.
<P>
``Fine, fine,'' I said. I didn't want to disturb him.
<P>
``Well then,'' he said from under his filter, ``could you please show me to the door? It's getting awfully sweaty under here.''
<P>
I guided him out. Then I sat down at my desk and started to think. I needed some peace and quiet, some small moment of contemplation. What I needed, Rusty, was a cigarette.
<P>
I had a Snickers bar instead.

Hard to believe, but there it was: a Democrat standing on the House floor pointing at a chart showing how Republicans have reversed President Clinton's success at reducing the deficit. Odder still, he wasn't making it up. The budget resolution recently passed by congressional Republicans includes a spike in the deficit, which is projected to be larger both in 1997 and 1998 than this year. There are innocent explanations for the hiccup, chiefly that the deficit dipped lower than expected this year (perhaps as low as $130 billion). But for Republicans who have made actuarial decreases in the deficit their Holy Grail, it is embarrassing. More embarrassing still, when it seemed that the Energy - Water appropriations bill (the source of ample funding for New Mexico) would have to be cut, Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici (R., N.M.) simply added $5 billion more to the overall budget. House Republicans went along, some openly exulting when extra money made its way into their districts. (The first effort by House freshmen to trim back the extra funding with a 1.9 per cent cut in the Interior appropriation bill won just 128 votes.) Some of this is understandable; these are politicians, after all, who have to win re-election. But higher deficits seem to be a dubious way to do it.

Many Americans who harbored doubts about the wisdom of anointing Colin Powell Vice President nevertheless hoped he would bring his dignified leadership into the political arena in some other capacity. These well-wishers have reason to be dismayed by the general's one recent foray into public policy. In a speech at Bowie State University, he announced his opposition to the California Civil Rights Initiative to repeal race and gender preferences. People of good will can, of course, take this position, but Powell refused to extend such courtesy to the other side. And he revealed himself to be woefully misinformed about the initiative. He thinks, for instance, that it would endanger outreach programs, whereas in fact it would affect only racially (or sexually) preferential outreach programs. Now Ward Connerly, the chairman of the CCRI campaign, has written, both in sorrow and in anger, a response to Powell. Connerly observes that Powell's best-selling book condemned preferential affirmative action, which is the only type of affirmative action that the CCRI would ban. Powell the author wrote that preferences stigmatize recipients, but Powell the speaker calls that argument ``nonsense.'' Writes Connerly, ``Frankly, I like the author better.'' Connerly calls Powell ``a genuine American hero,'' but Connerly himself has displayed uncommon courage in his principled campaign. It is a mark of Republican dishonor that Connerly has been left to fight this battle alone.

Arthur A. Coia, general president of the Laborers' Union of North America (LUNA), has contributed nearly $400,000 to the Democratic National Committee (thereby making the party's ``top ten'' list with plenty of room to spare), given in excess of $3 million to various Democratic politicians since 1993, loaned $100,000 to the Clinton inaugural committee, and sent one seriously expensive hand-made golf club to the President. Why the gifts? In 1994, the Justice Department drafted a 212-page complaint charging the union with racketeering and heavy ties to organized crime, and threatened to take the union under government control. But a closed-door meeting between Coia and the Justice Department resulted in a one-sided agreement leaving Coia in charge and with complete control of LUNA's reforms- not to be reviewed until 1998. Rep. Bill McCollum (R., Fla.), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee's crime subcommittee, plans to hold hearings on this sweetheart deal in the fall. Another FOB-SOB.

Dick Armey wants a flat tax. His major opponents may be not the class-warfare mavens of the Left but a decidedly upscale Beltway group: lobbyists. According to the House Majority Leader's report, the 67,000-man lobbying industry is the largest private-sector employer in D.C., accounting for one-sixth of the District's workforce. Plot the growth in the number of words in the tax code alongside growth in the number of lobbyists, and you'll see that both have more than tripled since 1964. That's no coincidence. Even in this era of spending cuts, nothing attracts special pleaders like the tax code. So how to jettison the tax code's bells and whistles? With 125 lobbyists for each congressman, a frontal assault won't work. We propose a special 0 per cent tax rate for lobbyists -- to be enacted when they agree not to obstruct flat-tax legislation for the rest of us.

Fuaziya Kasinga of Togo was granted political asylum in the United States on the grounds that the practice of female genital mutilation in Togo constitutes persecution. Genital mutilation is an appalling practice, but we need to distinguish between brutal societies and official oppression. If mutilation in their home countries entitles foreigners to asylum in the United States, then half the women of Africa and many in the Middle East could come here. What about girls caught in the prostitution industry of Southeast Asia? Untouchables and bonded laborers in India? To paraphrase John Quincy Adams, we are the friends of civilization everywhere, but the guarantors only of our own.

Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty give Central Europe and the former Soviet Union reliable news about the region. While the Soviet Empire is no more, freedom of the press in all these countries is precarious once again, with ex- and neo-Communists making their comeback and even Boris Yeltsin turning the Russian media into an organ of state power. A Washington conference on June 19, hosted by <B><I>NR</I></B>, the Nixon Center for Peace and Freedom, and the Center for Security Policy -- and attended by Senators Jon Kyl (R., Ariz.) and Joe Biden (D., Del.), Steve Forbes (former head of the Board for International Broadcasting), and Michael Zantovsky (former journalist and dissident, now Czech ambassador to the United States) -- concluded that the radios were still doing indispensable work. Yet Radio Free Europe's Hungarian service has been canceled for lack of funds, and unless another $1 million is found before September 30 the Czech service will be doomed as well. Congress, take note.

The largest American Protestant organization, the Southern Baptist Convention, has adopted a resolution calling for efforts to convert Jews to Christianity. Naturally this roiled the waters, occasioning outrage among some Jews. For such outrage there are understandable reasons: 1) efforts to convert Jews in centuries past often involved the sword rather than the word; 2) historically Christianity often demonized the Jew as an outsider or worse; and 3) the shadow of the Holocaust looms over all such matters. However, Christians from their side may decently answer that: 1) since they regard the doctrines of Christianity as true <I>and</I> universal, it would be a failure of <I>caritas</I>, without which life is as a tinkling cymbal, not to share them with all people; and 2) they do not see any reason to exclude their Jewish neighbors from the inclusive term ``all people.'' While overbearing attempts at evangelizing are spiritually disgraceful, the polite, considerate effort to share Christian claims with one's neighbors should threaten no one -- least of all, devout Jews.

<FONT SIZE=+3>A</FONT> <font size=+1>FEW</font> weeks ago I went back to see my old high school in Washington, D.C. In those days (I graduated in 1967) it was called Western High School, and was integrated <i>de facto</i> as well as <i>de jure</i>, with a roughly even balance of black and white students. The building, nearly a century old, was a little run down, and we had to scrape up money from our parents to keep the school newspaper going, but you could get an education there. We went to Harvard, Stanford, Tufts, the service academies, and other good schools. The middle-class white and black kids were in the same school activities, behaved equally badly at the same parties, and believed in the same government-issue Great Society politics. We all knew Marion Barry, then a local hustler on the rise who was just hitching a ride on the politics game.
<P>
Western is now the Duke Ellington School of the Arts. Much has been added, and much taken away. The most telling sign, I decided, were the clocks in the classrooms. They're the same clocks we had, and they've all stopped. The people in charge of the school have spent thousands of dollars on an elaborate closed-circuit TV system to tell the students about the week's special events, but didn't think some fraction of that should have been spent on teaching the kids to show up on time. And, indeed, the students wander around pretty aimlessly, I suppose waiting for the producers of <i>Fame II</i> to sign them up.
<p>
They're being cheated, of course, as they will find out after some very cruel lessons. So is everyone else living in the District of Columbia. The city, now in receivership for the second time in its history (the first occasion was in the 1870s), is a poster child for a 12-step program to kick Government Abuse.
<P>
A decade ago, D.C. seemed to be on the way to becoming, if not a state, then the political equal of the states. Now the city is being run by what is universally called the control board- formally, The District of Columbia Financial Responsibility and Management Assistance Authority. It is slowly attacking the most egregious fraud and mismanagement. Its charter is to balance the budget in the next three years. It may succeed, if the tax base doesn't shrink any faster than its present rate.
<P>
But while the control board may give comfort to the holders of D.C.'s $3.5 billion of bonded debt, it cannot revive the city. Only a restored civil society with a middle class anxious to defend its families and property can do that.
<P> 
Most of the people now living in Washington are welfare recipients, D.C. government workers, or criminals, and their dependents. They are all opposed to the reforms needed to save the city.
<P>
According to the most recent <I>Washington Post</I> poll, conducted between  May 16 and 19, Mayor Marion Barry has a ``good'' or ``excellent'' rating of 52 per cent. When asked if Barry was ``trying realistically to deal with the city's problems'' 70 per cent said he was. Not that there isn't some dissent: In an earlier Post poll, conducted in February, 60 per cent of D.C. residents said that Barry's proposed cutbacks in the unbelievably bloated city government are a ``bad idea.''
<P>
What can you say? Most of the people, white, black, or whatever, who don't take the majority line have left town. They don't want to pay the taxes for nonexistent services, and are appalled by the schools and terrified of the crime. In 1970 there were 757,000 residents; today there are 540,000.
<P>
Now if nature were to take its course, the place would soon crumble, be abandoned by its surviving inhabitants, and then be excavated by puzzled archaeologists some centuries hence. It has happened before. But D.C. was formed by the Federal Government, which is constitutionally committed to the place; it cannot strike camp as a private employer or property owner might.
<P>
Until now, under both Democratic and Republican Administrations and Congresses, the response to problems in the District has been to fund another program or two. But in the past year, a tectonic plate has shifted. Eleanor Holmes Norton, the non-voting D.C. Delegate to Congress and a member of the city's black political elite, has put forward a bill to cut federal taxes on residents' local income to a flat 15 per cent, with exemptions of $15,000 for single filers and $30,000 for joint filers. Last year, District residents paid about $1.6 billion in federal taxes; Mrs. Norton's bill would cut that by an estimated $750 million. There is a precedent for this sort of tax break. Guam, American Samoa, and Puerto Rico also have limited self-government and representation in Washington, and their residents pay no federal income taxes.
<P>
<font size=+3>T</font><font size=+1>HERE</font> is a popular perception in the rest of the country that Washington is a nest of ill-gotten wealth and privilege. Privilege? Yes. Ill gotten? In many cases. But wealth? Last year, there were only 4,300-odd taxpayers in the District who earned $200,000 or more. What if their tax liability were to be cut by more than a third? Think some of their friends might move into town? As for the core middle class, there were only about 75,000 taxpayers in the District with family incomes between $30,000 and $75,000. If the better-off are the ones who might start new enterprises, the people in the middle are the ones who will harass the school board, the police, and the City Council into delivering real services.
<P>
To add to the lure, the Norton plan would retain the mortgage-interest deduction and the charitable deductions. The frosting: there would be no capital-gains tax on investments in D.C. by D.C. residents. The Norton bill would be the camel's nose in the tent for a national flat tax. And it would help transform the terms of debate in the black middle class, which now sees itself as dependent on government jobs and affirmative action.
<P>
Of course Mrs. Norton doesn't represent herself as a born-again conservative. ``I am a hard-core Democrat and a hard-core liberal,'' she says. She supports the National Education Association in its unbending opposition to a voucher program for the District's schools, and says of her proposal, ``I am not calling this a flat tax because that suggests it is not progressive. I am calling it a uniform tax.'' Whatever. She is realistic about the essential problem of the District. ``The D.C. government has an attitude. Nothing will work unless it is reformed agency by agency, which is where the waste is. The police need to be made more effective. The control board's plan to cut 10,000 jobs (about a quarter of the city payroll) is a good one.''
<P>
There are about 15,000 bills introduced in Congress every year, and only a small fraction see the light of day. The District is a pretty unpopular cause in Congress. Even when Democrats are in control, key legislation concerning the city tends to pass by narrow margins.
<P>
Even in this basically hostile climate, a surprisingly high level of support has built up for the D.C. flat tax. ``The Speaker is interested in it,'' says Mrs. Norton, ``and he's sent a memo to Bill Archer at Ways and Means asking how it can be moved along. Victor Fazio, the chair of the Democratic caucus, has become a co-sponsor.'' Before leaving the Senate, Bob Dole had offered to get the bill through the upper chamber if it passed the House- a good omen.
<P>
It is not, however, a lock. Republican House Members, particularly the newer ones, don't like to think about Washington, and tend to defer to the two or three people in the caucus who have the principal responsibility for D.C. affairs. Their support for a D.C. flat tax is conditioned on seeing reforms in the city government.
<P>
Tom Davis (R., Va.) is the chairman of the House District Affairs Committee. He is a freshman from neighboring Fairfax County, where he became head of the county government while working as an executive with a technology company. ``This city still has an entitlement/victim mentality,'' he sighs. ``And most of the crimes are being committed against the people who are fighting the changes we're trying to make in the justice system.'' For Davis's constituents, D.C. is a local issue, which tends to come down to its contribution to the region's crime rate. ``Every other jurisdiction is moving away from parole, because 60 per cent of crimes are committed by 3 per cent of the prisoners. But parole in D.C. is almost automatic, and Barry got a lot of support in the last election by making a play for the votes of offenders' families and friends.'' There are one and a half times as many prisoners now in the District's Lorton Reformatory as there are taxpayers in the $200,000-and-up group.
<P>
``At a minimum we want to see regulatory reform so that the city would have the welcome mat out for business,'' Davis says. ``The problem now is that the District's reputation is bringing down the whole region.''
<P>
In the end, Davis tends to support the bill. ``I think it's something we can do. But I want to see some other changes, not just in criminal justice, but in cutting waste and destructive regulations, along with some tax reform by the city.''
<P>
The flat tax would also need to have the support of James T. Walsh (R., N.Y.), a former phone-company executive who represents Syracuse. Walsh was the City Council president of Syracuse, and is able to make embarrassing comparisons with his home town. ``The city is only about three times the size of Syracuse, which has a budget of $330 million. Even if you triple that, and add in the corrections and social services the state provides in New York, you don't come anywhere near the $5 billion the District spends. In Syracuse the city council has a staff of 3. Here it's over 80. When they announce cuts in spending, those are only announcements.''
<P>
Walsh is a classic American can-do  type in a can't-do place, and he is not happy with his part-time home. ``Of course I leave my family at home in Syracuse. Why would I live here?'' Even so, he'll support the flat tax if certain conditions are met. ``I am willing to do this, but not for the heck of it. I want to see some behavioral changes here, including a balanced budget.''
<P>
We can't move the government to a less expensive facility in Plano, Texas, or Southfield, Michigan, or any of the other places corporate America has fled to in recent decades. D.C. needs a jump start, and the flat tax would do it. No, it's not entirely fair to reward the city before the rest of the country, but it could provide a testing ground for a tax-and-spend-less philosophy that could be <i>transplanted</i> to the rest of the country.

<H2>The Kemp Manifesto</H2></CENTER>

<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, JUNE 21
<P>

The movements of Jack Kemp are always worth watching. For many years he was dismissed as a football jock who had stumbled onto Adam Smith and remained starstruck. But after a few terms in the House of Representatives he won grudging admiration, in part because of his comprehensive grasp of the economic scene, in part because of his rhetorical fluency. Ronald Reagan aside, it has been for many years Jack Kemp who has had the ability to ignite enthusiasm in those whom he addresses.
<P>
Kemp's political judgment, however, has never been very good. It is generally agreed by specialists that he could have defeated Governor Cuomo the second time around in 1986 and that if he had done so he'd have been perfectly placed to bid for the presidential nomination in 1988. He gave up his congressional seat to contend for the presidential nomination and, for reasons unknown and unknowable, left his legal residence in New York in favor of Maryland, where he lived while serving as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development for President Bush. If he had stayed in New York he'd have been nominated for governor, would have defeated Mr. Cuomo, and would almost certainly be the candidate for President at the moment.
<P>
But his political prescriptions have always been sound, and this week he published in the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> a manifesto of sorts. In it he made an unusual proposal.
<P>
But first, the launch. Mr. Kemp argues that the country is wearing itself out with the partisanship that is built into existing economic policies. This is likely to go on with the rough division we have got used to. The Democrats are associated with welfare, the Republicans with tax reform. They argue but without a common vocabulary, says Mr. Kemp. If what is desired is to provide for the underclass, the most painless way to do this is to encourage growth in the economy. That growth can't happen under our suffocating tax structure.
<P>
Mr. Kemp asks for a truce on the welfare front. Leave it alone. In return he asks for a solid, architectural reform in our tax policies. 
<P>
What is especially original in his concrete proposals is his assumption that the President of the United States is empowered himself to take two drastic courses of action.
<P>
The first is to instruct the Secretary of the Treasury to index capital gains. The assumption is that indexation is a matter of purely clerical concern, that you should not need a congressional Act to instruct the Secretary of the Treasury to do something as obvious as not to charge for spurious increases in the value of land or stock or other property.
<P>
But Mr. Kemp goes further. He would have the new President instruct the Treasury Secretary to ``stabilize the dollar value of the nation's gold reserves, say within a $30 band.'' Such action would ``reinstate the dollar/gold link'' that was broken in 1971 and that led to the worst inflation in the century.
<P>
If we reason backwards, we have a right to assume that if what Nixon did he had the authority to do, then to undo what Nixon did another President would have the authority to do.
<P> 
Mr. Kemp then says: Look now at what would happen. For every 1 per cent decrease in the interest rate, $50 billion is lopped off the annual burden of the national debt. With capital gains indexed, a flood of realism pours into the marketplace, affecting farms and apartments and portfolios. It is another question how high genuine capital gains should be taxed -- that would be a congressional decision.
<P>
And as for the tax code, the new President having used his own authority to take the two measures here outlined, let Congress proceed to work out a new system inspired by the flat-tax principle recommended by the Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform that Jack Kemp headed up last year.
<P>
Here is a fresh view, filling the lungs with hope and excitement. Mr. Dole is uniquely in a position to act on the Kemp manifesto. He could, just to begin with, endorse the two major proposals for executive action. And, in a spirit of bipartisanship, he could say that he would suspend any call for reducing existing welfare measures, testing whether the fiscal reforms had the effect of diminishing the heavy weight of welfare on the budget. And Mr. Dole could make a second, equally exciting move by announcing that he intended to name Jack Kemp as vice-presidential candidate.

Dear Rusty,
<P>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->


<BR>
<BR>

I was working late one night -- watching tapes of Christie Whitman's debates with Jim Florio (don't know why; just interested, I guess) -- and I lost track of time. I was heading out of the West Wing in the usual way when I suddenly remembered the most recent memo from the White House Office of Security, following the discovery of some Rose Law Firm billing records in the Book Room. ``From now on,'' the memo went, ``all White House personnel are hereby required to pass through the Book Room no fewer than three (3) times in any    twenty-four (24) hour period. For those staff unaware of the Book Room's location, it's up the back stairs, down the main corridor, through the small butler's door on the right, along the crawlspace, and through the door at the back of the closet. When entering and exiting, please take care not to disturb Mrs. Rodham Clinton.''
<P> 
Of course, I didn't need directions. But when I reached the door, I heard the faint tinkling of bells. And I could smell incense. So I knocked.
<P> 
A deep-voiced female called out: ``What undead spirit walks the earth? What lifeless vision knocks?''
<P> 
I cleared my throat. ``Um, it's me. Al Gore.''
<P> 
``Eleanor? Is it you?'' asked a familiar voice. ``Eleanor? The forces are against me, just as they were against you! The conservatives and the reactionaries don't understand. Help me, Eleanor!''
<P> 
I cleared my throat again. ``No, not 'Elean-Or.' 'Al Gore.''' 
<P>
A silence. Then the deep-voiced woman: ``Mr. Vice President, is it you?''
<P>
``Yep,'' I answered. 
<P>
``But your voice . . . it sounds so masculine. I could have sworn it was Eleanor Roosevelt's.''
<P>
 The door was unlocked by HRC. The Book Room was lit by six flickering candles. A large woman in a kaftan sat fanning a deck of cards.
<P>
``Okay, Al, you caught me,'' HRC said. ``I was trying to contact some voices from the other side. ``Please promise me that you won't tell a soul.''
 
``Well,'' I said, ``if you'd prefer to keep it quiet, I'll respect that. But I think you're missing a chance. The American people are very interested in spiritual experiences. In my book, I was very open about the time halfway through an Indian sweat lodge that I floated out of my body and back to Washington to talk to the statue of Lincoln. And no one thought I was weird.'' 
<P>
``Really?''
 <P>``Really,'' I said. ``Besides, the Book Room has been the site of so many unexplained phenomena, I don't think one little seance will upset people.''
<P> 
``Good point,'' she said. ``I mean, isn't it possible that some mischievous spirit . . . A poltergeist! What if a poltergeist put the billing records in this room?''
<P>
``Well,'' I said, ``have you talked to a poltergeist tonight?'' 
<P>
``Nope,'' HRC answered. ``Just Eleanor Roosevelt and Mahatma Gandhi.''
<P>
I thought about this. I think it's safe to rule Gandhi out -- unfamiliarity with U.S. trial rules, for one thing; the fact that practical joking is essentially ``active'' and not ``passive,'' for another. And it didn't seem likely that the spirit of Eleanor Roosevelt committed any funny business with the Rose Law Firm billing records. On the other hand, I wouldn't put it past her to request an FBI file or two -- she's from the old school, when they were awfully lax about stuff like that. Still -- who knows how many undead shades might be lurking around. (Nixon came immediately to mind.) 
<P>
``You know what, Al?'' HRC said. ``I will tell people about my seances. Maybe the American people will understand.'' She turned to the woman. ``Mrs. Houston, let's try another spirit.''
<P> 

``Do you mind if I sit in?'' I asked.
<P> 
Mrs. Houston peered at me. ``So often,'' she said, ``the presence of another strong life form disrupts the ability to contact the spirit realm.'' She looked deep into my eyes. ``Lucky for us,'' she went on, ``that won't be a problem here.''
<P>
We took our seats and held hands. Silence.
<P>
Then we heard faint footsteps. ``What apparition comes to haunt us?'' Mrs. Houston cried. 
<P>
From the shadows of the Book Room came an undead-sounding voice: ``Good evening.''
<P>
The three of us started. ``What horrifying vision is before us?'' Mrs. Houston cried.
<P>
``Um, it's me, Warren Christopher.'' And, indeed, it was. ``I was just on my way out.''
<P> 
He slipped out, but by that time, the spell was broken. I went home. But the image of HRC stuck in my mind. Rusty, so many people think of her as some kind of Lady Macbeth. But let me ask you: Did Lady Macbeth talk to ghosts?

When Bob Dole announced that he would not ``seek or accept a retreat'' from the anti-abortion plank in the Republican platform, but that he wanted to add a ``declaration of tolerance'' acknowledging differences of opinion among Republicans, he hit upon a compromise that satisfied nearly everyone. But he could not leave well enough alone. Most pro-lifers thought this declaration should appear in the platform's preamble: plenty of other planks inspire disagreement among Republicans, so why single out abortion? Dole campaign officials assured pro-lifers that their point was well taken. A few days later, Dole gratuitously remarked that the declaration should go in the abortion plank. Ralph Reed, Gary Bauer, Pat Buchanan, et al. instantly promised a convention fight. Dole retaliated with a counterproductive attack on Gary Bauer. In less than a week, what had seemed a political masterstroke was transformed into a debacle. A convention fight over this issue would be the worst of all worlds. Viewers would be left scratching their heads as Dan Rather told them that intolerance had prevented Republicans from finding common ground. Ideally the issue should be resolved before then. Pro-choice Republicans must decide whether their aims are to raise money and get free publicity, or to help Bob Dole get elected by keeping the social conservatives on board. And Dole must force himself to engage this issue at the principled level it demands. Until he gets a grip, he and his party will continue to fumble.

President Clinton approved Wisconsin's welfare plan. Next: proposing a 50 per cent tax cut, sending the 82nd Airborne to the Rio Grande for border patrol, smoking a cigar in the White House, and promising to enlist in the Marines once he leaves office.

When former Colorado governor Richard Lamm showed a willingness to be the presidential candidate of the Reform Party, speculation naturally focused on the willingness of Ross Perot, the Reform Party's proprietor, to let him. The more interesting question is what a Lamm candidacy would do to the dynamics of the race. ``America needs more than a new President,'' Lamm says. ``It needs a whole new political culture.'' He is a sort of Anti-Demagogue whose ideal political culture is a blunt fight about hard spending issues, primarily entitlements aimed at the elderly: ``There is something wrong with a society,'' Lamm likes to say, that spends 61 per cent of the federal budget on people over 65. Lamm was also the first prominent politician to speak out against unchecked immigration. Tax policy and cultural issues seem to be terrae incognitae, and his notorious remark that Americans have a ``duty to die'' would -- and should -- be often thrown at him. But a candidate of hard choices would be anathema to Bill Clinton, and a prod to Bob Dole not to look for votes in the mushy middle.

Republicans may be throwing away one of their best chances to pick up both a Senate seat and a good senator. Arkansas Lieutenant Governor Mike Huckabee was set to wage a strong campaign for the seat of retiring Democratic Sen. David Pryor, but Gov. Jim Guy Tucker's Whitewater conviction and resignation left him with more pressing duties. The best remaining candidate, by a large margin, is sophomore Rep. Tim Hutchinson. Hutchinson is an affable and principled conservative, and was a Contract with America Republican avant la lettre. He is hesitating because of internal Arkansas GOP maneuvers. Republican leaders, both nationally and in Arkansas, should do everything in their power to coax him to run.<p>

In his Princeton commencement address, President Clinton proposed giving families with a kid in college a two-year $1,500 tax credit and a $10,000 deduction. ``Our goal must be nothing less than to make the 13th and 14th years of education as universal to all Americans as the first 12 are today,'' he said. This is a terrific political move and a terrible idea. It will be manna from Washington to hard-pressed middle-class parents facing huge college bills. But the United States already overinvests in higher education: thanks largely to liberal education policies, too many young Americans have to go to college to get a high-school education. The President's proposal would only briefly relieve anxiety over tuition, because federal aid generally causes tuition to rise. (A college that cuts tuition is throwing away millions of dollars in aid.) In addition, government funding tends to make universities less responsive to consumers. The Wall Street Journal had it right: The Clinton plan is  ``a jobs program for the political-correctness industry.''<p>

In re: Medicare's going from bad to worse. Look for some sort of ``bipartisan'' bailout, replete with price controls, Part B premium hikes, accounting gimmickry, and, if all else fails, a bogus reduction in estimated medical-cost inflation such as the Office of Management and Budget recently inserted into the 1997 budget. All this might buy us another five years. But come the next brush with insolvency, the demographic Indian Summer we've enjoyed since Medicare's inception will have turned to frost. In 2008 the first of 76 million baby-boomers start to retire. By 2040 one-quarter of the population will be 65 or older. We will confront what demographers call ``the aging of the aged,'' with the share of Americans aged 85 and older growing more than threefold, while those between 65 and 74 increase by a mere 80 per cent. By then the combined shortfall in Social Security and Medicare could reach 10 per cent of gross domestic product. A tax fix would be unthinkable: according to some estimates, a Clinton-sized tax hike would be needed every four years for the next fifty years. Long before then, however, the futility of nickel-and-dime reforms will also be obvious. Our prediction? Within 15 years Congress will change the very nature of Social Security and Medicare -- from open-ended entitlements to defined-contribution plans such as are common in the private sector. Retirees will decide where their retirement funds are invested. Baby-boomers will probably receive less money and services from Washington than today's politically well-protected elderly. But given the rewards of the marketplace, they will also have less need for them.

Perhaps you recall the Cato Parish (Shreveport) school system making the news a few months ago when the kiddies sent a 300-foot letter to Congress begging it not to ``decentralize'' the school-lunch program. Kiddies, said the kiddies, would starve by the millions if those mean-spirited Republicans had their way. The Cato school system is back in the news, locally -- the national media seem to have missed the story this time -- for having spent $6,000 on prime-rib dinners for school administrators, officials, and cafeteria workers: enough to feed 8,000 of those starving kiddies<p>

Mass-transit enthusiasts often extol the energy efficiency of buses and commuter trains, as compared with gas-guzzling cars. But according to estimates made by the Transportation Center at the University of California at Berkeley, automobiles are now, on average, more economical in the use of fuel than the mass-transit competition. Here are the numbers provided by Sharon Sarmiento in the Spring 1996 issue of Access magazine.

 BTU per
 Passenger Mile     Autos     Buses     Transit Rail
 1980               4,782     2,813        3,008
 1993               3,593     4,374        3,687

According to the Berkeley study, mass-transit authorities have been loading their vehicles with extra equipment (wheelchair lifts, larger air conditioners), thus increasing fuel consumption, at the same time that ridership has been falling. Miss Sarmiento asks: ``Should government now encourage people to use cars to save energy?''

In Renaissance Italy, a wayward duchess might be dispatched by a dagger thrust, a silken cord, a poisoned cup. In modern New York, where Lieutenant Governor Betsy McCaughey Ross is the duchess, and the GOP political establishment (her sometime patrons) the assassins, the thing takes longer. To be sure, Mrs. Ross has her faults: she is a temperamental publicity hound with no experience in government. But would any catalogue of sins merit the thousand cuts she has gotten in the last few months? A state trooper driving her to an event was told over the phone, ``Don't make it on time''; she had no troopers at all for five weeks; she was initially denied a seat in the New York delegation to the San Diego convention; the Parks and Recreation Commissioner called up a radio talk show she was on to say she was ``creating a bad atmosphere''; her press secretary quit, saying the lieutenant governor had told her to lie; a former speechwriter called her behavior ``not sane.'' ``Did any ceremonial form of law/Doom her to not-being? Did a complete jury/Deliver her conviction up i' th' court?/Where shalt thou find this judgment registered/Unless in hell?'' ``I am Duchess of Malfi still.'' Exeunt omnes.<p>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT>HE issue of <B>NATIONAL REVIEW</B> dated February 12, 1996, gave the conclusion of the magazine that the time had come to revise our laws on drug trafficking. Seven writers contributed to the symposium. There were no differences among them on the primary findings. They were 1) that the famous drug war is not working; 2) that crime and suffering have greatly increased as a result of prohibition; 3) that we have seen, and are countenancing, a creeping attrition of authentic civil liberties; and 4) that the direction in which to head is legalization, whatever modifications in kind, speed, and variety commend themselves in study and practice.
<P>
The response from the magazine's readers is, in volume, second only to the response to the issue in 1991 given over to the exploration of anti-Semitism. We have had over four hundred communications, and the only civil way to introduce fragments from these letters, as we now do, is to apologize to their authors for our failure to acknowledge them individually. (One letter is approximately eight thousand words long and is marked, ``Not for publication in whole or in part.'') Four hundred letters addressed to the President of the United States, or even to a senator or congressman, would almost certainly be acknowledged, by using form letters A, B, and C. But even a letter so spare as to have been usable to all our correspondents would have broken our clerical bank. Add to this an indisposition to craft letters so diffuse as to fail to qualify as serious answers. (H. L.Mencken's formula was always to say, ``You may be right. Sincerely, HLM.'')
<P>
Readers are about evenly divided on the recommendations of <I><B>NR</B></I>. A heavy majority were grateful that <B>NATIONAL REVIEW</B> had ventilated the subject extensively; all agree that the drug problem is acute, and no one disputes that the drug war is being lost. Those who oppose legalization are divided on what then to do, one half asking for harsher penalties, the other proposing different strategies. Inasmuch as the heavy majority of those who lean toward, or forthrightly advocate, legalization endorsed the findings and analyses of our own panel, they are given, to avoid repetition, less space in this summary. The analyses by Messrs. Buckley, Duke, McNamara, Nadelmann, Schmoke, Sweet, and Szasz are requoted here only when their recollection helps to achieve perspective in answering our critics.
<P>


1. <font size=+1>The Classic Prohibitionist View</font>
<P>
Prominence should be given to a long letter from our old friend and fellow warrior John A. Howard, founder of the Rockford Institute, now counselor to Rockford (which also publishes <I>Chronicles</I>). Commentary on his and subsequent letters is done by me -- WFB. What I say does not presume to be exactly what my colleagues would have said, but I have endeavored to avoid any disharmony with their views.
<P>
Mr. Howard says that he is surprised by the ``ignorance'' of the writers in respect of ``the large body of scientific research which contradicts their presuppositions and assertions. Bill Buckley denies any serious concern about the impact of cocaine and marijuana upon the millions of regular users because most of them continue their use 'without any observable distraction in their lives or careers.' Ethan Nadelmann asserts, 'Most people can use drugs without doing much harm to themselves or anyone else.' The other authors seem to assume the same benign character of drug use.''
<P> 
Mr. Howard goes on, ``An international colloquium on the human effects of cannabis consumption was held in Paris in 1992 under the auspices of the French National Academy of Medicine. Professor Henri Baylon, the President of the Academy, summarized the conclusions of the meeting as follows:
<P>
<blockquote>``'1. The toxicity of cannabis is well established, experimentally and clinically. The drug adversely affects the central nervous system, the lungs, and the immunity and reproductive functions.
<P>
``'2. Epidemiological studies have reported that the use of ``hard drugs'' rarely occurs among subjects who have never used cannabis.
<P>
``'3. Consequently, the participants in this colloquium rebut the distinction between ``soft'' and ``hard'' drugs.
<P>
``'4. The trivialization (``decriminalizaton'') of cannabis use, where it has occurred, has resulted in a considerable increase of its consumption and of its subsequent damaging effects.'''
</blockquote>
<P>
What I wrote (page 36): ``Professor Steven Duke of Yale Law School, in his valuable book, <I>America's Longest War: Rethinking Our Tragic Crusade against Drugs</I>, and scholarly essay, 'Drug Prohibition: An Unnatural Disaster,' reminds us that it isn't the use of illegal drugs that we have any business complaining about, it is the abuse of such drugs. It is acknowledged that tens of millions of Americans (I have seen the figure 85 million) have at one time or another consumed, or exposed themselves to, an illegal drug. But the estimate authorized by the federal agency charged with such explorations is that there are not more than 1 million regular cocaine users, defined as those who have used the drug at least once in the preceding week. There are (again, an informed estimate) 5 million Americans who regularly use marijuana; and again, an estimated 70 million who once upon a time, or even twice upon a time, inhaled marijuana. From the above we reasonably deduce that Americans who abuse a drug, here defined as Americans who become addicted to it or even habituated to it, are a very small percentage of those who have experimented with a drug, or who continue to use a drug without any observable distraction in their lives or careers.''
<br>
<br>
<p>
One wonders why Mr. Howard wastes his time (and ours) by his misreadings and irrelevancies. When the French National Academy of Medicine reports that cannabis is ``toxic'' in that it ``affects the central nervous system,'' it is telling us nothing that is not obvious. There is no other reason to use marijuana than that it affects the nervous system. And any inhalation of tar affects the lungs. If marijuana seriously affects the reproductive functions, one can only wonder at the success of the Woodstock generation in reproducing itself. To say that everyone who uses cocaine probably once used marijuana is correct and meaningless. Everyone who rapes probably once masturbated. Most excesses are progressive. To conclude that there is no distinction between soft and hard drugs is simply to ignore the discriminating capacity of our senses, to distinguish between the man who has taken a glass of beer and the man who has taken a half-dozen martinis.
<P>
And this, of course, is the key insight. Nothing the Academy says about cannabis or cocaine can't be said about alcohol, which the United States finally decriminalized after 13 ugly (and cheerless) years. It is especially curious that Mr. Howard failed to grapple with the point, given that the sentence in the NR issue immediately after the one he quoted above read: <I>``About such users</I> [i.e., occasional marijuana and indeed cocaine users] <I>one might say that they are the equivalent of those Americans who drink liquor but do not become alcoholics, or those Americans who smoke cigarettes but do not suffer a shortened lifespan as a result.''</I>
<P>
And a factual point. Mr. Howard: ``Robert Sweet does urge the acceptance of 'the recommendations of President Nixon's commission on drug law to end the criminalization of marijuana.' That would seem to support his view, except it is flatly untrue. That commission recommended that marijuana remain contraband, subject to confiscation by law-enforcement officials.''
<P>
The National Commission on Marijuana and Drug Abuse (The ``Nixon Marijuana Commission'') found in 1972 that ``there is little proven danger of physical or psychological harm from the experimental or intermittent use'' of marijuana. On the question of law enforcement, the panel recommended a ``decriminalization'' of possession of marijuana for personal use on both the state and the federal levels. Specifically, it recommended that:
<P><blockquote>
`` -- Federal and state laws be changed to no longer make it a crime to possess marijuana for private use.
<P>
`` -- The distribution in private of small amounts of marijuana for no remuneration or for insignificant amounts should no longer be an offense.
<P>
`` -- State laws should make the public use of marijuana a criminal offense punishable by a $100 fine. Under federal law, marijuana smoked in public would merely be subject to seizure.''</blockquote><P>

Most of the letters received fall into one or another of the categories enumerated below.
<p>
2. <font size=+1>The Demands of the Natural Law</font>
<p>
<blockquote><I>``. . . in most arenas (the suicide business, abortion, others) you make reference to natural law, but in the isolated area of drug legalization you seem to discount the possibility of any higher guidance and use expediency as the rationale.''<p>
  -- Dr. T. P. Collins, Portsmouth, Virginia</I></blockquote>
<P>

No such thing was intended. But laws do not for the most part instruct us whether to engage in particular activities. Of the seven deadly sins (gluttony, avarice, sloth, pride, lust, envy, wrath) only two are also proscribed by statute law, and even they, only marginally. Jimmy Carter confessed to lust in his heart, but the policeman materializes only when lust activates aggression. Wrath is okay (in fact it is even encouraged, in times of war) except when it causes you to kill or maim innocents.
<P>
<br>
<hr width=50%>
<br>
3. <font size=+1>Personal Responsibility</font>
<P>
Much indignation is expressed over the tacit position of many anti-prohibitionists that the addicted class is free to become a public burden.
<p>
<blockquote><I>``Several years ago, our Congress chose to follow the leadership of American liberals by deciding that taking illegal drugs was a 'disease.' In reality, the use of drugs describes a behavior. . . . The result? The illegal drug-takers are 'rehabilitated' to the point where they no longer need to work to make their way in life; they simply hand the tab to the taxpayer.''<P>
  -- Jack W. Pace, Lincoln, Rhode Island</I></blockquote>
<P>

But surely it is not plausible that anyone well and persuasively instructed in the tortures of addiction would think to take up drugs merely as a means of effecting a personal welfare program? What several symposium contributors stressed was different, namely that the dollar spent on instruction and therapy effects a higher return than the dollar spent on detection, trial, and imprisonment.
<P>
<hr width=50%>
<br>
4. <font size=+1>Can Anyone Function With Drugs?</font>
<P>
Some viewers of the <I>Firing Line</I> programs aired in February featuring contributors to the <B><I>NR</I></B> drug symposium were astonished to hear (from Mr. Nadelmann and Dr. Szasz) that indeed some drug users can and do lead apparently normal lives.
<P>
<blockquote><I>``On Saturday morning, you sat there and countenanced the proposition that heroin was less dangerous than alcohol . . . Especially appalling was the suggestion that the addict could 'function' if he or she were freed from the problem of obtaining enough money to fund an illegal habit. The idea that an addict can function is almost as insane as the addict's substance abuse is insane. How do you define 'function'? Does it mean to lead a responsible, productive life? Does it mean simply to be able to feed and dress oneself? Does it mean to live and not be a threat to other people? How much self-reliance and safety do you include in your definition?''<P>  -- Louise H. Perret, Rye, New York</I></blockquote><P>

It is established that some people can ``function'' even after ingesting cocaine. Dr. Szasz has written on the matter in several of his books. He is arguing two positions. The first is that the ``abuse'' of drugs is a variable. Even as we know those who can tolerate five drinks, and those who can't tolerate one, it is evidently so with cocaine. This is hardly to recommend the use of it, since for the overwhelming majority it is immobilizing. Dr. Szasz makes the point that it is clinically incorrect to assume that everyone is equally affected. His other point is that to impose legal sanctions against someone merely because it is established that he has used the drug is an encroachment on human rights.
<P>
<br>
<hr width=50%>
<br>

5. <font size=+1>Is Drug Legalization Analogous To Choice in Abortion?</font>
<P>
<blockquote><I>``I'm surprised no one has thought of the parallel between the legalization of drugs and the legalization of abortion. The same arguments . . . could easily be used to legalize drugs. Right to privacy, freedom to do what one wishes with one's body, even the threat that if abortion were illegal women would have to resort to the back-alley butcher. Just change this last one to read back-alley pusher and the two are identical.''<P>
  -- Frank F. Bellotti, Seattle, Washington</I></blockquote>
<p>

The parallel is of limited use, surely, inasmuch as opposition to abortion springs from the belief that there is an aggrieved party, with human rights.
<P>
<br>
<hr width=50%>
<br>

6. <font size=+1>Would Legalization Bring More Government?</font>
<P>
<blockquote><I>``Another almost certain consequence [of decriminalization] would be the creation of a Federal Drug Control bureaucracy that would make the current Drug War machine seem trivial. . . . Another worry concerning the legalization of drugs is its probable effect on the workplace. Today, we employers can fire drugged-up employees. But, with legalization, I can imagine that employers will be forced to continue the employment of worthless workers under the Americans with Disabilities Act.''<P>
  -- John F. Brinson, Allentown, Pennsylvania</I></blockquote><P>

Surely implausible? There was less government, in respect of alcohol, affecting individual lives after Prohibition than during it. Besides, it must by no means be taken for granted that all the contributors to <I><B>NR</B></I>'s symposium favor diminished social and economic sanctions, were legalization to come. It is not inconsistent to favor legalization alongside an intensification of these other sanctions.
<P>
The columnist Nicholas von Hoffman lists what society is in a position to do to make its point. The taking of drugs ought to be legislated as a civil offense. What then might a drug consumer expect? To begin with, everyone would have to submit to periodic blood testing.
<P>
``Anyone testing positive for drug use would be subject to the revocation of a huge army of privileges, ranging from temporary to permanent loss of driver's license, the revocation of one's license to practice law, operate a barber shop, work as an electrician, practice medicine or be a plumber, rent property, buy and sell securities. Civil penalties for drug use could also include cancellation of eligibility for every kind of government loan insurance, loss of eligibility for welfare, student grants in aid, subsidies, and government payments of any kind, large or small. Persons found selling drugs would be subject to cancellation of medical insurance, and Social Security, up to and including refused admission to hospitals or hospices. No criminal penalties, no long trials, no F. Lee Blundermouths, or Whirling Dershowitzes. Civil society, through quick, essentially unappealable administrative tribunals, would turn its back on such people for a greater or lesser period of time.''
<P>
The promulgation of the Hoffman Protocols would require some fiddling with the Constitution. But can it be said that Mr. Hoffman is soft on drugs, though he advocates legalization?
<P>
<br>
<hr width=50%>
<br>

7. <font size=+1>The Federalist Implications</font>
<P>
<blockquote><I>``We tend to speak of the 'legalization' of drugs, when we really are referring to the repeal of national drug legislation. . . . Why should the conservative coalition split itself apart in arguments over whether 'government' ought [to] act aggressively against drug production and consumption, or adopt a libertarian unconcern and let the market proceed to do its work? The issue cuts too deeply. Where are we likely to find a better opportunity to educate the American people about federalism? The remanding of drug policy to the states would dramatically illustrate the futility and destructiveness of much meddlesome federal administration.''<P>
  -- Scott Rutledge, Richardson, Texas</I></blockquote><P>

State-bounded experiments lifting criminal sanctions against marijuana use have been attempted in a dozen states. But of course, drugs being light and unbulky, it would require an extraordinary mobilization of state constabulary to prevent border crossings. But yes, it would be prudent to repeal the federal law against marijuana use, leaving it to the states to define laws of their own. The distinguished neuroscientist Professor Michael Gazzaniga, writing in <B><I>NR</B></I> (February 5, 1990), advocated a federal drugstore in which drugs were clearly -- even dramatically -- labeled, detailing toxicity and possible/probable side effects. Such drugs would be available at a cost low enough to eliminate a black market.
<P>
<br>
<hr width=50%>
<br>

8. <font size=+1>How to Measure Social Unacceptability?</font>
<P>
Several correspondents see a difficulty in any proposition to the effect that general disobedience of a law, as with drug consumption in America, should lead to the law's abrogation.
<p>
<blockquote><I>``. . . The Buckley corollary seems to be that if the enforcement of a criminal law measured by an unspecified ratio of persons convicted of the crime to those engaged in the conduct criminalized is too low, then the conduct should be legalized. I would like to have your views on whether, for example, you believe laws making homicide criminal should be repealed if it became apparent that most homicides were unsolved.''<P>
  -- Walter S. Lewis, Princeville, Hawaii</I></blockquote><P>

The point is argumentatively interesting, but collapses under scrutiny. Many sometime laws withered away with the separation of church and state, and sluggish observance. Attendance at Sunday services was theoretically compulsory in some localities even after the Constitution was ratified. Such laws gradually disappeared, as also, almost two centuries later, laws against commerce on the Lord's Day. What looms is greater emphasis on the distinction between victimless crimes and other crimes. Laws against sodomy are de facto relics of another age, although they are still on the books in some states. Laws against suicide are formalistic, inasmuch as prosecution is, in the nature of the case, impossible.
<P>
To be sure, the term ``victimless'' is used glibly. Isn't a prostitute, even if she engages in her profession voluntarily, in some real sense a victim? The drug consumer can, by his habit, victimize his family, but then so can the wage earner who dissipates his salary at the race track. It is preposterous to argue that the drug consumer does no damage, but my colleagues in the symposium are agreed that the sum of human damage done by the drug laws is greater than would be done without them, and that the primary -- and sometimes only -- victim in the latter case would be the drug user. The murderer's victim is someone whose rights are theoretically guaranteed by the Constitution; and the promiscuity of homicide is, up to a point, evidence of the delinquency of law enforcers. There is no evidence, the contributors to the drug symposium are agreed, that increasing the severity of prison sentences, or the density of patrolmen on our frontiers, would so successfully interdict drug traffic as to make the war on drugs victorious.
<P>
<br>
<hr width=50%>
<br>
9. <font size=+1>Isn't It a Matter of Law Enforcement?</font>
<p>
On this point -- law enforcement -- many correspondents dwelled. Blame for the ineffectiveness of the drug laws is laid on the shoulders of politicians, judges, police officers, lawyers, jurors, educators, parents, and doctors.
<P>
<blockquote><I>``I do not believe that the drug war has been lost; it has not yet been fought. What we have had up to this point have been ploys designed by politicians to appease as many of the various segments of the voting public as possible. A law that is not vigorously enforced is no deterrent. It is not the existence of a law that is the deterrent, it is the enforcement of the law. . . .''<P>
  -- Howard R. Jeter, North Huntingdon, Pennsylvania</I></blockquote><P>

Arriving at a different conclusion, in our symposium, were Joseph McNamara, who has served as police chief in two major U.S. cities; Judge Robert Sweet of New York, who, called upon to implement the Rockefeller drug laws, has seen the tumbrils pass by, en route to twenty years' imprisonment; and Mayor Kurt Schmoke of Baltimore, who has presided for nine years over the government of a drug-torn city. Federal money appropriated to prosecute drug traffic and drug use rose by 1,000 per cent between Nixon and Clinton. We have seen oscillations in drug use, especially a sharp diminution in cocaine consumption, but these have little bearing on the intensity of the drug war. It is for that reason that the panelists join in concluding that, this side of draconian punishment (flogging?) (hanging?) (public?), the drug war cannot claim victory.<P>
<br>
<hr width=50%>
<br>
10. <font size=+1>Where Do You Draw the Line?</font>
<blockquote><I>``. . . How do you make the decision which is which? You did not distinguish among drugs. Are there no drugs that should be banned, and if some should be, how is the line drawn?''
 <P> -- Francis S. Webster III, Austin, Texas</I></blockquote><P><br>

The text on the cover of the drug issue read, 
<p>
<blockquote>THE WAR ON DRUGS IS LOST
 <I><P><li>-- Kill It
 <P><li>-- Go for Legalization
<P><li>-- Free up Police, Courts
 <P><li>-- Reduce Crime</I></blockquote>
<P>

The panelists were not asked to draw the line. But in order to accomplish the stated objectives (free up police, courts; reduce crime), the profit from the merchandising of drugs would need to be all but abolished. This means, clearly, legal access to the most popular drug (marijuana) and the runner-up (cocaine). For most users, soft drugs are preferred over the most toxic, even as beer and wine are preferred over 200-proof alcohol. Crack cocaine is of course readily deduced as a (now) cheap byproduct of cocaine.
<P>
There is some evidence that crack cocaine can induce violent conduct. How, then, to handle the hypothetical buyer who enters a federal drugstore and asks for crack cocaine? Perhaps as was for so many years required in New Zealand of customers for beer -- that they consume it on the premises. . . . But on such specifics, the panelists were not questioned. Dr. Szasz is, on the subject, a libertarian absolute. My sense of it is that most of the others would move step by step provided the profit in drugs were hugely reduced. A beginning might be the legalization of marijuana.
<P>
<br>
<hr width=50%>
<br>
11. <font size=+1>Alcohol and Drugs</font>
<P>
<blockquote><I>``. . . you make the ludicrous mistake of comparing alcohol with drugs. With alcohol, you may have a hangover, but you will never experience a 'snapback' to full and complete intoxication. Take a visit to a drug hospital. You will see people wandering around like mind-numbed robots, oblivious to the world around them.''<P>
  -- Oliver A. Rockwog, La Puente, California</I></blockquote><p>

To compare drugs and alcohol is not to equate them. An analogy, by definition, marks similarities on the understanding that there are also dissimilarities. Marijuana, cocaine, and whisky are all psychotropic drugs. Of the three, only marijuana can't kill -- there is no record of death from overdose. Alcohol is responsible for an estimated 100,000 premature deaths every year. And alcohol is the most common wrecker of personal and professional lives, and by far the most common inducement to crime and mayhem. The damage done by drugs to the human body similarly varies. There are the cocaine-induced zombies, some of whom will never recover, and the alcoholics who suffer from more than a hangover because when they wake they turn again to the bottle.<P>
The primary distinction is that alcohol is a happy part of Western culture, and there is the presumptive case against introducing another species of psychotropic drug into that culture. But the panelists, in the issue under discussion, weren't arguing in favor of a supplementary drug. We were addressing the question: What do we do under present circumstances? -- having failed to stop drug traffic, and become progressively accustomed to privations caused by the endless war against drugs?
<P>
<br>
<hr width=50%>
<br>
12. <font size=+1>Hard-Drug Users Are Criminals To Begin With</font>
<blockquote><I>``As a 22-year prosecutor in a small rural area, I believe I have a better view of the everyday criminal than does a big-city prosecutor. . . . Marijuana is a fairly harmless substance that could be legalized without any real effect on the crime problem in general. Marijuana is a substance whose effects on the lives of those who take it are similar to alcohol, and people who use it have the ability to be normally functioning members of society. . . .<P>
``On the level of everyday street crime, however, the drug laws are a major advantage to law enforcement. Most of the '50 per cent' of criminals in prison for drug offenses are not there because they are major dealers or dealers at all. They are there because they have a long history of criminality prior to being caught with drugs. Possession of drugs is both easy to prove and very inexpensive to prosecute. But when you send these people to prison, you prevent innumerable thefts and acts of violence. Only very rarely is violence by drug addicts directly related to drugs themselves.''<P>
  -- Fred Schroeder, Marysville, California</I></blockquote><P>

The point plays on a theme widely distracting. Some students of the drug question believe that drug traffic is, as here suggested, merely a convenient vehicle for criminal energies that will find another outlet should the profit in drugs come to an end. What percentage of the drug-related prison population falls into this category (Category #1) is of course unknown. But it is known that many non-criminally-inclined Americans have experimented with drugs (we have used the figure 70 million). Some of these, caught in the act, are in jail (Category #2). And then there are those who become addicted and, in order to satisfy their craving, engage in criminal activity they'd never have engaged in but for their addiction and the high price of drugs. They are in jail either because they were detected in theft, or because they were caught consuming or trafficking in drugs (Category #3). The argument that in order to expedite the imprisonment of Category #1 we should not object to the imprisonment of Categories #2 and #3 is not persuasive.<P><br>
<hr width=50%>
<br>

13. <font size=+1>'I Saw What Happened . . .'</font>
<P>
<blockquote><I>``I saw what happened to promising young men and women in the late Sixties and Seventies when drugs were popularized. I had to raise four children under peer pressure . . . I saw the 'burnouts' and the dropouts. It would tear you to pieces. I saw friends of my sons go off to the University of Michigan clean and come back hopelessly on drugs. I saw families spending themselves into bankruptcy trying to dry them out.''<P>
  -- Lawrence E. Flora, Stuart, Florida</I></blockquote><P>

Who ``popularized'' drugs? An indulgent lifestyle. You write of the burnouts you have seen. How do you propose to diminish their number? They are there notwithstanding our war on drugs. What do you propose? Longer prison terms?
<P><br>
<hr width=50%>
<br>
14. <font size=+1>It's Simple: It's Wrong</font>
<P>
<blockquote><I>``I started using marijuana at age 14, speed at 15, mescaline and LSD at 16, THC at 17, cocaine at 18, and freebasing cocaine at 22. I know from first-hand experience what the use of illegal drugs can do. . . . I started doing drugs at age 14 and continued until I reached the age of 27, when I overdosed on cocaine. I believe that I am a better expert than any pundit who has ever read a paper, done a test, or contributed to any article. I know why drugs should never be legalized: to use drugs is wrong. Simple, isn't it? But that is where we must all begin to answer the question involved here.
<P>
``Drug use is wrong; to consciously ingest any substance for the purpose of changing or altering your mood is wrong. The effects of long-term drug use are clearly proven; to be involved in drug use while young affects the mind while growing up; it shapes the emotions of the pubescent who is going through the normal growing pains that all must go through, yet doesn't allow the teenager to view life through a normal viewpoint. I know. I have had to learn how to deal with people all over again since coming clean. It cannot be repeated enough:the use of drugs for the purpose of enjoyment is wrong.
<P>
``I know. I have done drugs in Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Vermont, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, California, Washington, Vancouver, B.C., Hawaii, Guam, Philippines, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Mombasa Kenya, and Singapore. I have done drugs at Parris Island during boot camp; Cherry Point, North Carolina; Kaneohe Bay, Hawaii; 29 Palms, California; on board the USS</I> LaMoore County, <I>USS</I> Okinawa, and <I>USS</I> Belleau Wood. <I>It's wrong.''<P>  -- Unsigned</I></blockquote><p>

We agree, it's wrong. And your experiences certainly document that the war against drugs has failed. . . . You were wise to leave Singapore. If caught, you would not have completed your itinerary. But we don't want to bring Singapore to America.
<P><br>
<hr width=50%>
<br>
15. <font size=+1>The View from Abroad</font>
<P>
<blockquote><I>``As a career Foreign Service Officer, I have served in drug-producing countries and seen the disastrous effects our policy has on those nations and how it benefits our enemies. We have created new sources of funds for politicos and cops already disposed to corruption. We risk the lives of brave American agents in a fight in which our 'allies' have no interest and see, rightly, as our problem, not theirs. We have huge bureaucracies in the State Department, Pentagon, CIA, DEA, FBI, AID, and Justice and legions of Beltway bandits thriving on the 'war' and its programs, conferences, etc. But the drugs still come; prices still drop; availability still rises -- and the body count in our streets doesn't stop. The war is a massive fraud with incalculable negative effects at home and abroad.''<P>
  -- Name Withheld by Request</I></blockquote>
<p>
<br>
<hr width=50%>
<br>
16. <font size=+1>Devolution</font>
<P>
<blockquote><I>``The most embarrassing aspect of the articles was that Steven 'I-am-not-a-conservative' Duke was the only person to recognize what we should do: devolve the matter to the states. Let Utah maintain its prohibition, let the People's Republic of New York legalize . . . and let NR stop searching for a national solution.''<P>
  -- Steven C. Russell, Bountiful, Utah</I></blockquote>
<P>
<br>
<hr width=50%>
<br>
17. <font size=+1>If It Isn't Illegal . . .</font>
<blockquote><I>``Tell me something, Mr. Buckley, if you can't educate someone on the dangers of drug use when it is illegal, how are you going to do so after it is legalized? I have two sons who are alcoholics. One of my uncles and my older brother both drank themselves to death. I shudder to think of the additional tragedies we would have had to deal with if drugs were legal. Our laws against drug use are important, Mr. Buckley. May God help you to see that and to engage the enemies of right behavior.
``What are my credentials? I am a janitor who has more sense than a fistful of intellectuals that write articles for magazines.''<P>
  -- Jerry G. Allen, St. Louis, Missouri</I></blockquote><P>

Were the people who, 63 years ago, ended Prohibition responsible for the tragedies experienced by your family? The argument would appear to be saying exactly that.<P>


We are grateful to our readers, as ever; and regret we can't, for obvious reasons, publish all that you wrote. The argument goes on. You have contributed to the public understanding, and to my own.<P><center>

<p>
<hr> 
<P>
Dear Rusty,
<P>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<P>

I'm enclosing your FBI file, which I promise I haven't so much as peeked at. A couple of the guys in Leon Panetta's office brought it by -- they're doing some late spring cleaning over there -- and they thought I'd better forward it to you.
<p>
So I guess it's good news, bad news. The good news is that you're cleared at ``all-access'' level, which means that if you and I are planning some day to meet for lunch in the White House Mess, and I'm not in my office, well, you can walk all over the building looking for me and no Marine is going to shoot you. The bad news is that your tax returns were forwarded to the IRS and it's not clear whether you've adequately reported foreign cash income. Apparently, the IRS will be in touch.
<p> 
What can I say? I'm sorry. The stack of files in the ``Al's Friends'' box inadvertently got mixed up with the ones in the ``Known Enemies'' box, and some low-level Army clerk ordered full FBI work-ups on all the names -- from Jim Baker and Tony Blankley right on down to you, Rusty -- and when the files came back, some of them inadvertently got put in the file box marked ``Political Ammo,'' which sat untouched until this spring, when the campaign team started poking around.
<p>
At which point, the whole thing becomes kind of funny, when you look at it the right way. See, all we wanted was the files on the Travel Office personnel. But, apparently, they were using an old list or something, and the whole kit and caboodle came over from the DOJ, and, well, we've been chuckling over this snafu for days, let me tell you.
<p>
The point is, the Travel Office was being run in a slapdash and haphazard way, but now it's run by us, so things are much better. Naturally, the press is having a field day with this. They don't see the humor in it, I guess. And of course, so much of the outcry is politically motivated.
<p>
It was a simple, honest mistake. We requested the FBI files, we received them, we mislaid them. You know, if I had a nickel for every important thing we've mislaid in this Administration . . . well, you know.
<p>
The problem is, this kind of silly event really plays into the Republicans' hands.
<p>
They're trying to run on the ``character'' issue, again, Rusty. I keep telling Bill not to worry, that I've got character enough for both of us, but the truth is, it might work.
<p>
I was talking to Tipper about this over breakfast.
<p> 
``Tipper,'' I said, ``I'm concerned that the Nixonesque overtones of the FBI file debacle -- ''
<p>
``Shhhhhh,'' she said, peering over a pile of pages. ``I'm trying to read.''
<p>
I was quiet for a moment. Then Tipper looked up.
<p>
 ``Guess,'' she said, ``how many unpaid parking tickets Liddy Dole had in 1985.'' 
<p>
``I'm sorry?''
<p>
``Go on. Guess.''
<p>
``Six?'' I said.
<p>
``Try eleven. That's pretty negligent, don't you think?''
<p>
``Tipper,'' I asked firmly, ``what are you reading?''
<p>
``Let's call it opposition research,'' she answered. ``I just wish that Christie Todd Whitman had done a stint for Reagan or Bush,'' she added.
<p>
``Tipper, I'm trying to share with you how I feel about the character issue. And right now, I feel very vulnerable.''
<p>
``Well, you should.''
<p>
``Tip?''
<p>
``Look, Al,'' she said, ``I was the one who said that '96 was the year you should be on the top of the ticket. I was the one who wanted to invite Susan Thomases over for a drink, dust her wine glass when she left, and send the prints to Ken Starr to compare with the ones he lifted from the Rose Law Firm billing records. I was the one who wanted to wear a wire during one of Hillary's 'stonewall-'em' tirades. Each time you said no.'' 
<p>
``You're darn right I did.''
<p>
But Tipper was on a roll. ``So now you come to me,'' she said, ``worrying about the character issue. Well, honey, the only way to combat the character issue is with a character issue of our own.''
<p>
``What does that mean?'' I asked.
<p>
``It means I have a lot of reading to do before these files are discovered by a White House Fellow cleaning out the dust bunnies in the Lincoln Bedroom the day after tomorrow.''
<p>
``What?''
<p>
``Al, don't worry about it. You're going to be late for your 'Corporate Responsibility Summit.'''

<H2>Higgonbotham-D'Amato-Hillary
</H2></CENTER>

<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, MAY 28
<P>


At graduation ceremonies at Wesleyan, retired Circuit Court Justice Leon Higginbotham closed by making two requests of the students -- that they should see always, and hear, the pleas of invisible people. He closed, ``I trust that you will never sign on to any contract with America that sanctions or promotes exclusion rather than inclusion of the weak, the poor, women, minorities, and persons of color.''
<p>
A week earlier, Senator Al D'Amato of New York anticipated the injunction of Mr. Higginbotham when (on the Don Imus program) he attacked Newt Gingrich and his policies. ``I think that we do a great disservice to ourselves if we think that people want a Republican Party that is perceived as exclusionary.''
<p>
How do non-invisible people evaluate this kind of thing? They begin by making preliminary distinctions. Judge Higginbotham is an all-time, never-say-die liberal. He has spoken mournfully and eloquently of a childhood and youth wrestling with segregation and prejudice. He distinguished himself at the Yale Law School, was appointed judge by President Kennedy, and seems to be forever committed to any public policies that he identifies as in the interest of black Americans. He actively criticized the judicial record of Justice Clarence Thomas, has appeared jointly with Anita Hill, and has testified in favor of continuing programs of affirmative action.
<p> 
So what does one conclude about his advice to graduating seniors at Wesleyan? That Judge Higginbotham really believes all that business about Republican disdain for the invisible man.
<p> 
Now Al D'Amato is something else, because he is an instructed conservative, who was launched in the Senate by the Conservative Party of New York. What he means to say, when breaking with Newt Gingrich, is that his sense of the political situation is that Gingrich and his programs are unpopular, and, under the circumstances, Al D'Amato retreats from positions he and his party have been associated with for years -- balanced budget, tax reduction, line-item veto, term limits, regulatory reform, and the rest of it.
<p> 
Politicians are forever adjusting their positions to the direction of the wind, so why did Senator D'Amato make such a splash? Because the general view of Senator D'Amato is that, unlike Judge Higginbotham, his views are not fixed. Congressman Gingrich commented, ``I don't know why he is wandering around saying these things.'' That isn't true. Gingrich knows. 
<p>
And a third item over the weekend: we are made privy that the First Lady is thinking of adopting a child. Now even after making the greatest effort to understand her motivations, we must reluctantly pass over as primary an explosive appetite for more maternal experience. Mrs. Clinton chose, after the birth of her only child, not to have a second child; that, or else there were medical reasons for this; but no reason whatever to have kept her from adopting a child at any time during the past 16 years. There are good reasons for First Ladies to send their children home for the length of their husbands' tenure, not many for bringing more babies into the White House. Moreover, Mrs. Clinton is and has been for years one of the liveliest girls in town, distinguishing herself at law school and as a practicing lawyer and as wife of a governor and President, consumed by political life. So what are we to make of her sally?
<p>
That her advisors thought it useful, bringing attention as it does to the hearth-like nature of Bill and Hillary's real life, and incidentally blunting the nails of the nymphs who scratch away at her husband.
<p> 
Why do we fall for such things? What drives the wind that drives D'Amato? Why does Higginbotham really believe (he most certainly does believe it) that the GOP is the enemy of the invisible American?
<p>
Because of the GOP assault on school lunches. That's why! Higginbotham would cite that. Al D'Amato's constituents would cite that. Reduced school lunches are the stigmata of the Invisible American, broken by the wheel of Gingrich.
<p>
What exactly did Mr. Gingrich's Congress propose? The Democrats had scheduled a 5.2 per cent increase in school-lunch money.
<p>
The exclusionary Republicans proposed a 4 per cent increase.
<p> 
It is over such as this that Higginbotham weeps, D'Amato defects, and the Clinton family prospectively grows.

17-JUNE-1996

<LI>A new diet is sweeping America. You eat dessert only on days when President Clinton takes a position different from Bob Dole's.

``Nauseating and appalling,'' ``political cowardice,'' ``completely cynical'' -- so gay spokesmen responded to President Clinton's announcement that he would sign the Defense of Marriage Act, if it should pass Congress. The move was an election-year triumph of short-term calculations over long-term goals. The Republican bill is in part a pre-emptive response to the gay lobby's Hawaiian gambit, allowing states to reject gay-marriage contracts entered into in other states. Clinton has long said he opposes same-sex marriage, and his gay supporters have agreed to disagree with him on the matter. But the bill also defines marriage, for the purposes of the Federal Government, as the union of one man and one woman, and thus denies federal tax, welfare, pension, health, immigration, and survivor's benefits to same-sex couples. Before the announcement, Marsha Scott, the President's liaison to gays, had been exploring ways of extending such benefits, without the rubric of marriage. Clinton's abandonment of her efforts is what provoked gay wrath. Gays should cheer up. If Clinton wins, helped by such fudges, he can resume the effort (perhaps with the help of a new bill) to give them everything but the name.

It is increasingly unlikely that Republicans will propose to eliminate race and gender preferences despite overwhelming public support for ending the group spoils system. GOP House leaders believe it's impossible to move the Dole - Canady bill over the objections of Gary Franks (R., Conn.), who is 50 per cent of the House black Republican caucus. Franks is satisfied with the Clinton Administration's review of federal affirmative action, endorsing its ``Mend it, don't end it'' line. The media can be counted on to put Republicans on the defensive by highlighting Franks's opposition. The counterweight to Franks would be enlisting Jack Kemp (who has yet to endorse the bill) and J. C. Watts (R., Okla.), who supports the bill's substance but questions its timing, to make the principled case on its behalf. Meanwhile, the Dole campaign is in full panic over the gender gap, and its pollsters are counseling their candidate to downplay his support for the California Civil Rights Initiative, which opponents plan to fight over its alleged devastating effects on women. The CCRI battle is both winnable and unavoidable, and its courageous supporters like Ward Connerly deserve the enthusiastic assistance of fellow Republicans. As Republicans complain about Clinton stealing their issues, it is disheartening to watch them throwing away one of their strongest.<p>

Call them slow learners, but the Clintonistas may finally have found the legislative strategy they had overlooked for three years: forging a majority alliance of Democrats and liberal Republicans. Consider the minimum wage. In mid May the House Republican leadership had chosen a course that seemed well suited to put the debate firmly on GOP terms. An exemption for small businesses -- aping Democratic language from 1989 -- would be included in the minimum-wage bill, making it impossible for the President to sign it and turning the debate into a contest between small business and Big Labor. Just one problem: fellow Republicans wouldn't go along. A stunning 43 of them defected on the small-business exemption. House Majority Leader Dick Armey commented privately before the vote that no more than ten Republicans from union districts had reason to defect; the rest would just be kowtowing to country-club friends. Meanwhile, the Senate is operating in a similar vein. Instead of shifting money from other areas to labor, health, and education -- which would require making some tough choices -- Senate Republicans, at the behest of ``budget hawk'' Pete Domenici (R., N.M.), simply added another $5 billion in discretionary spending to the budget (the vote was lopsided, 75 to 25). The Senate also looks to be cooking up a welfare/Medicaid bill so weak that it will get past liberal roadblock John Chafee (R., R.I.) and hence get a presidential signature. At this rate, the President will manage in the next few months to build a solid record of accomplishment, thanks to his most effective friends on the other side of the aisle.<p>

In Forbes magazine, Steve Hanke draws attention to a recent study by Peter Boone of the London School of Economics on the relationship between economic aid received by 97 countries and their economic growth. He found there wasn't any. The only discernible effect of the aid was to boost the size of recipient governments. Being channeled through governments, foreign aid generated more patronage powers at the expense of the productive sector. Despite the London School of Economics' reputation as a sheltered workshop for the Left, Boone is not alone: LSE has, in the person of the illustrious economist Peter Bauer, an honorable history of questioning the conventional wisdom on foreign aid. N.B.: Isn't it time that his pioneering work was rewarded with a Nobel Prize?<p>

The campaign of Libertarian Harry Browne has announced that its candidate leads in Internet polls. The CNN/Time Virtual Election poll shows Browne at 23 per cent, followed by Dole (19 per cent), Clinton (18), Buchanan (17), John Hagelin (9), and Perot (5). That's fine. But if the Clinton and Hagelin forces unite, who will save the Republic?

When President Clinton and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl were supping on ribs, meatloaf, steak, and barbecued chicken in Milwaukee, was there a metaphor there? As James K. Glassman reminds us in the Washington Post, Germany, with its generous retirement system, worker-training programs, and nationalized health care, was a model for Bill Clinton in 1992. Yet now Germany's manufacturing staggers under the burden of labor costs 50 per cent higher than ours. No wonder unemployment in Germany is 10.4 per cent (about twice ours), while its GDP is expected to grow this year by less than 1 per cent. Now Kohl is desperately trying to get Germany's welfare state and public spending under control; a wave of strikes hit the public sector after he declared a two-year wage freeze. President Clinton, meanwhile -- with such initiatives as pushing up the minimum wage -- continues to blunder toward the Eurosclerosis that Chancellor Kohl is struggling to escape.

Occasional NR contributor David Frum roiled Canadian politics last week by posting the banns for a marriage between Canada's two almost-conservative parties, Reform and the Progressive Conservatives. He brought together some sixty of their parliamentary and grass-roots members at a Winds of Change conference in Calgary that the media immediately dubbed a Unite-the-Right cabal. The media, for once, had a point. Canada's last election -- when the Liberals won a substantial victory over a Right divided between the imploding Tory government and the rising Reform Party -- illustrated that in a first-past-the-post electoral system, if the Right is split, the Left triumphs. So there was good reason for an engagement; but how did the happy couple take to each other? They had little difficulty in agreeing on a common economic and social program (lower and flatter taxation, a balanced budget, etc.) that most American conservatives could happily endorse. But they had to gloss over differences on certain key issues, notably abortion and Quebec. And there is a suspicion that the party leaders are either skeptical of an alliance (Reform's Preston Manning) or downright hostile to one (Jean Charest of the Tories). A united Right will emerge in any event: either because conservative voters switch gradually to one of the parties, or because the party leaders make it to the altar. But Pastor Frum's shotgun wedding would take less time.<p>

H. Douglas Anderson, a Seattle-area psychologist, has been fined $1,500 by a state examining board, put on one year's probation, and ordered to take a series of ethics courses for a ``breach of ethics'' that ``fell below professional standards.'' The crime? A patient had asked what he thought about her impending abortion. He told her that it would be wrong.

Christina Jeffrey, the former House Historian ousted after being falsely accused of having Nazi sympathies, has sued Reps. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.) and Barney Frank (D., Mass.), who first made the charges, and Speaker Newt Gingrich, who failed to defend her, for slander and defamation of character. Gingrich sinned by omission and subsequently acknowledged the delinquency. But his Right Honorable colleagues have never apologized for defaming Professor Jeffrey before the world (in a more honorable age they would have been challenged to duels). Initially Mrs. Jeffrey sought nothing more than compensation for her out-of-pocket expenses and the correction of the public record. Mr. Gingrich having refused the first, she has been forced to take legal recourse. Her determination to set the record straight might serve us all eventually. Former Labor Secretary Ray Donovan famously asked, after a similar trip through the mill, where he could go to get his reputation back. Christina Jeffrey's lawsuit may caution those who would casually destroy others' reputations to be mindful of their own.

<p>
<I>Five years after the break-up of Soviet Communism,
Russia is in a state of anarchy, with its reforms in shambles
and its Communists once again willing to proclaim themselves.</I>
<p>
<H3>by DAVID SATTER</H3>

Mr. Satter, a senior fellow at the Jamestown Foundation and a visiting scholar at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies, is the author of Age of Delirium: The Decline and Fall of the Soviet Union, just out from Knopf.
<BR>
<HR  width=50%>
</CENTER>
<P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT>HE afternoon light filtered through the linden and chestnut trees in the city park, and martial music played over loudspeakers attached to the branches as a large crowd waited in the humid heat for the beginning of a speech by Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist candidate for president.
<P>
After a day of campaigning in other parts of the pro-Communist Bryansk region 250 miles southwest of Moscow, near the border with Ukraine, Zyuganov had come to Klintsy, a dilapidated city of 70,000 full of weathered wooden houses and rusting five-story housing projects.
<P>
The mood of the crowd was both nervous and expectant. Virtually all the city's factories had been closed down and many people had gone for seven or eight months without pay. Klintsy was also in the heart of the Chernobyl radiation zone, and there had been no government payments for radiation exposure since February.
<P>
I asked a woman in a print dress if she was supporting Zyuganov.
<P>
``We will all vote for Zyuganov,'' she said, ``because we want someone to give us our lives back. There are only two factories in the city that are operating. All the others are dead. We want to be able to work. Only the businessmen are wealthy. Everyone else is unemployed and hungry.''
<P>
Others crowded around. ``The children in school have nothing to eat,'' said a middle-aged woman. ``In the fourth lesson in literature, my daughter fell into a coma. They said it was a sign of epilepsy but she is not the only one. The children are undernourished.''
<P>
``The pensioners have nothing to live on,'' said another woman. ``I worked for 41 years on the Boyevik collective farm. It's painful to work so hard and be left with nothing.''
<P>
``The pensioners at least get something,'' replied a man in a worker's cap. ``What about the workers? It's been seven months without pay.''
<P>
``Everyone's nerves are on edge,'' said another woman, ``We don't see any future.''
<P>
<P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>W</FONT>ITH only two weeks to go until the presidential elections, the scene in Klintsy is typical of much of Russia. The country is seething with discontent, and there is widespread fear of violence.
<P>
At the end of May, most public-opinion polls showed Yeltsin moving into the lead, but Russian polls have a tradition of inaccuracy, and at least one opinion poll showed Zyuganov with an overwhelming lead. At the same time, all the polls are almost certainly underestimating the appeal of Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the head of the extreme nationalist Liberal Democratic Party.
<P>
The aggressiveness of the Communists, whose constituency includes pensioners, the poor, and others who feel cheated by the reforms carried out over the last five years, has inspired widespread fear. ``If Zyuganov is elected and tries to redistribute property,'' said Vyacheslav Golubtsov, a local newspaper editor in the pro-Communist Kostroma oblast, ``it will be extremely dangerous. Many of the banks belong to criminal groups who have no intention of giving up their property.''
<P>
Many of Russia's new businessmen have taken steps to send both their money and their families out of the country in the event of a Zyuganov victory. At the same time, however, many doubt that Yeltsin will surrender power no matter who wins the election. General Aleksandr Korzhakov, Yeltsin's chief of security and closest confidant, called in May for the postponement of the elections to preserve social peace. As one Yeltsin campaign aide put it, ``We would like to win the election legally. But if that is not possible, Yeltsin is making plans to make sure that he stays in power anyway.'' In any case, there is widespread fear that Yeltsin will falsify the results. According to Kremlin officials, about one-third of the voters will not go to the polls, and the Communists are mobilizing 200,000 poll-watchers to make sure the non-voters' votes are not cast by others.
<P>
The election, in many respects, will be a referendum on five years of reform which have changed Russia beyond recognition. In a country where there were long lines for bread, the stores are now full of goods. In Moscow and St. Petersburg, where twenty years ago a Volkswagen drew a crowd, the streets are choked with traffic and there are many late-model Western cars.
<P>
Nonetheless, there is no guarantee that Russian voters will give a ringing endorsement of reform.
<P>
<P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT>HE direct reason that millions of people are likely to support totalitarian parties is that across the length and breadth of the country, people are not being paid. The situation in Klintsy is typical: paychecks are anywhere from three to eight months behind, and there have been delays in paying pensions, family subsidies, and even ``radiation'' subsidies for those affected by the accident at Chernobyl.
<P>
People are not being paid because there is no money in the government budget. Russia has one of the most confiscatory tax systems in the world, taxing profits at over 90 per cent, but this has not helped the government to collect money. Faced with the choice of breaking the law or going bankrupt, businessmen in Russia regularly do most of their business off the books. Officially, the government collects 70 per cent of the money it requires but, in reality, the figure is believed to be closer to 50 per cent.
<P>
Until 1994, workers in the state sector got paid anyway because the government simply printed money. This, however, led to an inflation rate of 25 to 30 per cent a month, and after Viktor Chernomyrdin became prime minister, the growth in the money supply was sharply reduced. The result was that the inflation rate fell to about 3 per cent a month, but the payment delays started to lengthen.
<P>
In March, Yeltsin announced that all the money owed to those who should have been paid out of the federal budget would be paid. In practice, payment has been uneven from one part of the country to another, and in any case it does not affect the workers in factories which have been privatized.
<P>
These workers are supposed be paid out of the profits of the enterprise, but many of the privatized enterprises have been unprofitable. And so the directors of these enterprises regularly turned to the regional authorities, who tended to help them pay their workers. With the tightening in monetary policies, however, these requests began to be refused. As a result, workers in the ``private'' sector have not benefited even from the halting measures taken to pay state employees.
<P>
Besides the inability of the government to support Russian industry, another reason why workers are not being paid is that in many instances, local officials and factory directors are depositing the payroll in commercial banks in order to collect several months' worth of interest. Depositing money at high interest is a new experience for many Russians, and a psychology has grown up according to which pay for workers is a low priority. As a result, even if a factory director or regional official receives money for salaries, the money will not necessarily be used for its intended purpose.
<P>
The consequences of the payment crisis have been grim. In provincial cities throughout the country children are undernourished and, in some cases, fainting from hunger. Chaos has been created in families, where workers have become dependent on their parents -- whose pensions are still being paid, albeit with delays -- or on their wives who are still receiving subsidies for their children. The life expectancy for men has fallen to 57 years, an all-time low for an industrial nation.
<P>
<P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT>T IS possible that even with the delays in paying salaries, the Russian people would have supported the reforms, but there is an atmosphere of moral degradation which drains people of the will to endure hardship. Its principal sources are knowledge of the reality of the privatization process and the growing domination of organized crime.
<P>
When the privatization of state industry began, workers were promised that they would be able to participate. But, this has not been the case. Recent years did nothing to lessen the difference in living conditions between ordinary citizens and members of the former Communist <I>nomenklatura</I>.
<P>
The years 1990 to 1992 were a period of transition for the <I>nomenklatura</I>, which was mesmerized by the opportunities that reform opened up for acquiring unearned wealth. The law on cooperatives made it possible for factory directors to attach commercial enterprises to their factories and, with the help of creative bookkeeping, divert vast amounts of state resources to private use. When prices were decontrolled in January 1992, these commercial ventures were already active and producing income that the factory directors could constantly reinvest.
<P>
For ordinary people, the situation was quite different. Everything they had was in their savings accounts, the value of which simply melted away in a few weeks of hyperinflation. As a result, by the time Russian enterprises were converted into joint stock companies and everyone was given a supposedly equal chance to own a share of Russian industry, the conditions were already grossly unequal. Workers had nothing but vouchers. These were issued to them for free, but most workers had to sell them under the pressure of sudden impoverishment. The directors and their close aides, at the same time, had vast sums of money which they could use to buy up shares, and they soon emerged as the factories' new owners.
<P>
At the same time as Russia was being treated to what became known as ``<I>nomenklatura</I> privatization,'' the country began to be taken over by organized crime, a development that also had its roots in the period of perestroika. The first private businesses in the Soviet Union were organized at a time when it was illegal to have private guards, and they quickly became the victims of gangs, which demanded a share of their income.
<P>
At first, the gangs restricted themselves to extorting money from the operators of stores and street kiosks, but as they accumulated vast wealth, the criminals went into business and eventually took over banks. The result is that in Russia today virtually all major commercial structures, not to mention the smaller ones, either pay tribute to or are controlled by the criminal world. This is one of the reasons why doing business in Russia is so dangerous. The result of the competitive struggle for markets is frequently that one of the competitors is killed. At the same time, many sources of financing are mafia controlled, and anyone who falls into debt must fear for his life, because Russian criminals will kill a businessman over a debt simply to terrorize others. One year, criminals killed six thousand Russian businessmen and raided over seven hundred company offices, yet there has been little serious effort to investigate the overwhelming majority of these crimes.
<P>
A sign of just how far the situation has gone was the fate of Ivan Kivelidi, the head of the Russian Business Roundtable, an association of private businessmen. As of last July, nine members of the organization's board of directors had been murdered in the previous two years. Kivelidi was well known for his criticism of the links between corrupt bureaucrats, the old <I>nomenklatura</I>, and organized crime. So, in July, he announced his intention to organize and finance resistance to criminal terror against private businessmen. On August 3, he and his secretary, Zara Ismailova, were taken to the hospital with signs of acute poisoning. On August 7, the Ministry of Internal Affairs confirmed that they were the victims of radiation poisoning, reportedly from cadmium.
<P>
<P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT>HERE is a mood of resignation surrounding the elections. It is common to hear someone say that voters face a choice between the ``terrible'' (Yeltsin) and the ``unspeakably horrible'' (Zhirinovsky or Zyuganov), in which case, the obvious choice is the terrible.
<P>
As matters stand, there are four candidates who are expected to do well in the first round of voting: Yeltsin, Zyuganov, Zhirinovsky, and Grigory Yavlinsky, the economist who co-authored the ``500 Days'' program for converting the Soviet Union into a market economy.
<P>
By all indications, Zyuganov has the support of pensioners, collective farmers, army officers who have not been paid, the indigent, and a large percentage of the workers who have not received their salaries. His strength is that he does not seem to have any serious competition for these voters, and their share of the final vote has been variously estimated at between 30 and 35 per cent. Their support could result in Zyuganov's coming in first in the first round of voting.
<P>
Yeltsin draws <I>his</I> support from young people, businessmen who enriched themselves during the period of reform, and Russians in all walks of life who want stability and do not want Zyuganov. Yeltsin's claims that a Communist victory could lead to civil war may be overdrawn, but they touch a responsive chord in people who want a quiet life, distrust the Communists, and are exhausted from decades of social transformations. Yeltsin is now expected to get 25 per cent of the vote, but polls, which may or may not be reliable, suggest his support is rising rapidly.
<P>
The third and most enigmatic candidate is Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who has performed better than expected in every election in which he has run. Zhirinovsky appeals to small businessmen, to Russian chauvinists, and to people living in border regions. He also appeals to those who see in him a man capable of taking decisive action to impose order. His voters often do not admit to pollsters that they intend to vote for him, which makes his share of the vote very difficult to predict. It could, however, be over 15 per cent.
<P>
This leaves Yavlinsky, who is popular with intellectuals and whose program calls for tax reform, job creation, and an immediate end to the war in Chechnya. Yavlinsky, aware that he is unlikely to win, has entered into negotiations with Yeltsin, but so far his asking price -- the post of prime minister -- has been too high. If, as expected, he runs, his vote is likely to be no more than 10 per cent, with the rest of the vote split among other candidates, including General Aleksandr Lebed and an eye surgeon, Svyatoslov Fyodorov.
<P>
Given this likely outcome of the first round of voting, the key to victory in a second round between Zyuganov and Yeltsin is the ability to win over the voters who went for the other candidates, particularly those who voted for Zhirinovsky and Yavlinsky. (The supporters of Lebed and Fyodorov are expected to vote for Yeltsin.)
<P>
Zhirinovsky has joined Yeltsin in warning that a victory for the Communists could lead to civil war, and he will certainly throw his support to Yeltsin in the second round if he does not make it to the second round himself. What cannot be predicted, however, is how many of Zhirinovsky's supporters would follow his advice. His voters are, by nature, oppositionist, and in the past they have been more drawn to the Communists than to Yeltsin despite the fact that Zhirinovsky has been a strong supporter of Yeltsin in the Russian parliament.
<P>
At the same time, it is also not clear whom Yavlinsky's voters will support in the second round. Many might support Yeltsin to head off a victory by the Communists, but anger with Yeltsin over corruption and the Chechen war, coupled with the belief that Yeltsin cannot be considered a democrat, may lead many of them to vote for ``none of the above.''
<P>
<P>
<P><FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT>HE election June 16 will be the first presidential election in Russia's history as an independent state, and it may well be its most fateful. If the Communists win, nearly any of the measures that they have proposed -- from freezing prices on some items to redistributing privatized property -- have the potential for provoking either violence or economic collapse, in that way compelling new and more draconian coercive measures to keep a deteriorating situation under control.
<P>
If Yeltsin wins, however, it is not certain that violence can be avoided. Employing people without paying them is not a long-term solution for a modern economy, and the Yeltsin ``democrats'' no longer have the moral authority to institute far-reaching economic reforms. Eventually, many of the plants that produce products for which there is no demand will need to be closed, and adequate measures will have to be taken to provide for workers who are displaced. To do this, however, requires a state based on law and respect for individual dignity. This is what Yeltsin has not been able to provide.
<P>
What has happened under Yeltsin is that economic reform has been taken as an end in itself and a goal that justified any number of illegal and undemocratic practices. Under these conditions, the government has succeeded not only in unleashing the corrupt elements in a very fragile society but in discrediting for many the idea of reform itself.
<P>
Only a state based on law can start Russia on the path to a better future, but, on the basis of their records, this is something that neither Yeltsin nor Zyuganov can offer to the beleaguered Russian voter.

<p>
<hr> 
<P>
Dear Rusty,
<P>
<!------------------------------------------------------------------------->

<P>

I'm enclosing your FBI file, which I promise I haven't so much as peeked at. A couple of the guys in Leon Panetta's office brought it by -- they're doing some late spring cleaning over there -- and they thought I'd better forward it to you.
<p>
So I guess it's good news, bad news. The good news is that you're cleared at ``all-access'' level, which means that if you and I are planning some day to meet for lunch in the White House Mess, and I'm not in my office, well, you can walk all over the building looking for me and no Marine is going to shoot you. The bad news is that your tax returns were forwarded to the IRS and it's not clear whether you've adequately reported foreign cash income. Apparently, the IRS will be in touch.
<p> 
What can I say? I'm sorry. The stack of files in the ``Al's Friends'' box inadvertently got mixed up with the ones in the ``Known Enemies'' box, and some low-level Army clerk ordered full FBI work-ups on all the names -- from Jim Baker and Tony Blankley right on down to you, Rusty -- and when the files came back, some of them inadvertently got put in the file box marked ``Political Ammo,'' which sat untouched until this spring, when the campaign team started poking around.
<p>
At which point, the whole thing becomes kind of funny, when you look at it the right way. See, all we wanted was the files on the Travel Office personnel. But, apparently, they were using an old list or something, and the whole kit and caboodle came over from the DOJ, and, well, we've been chuckling over this snafu for days, let me tell you.
<p>
The point is, the Travel Office was being run in a slapdash and haphazard way, but now it's run by us, so things are much better. Naturally, the press is having a field day with this. They don't see the humor in it, I guess. And of course, so much of the outcry is politically motivated.
<p>
It was a simple, honest mistake. We requested the FBI files, we received them, we mislaid them. You know, if I had a nickel for every important thing we've mislaid in this Administration . . . well, you know.
<p>
The problem is, this kind of silly event really plays into the Republicans' hands.
<p>
They're trying to run on the ``character'' issue, again, Rusty. I keep telling Bill not to worry, that I've got character enough for both of us, but the truth is, it might work.
<p>
I was talking to Tipper about this over breakfast.
<p> 
``Tipper,'' I said, ``I'm concerned that the Nixonesque overtones of the FBI file debacle -- ''
<p>
``Shhhhhh,'' she said, peering over a pile of pages. ``I'm trying to read.''
<p>
I was quiet for a moment. Then Tipper looked up.
<p>
 ``Guess,'' she said, ``how many unpaid parking tickets Liddy Dole had in 1985.'' 
<p>
``I'm sorry?''
<p>
``Go on. Guess.''
<p>
``Six?'' I said.
<p>
``Try eleven. That's pretty negligent, don't you think?''
<p>
``Tipper,'' I asked firmly, ``what are you reading?''
<p>
``Let's call it opposition research,'' she answered. ``I just wish that Christie Todd Whitman had done a stint for Reagan or Bush,'' she added.
<p>
``Tipper, I'm trying to share with you how I feel about the character issue. And right now, I feel very vulnerable.''
<p>
``Well, you should.''
<p>
``Tip?''
<p>
``Look, Al,'' she said, ``I was the one who said that '96 was the year you should be on the top of the ticket. I was the one who wanted to invite Susan Thomases over for a drink, dust her wine glass when she left, and send the prints to Ken Starr to compare with the ones he lifted from the Rose Law Firm billing records. I was the one who wanted to wear a wire during one of Hillary's 'stonewall-'em' tirades. Each time you said no.'' 
<p>
``You're darn right I did.''
<p>
But Tipper was on a roll. ``So now you come to me,'' she said, ``worrying about the character issue. Well, honey, the only way to combat the character issue is with a character issue of our own.''
<p>
``What does that mean?'' I asked.
<p>
``It means I have a lot of reading to do before these files are discovered by a White House Fellow cleaning out the dust bunnies in the Lincoln Bedroom the day after tomorrow.''
<p>
``What?''
<p>
``Al, don't worry about it. You're going to be late for your 'Corporate Responsibility Summit.'''
<p>
She was right. I gave her a peck on the cheek. Tipper always makes me feel better.
<p>

<H2>Higgonbotham-D'Amato-Hillary
</H2></CENTER>

<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, MAY 28
<P>


At graduation ceremonies at Wesleyan, retired Circuit Court Justice Leon Higginbotham closed by making two requests of the students -- that they should see always, and hear, the pleas of invisible people. He closed, ``I trust that you will never sign on to any contract with America that sanctions or promotes exclusion rather than inclusion of the weak, the poor, women, minorities, and persons of color.''
<p>
A week earlier, Senator Al D'Amato of New York anticipated the injunction of Mr. Higginbotham when (on the Don Imus program) he attacked Newt Gingrich and his policies. ``I think that we do a great disservice to ourselves if we think that people want a Republican Party that is perceived as exclusionary.''
<p>
How do non-invisible people evaluate this kind of thing? They begin by making preliminary distinctions. Judge Higginbotham is an all-time, never-say-die liberal. He has spoken mournfully and eloquently of a childhood and youth wrestling with segregation and prejudice. He distinguished himself at the Yale Law School, was appointed judge by President Kennedy, and seems to be forever committed to any public policies that he identifies as in the interest of black Americans. He actively criticized the judicial record of Justice Clarence Thomas, has appeared jointly with Anita Hill, and has testified in favor of continuing programs of affirmative action.
<p> 
So what does one conclude about his advice to graduating seniors at Wesleyan? That Judge Higginbotham really believes all that business about Republican disdain for the invisible man.
<p> 
Now Al D'Amato is something else, because he is an instructed conservative, who was launched in the Senate by the Conservative Party of New York. What he means to say, when breaking with Newt Gingrich, is that his sense of the political situation is that Gingrich and his programs are unpopular, and, under the circumstances, Al D'Amato retreats from positions he and his party have been associated with for years -- balanced budget, tax reduction, line-item veto, term limits, regulatory reform, and the rest of it.
<p> 
Politicians are forever adjusting their positions to the direction of the wind, so why did Senator D'Amato make such a splash? Because the general view of Senator D'Amato is that, unlike Judge Higginbotham, his views are not fixed. Congressman Gingrich commented, ``I don't know why he is wandering around saying these things.'' That isn't true. Gingrich knows. 
<p>
And a third item over the weekend: we are made privy that the First Lady is thinking of adopting a child. Now even after making the greatest effort to understand her motivations, we must reluctantly pass over as primary an explosive appetite for more maternal experience. Mrs. Clinton chose, after the birth of her only child, not to have a second child; that, or else there were medical reasons for this; but no reason whatever to have kept her from adopting a child at any time during the past 16 years. There are good reasons for First Ladies to send their children home for the length of their husbands' tenure, not many for bringing more babies into the White House. Moreover, Mrs. Clinton is and has been for years one of the liveliest girls in town, distinguishing herself at law school and as a practicing lawyer and as wife of a governor and President, consumed by political life. So what are we to make of her sally?
<p>
That her advisors thought it useful, bringing attention as it does to the hearth-like nature of Bill and Hillary's real life, and incidentally blunting the nails of the nymphs who scratch away at her husband.
<p> 
Why do we fall for such things? What drives the wind that drives D'Amato? Why does Higginbotham really believe (he most certainly does believe it) that the GOP is the enemy of the invisible American?
<p>
Because of the GOP assault on school lunches. That's why! Higginbotham would cite that. Al D'Amato's constituents would cite that. Reduced school lunches are the stigmata of the Invisible American, broken by the wheel of Gingrich.
<p>
What exactly did Mr. Gingrich's Congress propose? The Democrats had scheduled a 5.2 per cent increase in school-lunch money.
<p>
The exclusionary Republicans proposed a 4 per cent increase.
<p> 
It is over such as this that Higginbotham weeps, D'Amato defects, and the Clinton family prospectively grows.

<LI>District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry spent a week at a Maryland retreat to ``engage in a program of spiritual and physical renewal.'' He was not missed. During the Barry years, taxes soared while services plummeted (except insofar as patronage, divvied among the mayor's numerous supporters, was a service). Congress finally had to put the District's affairs under a financial control board. Barry, a recovering drug addict, said his vacation was necessary to prevent a relapse. More likely, the District's relapse into some honest government has been too stressful.

In the shadowy world of spin and furtive self-promotion that is the race to be Bob Dole's running-mate, Ohio Gov. George Voinovich has until recently been on the upswing. Voinovich is popular, Catholic, and from a state rich in electoral votes. Just one problem: he is lacking in conservative hormones. Voinovich recently confessed he just didn't understand why Republicans would try to repeal Clinton's gas-tax increase (``If the deficit is such a problem, how can you be arguing to reduce the gas tax . . . ?'') There's a lot Voinovich doesn't get: he recently proposed re-instating a one-cent tax on soft drinks even after Ohio voters had repealed it; he floated a gas-tax increase after his 1994 re-election; he defends racial preferences, and doggedly resists attempts to require a super-majority in the legislature for passing tax increases. Dole would do better to look to California, where both Attorney General Dan Lungren and Rep. Chris Cox are intelligent, energetic, and conservative. Go West, mature man.

What to make of Felix Rohatyn, long known as a zero-sum economics man and advocate of industrial policy? His lengthy paean to economic growth, published in the Wall Street Journal, could have been written by an RNC staffer. At 2 per cent to 2.5 per cent per year, economic growth is woefully inadequate. Cut capital-gains tax rates. Restrain entitlement growth. Balance the budget in order to satisfy financial markets. Do all this, says Mr. Rohatyn, and we'd tack one percentage point onto the national growth rate, add millions of new jobs, and halt the sickening decline of living standards for those at the bottom of income distribution. Election-year epiphanies are always a bit suspect. (We fully expect the Clinton administration to pre-empt Republican tax-cut efforts with a proposal of its own.) But Rohatyn's musings seem genuine. ``As a traditional Democrat,'' he wrote, ``I have always believed that freedom, fairness, and wealth, basic to modern democracy, required an essentially redistributionist philosophy . . . The experience of the last two decades . . . has very much shaken that view. Fairness does not require the redistribution of wealth; it requires the creation of wealth . . .'' Perhaps he is aware of what fellow Austrian Friedrich Hayek wrote in 1944: ``We are ready to accept almost any explanation of the present crisis . . . except one: that the present state of the world may be the result of genuine error on our part.''

As we write, O. J. Simpson is addressing the Oxford Union. The format calls for him to speak for ten minutes, then answer questions. The Union, in its 175 years, has sponsored guests who are conversant with the subject they address. Normally, they debate a proposition, but there were no invitations issued, as far as we know, to Marcia Clark or Christopher Darden, to argue the only subject on which Mr.Simpson is qualified to speak, namely how to kill a woman and her walking companion in Los Angeles, leave traces vivid enough to light up the Empire State Building, and appear two years later as a guest of the Oxford Union. The New York Post reporter advises that ``British police [at the airport] mounted a massive security operation at public expense to protect Simpson after his request that his bodyguards carry guns was turned down.'' On the subject of the usefulness of guns O. J. is also an expert. Proceeding without them can leave an awful mess.

``We're leaner, meaner, and going nowhere fast.'' Economists ``don't really know'' why. And it has been that way for more than two decades, says New York Times economic reporter Louis Uchitelle. Two decades? Well yes, economic growth over the past 25 years has averaged 2.5 per cent per annum, compared to 4.4 per cent for the prior quarter-century. (Had we maintained the earlier rate, per-capita income would be $10,000 higher today.) But economic stagnation is hardly, as Uchitelle claims, a poorly understood fact of modern life. After all, real GDP grew by one-third from the end of 1982 through 1989. The principal stimulus, most economists say, was the decline in marginal tax rates; letting taxpayers keep more of each added dollar gave them more reason to work and produce. But that wasn't all. This period also saw less government interference in business -- evidenced by a 50 per cent decline in the number of pages of federal regulations issued between 1981 and 1989. And a generally less expansive government: federal spending fell from 23.3 per cent of GDP in 1981 to 21.3 per cent in 1989. Since 1989 all these vectors have reversed. Private employers are feverishly downsizing and investing in new equipment. This strategy will eventually deliver a higher standard of living -- when the government lets it.

Gay-rights activists are about to consummate their Hawaiian gambit. This summer, state judge Kevin Chang is expected to hold, in the case of Baehr v. Lewin, that anti-sex-discrimination language in the state's constitution makes it illegal for Hawaii to refuse marriage licenses to gay couples. Under the ``full faith and credit'' clause of the Constitution, every other state in the Union might be forced to recognize gay marriages sanctioned by Hawaii. In a counter-gambit, Rep. Bob Barr (R., Ga.) and Sen. Don Nickles (R., Okla.) are pushing a marriage-defense bill that would free states from the requirement of honoring same-sex marriages sanctioned in other states, and that defines marriage, for the purposes of federal law, as union between a man and a woman. Not exactly radical stuff. President Clinton is already distancing himself from same-sex marriages. But the bill still puts him in a tight spot. Does he side with his cultural Left or with the vast majority of Americans? Clinton's partial-birth veto suggests the former, which should give voters yet another reason to sue for divorce in the fall.

The U.S. has nondiscriminatory (i.e., normal) trading relations with 150-odd countries, which go under the misleading name of ``most-favored-nation'' (MFN) status. Renewing MFN for China was controversial two years ago, when Tiananmen Square was fresh in people's minds. MFN is now up for renewal again, and is no less controversial this time; added to China's human-rights problems are its sales of nuclear material to various rogue states and its attempt to intimidate Taiwan. But denying MFN is a crude weapon; it would, among other things, devastate Hong Kong's economy. Bob Dole has committed himself to supporting the Administration in seeking renewal. Denying MFN, he says, ``would not free a single dissident, halt a single missile sale, prevent a single threat to Taiwan, or save a single innocent life.'' Quite right.

You know how some people study every syllable uttered by a maximum leader, to try to detect a wind in motion? What did you make of that reference by Franco to Don Juan? -- that he would be appointed successor? What did you make of that dangling participle in Ralph Reed's mention of abortion and the Republican plank? -- that a compromise was in order? Well, we are that way with the New York Times, the ideological Bureau of Weights and Measures. For forty years we've waited to hear the Times refer to somebody or something as ``ultra liberal.'' Not yet, but get this! In a book review last week, Dorothy Gallagher was permitted to get away with a reference to ``the Rosenberg case'' in the context of espionage activity. That is thunderous stuff, suggesting that indeed the Rosenbergs were guilty (they were of course, and everybody has known it for a generation, but the other side hasn't capitulated). More, the reviewer refers to the Institute of Pacific Relations, the snuggery in which Owen Lattimore operated, in a context that clearly suggests he was engaged in subversive activity. Remember Joe McCarthy? He said that Lattimore was his do-or-die case. Lattimore loyalists were as outspoken as the Hiss people. What we have seen is a cataclysmic move.

On the evening of May 12, St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York accommodated a Tridentine Mass, standard in Catholicism from the sixteenth-century Council of Trent until 1963, when Vatican II supplanted it with a new Mass, in the vernacular. Trent represented a largely successful effort to consolidate and regularize Catholic practice in the teeth of doctrinal gales blowing down from Germany and Geneva. Many today see the Latin Mass as a symbol of resistance to the corrosions of modern culture. In his solemn high Mass that morning John Cardinal O'Connor expressed surprise that the Tridentine Mass scheduled for that evening was being viewed by the press as a gesture of discontent within the Church. He professed to see it, rather, as an authorized, indeed normal, occurrence. Yet St. Patrick's has high visibility and, until now, no Tridentine Masses. The celebration was done by Alfons Cardinal Stickler, a visiting cardinal of curial rank. In the evening, Cardinal O'Connor termed it ``historic.'' Four thousand worshippers filled the cathedral. It is difficult to avoid the impression that some vectors may indeed be shifting, and that some of the faithful may be tiring of the John - Jane - Gyp English of the awful contemporary translations.

The Dartmouth Review is on a roll, under the editorship of James S. Panero, a sophomore, no less. The editorial writing is clear, clean, and bright. The rebellious flavor is sui generis sophomore, and can be just plain fun, as witness the latest fusillade at the expense of the arch-enemy, Mr. Freedman, president of Dartmouth. . . . A half-page ad. Collegium Dartmuthens/In Aqua Vitae Conditum A.D. 1770 (a huge wine barrel with roisterers on all sides). Then in huge boldface: ``How much would you contribute in exchange for James Freedman's resignation?/Please fill out this form, cut it out and mail it to: The Committee to Save Dartmouth, P.O. Box 5077, Hanover, N.H. 03755.'' Boys will be, and should be, boys. Crossing the fun-line, however, is a review of the tormented president's latest column. ``If I wrote this way on my class papers, I'd surely fail out of Dartmouth. I am curious now to speak to Freedman in person. I bet he talks with his eyes crossed, or drools . . .'' Icky stuff. And a pity, given the excellence on the whole.

In order not to wound the students' self-esteem, we carefully report the results in language beyond their grasp: 50 per cent of them flunked.

<FONT SIZE=+3>A</FONT>t their weekly meeting on April 22, Republican senators' legislative directors received their marching orders: they were to expect a cloture vote on immigration and then ``stall'' for the rest of the week. For many present, it was a low point in a month in which it had become painfully clear that despite having a majority in both houses of Congress, Republicans were unable to set the national agenda. Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole was ``listless and detached'' in meetings, recalls one Senate aide.
<P>
But that was before Sen. Phil Gramm and Speaker Newt Gingrich raised the issue of a 4.3-cent gas-tax cut. Dole started to demand that any increase in the minimum wage be linked to the cut and to labor-law reform. ``For the first time in a long time . . . Dole was aggressive and focused,'' says the aide. Dole wasn't the only one. Republicans were on the offensive again.
<P>
Even in a city where moods swing more frequently than the First Lady changes her hair style (not to mention her testimony), the effect of such a minor policy feint on the Republican psyche was remarkable. Together with the Clinton Administration's withdrawal of the nomination of the hapless Charles Stack for a federal judgeship, it was enough to pull many Republicans temporarily out of their funk. Yet the gas-tax initiative also highlights the small-mindedness of Republicans. They are prone to go in for measures that are piecemeal, reactive, and tactical.
<P>
Not surprisingly, then, defeatism has continued to plague the GOP. Some Republicans despair of the party's chances of holding onto Congress. Many more treat the Dole campaign as a grim joke. Highly visible spats within the party both result from this defeatism and cause it to deepen. Republicans are clashing over abortion, as usual, but also over campaign strategy, the role of Newt Gingrich, the proper response to organized labor's political resurgence, and the politics of the minimum wage. Participants in these sometimes unpleasant debates include almost every branch of the party: representatives and senators, state party chairmen and governors, conservatives and liberals. And that is the down side of the remarkable Republican success in 1993 - 94: Never before in a modern election has the GOP had to coordinate this many power centers. In 1988 House Minority Leader Bob Michel could have campaigned for Angela Davis and no one would have noticed; now many Republicans draw media attention. There are more Republican governors than at any time in recent memory -- and they are all over the lot ideologically.
<P>
This shows up most clearly on the abortion issue. Congressional Republicans' one unequivocal recent success was the partial-birth-abortion ban, which briefly isolated Clinton as an abortion-rights extremist. Moderate Republicans, however, could not tolerate this state of affairs, and so Governors Whitman, Weld, Wilson, and Pataki quickly diverted attention from President Clinton to intra-Republican squabbling. They announced their intention to lead a platform fight in San Diego. Whitman and Weld even defended Clinton's veto of the partial-birth ban.
<P>
This can perhaps best be understood as the political equivalent of a psychological disorder: Munchausen by proxy, a syndrome which leads sufferers to inflict illnesses on others in order to get attention for themselves. Gov. Whitman, one of the nation's most prominent Republicans, recently graced the cover of the New York Times Magazine under the plaintive headline, ``It's My Party, Too'' -- which certainly suggests a pathological need for attention.
<P>
It also reflects the fact that most abortion-rights Republicans know they can't win a fight at the convention. To judge by the states' delegate selections, the convention could well be dominated by committed social conservatives. Pro-lifers are a majority of even the Massachusetts delegation, much to Gov. Weld's consternation.
<P>
So instead of organizing at the grassroots, these Republicans take their grievances to the national media, which will always lend a sympathetic ear. If they stage a floor fight in San Diego and lose it, they can present the convention to elite opinionmakers as a replay of Houston 1992, thus strengthening their hand for 2000 in the event Dole loses in November. This sort of thing is nothing new. Says Don Devine, a veteran of the Reagan Administration and a prominent Dole supporter, ``I've been involved in Republican conventions for over twenty years, and every Republican convention brings out the 'shoot-the-wounded' Republicans. It's a disease outbreak we have to expect.'' But the weaker the candidate appears, the greater the likelihood that the disease will become an epidemic.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>W</FONT>hich is why Bob Dole's dramatic and wholly unpredicted decision to resign his Senate seat was exactly what the campaign needed. The World's Greatest Deliberative Body, with its individualistic members and arcane procedural traps, was working against bold revival strategies. ``Daschle and Kennedy are beating up on Dole right now, and Clinton has the luxury of sitting back and beating up on the whole process,'' a House aide observed last week. And maverick Republicans typically do some beating up of their own. Sen. John Chafee (R., R.I.) could, for instance, be the undoing of House Republicans' plan to send President Clinton another welfare and Medicaid reform bill. Chafee voted for reforms last year only as part of a historic, comprehensive balanced budget; he is unlikely to support meaningful reform in a stand-alone bill. Since Republicans have a one-vote majority on the Senate Finance Committee, his defection could kill the bill. ``I don't like any strategy that depends on John Chafee,'' says a conservative Senate leadership aide.
<P>
Dole will have to follow up his departure from the Senate with additional moves to reassert his leadership over the party. In the absence of adult leadership, the Republicans have been stealing a page from Lord of the Flies. They are picking on the most vulnerable among them -- and Newt Gingrich is Piggy, the rotund intellectual who gets felled by a rock. Surrounded by these squabbling children, Dole has been acting like a distant older brother. The Republican rank-and-filers who expect him to silence treasonous voices don't appreciate his aversion to conflict and controversy. ``His reputation [as a tough-guy] comes from a few stories newspapers play up, but conflict avoidance is how he really operates,'' explains a veteran Dole-watcher. (His father, Doran Dole, dealt with family conflicts in much the same way.) As majority leader, Dole has always found consensus by persuading and cajoling his colleagues -- not by twisting arms or knocking heads together.
<P>
Take his reaction to a recent foray by his crony Sen. Al D'Amato (R., N.Y.). D'Amato, who appears also to be afflicted with Munchausen by proxy, made waves by echoing liberal rhetoric to the effect that the Republican Congress had gone too far, threatening to inundate the nation with ``dirty drinking water.'' When challenged, D'Amato escalated, attacking Newt Gingrich and the GOP's ``philosophical ayatollahs'' (it wasn't clear which word he meant as an insult). Gov. Pataki joined the chorus, and even conservative Rep. Peter King (R., N.Y.) complained about the House leadership's ``Southern, anti-union attitude that appeals to the mentality of hillbillies at revival meetings.'' A Republican senator summarizes the situation: ``Bob has a lot of friends who are hurting him.''
Not only did Dole make no effort to keep his friends in line; within a week of Sen. D'Amato's first attack on Gingrich, Dole had adopted a kinder, gentler version of it. At a dinner for the GOP's major donors on May 9, Dole said that Republicans may have scared some people by going too far, too fast. The Speaker, he said, has a lot of ideas, and ``some of them are even good.'' This return of the pre-primary-season Bob Dole, anxious to distance himself from Gingrich and the Contract with America, came at an odd time: the Republican Congress is in fact more popular than Dole himself.
<P>
If Dole now means to change course, he still has to move quickly. On some Beltway types' reckoning, the campaign has a roughly six-week window of opportunity during which it must devise its message, approach conservative groups with it, and set them to work. If that doesn't happen and conservatives are left out, more of them will start saying they have no stake in Dole's election and that they will work for lower-level conservative candidates.
<P>
And who will tell straying Republicans that they had better get back with the party line? In 1988, would-be mavericks feared James Baker; nobody really thinks Scott Reed will come back to haunt them. One solution to both these problems would be to place a recognized heavyweight like Haley Barbour in charge of the campaign. The appointment of the aggressive Republican National Committee chairman would help greatly with both the message and the presentation, causing defeatists to take a long second look at the campaign.
<P>
Those defeatists have been thick on the ground recently. Conspiracy-minded conservatives suspect that some of the Dole-bashers want to tear him down so that he will be forced to pick Colin Powell as his vice-presidential nominee in order to remain viable. But the likely conservative dominance of the convention makes the Dole campaign wary of offering the vice-presidential nomination to Powell. Those opposed to a self-described ``Rockefeller Republican'' on the ticket wouldn't have to wait until November to express displeasure; they could embarrass the campaign, or even defeat the nomination, in San Diego. Which would be just as well: a Powell pick would hardly invigorate the demoralized Republican base.
<P>
A more charitable explanation is that some conservatives have been trying to position themselves as best they can in case of a blowout Dole defeat. That is certainly what is going on in the Republican Congress. When staffers are told that the passage of their pet bill would help Clinton, they often shrug and say, He's going to be re-elected anyway, so we may as well get the best deal we can while he's renting our issues. That attitude is particularly pervasive among that subgroup of Hill staffers known in Washington shorthand as ``policy people,'' but plenty of congressmen will say the same thing off the record. ``It's every man for himself'' is a phrase we hear with tiresome regularity on the Hill these days.
<P>
One good reason for Republican congressmen to be nervous is that, if their leaders have developed a new grand strategy since the dissolution of the Contract, they have yet to disclose it. As noted above, it has been all reaction, not a bold new attack.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT>he rest of the panic is media-driven. One month the rap is that Republicans have gone too far, the next that they haven't done enough. The same Republicans go wobbly each time. All but the most steel-willed -- like House Majority Leader Dick Armey and Reps. Bob Walker (Pa.), John Boehner (Ohio), and Bob Livingston (La.) -- have lost the intellectual self-confidence needed to make the principled arguments against superficially popular proposals like boosting the minimum wage, or to take up new issues. They assume Clinton and the Democrats will be able to run rings around them in terms of tactics and public relations.
<P>
A disgusted Hill aide argues, ``It's like being a salesman and never going to customers because they don't think they'll be able to convince them. We have a lot of members who just do focus groups and polls but never go out there and make the arguments. They should find another way to make a living.'' Congressmen are coming into D.C. on Tuesdays and leaving on Thursdays, eager to spend time in their districts. 
<P>
Many conservative House members were outraged when they learned  that Gingrich had told moderate Rep. Chris Shays (R., Conn.) that if he wanted a vote on raising the minimum wage, he should get like-minded colleagues to sign a letter to the Speaker so that he could say he was forced to schedule one. In other words, his ``capitulation'' was orchestrated. When pressed on the issue by conservatives, Gingrich crassly defends a minimum-wage boost as ``an 80-20 issue'' (i.e., 80 per cent of the public favors it). The episode sheds light on the Speaker's leadership style and ideological malleability, and has allowed Dick Armey and Whip Tom DeLay to burnish their conservative credentials at the Speaker's expense. This leadership jockeying leads some on the Hill quietly to predict that Gingrich won't be Speaker next year even if the Republicans retain their majority. The lack of gratitude for his role in creating that majority in the first place is astonishing.
<P>
Rank-and-file Republicans cannot be expected to defer their intra-party battles until after the elections when highranking officials set a contrary example. The leadership that should be keeping them in line is part of the problem. Furthermore, as political analyst Stuart Rothenberg recently wrote, ``It's important to note that activists from both wings of the Republican Party share the blame'' for the recent fratricide. Conservatives and moderates also share problems that could be corrected if given some of the attention currently reserved for attacks on each other. All Republicans are too apt to complain about the lessons of the last year rather than absorbing them. For instance, they gripe about press bias and Clinton's demagoguery and duplicity. These are facts of life; complaining about them is pointless and can easily come across as whining (which is how some recent Gingrich remarks played).
<P>
Moreover, Republicans continue to suffer from communications problems going well beyond Bob Dole's rhetorical deficiencies. For the last year they have talked about means, legislative tools, while Clinton talked about ends; they rarely bothered to lay out the intellectual predicates for the policy changes they wished to enact. Too many congressmen still think they're in production rather than sales. Part of the solution is simply for Republicans to present their best face to the public. For example, Rep. Steve Largent (Okla.) should be joined by another Republican with star quality -- say, Sen. Fred Thompson (Tenn.) -- in pushing the Defense of Marriage Act. And for a party that sets so much store by federalism and civil society, Republicans are much too given to relying on the usual Beltway suspects, while underutilizing the wealth of talent outside the inner circle. On crime, for example, the public face of the GOP should not be Rep. Bob Barr (Ga.); it should be Charleston police chief Reuben Greenberg. On morals, ``Best Friends'' head Elaine Bennett, not her husband, Bill, should lead the way. On economics, it should be Godfather pizza exec Herman Cain, not professorial congressmen, expounding Republican views.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>A</FONT> real and lasting Republican recovery, however, will require more substantive steps. There is widespread agreement among Republicans that tax cuts must be an important part of the fall campaign. ``A broad-based, true-blue tax cut is the quickest way to the hearts and minds of the American people,'' says pollster Kellyanne Fitzpatrick. ``A quick and easy tax cut signals all Americans that the Republican Party wants to give them immediate relief and long-term hope.''
<P>
A leading Democratic operative recently told the L. A. Times that it was imperative to avoid ``a debate in which the primary difference between us is they want to cut taxes and we don't.'' And -- the most hopeful thing we've heard in many a day -- the Dole campaign is actually considering a 15 per cent across-the-board cut in income taxes. But watch that word ``considering'': campaign advisors complain that nothing has been firmly decided. And indeed, by obsessing about the deficit over the last year, Republicans have painted themselves into a corner where many feel uncomfortable proposing major tax cuts. They will have to be ready to answer charges of hypocrisy if they adopt a tax-cutting strategy now.
<P>
Republicans still have time to recover their footing. In generic ballots (where respondents are asked whether they would rather vote for a Democrat or a Republican for Congress), the GOP has pulled even -- which is ahead of where they were at this time in 1994. Even at the presidential level, Clinton's lead in the polls is much narrower among ``likely voters'' than among registered voters (the more-often-cited figure). And Clinton has vulnerabilities on the economy and on foreign policy that have barely begun to be explored.
<P>
That doesn't mean the GOP should be complacent; indeed, those Republicans who aren't defeatists may be banking too much on the passage of time and the magic of a national convention to restore their fortunes. But it does mean that there's no reason for concern to take on the coloration of panic. The distribution of open seats in Congress continues to favor Republican candidates; and since candidate recruitment took place at a time when Republicans looked stronger, the GOP is fielding a higher-quality team than the Democrats are. The sheer magnitude of the Democrats' task in retaking Congress is being widely underestimated.
<P>
Many conservatives have little patience with those who moan that Congress could be lost in November but never do anything constructive to prevent that from happening. Gingrich recently told the Washington Times, ``If [Bill] Bennett thinks the party needs excitement and passion, then Bennett should go out and be exciting and passionate.'' Adds tax activist Grover Norquist, ``It's a sin for people to whine that nobody's articulating the message when they're not articulating the message themselves. This is not a monarchy -- we don't wait for Bob Dole.''
<P>
A Republican collapse is by no means inevitable. If Republicans are willing to stop blaming each other for a November rout and start working to avoid it, they can still not only hold their congressional majorities, but expand them and recapture the White House as well. But they can't wait till October.

Dear Rusty,
<P>
<!---------------------------------------------------------------------------->
Rusty
<P>
I've got to be totally honest with you, Rusty: it's nice to be on the winning team. I haven't felt this confident about things since the night before Super Tuesday in 1988, and let me tell you, after the first couple of rocky years of the Clinton - Gore Administration, this feels nice. But, Rusty, I never knew how much fundraising we were in for. In the past few weeks, Tip and I have been out every night. If we're not at a dinner dance for the DNC, then we're at a black-tie fundraiser for the Clinton - Gore '96 campaign. 
<P>
As you would imagine, the cynical press has raised its collective eyebrow over our fundraising efforts, even going so far as to suggest that what we're doing is ``selling access,'' to which I reply, That's only a danger if you think the President is some kind of wishy-washy weather vane, who adopts the opinion of the last person he spoke to. And that pretty much ends that. We're doing what every political party has to do: we're holding a few simple fundraising events. 
<P>
I'm sitting here in the tub, enjoying a quiet moment before Tipper and I have to get dressed up for ``Victory 1996: A Celebratory Dinner for Very Special Over-One-Mil-a-Year People.'' Last year, if you remember, after the pretty dismal 1994 election, we had to cancel the VSOP Dinner; this year, we filled up the Capitol Hilton ballroom twice! Once for lunch (``Victory 1996: A Celebratory Lunch with a Powerful Bureaucrat of Your Choice'') and once for the VSOP Dinner. 
<P>
As if that wasn't enough, there are a lot more events this week: ``Victory 1996: A Celebratory Breakfast with the President of the United States,'' which was oversold the moment it was announced. That prompted Bill, very generously I may add, to offer to eat more than one breakfast a day, for, as he put it, ``as long as the party needs me to.'' So now we've got Breakfast I and Breakfast II, for ``Golden Juice'' level donors (over $150,000); Luncheon I and Luncheon II with me, Tip, Bill, and HRC for donors at the ``Welcome to the Club Sandwich'' level (over $200,000); and the VSOP Dinner for those at the ``Fatted Calf'' level (over $300,000 over and over again). 
<P>
And that's just Tuesday. Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday we do it all over again. The sad part is, Tipper was feeling bloated after Luncheon I, so I had to caution her to pace herself. 
<P>
Next Monday, in what I think is a poignant tribute to the late Ron Brown, we're doing something he came up with. He called it the ``Businessman's Special,'' but we're calling it, in his honor, ``Victory 1996: A Very Special Tribute to Ron Brown.'' It's a simple buffet lunch with the Under-Secretary of your choice. Typically, what Ron liked most about the idea was the simplicity: ``Businessmen don't have a lot of time for the niceties. They don't want to talk to the guy at the top, they want to talk to the guy who makes the decisions,'' I can still hear him say. 
<P>
And when it came to making a decision about trade policy for China, we held a dinner called ``Victory 1996: MFN for China?'' and we were gratified by the response from Kodak, Lehman Brothers, Caterpillar, Citibank, Ford Motor Corp., Bechtel, Amoco, Goldman Sachs, Schering-Plough, PacTel, Wal-Mart, Coca-Cola, Chase, American International Group, Boise Cascade . . . and that's just to name the CEOs at my table. Bill was at a table for two dozen CEOs, which was made manageable by the very Chinese touch of a Lazy Susan - type arrangement which allowed Bill to kind of spin around the table every few minutes to give every diner ``his money's worth,'' as Bill put it. 
<P>
What's great about our lead over Dole in the polls (21 per cent and climbing!) is that, first of all, Bill's starting to get the kind of numbers that I've been getting so there isn't any more of that awkwardness between us. And second, now that our team has the winning edge, everyone wants to be on it. 
<P>
Hazel O'Leary, our Secretary of Energy (who is an African-American, as if that made a difference) held a dinner last week called ``Victory 1996: A Dialogue on the Gas Tax.'' The great thing was that every ticket was bought by Chevron. 
<P>
Bob Rubin over at Treasury put together a nifty brunch called ``Victory 1996: Behind the Scenes at the IRS,'' which was oversold the moment the invitation appeared on the Bloomberg. He's offered to take it ``on the road,'' as he puts it. That ought to pay for some 30-second spots in the fall, huh? 
<P>
Of course, I don't want you to get the impression that it's all about money. It's about a lot of other things that I could name, but Tipper just called up that the limo is waiting, so I'd better go.

<P>
NEW YORK, MAY 7
<P>
These are hard times for Newt Gingrich, as everybody concedes. A month ago the story was out that House members in troubled seats were discouraging any prospect of a visit by the Speaker to endorse their candidacies. On Saturday, a left-oriented comedian, performing at the annual White House Correspondents dinner, enjoyed himself and a (very) few others by making jokes about every aspect of Gingrich's life, including his 13-year-old daughter's rites of puberty.
<P>
What is accepted as the Dick Morris formula is paying off. Clinton's instructions are to sound like a conservative/moderate in his speeches, while pursuing the left agenda as Chief Executive. He adroitly exploits the Republican ambiguists in the House and in the Senate. NR's Rich Lowry cites the debate over a welfare bill as an example. ``By the time Senate moderates are through with it, [the bill] could actually produce a presidential signature rather than a veto. What to do? 'Here's what we lay out for ourselves,' complains one Senate aide. 'If we pass it and he signs it -- we lose. If we pass it and he vetoes it -- we didn't get anything done. And if we don't pass it, he can't veto it -- but we're do-nothing. So, therefore, we lay out a scenario where whatever we do and whatever he does -- we lose.'''
<P>
Most conservative analysts are closing in on the matter of taxes. Mr. Gingrich is of course in favor of reduced taxation, but the accent he has placed on a balanced budget has got in the way of a political crusade on the subject. It is correct that there is danger in coming out for tax cuts without corresponding spending cuts. But it is also correct that Mr. Clinton has succeeded in framing any tax-cut proposal as an assault on the poor. And when Mr. Gingrich decided on military action and laid down his siege, he discovered that the leader of the besieged had the critical megaphone in hand, which he used repeatedly to criticize the army outside the moat, whose soldiers got colder, and hungrier, and lonelier as they struggled -- in the eyes of the American public -- to deny students and old folks access to the Statue of Liberty and the Library of Congress. 
<P>
The conviction is growing that the way to go is with a resounding call for tax cuts. When asked what spending cuts he would endorse, the typical Republican will come up with a favorite target or two, and then go vague. Even Pat Buchanan, campaigning for President in 1992, could not come up with recommended cuts of more than 1 per cent. That's the kind of thing that happens to people who engage in political life, even if their name is Ronald Reagan. That's the reason so much of the public is saying: Give us a tax cut -- and you figure out how and where to save the money. And at a more sophisticated level, there are those who are saying: Give us a tax cut with heavy emphasis on capital gains and please note the ensuing harvest. If Jack Kemp were omnipotent, he would cut taxes on productive activity and confidently predict that gross revenues would rise at least sufficient to make up the predicted revenue loss.
<P>
Newt Gingrich is overwhelmed by the political question. He has responsibilities not faced by opinion merchants. Thus on the minimum wage he makes his point, in order to stay on good terms with his philosophical network; but then capitulates, on the grounds that flesh-and-blood Americans who are running for re-election can't fight back against the charge that they would deny a worker a better wage than the current minimum. 
<P>
Even so, it isn't only sedentary Republicans who believe the time has come for Mr. Gingrich to return to the theoretical fastness. In the last analysis, the vitality of the conservative movement has got to depend on the communicability of truths. It is an untruth that the minimum wage helps the very poor, and the question then becomes, Is this one of the battles on which we should weigh in? There are two points of view on this, but a reduction in taxes is increasingly accepted as indispensable to philosophical prosperity, as well as political success. 
<P>
Newt Gingrich is greatly gifted. Maureen Dowd of the New York Times wrote over the weekend. ``Is he impressed with the way Dick Morris has refashioned Mr. Clinton's image as mature centrist?'' 
<P>
``Laurence Olivier plays many roles,'' Gingrich replied. ``If you stipulate somebody as a good actor, why should it surprise you when they act well? Is somebody who's always sincere ever sincere?'' You can't do better than to think your way through to such observations, or to phrase them that way. Newt Gingrich will be around for a good while, and that is welcome news.

The ease with which Newt Gingrich, Bob Dole, and their troops buckled under pressure on the minimum wage betokens an emptiness at the center of the Republican Congressional agenda. For nearly two years the GOP has neglected the pocketbook concerns of average voters, talking instead about budget-balancing and Medicare-fixing that by some time in the next century might have reduced long-term interest rates enough to make it easier to re-finance your mortgage while the Medicare Trust Fund inches its way back into solvency -- according to the latest CBO Trust Fund report, of course. No wonder the minimum wage seems like a vivid issue by comparison. Meanwhile, on other economic issues, House Majority Leader Dick Armey is on the right track with a package -- now endorsed by Gingrich -- that is likely to include the $500-per-child tax credit (the GOP's lone recent stab at serious middle-class tax relief) and other measures to get the government's hands off people's take-home pay. Gingrich and Dole are on the right track, too, with their call for a repeal of Clinton's gas-tax increase. But as long as Republicans are tame about taxes Clinton will co-opt them; he already has his own package of tax credits and is making favorable noises about a gas-tax repeal. The GOP can reach for bolder stuff -- actual cuts in tax rates -- or run on empty all the way to November..

Boris Yeltsin let the cat out of the bag in a Kremlin news conference on April 21, with his running-mate Bill Clinton standing beside him. The issue was NATO enlargement. Beaming with pleasure, Yeltsin said it was not being pushed right now, that the delay was ``at our request,'' and that his friend Bill had ``promised this.'' Moreover, no new members were going to get into NATO without Russia's agreement, or without changes in the nature of NATO itself. Clinton squirmed, and tried to claim in response that nothing in U.S. policy had changed. That, indeed, is the problem. When NR Senior Editor Peter Rodman wrote last year (``On the Scene,'' December 25) that the Administration had assured Moscow that NATO enlargement wasn't going to happen any time soon, the official denials were hot and heavy. Apparently, no one told Boris -- then or now.<p>

Only 10 per cent of the nation's newspaper editors, according to a recent poll, think that President Clinton has ``a clear foreign policy''; a whopping 83 per cent think he just ``reacts to foreign events.'' Nevertheless, 64 per cent of the editors approve of the foreign-policy job Clinton is doing. By a margin of 42 - 34, they think Bob Dole would do an even better job, which may mean, extrapolating from their Clinton answers, that they think his foreign policy would be even less clear.<p>

Oops. That wasn't supposed to happen. At least not yet. Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund is already spending more than it takes in -- $4.2 billion more in the first half of the fiscal year. Only last April the Administration had predicted a surplus. Those of you who pay (and pay, and pay, and pay) the Medicare tax are entitled to an explanation. Unfortunately, no one has come up with one: ``Hospital admissions of Medicare patients are rising more than can be explained by the number of beneficiaries . . .'' is the best a spokesman for the American Hospital Association can do. Both parties agree on the need for cuts. The hang-up is over philosophy. The Administration's plan calls for the same top-down price controls that have failed Medicare for thirty years, while Republicans want to give beneficiaries a choice between the current system, and a combination of private, high-deductible insurance, paid for by the government, and Medical Savings Accounts to help cover out-of-pocket expenses. Meanwhile, if we bumble along as at present, the Trust Fund will probably deplete its balance before the 2002 date usually forecast for that unpleasant event. And then the baby boomers start retiring.<p>

Labor Secretary Robert Reich recently credited the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) with the decline in national workplace fatalities that has occurred since it was created in 1970. But two economists, Thomas J. Kniesner and John D. Leeth, in the latest issue of the Cato Institute journal Regulation, say that Reich is like the doctor who claims to have cured you when in fact you were recovering by yourself before he first saw you. Workplace accidents were declining just as steadily in the decades before OSHA went to work as since. ``It is hard to conclude,'' say Kniesner and Leeth, ``that OSHA passes even the minimum criterion for the establishment of any government program, namely, Is it effective?'' (One quibble for the economists: Since when was that a criterion for establishing government programs?)<p>

When Joe Conason of the New York Observer, a left-liberal, defended the Clintons on Whitewater, Alexander Cockburn of the New York Press, a Stalinist who despises liberals, wrote that Conason ``huffs and puffs like an elderly walrus.'' Conason called Cockburn ``incompetent and dishonest'' and a purveyor of ``lying bulls -- ,'' Cockburn called Conason a ``hack Democratic apologist for a couple of sleazeballs'' and a ``scream[ing] child,'' and so the two-party system came to New York journalism.<p>

When you raise the price of a good or service, the demand for it goes down. This, in a nutshell, is why most economists think that raising the minimum wage is a bad idea. It is estimated that a 90-cent increase (to $5.15 per hour) would eliminate 200,000 entry-level jobs by 1999. David McIntosh, a leading House freshman from Indiana, has a better idea for helping low-income workers. He would allow minimum-wage-earning taxpayers to keep the federal taxes currently withheld from their paychecks. Employers would not see any increase in the cost of labor under the McIntosh plan, and so the demand for low-skilled labor would not fall. Low-income families would enjoy higher after-tax income than under the proposed minimum wage. Preliminary estimates put the cost of this tax cut at $8 to $10 billion annually -- equal to about 10 per cent of next year's welfare spending. The resulting tighter welfare system will increase the number of the disadvantaged looking for work; the McIntosh tax cut will make it easier for employers to hire them.<p>

When Darrell Cabey teamed up with some other toughs to bully five dollars out of Bernhard Goetz, he never could have imagined the heist would eventually earn him $43 million in a civil suit. But thanks to his radical attorney, a Bronx jury, and an inept defense, Cabey is nominally America's most successful mugger. Think what you will about Goetz's culpability (he may have fired more bullets at the men preying on him than necessary), that decision belonged to the criminal court, which acquitted him of all serious charges. The question of whether Cabey deserved indemnification for the injury he sustained is easy. The law prohibits felons from profiting from their crimes; Cabey was out to rob. Even if Goetz had thrown a grenade at Cabey, he wouldn't be entitled to a penny. To a criminal, gunshot wounds are an occupational hazard, like housemaid's knee. Fortunately, Goetz happens to be penniless, so Cabey will end up getting what he deserves -- once again.<p>

Francois Mitterrand admitted posthumously in his memoirs that the purpose of European integration was to ``obtain independence from America.'' No surprise here: Mitterrand declared years ago that he preferred countries you could reach by land -- which evidently meant that he liked the Soviet Union more than the United States. Although Mitterrand's attitude to NATO was sounder than that of his predecessors, he still believed Europe to be an entity with values distinct from, and threatened by, those of the Atlantic Community. American policymakers will blunder if they continue to think that all forms of European integration are necessarily in America's interest. As a senior German politician explained with candor last month, a European defense identity -- an idea Mitterrand long advocated precisely because it implies a reduced American component -- was a way of reassuring (i.e., appeasing) Moscow. He added that Russia should belong to a pan-European security structure, simply because Russia was ``in Europe,'' while the American presence was optional.  Anyone who thinks that way is guaranteed to repeat some unpleasant European history.<p>

As reported in New York magazine, some black students at Columbia Law School set out to do something about the problem of racist cab drivers: after videotaping cabbies who refused to pick them up, they would report the drivers to the city for $500 fines. However, the sting did not work as planned. When one student wore a Columbia sweatshirt, every cab picked him up and agreed to take him to whatever destination he named, even to the heart of Harlem. However, when he was joined by a classmate in a dark hat and lumberjack shirt, 14 out of 15 cabs zoomed past. Two conclusions: 1) Cab drivers don't mind picking up blacks per se. 2) Cab drivers do mind picking up young men dressed according to the sartorial standards of criminals. And for many youngish black men in New York, including law-abiding ones, it is the height of fashion to dress like a thug: low-slung jeans, hooded sweatshirts, etc. Giving new meaning to the phrase ``fashion victim,'' taxi drivers figure that you are what you wear. The minute the real criminals figure this out and start wearing Ivy League athletic clothes, it will become impossible to drive a cab in New York.<p>

Fox News has entered the Sunday-morning TV competition with a news/interview show of its own. Official Washington was wary, given the conservative field markings -- Roger Ailes heads the Fox news division, and Tony Snow, the show's host, was an editor at the Washington Times and a Bush speechwriter. But the first show on April 28 corralled a bipartisan line-up of Dick Gephardt, Pat Moynihan, John Kasich, Linda Chavez, and Robert Shrum, along with top Israeli official Uri Savir. The show was fair and lively, an auspicious debut. Good sailing.<p>

He contends that the S&P 500 Index (reinvestment of dividends included) will outperform Mr. Dizard's choice -- gold bullion as measured by the Comex Spot -- over the following period:

                4/29/96    12/31/97

<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>W</FONT>HAT a difference an era can make. When free-market entrepreneurial economics were revived during the Age of Reagan, and classical thinkers such as Friedrich Hayek, Milton Friedman, and Joseph Schumpeter replaced John Maynard Keynes, John Kenneth Galbraith, and Paul Samuelson, the American economy flourished on a grand scale.
<P>
From 1982 to 1995, the Dow Jones industrial average increased 300 per cent (adjusted for inflation), or 11 per cent per year. All told, a phenomenal performance. Along the way, roughly 100 million Americans who own stocks and bonds (through brokerage accounts, mutual funds, IRAs, and other retirement plans) saw their net worth go up by an extraordinary $10 trillion, a 176 per cent gain, which annualizes to 8.1 per cent. From this rising wealth base, the U.S. economy created 29 million new jobs and produced a whopping 43 per cent gain in real disposable income. No other G-7 industrial nation has come close to this performance. It's a fact. You can look it up.
<P>
During the prior Age of Inflation, which I mark as 1965 to 1982, Democratic and Republican Presidents alike practiced Keynesian fine-tuning, de-linked the dollar from gold, inflated the money supply, raised taxes, imposed wage and price controls, and maintained tight government regulation over key economic sectors such as banking, transportation, and energy. Meanwhile, the U.S. stock market <I>declined</I> by 67 per cent (adjusted for inflation), dropping by an average of 6.5 per cent per year.
<P>
Of course, in recent years Reagan's tax-cut policies have been compromised, first by George Bush and then by Bill Clinton. But the damage so far has been manageable, and the tide has not yet turned back out to sea. The top income-tax rate, which stood at 70 per cent during the Age of Inflation, is now holding at 40 per cent. The 28 per cent capital-gains tax rate is much lower than the 45 per cent during the 1970s. Corporate-income-tax rates are in the low 30s, compared to their hefty earlier perch of the mid 40s. The inflation rate in recent years has hovered near 2 per cent; it was 10 to 15 per cent during the last years of the Age of Inflation. Interest rates today run from roughly 5 to 7 per cent; they were 15 to 20 per cent 15 years ago.
<P>
Just as important, although Reagan himself has departed from the public square, his <I>spirit</I> lingers on, especially among the new generation of business leaders that was spawned during the Eighties. These men and women came to live by the Schumpeterian growth model of innovation and risk-taking. They started new businesses on a massive scale, they modernized business practices through downsizing and consolidation, and they instituted sophisticated financial-management techniques every step of the way. Their footprints are found throughout the economy, in computer tech, telephone tech, information processing, autos, utilities, transportation, steel, textiles, and electronics.
<P>
And they went global. For it was Reagan who first opened free trade in Latin and Central America, then negotiated throughout the Pacific Rim, including China, and it was Reagan's political economy that caused Soviet Communism to implode, thus re-opening Central and Eastern Europe, then South Asia, and even kindling hope in the Middle East. In short, American -- not German, not British, not Japanese, but American -- business has provided the leadership and cutting-edge management infrastructure for the worldwide spread of democratic capitalism.
<P>
All that said, there is however a growing sense, at least in stock-market circles, that the best of our story may have passed. In recent months the market has stalled, interest rates have again started to rise, and inflation risk is in the air. A year ago, buoyed by the Republican capture of both houses of Congress, many believed that 1995 would bring a new installment of Reagan's agenda: another round of pro-growth tax cuts, serious entitlement reform, more deregulation, and substantially smaller government.
<P>
Yet none of this came to pass. Speaker Gingrich showed himself to be a shrill, uncompromising, and unpopular figure, unable to grow into the job. As a unit, the House Republicans were obsessed with dreary numerical budget formulas and the politics of austerity and sacrifice. Gone was Reagan's message of optimism and growth. By early 1996 the Contract with America was dead in the water, and its underlying policy agenda of tax cuts, smaller government, and cultural reformation had been tattered and muddled.
<P>

<FONT SIZE=+3>W</FONT>HAT'S more, politicians ranging from Pat Buchanan to Dick Gephardt have emphasized the darker side of the economic story. Real median family income, they have been pointing out, has slumped in recent years after recovering nicely during the 1980s. And Social Security and Medicare payroll-tax increases have eroded take-home pay.
<P>
Of course, when measured <I>properly</I>, the worker wage story over the past twenty years is quite a bit more respectable. Wage data exclude a sizable chunk of the modern worker's real compensation: health care, retirement, vacations, holidays, sick leave, and so on. When those generally untaxed benefits are added in per-worker annual income has been rising at a rate of 1.4 per cent. And, as the wealth numbers suggest, somebody has made good money. Even going back to the early 1970s, real per-capita consumption has averaged 1.7 per cent yearly increases.
<P>
Whatever the correct data, though, today's political reality reflects a cranky <I>attitude</I> of restlessness, irritability, and discontent among a major population segment. Many middle-income workers -- one might think of them as Reagan Democrats -- simply do not believe they have the financial resources to take care of their businesses or their families. In social and cultural terms the deck is stacked against them: racial quotas, illegal immigration, liberal courts, no-fault divorce, generation X dress codes, rampant welfarism, schools without prayer (or education), and government opposition to moral standards. To defend against moral slippage -- by putting their kids into private or parochial schools, for example -- middle-class folk need financial resources.
<P>
For this group, President Clinton's tired old big-government nostrums just won't work. Nostalgic for the social-insurance welfarism of Germany, France, and Sweden, Clintonites such as Robert Reich, Laura Tyson, Jeff Bingaman, and Byron Dorgan have come up with a program of higher minimum wages, more health care, more federal education money, more union power, more caps on executive pay, more community investment schemes financed by corporate pensions, and more limits on layoffs and restructuring.
<P>
Fact is, nearly everyone in America knows this stuff won't work. It never has. Just look at Europe, where a social-democratic model has maintained double-digit unemployment and blocked private job creation. More to the point, American politics has never favored class warfare or zero-sum economic pessimism. A few months ago a <I>Reader's Digest</I> poll showed that ``Americans in nearly every group -- across racial, economic, age, ideological, religious, educational, and sexual lines -- had the same median response: A family of four with an income of $200,000 should pay no more than 25 per cent in all its taxes combined.'' Polltaker Everett Ladd called it ``the single most extraordinary finding in the history of domestic-policy polling in the U.S. . . . America is probably the only country in the world where there are no significant differences by party or class in the 'ideal' fair tax.'' In other words, class warfare doesn't work.
<P>
But you cannot beat something with nothing. At this point, future economic policy and the stock market both stand at the crossroads. It is up to Senator Dole to renew and reinvigorate the optimistic economics of Ronald Reagan. This presidential election will not be fought over income inequality and redistribution, or over austere numerical balanced-budget plans, unless Republicans allow it to happen. And if they allow it to happen, they will lose.
<P>
To regain the political and economic high ground, the GOP should hark back to the 1993 gubernatorial campaign of underdog candidate Christine Todd Whitman. During the final weeks of her uphill quest, Mrs. Whitman hammered home one simple, clear message to the voters of New Jersey: ``You will spend your money more wisely than the government will.'' On this impeccable premise, her plan to slash income taxes across the board catapulted her to victory over incumbent Jim Florio, who had enacted the largest tax increase in New Jersey history. And it was Mrs. Whitman's plucky adherence to a bold economic growth plan that started the national Republican Party on the road to political resuscitation in the aftermath of George Bush's devastating defeat.
<P>
For Senator Dole, who campaigned hard for Mrs. Whitman, the lessons are very clear. Across-the-board income-tax cuts generate a powerful message of traditional family values because they show trust in ordinary people, who will spend their own money more wisely than government will. American families are more than willing to accept the risk and responsibility of making personal choices with regard to education (vouchers), health care (portability and medical savings accounts), and retirement (unlimited IRAs invested in private markets).
<P>
Add to the merits of personal responsibility the related demand for governmental accountability. Taxpayers insist that large-scale entitlements such as welfare and Medicaid be turned over to the states, where legislatures and governors will be more responsive to voter preferences than far-away Washington. People are increasingly convinced that generational welfare dependency, alcohol and drug addiction, family break-up, unlimited abortion on demand, and recidivist criminal pathologies are more closely related to soul-sickness than to the absence of material benefits. Ordinary people intuitively know that working together, through local churches, synagogues, schools, charities, fellowships, and self-help groups, is the only lasting solution to our nation's social and cultural problems.
<P>
Of course, across-the-board income-tax-rate relief is not only a values issue: it is also an <I>economics</I> issue because of the favorable impact on incentives. Tax credits are more manna from Washington, part of the old model that elites know best. Bill Clinton is at home with his own scheme for tax credits because it preserves the centrality of governmental planning, prioritizing, and allocation. The Clinton Administration simply does not trust the populace. Because of this, it will never agree to income-tax-rate cuts. Senator Dole, however, is in a position to -- and must -- acknowledge that those who work harder, save more, and are willing to invest must be rewarded through the incentive structure of lower marginal income-tax rates.
<P>
Today, a family-owned business that grosses $50,000 per year pays income tax at a 28 per cent rate and Social Security/Medicare payroll taxes at a 16 per cent rate. In most of the twenty largest population centers, state and local taxes take another 5 per cent. So, right off the top, the combined marginal tax rate takes away nearly 50 cents of every middle-class dollar earned. Senator Dole must champion the forgotten middle class with a bold across-the-board income-tax cut. Lower tax rates, higher tax-bracket thresholds, and a payroll tax deduction are far more powerful instruments of growth than government-given tax credits. After-tax take-home pay will go up; fresh incentives to earn, work, save, and invest will rejuvenate overall economic growth. And people will have much greater opportunity to form their own priorities, run their own businesses, and care for their own children.<P>
Income-tax relief can be seen as a down payment on future, more radical tax reform. Right now the Republican Party and the nation are split over which system would be better: a single flat-rate income tax or a national sales tax that replaces the income tax altogether. And after tax hikes in 1990 and 1993, a majority of taxpayers seem unwilling to give up large deductions for mortgages, charitable contributions, and state and local taxes in return for yet another politician's promise. Once the White House is returned to safe hands, presumably with a Republican Congress, there'll be plenty of time to thrash out the most workable plan.
<P>
Meanwhile, income-tax cuts will keep the focus on the individual. Right now the biggest tax burdens hit individuals, not businesses. The GOP is too quick to emphasize full depreciation expensing, or eliminating the capital-gains tax altogether, and not quick enough to address the combined burden of high payroll- and income-tax rates. On capital gains, for now, indexing would be just fine. But as Reagan understood full well, cutting income taxes is a populist issue, whereas cutting business taxes looks like and often is an elitist approach.
<P>
In Washington today economists are beginning to sense the middle-class public's growing desire for expanded economic growth. Thanks to back-to-back large-scale tax hikes in 1990 and 1993, this recovery cycle has produced yearly growth of less than 3 per cent, compared to a normal rate of better than 4 per cent. As a result, the nation has forgone nearly $2 trillion in income and nearly 6 million jobs.
<P>
But the solution is not to force the Federal Reserve into inflating the money supply. Already this year, fears of inflation have driven up interest rates. Investors are worried that government policies will shift toward easy money rather than tax cuts, lower budget spending, and deregulation. 
<P>
The Dole campaign should learn something else from Reagan's policy notebook: Inflation is caused by too much money chasing too few goods, not by growth. If across-the-board income-tax-rate cuts, along with higher-bracket thresholds, freshen economic growth incentives to produce more goods and services, then the larger volume of output would render the existing money supply <I>less</I> inflationary. Of course, when Paul Krugman and Larry Summers briefly worked on the staff of the Council of Economic Advisors during Reagan's first term, they argued that tax cuts would increase inflation. They were dead wrong. Smart men, wrong theory. Reagan had the story right. Now, Dole must draw from Reagan, not the Washington economic establishment.
<P>
The populist approach resonates with voters. It worked for Reagan, Whitman, Engler, Thompson, Symington, and Pataki, and it will work for Dole. Real simple: He raised them, I'm going to cut them. Across the board. For everyone. I led the fight in 1993, losing by only a few votes. Please give me a chance to finish the fight and win the war. People will spend their money more wisely than government will. The economy can grow by 3 per cent or more, with a steady dollar and no inflation. And folks will be freer to set their own moral standards in communities across the nation. I am optimistic about the ability of individual men and women to make our nation grow and prosper, and to supply jobs, income, and financial power well into the next century.
<P>
PS.: The stock market will signal that this is a political winner well before the November election is held.

Dear Rusty,
<P>


As hard as I try, I can't seem to shake this feeling that we're headed for certain victory in November.
<P>
I'm trying not to be too cocky. I remember well the days in 1988 when The New Republic endorsed my bid for the Presidency, and I thought to myself, ``Hey, TNR is about as in touch as you can get. If they like me, then everybody likes me.'' So, obviously, I'm keeping a lid on the counting-chickens department. 
<P>
Still, it's nice to have a comfortable lead. We had originally planned to spend the spring and early summer with a kind of ``Plan A'' and ``Plan B'' approach -- ``Plan A'' being a lot of appearances by me on Brinkley, CNN, and Meet the Press reaffirming my complete faith in the integrity and honesty of Bill and HRC irrespective of the
grand-jury indictments; and ``Plan B'' being Tipper's hunger strike outside the Little Rock jailhouse until they released HRC and waived bail. 
<P>
But, as things turned out, we didn't need either plan, so now, with three months to go before the convention and $22 million to spend, we're kind of looking at each other and thinking, ``Now what?''
<P> 
So when Chris Dodd, one of Connecticut's senators, and the chairman of the party's Senate campaign, gave me a call last week, I took the bull by the horns. ``Chris,'' I said, ``you and I both know that victory in November is a foregone conclusion. But I've always thought that it's important to plan the move after the next move. So what do you and Tom have on the agenda come January 1997?''
<P> 
``Me and who?'' Chris asked.
<P> 
``Tom Daschle,'' I said. ``Senate Minority Leader, and, after November, the Majority Leader.''
<P> 
``Oh. Right. Tom. Tom,'' Chris said. ``Tom's a super guy. I just love him to death, don't you?''
<P> 
``I'm fond of him, sure,'' I said.
<P> 
``He's a great little soldier; loyal, steadfast, maybe not the most visionary guy, but hey, that's not what we need in a Minority Leader, is it?''
<P> 
I was getting a little impatient. ``Yes,'' I said, ``there's something to that, but Chris -- ''
<P> 
``But a majority leader -- whoa. That's a
different-type cat altogether, no?''
<P> 
``Chris,'' I said, ``I'd love to chat all day with you, but I've got a meeting in a few minutes, and I really want to talk about the future, okay?''
<P> 
``Mr. Vice President, that's all I think about.'' 
<P>
And with that, he dashed off to a floor vote, after promising to call me back. In the meantime, I dialed Dick Gephardt's office.
<P> 
``Speaker Gephardt's office,'' a voice answered.
<P> 
"Is Dick in?'' I asked, after identifying myself.
<P> 
``Please hold.'' 
Which I did. For almost twenty minutes. You know me, Rusty. I'm not a stickler for protocol. And I wasn't personally insulted to be kept on hold, I was insulted for the office of the Vice Presidency. Look, I know that Dick and I haven't always gotten along -- heck, we both wanted our party's nomination in 1988, and while some people have characterized him as a half-witted knee-jerk big-government-liberal lightbulb-faced albino, I've always admired his keen legislative skill. 
<P>
So when Dick finally got on the phone with a cheery ``How 'ya doing, Al?'' I let the jarring breach of protocol pass -- I'm usually called ``Mr. Vice President,'' after all.
<P>
``I'm fine, Dick. How are you?''
<P>
``Doing pretty well for a guy who's 'so far left, he's left America.'''
<P>

<H2>Are the Germans Guilty?
</H2> </CENTER>

<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, APRIL 16
<P>
The new book that insists that the vast majority of the German people were exterminationist in word and deed (the title of Daniel Jonah Goldhagen's book is Hitler's Willing Executioners) is more merely than historically depressing. It is bad enough to be asked to believe that the huge majority of the German people were aware of Hitler's enterprise. It is horrifying to meditate on the question: How safe is it to assume, if that were so in 1938 - 45, that its equivalent isn't reposing in the minds and hearts of other cultures right now?
<P>
Professor Goldhagen's thesis will be disputed by other scholars, given that he is not everywhere furrowing fresh historical ground. His thesis is that the anti-Semitism of the Germans was so deeply rooted that they had no problem at all in going from what he calls the ``eliminationist'' stage (let us get rid of the Jews) to the ``exterminationist'' stage (let us get rid of them by slaughter).
<P>
There are, to say the least, some very rough edges in Mr. Goldhagen's thesis, among them that in describing the indifference to slaughter evidenced by the Germans when they conquered Poland he seems to be talking about an undifferentiated impulse to slaughter. It didn't seem to matter whether the victims were Jewish or non-Jewish, any more than it seemed to matter what was the attachment, religious or ethnic, of the hundreds of thousands (millions?) of East Europeans and Ukrainians murdered at both ends of the German invasion of the Soviet Union. If an entire population is inflamed with the lust to kill, how much does it matter who the victims are, except to those who wish to come up with a vague schematic handle for justifying an antagonism? At an academic level, researchers have written about those terrible years without concluding that the German people were empathic collaborators, let alone participants in genocide. At a personal level I am a friend of a German expatriate (he left Germany twenty years after Hitler) who even as a boy was given to sharing his father's necessarily concealed hatred of the Fuhrer. My friend's trade (in retail) keeps him in common touch and he reports -- frighteningly -- that he has encountered more anti-Semitism in America than ever he did in Germany. If this is so or even nearly so we have reason to question the most basic claims of civilization.
<P> 
It is a haunting question, and reduces to microcosmic measure. Mr. Goldhagen would have us believe that many, perhaps even a majority, of those killed in the years he writes about were killed by single bullets. Science came along with the extermination process, which could take care of hundreds at a time. But the support system even for extermination camps was extensive, hundreds and thousands of executioners, suppliers of lethal materials, barbed-wire manufacturers and installers.
<P>
But how widely was news of the enterprise known? The evidence is everywhere sobering. When Mao Tse-tung promulgated his Cultural Revolution he was able to count on the approving roar of the mob, which included sons and daughters of those proclaimed to be enemies of the people and therefore fit to die. In Cambodia they did have machine guns, but they did not depend on weapons of corporate death: there were enough individual peasant soldiers willing to kill one and one-half million of their brothers and sisters. In Rwanda - Burundi we think of tribal antagonism as generating the impulse to the killing of a half-million, but what is it that causes that tribal antagonism to go to genocidal extremes? Why does the Serb so despise the Muslim as to go to lengths one would never suppose a California Anglo would go to against a Hispanic?
<P>
Few of us have reviewed inflammatory anti-Semitic literature published in Germany during the twenty years before the Holocaust. But of course it exists, Hitler's own manifesto being of primary importance. There is anti-black (and anti-white) material published in America. We are all absolutely fatalistic about, if not acclimated to, episodic violence traceable to race and religion, but it is incomprehensible, if not inconceivable, that the kind of thing we have could develop into genocide. 
<P>
We have a considerable stake in hoping that Professor Goldhagen has himself committed sociological genocide. You cannot exaggerate the terrible implications of ethnic hostility. But if it is true that almost the entire German population actively contributed to what happened in mid-century, then no minority, anywhere, is safe.

Despite an all-out effort on his behalf by the Republican establishment, incumbent Rep. Greg Laughlin, a former Democrat, lost a primary runoff to Ron Paul in Texas's 14th District. Democrats hope that Laughlin's defeat will discourage other officeholders from defecting to the GOP (205 have done so since Bill Clinton's election). But in ex-Congressman Ron Paul, the Libertarian Party candidate for President in 1988, Laughlin faced a tough, well-known, and more conservative opponent. Laughlin is the least conservative congressional Democrat to switch parties so far; he has an anemic 58 lifetime rating from the American Conservative Union, and his voting record proved more important to voters in this conservative district than his spanking new party label. So Mr. Laughlin's failure to make a convincing conversion is unlikely to dissuade desirable conservative Democrats from fleeing across the aisle. Democrats might even the score by tempting undesirable liberal Republicans to join their ranks. NR would happily provide the names of Republicans who have shown every sign they'd rather switch than fight.

Economic conservatives are right to like free trade. Pat Buchanan's conservatives-with-a-heart are right to worry about its impact on vulnerable Americans. In our last issue, David Frum proposed a sensible compromise (``Living with Nationalism,'' p. 22) that answers both concerns: stop mass unskilled immigration. Current mass immigration is virtually worthless to Americans in aggregate, causes serious displacement of native-born workers, and is not at all logically linked to economic growth. Current economic research supports Frum's political case. For example, an article in the May 1996 American Economic Review by George Borjas, Richard Freeman, and Larry Katz estimates that 30 to 40 per cent of the recent widening of the wage gap between skilled and unskilled workers is due to trade and immigration -- but that immigration is perhaps twice as significant as trade in the calculation. Helping the unskilled begins abroad -- by keeping the foreign unskilled there.

At least one factor in GOP's 1994 sweep is gone, never to return: the complacency of the other side. The AFL-CIO last month approved a special 15-cent-a-month assessment on its members to help fund a $35-million anti-Republican blitzkrieg this fall. For a foretaste of hypercharged union political activity, consider the special election to fill Bob Packwood's Senate seat last January, where a union field staff of forty, large-scale mailings, and massive independent expenditures on advertising tipped the race to liberal Ron Wyden. Labor -- and the feminists and environmentalists -- are ready to fight to the death to preserve their threatened federal status quo. Unless the Right creates a countervailing sense of urgency -- the kind it mustered when opposing President Clinton's tax increases and health plans -- it will be bulldozed right back into righteous opposition. Talking up ``divisive'' issues like tax cuts, affirmative action, immigration, and crime would be a first step. If Republicans feel guilty about hitting the hot buttons, soon-to-air AFL-CIO attack ads will be just the thing to help them get over it.

It used to be a scarlet letter A. Today it's V, for Votetally. Those rankings, by the National Taxpayers Union Foundation, of congressional voting patterns seem to carry quite a stigma for sinners. Consider the shift in voting patterns uncovered in the latest NTU report: The ten congressmen ranked by Votetally as the biggest spenders of 1994 changed course dramatically in 1995; their rankings dropped by an average of 136. The second ten dropped by 76; the third by 72. All in all, declines occurred throughout the top third of the 1994 distribution -- a remarkable shift given the institutionally controlled nature of congressional floor votes. Members, chastened by that V on their foreheads, got religion. So why didn't more of the Contract pass? Look waaaay down at the bottom, at the most conservative penny-pinchers of 1994. They moved up by an average of 91 places in the 1995 rankings. The backsliding, NTU says, ``may reflect an attitude of complacency among those who thought they had done well in the [1994] study.'' A misapprehension, dispelled by the latest report, not to mention by the status of the Republican agenda.

In the aftermath of Oklahoma City, we discouraged our brethren in the media (to little effect) from portraying Timothy McVeigh as a man of the Right -- an only slightly more deranged cousin of Rush and Newt. With the arrest of Theodore Kaczynski, the suspected Unabomber, we similarly resist the temptation to link him to Kirkpatrick Sale or Al Gore. As David Gelernter, one of the bomber's victims and an NR contributing editor, wrote in Time: ``The tendency among some intellectuals and journalists to dignify with analysis the thinking of violent criminals has always struck me as low and contemptible. I couldn't care less what the man's views on technology are or what message he intended to deliver; the message I got was that in any society, no matter how rich, just, and free, you can rely on there being a certain number of evil cowards. I thank him for passing it along, but I knew that anyway.''

New York Gov. George Pataki has vowed to lead the fight against the Republican platform's pro-life plank in San Diego. He believes the issue has ``hurt the Republican Party'' and says, ``I think it is important that we make it plain that being against abortion is not the position of the Republican Party.'' This arguably places Gov. Pataki to the left, on this issue, of his predecessor, Mario Cuomo, who at least always maintained he was ``personally opposed.'' For the record, we would favor maintaining the anti-abortion stance even if it cost the party votes. But there is no credible evidence that it does. Polls show that among single-issue voters, pro-lifers outnumber pro-choicers by roughly 2 to 1. Pro-lifers would win any fair intra-party debate on the issue. But San Diego is not the proper place for one: it would turn into a circus ring-mastered not by Republicans but by the media. To fend off that possibility, Gov. Pataki's mentor, Sen. Al D'Amato, who claims to be pro-life, and Bob Dole, whose campaign D'Amato co-chairs, should point out to the governor the political obtuseness of his new position. While they're at it, they should keep an eye on Governors Weld and Whitman, who are also spoiling for a San Diego fight. By supporting President Clinton's veto of the partial-birth-abortion ban, these governors have shown that they are the spokesmen not for a major wing of the GOP, but for an extremist fringe. (Only 15 House Republicans voted against the ban.) Party leaders -- and journalists -- should treat them accordingly.

Even as Congress moved crabwise toward mild but welcome measures against illegal immigration, an incident in Southern California in which police chased and finally stopped a pickup truck carrying 23 illegals made the case for even sterner moves. Though everyone by now has probably seen the videotape of two white police officers beating two illegals while the other illegals fled into the bush, the issue is not really one of ``police brutality,'' much less ``racism.'' The truck had penetrated our porous border and led the police on a wild chase at 100 mph while its occupants flung garbage and metal objects at the pursuers. The videotape records 15 seconds. The chase lasted an hour. The driver of the truck is suing for $10 million, and might get it from the right jury. The fleeing illegals, no kidding, now have six-month residency permits. Thanks to the mass media's bias on immigration, the case has become a second Mylai. The ACLU has seized the opportunity to call for more affirmative-action quotas in police departments. But to most callers to California talk shows, and NR, these police officers are not villains but overworked and decent cops who were pushed too far. Their sins are trivial compared to their defense of their country and its laws.

NR has never before endorsed candidates in Italy. But if the Center - Right wins the national election on April 21, a contender for the premiership could well be Antonio Martino, former foreign minister, first-rate economist, and occasional contributor to NR. Italy's electoral system forces politicians, Left and Right, to form broad coalitions. The leftists, led by the renamed Communist Party, stand for continuing the old system of welfare and patronage for big business. The Right's most dynamic component is the southern-based National Alliance. Its leader, Gianfranco Fini, is the country's most popular politician, but he is simply too controversial for the premiership. No one expects that the Right's nominal leader, media magnate Silvio Berlusconi, distracted by legal attacks on his media empire and allegations of tax evasion, would be more effective in a new stint as premier than he was in 1994. So, as the most effective spokesman for tax cuts and economic liberalization, Martino could well be the respectable compromise candidate for prime minister. If he won, Italy would instantly become the intellectual leader at gatherings of the G-7 group of heads of state of the industrialized world.

In response to a wave of rocket attacks launched by Hezbollah from Lebanon, Israel retaliated -- and upped the ante. Israel's troops swept into southern Lebanon to expand the buffer zone, and its planes and gunships destroyed sites in Beirut belonging to Hezbollah and other radical groups. It was the first big Israeli operation in Beirut since the early 1980s. The real culprit here is Syria, which sees periodically giving Hezbollah free rein as a cost-free way of pressuring the Israelis. By humiliating Lebanon (Syria's puppet), the Israelis have demonstrated that it's not so cost-free. With the May election coming, Shimon Peres could do no less.

The first thing to say about seven-year-old Jessica Dubroff is that she was not a pilot. Nine years short of the minimum legal age to solo an airplane -- or for that matter to drive a car -- she was a passenger whom an indulgent flight instructor and father had permitted to manipulate controls so that she might appear to break some dubious record for youngsters flying cross-country. Reportedly, Jessica had recently been reading Hillary Clinton's It Takes a Village. In her case, a village might have done a better job of raising her than her two earnest, New Age parents. Her mother, Lisa Blair Hathaway, said she raised her children to be people of ``freedom and choice.'' She seems to have assigned absolute worth to these ideals without recognizing that they are prerogatives of adults who have taken life's buffetings; they must be earned. ``Children are fearless,'' she said. ``That's their natural state until adults ingrain fear in them.'' True enough. But she neglected the responsibility of parents to ingrain proper fear; an ordinate sense of one's limitations in the face of the world's dangers defines the mature mind. Miss Hathaway remembers Jessica as a little girl who had lived ``a full, wonderful, wonderful, exquisite life.'' It should have been a much longer one.

A weighty tome (417 pages) issued by the National Research Council deserves a lot more attention than it has gotten. Produced by a panel of twenty scientists, the report thoroughly debunks the ``natural is healthier'' theme that is in such vogue among regulators, activists, and elites generally. The report finds no basis for the notion that synthetic additives, pesticide residues, and byproducts of manufacturing are a significant cancer risk. On the contrary: ``It is the naturally occurring compounds in our diet, together with excess fat and calories, that have the greatest effect on cancer causation.'' The panel found ``no notable biological differences between synthetic and naturally occurring carcinogens.'' But because of the much greater quantity of natural carcinogens in the diet -- in cooked meats, cereals, spreads, fruits, vegetables -- they deserve the most attention. Seventy common, naturally occurring chemical constituents of food have both cancer-causing and cancer-fighting properties under different conditions and at different concentrations; disease defies simple notions of good and bad. Since most environmentalist health scares -- as well as the parallel illusion of the healthiness of the ``natural'' -- trace their ancestry to Rachel Carson's Silent Spring, Dr. William M. London, in Priorities, the journal of the American Council on Science and Health, has suggested that such alarms be dubbed ``Carsonogenic.''

The California State Supreme Court has delivered itself of a theological finding. Mrs. Evelyn Smith, a Presbyterian landlady, has been sued by a man and a woman who wished to live together and who had at first lied about their marital status. When Mrs. Smith discovered that the couple was not, in fact, married, she said her religion would not permit her to rent them an apartment. The court ruled that Mrs. Smith had violated the couple's right to ``freedom from discrimination based on personal characteristics.'' No mention of Mrs. Smith's right not to be morally affronted in her own home. Marian Johnston, triumphant attorney for the unmarried pair (who have since split up), offered an illuminating interpretation of the decision: ``We're not precluding [Mrs. Smith] from exercising her religion. We're just saying she can't bring it with her into the business world.'' In the opinion of the highest court in the nation's largest state, religion must be reduced to an emasculated cultural habit with no relevance to the actual conduct of people's lives. We don't care what you believe, so long as it's nothing.

<I>Malaise and infighting are threatening
the future of the conservative movement.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT>HIS has been a winter of discontent for conservatives, one that left the high spirits of 1995 a frustrating memory. Budget defeats and infighting in the primaries have left them still more demoralized. Republicans in Congress fear taking on powerful but controversial issues such as official English and affirmative action. They ascribe to Bill Clinton and Dick Morris mythic powers of winning the public-relations battles that would ensue. And in some cases their defeatism extends to predictions that the GOP will lose its majority in the Congress.
<P>
At the grassroots, the Left is more energized than the Right for the elections. ``You can practically feel the malaise,'' says Amy Moritz, head of the National Center for Public Policy Research.
<P>
This mood is in part a byproduct of the political season, the dog-days between the primaries and the general-election campaign. Grover Norquist, the jovial strategist, argues that ever since ``the adrenalin rush in the first hundred days,'' conservatives have had been marking time. They should use the lull, he says, to build up their grass-roots organisations rather than grousing. 
<P>
Then, too, Beltway conservatives are still adjusting to majority status. Unrealistic expectations of a ``revolution'' after the 1994 elections set them up for disillusionment. A thin majority in the House and merely nominal control of the Senate ought to have led them to build the case for expanding their majorities by giving the public a preview of the tangible benefits they could expect from conservative governance. Instead they tried to govern immediately, believing that their triumph was historically inevitable and permanent. When Clinton declined to roll over as expected, says Michael Horowitz of the Hudson Institute, ``Many conservatives, particularly the younger ones, discovered to their shock that the other side can shoot real bullets.'' As a result, the Congress has so far delivered for only one group: speed demons made happy by the repeal of the federal speed limit.
<P>
And those early defeats have made them gun-shy. Where they once had over-ambitious goals, they are now nervous of having any goals at all. Their inability to devise a sequel to the Contract with America that would command broad support from lawmakers is an ominous indicator of the present mood. ``If you don't have a goal, you won't have morale,'' says Miss Moritz. ``And we haven't had a goal other than taking Newt's orders for fifteen months.''
<P>
But if specific mistakes and the constraint of having Clinton in the White House were wholly responsible for the current malaise, conservatives could be optimistic. But they have a deeper anxiety: is their coalition cracking up, its internal disagreements no longer submerged by a common desire to topple the mighty empire of Liberaldom? Even on an issue as central as taxes, conservatives have not reached a consensus. After two years of debate, supply-siders still see the tax credit for children as a sop to the Christian Coalition, and social conservatives still see the capital-gains tax cut as a sop to Wall Street. In this and other debates, different sorts of conservatives are too often walled up in their respective ghettoes.
<P>
When they're not hurling incendiary charges at each other. Charges of racism and nativism, for instance, have been bandied about freely, and other charges typically used by liberals to smear conservatives en masse have been brought into intra-family debates. Such conduct ftyhr tjos jave jadee beem [be has provided grist for liberals' mills and eroded the collegiality that used to exist on the Right.
<P>
And as conservatives fought these Beltway battles, they were losing touch with the concerns of conservative voters in the boondocks. The two candidates who won the most votes, Dole and Pat Buchanan, were the very ones most disliked by the conservative intelligentsia. Conservatives were, at best, irrelevant to the presidential race. Yet they have been remarkably disinclined to reflect on their role in the debacle.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>F</FONT>OR debacle it was -- and, moreover, an unnecessary one. In 1988, the three conservative candidates won about a third of the primary votes; this time around, economic and social conservatives combined were pulling much closer to 50 per cent. The conditions were there for a united conservative coalition to win the nomination and the election. While it's too early to know how a Dole Administration would turn out, it's not too early for recriminations.
<P>
On paper the choice was an easy one: either make a conservative case for the front-runner, or coalesce around a candidate capable of stopping him. A thin slice of the conservative intelligentsia settled for Bob Dole early. The rest played with weak candidates or non-candidates. A number of prominent conservatives, many of them clustered around The Weekly Standard, flirted with Colin Powell and Newt Gingrich -- helping Dole freeze out his actual competition for crucial months. (By the time they moved to the Lamar Alexander camp, their influence in these matters had worn thin.) Other conservative notables such as Norquist and Paul Weyrich adopted an airy nonchalance about the outcome; some even suggested that it might not matter if Republicans won the White House so long as they held Congress.
<P>
And in the absence of a unifying candidate, the Reagan coalition split, with economic conservatives backing Steve Forbes and social conservatives going to Buchanan. The Forbes campaign was an attempt by the libertarian minority of the coalition to overpower the traditionalist majority through the sheer force of money and the support of a portion of the conservative elite (the Wall Street Journal's editorial page and The American Spectator blew kisses toward Forbes on a regular basis). The effort backfired, magnifying the influence of Buchanan, the least pro-market candidate, in early primaries.
<P>
Few conservative leaders backed Buchanan (though Gary Bauer, Phyllis Schlafly, Human Events, and others indulged his departures from free-market orthodoxy). But the Beltway Right inadvertently helped Buchanan to exploit fissures in the coalition by blithely ignoring the sentiments of social conservatives. A steady drumbeat from D.C. had signaled that social issues, notably abortion, had to be pushed to the back-burner. Washington conservatives' blind spot on the familial and moral principles that animate the grassroots caused them to underestimate Buchanan's political potential.
<P>
The upshot: social and economic conservatives signed a suicide pact. Not only did conservatives fail to control the nomination, they marginalized themselves as well. A fifth of primary voters listed taxation as their most important issue. An impressive plurality (39 per cent) of them backed Forbes even as he was soundedly defeated (with 12 per cent of the vote). Arguably, the effect of his campaign was to set back the cause of tax reform. Buchanan, meanwhile, did even better among dedicated pro-lifers than Forbes did among anti-taxers. When he was going strong, Buchanan simply isolated religious conservatives from the rest of the party. In the end, the man who won the primaries owes very little to either economic or social conservatives; except for Ralph Reed and Pat Robertson, they've mainly given him trouble.
<P>
Phil Gramm deserves a good portion of the blame for this debacle. In many ways the logical candidate of the coalition, he apparently assumed he was therefore its inevitable candidate. (In this respect, his campaign was eerily reminiscent of Kemp's in 1988.) Dole, ironically, did a better job of courting it. Gramm might have recovered from his early errors in a longer campaign. But although everyone talked about the speed of the primary process this year, nobody was really prepared for it. Even NR, which did the right thing in endorsing Phil Gramm, did so too late to do any good -- and that was before Iowa, let alone New Hampshire.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>C</FONT>ONSERVATIVES overestimated their power in the nominating process for the same reason Gramm erred. They confused electoral victories for conservative candidates over the last three decades with a deep and systematic belief in conservative ideas on the part of the voters. The conservative ``movement'' exists in the minds of a fairly small number of people; many who march with it have no deep understanding of its principles. (Nor, apparently, do its pundits.) While there may be an inchoate conservative majority in the country, it's not there just for the asking. That majority has to be continually converted, recruited, and given rousing song sheets. 
<P>
Conservatives ought to ponder the possibility that their current difficulties are symptomatic of an underlying disease, one whose debilitating effects may last beyond November regardless of the election results. Richard Vigilante saw the danger as early as 1985. Writing in NR's 30th anniversary issue, he warned that the conservative enterprise had become ``too large and too busy for philosophical reflection. If it does not find, or is not given, a clear, simple sense of what holds it together, it will split apart, ruptured by confusion and opportunism.'' Conservatives are not receiving that kind of intellectual sustenance, and are therefore increasingly adrift.
<P>
If conservatives are on intellectual autopilot, much of the explanation may lie in the culture of that network of thinkers, writers, and activists, (too) largely located in Washington and New York, whom one might designate collectively as ``conservative opinion leaders.'' They are, in short, an elite -- and they act like one. Too many conservatives are operating on a stale and derivative, even if largely accurate, orthodoxy. If popular concerns fit into that orthodoxy -- for instance, anti-tax sentiment -- they can respond readily enough, and win votes by doing so. Other anxieties -- notably, over the nation's cultural fragmentation -- just pass under their radar screen.
<P>
But the Right's strength since the Fifties has largely been built by diagnosing the grievances and anxieties of ordinary Americans and responding to them with real remedies. It is now losing touch with its base and its potential support. Thus conservatives are constantly being caught off guard by swings in the popular mood. (A case in point: the panic over ``worker anxiety'' after Pat Buchanan's showing in New Hampshire.) On occasion they have even tried to suppress discussion of the public's cultural anxieties. Instead of asking why so many grassroots conservatives opposed NAFTA, for instance, the Beltway elite simply told them they were being paranoid. A political movement in touch with its supporters can tell them when they're wrong; it can't tell them that they're not worried.
<P>
One Reaganite, herself a Beltway insider, decries ``the pernicious influence of the think-tank approach to life and politics. In the Seventies and Eighties, they did a terrific job of giving policy articulation to inchoate political resentments. But the policy articulation has now floated free of the political ground from which it originally sprang.'' The think tanks tend to reduce politics to a set of discrete policy areas without providing an overarching philosophy to link them.
<P>
Worse, conservative intellectuals seem unable to distinguish between their role and that of conservative politicians. They take care to keep their arguments safely within the confines of the politically ``possible'' while perhaps seeking to nudge those boundaries rightward. ``Too many people are writing op-eds which picture them in the campaign bull session or in the committee mark-up room,'' complains Lawrence Kudlow. As a result of this sort of positioning, conservative leaders lose sight both of first principles and of their own social base.
<P>
Meanwhile, the occasional mention on the Style page has gone to some of their heads. The immersion of many conservatives in the celebrity culture -- and particularly their willingness to caricature their ideas in order to make them sellable on television -- has been corrupting. With some honorable exceptions, they entertain viewers with their political movement and in the process are domesticated and rendered ineffectual. Blurring the line between politics and entertainment tends to make conservatives -- especially those in the Beltway -- seem cynical and frivolous.
<P>
Indeed, fin-de-siccle conservatism is increasingly concerned with matters of style, straining to make itself appear fashionable. Conservative chic often accompanies a tiresome triumphalism. The implication, notes Kudlow, is that ``we've won, we're cool, and you better join us'' -- as if the goal of conservatives were to replicate the smugness of a liberal Georgetown cocktail party. The result is not so much moral compromise, though it is sometimes that, as the political myopia that was evident during the primaries.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>G</FONT>IFTED and principled political leadership would go far to cure the conservative malaise. But no one since Reagan has emerged to provide a focal point for conservatives. Jack Kemp and Bill Bennett, icons to almost all conservatives just a few years ago, lacked the stomach to audition for the role. Instead, they have gone out of their way to annoy other conservatives; their remaining influence derives mostly from good press. Newt Gingrich, for his part, has proved unable to lead congressional Republicans and the conservative coalition simultaneously in the face of a hostile press. By default, then, Rush Limbaugh is the most visible conservative on the national scene. He is a force for common sense, but, wisely, he has declined to play a role for which he is not suited.
<P>
Conservatives cannot afford to wait for another Reagan to come along. Former NR publisher William Rusher says, ``I share the nostalgia. But the Lord does not always provide you with Ronald Reagans. We were badly spoiled and sometimes you have to do without.'' It is especially unbecoming for conservatives to complain that Bob Dole dispirits them when their own fecklessness did so much to ensure his nomination. One thoughtful observer of the Beltway Right expresses exasperation with the current conservative mood: ``All these people who are lamenting that we don't have a Reagan are betraying his legacy, which was a can-do spirit. If he were at these meetings he'd be asking how we could aggressively push forward, not kvetching that there's no Reagan.''
<P>
If Bob Dole is elected, it will make a difference whether the dominant faction of the party he leads is rudderless and confused, or vigorous and clear-headed. Tom Pauken, chairman of the Texas Republican Party, warns that if economic and social conservatives do not form a successful governing coalition in the next few years, ``You're going to see the splintering of our movement, you'll see conservatives start leaving the Republican Party, you'll see third- and fourth-party movements, you'll see a phenomenon in which people after a while just kind of bail out of the whole political system.''
<P>
Or conservatives could use the Dole interregnum to regroup, developing a higher degree of ideological self-consciousness and becoming accustomed to the political discipline of governing. They must simultaneously hold the conservative coalition together; keep the GOP anchored within a conservative, antistatist consensus while tackling new cultural and economic anxieties. A movement beset by inertia will be unable to accomplish any of these tasks. So far, however, conservatives don't seem to grasp that there's a problem.

Dear Rusty,
<P>
I have to be honest with you. Your last letter disturbed me. I don't think it was fair to call us ``too cocky by half.'' It just so happens that the American people are happy with what we've done and are eager to have us do more of it.
<P>
I could quote poll numbers and cite focus-group findings all day. But the truth is, we're going to win because we have a secret plan.
<P>
Okay, it's not a completely secret plan. I mean, I'm authorized to tell a few people. Tipper, for one, and you, and Joe Klein makes three . . . 
<P>
Here it is: for the next six months or so, Bill, HRC, Tipper, and I are pretty much going to live in California full time. Bill's taken a suite at the Sheraton Miramar in Santa Monica, Tip and I are looking at property up north, in Marin County, and HRC is going to kind of divide her time between San Diego and the Central Coast.
<P>
I wasn't sure about it at first. But Tipper convinced me.
<P>
``I don't know, Tip,'' I said. ``Won't the people in California see right through us?'' 
<P>
``What are you talking about?'' she asked. ``And don't stop packing.'' 
<P>
``Well,'' I said, ``we've already ordered more B-1 bombers, we're talking about cracking down on illegal immigration, and now we're all going to move to the state and pretend it's all a coincidence?'' 
<P>
Tipper held a ``Heal the Bay'' T-shirt against me. ``Does this still fit?'' she asked. It did, so she tossed it into the duffel bag. 
<P>
``Look, Al,'' she said. ``What I know is we start with an electoral-vote deficit of about one hundred. And California has over half that.'' 
<P>
``Yes, but how dumb do you think the people in California are?'' 
<P>
``Um . . . If you lived in an area that periodically suffered devastating, property-destroying brush fires, would you keep rebuilding million-dollar houses there?''
<P>
``No.''
<P>
``Okay. Say you had a nice house on the beach. But every year, violent storms would wash it away, leaving you with nothing but a pile of driftwood and some sandbags. Would you, A) move; or B) build a new house in the same place?''
<P>
``A?'' 
<P>
``Good. Now say that you lived in an area in which, periodically, the earth shook violently for several seconds, leveling houses, freeways, bridges, destroying property, and killing people. What would you do?''
<P>
``Gosh, I'd move.'' 
<P>
``But what if you didn't?'' 
<P>
``Why wouldn't I? What am I, stupid?'' 
<P>
And then the light bulb went off above my head. I smiled at Tipper. 
<P>
I called Dad that afternoon to tell him the news. 
<P>
``Dad, Tipper and I are going to live in California for a while.'' 
<P>
``Wait a sec,'' he said. I could hear him picking up his highball. I could hear the ice tinkling in the glass as he sipped. 
<P>
``Is it November already? Did you guys lose?'' 
<P>
``No, Dad,'' I said as patiently as I could. ``We're just going out -- '' 
<P>
``Don't tell me. It's a must-win state and you're going to spread a little money around?'' 
<P>
``Well, I might quibble with your gloss, but -- ''
<P>
``Kiddo, let me give you a piece of advice. Wait a sec.'' I heard him pick up his highball, wipe the sweat off the glass, then take a big sip. ``Kiddo,'' he said, ``do you really think you're going to be able to make sense out of that state? They're the people who gave us Ronald Reagan and Jerry Brown in the same year! They put shrimp on their pizza! They hire illegal aliens for a buck an hour to do the cleaning and the gardening and the odd-jobs around the house and then they complain that the illegals are ruining the state! The last time we Southerners had a deal like that we went to war to keep it!'' 
<P>
``Dad -- '' 
<P>
``And they keep building their damn houses on fault lines or tinder boxes or storm fronts.'' 
<P>
``Dad -- '' 
<P>
``You'll go out there, spread the money around, order some bombers and a missile-defense system or two, build more freeways, and do you know what those lunatics out there will do? They'll vote for the Libertarian -- or worse: they'll vote for that funny-looking guy with the big ears.'' 
<P>
``Prince Charles?'' 
<P>
``No! Then again, maybe -- they're weird out there.'' 
<P>
And with that, Dad hung up. Or maybe he put his drink down on the phone, I'm not sure. 
<P>
The point is, Rusty, we have a plan. Gotta go reset my watch!

<H2>Colin Powell, VP
</H2> </CENTER>

<HR>
<P>
NEW YORK, MARCH 29
<P>
Concerning the proposal: Colin Powell for Vice President, a few observations:
<P>
1. The primary qualification for a vice-presidential selection is: Will he substantially enhance the probability of the election of the presidential candidate?
<P>
On the matter of General Powell, the answer to that question, at this reading, is Yes. In fact, his name conjoined to that of Bob Dole makes up the only slate that would defeat Clinton - Gore. Granted, the popularity of General Powell would almost certainly diminish soon after he began to campaign. In part his high prestige rests on his reputation as an Olympian figure, undefiled by politics.
<P>
It was so with General Eisenhower in 1952. The New Leader magazine illustrated the sharp turn in public opinion the week after Eisenhower's first political address in his home state. The headline was ``IKE STOPPED AT ABILENE.'' It is not even safe to assume that Powell would sweep the black vote. The last estimate on this question, in October, was that he would carry 30 per cent of black Americans. But that is a critical swing, given that 95 per cent have gone Democratic over the years. And, true, the fact of a black on the national ticket would turn some white voters away. The awful social/ethnic division highlighted by the reaction to the O. J. Simpson verdict instructs us that there is a body of Americans not yet prepared to vote for a black candidate. As much is probably true of a Jewish candidate; as much was certainly true of a Catholic candidate up until JFK. 
<P>
2. The ideological objections to General Powell as Vice President are of an entirely different order from what they'd have been if he were running for President. A presidential candidate's position on such high-ignition questions as abortion and affirmative action matters substantially. The voters are asked to express their choice both politically and symbolically. If Bob Dole were flat-out in favor of abortion he would not win, either the nomination or the election. 
<P>
It is another thing when it is a vice-presidential candidate being considered. For one thing, by accepting the nomination, the vice-presidential candidate subordinates his position on divisive issues, deferring to the presidential candidate. It is simply inconceivable that nominee Powell could tour the country during the fall taking issue with Dole's position on abortion or for that matter any other important political question. The last time that happened was Andrew Jackson - John C. Calhoun. If the voter were deciding whom to vote for on the assumption that Dole would die or retire, it is hardly probable that on being sworn in, President Powell would reverse his predecessor's position on abortion. 
<P>
On the question of affirmative action, the Republican delegates in San Diego are going to realize that the direction the debate will take depends on two factors. The first is how the plebiscite that would forbid affirmative action fares in California. The second is how the Supreme Court, which is narrowly divided on the issue, swings. Affirmative action is an empirical failure and a philosophical disaster. Its destiny is not in the hands of the Republican nominee for Vice President. 
<P>
3. On the matter of Powell's designating himself as a ``Rockefeller Republican'' we are constrained to ask two questions. The first is, Did it substantially damage Gerald Ford when he named Rockefeller as Vice President in 1974? Evidence is not abundant that the selection was an abomination among Republicans of the day. And this was owing to two factors that have been lost in the mists of memory. The first is that although Rockefeller had been the embodiment of liberal Republicanism, he was always on the right side on foreign policy: the anti-Soviet side. A second is that the Rockefeller of the Seventies was, on domestic questions, a changed man. I was present at a small dinner party in 1972 when Governor Rockefeller raised his glass to Governor Reagan and said that he needed to admit that on most domestic issues, Reagan had been wiser than he. 
<P>
4. If Colin Powell accepts the nomination, nothing like the treachery suggested will have been done. In 1964 I urged candidate Goldwater to name ex-President Eisenhower as his running-mate. Quixotic stuff, but an early recognition that a presidential candidate wants a running-mate who will help him get to the White House, and it dazzles the imagination that anyone who cares about abortion or affirmative action would in effect endorse the re-election of Bill Clinton for the platonic satisfaction of a loyalty-test rejection of Colin Powell.

Who says Ross Perot is unpredictable? As soon as Bob  Dole wrapped up the nomination and the press needed something to write about, the Texan stepped into the vacuum with media-teasing talk of running for President again (but only, of course, if his supporters and hired political operatives around the country draft him). Perot represents the rot of American politics, a populism that is off the point (avoiding the gut-level issues that bother Americans), mindless (refusing to distinguish between the GOP Congress and President Clinton), and destructive (seeking, ultimately, to encourage cynicism among the voting public). After bringing the balanced budget to the fore in 1992, Perot stood idly by as Republicans banged their heads against a wall trying to enact one. Now, naturally, he attacks them for failing. The focus of Perot's 1996 campaign will be campaign-finance reform. So, naturally, he will spend $60 million of his own cash denouncing the role of money in politics. Enough people seem to be onto this act that Perot will be relegated this time around to single digits (where his support will be drawn in unpredictable proportions from Dole and Clinton). Then, this particular crazy aunt will finally be put back into the basement.

On March 28, the Senate Judiciary Committee adopted an amendment to the immigration-reform bill introduced by Alan Simpson (R., Wyo.) to increase -- yes, increase -- legal immigration by more than 100,000. The amendment's supporters, including Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.), Spencer Abraham (R., Mich.), Paul Simon (D., Ill.), and Mike DeWine (R., Ohio), manipulated statistics to present their plan as a moderate reduction in family-preference and ``diversity'' immigration. But Rosemary Jenks of the Center for Immigration Studies points out that while the original Simpson bill would have cut total legal immigration to an estimated 600,000 a year during the first five years, and to just over 450,000 thereafter, the Kennedy - Abraham amendment would push legal immigration to more than 830,000 while reducing the share of visas for skilled workers from 20 per cent under the original bill to a maximum of 15.6 per cent. (Unused visas for skilled workers would be allocated to family-based immigrants, although the immigrationists tell us that there is a shortage of skill-based immigrants.) Kennedy, Abraham, Simon, DeWine, Orrin Hatch (R., Utah), Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.), Dianne Feinstein (D., Calif.), and Russ Feingold (D., Wis.) voted for the amendment; Simpson, Strom Thurmond (R., S.C.), Hank Brown (R., Colo.), and Jon Kyl (R., Ariz.) voted nay. That makes the breakdown: Republicans, opposed; Democrats and Mugwumps, in favor.

In 1998, get ready for Tom Campbell, Republican senatorial nominee from California. At least that's what the moderate congressman was thinking when he hatched the idea of switching California's primaries from ``closed'' to ``open.'' Translation: Instead of only Republicans being permitted to vote for their party's nominee, Democrats can vote in the GOP primary too (and vice versa). The intention is to make it easier for moderates like Campbell -- who narrowly lost to conservative Bruce Herschensohn in a 1992 primary -- to draw the votes of Democrats and dilute the strength of conservatives. Bankrolled by the late David Packard, a Campbell backer, a ballot measure to open the primaries, effective in 1998, passed easily in late March. Both parties opposed it. But the battle was lost early on when ballot language was approved describing Proposition 198 in such goo-goo terms that voting against it seemed like opposing democracy itself. Now the parties have to figure out another way -- perhaps a law suit or a counter-initiative -- to preserve the integrity of their primaries. As for Campbell, there's nothing about his eager desire to win Democratic primary votes that a simple switch in registration wouldn't satisfy.

The Freemen, currently holed up near tiny Jordan, Montana, ran an elaborate check-fraud and counterfeiting operation that since late 1994 bilked businesses and the government of around $1.8 million. They held seminars on tax evasion and check fraud for other free spirits from across the nation. They set bounties on local officials and threatened their lives. And they did it all undisturbed by federal law enforcement. The Freemen are the Loony Right's answer to Rodney King. America's most famous drunk driver, you'll remember, has a free pass for life from an LAPD not eager to tangle with him again. The Freemen almost got similar treatment from the FBI and its director, Louis Freeh, rightly chastened by Waco and Ruby Ridge. Members of the Freemen had been indicted by a federal grand jury for offenses related to their creative financing back in May 1995. But the FBI didn't dare arrest them. It took the local county attorney begging for action, and a local farmer rounding up a 25-man posse to storm the group's stronghold, before the feds acted. Now that there is a siege on, the FBI is wise to heed the lessons of the past and take it slow. But a lesson can be learned too well. Mr. Freeh, it's OK to arrest nuts when they also happen to be crooks.

We're all free-traders now. Right? Wrong. Case in point, the latest G-7 conference on employment. Further liberalization of world trade, said Jacques Chirac, requires ``a few basic rules'' to be applied universally ``so as to guarantee the dignity of the working man, wherever in the world he may be.'' Translation: The onerous employment restrictions that make it nearly impossible to downsize in Europe, along with European-style entitlements (and their corollary -- high rates of unemployment and taxation), must be adopted in the U.S. and Japan. Chirac avers that different wage and employment laws would be ``less and less tolerated'' as international competition grows. We agree: left to itself, free trade will invariably shrink government in countries that have too much of it. But Robert Reich is supporting Chirac, and the International Labor Organization in demanding uniformity -- at Europe's levels. Perhaps someone should teach the Labor Secretary some French, as in, Vive la difference.

A cohort of GOP leaders, from Dole and Gingrich on down, appeared at a March 21 news conference to announce the Defend America Act of 1996. Its aim is to require the deployment by 2003 of an anti-missile defense for the United States. President Clinton, in thrall to outmoded strategic doctrines, vetoed a similar provision in the 1996 defense-authorization bill and has slowed down procurement of theater missile defenses as well. But the congressional leaders rightly cited the emerging missile threat not only from rogue states like Iran, Iraq, and North Korea, but also from China: Gingrich quoted a Chinese official who recently boasted to a visiting American that Taiwan was vulnerable because the U.S. would never risk Los Angeles. Protecting this country and its forces and friends abroad is an obvious strategic priority -- a political priority, if the Democrats shirk it.

The National Association of Scholars has just issued a study called ``The Dissolution of General Education, 1914 - 1993,'' documenting the precipitous drop in mandatory coursework in American universities and colleges, particularly since the 1960s. This amounts to the loss of a common core of knowledge once deemed essential to a liberal education; college students can now remain intellectual freshmen for four years. In 1914, 98 per cent of elite schools required English composition; by 1993, the figure had dropped to 36 per cent, making way for the advent of remedial English comp, which is often merely a diet of ``free writing'' exercises. Courses in foreign languages were required by 90 per cent of top schools in 1964, by 66 per cent in 1993; courses in history, by 38 per cent in 1964, 12 per cent in 1993. The proportion requiring literature courses dropped from 57 per cent in 1914 to 14 per cent in 1993, mathematics courses, from 82 to 12 per cent. The study concludes that the well-structured general education has ``largely vanished,'' causing ``a purging from the curriculum of many of the required basic survey courses that used to familiarize students with the historical, cultural, political, and scientific foundations of their society.'' In this light, multiculturalism begins to make sense: it gives students the soothing feeling that what they don't know isn't worth knowing.

This week's new disease is hyperlexia. It means taking, quote, an ``unusual'' interest in letters and numbers, and learning to read and spell, quote, ``too soon.'' In other words, being a bright kid. This ``affliction'' has all the earmarks of being invented by public-school psychologists. Children who can read must be a nightmare in a lot of public schools. They make it difficult to dumb down the rest of the class at an orderly pace, and they're much smarter than the average member of the teachers' unions.

Bishop Fabian Bruskewitz of Lincoln, Nebraska, has put his flock on notice that they must choose between being Catholics in good standing and belonging to organizations that oppose Church teachings. The proscribed organizations include Planned Parenthood and the Hemlock Society, as might be expected, but also super-traditionalist groups that reject the Second Vatican Council as heretical. The media blazoned, ``Bishop Threatens to Excommunicate Dissenting Catholics.'' Another way of putting it is that Bishop Bruskewitz is doing his pastoral duty in alerting people to the fact that they have removed themselves from communion. He apparently believes that he who affirms A on Sunday cannot affirm not-A on Monday. Public, persistent, and knowing agitation against the teaching of the Church is not compatible with membership in it. That's not so difficult to grasp. While canon lawyers reportedly mull the legal niceties of the bishop's action, we believe that he has made a very good start that other church leaders (and not only Roman Catholic) might think about emulating.

Any kid can figure out how to get on the Internet, but the IRS, after spending $4 billion to modernize its 1960s-era computers, still has to truck taxpayers' records from one office to another on magnetic tapes. The Treasury Department acknowledges that the IRS modernization is ``badly off track,'' but has not called off plans to spend over $16 billion more. Still, if that's all it costs to keep the IRS primitive, it's a bargain.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>F</FONT>OR American liberals, Thomas Jefferson is the cultural hero par excellence, cherished for his positions on freedom of expression and on separation of Church and State and for his populistic rhetoric. (That this was a populism for whites only is a fact which American liberals have managed not to address.)
<P>
Of course Jefferson is a hero to many Americans apart from liberals, and his admirers include, as we now know, some white right-wing terrorists. On July 3, 1995, the Washington Post published Serge Kovaleski's profile of Terry Lynn Nichols, the second man charged in the Oklahoma City bombing. According to Kovaleski, Nichols read the works of Thomas Jefferson and Thomas Paine and was particularly inspired by Jefferson's maxim, ``The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.''
<P>
According to CNN News (January 31, 1996), the first suspect in the Oklahoma City bombing, Timothy McVeigh, was wearing a T-shirt carrying those same words at the time he was arrested while driving away from Oklahoma City. The CNN correspondent, Susan Candiotti, put a question about the T-shirt to McVeigh's lawyer, Stephen Jones. Jones replied: ``Well, if Thomas Jefferson said it, I don't think it would be incriminating at all.''
<P>
Jefferson did say it. He wrote those words in a letter to William Stevens Smith on November 13, 1787. Jefferson was writing from Paris, where he was Minister Plenipotentiary at the time, but the words do not imply any premonition of impending revolution in France. They are used in justification of Shays's Rebellion in Massachusetts. In the letter to Smith, the words, ``It is its natural manure,'' appear after ``blood of patriots and tyrants.''
<P>
Jefferson did not have the French Revolution in mind when he wrote those words. But as soon as that revolution began he wrote about it in the ``tree of liberty'' spirit, and set virtually no limits to the amount of blood the French Revolutionaries might legitimately shed in the cause of liberty -- ``Rather than it should have failed, I would have seen half the earth desolated.'' So Jefferson wrote in January 1793 after the news of the September massacres in Paris had reached America.
<P>
The concept of the bloodthirsty tree of liberty entered into the rhetoric of the French Revolution itself and specifically into the rhetoric of the Revolutionary Terror. The terrorist Bertrand Barcre used a variant of it in the peroration of his speech calling for the execution of Louis XVI: ``The tree of liberty, as an ancient author remarks, flourishes when it is watered with the blood of all varieties of tyrants.'' Macaulay, whose knowledge of classical literature was prodigious, did not believe in the existence of Barcre's ``ancient author'': ``In the course of our own small reading among the Greek and Latin writers, we have not happened to fall in with trees of liberty and watering-pots full of blood, nor can we, such is our ignorance of classical ambiguity, even imagine an Attic or Roman orator employing imagery of that sort'' (Edinburgh Review, April 1844).
<P>
We know (as Macaulay probably did not) that Thomas Jefferson had ``employed imagery of that sort'' five years before Barcre did and in the same city. Could the idea have reached Barcre from Jefferson? Conceivably. Barcre could not have known of Jefferson's letter of five years before to an American correspondent. But Jefferson had been in Paris for the Fall of the Bastille, which was accompanied and followed by a number of bloody episodes. Jefferson's dispatches and letters of the period reflect a sober appreciation of the efficiency of mob violence in a revolutionary situation. ``The decapitation of de Launay worked powerfully thro' the night on the whole aristocratical party [so that they realized] the absolute necessity that the king should give up everything to the States [General].'' Some of Jefferson's acquaintances in Paris (who mostly belonged, like La Rochefoucauld and Condorcet, to the Enlightenment section of the nobility) may well have been shocked by the bloodshed, and have said so to Jefferson. If so, he could well have comforted them with some version of the thought about the tree of liberty and its natural manure. The story could then have gone the rounds and eventually reached the ears which were most likely to be attracted by the characteristics of that tree.
<P>
In any case, the bloodthirsty tree remains part of the revolutionary and terrorist traditions in the twentieth century. In ``The Rose Tree'' -- the most ``revolutionary'' of the four poems W. B. Yeats wrote about the Easter Rising of 1916 -- the last stanza runs:
<P>
<blockquote>
``But where can we draw water,''<BR>
Said Pearse to Connolly,<BR>
``When all the wells are parched away?<BR>
O plain as plain can be<BR>
There's nothing but our own red blood<BR>
Can make a right Rose Tree.''
</blockquote>
<P>
Yeats was probably not aware of the Jeffersonian origins of his metaphor. But I have heard the Jeffersonian passage about the tree correctly quoted, and properly attributed, by people who were interested in legitimizing the terror offensive of the Provisional IRA, which began in 1971, was suspended in 1994, and again resumed in February of this year.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>L</FONT>IBERALISM and terrorism appear as opposing concepts. But they have something in common. Both belong to the large and heterogeneous family of the devotees of freedom. Freedom is the most powerful and the most ambiguous of abstract ideas. There are two main divisions within the massive ambiguities. There is freedom combined with order and limited by law. This is the freedom of England's Glorious Revolution and of the American Constitution. This is the ``manly, moral, regulated liberty'' which Burke defended in Reflections on the Revolution in France. This is the freedom of the mainstream liberal tradition in the English-speaking world. And it is also the freedom of the mainstream conservative tradition in the same world. In their philosophy of freedom, the common ground between the two traditions is more important than the differences. Edmund Burke belongs to both those traditions, and no one should seek to wrest him from one of them in order to monopolize him for the other.
<P>
Outside the zone of ordered freedom, now more or less coextensive with the Western world, the idea of freedom and the love of freedom take starker and more elemental forms. Freedom is thought of as the appurtenance and rightful heritage of a particular group of people defined by nationality, religion, language, ancestry, or territorial affiliation, and usually by some combination of several of these elements. Some other group or groups of people are felt to be denying freedom to us, who must have it. Freedom so understood is one of the most powerful of human motivating forces and the most destructive, impelling large numbers of people to risk their lives for it and to take the lives of others, the enemies of freedom. Serbs and Croats cut one another's throats, and all for freedom's sake.
<P>
When the Communist system collapsed in Europe, many Westerners were confident that freedom would take its place, and so it did. But in many parts of the former Soviet Union, the freedom that emerged was not freedom as understood in the West, but rather a conflict of freedoms: national and ethnic freedoms, at war with one another. Russians are making a brave effort to establish an ordered version of freedom, but that version is challenged by other versions.
<P>
Much of the world today breathes what Edmund Burke called ``the wild gas'' of liberty. Burke used that phrase about the French Revolution in the condition it was in in 1790, a year after the Fall of the Bastille, and two years before the advent of the Terror. The Whigs -- the ancestors of modern liberals -- believed that the French Revolution was over, having brought about the triumph of liberty. Burke was about to break with the Whigs, over that proposition. He wrote in Reflections:
<P>
``When I see the spirit of liberty in action, I see a strong principle at work; and this, for a while, is all I can know of it. The wild gas, the fixed air is plainly broke loose; but we ought to suspend our judgment until the first effervescence is a little subdued, till the liquor is cleared and until we see something deeper than the agitation of a troubled and frothy surface. I must be tolerably sure before I venture publicly to congratulate men upon a blessing that they have really received one. I should therefore suspend my congratulations on the new liberty of France, until I was informed how it had been combined with government, with public force, with the discipline and obedience of armies, with the collection of an effective and well-distributed revenue; with morality and religion; with the solidity of property; with peace and order; with civil and social manners. All these (in their way) are good things too, and, without them, liberty is not a benefit in itself, and is not likely to continue long. The effect of liberty to individuals is, that they may do what they please. We ought to see what it will please them to do, before we risk congratulations, which may soon be turned into complaints.''
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT> REFERRED just now to the contrast between ``ordered liberty'' in the West, and passionate versions of liberty in the world outside. The contrast is obvious, but it is not clear cut. Within the West also there are passionate absolutist libertarians claiming inspiration from within the Western tradition, as in the cases of the persons arrested for the Oklahoma City bombing. And Western liberals are ill-prepared to cope with terrorism. This is a question of psychology, not of formal liberal doctrine. In the British tradition that doctrine was formulated most authoritatively by John Stuart Mill in On Liberty. Mill wrote: ``The sole end for which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number, is self-protection.'' The doctrine of ``self-protection'' would seem to authorize democratic societies to take such measures as may be necessary to defend the citizens against terrorist conspiracies, without defection from liberal principles. If the ordinary courts, and the ordinary criminal laws, are inadequate to protect the citizens from terrorism, then a liberal of the school of Mill could legislate, without a qualm of principle, for the introduction of internment without trial of persons whom the security authorities believe to be terrorists.
<P>
John Stuart Mill is the leading British liberal thinker. But a figure more representative of the British liberal tradition is the great liberal politician, William Ewart Gladstone. And Gladstone is the classic embodiment of the weakness of the English liberal mind in trying to cope with terrorism. Gladstone admitted that his whole attitude to Ireland was changed overnight by a single Irish terrorist act: the Fenian bombing of Clerkenwell Prison in 1867. That bomb convinced Gladstone that the Irish must be suffering from terrible grievances, which it was his duty to remove. ``My mission is to pacify Ireland,'' he declared. He tried to do this by a series of reforms, beginning with the disestablishment of the Irish (Anglican) Church in 1870.
<P>
The Irish terrorists were not interested in matters like Church disestablishment. But they were very interested in the effect which their Clerkenwell bomb had had on the mind of the leading British politician of the day. What Gladstone's reaction to that bomb taught them was that terrorism works. And that lesson is the most enduring legacy of Gladstonian liberalism. ``Violence is the only thing the British understand'' is the favorite maxim of Irish Republicans even today. Canary Wharf in 1996 is heir to Clerkenwell in 1867.
<P>
At the level of logic, the liberal mind is in the grip of a fallacy: that terrorism can be rooted out by concessions and compromise, without any need to resort to inconvenient and painful emergency measures, like internment. This is a fallacy, because the terrorist mind is absolutist and unappeasable. Irish terrorists want to destroy Northern Ireland, and will not voluntarily stop anywhere short of that. Arab terrorists want to destroy Israel, and will not voluntarily stop anywhere short of that. Both sets of terrorists are interested in concessions and efforts at compromise only as evidence that the bombings are moving the enemy in the right direction, however slowly.
<P>
Compromises are possible, of course, but only with terrorists who are willing to become ex-terrorists, like Michael Collins in the 1920s or Arafat now. But terrorism survived the compromises. In the current case, Israel surrendered territory to Arafat, hoping to get peace in exchange. But unreconstructed terrorists, ignoring Arafat, have been able to use the territory surrendered as a base for attacks on Israel.
<P>
To seek to end terrorism by compromise is a fallacy in logic, because it misrepresents the nature of the phenomenon with which it attempts to cope. But beneath the fallacy lies a powerful emotional force: guilt (exceptionally strong in Gladstone, for example). British Gladstonian liberals -- to be found today among both Tories and Labourites -- feel chronically guilty about Britain's past treatment of Ireland. Israeli doves -- the liberals of Israel -- feel guilty about Israel's treatment of Palestinian Arabs. In both cases, there are some reasons for guilt. Unfortunately, feelings of guilt are of no help in the struggle against terrorism. On the contrary, they are a resource which the terrorist knows he can exploit, and he does so with a savage satisfaction.
<P>
In some cases, but not in all, there are political initiatives that could isolate the terrorists, and perhaps eventually lead to their defeat. For Israel, peace with Syria is the best available option: to give back the Golan Heights, in exchange for which Syria would eliminate terrorism in Lebanon and dry up the sources of supply for terrorists in the Territories.
<P>
In Northern Ireland, unfortunately, no promising political option is within reach. There are two sets of private armies there, a Protestant one and a Catholic one. Efforts to appease one -- at present the Catholics -- do not appease it, and they risk arousing the latent violence of the other one. Efforts to make the realities of Northern Ireland conform to a Gladstonian agenda are doomed to failure. The best hope for Northern Ireland would be a co-ordination of security measures between London and Dublin, including the introduction of internment -- applied evenly to both sets of political-sectarian paramilitaries -- on both sides of the border. (Which worked during the Second World War and in 1957 - 1962.) At present British and Irish versions of liberalism (combining in Ireland with nationalism) inhibit that response. I fear that the necessary measures will not be taken until things get much worse. The IRA promises another 25 years of ``war.''
<P>
<FONT SIZE=+3>I</FONT>F THE terrorist threat increases in America, American liberals are likely to oppose any counter-measures which may be proposed against it. In doing so they will claim the sanction of Thomas Jefferson, whose protests against the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 are part of the charter of American liberalism. But I don't think American liberalism is strong enough, in itself, to inhibit counter-measures against terrorism. What might inhibit them is something different but cognate: the dislike among millions of Americans for the restraints and constraints of ``ordered freedom'' and a taste for the absolute stuff, straight out of the bottle: the version of the Jeffersonian tradition offered by McVeigh and Nichols. Most of the five million members of the National Rifle Association no doubt repudiate terrorist acts. But most of them would oppose any serious clampdown on terrorists who happened to be white, Christian, and conservative. So liberals protesting against an anti-terrorist clampdown would have some unaccustomed allies. If American terrorism ever acquires sustained momentum, it could be more dangerous than is today's terrorism in the Middle East and the British Isles.
<P>
Let me close with a pair of disquieting statistics. I have seen it estimated that there are between thirty and forty thousand armed men in the militia movement who regard themselves as either at war or on the verge of war with the Federal Government. The total active membership of the IRA is reckoned as between two and three thousand.

<P>
Dear Rusty,
<P>
We're tops in the polls, the economy looks solid, Perot might run, and no one's stepped on a land mine yet in Bosnia. So why am I so down? 
<P>
I started feeling not-totally-up at yesterday's campaign-strategy meeting. We've been having these monthly meetings for a year now, and it was just me, Bill, Dick Morris, and HRC. And with HRC in Bosnia, I thought it would be a cozy threesome -- a time when Bill, Dick, and I could start some long-range thinking about the next 12 years, when the country transitions from a Bill Clinton operating system to an Al Gore operating system.
<P>
But now that polls have started showing us 23 points ahead of Bob Dole, the room was packed. There was George Stephanopoulos, Mandy Grunwald, Mack McClarty, Vernon Jordan, Leon Panetta, the entire White House Fellows program, Joe Klein (for some reason), and some people I've never seen before. A large man in a blue windbreaker sat against the wall, eating doughnuts out of a carton. I walked up to him. ``You're a Secret Service agent, right?'' 
<P>
``Wrong.'' He reached into his pocket and handed me a card. ``AFL-CIO, campaign division. You gots a problem with me, you gots a problem with my boys on K Street. So what's it gonna be?'' 
<P>
``This is supposed to be a closed meeting,'' I said, as politely as possible. 
<P>
``So close it,'' he said, shrugging. He jerked a thumb at Stephanopoulos. ``Kick pretty boy out. But me, I paid 35 mil for this seat and I ain't givin' it up. So if you'll excuse me, I'd like to get back to my cruller.'' 
<P>
This was too much. We had made such great strides in the past few months keeping the meetings organized and efficient. It seemed like our poll numbers were encouraging the staff to slip back into old bad habits. I ducked out into the hallway to wait for Bill.
<P>
As he strode up, I stopped him. ``Bill,'' I said, ``I've got some bad news.'' 
<P>
He went pale and bit his lower lip. ``Oh my Lord,'' he quavered. ``It's Hillary, isn't it? She's been killed in a Serb mortar attack? Oh what a fool I was to allow her to go!'' 
<P>
``Bill!'' I said. ``Hillary didn't get killed in a mortar attack.'' 
<P>
``A Greek terrorist suicide bus bomb?'' 
<P>
``No,'' I said. 
<P>
``What, then?'' he asked, sighing. 
<P>
``I just wanted to warn you that the meeting is packed. We're starting to lose our discipline again. We're getting too complacent. This meeting has so many people, it could go on forever.''
<P>
Bill smiled. ``I know,'' he said. ``Isn't it cool?'' 
<P>
The meeting itself went not much better. Actually the AFL-CIO guy wasn't a problem. He never made a sound, except for some paper rustling and napkin dabbing. He and Bill argued briefly over who touched the honey-glazed first, but other than that, he wasn't there. 
<P>
But Stephanopoulos must have asked nine times if the time wasn't right for Bill to resubmit his health-care program, now that his poll numbers are above 50 per cent. Dick patiently explained nine times that the reason Bill's poll numbers were above 50 per cent was because people had forgotten about his health-care program, which, frankly, I dispute, since many portions of it -- the mental-health task force in particular -- enjoyed widespread support. 
<P>
Finally, the subject came around to the budget.
<P>
``I'm concerned,'' I said, ``that the budget plan may end up hurting more than helping us.'' 
<P>
``How so?'' Dick asked. 
<P>
``Well,'' I said, ``I think the people are looking for leadership here, and I'm not sure that we're giving it to them.'' 
<P>
``We balance the budget in seven years, Mr. Vice President. What more do you want?'' 
<P>
``But we don't, really,'' I said. ``We don't make any real cuts for four years. All the cuts are made in the back three years.'' 
<P>
Bill chimed in. ``Al, with all due respect, those 'back three years' you're talking about -- hey, I plan to be in Cambridge, Massachusetts, as Dean of the Kennedy School, working on two things -- my memoirs as a two-termer, and some co-eds.'' 
<P>
``But I plan to be here, filling out my first term as your successor,'' I said. ``So why don't we take the long view, and spread the budget cuts evenly over the seven years?'' 
<P>
Bill looked out the window for a moment. He took a bite of his doughnut. ``You know,'' he said quietly, ``I'll bet George Bush said that same thing in this same room 12 years ago.'' 
<P>
And then he headed out of the meeting. So you can see why I'm depressed.

<P>
NEW YORK, MARCH 26
<P>
After months and months of negotiation, one American enterprise made a deal with the half-dozen most critical custodians of Soviet data. It would bring out 25 volumes, perhaps as many as 50, laying bare, so to speak, the minutes of the Communist era, 1917 - 1991. It wasn't the State Department that managed this, or the CIA, or the Library of Congress, let alone the National Endowment for the Humanities. It was Yale University Press. Jonathan Brent, its executive editor, made a deal that gave U.S. scholars the right to research and to publish the critical archives of the regime. Of the KGB, the military, the Presidium, the Central Committee, the foreign ministry. The terms? The Yale University Press is obliged to publish its volumes simultaneously in Russian, for distribution from Moscow.
<P>
Now this enterprise is a huge contribution to an understanding of the most important political phenomenon of the century, the rise and fall of the Communist international movement. The documents tell us not only about the workaday machinations of the largest totalitarian organization in history, but also about its actors. We have already from the Annals of Communism series a volume giving us the letters written by Stalin to Molotov, his most trusted subordinate -- arguably, his only trusted subordinate. They tell us things many of us more or less knew -- that Stalin was suspicious, ruthless, ironhanded -- but they do so with the finality of the holographic original. Labor problem out there? Stalin writes to his lieutenant, ``Definitely shoot two or three dozen wreckers from these apparaty [sic], including several dozen common cashiers.'' Volumes are scheduled, all of them edited under scrupulous scholarly supervision, that deal with the last days of the Romanovs. There will be volumes on Lenin's secret archive, the church, the people and the Bolsheviks, Soviet politics and repression, the diary of Georgi Dimitrov, the assassination of Sergei Kirov . . . ``What Saudi is to oil, these records are to twentieth-century history,'' Bruce Nelan wrote in Time magazine.
<P>
Now here is the problem. 
<P>
The parliamentary turmoil in Russia casts long shadows. The Russian Left has never liked the idea of disgorging all the secrets because they have the effect of eviscerating any trace of idealism in the Soviet experiment, at least in the hands of its generals. And the Russian Right doesn't like it because the firm hand of authoritarian government beckons to a society punchdrunk with liberalism and suffering now corruption, crime, inflation, and unemployment. The elections in June could very well result in a Communist victory. How long between such a development and a freeze of the agreement with Yale? It would not happen overnight, and there would be great pressure from the archival community within Russia to continue with the operation. The publications are of academic and historical interest to the United States. Their importance to Russia has to do with the country's future. And the volatility of the political situation justifies proceeding without delay. 
<P>
And the U.S. problem? Funds. The usual good soldiers have made contributions -- Olin, Smith Richardson, Bradley -- but, to date, less than $400,000 (out of $3 million needed) has been raised. The project is unique. If it were less than that we could say of it that it is ``the kind of thing'' the National Endowment for the Humanities was created to encourage. Why not? Why not the Ford Foundation? The Rockefeller Foundation? The MacArthur Fund?
<P>
The judgment of this observer is that we have here something on the order of a biblical narrative discrediting everything about the Soviet Union popularized by leftist fancy for two generations. The hero John Reed turns out to have been paid $1 million for his work as a Soviet agent. The labor-union movement was primarily an instrument of Soviet power. The independent ``progressive'' movements in the United States, France, Italy were Moscow operations. We have here a historical juggernaut capable of refashioning the trendy history in which so many American scholars were once ensnared; and they are not in the mood, many of them, to invite the coroner to certify to their naivete.

Imagine, just imagine the amount of money that would have flowed in if an early document had established that Alger Hiss was, through 1935 - 1945, a U.S. patriot, untempted by any ideological wind east of the New Deal. If such a document existed, the MacArthur types would have handed the Yale enterprise the keys to their treasuries. The National Endowment? You account for it. But if you have influence, use it to raise money for the Annals of Communism series of the Yale University Press, Executive Editor, Jonathan Brent, 302 Temple Street, New Haven, Connecticut 06520.

He came, he spent, he went. That is the Beltway wiseguy epitaph on the Steve Forbes campaign. But that shows you what wiseguys know. Mr. Forbes ran a campaign of good humor and principle, in the face of ruthless counterattacks from the Dole forces. Ultimately, he focused on a too-narrow range of issues. But his issues -- economic optimism and a populist approach to tax cuts -- will be essential to GOP victory in November. To make his case, he spent $25 million of his own money, which occasioned much hand-wringing. Another way to look at Forbes's campaign potlatch is that it costs that much to get neglected ideas through the fog of reporters' and politicians' indifference. (Pat Buchanan, the other high-profile outsider, profited from years of television and newspaper commentary.) A clever GOP establishment, having taken Mr. Forbes and Mr. Buchanan to the cleaners, would selectively steal their clothes.

Before the agony of last year's budget fight is fully over, along comes President Clinton's proposed 1997 budget. There's not much new: the same tepid tax cuts combined with lots of ``loophole closers''; the same bogus, unspecified spending cuts set to take effect sometime after Clinton has ended his second term; the same very real spending increases today (both spending and the deficit would go up in 1997). In short, the latest Clinton budget is as craven a political document as the eight ones that preceded it in the last 12 months. The first thing Republicans should do in response is: Get over it! It should be clear by now that Clinton isn't going to cut a deal, nor is he going to play straight with his numbers. So, there need be no more talk from Republicans of government shutdowns, of defaults, of CBO scoring, of saving Medicare, of balance in 2002. (We hope Newt Gingrich is kidding when he talks of making his troops vote on another massive balanced-budget plan this spring.) Instead, Republicans should put the remnants of the fight over 1996 spending behind them as quickly as possible, and declare victory: thanks to their series of tight continuing resolutions, the deficit will indeed decline steeply this year. Republicans should restrain 1997 spending with another tight CR (avoiding fights over budgetary details) and then change the subject. Any budget talk should focus on tax cuts to counteract the effects of the Clinton Crunch, and on widely popular proposals like the Balanced Budget Amendment. The President has gotten a free ride for a year because he has been the only one playing politics on the budget. Last year the Republicans couldn't beat him; now it's time to join him.

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde is used to fighting attempts from the Left to water down crime bills. But when the House recently took up anti-terrorism legislation, it was conservative freshman Bob Barr (R., Ga.) -- cheered on by the National Rifle Association -- who led an effort to gut the bill, over the opposition of the likes of liberal Brooklyn Democrat Charles Schumer. What accounts for the strange turnabout? Hyde got part of the answer in the House cloakroom when one GOP colleague told him: ``I trust Hamas more than my own government.'' After Waco and Ruby Ridge, a radical distrust of federal law enforcement, reminiscent of the New Left, has infected parts of the Right. There is ample reason to distrust centralized police power, and any abuse of it must be exposed and punished promptly, which famously did not occur with Ruby Ridge or Waco. But limitless distrust offends against both good sense and good politics. Rep. Barr worked successfully to strip from the anti-terrorism bill provisions that would have, among other things, allowed the expedited deportation of aliens linked to terrorism and permitted the Federal Government to designate foreign groups as terrorist and outlaw U.S. fund-raising for them. Idaho conservative Rep. Helen Chenoweth went further, co-sponsoring an amendment to scuttle habeas-corpus reforms long sought by Republicans, lest they be wielded against those ``wrongfully prosecuted for exercising their constitutional right to keep and bear arms.'' Needless to say, the Clinton Administration was overjoyed with the newly soft-on- crime GOP. And it will be treated to more of the same until some House Republicans learn the difference between Hamas and the FBI.

To those who have been hoping there will be significant cuts in corporate welfare once Senator Ethanol steps down as Majority Leader, meet Senator Bilge-Pump. Trent Lott (Miss.), Mr. Dole's likely successor and the son of a shipyard pipefitter, is leading the effort to ram a ten-year extension of federal maritime subsidies through Congress. Although benefits to the shippers would be lower than in the past, the bill would still provide some $100 million annually in direct payments and continue to grant exclusive rights to $500 million in government contracts. Al Gore's government-waste committee recommended killing the subsidies in 1993, as did the House Budget Committee in 1994. Even the Pentagon, which once maintained that national security required a robust maritime industry, has backed off, citing the successful use of its own fleet and foreign firms during the Gulf War. By championing corporate welfare, Senator Lott lends credence to liberals who claim Congress is interested in slashing only the personal variety of welfare, and gives cover to Buchananites, who insist that government should spare domestic manufacturers from foreign competition. Tow the ten-year extension out into the Gulf of Mexico, and open the sea-cocks.

Is the era of strong economic growth over? Washington's latest buzz says so. Downsizing and global competition are not transitory phenomena. Neither is an aging population, and no one saves any more. History and circumstance, say the new pessimists, make the rising economic tide of the 1950s and 1960s unattainable in the 1990s. ``It might be good for our politics if some candidate acknowledged this,'' says Bill Kristol. Good for politics, maybe, but bad for economics. We refer the depressed reader to Peter Brimelow's ``It's the Taxes, Stupid,'' in the February 12 Forbes. Our economic funk, says Brimelow, is self-inflicted, by a government that extracts too much from its citizens. The evidence? Gerald Scully's econometric study of the entire period since World War II. Economic growth falters, Scully found, when the sum of federal, state, and local taxation exceeds 22.9 per cent of GDP -- a level breached forty years ago. Had taxes remained at that level, today's GDP would be twice as high as it is -- $15 trillion instead of $7.5 trillion. A typical family would have $100,000 more personal wealth. The kicker: Government would raise more revenue at the lower tax rate. And Bill Kristol would be peddling his (uncharacteristic) pessimism at a deep discount.

Just days after breaking ranks with other cigarette makers on a class-action suit aimed at the tobacco industry, the Liggett company agreed to compensate Florida, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Mississippi, and West Virginia for smoking-related Medicaid spending. Other tobacco makers are undoubtedly thinking of following Liggett's example. Listen up, you tobacco executives: Government should reward you, not fine you. Consider the recent National Bureau of Economic Research study by W. Kip Vicusi. The medical costs attributable to smoking come to 55 cents per pack, according to Vicusi. But smokers defray most of that with the 53-cent-per-pack cigarette tax already in place. Extra sick-leave costs are negligible -- under 1 cent per pack -- while health-insurance premiums rise 14 cents for every pack smoked. Smoking-related fires add less than 2 cents per pack in social costs. On the other hand, because smokers die sooner, they spend less time in nursing homes, saving 23 cents per pack. They collect less in Social Security and private pensions, saving $1.19 a pack. On the other hand, smokers' premature deaths deprive the rest of us of taxes they would have paid had they lived out their full span -- about 40 cents per pack, in Vicusi's calculation. Net net, every pack consumed saves society 83 cents. That comes to $20 billion a year. So stay the course. And thank you for smoking.

Hale is up for re-election, and the local paper is unhappy with him.

IFTY years ago, on April 18, 1946, Jackie Robinson broke organized baseball's color barrier with a characteristic bang, homering and scoring four runs in his historic first game for the Brooklyn Dodgers' top farm team. This anniversary will no doubt unleash a wave of media meditations, since it combines the two national pastimes of the American male intellectual: denouncing racism and waxing nostalgic over the Brooklyn Dodgers. Spike Lee is preparing The Jackie Robinson Saga, and I'm sure Stephen Jay Gould will favor us with his thoughts.
<P>
Yet, beyond the obvious platitudes, baseball's long struggle over race can yield some surprising perspectives on our national predicament. The Robinson epic is generally lumped in with the 1954 Brown decision against segregated public schools and the 1964 Civil Rights Act outlawing job discrimination. Yet two crucial differences stand out. 1) The integration of organized baseball preceded the civil-rights revolution, and in reality baseball helped make later reforms politically feasible by giving white Americans black heroes with whom to identify. 2) Government had almost nothing to do with this triumph of the competitive market. Baseball owners finally realized that the more they cared about the color of people's money, the less they could afford to care about the color of their skin.
<P>
It's ironic that the hallowed civil-rights revolution owed so much to something as seemingly trivial as pro sports. Yet, without this business of producing heroes for public consumption, whites might never have cared enough about blacks to be bothered by racial injustice. It's not the most noble trait of human nature, but we tend to be more outraged by minor slights to winners (note the endlessly recounted tales of the indignities Robinson endured) than by mass atrocities against downtrodden losers.
<P>
That competitive markets make irrational bigotry expensive -- not impossible, but costly -- was first formally demonstrated in 1957 by University of Chicago economist Gary Becker (the 1992 Nobel Laureate), and in the four decades since has barely gained a toehold in conventional thinking. Let me be clear: this idea does not pollyannaishly presume that white people (or any other people) are motivated by disinterested good will. It merely assumes that if forced to by competition, people will hire whoever makes them the most money. Don't forget, though, that we humans are always conniving to exempt ourselves from competition. The more we can insulate ourselves from the open market, the more painlessly we can then discriminate for kin and countrymen and against people we don't like. Baseball's often ugly history shows this clearly.
<P>
Back in the 1880s, when the term ``organized baseball'' reflected ambition more than reality, the general anarchy let a few dozen blacks play in integrated leagues. By the turn of the century, however, blacks had been utterly banished. Although liberal demonology would assume that the owners were the villains, the prime agitators for segregation were, as economic theory would predict, the white ballplayers. Cap Anson was the best known of the many white athletes who threatened strikes or violence against black rivals. The banning of blacks came up for a vote only once, in 1887 in the International League. Following many nasty anti-black demonstrations by white players, the owners of the six all-white teams outvoted the owners of the four mixed teams. Elsewhere, blacks were driven out by ``gentlemen's agreements.''
<P>
Why did all the owners, although often after some resistance, ultimately give in to rabble-rousing white players? Easing the slide into segregation was organized baseball's curious status as a sort of Portuguese man-of-war of economic entities -- in some ways an industry of independent competitors, in others a single enterprise. Baseball teams must agree upon how they will compete, and, while they're at it, it's always tempting to agree upon how they won't compete. Congress ratified organized baseball's collusive tendency in 1920 by exempting it from the Sherman Antitrust Act.
<P>
The team owners' ill-named ``gentlemen's agreement'' to discriminate against blacks closely resembles today's unspoken understanding among the presidents of another government-sanctioned cartel, our elite colleges, that they will all discriminate against whites and Asians. Both clubowners and college presidents chose to head off ugly incidents by pre-emptively caving in to racial activists. They then browbeat all their peers into closing ranks, lest a lone dissident spotlight their spinelessness.
<P>
When all teams colluded against blacks, each team could assure itself that it was no worse off competitively than if all hired blacks. Cartels often collapse quickly because of cheating, but it was easier to enforce a national ban on black ballplayers than on, say, black factory workers. A ballclub couldn't hide its black workers away inside the mill, but would have had to flaunt them on the road before hostile, even murderous crowds.
JACKIE ROBINSON'S vast (and deserved) fame tends to make us assume that blacks and whites never played together before April 1946. In truth, as the supply of black baseball talent exploded after World War I, the demand for it could not be contained either. There were of course the Negro Leagues. By the 1940s they were booming, and their All Star game frequently outdrew the white version. More forgotten are the many venues outside the South where blacks and whites increasingly played together. 1) Collegiate athletics had been haphazardly integrated for decades. At UCLA, for example, Robinson starred in baseball, football, basketball, track, tennis, golf, and swimming. 2) The California winter baseball league was integrated, though not its individual teams. 3) In the Caribbean winter leagues, race meant even less. Many teams had black and white American stars playing in the same lineups, with few problems. 4) In the mid Forties, a Mexican mogul raided both the Negro and the Major Leagues to stock his summer Mexican League's integrated teams. (Among 18 big-leaguers heading south after the 1945 season was Dodger catcher Mickey Owen. Whether this increased competition for whites encouraged the Dodgers' owner, Branch Rickey, to plunder the Negro Leagues is unknown, but it certainly didn't hurt.) 5) Semipro ball, which was hugely popular before TV, was surprisingly integrated. For instance, in 1935, Bismarck, North Dakota, fielded an awesome team, half white, half black, lead by the fabled pitcher Satchel Paige. Soon, practically every town in the Dakotas boasted ``semipros'' lured from the Negro Leagues. 6) Barnstorming was the chaotic epitome of Disorganized Baseball, requiring only two teams willing to play and a crowd willing to pay. In many Midwestern villages, the annual athletic highlight was the arrival of a Negro Leagues squad to play the local semipros. 7) Each October the black Satchel Paige All Stars and the white Dizzy Dean All Stars barnstormed the nation together. (Predictably, the blacks won a sizable majority of these games.) During World War II, Paige could claim to be the highest-paid player in all of baseball.
<P>
In the liberal world-view, discrimination stems from prejudice, from ignorance of the actual talents of blacks. In organized baseball, the opposite was true. White Major Leaguers freely admitted that many blacks could have taken white players' jobs. Yet, somehow, this enlightened perception failed to make the white pros into ardent integrationists. Meanwhile, a number of owners and managers tried to cheat on their gentlemen's agreement. For example, many historians claim that the Washington Senators quietly broke the color barrier in the late 1930s by playing Cubans dark enough to have been banned as Negroes if they had spoken English.
<P>
There was strikingly little correlation between the rectitude of the man and his urge to integrate baseball. For example, among managers the most creative was the choleric John J. McGraw, a ferocious scrapper who won ten pennants. In 1901 he almost succeeded in smuggling a light-skinned black second baseman onto his team as a full-blooded Cherokee named ``Chief Tokohama.'' During World War II huckster Bill Veeck tried to buy the dreadful Philadelphia Phillies and stock them with Negro Leagues stars. Like all direct challenges, though, this was rebuffed by the autocratic Commissioner of Baseball, Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis. After the Chicago Black Sox threw the 1919 World Series, the owners had restored faith in the game by appointing Landis, who was famed for his strict moral standards -- one of which was Segregation Forever. After the good Judge went to his reward in late 1944, the owners, hoping to lighten up, picked as Commissioner the Southern politician A. B. ``Happy'' Chandler. When Happy surprisingly indicated that he wouldn't veto black players, Branch Rickey set his plans in motion.
<P>
``Mahatma'' Rickey was as renowned as Landis for his righteousness (as Rickey tirelessly reminded his players while chiseling down their salaries). No one should look down upon Rickey, however; pursue his self-interest he certainly did, but with infinitely more intelligence and courage than his rival owners. (Today's elite colleges, for example, have yet to produce their own Branch Rickey, a school president brave enough to dump affirmative action.) Rickey chose Robinson because they had so much in common: both were Methodists who didn't smoke, drink, or chase women, and both were smart enough to know the historic importance of their undertaking. Most importantly, both were too competitive to back down.
<P>
Further undermining the naive presumption that breaking the color line was an act of progressive piety was the key role played by Rickey's favorite field manager, the little ferret Leo Durocher. Bonding the Mahatma and Leo the Lip was a shared passion for victory and money. During spring training in 1947, Rickey scheduled a series between the Dodgers and Robinson's minor-league team. He hoped that when the Dodger players saw Robinson's talents, they would demand his promotion. Instead, fearing for their jobs or those of their friends, they said nothing. But when some Dodgers from Dixie actively protested against Robinson, Durocher deflated their mutiny: ``I don't care if the guy is yellow or black, or if he has stripes like a f --  --  --  zebra. I'm the manager of this team, and I say he plays. What's more, I say he can make us all rich. And if any of you can't use the money, I'll see that you are all traded.''
<P>
WHAT lessons can we learn from this tangled tale? A few simple ones seem to leap out. The more greed and lust for victory, the less discrimination. The more competition between teams and businesses, the more cooperation between the races. In contrast, the more collusion, centralization, community standards, and concern for the feelings of people you know, the more bias. If we now look at the remarkable impact that the first few dozen blacks had on Major League baseball, we can confirm the Chicago School's theory that competition tends to make irrational discrimination self-defeatingly expensive.
The 1946 World Series looked as if it would be only the first of many between the Boston Red Sox and the St. Louis Cardinals. Led by Ted Williams, the greatest hitter since Babe Ruth, the 1946 Red Sox had won an exceptional 104 games, losing only 50. The Cardinals, meanwhile, had averaged 104 wins per season during the four seasons that the young Stan Musial had anchored their lineup. Both leftfielders would long remain superlative hitters. As late as 1957 Musial led the National League (NL) with a batting average of .351, while Williams topped even that with .388, the highest average between the Roosevelt and Carter Administrations. Yet neither man ever returned to the World Series. Why not?
<P>
Largely because of St. Louis's and Boston's boneheaded bigotry. With Robinson apprenticing in the minors throughout the 1946 season, the Brooklyn Dodgers finished two games behind the Cards. In 1947, Rookie of the Year Robinson made the difference, as the Dodgers edged the Cards for the pennant. Jackie instantly became the league's biggest draw, with the Dodgers setting NL records for both home and away attendance. During each pre-season alone, Robinson earned his annual salary from the huge Southern crowds, black and white, that turned out to cheer and boo him at Dodger exhibitions. (By barnstorming through Dixie, Rickey was exposing Robinson to a real threat of assassination, as well as the insults of Jim Crow, but, hey, the money was too good to pass up.)
<P>
Rickey followed up his masterstroke by signing more Negro Leagues stars like Roy Campanella and Don Newcombe. During Robinson's ten-year tenure, Brooklyn's dividends for desegregating first were six NL titles, fueled by black Dodgers' winning five Most Valuable Player awards and four Rookie of the Year awards.
<P>
In contrast, St. Louis frittered away the heart of Musial's stupendous career by not obtaining a black regular until Curt Flood in 1958. The Cards paid a brutal price for discriminating. During the first four years they had Stan the Man (up through 1946), the Cards won almost 18 more games per year than the Dodgers. But during the Robinson era, the Cards fell to nearly 13 victories per year fewer than the Dodgers, a monumental swing of over 30 wins per 154-game season. The Cardinals stubbornly ignored blacks until Augie Busch bought the team in 1954. Fearing a black boycott of Budweiser, he immediately ordered his scouts to find black players, but by then the easy pickings were gone. Although too late for Musial, Busch's integration move finally paid off in the 1960s, as blacks like Flood, Lou Brock, and Bob Gibson became the core of great Cardinal teams.
As could be expected, the National League, which had been sorely trailing the American League (AL) in superstars since the days of Ty Cobb, more aggressively pursued black talent. By the mid Fifties all NL teams except the Cardinals and the hapless Phillies featured at least one black headed for the Hall of Fame. Between 1949 and 1962, blacks won 11 of the 14 NL MVP awards, while no black was the AL MVP until Yankee catcher Elston Howard in 1963. And the AL lacked an African-American superstar until Frank Robinson arrived via a 1966 trade and promptly showed the league what it had been missing by capturing the rare Triple Crown for batting.
<P>
Integration electrified the NL's style of play, as blacks showed that sluggers didn't have to be sloggers -- e.g., Willie Mays led the league four times in home runs and four times in stolen bases. The balance of power shifted away from the slow, complacent American League. The AL had won 12 of the 16 All Star games played in the Thirties and Forties, but could capture only 5 of the 24 held in the Fifties and Sixties. 
<P>
Where competition is not particularly intense, however, discrimination can linger. In the AL, the New York Yankees ruled, winning 29 of 44 pennants from 1921 to 1964. Not surprisingly, the Yankees saw little need to rush into integrating, especially after they signed Mickey Mantle, a white man even faster and stronger than the NL's black stars. With most of the AL not expecting to dethrone the Yankees (indeed, some forlorn AL franchises subsisted by routinely selling their top prospects to the Yankees), most other AL teams also lagged at integrating. 
<P>
The main exception was the Cleveland Indians. Under master promoter Bill Veeck, in 1948 the Tribe suddenly overtook the Red Sox as the Yankees' chief challenger. The Indians edged out the Red Sox for the pennant that year by a single game, a difference more than accounted for by their two blacks, outfielder Larry Doby and a 42-year-old rookie phenom named Paige. As the AL's most integrated team, from 1948 to 1956 the Tribe would average 94 wins, peaking with a 111 - 43 record in 1954, the best anywhere since 1906. In comparison, under the ownership of beloved philanthropist Tom Yawkey, the Red Sox would fade into mediocrity, wasting Williams's bat as they refused to play a black man until 1959. Still, to be fair, the Red Sox did take only seven more years to hire a black than the Braves -- the Osaka Braves, that is.
<P>
WHILE the complete integration of baseball through competition took longer than we would have liked, it's worth contrasting baseball's record to the civil-rights milestones dependent upon the Federal Government. For example, the vaunted 1954 Brown decision remained mostly a symbol until the Nixon Administration began broadly enforcing it 15 years later. Likewise, although the decline in job discrimination in the South in the 1960s is often attributed to the 1964 Civil Rights Act, little of the now vast array of bureaucratic and legal machinery for enforcing that law existed before the end of that decade. Far more beneficial during the 1960s than pestering private companies was federal intervention freeing up the Southern economy by cracking down on state-authorized discrimination, whether imposed by legislatures or by mobs winked at by local authorities. These gains became permanent under the most wholly successful civil-rights law, the 1965 Voting Rights Act. By finally establishing a competitive market for political power, this law rapidly made hatemongering unprofitable for Southern office-seekers. 
<P>
Today, conservatives tend to lionize the 1964 Civil Rights Act for embodying color-blindness. In denouncing quotas while supporting anti-discrimination laws, however, the Right shows a surprising faith in the ability of government bureaucrats and judges to decide case by case which private hiring decisions were tainted by bias. In reality, close study of possible instances of discrimination shows why the sainted 1964 act made quotas inevitable. Frequently, no outsider, and sometimes not even those involved, can know which of the many possible reasons for an employment decision was actually conclusive.
For example, the Yankees first employed black minor-leaguers in 1949 but didn't promote any to the big club until 1955. Was this long delay caused by discrimination? If you assume that any team in the early 1950s that didn't have a few blacks must have been discriminating, it appears obvious that the Yankees were guilty. But if you reject this kind of statistical or quota-based reasoning, how do you find the smoking gun? Did the Yankees trade away their top prospect, the black Puerto Rican Vic Power, for his uppitiness (when a Southern waitress once told him, ``I'm sorry, but we don't serve Negroes here,'' he blithely replied, ``That's OK, I don't eat them'')? Or were they sincere in claiming they'd lost faith in his potential? Or both? Presumably bias played a role, since Power turned out to be a good (though not great) Major Leaguer. But who can say for sure? Ballclubs constantly make honest mistakes about minor-leaguers (in the same period, the integrated Dodgers discarded another young black Puerto Rican, the great Roberto Clemente). Did the Yankees then force their other most promising black minor-leaguer, outfielder Elston Howard, to convert to catcher in order to delay his rise to the big leagues? Possibly, but this time the Yankees proved right, as Howard became an MVP behind the plate.
<P>
This ambiguity inherent in so many hiring decisions explains why aggressive anti-discrimination laws always end up impelling employers toward quotas. Unfortunately, racial quotas have numerous side effects. While the overall impact of reverse discrimination remains harshly controversial, we can safely say that year by year quotas' benefits to blacks diminish while quotas' costs to blacks rise. Since strong anti-bias laws make quotas inevitable and quotas are inexorably becoming a net harm to blacks, then logic would imply that we must eventually repeal enforcement of the Civil Rights Act's prohibitions against discrimination by competitive employers. 
<P>
How, then would we fight racism in hiring? I suggest: in roughly the same way as we now deter its cousin, nepotism. In noncompetitive organizations like government agencies, laws often ban nepotistic hiring. On the other hand, the government allows the market to police competitive firms. If a CEO promotes Junior and he turns out to be inept, well, the firm pays the price in lost profits.
<P>
Our country is probably several years away from even beginning to grasp this logic, but in the long run it may prove compelling. Conservatives, however, can't seize the rational high ground until they stop leaping to defend institutions they, especially, should be wary of -- e.g., unions, regulated monopolies, and government agencies -- against the threat of racial quotas. True, competition does restrain irrational discrimination. But where competition is lacking -- such as in government monopolies like police and fire departments, or in labor unions, which exist to negate competition -- then quotas can sometimes be necessary to put a price on discrimination.

NEW YORK, MARCH 12
<P>
Impatient right-minded reformers are whispering to themselves that the Gingrich GOP has run out of steam, and they are quite right about that. The big parade is stalled out there as people leave to look in on the primaries. Last week's action/inaction on regulatory reform was an attempt at a quick revival, but it didn't work. 
<P>
The idea was based on something that didn't happen about twenty years ago. The idea of it is ``sunset legislation.'' An example of the kind of thing Mr. Gingrich has had in mind inflames the memory. 
<P>
The story goes back to the early Fifties, when former President Herbert Hoover was asked by President Truman to recommend reforms that would retire useless government ventures. The Hoover Commission went to work and made a number of recommendations, but one of them sticks in the mind. During the Civil War, the British Navy quarantine threatened the import of hemp needed by the Union Army. So . . . something like a synthetic fiber was developed to make certain that the army should not run out. 
<P>
The Civil War ended in 1864. In 1951, Mr. Hoover's scouts discovered that the hemp factory was still operating in a little town in Massachusetts, never mind that hemp had been available on open markets for nearly ninety years. It employed about ninety hemp workers, and Mr. Hoover marked it down for execution. But Senator John F. Kennedy interceded: He did not wish any Massachusetts enterprise to be hurt. Mr. Hoover sent an emissary to Kennedy: How about agreeing that anyone who retired from work in the Civil War Massachusetts Emergency Hemp Factory should not be replaced? That way, the factory would die of old age in a little while. The answer from JFK: No. For all we know, they are still making hemp in Massachusetts, with a government subsidy, at twice the cost of the other stuff. 
<P>
About twenty years ago, the idea of sunset legislation had a very strong run. Its primary enthusiast was Senator Charles Percy, a Republican from Illinois. The idea was that every ten years, a given regulatory agency would report to Congress on what it was doing and how much it was spending. The Executive would then recommend changes in that agency's activity. Congress would ponder those recommended changes, and adopt them or not. If they were not adopted, the agency would -- expire, at the end of that congressional session. Assuming that every agency of government were reviewed and disapproved, in ten years there would be none left; no, not even the agency that had kept alive the hemp makers in Massachusetts. 
<P>
A version of that was sought by the Gingrich Contract, which borrowed the old sunset idea about existing regulations but put it on a seven-year cycle. A year ago, the House leadership sought a moratorium on new federal rules along with a demand that proposed new rules give an accounting estimate of how much they would cost, and how much they should effect. 
<P>
This year, under the kind of inertial pressure that the Clinton White House has become so effective in generating, the leadership retreated from the robust bill that would have included all regulatory agencies to something more modest, more tentative. Wearily, that was sent back to the drawing board, where a paler version is asked for. 
<P>
Mr. Gingrich's offensive is the great casualty of the Republican primary campaign, which has had a dissolute effect on Republican purpose. The call for a flat tax is bracing and interesting in itself. The call for protective tariffs, for some sort of intervention to guard against corporate downsizing -- all these have had the effect of diverting attention from a job that might well have been done without the primaries to absorb public interest and energy. 
<P>
It will all be fine for the GOP if the downsizing of the Contract with America has merely meant that the gestation of an effective political program is taking longer than envisioned. Reformers will not complain if, a year from now, President Dole signs one after another of the bills sent to him by a Republican Congress. Yes, if you had some ham we could have a ham sandwich, if I had some bread. 
<P>
The Republicans have a great deal to do to re-energize a Congress that so inspirited the country as recently as 14 months ago. A good beginning would be for Messrs. Buchanan and Forbes to call it a day.

<LI>Free-market fanatics, which emphatically includes us, are disturbed by Patrick J. Buchanan's heretical revival of the American tradition of tariffs. Of course, we have to admit that tariffs are just another form of tax. Arguably, they would result in no more misallocation than the enormous onslaught of taxation that has taken federal revenues from below 5 per cent of GDP under Calvin Coolidge to almost 20 per cent under Bill Clinton, without too much libertarian uproar. But meanwhile we have another question: Why has no one -- for example, his fans at the Cato Institute -- noticed that Steve Forbes is committing an even greater heresy against free-market writ? He is reviving another American policy tradition, that of the currency crank. He wants to abandon floating exchange rates (the prescription and lifetime achievement of Milton Friedman), fix the U.S. dollar against gold at a high rate, and resist any and all pressures to let the dollar depreciate (``trashing the dollar,'' in Forbes-speak). This, of course, would mean periodically closing down the economy to reduce imports and generate a dollar-bolstering current account-surplus -- the celebrated ``stop - go'' effect that crippled Britain in the 1960s. That's apparently OK with Mr. Forbes, who seems to view a ``strong dollar'' as an end in itself. But his ``strong dollar'' would also make American products more expensive in foreign markets -- and foreign products cheaper in American markets. Amazingly, Steve Forbes intends to subsidize imports and tax exports -- across the board. He's a protectionist too -- an inverted protectionist. Ed Crane, call your office.

<LI>ANNALS OF EXTREMISM. ``By forcefully raising the issue of economic vulnerability, Buchanan pushes the whole debate to the left. A month ago, the issues were budget balance and the flat tax. Today they are corporate greed and working-class wages. Thank you, Pat. . . . Now that Pat Buchanan has demonstrated that economic fears equal political pay dirt, we can expect Democrats . . . to begin speaking with a bolder voice. It's about time.'' -- Robert Kuttner, Boston Globe. Looks like ``flirting with socialism'' to us.

Before taking up the cause of Powell, Ditzhazy had been chief of intelligence and counterintelligence for the Southeast Michigan Militia. . . . When I asked what was the connection between maneuvering in the woods out of fear that the government might go tyrannically haywire and campaigning for a lifelong Pentagon/Beltway insider, Ditzhazy praised Powell's 'integrity and moral courage' . . .'' -- Richard Brookhiser, in a piece on the Powell book tour in Forbes FYI. Powell never made it from author to candidate. But if he had, surely America would have been entitled to ask why militiamen were attracted to his campaign.

Anyone who thinks that the Democrats are really reconciled to the end of the era of big government should look at congressional Democratic proposals to address worker anxiety. Much of their agenda, outlined by House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, is standard Democratic fare: ``fair trade,'' more spending on education and training programs, health-insurance regulation, pressure on the Fed to ease up on inflation. But the centerpiece of Gephardt's proposal -- and of legislation sponsored by Sens. Daschle and Bingaman -- is financial incentives (tax breaks, government contracts, pension-fund investments) for ``corporate citizenship.'' Essentially, the Federal Government will bribe companies to operate little welfare states for their employees. Companies will be rewarded for not laying people off, for offering generous non-wage benefits, and for unionizing. This bold new idea is in fact corporatist socialism, a very old idea with roots in medieval guilds. Democrats offer these regressive proposals because their analyses of the economy's problems focus on huge bureaucratic corporations like AT&T. In fact, the health of small businesses and the number of new business start-ups are vastly more important than the health of a few mega-corporations. There is reason for concern about the economy: family incomes and wages have been stagnant in the Nineties, and, as Alan Reynolds points out, the seven ``fat years'' of the Reagan expansion have been followed by seven ``lean years'' under Bush and Clinton. But this anemic growth is largely the result of specific mistakes: e.g., tax and welfare policies that discourage people from seeking work. Americans' economic anxieties can be addressed by reversing those mistakes: by cutting taxes and regulations. House Majority Leader Dick Armey gave a fine speech along these lines the same day Rep. Gephardt spoke. We hope Sen. Dole -- and Mr. Buchanan -- were listening to the right speech.

On February 29, Federal District Court Judge Louis Oberdorfer threw out the suit brought by the Federal Election Commission against GOPAC. The FEC admitted that GOPAC gave no money to federal candidates, Newt Gingrich included. Still, it claimed that efforts to organize state and local GOP groups and to shape the national agenda were actually sneaky, unregistered attempts to affect federal elections. According to the FEC, any attempt to affect politics or issues at any level falls under the control of the FEC. Judge Oberdorfer said, No way. The get-Newt crowd spun into overdrive. David Bonior filed another ethics charge against Gingrich rehashing the FEC charge; the still-taxpayer-funded National Public Radio expressed dismay that the judge would let GOPAC beat the rap for ``secretly'' raising millions of dollars to engineer a Republican takeover of Congress. Next on NPR: Gingrich's New World Order?

NATIONAL REVIEW's call to reconsider a failed drug war has not exactly been embraced on the presidential hustings. That is no surprise -- politicians respond only to deep-seated shifts in opinion. But a gradual shift on the drug war continues: Richard E. Neville, a Chicago Criminal Court judge, became the latest law-enforcement figure to say: Enough is enough. High profits bring ``ten replacements'' for every drug offender imprisoned. ``No matter how many we put in jail, that isn't going to stop. . . . It's a revolving door that has continued for thirty years, and will continue until we change the policy.''

In Australia's elections -- a decisive defeat for Labor -- the main campaign issues were youth unemployment and immigrants on welfare. John Howard, the new conservative prime minister, campaigned on dismantling the system of lavish ``retraining'' and high minimum wages, which produces unemployment of 30 per cent among 16-to-21-year-olds. Howard also promised to extend from six months to two years the waiting period for immigrants to be eligible for welfare. But some of the biggest electoral upsets suggested that there's an even tougher-minded brand of conservatism in the outback. Labor's Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Robert Tickner, a loud champion of all kinds of superstitious native land claims, lost his seat in a 14 per cent swing. Graeme Campbell, a Labor MP expelled from the party for his attacks on multiculturalism, won re-election as an independent. And in the fastest-growing state, Queensland, another rebel won -- conservative Pauline Hanson, who stirred up the media by saying that campaigners for aboriginal land rights were ``only interested in money.'' Disowned by the frightened establishment, including Howard, as a ``racist,'' she lost her party support but won her race handsomely, also running as an independent. The Australian electorate wanted straight talk on taboo issues, and the more politically incorrect the better. Sound familiar?

Minister Louis Farrakhan made a One Man March through Africa and the Middle East, strewing bouquets everywhere he went. In Iran, he addressed crowds that were chanting, ``Death to America''; in Libya, he was promised a billion-dollar (sic) loan from Col. Qaddafi; in Iraq, he called UN sanctions ``mass murder'' and a ``crime against humanity''; in Nigeria, he compared Gen. Sani Abacha, the local tyrant, to Moses. He also visited the Sudan, where (black) slaves can be had for $15. Teach, brother! All of which led Eric Breindel of the New York Post to an interesting point. Pat Buchanan is supported by Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of America, who has shared podiums with racist kooks. Bill Clinton is supported by former Rep. Kweisi Mfume, who, as head of the Congressional Black Caucus, made a ``sacred covenant'' with Louis Farrakhan. Pratt, called on his behavior, denounced kookery. Mfume, not called on anything, maintains a profound silence. Pratt and Buchanan are Bad Men. Mfume and Clinton are -- what?

Before 1970, one member of a divorcing couple had to be shown to be at fault. After 1970, states began allowing divorce merely on the grounds of ``irreconcilable differences.'' Divorce rates shot up, and there arose the phenomenon of impoverished, mostly middle-aged women whose husbands had abandoned them for fresher prospects. In California, divorced women on average suffer a 73 per cent decline in standard of living. Their former husbands suffer more subtle woes. Lately, state legislators in Iowa, Michigan, Illinois, Idaho, Pennsylvania, and Georgia have been talking about reinstating the older criteria for granting divorces. But the lawmakers face an uphill battle. As Janet Daley has pointed out in the London Daily Telegraph, no-fault divorce arises from a common intellectual assumption: that social institutions should be judged according to whether they retard or advance ``personal liberation.'' By this standard, marriage becomes just a love affair which, when it ceases to satisfy one partner, may be dissolved. If it is to be at all meaningful, says Miss Daley, marriage must be more than that: ``a public act of commitment [to] the wider community: the extended family, future offspring, perhaps the Church, and society at large.'' What is needed is not just a legal counterrevolution but a philosophical one.

Americans are conducting the sixth presidential election campaign since the Supreme Court decreed a virtually unlimited ``right'' to abortion in Roe v. Wade and its companion case, Doe v. Bolton. Over the past 23 years, the abortion debate has been about abortion, of course; but it has also been a debate about the kind of society America is and seeks to be. Throughout our national history, few issues have so sharply focused attention on the fundamental purposes of the American democratic experiment. For, in the abortion debate, we are required to confront an urgent moral issue: Who is to be included in the community of the commonly protected?<BR>
The following statement of principle, endorsed by a broad spectrum of pro-life organizational leaders and scholars, is the result of consultations held over the past several months at the Ethics and Public Policy Center in Washington, D.C. The statement aims to clarify the principles on which the pro-life movement stands, to articulate a pro-life vision of the American future, and to suggest a set of political, legal, and cultural strategies that are capable of translating that vision into reality. The signatories, who join the statement as individuals, offer this statement to the public in the hope that it will raise the level of public discourse on this highly controversial issue, and thus strengthen American democracy. The signatories are deeply grateful to NATIONAL REVIEW for opening its pages to their ideas and concerns.

<FONT SIZE=+3>T</FONT>WENTY-THREE years after the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton decisions, the conscience of the American people remains deeply troubled by the practice of abortion on demand. Because of these two decisions, abortion is legal at any time of pregnancy, for virtually any reason, in every state. This constitutes an almost completely unrestricted private license to judge who will live and who will die.
<P>
That America has the most permissive abortion regime among the world's democracies is a betrayal of the American promise of justice for all. That is why a new sense of moral concern is stirring throughout our country in this election year. That is why millions of Americans have refused to accept the Court's 1992 admonition in Planned Parenthood v. Casey to stop debating the issue.
<P>
2. To those weary of this argument, it may seem that there is nothing more to be said on the matter of abortion. We disagree.
<P>
Survey research tells us that the American people do not want a legal regime of abortion on demand for any reason, at any time during a pregnancy. We believe we have an obligation to employ the arts of democratic persuasion to help reinstitute legal protection for all unborn children.
<P>
The extent of the abortion license and its reach into other areas of law and public policy is widely underestimated. We believe that, as citizens of the United States, we have the responsibility to discuss with our fellow citizens the facts of the abortion license and its impact on our common life.
<P>
Many women in crisis earnestly seek alternatives to abortion. We believe we ought to encourage those alternatives and help to provide them.
<P>
3. Pro-life service to women in crisis and pro-life advocacy on behalf of legal reform are expressions of our highest ideals as citizens of the United States. We affirm the nobility of the American democratic experiment in ordered liberty. We affirm the rule of law and the principle of equal protection under the law, even as we work to reform constitutional and statutory law so that the American legal system is, once again, congruent with the Founders' claim that the inalienable right to life is one of the great moral truths on which American democracy rests. We want an America that is open, hospitable, and caring -- a community of civic friendship in which neighbors reach out to assist neighbors in distress.
<P>
4. The abortion license has helped to erode the moral foundations of the American civic community. Right now we are not the country we ought to be. That is why our national conscience is troubled. That distress is, to us, a sign of moral vitality. We speak now because we seek to defend the America we love. We speak to promote the cause of an America in which women and men, together, rebuild the fabric of civil society by acknowledging our common responsibility to serve and protect the weakest and most vulnerable among us. We speak for a rebirth of freedom in these United States: a freedom that finds its fulfillment in goodness.
<P>
<H3>Victims of the License</H3>
<P>
5. Americans of every race, economic condition, religion, and political persuasion share a common concern today for what some have called a national ``virtue deficit.'' As a country, we have not paid sufficient attention to nurturing those habits of heart and mind that make democratic self-governance possible and that undergird what the Framers of the Constitution called ``civic virtue.'' We believe that the abortion license is a critical factor in America's virtue deficit.
<P>
6. Abortion kills 1.5 million innocent human beings in America every year. There is no longer any serious scientific dispute that the unborn child is a human creature who dies violently in the act of abortion. This brute fact is the root of our national distress over the abortion license. Abortion kills: few would now deny that. But in order to defend the private ``right'' to lethal violence that is the essence of abortion, proponents of the license frequently resort to euphemisms like ``products of conception'' and ``the termination of pregnancy.''
<P>
The public dialogue is not coarsened by depictions of the reality of abortion. But a coarsening of our common life has taken place; it is evident in the lack of moral revulsion that follows one newspaper's accurate description of an abortion procedure that ``breaks . . . apart'' the ``fetus'' before ``it'' is ``suctioned out of the uterus'' or ``extracted.'' 
<P>
7. The abortion license hurts women. Some (including the narrow Supreme Court majority in the 1992 Casey decision) contend that the license is necessary to ensure social and economic gains for women. It is ever more clear, though, that women pay a huge price for abortion. By providing an alleged technological ``fix'' for unintended pregnancy, the license has encouraged widespread male irresponsibility and predatory male sexual behavior. Abortion-on-demand has given an excuse to a man who shirks his responsibilities, claiming that the child he helped to conceive ought to have been aborted, or that the woman who declined to abort may not impose on him any responsibility for her ``lifestyle choice.''
<P>
Fathers have also been harmed and dehumanized by the abortion license. Some watch their children killed against their will; others learn to their distress only much later that a child they would have raised is dead. Even when agreeing to support the abortion decision, fathers, like mothers, suppress their grief, deny their protective instincts, and otherwise damage themselves when they allow the killing of their own children. Abortion contributes to the marginalization of fatherhood in America, which many agree is a primary cause of the alarming breakdown of American family life. 
<P>
The license has thus poisoned relationships between women and men, even as it has done serious harm to the thousands of women who now suffer from the effects of post-abortion grief. The women of America do not need abortion to be full participants in our society. To suggest otherwise is to demean women, to further distort relationships between women and men, and to aggravate the difficulties of re-creating in America a community of virtue and mutual responsibility.
<P>
<H3>The Public Dimension</H3>
<P>
8. Abortion is not simply a matter of private ``choice.'' Rather, the abortion license cuts to the heart of America's claim to being a law-governed democracy, in which equality before the law is a fundamental principle of justice.  The abortion license also threatens the cultural foundations of our democratic political community. For if it becomes a settled matter in American law and in American public morality that there is, in fact, a private ``right'' to use lethal violence to ``solve'' personal, family, or social problems, then the claim of American democracy to be an expression of the people's commitment to ``establish justice'' will be undermined, just as it was when the law claimed the ``right'' to exclude certain Americans from its full protection on the basis of race. Thus the abortion issue is the crucial civil-rights issue of our time.
<P>
9. A sweeping abortion license was defined unilaterally by the Supreme Court without recourse to the normal procedures of democratic debate and legislation. This in itself wounded American democracy. And the Court's persistent refusal to permit the American people to debate the basic issue of an alleged ``right to abortion'' in their legislatures continues to damage our democracy by alienating tens of millions of Americans from their institutions of government.
<P>
10. The Court's definition of a ``right to abortion'' -- first enunciated as a ``privacy right,'' then as a ``liberty right'' under the Fourteenth Amendment -- has had other damaging effects. The language of ``rights'' puts the dilemma of unwanted pregnancy into a legal-adversarial context, pitting mother against child, and even father against mother. But as the common experience of humanity -- and, increasingly, the findings of science -- demonstrates, what hurts one party in this most intimate of human relationships hurts both parties. The America we seek is an America in which both mother and child are the subjects of our concern and our community's protection. To abuse the language of ``rights'' in this matter further advances the demeaning practice of reducing all human relationships in America to matters of adversarial adjudication. This is a prescription for democratic decay. For democracy rests on the foundations of civil society, and in a truly civil society, relationships between people have a far richer moral texture than that suggested by adversarial procedure.
<P>
11. The Court's vain attempt to justify the abortion license in terms of an all-encompassing right of personal autonomy has begun to infect other areas of the law. Thus the ``autonomy'' logic of the Court's 1992 Casey decision is now invoked as a warrant for a constitutional ``right'' to euthanasia. And if it were followed to its conclusion, this logic would require us to consider such profound human relationships as the bond between husband and wife, or the bond between parents and children, to be nothing more than matters of contract, with the claims of the autonomous individual trumping all other claims. Enshrined by the Court to legalize abortion on demand, this autonomy logic threatens to give us an America in which the only actors of consequence are the individual and the state; no other community, including the community of husband and wife, or the community of parents and children, will have effective constitutional standing.
<P>
12. The Supreme Court's insistence on a ``right'' to abortion has had other disturbing effects on our public life. This ``right'' has been used to justify the abridgment of First Amendment free-speech rights, as when sidewalk counselors are threatened with legal penalties for proposing protection and care to women in crisis at the crucial moment of decision outside an abortion clinic. This ``right'' has been used by the Federal Government to coerce state governments into providing abortions, even when state legislatures or popular referenda have clearly registered the people's unwillingness to use public funds for elective abortions. The abortion ``right'' has distorted our national health-care debate, as well as the debate over welfare reform. It has even had an impact on U.S. foreign policy. American attempts to impose the ``right'' on the rest of the world at the 1994 Cairo world conference on population and the 1995 Beijing world conference on women have been deeply resented by other countries, as have U.S. attempts to promote abortion overseas through foreign aid.
<P>
13. The Court's attempt to define a ``right'' to abortion has polarized institutions and professions that were once among the bulwarks of American civil society. Professional associations of lawyers, academics, teachers, and civil servants have been divided by attempts to enlist their resources and prestige in support of abortion on demand, and in opposition to any effort to regulate abortion even in ways held constitutional by the Supreme Court. The medical profession has been deeply divided over its relationship to the abortion license. That the practice of abortion on demand is now widely recognized within the medical community as contradictory to the most deeply held values of the profession of healing is, we believe, a sign of hope. Yet some medical groups now threaten to reverse this trend by coercion -- for example, by requiring medical residency programs to teach and perform abortion techniques. There are also disturbing signs of the corrupting influence of the abortion license in other professions. History has been rewritten to provide specious justification for Roe v. Wade. The teaching of law has been similarly distorted, as have political theory and political science. Such extremism underlines the unavoidably public character of the abortion license. The abortion license has a perverse Midas quality -- it corrupts whatever it touches.
<P>
<H3>The Way Ahead</H3>
<P>
14. Our goal is simply stated: we seek an America in which every unborn child is protected in law and welcomed in life. Legal reform and cultural renewal must both take place if America is to experience a new birth of the freedom that is ordered to goodness. We have just described, in this statement, the nature, sources, and dimension of our concern. Now, as pro-life leaders and scholars, we want to propose a program of action which we believe will appeal to Americans with open minds and hearts on this issue.
<P>
15. Means are always available to enable women to overcome the burdens that can accompany pregnancy and child-rearing. There are always alternatives to abortion. The legacy of Roe v. Wade involves a massive denial of this truth and a deformation of social attitudes and practices so pervasive that women are actually encouraged to have abortions as the ``easier'' road to the goals that an unexpected pregnancy appears to threaten. As individuals and as a society, we bear a common responsibility to make sure that all women know that their own physical and spiritual resources, joined to those of a society that truly affirms and welcomes life, are sufficient to overcome whatever obstacles pregnancy and child-rearing may appear to present. Women instinctively know, and we should never deny, that this path will involve sacrifice. But this sacrifice must no longer remain a one-way street. In particular, men must also assume their proper share of the responsibilities that family life -- indeed, civilization itself -- requires.
<P>
16. The pro-life movement must redouble its efforts to provide alternatives to abortion for women in crisis. There are now over 3,000 pregnancy-care centers in the United States, providing medical, educational, financial, and spiritual assistance to women who, facing the dilemma of a crisis pregnancy, bravely choose to carry their unborn children to term. We support an expansion of this service to our neighbors, so that by the turn of the century what we believe to be true today has become unmistakably clear to every American woman: No one in the United States has to have an abortion.
<P>
17. The overwhelming majority of Americans believe that adoption is preferable to abortion. We must streamline and simplify the legal procedures involved in adoption, while providing effective support to those married couples who choose to adopt. 
<P>
18. The abortion license is inextricably bound up with the mores of the sexual revolution. Promotion of the pro-life cause also requires us to support and work with those who are seeking to re-establish the moral linkage between sexual expression and marriage, and between marriage and procreation. We believe that a renewal of American democracy as a virtuous society requires us to honor and promote an ethic of self-command and mutual responsibility, and to resist the siren song of the false ethic of unbridled self-expression. 
<P>
19. Service to women in crisis, the promotion of adoption, and the restoration of sound sexual morality are essential if we are to experience a national cultural renewal that will help to sustain legal reform of the abortion license. The way in which we pursue the latter is also crucial, both to cultural renewal and legal reform.
<P>
We pledge ourselves to exercise the arts of democratic persuasion in advancing our legal agenda. We urge Congress and the courts to reconsider their ill-advised restrictions on the rights of pro-life activists.
<P>
We unequivocally reject the use of violence in the pro-life cause as contrary to the central moral principles of our movement. For more than 23 years, we have worked within the democratic process to advance the protection of all innocent human life, and we will continue to do so. 
<P>
20. The unborn child in America today enjoys less legal protection than an endangered species of bird in a national forest. In this situation, we believe a broad-based legal and political strategy is essential. There are many steps to be taken on the road to an America in which every unborn child is protected in law and welcomed in life. Thus we find no contradiction between a rigorous adherence to our ultimate goal and the pursuit of reforms that advance us toward that goal. Legal reforms that fall short of our goal, but that help move us toward it, save lives and aid in the process of moral and cultural renewal. 
<P>
21. In its 1992 Casey decision, the Supreme Court agreed that the State of Pennsylvania could regulate the abortion industry in a number of ways. These regulations do not afford any direct legal protection to the unborn child. Yet experience has shown that such regulations -- genuine informed consent, waiting periods, parental notification -- reduce abortions in a locality, especially when coupled with positive efforts to promote alternatives to abortion and service to women in crisis. A national effort to enact Pennsylvania-type regulations in all fifty states would be a modest but important step toward the America we seek. 
<P>
22. Congress also has the opportunity to contribute to legal reform of the abortion license. A number of proposals are now being debated in the Congress, including bans on certain methods of abortion and restrictions on federal funding of abortions. We believe that Congress should adopt these measures and that the President should sign them into law. Any criminal sanctions considered in such legislation should fall upon abortionists, not upon women in crisis. We further urge the discussion of means by which Congress could recognize the unborn child as a human person entitled to the protection of the Constitution. 
<P>
23. The right to life of the unborn will not be secured until it is secure under the Constitution of the United States. As it did in Brown v. Board of Education (when it rejected the Plessy v. Ferguson doctrine of ``separate but equal'' as an adequate expression of rights secured under the Fourteenth Amendment), the Supreme Court could reject the ``central finding'' of Roe v. Wade, that abortion on demand is required by an unenumerated ``right to privacy'' protected in part by the Fourteenth Amendment. The claim that such a correction of error would damage the Court's authority is belied by the experience of Brown v. Board of Education, and by the fact that the Court has corrected its own erroneous interpretations of the Constitution on scores of other occasions.
<P>
A more enduring means of constitutional reform is a constitutional amendment both reversing the doctrines of Roe v. Wade and Casey, and establishing that the right to life protected by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments extends to the unborn child. Such an amendment would have to be ratified by three-fourths of the states: a requirement that underlines the importance of establishing a track record of progressive legal change on behalf of the unborn child at the state and local levels.
<P>
Even with a constitutional amendment, every path to the protection and welcome we seek for unborn children requires the re-empowerment of the people of the United States and their elected representatives to debate and resolve the specific statutory enactments that will govern the question of abortion. A constitutional amendment, in other words, is not a self-executing instrument that will end the debate on abortion. It will, rather, correct a gross misinterpretation of the Constitution (as was required to reverse the grievous errors of the Dred Scott decision) and require states to debate and adopt policies that do not violate the unborn child's right to life.
<P>
Such a process does not, we emphasize, amount to the determination of moral truth by majority rule. Rather, it requires conforming fundamental constitutional principle to a fundamental moral truth -- that abortion is the unwarranted taking of an innocent human life. Such a process also respects the role of representative government in fashioning policies that will ultimately secure that principle in practice. The project of constitutional reform on this issue, as on the precedent issues of slavery and segregation, is to bring our legal system into congruence with basic moral truths about the human person.
<P>
<H3>An Appeal to Our Neighbors</H3>
<P>
24. We believe the pro-life cause is an expression of the premise and promise of American democracy. The premise is that we are all created equal; the promise is that there is justice for all. For all the reasons cited above, the abortion license has done grave damage to America: it has killed tens of millions of unborn children, caused untold anguish to their mothers, and marginalized fathers in our society. The renewal of American democracy according to the highest ideals of the Founders requires us to stand for the inalienable right to life of the unborn, to stand with women in crisis, and to stand against the abortion license.
<P>
25. Few Americans celebrate the abortion license today. For many who are troubled by the license and its impact on our society, to be ``reluctantly pro-choice'' is now thought to be the responsible position. We respectfully urge those of our neighbors who hold that position to reconsider. We ask them to ponder the relationship between the abortion license and the crisis of family life in America. We ask them to reconsider whether radical autonomy is a sufficient understanding of freedom. We ask them to reflect, again, on the morality of abortion itself. We ask them to think about the social impact of a legally defined private ``right'' to lethal violence. 
<P>
We ask them to ask themselves: ``Is American society, today, more hospitable, caring, and responsible than it was before Roe v. Wade?'' We believe the answer is ``No.'' Problems that the proponents of abortion claimed the license would help alleviate -- such as childhood poverty, illegitimacy, and child abuse -- have in fact gotten worse, throughout every level of our society, since Roe v. Wade. Thus we respectfully ask our neighbors to consider the possibility of a connection -- cultural as well as legal -- between the virtue deficit in contemporary American life and the abortion license.
<P>
26. The pro-life movement is about affirmation. Thus we ask our neighbors, of whatever political persuasion or current conviction on the matter of abortion, to engage in a great national debate about the America we seek, and the relationship of the abortion license to that future. We ask all Americans to join with us in providing effective, compassionate service to women in crisis. Work on alternatives to abortion and on the reform of adoption laws and procedures can create the conditions for a new dialogue on the future of abortion law and practice in America. We are ready for that new conversation. We invite all our neighbors to join us.

Dear Rusty,
<P>
This is going to be a quick one. Little Al and I are conducting an experiment, and I can't take too much time from it.
<P>
We're watching television. We've been glued to the set since seven o'clock this morning, and we're going to try to watch until dinnertime. 
<P>It was Little Al's idea. ``Dad,'' he said, ``you talk a lot about all the bad stuff that's on TV, but I don't think I've ever seen anything bad on TV.'' 
<P>``You have an excellent point, son,'' I said. I haven't had much time to really sit in front of the set and ``vege'' out, as the kids say. Bill and I have been too busy leading the nation and supervising AmeriCorps. But after the White House Summit of leaders in the television industry, well, I knew I was a little bit behind. In the first place, I'm not really sure who the Friends are -- though I'm pretty sure I don't want Little Al to know either. But the minute it came up in the conference, Bill just lit up: ``Oh yeah -- love that show,'' he said, ``we ought to get Jennifer Aniston involved in this -- we ought to get her to come to the White House.''
<P>``Can do, Mr. President,'' said Bob Wright, the head of NBC. ``We'll get the whole dang cast of Friends and ER right here to salute you in the wisdom you have shown by not auctioning the remaining spectrum.''
<P>``Just Jennifer, okay?''
<P>``As you wish, sir,'' Wright said, ``and insofar as the spectrum auction is concerned -- ''
<P>Just then, Bob Iger, the head of ABC/Cap Cities, hustled over. ``Mr. President,'' he said, ``about this ratings idea -- is there some wiggle room here?'' 
<P>``I'm not sure I understand the question,'' Bill said. 
<P>``Well, now, take a show like NYPD Blue, okay? What I'm saying is, on that show -- which airs pretty darn late, nine or ten o'clock -- sometimes we'll show -- strictly in context, you understand -- how do I put this delicately?'' 
<P>``You show that fat guy's naked hindquarters.''
<P>``Yes, sir. Exactly. Okay, we're all on the same page here.''
<P>``And I think you shouldn't be allowed to show that. If you absolutely must, then you should rate the show 'adults only,' and the V-chip, which I proposed in my State of the Union message -- ''
<P>Iger looked taken aback. ``Gosh, sir,'' he said, ``I was about to ask if we'd be out of line to once in a while show the naked top half of a feisty young policewoman, but if you're dead set against -- ''
<P>``Let me finish,'' Bill said. The ``V-chip, and a set of ratings, should not be imposed without careful consideration.''
<P>``I've got an idea!'' Bob Iger exclaimed. ``What if the ratings were voluntary?'' 
<P>``I love it!'' Bill cried.
<P>Peter Lund, the head of CBS, pushed over. ``And the V-chip could be removable!'' he shouted. 
<P>``Or,'' Bill added thoughtfully, ``it could have an on-off switch hidden somewhere so your wife couldn't tell.'' 
<P>``Better,'' Lund said. 
<P>I was happy that the meetings were going so well. Bill and I are going to need the support of the television industry. They have a sacred duty to use the airwaves responsibly. In a way, they should treat the people's airwaves with the same care that we treat the people's money. I made a mental note to pass this analogy on to Bill for use on the campaign trail. 
<P>``So, what?'' I heard Bill say to Bob Iger as they headed to lunch. ``She'll be, like, in bed or something and then suddenly sit up or roll over?'' 
<P>``Or she could be in the shower, Mr. President, toweling off.''
<P>``Yeah, yeah, I see how that could be contextual.'' 
<P>``Totally. Totally contextual.''
<P>``And you could just kind of reach around and click off that V-chip -- ''
<P>``Just click it off, Mr. President,'' Iger agreed.
<P>``Could you make that V-chip go three ways? You know, on, off, and a setting where . . .''
<P>``Where if she dropped the towel . . . ?''
<P>``Yeah, exactly. Exactly.''
<P>``Mr. President, I see no reason why not. The era of big government is over. Let the era of big entertainment begin.''
<P>So here I am, channel surfing. And let me tell you, there are a lot of programs on in the middle of the day that are totally unfit for children. I caught Little Al watching a program that included the most shockingly explicit sexual descriptions. Granted, it was the opening arguments of the Paula Jones sexual harassment suit on Court TV, but -- in the middle of the day? I made Little Al switch to an old Western. A gunfight is easier to explain.
<P>
Your Pal,  Al

NEW YORK, FEBRUARY 23
<P>

The New Hampshire event throws light primarily on Pat Buchanan even though, at only a point or two ahead of Senator Dole, his victory was nominal. The exhilaration was there, bringing to mind that of Senator Eugene McCarthy in 1968 when even though he did not defeat the sitting President, he came close enough (at 42 per cent) to electrocute Lyndon Johnson. A few weeks later, Johnson announced that he would not run for re-election. What has the Buchanan vote in New Hampshire told his own party?
<P>
This is not instantly clear, because many of his positions are also held by other contestants. Steve Forbes is not the original flat-tax man, but he is the flat tax's primary champion -- Buchanan, with this or the other modification, agrees. On turning functions over to the states and, where possible, to individuals, Buchanan's position is also that of Lamar Alexander. Senator Dole took a strong stand against the degeneracy of Hollywood and so pleased the social conservatives, to whom Mr. Buchanan speaks eloquently. Buchanan is isolated from the others on two matters, one specific, the other general. He would repeal the two treaties that commit us to free trade, NAFTA and GATT. And he would adopt an isolationist foreign policy. The other three would not. 
<P>
And yet when Mr. Buchanan speaks of his candidacy he singles it out as entirely unique, a messianic episode. And there is a sense in which he is correct. These things are not up for arithmetical measurement. Suppose one reasonably predicted that on ten positions involving public issues, Buchanan and Alexander (or Dole) would vote the same way on eight. Does that make them in the long perspective indistinguishable?
<P>
The answer is, No. Because Buchanan is a figure whose persona overwhelms the political grid. In Houston in 1992 he declared that the United States was engaged in a war to the death between two cultures, the traditional and the countercultural. Many thought him correct (I do), but his tone was not that of Abraham Lincoln, but that of John Brown. The afflatus is historically distinguished and honored, and as often as not the prophet is martyred. He is seldom brought on, like Churchill, to act as leader. 
<P>
There is another question, a matter of public and moral psychology. There are those Americans (again, I include myself) who believe that the isolationist temptation, both politically and economically, is a temptation most fiercely to be avoided, since its implications can be lethal. Although I do not believe for one minute that, if he were President, Mr. Buchanan would actually rush to dismantle NATO (any more than I believe that if Dole were President he would immediately balance the budget), the fact is that Buchanan said exactly that. The go-it-alone insularity is reflected in his economic nostrum for demoralized American workingmen: Blame foreigners. Charge the Japanese 10 per cent on imports, the Chinese 20 per cent. 
<P>
The political conundrum looms, as such wise men as there are in Republican politics acknowledge one thing, namely that there would not be much point in nominating Pat Buchanan with the mission of dispossessing President Clinton, since that is inconceivable. Buchanan is a prophet, not a king. That being so, practical men will pause over how exactly to handle the phenomenon. The memory of George Wallace comes to mind. In 1968 his popular strength was critical: he more or less owned the South, and he had a large following among hardhats in the industrial Midwest. But the Democrats were moving sharply left just then and had no time for him or for conservative Democrats in general. He avenged himself by running as an independent candidate, securing 13.5 per cent of the vote, and ensuring the election of Richard Nixon. Wallace's followers voted Republican for the next twenty years.
<P>
The challenge is to detach from Buchanan that in his campaign which the Republican Party ought to concern itself with, and be grateful to him for giving it focus. Buchanan almost singlehandedly revitalized moral political sentiment on the matter of abortion. His call for a national acknowledgment of a common culture has as its symbol a vote against Bilingual America. His earnest suspicion of predatory government is repeated by other candidates, but they are toothless in their language by comparison. The sheer joy with which Buchanan takes his positions is -- a joy to hear. A long night with the master cheerleader. 
<P>
It will end in a few weeks, and then Republicans need to hope that the idealistic imperative of replacing Mr. Clinton will generate the necessary poultices, and mobilize the common will; which requires reorienting America in the general direction fought for by Pat Buchanan.

<LI>``Anonymous'' has a new novel in the works about the Gramm campaign. Working title: Colorless Primary.
<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI>How's this for a bizarre twist: Phil Gramm is a Bob Dole supporter. The Gramm campaign -- predictably -- couldn't recover from the wound inflicted on it by Pat Buchanan in Louisiana. But in many ways it was self-inflicted. The foray into Louisiana -- fertile territory for New World Order-baiting Buchanan -- was misconceived from the start, a too-clever attempt to get a contrived bounce into Iowa, where, ironically, Gramm was doing just fine prior to his bayou debacle. There were other more fundamental problems with the campaign as well: its failure to court social conservatives vigorously or early enough; its myopic focus on ``ready cash'' (the campaign foolishly discounted Buchanan because he didn't have it); Gramm's unsympathetic public persona. But, all that said, Gramm looked like the candidate best suited to unite the rapidly parting economic and social wings of the conservative movement. The GOP had better find another, or Gramm won't be the only loser.
<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI>Dr. Jack Kevorkian was prevented from assisting in another suicide when police stopped him at the entrance to RNC headquarters.<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI>This year, as in past years, the Iowa caucuses were marked by appeals to the state's many religious conservatives. Sadly, they were also marked, as in past years, by dirty politicking among the same. In 1988, when Pat Robertson and Jack Kemp battled for those votes, slanders abounded that Kemp was gay, and that Robertson belonged to a Korean cult. This time, the victim was Steve Forbes, whose yacht was accused of harboring a Mapplethorpe (an accusation designed to allude to Malcolm Forbes Sr.'s late-blooming homosexuality). There is a Mapplethorpe in the Forbes yacht -- a seascape. A group which is itself the regular of malicious falsehoods should take care to honor the common decencies, to say nothing of the Ninth Commandment.<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI>Plans for that nationwide chain of Phil Gramm charm schools have been put on hold.<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI>Because establishment leaders have abandoned them on immigration, the American people have been in effect growing a new head. One sign of this: the high quality of private individuals speaking out on the issue. Thus the University of California at Davis's Professor Norman Matlof has single-handedly discredited the notion that Silicon Valley needs ``foreign geniuses'' [NR, ``Debugging Immigration,'' Oct. 9, 1995]. Now his expose of Chinese and Russian immigrants' massive dumping of elderly parents on the Supplementary Security Income program has been cited by the Heritage Foundation's Robert Rector in the first critical article on immigration to appear on the Wall Street Journal's editorial page for nearly three years. Devastatingly detailed and closely reasoned letters from Linda H. Thom, a Santa Barbara budget analyst, are an occupational hazard for unwary media immigration enthusiasts: Miss Thom has just shown that the U.S. census is systematically understating the impact of immigration by shifting the U.S. citizen children of immigrants into the totals for native-born families. And Barbara Coe, a principal architect of California's successful Proposition 187 denying illegal immigrants social services, is now running for the Republican nomination in the state's 67th assembly district. This is another reason immigration will be an issue in California's March 26 primary. Good luck to her -- and to all of us.<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI>After one year as New York's Governor, George Pataki is rapidly turning the Empire State into the privatization capital of the nation. Pataki's fast start owes much to the appointment of businessman and long-time privatization advocate, Ronald Lauder, as Chairman of New York's Privatization Council. The Administration has accepted Council recommendations to privatize Stewart Airport, the World Trade Center, the freight division of the Long Island Railroad, and a variety of state properties and services. Governor Pataki has also been appointed Chairman of the Privatization Task Force of the Republican Governors' Association. In February, both Pataki and Lauder testified  before Congress's Joint Economic Committee on eliminating federal barriers to privatization (by means other than victory in November).<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI>The era of progress continues. After toppling the previous regime, the victorious military junta in Niger, Africa, sent word of its coup to the country's diplomats abroad by fax.<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI>Maybe Lori Berenson was naive when she and the Tupak Amaru Revolutionary Movement co-signed the lease on a house in Lima, Peru, which police later found packed with weapons. Or maybe Miss Berenson, a 26-year-old Manhattanite sentenced to life imprisonment in Peru for aiding terrorists, really is as fierce a revolutionary as her madwoman-in-the-attic performance at a pre-sentencing press conference would suggest. Probably the truth lies somewhere in between, in which case it wasn't entirely fair of that secret Peruvian military court to make Miss Berenson spend the rest of her days in an Andean dungeon with no heat and no hot water. But ordinary Peruvians, sick of decades of revolutionary terror, don't feel too sorry for Miss Berenson. May her example serve as a warning for other idealistic norteamericanos eager to meddle in other people's politics.<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI>``Grover Cleveland was the only President to serve two non-consecutive terms. Bill Clinton is the only President serving two consecutive Presidencies in one term'' -- Paul Gigot in the Wall Street Journal. Hmmph. By our count, Mr. Clinton is up to six or eight Presidencies, or maybe twenty-three, and that's not counting Mrs. Clinton's Presidencies, which are reinvented every time she changes her hair.<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI>The commander of U.S. forces in South Korea, Gen. Gary Luck, cabled the Pentagon late last year warning that the threat of North Korean Scud missiles was growing and urging that he needed two batteries of the Army's new THAAD (Theater High-Altitude Area Defense) anti-missile launchers as soon as possible. Gen. John Shalikashvili, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, cabled him back a month later to say that delays in the Pentagon's overall theater-missile programs would postpone THAAD deployments until 2002 or 2003 at the earliest. Fortunately, the 1996 defense authorization act -- signed into law February 10 by President Clinton -- will force the Pentagon to cut through the red tape and deploy THAAD and other systems by 1999. Time for Shali to get cracking.<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI>Iran will hold elections for its majlis (parliament), and the Chief Justice, Mohammad Yazdi, gave a sermon on Teheran radio explaining the ground rules: ``It does not matter if [there] is a majority vote or a consensus. As long as the suffrage counters the will of God, it does not count.'' At last, a clue to the late Mayor Richard Daley's whereabouts in the hereafter.<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI>The Army Corps of Engineers, which valiantly defends the nation's wetlands, recently declared the drainage ditches along a highway in central Nebraska to be protected ``waters of the United States.'' The Nebraska Roads Department wanted to fill in the ditches as part of a road-widening project on the twenty-mile stretch of Route 30 between Cozad and Lexington. Before the project could proceed, the Corps demanded offsetting new wetland. To satisfy the Corps, the state Roads Department is buying 19 acres of prime alfalfa farmland at $2,000 an acre and spending more than $2 million to turn it into a bog. The 
Roads Department designed, and the Corps approved, an artificial wetland in the shape of a bison, the state's emblem. Though the Omaha World Herald figured out it's really bull.<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI>President Clinton, meanwhile, has approved a plan to turn hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of productive south-Florida farmland into the Everglades. Like, all we need down there is more alligators, huh? And of course at taxpayer expense. But wait: the land is currently used for growing cane sugar, and the screams you hear are from a handful of domestic growers getting stinking rich thanks to federal sugar-price controls at triple the world price that cheat American consumers out of billions of dollars. The answer is to remove price controls and open U.S. markets to foreign sugar. The farmland will thus lose its artificial premium value, and so be restored to the Everglades at a fraction of the cost. Consumers will save those billions. And the alligators can have any remaining sugar growers.<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI>The victory of ``actress-author'' Joan Collins in a contract dispute with Random House left earnest folk wondering what Miss Collins's famous editor, Joni Evans, could have been thinking. Random House said it shouldn't have to pay for Miss Collins's ``very primitive, very much off base . . . jumbled and disjointed'' novel, as Miss Evans put it sneeringly before a New York jury. Didn't Miss Evans know, when she first offered Miss Collins a multi-million-dollar advance, that actors, like First Ladies and billionaire-businessmen, rarely write their own books, and that when they do, the result tends to be incoherent, dull, or both? Of course Joni Evans knew. What she didn't know was that Joan Collins would fade from TV while the work was in progress, thus cutting into her marketability as a celebrity ``author.'' The jury was right to let Miss Collins keep her advance, bloated as it was by her publisher's greed. As for Joni Evans, she deserves to be confined to her office with nothing to read but Joan Collins novels until she admits that a deal, however dumb, is a deal.<p>

<LI>Standing Pat?
<P>
NEW Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary seems designed to keep the GOP race going to the bitter end, and maybe beyond to a brokered convention. Pat Buchanan won with 27 per cent of the vote and must now be considered a serious candidate. Front-runner Bob Dole ran behind with 26 per cent, so narrow a margin as almost to amount to a tie vote. Senator Dole's failure to score higher is damaging, but hardly enough to justify predicting his defeat. And Lamar Alexander's third-place finish at 23 per cent was indeed better than expected. With Mr. Buchanan supported by the grass-roots, Mr. Dole by the party establishment, and Mr. Alexander by the media, there is a candidate for every taste. So why the gloom?
<P>
A British saying has it that ``the Tory Party never panics -- except in a crisis.'' In the last few weeks, the GOP establishment has outdone the Tories; it has panicked without the excuse of a crisis, and indeed in the face of a historic realignment. Pat Buchanan's strong showings in Louisiana, Iowa, and New Hampshire are treated as harbingers of the end of civilization. Grown politicians threaten not to support him in the (still unlikely) event of his nomination. And there is much dark muttering that the new voters supporting him are -- O Horror! -- not Republicans, but people voting Republican for the first time. (Buchanan Democrats?)
<P>
But things are not as bad as they would seem to those whose interest is limited to differences within the party. Mr. Buchanan's showings are a tribute to his skills as a campaigner, which everyone has long acknowledged. They reflect also the allure of his positions and highlight the narrow ideological turf the GOP has been defending since the Bush years and, yes, even since the Gingrich revolution.
<P>
Mr. Buchanan's issues come in three clusters: moral, cultural, and economic. These attract three broad constituencies. Mr. Buchanan has gathered his support by opposing abortion and gay rights, by affirming family values, and by criticizing a degraded popular culture.  On most of these issues he is at one with other conservative leaders, though he sometimes speaks in a distinctive voice. His opposition to racial and gender quotas and to unrestricted immigration gives him access to the more secular ``radical middle'' owned by Ross Perot. But his appeal to blue-collar voters anxious about their economic future takes him furthest from Republican -- and conservative -- orthodoxy. For here his appeal is frankly protectionist.
<P>
NATIONAL REVIEW has for many years urged the GOP to adopt many of the positions taken by Mr. Buchanan. It is a weakness of the Dole - Gingrich Congress that these issues have been either neglected (official English), or soft-pedaled (immigration, racial quotas). Red-meat issues have yielded to green eyeshades. And the GOP comes off looking like etiolated, bloodless bookkeepers.
<P>
But Mr. Buchanan's economic stance is troublesome. And it is an aspect not only of his economic position but also of his isolationism -- America v. the world. He has rightly identified a strong vein of worry about the economic future among middle-class, especially blue-collar, Americans. These worries are real. But Buchanan's protectionist remedy is flat-out wrong: American workers benefit from selling their goods in global markets, and American consumers benefit from buying goods without the taxation of tariffs. Above all, John O. McGinnis points out in this issue what free trade protects: the American people, against high levels of government regulation and taxation. 
<P>
But political disagreements, even fundamental ones, are the stuff of coalition politics every party must learn to live with. The GOP needs the votes of those attracted by Pat Buchanan in the primaries, and it is reassuring that he has promised to stay within the Republican party, the alternative being a nagging third party whose only accomplishment would be to keep the Democrats in power. There are, after all, many points on which the combatants can agree. Mr. Buchanan endorses a flat tax, his opponents have paid some deference to official English. Before the recent spate of negative ads, these men were all friends and occasional colleagues.
<P>
The anxieties that are appeased by calls for protectionism need to be dealt with. But that policy is uniquely divisive in GOP ranks. The incomes of both low-paid and highly skilled workers have suffered from indiscriminate immigration policies and the prospects of white male workers are plainly hurt by race and gender quotas. Here are issues on which economic conservatives can give Pat Buchanan and his supporters more than they could get from the synthetic and short-term relief of tariff barriers. And if such a compromise unites the GOP, it would also split the Democrats, capturing more blue-collar voters than the Republicans have seen since the Gipper's heyday.
<P>
High stakes. The GOP establishment should play to win big, not hoard its chips for fear of losing. And so should Pat Buchanan.

<FONT SIZE=+3>E</FONT>IGHTEEN months ago, ``The 100 Best Conservative Movies'' was a big hit with NR readers, inspiring an outpouring of their own film favorites. The following new list is drawn mainly from these suggestions with a few additions. Once again, many films come from the 1930s, '40s, and '50s. If you want to understand the meaning of ``Victorian virtues,'' in Gertrude Himmelfarb's phrase (as distinguished from ``modern values''), these movies are the place to start. Their creators often were children of the Victorian age. They grew up with convictions like faith, family, thrift, self-restraint, and patriotism, long before the ``de-moralization'' (Miss Himmelfarb again) of society and mass culture by material affluence, radical ideology, and cynical, corporate commercialism. But lately there are some hopeful signs of  a return to these virtues -- in films like Apollo 13, which celebrates American know-how, or the three new Jane Austen adaptations, which subtly endorse traditional manners and morals. So much for trends in film history. Now to Your 100 Best Conservative Movies.
<P>
Most Popular Conservative Movies Omitted from the Previous List: Patton (1970). This film makes a calculated appeal to anti-war liberals as well as to conservatives. But there's no doubt about George C. Scott's riveting portrayal of our greatest World War II army commander. It's a performance that sweeps away all those liberal theories that the way to fight a war is by controlled escalation or ``sending signals.''
<P>
Ben-Hur (1959). Oscars for Best Picture and Actor (Charlton Heston). The most revived of the 1950s biblical epics, giving a panoramic and realistic view of the cruel pre-Christian world. Long -- but not long enough for many NR readers.
<P>
The Sound of Music (1965). One of the best loved of all movies. President Reagan once apologized for not having read his official papers because the previous night this film had been shown on television. Best-Picture Oscar.
<P>
Best Modern Films about Individual Conscience and Courage: Walking Tall (1973). Based on the true story of Tennessee Sheriff Buford Pusser, powerfully played by Joe Don Baker, who routed local corruption while wielding a baseball bat. See also Lean on Me (1989), the story of conservative New Jersey school principal Joe Clark (played by the admirable Morgan Freeman) for the baseball bat as a symbol of sturdy American righteousness.
Rob Roy (1995). Scotsman fights for his home and property, from the Walter Scott novel. It is, however, marred by needlessly explicit sex and violence. Braveheart (1995), another Scottish patriotic tale, brilliantly directed by Mel Gibson, is also open to criticism for its unrestrained violence. But both are powerful morality tales about chivalry and courage in the face of ruthless adversaries. Incidentally, Tim Roth, the wonderfully wicked English courtier in Rob Roy, may be the long-awaited successor to Basil Rathbone as an all-purpose distinguished villain (see below, passim).
<P>
Notable Films about an Individual's Triumph over Adversity: Rocky (1976). Best Picture Oscar.
Interrupted Melody (1955). The story of opera star Marjorie Lawrence, felled by polio. Tour de force performance by Eleanor Parker (the Baroness in Sound of Music), the unsung greatest actress of the 1950s (e.g., in Caged, Detective Story, and The Man with the Golden Arm.)
<P>
Best Film about a Poor Family's Struggle to Succeed: The Southerner (1945). Sharecropper Zachary Scott's uncle collapses in the field and dies in his arms with the words, ``Grow your own crops.'' This beautifully directed film (French master Jean Renoir) dramatizes the faith, love, and determination that unite Scott's family against terrible adversity; their suffering and hard work lead to fulfillment.
<P>
Best Movies about Russia's War in Afghanistan: The Beast (1988). Superb drama of Red Army versus mujahedin.
<P>
Best Movie about Defeating Terrorism: The Final Option (1982). Stirring film about anti-nuclear Marxist terrorists who seize hostages in U.S. Embassy in London to block deployment of U.S. missiles in Britain. Britain's elite Special Air Services teaches them a thing or two. Also critical of bureaucrat appeasers, this is one of the noteworthy conservative films of the 1980s.
Delta Force (1986). Chuck Norris and his all-purpose motorcycle lead U.S. commandos into downtown Beirut to rescue American hostages. Lively adventure film.
More Great Movie Tributes to the Soldiers of Freedom: Twelve O'Clock High (1949). Outstanding drama about ``tough love'' Air Force commander who saves a wartime USAAF base from demoralization. Plus The Purple Heart (1945); Back to Bataan (1945) and Sands of Iwo Jima (1949), both with John Wayne; Battleground (1949); and Uncommon Valor (1983) among many more.
SPECIAL MENTION: Prisoner of War (1954). Ronald Reagan as intelligence officer who arranges his own capture by North Koreans so he can document their torture of U.S. POWs. Make that man President.
But Not All Soldiers Are in Uniform: In Casablanca (1942), directed by Michael Curtiz, Humphrey Bogart and Claude Rains join the Allies, Ingrid Bergman joins the Resistance, and ``As Time Goes By'' joins the unforgettables.
<P>
Best Movies about Dropping of the Atomic Bomb: The Beginning or the End (1947) and Above and Beyond (1953). Notable for contrast with ABC's vile documentary last July on the Enola Gay mission and other press attacks on this harsh but necessary feat of American arms. The first film, although marred by some propaganda claims, is important because it points out that the success of the $2-billion Manhattan Project was a triumph of free enterprise. Not only scientists, but ``men, women, builders, carpenters, electricians,'' not knowing their project, met the challenge by ``working, working, working.'' The film respects scientists who declined to work on the bomb, but, as the Enrico Fermi character comments, ``Sometimes it takes greater principles to stay than to go.''
Fighters for Good against Evil: The Magnificent Seven (1960), with its famous score by Elmer Bernstein.
<P>
Best Films Depicting Martial Valor: Zulu (1964) and Zulu Dawn (1979). If the battle of Rorke's Drift -- in which ninety Welsh soldiers beat off an attack by four thousand Zulu warriors -- had not happened, we would have dismissed it as a cartoon adventure. But a heroic episode gets a superb dramatization in Zulu (also an early Michael Caine movie).
Best Movies about the Evil of Our Enemies: The Hunt for Red October (1990). Russia plans first strike against U.S. Plus The Fourth Protocol (1987), about a KGB nuclear terrorist (although weakened by liberal ending).
The Charge of the Light Brigade (1936), directed by Michael Curtiz. This sweeping Errol Flynn epic has nothing to do with the facts of that disaster, but it has a scene that should be required viewing for all hostage negotiators. British commander of garrison besieged along the Northwest Frontier accepts treacherous enemy Surat Khan's pledge of safe passage, only to see all men, women, and children slaughtered.
<P>
Best Swashbucklers: Mention of the intrepid Mr. Flynn inevitably brings us to this thrilling genre. What makes swashbucklers conservative? They feature bold heroes who have no difficulty at all distinguishing right from wrong: no moral relativism for these fellows. Three of the best are:
Captain Blood (1935). Still the best pirate saga. Classic duel on the beach between Flynn and his rival, the inimitable Basil Rathbone, for the hand of Olivia de Havilland, to the stirring music of Erich Wolfgang Korngold. Directed by (who else?) Michael Curtiz.
Gunga Din (1939). Cary Grant and comrades in British India. (Hollywood did more for the British Empire than Cecil Rhodes.) Sam Jaffe is the courageous sepoy who perishes as he saves the battalion: ``You're a better man than I am, Gunga Din.'' A noteworthy point about imperial epics like Gunga Din and Drums (1938) is that anti-colonial rebels are not dismissed as savages, but allowed to state their case.
Thunder Road (1958). A swashbuckler is a flamboyant adventurer. That certainly describes Robert Mitchum in this cult classic about a slick-haired, independent hero running moonshine past ``Revenooers'' through the Smokey Mountains.
Happily, with the Reagan 1980s we saw a return to tradition with Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989), all directed by Steven Spielberg. Good, although slightly self-conscious, fun.
<P>
John Wayne's Oscar: True Grit (1969). Our aging, fat-bellied hero still has what it takes to dispatch Robert Duvall and a host of other villains as he fights for justice for a teenage girl (herself full of the right stuff).
Best John Wayne Character of Our Time: Clint Eastwood of course in, among other films, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (1966), High Plains Drifter (1973), Pale Rider (1985), and the Dirty Harry series.
<P>
Best Adventure Film about Personal Redemption: The Four Feathers (1939). Branded a coward, young aristocrat redeems himself in the 1898 Sudan campaign. Perhaps  the best movie celebration of imperial heroics, it contains a superb conservative speech by the heroine explaining why duty must come before happiness.
<P>
Glorifying the American Family -- and Families Divided: Ah, Wilderness (1935). Lovely comedy of teenage growing pains in turn-of-the-century New England (from the play by, curiously, Eugene O'Neill). Affectionately directed by Clarence Brown. Funniest scene: the high-school graduation.
The Fighting Sullivans (1944). Story of five brothers who all went down for their country with the U.S.S. Juneau in the Solomon Islands in November 1942. Most of the film depicts their childhood and is a case study in classic family virtues.
Life with Father (1947). Mary Gaydos of New York loves William Powell (playing Clarence Day), writing: ``Perhaps you have something against red-headed, heterosexual, capitalist, Eurocentrist men. Me, I love them.'' Directed (again) by the great Michael Curtiz.
Love Finds Andy Hardy (1938). One of the vastly popular series about the growing pains of young Mickey Rooney, who learns some truths at the knee of father Lewis Stone.
Of Human Hearts (1938). Young James Stewart becomes an army surgeon in the Civil War thanks to the sacrifices of his mother; but he ignores her, and for his ingratitude receives a lecture on a son's duties from no less than President Lincoln himself. Yes, it sounds corny, but this is a moving film, directed by Clarence Brown. John Carradine's Lincoln is by far the most credible performance in this impossible part.
Home from the Hill (1959). A divided Texas family, and the hurt endured by an illegitimate son whose father won't accept him. This film has the most restrained murder scene in movie history -- we see no killer, no weapon, and no blood, but the artistry of director Vincente Minnelli (he made more than just the best musicals like Gigi) conveys all the horror and pathos of the crime. Is such artistry of restraint beyond the abilities of today's filmmakers? Robert Mitchum's best movie.
<P>
Best Scene Dramatizing the Sanctity of Innocent Life: Rob Roy (see above). Our hero's wife is raped by his enemy, but Rob Roy embraces the child she conceives as an innocent life that must be brought into the world.
<P>
Best Movies about Children Learning Virtue: Captains Courageous (1937). Rich brat falls off transatlantic liner and is rescued by fishing trawler. Under the tutelage of a simple, devout Portuguese fisherman, he learns to be a man. Spencer Tracy as Manuel amply earned his first Oscar for the role that made him a major star. Based on the novel by Rudyard Kipling, and directed by Victor Fleming, this is one of the outstanding films of Hollywood's Golden Age.
Boys Town (1938). Tracy retained the Oscar as Father Flanagan, who founded an orphanage for ``wayward'' boys: volunteerism over bureaucracy. The film reflects traditional liberal reformism in its stress on improving a child's environment -- although conservative suggestions nowadays on removing neglected children to better surroundings receive liberals' scorn. Perhaps liberals worry this new environment would include religious teaching and discipline, as in the film, rather than ``self-esteem.''
<P>
More Classics about Religious Faith: Faith is not, of course, a matter of being conservative or liberal, but the treatment of religious themes in earlier movies reflected a society that was less secular -- and thus healthier -- than our own.
The Fugitive (1947). ``Whisky priest'' in Mexico on the run from anti-clerical government. As in Graham Greene's novel, the flawed vessel of Christianity offers more real hope for the people than the this-worldly salvation of the socialist state. Reportedly the personal favorite of director John Ford.
A Man Called Peter (1955). Biography of the Scotsman who became a minister and chaplain to the U.S. Senate. 
The Keys of the Kingdom (1944). A missionary in China.
<P>
Best Conservative Romantic Movie: Camille (1937). This classic story of a beautiful, consumptive Parisian courtesan, who forsakes her life of riches and pleasure for the love of an earnest young diplomat, is conservative in 1996 because it is a story about responsibility and sacrifice. It also features Greta Garbo in the screen's most moving performance.
<P>
The film, directed with rich detail and nuanced understatement by George Cukor, contrasts Garbo's hedonistic life with an almost sacred depiction of marriage, family, and religious ritual. When Garbo cynically dismisses her friend Nichette's plan to marry a penniless young lawyer (they once existed), Nichette entreats her: ``It's ideal to love and to marry the one you love.'' Their later wedding scene in the country (the priest reciting the Latin service) briefly but movingly conveys the holiness of the marriage sacrament. In another brief but telling scene, Cukor depicts the devout familial bonds of Robert Taylor's (Garbo's diplomat suitor) family, and particularly the respect of son for father (Lionel Barrymore).
<P>
The peak of Garbo's performance is the renunciation scene, when Barrymore pleads with her to end her country idyll with his son, who will be ruined if it goes on. Barrymore had come in anger and reproach. Love cannot last, he says, ``unsanctified by marriage, unblessed by children or social ties.'' But -- such is the spirituality and force of Garbo's performance -- he departs with humility, gratitude, and admiration when she accedes to his pleas.
<P>
Also noteworthy from today's perspective is the eroticism conveyed by the film's understatement. In a famous scene at one of Garbo's Paris parties, Taylor has followed her into her boudoir, where he urges that she send her friends away. She agrees, but he must leave first to keep the others off guard. As he kneels before her, she leans over and kisses him all over his face -- restrained by the Production Code, but white hot with passion. Such restraint also raises the dueling scene between Taylor and Garbo's aristocrat paramour (Henry Daniell) to classic status: the camera is on Garbo as she hurries out of her carriage, running to stop it. No gore, only the sound of the pistols firing, but deeply dramatic.
<P>
Camille's lavish production, the hallmark of MGM (e.g., The Wizard of Oz), reflects the sensibility of a more refined, civilized time. It is evident how much the studio strove for perfection: sets, costumes, Garbo's hair styles, editing, and music (one of the few successful examples of classical music as a score, arranged with keen dramatic sense by Herbert Stothart) underline the writing and acting to make a profound emotional experience.
<P>
HONORABLE MENTION: Sense and Sensibility (1995) for its depiction, as in Camille, of romantic love, and for its realization of the ideals of visual beauty and noble character. This is the best translation to film among the recent crop of Jane Austen adaptations; but both Persuasion and the made-for-TV Pride and Prejudice are fine pictures -- well acted, beautifully photographed, and scrupulously attentive to period detail and atmosphere. More to the point here, they embody a classical morality of self-restraint, civility, and good manners -- but also the injunction not to be deceived by outward appearances.
<P>
Best Soap-Opera Movie about Accepting Responsibility: My Reputation (1946). Barbara Stanwyck could have received an Oscar for this performance as a young widow with two boys. After extended mourning, she is about to accompany an officer friend to New York, only to recognize that her duty lies with her children. Her mother advises, ``Young people hate convention. But as they grow older they learn conventions meet a need.'' When she bids her friend goodbye at the train station, he says, ``You have to take responsibility. You wouldn't be you if you didn't.''
<P>
Ronald Reagan's Most Charming Movie: The Voice of the Turtle a/k/a One for the Book (1947). Sgt. Reagan on wartime leave in New York is stood up by superficial Eve Arden and falls for winsome young Eleanor Parker, a fellow-unsophisticate. In a movie glowing with gossamer charm, they dance to ``Danny Boy,'' have milk and cookies -- and he sleeps on the couch. One of the many 1940s films that paint New York as a wonderfully civilized city, and NR's favorite Reagan movie.
<P>
Best Scene Illustrating pre - Great Society View of Welfare: In Love on the Run (1936), Joan Crawford flees her London socialite wedding and is spirited off to France by Clark Gable. When she learns Gable is a reporter who has been secretly filing stories with his New York paper, she sends him packing, and he's fired. The following dialogue ensues between Miss Crawford and Gable's rival (Franchot Tone):
Tone: ``He's blacklisted. Through.''<BR>
Crawford: ``Can he do anything else?''<BR>
Tone: ``Nothing that won't land him in jail.''<BR>
Crawford: ``I suppose he'll get on relief.''<BR>
Tone: ``He might for a few days, but that's all. They're fussy about who gets on relief.''<BR>
<P>
Best Movie Dramatizing pre - Great Society View of Penology: The Big House (1930). Still among the best prison dramas. The inmates here have no radio and no weights. They wear grim flannel uniforms, are marched into the mess hall, and, when the guard's whistle blows, eat their gruel in silence. If they get out of line (which doesn't take much), they are deposited in the ``dungeon,'' where they stew alone for thirty days on bread and water. And when they riot and take guards hostage, Warden Lewis Stone answers their demand for freedom: ``I'll see 'em in Hell first. Let 'em have it.'' Whereupon his machine guns open up and the tanks crash through the inmates' barricade. Or was the lower crime-rate in those Depression days just a coincidence?
<P>
Best Movies about Capital Punishment: Angels with Dirty Faces (1938). Murderer James Cagney agrees to the request of Father Pat O'Brien to feign fear as he heads to the electric chair in order to give a moral lesson in the wages of sin to the Bowery Boys. Another Michael Curtiz winner, and a welcome contrast to amoral blood baths like Bonnie and Clyde and The Godfather.
Just Cause (1995). Liberal law professor saves victim of police brutality from Death Row -- only to find he really is a vicious murderer. In today's Hollywood, this is a surprise.
Best Movie about Government Economic Controls: A Private Function (1985). Confronted with British Labor government's rationing, three local worthies fatten up an illegal pig. The vet's socially ambitious wife discovers the plot, and a British class-war comedy breaks out. All Creatures Great and Small laced with arsenic.
<P>
The Editor's Favorite Satire on Modern Manners: Serial (1979). Hilarious send-up of ``liberated'' Northern California customs from granola to marriage (``I declare thee to be pair-bonded for so long as you find it mutually enriching''), drawn from Cyra MacFadden's martini-dry satire. Brilliant off-beat casting includes Christopher ``Dracula'' Lee as leader of gay San Francisco bikers.
Four More Conservative Comedies: Being There (1979). The always brilliant Peter Sellers as an obscure, hermit-like gardener who finds himself the darling of Washington's power elite and a media sage. Is ``being there,'' rather than knowing anything, a secret to Washington success? Sellers does dispense two bits of wisdom: Let the economy grow on its own like a garden (though it's not clear the film takes a positive view of this advice) and -- horrors -- he doesn't read the New York Times or Washington Post!
Sullivan's Travels (1942). Joel McCrea as Hollywood comedy director (Ants in the Pants of 1933) who wants to make socially significant films (Brother, Where Art Thou?) but accidentally lands in a Southern prison where he learns that the oppressed masses would rather laugh than be uplifted. This comedy has an unexpectedly moving scene that has probably done more to undermine racism than anything out of Washington -- a black preacher urges his dirt-poor congregation not to shun the prisoners when they arrive shackled for Sunday service; they are God's children too. Written and directed by Preston Sturges. Mr. McCrea, incidentally, was the staunchest of Hollywood conservatives.
Brother Orchid (1940). Edward G. Robinson as hood who takes refuge as a monk in a monastery. At first he tries to work the monastic system to his own advantage, but he soon learns the real truths of life from the other monks.
Harry's War (1981). Postman battles IRS.
<P>
Best Tax-Revolt Movie: The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938). Rush Limbaugh once noted that Robin Hood is actually the story of taking from the government and giving to the poor and middle class. Here Errol Flynn is the definitive Robin in another great triumph of Hollywood's Golden Age, directed by (you guessed it!) Michael Curtiz, with William Keighley. We first encounter Flynn galloping his horse as the camera cuts to a close-up of his confident, smiling face. This heroic romanticism characterizes the entire film, from the early Technicolor verdant greens and shimmering light that evoke Sherwood Forest as Arcadia, to the balcony scene between Flynn and Olivia de Havilland (Maid Marian), accompanied by a gorgeous love theme from Erich Wolfgang Korngold's Richard Strauss - Puccini-like score. Supply-siders will love the ambush of the villains in Sherwood and even Keynesians will relish the duel (photographed in silhouette against monumental castle walls) between Flynn and Basil Rathbone. Run through, Rathbone plunges into the moat, and Flynn leaps down a stairway to the dungeon into Miss de Havilland's loving arms, all to triumphant Korngold fanfares.
<P>
Finest Unsung Anti-Communist Movie: Hollywood's political transformation in the 1960s sent a large batch of anti-Communist movies down the memory hole. The Red Danube (1949) is the best of them -- a striking drama about forced repatriation of Russians in postwar Vienna. The conflict is one of Christianity against Communism. A decent, atheist British officer (Walter Pidgeon) thinks it his duty to return to the Russian sector a young ballerina (the lovely Janet Leigh) who has been given sanctuary in a convent. After a series of debates with the Mother Superior (Ethel Barrymore) and the suicide of the ballerina, he eventually understands how faith helps one recognize evil (``This is what men do to other men when they don't believe in God''). Excellent script and cast, including the young Angela Lansbury as Pidgeon's service driver. Occasionally seen late at night on TNT -- but, then, so is the absurdly pro-Stalinist Mission to Moscow.
<P>
More Anti-Communist Movies: The Conspirator (1949) features the gorgeous 17-year-old Elizabeth Taylor as wife of British officer and Red spy. Her shock and disgust on learning of his treason, as if he had the plague, is a valuable reminder of the early resolute Cold War spirit.
<P>
Of course, the greatest anti-Communist movie is, improbably, a comedy: Ninotchka (1939), directed by Ernst Lubitsch, written by Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder, starring Garbo and Melvyn Douglas. This appeared in the first list of best conservative films, but it must be mentioned again because, underneath the jokes, it is a powerful defense of humane values against totalitarian ``virtue.''
Example: ``How are things in Moscow?''
``Very good. The last mass trials were a great success. There are going to be fewer but better Russians.''
<P>
Also be sure to see Pickup on South Street (1953), directed by Samuel Fuller; The Woman on Pier 13 a/k/a I Married a Communist (1949); The Prisoner (1955); The Seduction of Mimi (Italy, 1974); Night People (1954); High Treason (1952); Guilty of Treason (1950), about the Cardinal Mindszenty case; and the recent Burned by the Sun (1995).
<P>
Another Classic about the Inhumanity of Mass Revolution: The Scarlet Pimpernel (1935). Cross out ``Bolsheviks,'' insert ``Jacobins'' -- and send in languid aristocrat Leslie Howard to rescue the victims and wife Merle Oberon from Robespierre's left-hand man, played by Raymond Massey (second only to Basil Rathbone in portraying distinguished villains). Interestingly, Howard actually was a British agent in World War II.
<P>
Two More Great Movies about the Value of Tradition: Goodbye, Mr. Chips (1939). Robert Donat, who won the Oscar for Best Actor, is superb as the shy teacher whose long service wins the affection of generations of schoolboys. Telling moment: Mr. Chips, reading out list of teachers and old boys killed in World War I, includes the former teacher of German who died fighting on the other side.
Tunes of Glory (1960). A Scottish regiment falls into turmoil when army bureaucrat tries to override its traditions.
<P>
Best Movie Depicting America as One Culture: It's a Big Country (1952). Eight short stories about the immigrant experience, with an all-star cast (Gene Kelly, Gary Cooper, Fredric March, Nancy Davis). Best line: ``Religion is part of the heart of American culture.'' Note the producer, liberal Dore Schary. Liberal then, conservative today: because the Clintons' secular and multicultural politics are radical; they have abandoned traditional liberalism. Where today's liberals prattle about ``diversity,'' Schary's movie ends: ``America, one nation, indivisible.''
<P>
Best Movie Critique of Multiculturalism: Around the World in Eighty Days (Best Picture of 1956). Intrepid Phileas Fogg (David Niven), exemplar of British imperial phlegm, rescues Indian princess from suttee funeral pyre (young Shirley MacLaine, of all people!). Many critics today undoubtedly would object. After all, if that's the Indian custom, what right has Fogg to impose Western values?
<P>
Best Anti-Anti-American Movie: Barcelona (1994) describes the last gasp of European anti-
Americanism -- the Soviet-inspired campaign to halt U.S. missile deployment in the early Eighties -- through the eyes of two young Americans trying to pick up Spanish girls. Good fun.
<P>
Best Conservative Science-Fiction Movies: Frankenstein (1931) and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1932) explore the consequences of hubris -- Dr. F.'s ``insane ambition'' and ``mad dream.'' Sounds like the Great Society -- except that Mr. Hyde and the Monster don't live on indefinitely.
The Thing (1951). The scientist as Rationalist Fool. Researchers in the Arctic defrost a visitor from outer space who is not friendly. Here is an early prototype of the scientists behind SANE and the nuclear freeze, and who oppose any common-sense policy to defend ourselves. Best scene: the scientist attempts to negotiate.
<P>
Best Conservative Musicals: MGM's Singin' in the Rain (1952), An American in Paris (1951), and The Bandwagon (1953). They are conservative because Gene Kelly, Fred Astaire, and director Vincente Minnelli celebrate common sense and professionalism over pretension and phoniness. They have no designs on us, they simply want to divert and amuse.
<P>
Best Conservative Special-Effects Movie: San Francisco (1936), for the famous earthquake. Clark Gable as blasphemous gambler finds faith through priest friend Spencer Tracy and beautiful, devout Jeanette MacDonald.
<P>
Best Scene Illustrating Press Irresponsibility: King Kong (1933). As the giant ape is being exhibited in a New York theater, the press is invited onto the stage to photograph Ann Darrow (Fay Wray) standing before him. The flash bulbs enrage the beast and his captor demands they stop: ``He thinks you're attacking the girl.'' The photographers click away, one saying: ``Let him roar. It's a swell picture.'' The rest of the story is, as they say, history.
<P>
Best Movie Illustrating Politicians' Blather: In Hitchcock's The 39 Steps (1935), our hero on the run finds himself in a political meeting, where he is mistaken for the official introducing the candidate. He proceeds to deliver a hilarious parody of windy oratory -- and gets a standing ovation.
HONORABLE MENTION: A Face in the Crowd (1957). This will stand as the best movie depiction of an Arkansas demagogue until Barbra Streisand produces a movie biography of the 42nd President. A striking film about TV image manipulation, ahead of its time. Directed by Elia Kazan.
<P>
Best Conservative Silent Movies: Orphans of the Storm (1921), America (1926), both by the father of all directors, D. W. Griffith; plus Ben Hur (1925); The Iron Horse (1924), directed by John Ford; and Noah's Ark (1929), an early Michael Curtiz gem in which the flood was so realistic that some extras drowned.
Best Conservative Shorts: The Sons of Liberty, with Claude Rains as Hayim Solomon, who comes to the financial rescue of Washington's Army, and dies reciting the Declaration of Independence. (One more by Michael Curtiz.)
The Monroe Doctrine. The melodramatic sweep and production panache of Casablanca applied to U.S. history.
An Airman's Letter to His Mother. U.K. film by Michael Powell, based on fact, in which RAF officer penned an eloquent statement of war aims before he was shot down.
And Our Gang in Three Smart Guys, wherein the boys play hooky and go fishing, only to receive a lesson in how those who study catch the biggest fish of all.

<P>
Dear Rusty,
<P>

A few months ago, Bill and I were having lunch together, and I said to him, ``Bill, you should get out and meet the people, get the campaign muscles warmed up.'' He nodded, picked up the phone, dialed a few numbers, and said into the phone, ``Dick, it's Bill. What are my numbers today?''
A few minutes later, the fax machine delivered the numbers: he beats Dole, Lamar!, and Buchanan. He's got a 49 per cent approval rating in Iowa and New Hampshire -- which, with the margin of error, is almost a 49.5 per cent!
``Al,'' Bill said as he surveyed his fax, ``it looks like I'm going to New Hampshire and Iowa.''
I headed off to Florida to talk about preserving the Everglades, a real barnburner. After the rally, I headed to a local coffee shop to do what we in the campaign biz call ``a flying drop-by.''
I moved on down the row of booths until another elderly woman introduced me to her husband.
``What brings you to the Miami - Dade area?'' she asked.
``What?'' asked her husband.
``I ASKED HIM WHAT BRINGS HIM TO THE AREA,'' she replied loudly. Several Secret Service agents turned down their earpieces.
``I'm here to talk about preserving the indigenous creatures of South Florida. You know, we too easily assume that because a mammal has scaly skin or is unattractive to look at, that we can just let it die. Well I'm here to fight for their preservation.''
``HE'S HERE TO PRESERVE SOCIAL SECURITY,'' she shouted.
``Well, actually -- ''
``You mean you're not?'' she asked.
``That's exactly why I'm here,'' I said.
You know, Rusty, back in the '88 Democratic primary, I would have told that woman the truth: that I wasn't in South Florida to talk about Social Security, and that if I was elected, I would means-test benefits and gradually phase out the system, and replace it with an IRA-type instrument. 
Boy, have I learned a lot since then!
A quick change of clothes and I was in snowy New Hampshire.
Since I had so much luck with the senior citizens in Florida, I scoped out a lonely looking old man sitting by himself at the counter of the local Derry, New Hampshire coffee shop.
``Sir,'' I said, ``I'm Al Gore, and Bill Clinton and I would like your vote in November.''
``Forget it, Al,'' said the man. ``I'm going all the way.'' And then he chuckled to himself.
``Dick Lugar?'' I asked.
``So what if I am?'' said the old man, who, it turned out, was indeed Dick Lugar. ``So what if I come in fifth or sixth? I've just got to stay viable until Super Tuesday, ride out the storm, walk into the convention hall with my head held high, and then, you know what? People will say -- hey, Dole can't beat Clinton, Lamar can't beat Dole, but who's the man with the eye of the tiger? Who's the White Knight come to slay the Dragon?''
``Colin Powell?'' I asked.
``Exactly. And when he isn't available it'll all fall in Dickie Lugar's lap, just you wait.'' He held his coffee mug up to the waitress. ``You want to hotten this up for me, honey?''
As she poured him more coffee, I slipped out.
I was about to enter another local coffee shop, when we had to wait for the CNN camera crew to make it from Manchester, where Pat Buchanan had announced that Burger King was owned by Grand Metropolitan, an English-owned company, and that when he was elected, he'd string concertina wire along the drive-through lane until each Whopper was ``crafted with pride by legal Americans in the USA.''
As I waited outside the coffee shop for the crew to arrive, it began to snow.
``Can't I wait inside the coffee shop?'' I asked.
``Then we'll miss getting the delighted looks on the faces of the citizens of Nashua as they realize that the Vice President is joining them for lunch.''
``But they can see me standing here through the window. Look, some of them are waving.''
``Don't worry, Mr. Vice President. These are New Hampshire folks. They'll turn it on for the cameras. They're just saving their energy for show time.''
But, sad to say, Rusty, I never did get to go inside. Boy, did I freeze my toes out there in the snow. But, apparently, back at the Burger King in Manchester, Pat Buchanan committed a verbal gaffe when he declared that he was the only candidate running who would beat President Hindenburg in November -- so the CNN crew never left.
I'm getting the feeling back in my toes! I'm ready for Super Tuesday!

NEW YORK, FEBRUARY 16
<p>
Mr. Yeltsin has announced that he will run for re-election as President of Russia. It is his duty to ``consolidate all healthy forces and prevent shocks that could lead to a civil war.'' That is quite a threat to toss about, something no candidate in New Hampshire has got around to. In the past few months Mr. Yeltsin has got rid of those of his lieutenants identified with the reform movement. This greatly surprised those members of our State Department who rued the long interval back in 1991 during which Gorbachev was falling apart and U.S. policy refused to recognize the importance of Yeltsin. We did so only after that dramatic day in Red Square when Yeltsin defied the revolutionists and soon after was elected president.
<P>
It was demoralizing to read the assessment of Yeltsin by Vyacheslav Kostikov, Yeltsin's former press secretary. ``Power is his ideology,'' he said, ``his concubine if you want, his lover -- and his passion. Everything that is beyond the fight for power concerns him much less.'' When that remark about Yeltsin was aired, Kostikov was instantly fired (he had been ambassador to the Vatican). Fifty years earlier he'd have been instantly executed. Even ten years ago he would have suffered something more resonant than dismissal from a diplomatic post.
<p>
There are many contenders for the presidency of Russia, but the thinking in some quarters is that there will be a run-off between the two lead candidates, and that they will be Yeltsin and Gennadi Zyuganov. Now Mr. Zyuganov, formerly a provincial teacher, is running on the Communist Party ticket and is thought the probable victor.
<p>
It staggers the mind. Suppose that in Germany a politician were to run on the National Socialist Party ticket. He might say, ``Let's see if this time around we can do it without killing the Jews, or invading France.'' Zyuganov being a very acute politician, it can't be said of him that he got tripped up into running as a Communist. As with Yeltsin, one can't know what this politician's internal designs or attachments or loyalties are. But Zyuganov proclaims his attachment to Communism, intending to persuade the Russians that much of the pain they now experience -- en route to a free society and a free market -- they didn't experience back then under Stalin and Brezhnev, when no one was ever fired from his job, prices were stable, and crime was at low tide. In December's parliamentary race Zyuganov faced a liberal challenger. At one of their encounters, posters were flaunted: ``50,000,000 VICTIMS OF CIVIL WAR, COLLECTIVIZATION AND REPRESSION WOULD NOT VOTE FOR ZYUGANOV.'' He won handily.
<p>
The great revisionism is underway. It begins by closing the memory. Four years ago, 84 per cent of high-school students tested knew what the Gulag was. Today, only 34 per cent can tell you that the Gulag was that great charnel, the archipelago in which twenty million Russians were killed, either by execution squads, or starvation, or exposure. Such historical tablelands, when brought to the attention of the Communist candidate for President, are shrugged off as incidents of yesteryear. ``We can't answer for the mistakes of the past.''
<p>
What is lost sight of is the primary finding of history in the matter of the Communist approach to government. It is that the cruelty, the repression, the economic sclerosis are an organic part of the whole. When Gorbachev authorized glasnost his critics proved absolutely correct, that glasnost would need to be repealed, or else that it would bring on the dissolution of the Communist enterprise, because free speech and Communism are irreconcilable. Yeltsin is already moving toward economic interventionism, and in his pursuit of power will almost certainly go further. The Communists in China are experimenting with economic freedom carefully sequestered, but their fear of its leverage on civil rights brings them to furious exhibitions of power and threat; because experience teaches that economic freedom requires a measure of personal freedom. 
<p>
So, after all of this, the next President of Russia might be a Communist. What will be his attitude toward the liberated republics? We know what the position is of Zhirinovsky, the hero of the super nationalists: bring them all back. If that were accomplished, we would be facing a Communist leader of a new Soviet Union and wondering, quite reasonably, whether it would be thought new for so very long.
<P>

26-FEBRUARY-1996
<P>

<LI>Outgoing, and if that isn't proof of God, what is? Rep. Pat Schroeder (D., Colo.)
instructed Sen. Al D'Amato (R., N.Y.) to stop the ``witch hunt'' against Hillary Clinton.
Ahhh . . . le mot juste. <p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI>The Republican loss of Bob Packwood's Oregon Senate seat shouldn't come as a shock, even
though conservative businessman Gordon Smith had a good chance to pull off a long-shot
victory there. Instead, Rep. Ron Wyden, the Portland liberal who in his 15 years in Congress
has famously managed to avoid learning Bosnia's location or the name of the Canadian prime
minister, squeaked through by a paper-thin 1 per cent margin. If Wyden's win is hardly a
harbinger of a liberal revival, it does point to some Republican weaknesses, especially on
the environment. Wyden made crucial inroads among suburban women with the issue, which
Republicans have consistently mishandled over the last year (they have yet to find a
convincing way to defend free-market environmental reforms). Meanwhile, liberal coalition
groups demonstrated that they still have some weight to throw around, dumping hundreds of
thousands of dollars into ads that made a mockery of Wyden's ``100 per cent positive''
campaign. The Teamsters ran a shameful radio spot accusing Smith of, in effect, being
responsible for the death of a 14-year-old at one of his companies. Smith, a top-notch
candidate, almost overcame it all, even prevailing among older voters, according to one exit
poll, despite the usual Democratic Mediscare campaign. The GOP should take heart: if a
conservative message almost takes in ecotopian Oregon, it can sell anywhere.

<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI> Mrs. Clinton must now be willing to answer the Senate Whitewater Committee's questions
in writing. She called Barbara Feinman to the White House.

<p>

<HR WIDTH=50%>

<p>

<LI> Rep. Charles Canady (R., Fla.) plans to revive his bill banning federal race and gender
preferences, again presenting the House leadership with the decision whether or not to push
it. Last year, the leadership blinked, opting for the development of an ``empowerment
package'' that would, in theory, provide cover for a subsequent assault on racial
preferences. That package is now almost complete, but waiting for it to wend its way through
Congress would be a mistake. No package of enterprise zones and school vouchers is ever
going to win over blocs of minority voters or make it easy to repeal preferences. But the
same voices that urged the empowerment tack last year -- including Southern conservatives
worried about energizing their districts' black voters -- will be raised against Canady
again. Their fears are unjustified: Are any of the 226 Republicans who voted to end the
Viacom set-aside last year suffering as a result? In any case, with a revived California
Civil Rights Initiative now likely to make the November ballot (thanks to the support of
Gov. Pete Wilson), there will be no dodging affirmative action in the fall. Congressional
Republicans might as well seize the moral high ground of color-blindness, present President
Clinton with a bill that makes for a tough veto -- and stop looking guilt-ridden about it.

<LI> The ruckus over the proposed Parental Rights Amendment, which asserts that ``The right
of parents to direct the upbringing and education of their children shall not be
infringed,'' points up the degree to which the traditional prerogatives of parents have
already been eroded by the state. Through the schools, it has arrogated to itself the right
to counsel children on everything from careers to abortion options. Introduced now in twenty
state legislatures with eight more in the offing, the amendment has so far garnered wide
support, including that of the very visible Virginia Gov. George Allen; some, believing the
idea less viable as an amendment, have embodied its essence in more salable bills before
legislatures. Critics say they oppose the watering-down of local school boards' legitimate
authority to help abused or neglected children. What they really dread is the loss of the
educational establishment's promotion of a purely secular agenda. One proponent of the
amendment accurately described the opposition as showing ``the level of distrust of parents
by the elitist so-called experts who want to raise our children. Whose kids are they,
anyway?''

<LI> House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt has spent his long congressional career
fighting Republican tax-cut proposals. In the 1980s he opposed President Reagan's cuts in
the income-tax rate. In the early 1990s he successfully blocked President Bush's proposal to
cut capital-gains taxes. And, today, he stands in the way of Republican efforts to grant
parents a $500-per-child tax credit. Gephardt, a self-proclaimed advocate of ``working
Americans,'' says Republican tax-relief initiatives subsidize fat cats by raiding programs
for the elderly, the poor, and the infirm. Thanks to an ethics complaint filed against
Gephardt by Rep. Jennifer Dunn (R., Wash.) we now know that in 1991, while he was blocking
tax cuts for the rest of us, he was involved in a property swap to acquire a substantial
oceanfront lot. The deal enabled Gephardt to avoid paying about $79,500 in capital-gains
taxes. Apparent inconsistencies among Gephardt's real-estate and tax records raise serious
questions of possible tax and bank fraud. Worst of all, think of the schoolchildren who went
without hot lunches.

<LI> The key to Republican success is to make the next election a referendum on the
incumbent President -- to run, in other words, a ``negative'' campaign. An implication of
this strategy is that Republicans in Congress must abandon the attempt to build a
``positive'' record for themselves. An object lesson in what not to do is provided by the
GOP's decision, as we go to press, to send President Clinton a watered-down package of
welfare and Medicaid reforms cobbled together by the nation's governors. The substance of
this deal is bad enough. For the sake of immediate budget savings for the states,
Republicans are now endorsing proposals that would have no perceptible effect on American
life -- other than to persuade the public five years from now that conservative reforms have
been tried and have failed. The politics is worse. Clinton has already vetoed welfare and
Medicaid reform: now he will have another opportunity to deprive Republicans of a key issue
and build up a fraudulent ``New Democrat'' personality. By September, he will be sounding
like Charles Murray on the stump.

trial lawyers, arguably the least-liked group in the nation; and d) reinforced the
perception of a man bereft of core beliefs, since only a few days before his veto he was
telling supporters he would sign the bill. Well, at least he's efficient.

<LI> It just isn't safe to make a joke about global warming. Someone will take it seriously.
So it happened when we wrote that the January 7 - 8 blizzard in the Northeast obviously
``proves'' global warming has arrived . . . Whereupon Jessica Matthews, a leading
environmentalist commentator, immediately wrote a column in the  Washington Post arguing
precisely this proposition with great seriousness. Global warming as a long-term trend, said
she, is increasing the severity of the weather, whether hot or cold, flood or drought. The
problem is that the climate models all predict higher temperatures at the poles (hence the
melting of the icecaps) and minimal change at the equator. Since most extreme weather events
are driven by temperature differences between the poles and the equator, global warming
should reduce the severity of storms, not increase them. At other times it has been claimed
that the warming would be apparent if only all that awful atmospheric pollution weren't
there. A few years ago, we were being told that the explosion of Mount Pinatubo was masking
global-warming effects. And so it goes. If one argument disappears, another is grasped, then
another. The theory is logically unfalsifiable, hence unscientific. One thing, however, is
clear: since global temperatures began to be measured accurately from a satellite in 1979,
there has been no warming trend, rather a slight cooling. The rest is, well, hot air.

protesting France's just-completed series of underground nuclear tests in the Pacific. Poor

<LI> In Rochester, New York, the parents of a comatose young woman have been confronted with
certain ``ethical'' considerations about saving the life of a baby growing inside their
daughter's body. The daughter has been in a coma for ten years, and this past summer she
seems to have been raped by someone at her nursing home. Before the car crash that sent her
into a coma, she was adamantly pro-life, and so her parents think she would object to an
abortion. An ``ethicist'' quoted in the New York Times will have none of it. Ellen Moskowitz
asks if ``using [the comatose woman] as a vessel . . . offends the natural order.'' So, goes
the implied answer, off with the baby's head! For the pregnant woman's Catholic parents, the
``natural order'' has a name, God, and in His eyes using their daughter ``as a vessel'' is
better than killing their grandchild. It looks as if ``ethics,'' as our pluralists define
it, is a one-way street, which always leads away from God, even if believers are involved.
Which isn't very pluralistic, is it?

<H1>GEORGE WASHINGTON</H1> 

<H2>Founding Father</H2>
<p>
<H3>by RICHARD BROOKHISER</H3>  
<p> 
<I>His own father died when he was 11, and he had no children
himself.<BR> But Washington bound his fate to the destiny of his stepchildren,
his soldiers, and unborn millions of Americans.
</I><BR>
<P>
<HR  width=50%>
Mr. Brookhiser is a senior editor of NR.<BR>
<HR  width=50%>
This article is adapted from <BR>Father of His Country: Rediscovering George Washington,
(c)1996 by Richard Brookhiser,<BR> to be published later this month by The Free Press, an
imprint of Simon & Schuster. <HR  width=50%> </center><P> <FONT SIZE=+3>W</FONT>E speak of
``founding fathers,'' in the plural. Yet there has been only one ``father'' of this country.
National paternity began gravitating to George Washington six months before the Declaration
of Independence, when one Levi Allen addressed him in a letter as ``our political Father.''
The first reference to him as ``Father of His country'' appeared in an almanac in 1778, and
since then the title has been fixed. <P> That title is the greatest barrier to our
appreciation of him now, for never was the comparative term of the metaphor so problematic.
We are not sure what the fathers of families do, much less fathers of countries. The
stereotypical father of the Fifties, who worked till five, then read the paper, has been
replaced by a new stereotype of dad as diaper-changer. But the increased role taken by
fathers in rearing children (by those who actually take one rather than just talk about it)
has been more than offset by the increased number of fathers who have disappeared through
the escape hatch of divorce. Other fathers vanish pre-emptively, by not marrying the mothers
of their children in the first place, while the men who take their places -- stepfathers,
mothers' boyfriends -- are responsible for most of the beating and raping of children that
goes on. Our predicaments have a biological basis. Bearing a child takes nine months of a
mother's life, and through most of that time, she is in touch with what is going on inside
her. She carries the weight, she feels the kicks. Once a child is born, it seems that a
mother is, to some degree, wired to attend to it, however badly she may do the job. None of
this applies to fathers. Conception is a spasm, an incident. The task can be as easily
accomplished by a sperm bank, or a baster. Without a blood test, fathers cannot tell how
many of ``their'' children are their own, while mothers who have not been rigidly faithful
cannot tell who are the fathers of their children. <P> Seneca, whose book of moral essays
Washington owned, was aware of the wispiness of literal fatherhood. ``My father gave me the
benefit of life . . . not knowing to whom . . . It is true, that without a father I could
never have had a being . . . but I do not, therefore, owe my virtue . . . to my nativity. .
. . The generation of me was the least part of the benefit: for, to live is common with the
brutes; but, to live well is the main business.'' If a man does only the biological minimum
required for fatherhood, then he has no role in whether his children live well, or even in
whether they live at all. <P> Fatherhood, as any society understands it, is the result of
training, and an act of will. A man who would be a father in name as well as in fact must go
beyond what is merely natural. A father is a man who follows through. This is why it was
particularly appropriate that Washington came to be known as the father of his country, for
he was the founder, above all others, who followed through. <P> The old historian's parlor
game, whether events make men or men make events (old because most historians long ago gave
the palm to events), seldom considered the option that was always open to historical actors,
which is that of doing nothing at all. If the question is, How many of Washington's public
deeds were thrust upon him by circumstance?, the simplest and truest answer is that none of
them were, for he could always have stayed home. If an entirely private life would have been
too eccentric for a man of his station -- even the retiring George Mason held public office
-- then he could have spent his career in the planters' club of the Virginia legislature. If
he went to the Continental Congress, he need not have taken committee chairmanships, or made
himself available for military service. At the end of his tenure as Commander-in-Chief, he
could have returned home for good, and spent the remainder of his days farming and fussing
with canals. If he went to the Constitutional Convention, he could have sent the document
into the world, and not himself. After one term as President, he could have stepped down.
But always he did the next thing, and then the next. <P> The span of his accumulated
follow-throughs is remarkable. Jefferson, Jackson, Wilson, Reagan, and (we now realize)
Eisenhower were strong Presidents for two terms, with varying degrees of national leadership
before their first elections. Franklin Roosevelt was a leader in peace and war for 12 years.
Lincoln's national career lasted only 7 years, from the Senate race against Stephen Douglas
to his assassination. Washington was the most important man in America, whether he was
onstage or off, for 24 years; for 17 of those years, he was front and center. It is a record
unmatched in our history, scarcely matched in the histories of modern democracies. <P> <FONT
SIZE=+3>W</FONT>ASHINGTON'S record as a ``political Father'' is all the more striking
because his own father, Augustine Washington, seems to have left such a blank in his life.
Augustine was 38 years old when George was born, the first child of his second marriage, and
he died 11 years later. We know nothing bad about Augustine Washington as a father; we also
know nothing good, except for the facts that he sent his two sons by his first marriage to
England to be educated, and that he left his family a substantial estate. The many volumes
of Washington's collected works yield three brief references to him, all unrevealing. <P>
Scanning Washington's life for possible father figures, one finds a few candidates. His
half-brother Lawrence, 14 years older, was a captain in the British army during a forerunner
of the French and Indian War. Lawrence went off to war when George was 8; here may have
begun the lifelong love of uniforms. Later there was Lawrence's father-in-law, William
Fairfax, who employed George as a surveyor, and General Edward Braddock, who commanded him
in the French and Indian War. But they do not seem to have been significant father
substitutes; they do not bulk as large in Washington's life or his recollections as he
himself loomed in the lives of his proteges. <P> Mary Washington, George's mother, left a
more vivid impression, though it is rather grim. In her later years particularly (which
lasted into her son's Presidency) she was stingy with praise and lavish with demands. During
the Revolution, she encouraged a motion in the Virginia legislature to grant her a pension,
which prompted Washington to send the Speaker of the House a mortified letter. ``Before I
left Virginia, I answered all her calls for money, and since that period, have directed my
steward to do the same. Whence her distresses can arise, therefore, I know not . . . she has
not a child that would not divide the last sixpence to relieve her.'' She did give her son
her temper. ``Of the mother,'' a childhood friend of George's recalled, ``I was ten times
more afraid than of my own parents.'' Mary Washington influenced her son's choice of a wife:
Martha Custis, besides being cute, rich, and a shrewd businesswoman, was calm and devoted,
and never gave her husband a moment's trouble. <P> Washington's early life is too misty to
understand the family dynamics. All that stands out is the lack of positively engaging
parental figures, especially paternal ones. <P> Washington never became a parent himself.
Martha Custis was a 27-year-old widow when he married her in 1759, and she had given birth
four times in her first marriage. There is no account of an illegitimate child of
Washington's that is more than graffiti on the bathroom wall of history. The conclusion that
he was sterile is inescapable. <P> >From time to time he tried to escape the conclusion
nevertheless. After he had resigned his commission as Commander-in-Chief in 1783, he wrote
to Congress asking if he could have the paper back, since it might ``serve my grandchildren
some fifty or a hundred years hence for a theme to ruminate upon.'' Both he and Martha were
over fifty, and they had been married for almost a quarter of a century. If they were going
to have any children, they would have had them by then. Still he ruminated. <P> Six years
later, the subject came up again, though in a very different way. In the discarded draft of
his first inaugural, a long and often personal address which Madison persuaded him not to
give, Washington was prepared to acknowledge his childlessness publicly. ``. . . it will be
recollected,'' he wrote, ``that the Divine Providence hath not seen fit, that my blood
should be transmitted or my name perpetuated by the endearing, though sometimes seducing
channel of immediate offspring. I have no child for whom I could wish to make a provision --
no family to build in greatness upon my country's ruins.'' This lack, he argued, made him
more fit to be entrusted with the Presidency. ``Let then the Adversaries to this
Constitution . . . point to the sinister object, or to the earthly consideration beyond the
hope of rendering some little service to our parent country, that could have persuaded me to
accept this appointment.'' Washington's wistful letter to Congress had been written at the
beginning of his sixth decade; as he neared the end of it, he accepted his personal loss,
and though he never gave the speech, in his own mind he transmuted the loss into a political
benefit. <P> The dynastic temptation was very real. The country was lucky that there was so
little material for temptation to work with. Of the first five Presidents, only John Adams
had sons who survived to adulthood. Jefferson, Madison, and Monroe, whose Administrations
covered the first quarter of the nineteenth century, were known as the ``Virginia dynasty,''
but if the seducing channel of immediate (male) offspring had flowed from any of them, the
dynasty might have extended into a second generation. How much more likely was it that this
would have been the case for literal sons of Washington. None of these men would have
tolerated a son becoming President by any means except election. But a gaggle of junior
Washingtons, Jeffersons, Madisons, and Monroes could have crowded the political landscape
intolerably. As it was, John Adams's eldest son, John Quincy Adams, became the sixth
President. <P> Lacking descendants of his own, Washington turned to three substitutes. The
first were his stepchildren and stepgrandchildren. Two of Martha's four children survived
infancy: a daughter, Patsy, who was sickly and died at 17; and a son, Jack, who married and
lived to be 27. Washington worried about Jack's education, writing one tutor that he wanted
him ``fit for more useful purposes, than a horse Racer,'' and he worried about his behavior
when Jack was elected to the Virginia State Senate during the war: ``I do not suppose that
so young a Senator, as you are . . . can yet have much influence in a populous assembly. . .
. But it is in your power to be punctual in your attendance.'' He expended the same anxious
attention on Jack's son, George Washington Parke Custis. But he never considered the Custis
brood his own, and they never considered him theirs. ``. . . his own near relatives feared
to speak or laugh before him,'' remembered Nelly Custis, one of Jack's daughters, ``. . .
not from his severity,'' but out of ``awe and respect. . . . When he entered a room where we
were all mirth and in high conversation, all were instantly mute. He would sit a short time
and then retire, quite nd the army was winding up its affairs, he twice used a striking
phrase. In a letter to a staff officer, he hoped that the ``Peace and Independency for which
we have fought'' would be ``a blessing to Millions yet unborn,'' and in the Circular to the
States, his farewell address as Commander-in-Chief, he warned that ``our fate'' was bound up
with ``the destiny of unborn Millions.'' This was a more particularized image than ``the
destiny of the republican form of government,'' which he would invoke in the version of the
first inaugural address that he actually delivered -- more particularized, and more
personal, even though the persons were unknown, unknowable.     In 1783, as his letter to
Congress showed, he still imagined that the unborn millions might include descendants of his
own. But even if he had been the most prolific father in the world, most of them would be
the posterity of others -- strangers to his blood, as well as strangers to him in time.
Mentioning them was an act of adoption. <P> Six years later, Washington received a printed
sermon, which had been delivered in 1759 by a minister in Maine. Washington got sermons all
the time; when he acknowledged this one, he added that he ``appro[ved] of the doctrine
inculcated.'' The sermon commemorated the death of a Maine hero, Sir William Pepperrell, who
fought in two colonial wars and was made a baronet and a general. The text was from Psalm
82, a short psalm addressed to ``the mighty'' of the earth, which ends by reminding them
that ``ye shall die like men.'' What, when the mighty die, should they have accomplished?
The minister turned for an answer to a funeral oration quoted by Socrates. ``Hereditary
Honor is indeed a noble and splendid Patrimony. But to enjoy a fair Estate, either in Fame
or Money, and for want of a proper Supply of Wealth and Glory of your own, not to be able to
transmit it to your Posterity, is infamous and unmanly.'' The mighty -- the Pepperrells and
the Washingtons -- should pass on as much honor and riches as they had inherited. But to
whom? Hereditary, Patrimony, and Posterity are terms of blood, of literal fathers and
children. General Pepperrell had a son; this part of the sermon had been addressed to him.
General Washington had no sons. But he could ensure that his ``Honor,'' the reflection of
his life lived well, might be a benefit to the millions unborn, his adopted political heirs.
This was a doctrine he could approve of.<P>

<P>
Dear Rusty,
<P>

You'll never believe it! Tipper just gave me the best gift ever -- and it isn't even my
birthday! <P> I was sitting in my study, reading that new book, Primary Colors. It's a new
novel by an anonymous author loosely -- and I mean loosely -- based on our '92 campaign. The
whole town is trying to figure out who wrote the darn thing. Personally, I don't really
care. It's not a funny book. It's a mean book. If Bob Dole wasn't so busy campaigning and if
I wasn't sure that he wasn't on our Clinton-Gore '92 Bus Tour, then I'd be convinced that he
wrote it. <P> Anyway, while I was reading, Tipper wheeled in a giant crate. She giggled
excitedly while I opened it -- it was a HealthRider. Sort of a cross between a see-saw and a
bicycle. <P> ``Tipper!'' I shouted happily. ``This is the best present ever!'' <P> ``I knew
you wanted one,'' she said. <P> ``Wanted one?'' I said. ``Tip, I needed one. Watching those
clips from the State of the Union -- '' <P> ``I know, I know.'' <P> `` -- and listening to
Al Jr. say, 'Who's that fat guy sitting next to Newt Gingrich?' But aren't these things
expensive?'' <P> ``Don't worry about it, Al,'' Tipper said mysteriously. ``I've just had a
little windfall. Pretend like I invested in cattle futures, if it eases your mind.'' <P>
``But why, Tipper? Why the surprise?'' <P> ``Well,'' Tipper said, ``it looks like it's going
to be a long, hard campaign -- '' <P> ``You think I need to shape up for a race against Bob
Dole?'' <P> ``Okay, okay. You look fat, Al. And I don't want to have to let out the waist of
your inauguration trousers.'' <P> ``Okay, then,'' I said. I appreciated Tipper's honesty.
And before I knew it, I was bobbing up and down on the bicycle seat just like they do on the
commercial. It was a cozy Sunday afternoon, and one of the few quiet ones we've had for a
while. The girls were at the library studying for exams, Bill was in New Hampshire at a
pancake breakfast, Hillary was at the office of Wilmer, Cutler, & Pickering, and Al Jr. was
quietly surfing the 'Net until his mother saw the places he was surfing to and put a stop to
it. <P> After about twenty minutes of bouncing up and down, I was pretty tuckered out. So I
collapsed on the couch with Primary Colors. Tipper curled up next to me and read the Sunday
New York Times. <P> ``Primary Colors just hit the bestseller list,'' she said. <P> I
shrugged. I don't really like it when I'm reading and Tipper keeps trying to start a
conversation. It's one of the reasons I haven't been able to get through the Telecom bill.
<P> ``Tipper, do you mind?'' <P> ``I'm sorry.'' <P> ``It's just that I have to finish this
stupid book this afternoon. I don't want to be left out at tomorrow's Cabinet meeting.'' I
went back to reading. <P> Tipper rustled a few pages of the paper. ``Al?'' <P> I looked up,
exasperated. ``What?'' <P> ``What did you mean when you said it was a 'stupid' book? The
critics don't seem to think it's 'stupid.' The Post called it 'winning and lively.' The New
York papers raved. It got nice write-ups in The New Yorker and Time and Newsweek. And it's
selling like hot cakes. And if it gets sold to the movies we're talking some heavy coin.
They have to let the original author write the first draft. So when you say something is
'stupid' you should think first, because a lot of people might think that writing a book
about the environment is stupid and writing a best-selling novel about the '92 presidential
campaign is smart. Especially the author of Primary Colors and her agent, Mort Janklow, who
thinks she's a 'rare comic find.''' <P> ``Excuse me?'' <P> ``Nothing. It's the weather. It's
got me cranky.'' <P> She smiled her wide Tipper smile, and I smiled back because I know how
the weather can ruin a person's mood. It's this damn global warming, Rusty. It's made the
winters cold and the summers hot and the autumns chilly and the springs wet. Where will it
end? <P> I went back to my reading. Tipper suddenly looked up. <P> ``Kim Basinger and Alec
Baldwin!'' she cried. <P> ``What?'' I asked. <P> ``They'll play us in the movie of Primary
Colors!'' <P> ``Tipper, we're not even in the book.'' <P> ``Yeah, well, we'll be in the
movie.'' <P> And she raced off, leaving me in peace to finish the book. I'm sorry, Rusty.
It's just not funny. And I know funny. <P> Your Pal,  Al <P> </body> </html>

NEW YORK, JANUARY 30
<P>
The bipartisan Council on Crime in America, whose most conspicuous spokesman is William
Bennett, does fine work, but when it touches on the matter of drugs its analytical powers
simply decompose, as though the writer were high on crack cocaine or the legal stuff. <P>
Last week the Council exploded in opposition to the call for an approach to the legalization
of drugs made by seven writers (myself included) in this journal. To the title of the
symposium -- ``The War on Drugs Is Lost'' -- the Council replies that that is most certainly
not so. To the end of proving this, it cites the reduction of drug use by non-addicts. It
declined by 50 per cent between 1979 and 1992. The planted axiom of course is that that
decline is owing to the war on drugs. But what is it that accounts for the decline in the
number of users of tobacco during the same period, from 33.5 million to 26.5 million? The
use of tobacco is not illegal. But since 1979, and beginning even before that, the
deleterious effect of cigarettes was so persuasively argued that even William Bennett gave
up smoking. <P> A look at the formal side of the war on drugs is required. If something is
illegal, then the law that makes it so is effective to the extent that it imprisons those
who violate it, thereby hypothetically reducing the number of lawbreakers. <P> That would
seem obvious, but isn't to the distinguished members of the Council on Crime in America. In
1985, 811,000 arrests were made for drug offenses. In 1994, 1.35 million arrests were made
for drug offenses. Does that mean that the war on drugs is effective? Well, no. An effective
law diminishes, rather than increases, the number of violators who have to be arrested. <P>
And then of course one asks, If 1.35 million drug users were arrested in 1994, how many drug
users were not arrested? The Council informs us that there are more than 4 million casual
users of cocaine (defined as people who use it less than once a week). How so? Why haven't
they been arrested? And goes on to say that there are over 2.2 million heavy (at least
weekly) users. That makes a total of 6.2 million who violate the law from once a week, to
every two weeks or so. How effective is the war when such figures can be cited? Now take the
big one. There are over 70 million Americans who have smoked marijuana, and about 10 million
who continue to do so. Why aren't they in jail? Does the Council on Crime in America really
wish that they were in jail? <P> It must have embarrassed the Council that the same week it
sputtered forth on the great success of the war on drugs, The Economist cited another
Council report on crime in America which gainsays its entire position on the drug war. We
learn that only one criminal is jailed for every hundred violent crimes committed; that over
one-half of America's convicted felons are not sentenced to prison (because, in part, the
prisons are full); that the most violent criminals serve less than one-half their sentences,
and the average murderer released in 1992 from a state prison had served only 5.9 years. <P>
The Economist cites the experience of a patrolman in Haughville, a scruffy area of
Indianapolis. ``He drives up and down in the evenings, past anoraked figures who stand
outside liquor stores and turn their faces from him. He can guess what they are; few people
apart from drug dealers stand around on nights like this, when the puddles in the potholes
freeze hard. Besides, Patrolman Reichle knows most of them: he reckons he has arrested one
in five of these young men.'' City prosecutors ``do not even bring charges against drug
dealers until they have been arrested several times. Those who do get charged and found
guilty will not go to prison, unless they have other convictions. President Bill Clinton's
call for a crackdown on drug dealers sounds pretty hollow in Haughville.'' <P> Such is
overcrowding in state prisons in Indiana -- notwithstanding that the national increase in
prison space is threefold since we decided to wage hard war on drugs -- that even a
relatively new American prison might have merited describing by Charles Dickens. ``Prisoners
pass their days in narrow, ill-lit cages; there are no chairs or tables, so the men pace up
and down like zoo animals or slouch upon the floor.'' <P> So what has the war done? It has
made a mockery of an anti-drug law that is simply ignored by millions; it has induced
violent felonies in pursuit of drug profits; and it is self-evidently powerless to do
anything about the recent increase in marijuana use by reckless adolescents. It is a pity
that men and women of the moral and intellectual character of William Bennett treat drug
legalization as the equivalent of moral acquiescence in drug abuse, when other reasons for
repealing our stupid laws are so clearly articulated, primary among them to relieve non-drug
users from the heavy load they bear in the phony and ineffective war. One forgets -- who won
the Hundred Years War back then? Was it really necessary to take it on for one hundred
years? <P>

<h2>The Week</h2>
<hr></center>
<P>

<p><li>
Scientists have found the so-called missing mass of the universe, the invisible matter that shapes galaxies. It was discovered in a cardboard box inside a closet at the White House.

<p><li>It's time for Republicans to beat a strategic retreat on the balanced budget. Any attempt in the House to stick it to the President with so-called ``targeted appropriations'' -- bills that fund Republican priorities, but not those of the Democrats (AmeriCorps, the Commerce Department) -- will appear vindictive, rather than simply economy-oriented. And the President will just veto the bills. Nor should Republicans give Mr. Clinton a reason to paint them as ``extremists'' by playing politics with the debt limit. The GOP's best option is to pass a continuing resolution funding the government for the rest of the year at levels low enough that they can say they have cut spending as much as could be done with a recalcitrant Democrat in the White House. Then they should put the budget behind them. Republicans can continue to slam the Clinton budget proposal as dishonest, but only within the context of a wide-ranging assault on the President designed to collect as many vetoes (or Senate filibusters) on tough issues as possible. In keeping with this strategy, the GOP's work on welfare should be considered complete. Clinton already sided with ``welfare as we know it'' with his veto of a weak reform bill this month. Why give him a second chance? Next, he should be made to declare himself on affirmative action, English as the official language, third-trimester abortions, and all the other issues pushed aside by the GOP's year-long effort to balance the books. The more chances Republicans give Clinton to obstruct popular legislation unacceptable to his liberal base, the more likely voters are to veto him in November. After that the ``revolution'' can begin in earnest.

<p><li>In a speech to the Cato Institute, Sen. Phil Gramm became the first candidate in the presidential race to offer a comprehensive economic agenda. Gramm promises to balance the budget in his first term and, if re-elected, to start paying back the national debt. He proposes a flat tax set at 16 per cent; if his policies spark so much economic growth that federal revenues threaten to increase ahead of schedule, the rate would be cut still further. He would repeal the estate and gift taxes and work to reduce regulations to free trade. Flat-tax purists will not be perfectly satisfied -- Gramm would not abolish the deductions for mortgage interest and charitable giving, as Steve Forbes does. And where Forbes would eliminate capital-gains taxes, Gramm would apply the 16 per cent rate to them after adjusting for inflation. But if enacted, Gramm's proposal would still provide the most favorable treatment of capital in recent history. And it's the most politically attractive reform plan around. By retaining the two deductions and by taxing investment income at the individual level rather than at the business level, Gramm cuts off openings for liberal attacks while sacrificing little of substance. Any candidate who wants to offer a different plan is going to have a tough act to follow.

<p><li>Tax-policy wonks were recently treated to the rarest of rarities: a controlled experiment in supply-side theory. In 1993 the top federal income-tax rate for the highest-income families ($250,000+) was increased from 31 per cent to 39.6 per cent. The income cap on Medicare taxes was also eliminated, effectively tacking on another 2.9 per cent. By contrast, income-tax rates on the middle-income group ($50,000 to $200,000) didn't change. So we have, in effect, two test tubes -- tax hike, and no tax hike -- with everything else held constant. The results? Gross income of the ``tax hike'' highest bracket fell $31 billion short of the level it would have reached had it kept pace with the gross income of the ``no tax hike'' middle-brackets in 1993. So instead of collecting an extra $16 billion, Uncle Sam received just $5 billion, according to a National Bureau of Economic Research study. By earning less, highest earners have pushed a larger share of federal taxes onto the backs of the rest of us.

<p><li>President Clinton toyed with a core belief that he would like to punch columnist William Safire in the nose for calling Miz Hillary a congenital liar. He has not yet expressed any core belief about punching out columnists Suzanne Fields, Georgie Anne Geyer, and Mona Charen, among others who concluded Miz Hillary was you-know-whatting about her role in Travelgate and Whitewater.

<p><li>A while back Nina Totenberg of National Public Radio said that ``if there is retributive justice,'' Jesse Helms will ``get AIDS from a transfusion, or one of his grandchildren will get it.'' The tireless Arnold Beichman has found a source for her moral reasoning. After the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, the anti-nuclear activist Dr. Helen Caldicott told a reporter that ``the accident should have happened here. I hate to say that as a physician, but unless there are thousands of American martyrs, nothing will be done.'' Dr. Caldicott has disappeared since the end of the Cold War. Maybe Nina Totenberg could find out where, and join her.

<p><li>It is the conventional wisdom of welfare reformers across the political spectrum that people on welfare must move to the work force. The problem is that welfare pays too well for most of them to afford to work. The latest Cato Institute Policy Report shows that in New York City welfare provides the equivalent of an hourly pre-tax wage of $14.75 (it's $11.35 in Baltimore and $10.90 in Detroit). In 40 states welfare pays more than $8.00 an hour, and in 17 states more than $10 an hour. In 9 states welfare pays more than the average first-year salary of a schoolteacher, and in 29 states more than the average starting pay of a secretary. In 47 states it pays more than a janitor gets. In the 6 most generous states a first-year computer programmer would be better off on welfare. How many NR readers would be better off on welfare? And would they use the extra cash to buy subscriptions for friends?

<p><li>An observant reader notes an apparent contradiction among NR editors. Contributing Editor Stephen Moore argues in NR (December 25) that Republicans are losing the budget battle because Federal Government spending will continue to increase in dollar terms. Senior Editor Peter Brimelow, with help from NR Economics Analyst Ed Rubenstein, argued in Forbes (December 18) that Republicans are winning because federal spending will fall as a share of the economy (at least 3 percentage points of Gross Domestic Product between 1995 and 2005 -- both in the Republican and in the White House plans). Who's right? Both. Dollars spent are important because there's no absolute reason why spending should move pari passu with GDP. But the Federal Government's share of GDP is the ultimate issue, because it measures Washington's stultifying effect. Now all we need is for those out-year forecasts to be something like accurate.

<p><li>The presidential campaign, as George Will remarked, is generating more detailed policy arguments than usual. Yet the recent Republican debates have been remarkably unedifying, with most of the cheap shots aimed at Steve Forbes and his flat tax. (See ``On the Right,'' p. 62.) The low point of the Iowa debate came when Lamar Alexander trashed Forbes for having raised the price of his magazine. Far worse than the unfairness to Forbes is the possibility that the rumble could bury tax reform as an issue. Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform has sent an open letter to the candidates reminding them that in ``a similar heated primary season not long ago, one candidate's unfortunate remarks about 'voodoo economics' did incalculable damage to the party over a period of years and contributed to a climate of distrust that ultimately doomed a Presidency.'' Ronald Reagan's 11th Commandment was meant to protect the climate of opinion, as much as personalities.

<p><li>The House and Senate have reconciled their versions of the FY1996 defense authorization bill, but only at the price of significant concessions by the House conferees. The commitment to deploy a multiple-site ground-based national defense against ballistic missiles by the year 2003 has been dropped, as were restrictions on the President's freedom to dispatch U.S. troops under UN command. The Administration will be cheered by these concessions. Meanwhile, also on the defense front, some liberals have started once again casting their eye on the defense budget as a place to raid for funds for domestic programs. It won't fly. This year's defense appropriation (already signed into law) puts spending at about $265 billion. That's 40 per cent below the 1985 level in real terms, and a little over 3 per cent of GDP -- lower than at any time since before Pearl Harbor. We've cut enough.

<p><li>The uproar over the World Trade Organization's ruling against the United States for differential pricing is embarrassing. If ever they ruled against us motivated by reasoning manifestly tendentious, then that would be the time to tell the court -- and, for that matter, GATT -- to go to hell. But when you join in a conference to set the speed limit and proceed to exceed that limit, you should expect to be stopped, and should be stopped. The principal beneficiary of free trade is the American people, and it is for that reason that Congress and Presidents Reagan, Bush, and Clinton entered into a convenant whose executive arm should have no alternative than to rule on the facts, which the court did.

<p><li>Secretary of State Warren Christopher mentioned in passing in a Harvard speech on January 18 that admission of the Central European democracies into NATO would proceed ``on a roughly parallel track'' with their entry into the European Union. But linking the NATO and EU timetables for admitting new members only slows down the NATO process, since the EU, at its December meeting in Madrid, put off the beginning of any such membership talks until 1998 at the earliest. This is another sop to Russia and another slap in the face for the Central Europeans.

<p><li>Disturbing evidence continues to surface of discrimination on Death Row. Guinevere A. Garcia, an inmate in Illinois, made news by publicly pleading to be put to death. (Gov. Edgar ultimately commuted her sentence.) As Professor Victor Streib told the New York Times, ``We've sentenced 112 women to death since 1973 and only executed one. . . . It was nearly a joke in the business that for a woman to get executed she would have to volunteer, and that's what's happening now.'' If there is any merit in the call for more executions of white men to bring that statistic in line with the figure for black men, then there should be many, many more executions of women, black and white. America executes thirty or forty people a year, all men. If enough women to make up the difference can't be found languishing on Death Row, the obvious solution is to extend the death penalty to lesser offenses than murder. Since women don't commit rape very often, we'd be willing to consider littering, driving too slowly on the freeway, and eating peanuts from supermarket bins without paying for them as new capital crimes. Let Justice reign and flourish through the land, nor youth, nor charms divert her iron hand.

<p><li>A social-service inspector in England has acted, censuring a vicar who operates a day-care center. His offense? There are no black dolls for the kiddies. They do have one or two yellow dolls, who represent the Sino-Japanese community. But even though there are no black children in this center, the inspector reminded the vicar, there are black children elsewhere, and so this affront to multiculture must cease. And then there was the church ceremony in Coventry intended to honor the automobile. An 1897 Daimler sputtered its way down the aisle, but its exhaust nearly asphyxiated the congregation. They recovered, only to succumb again when a young woman stripped naked, a la Lady Godiva, the better to make her point, which was a naked protest against the ravages of the motor car. The madness is not entirely domestic.

<p><li>Heard from the Greens: Now that two of the last three winters have proved colder, icier, and snowier than any others in the last half-century, there can no longer be any doubt about the reality of global warming.

<p><li>What did Hillary know, and when did she shred it?

<h2>THE WAR ON DRUGS IS LOST</h2>
<hr></center>
<P>



The following is an excerpt from a symposium that appears in the Febuary 12th issue of the magazine
 
<p>
<p>NATIONAL REVIEW has attempted during its tenure as, so to speak, keeper of the conservative tablets to analyze public problems and to recommend intelligent thought. The magazine has acknowledged a variety of positions by right-minded thinkers and analysts who sometimes reach conflicting conclusions about public policy. As recently as on the question of troops to Bosnia, there was dissent within the family from our corporate conclusion that we'd be best off staying home.
<p>For many years we have published analyses of the drug problem. An important and frequently cited essay by Professor Michael Gazzaniga (Feb. 5, 1990) brought a scientist's discipline into the picture, shedding light on matters vital to an understanding of the drug question. He wrote, for instance, about different rates of addiction, and about ambient pressures that bear on addiction. Elsewhere, Professor James Q. Wilson, now of UCLA, has written eloquently in defense of the drug war. Milton Friedman from the beginning said it would not work, and would do damage.
<p>We have found Dr. Gazzaniga and others who have written on the subject persuasive in arguing that the weight of the evidence is against the current attempt to prohibit drugs. But NATIONAL REVIEW has not, until now, opined formally on the subject. We do so at this point. To put off a declarative judgment would be morally and intellectually weak-kneed.
<p>Things being as they are, and people as they are, there is no way to prevent somebody, somewhere, from concluding that ``NATIONAL REVIEW favors drugs.'' We don't; we deplore their use; we urge the stiffest feasible sentences against anyone convicted of selling a drug to a minor. But that said, it is our judgment that the war on drugs has failed, that it is diverting intelligent energy away from how to deal with the problem of addiction, that it is wasting our resources, and that it is encouraging civil, judicial, and penal procedures associated with police states. We all agree on movement toward legalization, even though we may differ on just how far.
<p>We are joined in our judgment by Ethan A. Nadelmann, a scholar and researcher; Kurt Schmoke, a mayor and former prosecutor; Joseph D. McNamara, a former police chief; Robert W. Sweet, a federal judge and former prosecutor; Thomas Szasz, a psychiatrist; and Steven B. Duke, a law professor. Each has his own emphases, as one might expect. All agree that the celebrated war has failed, and that it is time to go home, and to mobilize fresh thought on the drug problem in the context of a free society. This symposium is our contribution to such thought.
<p>  -- THE EDITORS

**********************************************

<H3>1. Wm. F. Buckley Jr.</h3>
<p><i>Last summer WFB was asked by the New York Bar Association to make a statement to the panel of lawyers considering the drug question. He made the following statement:
</i>
<p>WE ARE speaking of a plague that consumes an estimated $75 billion per year of public money, exacts an estimated $70 billion a year from consumers, is responsible for nearly 50 per cent of the million Americans who are today in jail, occupies an estimated 50 per cent of the trial time of our judiciary, and takes the time of 400,000 policemen -- yet a plague for which no cure is at hand, nor in prospect.
<p>Perhaps you, ladies and gentlemen of the Bar, will understand it if I chronicle my own itinerary on the subject of drugs and public policy. When I ran for mayor of New York, the political race was jocular, but the thought given to municipal problems was entirely serious, and in my paper on drugs and in my post-election book I advocated their continued embargo, but on unusual grounds. I had read -- and I think the evidence continues to affirm it -- that drug-taking is a gregarious activity. What this means, I said, is that an addict is in pursuit of company and therefore attempts to entice others to share with him his habit. Under the circumstances, I said, it can reasonably be held that drug-taking is a contagious disease and, accordingly, subject to the conventional restrictions employed to shield the innocent from Typhoid Mary. Some sport was made of my position by libertarians, including Professor Milton Friedman, who asked whether the police might legitimately be summoned if it were established that keeping company with me was a contagious activity.
<p>I recall all of this in search of philosophical perspective. Back in 1965 I sought to pay conventional deference to libertarian presumptions against outlawing any activity potentially harmful only to the person who engages in that activity. I cited John Stuart Mill and, while at it, opined that there was no warrant for requiring motorcyclists to wear a helmet. I was seeking, and I thought I had found, a reason to override the presumption against intercession by the state.
<p>About ten years later, I deferred to a different allegiance, this one not the presumptive opposition to state intervention, but a different order of priorities. A conservative should evaluate the practicality of a legal constriction, as for instance in those states whose statute books continue to outlaw sodomy, which interdiction is unenforceable, making the law nothing more than print-on-paper. I came to the conclusion that the so-called war against drugs was not working, that it would not work absent a change in the structure of the civil rights to which we are accustomed and to which we cling as a valuable part of our patrimony. And that therefore if that war against drugs is not working, we should look into what effects the war has, a canvass of the casualties consequent on its failure to work. That consideration encouraged me to weigh utilitarian principles: the Benthamite calculus of pain and pleasure introduced by the illegalization of drugs.A YEAR or so ago I thought to calculate a ratio, however roughly arrived at, toward the elaboration of which I would need to place a dollar figure on deprivations that do not lend themselves to quantification. Yet the law, lacking any other recourse, every day countenances such quantifications, as when asking a jury to put a dollar figure on the damage done by the loss of a plaintiff's right arm, amputated by defective machinery at the factory. My enterprise became allegorical in character -- I couldn't do the arithmetic -- but the model, I think, proves useful in sharpening perspectives.
<p>Professor Steven Duke of Yale Law School, in his valuable book, America's Longest War: Rethinking Our Tragic Crusade against Drugs, and scholarly essay, ``Drug Prohibition: An Unnatural Disaster,'' reminds us that it isn't the use of illegal drugs that we have any business complaining about, it is the abuse of such drugs. It is acknowledged that tens of millions of Americans (I have seen the figure 85 million) have at one time or another consumed, or exposed themselves to, an illegal drug. But the estimate authorized by the federal agency charged with such explorations is that there are not more than 1 million regular cocaine users, defined as those who have used the drug at least once in the preceding week. There are (again, an informed estimate) 5 million Americans who regularly use marijuana; and again, an estimated 70 million who once upon a time, or even twice upon a time, inhaled marijuana. From the above we reasonably deduce that Americans who abuse a drug, here defined as Americans who become addicted to it or even habituated to it, are a very small percentage of those who have experimented with a drug, or who continue to use a drug without any observable distraction in their lives or careers. About such users one might say that they are the equivalent of those Americans who drink liquor but do not become alcoholics, or those Americans who smoke cigarettes but do not suffer a shortened lifespan as a result.
<p>Curiosity naturally flows to ask, next, How many users of illegal drugs in fact die from the use of them? The answer is complicated in part because marijuana finds itself lumped together with cocaine and heroin, and nobody has ever been found dead from marijuana. The question of deaths from cocaine is complicated by the factor of impurity. It would not be useful to draw any conclusions about alcohol consumption, for instance, by observing that, in 1931, one thousand Americans died from alcohol consumption if it happened that half of those deaths, or more than half, were the result of drinking alcohol with toxic ingredients extrinsic to the drug as conventionally used. When alcohol was illegal, the consumer could never know whether he had been given relatively harmless alcohol to drink -- such alcoholic beverages as we find today in the liquor store -- or whether the bootlegger had come up with paralyzing rotgut. By the same token, purchasers of illegal cocaine and heroin cannot know whether they are consuming a drug that would qualify for regulated consumption after clinical analysis.
<p>But we do know this, and I approach the nexus of my inquiry, which is that more people die every year as a result of the war against drugs than die from what we call, generically, overdosing. These fatalities include, perhaps most prominently, drug merchants who compete for commercial territory, but include also people who are robbed and killed by those desperate for money to buy the drug to which they have become addicted.
<p>This is perhaps the moment to note that the pharmaceutical cost of cocaine and heroin is approximately 2 per cent of the street price of those drugs. Since a cocaine addict can spend as much as $1,000 per week to sustain his habit, he would need to come up with that $1,000. The approximate fencing cost of stolen goods is 80 per cent, so that to come up with $1,000 can require stealing $5,000 worth of jewels, cars, whatever. We can see that at free-market rates, $20 per week would provide the addict with the cocaine which, in this wartime drug situation, requires of him $1,000.
<p>My mind turned, then, to auxiliary expenses -- auxiliary pains, if you wish. The crime rate, whatever one made of its modest curtsy last year toward diminution, continues its secular rise. Serious crime is 480 per cent higher than in 1965. The correlation is not absolute, but it is suggestive: crime is reduced by the number of available enforcers of law and order, namely policemen. The heralded new crime legislation, passed last year and acclaimed by President Clinton, provides for 100,000 extra policemen, even if only for a limited amount of time. But 400,000 policemen would be freed to pursue criminals engaged in activity other than the sale and distribution of drugs if such sale and distribution, at a price at which there was no profit, were to be done by, say, a federal drugstore.
<p>So then we attempt to put a value on the goods stolen by addicts. The figure arrived at by Professor Duke is $10 billion. But we need to add to this pain of stolen property, surely, the extra-material pain suffered by victims of robbers. If someone breaks into your house at night, perhaps holding you at gunpoint while taking your money and your jewelry and whatever, it is reasonable to assign a higher ``cost'' to the episode than the commercial value of the stolen money and jewelry. If we were modest, we might reasonably, however arbitrarily, put at $1,000 the ``value'' of the victim's pain. But then the hurt, the psychological trauma, might be evaluated by a jury at ten times, or one hundred times, that sum.
<p>But we must consider other factors, not readily quantifiable, but no less tangible. Fifty years ago, to walk at night across Central Park was no more adventurous than to walk down Fifth Avenue. But walking across the park is no longer done, save by the kind of people who climb the Matterhorn. Is it fair to put a value on a lost amenity? If the Metropolitan Museum were to close, mightn't we, without fear of distortion, judge that we had been deprived of something valuable? What value might we assign to confidence that, at night, one can sleep without fear of intrusion by criminals seeking money or goods exchangeable for drugs?
<p>Pursuing utilitarian analysis, we ask: What are the relative costs, on the one hand, of medical and psychological treatment for addicts and, on the other, incarceration for drug offenses? It transpires that treatment is seven times more cost-effective. By this is meant that one dollar spent on the treatment of an addict reduces the probability of continued addiction seven times more than one dollar spent on incarceration. Looked at another way: Treatment is not now available for almost half of those who would benefit from it. Yet we are willing to build more and more jails in which to isolate drug users even though at one-seventh the cost of building and maintaining jail space and pursuing, detaining, and prosecuting the drug user, we could subsidize commensurately effective medical care and psychological treatment.I HAVE spared you, even as I spared myself, an arithmetical consummation of my inquiry, but the data here cited instruct us that the cost of the drug war is many times more painful, in all its manifestations, than would be the licensing of drugs combined with intensive education of non-users and intensive education designed to warn those who experiment with drugs. We have seen a substantial reduction in the use of tobacco over the last thirty years, and this is not because tobacco became illegal but because a sentient community began, in substantial numbers, to apprehend the high cost of tobacco to human health, even as, we can assume, a growing number of Americans desist from practicing unsafe sex and using polluted needles in this age of AIDS. If 80 million Americans can experiment with drugs and resist addiction using information publicly available, we can reasonably hope that approximately the same number would resist the temptation to purchase such drugs even if they were available at a federal drugstore at the mere cost of production.
<p>And added to the above is the point of civil justice. Those who suffer from the abuse of drugs have themselves to blame for it. This does not mean that society is absolved from active concern for their plight. It does mean that their plight is subordinate to the plight of those citizens who do not experiment with drugs but whose life, liberty, and property are substantially affected by the illegalization of the drugs sought after by the minority.
<p>I have not spoken of the cost to our society of the astonishing legal weapons available now to policemen and prosecutors; of the penalty of forfeiture of one's home and property for violation of laws which, though designed to advance the war against drugs, could legally be used -- I am told by learned counsel -- as penalties for the neglect of one's pets. I leave it at this, that it is outrageous to live in a society whose laws tolerate sending young people to life in prison because they grew, or distributed, a dozen ounces of marijuana. I would hope that the good offices of your vital profession would mobilize at least to protest such excesses of wartime zeal, the legal equivalent of a My Lai massacre. And perhaps proceed to recommend the legalization of the sale of most drugs, except to minors.

<h2>Rusty</h2>

<P>



Well, Tipper was right again! She told me this morning that if I cleaned out the basement, I'd be surprised by what turned up. So down I went with a box and a mess of recyclable trash bags and a reluctant Al Jr. And boy! do we Gores have a messy basement!
<P>But since it's snowing like the dickens out and since Al Jr.'s soccer game (St. Alban's vs. Calvert) was called off due to snowdrifts five feet high (the tallest kid on Al's team is 4'11"), the Gore men weren't that unhappy to do some early spring cleaning.
<P>We found the usual basement stuff: solar hats, earth brick molds, planetary communication panels, that kind of thing. But behind a box of copies of Earth in the Balance, we found a box of notes that look like they could belong to you -- they're handwritten, and written in some form of scientific notation, I think; at least, I can't make heads or tails out of it:
<P>2/23/93
<br>HRC -- v. upst. Scrmng. Rd fcd. Snrlng. Thrwng lmp @ potus.
<br>Wnts WHTrvl Offc ``hng out 2 dry.''
<br>Hrry Thmsn nds $$$$$$ for trvl/chrtr/whtevr.
<br>$$$$$$$ more $$$$$$$ more $$$$$$$.
<p>Does any of that make sense to you? It looks to me like some kind of complicated photosynthesis thing.
<p>We also found a stack of computer printouts. Here's one of them.
<br>RSE LW FRM -- BILLING/PROJECT CODE/HRS
<br>HRC -- WhtWtr/CstlGrnd/McDgl/et al -- 110 hrs @ $350 
<br>HRC -- rprsntg WhtWtr to Gov -- 110 hrs @ $350
<p>These go on and on. Stacks and stacks of them. Could they be the baby-sitting ledger for one of the girls?
<p>And then we found some more handwritten notes.
<p>9/12/93

<br>Mttng ends. No actn tkn.
<p>Does any of that make sense to you, Rusty? Could it be something the Quayles forgot to take?
<p>The strange thing is, I was just down here a few weeks ago and I didn't notice all of this junk cluttering the place up. And when Tipper ordered me to clean up the basement, it was like she knew that all of these boxes and papers were here, even though as far as I know, she hasn't been down here for ages. 
<p>``What's down there, Tip?'' I asked.
<p>``Our last hope,'' she said. You know women, Rusty. It's like they have some kind of sixth sense for housecleaning. 
<p>The next thing that turned up was a computer disk, which Al Jr. happily ``hacked'' his way into. The screen on his laptop just sprang alive -- numbers and figures zooming by. All I caught was: 
<p>TO: B.C. & H.R.C.
<p>FR: H.Th. & L. B-Th. 
<p>Attached please find profit projections for Air Thomason, Inc. Please initial and route to M. McL. and D. Watkins. 
<p>Then some sort of spreadsheet program began, and the numbers kept getting larger and larger.
<p>And the last scrap of paper -- and this one really might be important -- 
<p>IOU $30,000 for re-election Gov. Ark.
<p>Redeemable in cash or in kind.
<p>I'm tempted to recycle most of this -- we should be encouraging people to e-mail whenever they can, and so if whoever it belongs to comes back looking for it, well, let them learn the hard way.
<p>There was also a giant box of computer diskettes, but I gave them all to Al Jr., who's merrily erasing them so he can use them to save his ``Zoop'' games.
<p>I still haven't decided what to do with all of this paper, though. Maybe I'll ask Tipper to handle it. After all, she's the one who sent me down here in the first place. She'll know what to do with
it.

Forbes's Rich Problem
<p>
NEW YORK, JANUARY 16
<p>Steve Forbes's campaign is revealing, challenging, and amusing. The sheer improbability, last 
November, that he would get anywhere tended to interdict any other consideration of his candidacy,
 yet here he is, running second in various states. In the debate in Iowa on Saturday the other 
candidates all consolidated as a Get Forbes posse. He escaped, but bruises landed, inflicted by 
fellow Republicans, of course, and, in many cases, fellow conservatives. 
<p>He has split the 
conservative vote, and, accordingly, Senator Gramm went after him lustily. This was in part a 
professional obligation (there is no way Phil Gramm can stop Dole and share affections with Steve 
Forbes) and in part personal (Senator Gramm is smarting from Forbes's ads).
<p>Forbes has of course 
been baiting Gramm in a television and radio campaign that has suffused Iowa with Forbes's agenda. 
His complaint is that Gramm's insistence on a reduction in government expenses pays insufficient 
heed to the possibilities that open up under a return to supply-side policies. Gramm counters that 
you can't have effective tax relief without asphyxiative government policies that would hugely 
reduce government expenditures. Without exactly saying so, Forbes resists this, preferring to 
cite the prodigality of growth when the yokes are removed from the taxpayers' necks. 
It is a nice quarrel, and conservatives tend to hope that both sides will win.
<p> Now the special vulnerabilities of Forbes on the larger political scene are 
difficult for such as Phil Gramm and Pat Buchanan and indeed Lamar Alexander to 
cope with. His company has a private airplane blissfully named Capitalist Tool. 
And his company has a gorgeous big yacht, which will take you around the world, 
if you press the right button. Now the Internal Revenue Service, over the years, has 
examined the expense accounts of these two amenities with ferocious attention, but the 
records absolutely establish a business purpose in maintaining them. The primary weight 
of their expense rests on the shoulders of the stockholders, who are the Forbes family. 
<p>There is that, plus also the general political disability of disposing of great wealth. 
The public doesn't find this disqualifying -- FDR was relatively rich -- and anyway, right-wing 
inclinations do not go in lockstep with wealth. (Bill Gates voted for Clinton.) In 1958 there were 
three contenders for statewide office in New York. Averell Harriman was standard-bearer of the left
 wing of the Democratic Party; challenger Nelson Rockefeller was standard-bearer of the left wing 
of the Republican Party; Corliss Lamont was, pure and simple, a Communist fellow-traveler running
 on a socialist ticket. All three gentlemen were heirs to great fortunes. 
<p>So that the Republican
 public, in a Republican primary, is not going to be frightened off by the documentation of Steve 
Forbes's wealth. It is a slightly different matter that he has put that wealth entirely at the 
disposal of his campaign. That understandably irritates those poor souls who have to spend half 
of every day collecting nickels and dimes from house to house; but there is no indication that the 
public is put off on the matter, although there may be a considerable difference between the cited 
popularity of Steve Forbes and the number of people who will actually turn up to vote for him. 
<p>His primary problem has to do with the widespread belief that a flat tax would hurt the middle 
class, specifically, those who earn between $70,000 and $200,000. Forbes acknowledges that for the 
first year, perhaps two years, taxing families with incomes over $36,000 at 17 per cent, 
disallowing deductions, and immunizing dividend and estate income would mean a deficit, but 
one which, he vows, would soon disappear under the promptings of an invigorated marketplace. 
But of course the first thing done by the other candidates and their accomplices was to try to 
figure out how much less this would hypothetically cost Steve Forbes personally, compared with 
what they figure out he paid last year. 
<p>The estimated saving is substantial. Forbes was 
justifiably inflamed at the preposterous suggestion that someone is going to run for President of 
the United States in order to spur on a tax reform that will save the new President money on his 
income tax. The gentle Steve Forbes waxed wroth on the point and retorted that he will have spent 
twenty times the hypothetical saving on his presidential campaign. A rather convincing point: It 
doesn't really make sense to spend $20 million in a campaign in order prospectively to diminish 
one's tax payments by about $200,000. Some will remember the character in the Hollywood movie 
whom the all-powerful, manipulative gang offered either of two alternative posts: Commissioner 
of Baseball, or President of the United States. William Powell paused, twitched his moustache, 
then said, ``Which pays more?'' 
<p>Mr. Forbes isn't playing a political part, isn't going to be 
President, but he has done an endearing thing.

<center>
<h2>The Week</h2>
<hr></center>
<P>


<p>
<li>


Severe weather last week forced the cancellation of thousands of flights, most of them Hazel O'Leary's.


<p>
<li>


Even the arcane election laws of New York State have not prevented Steve Forbes and Pat Buchanan from collecting enough petition signatures to get on the presidential primary ballot. Provided they surmount one last hurdle: the efforts of the state party machine, which backs Bob Dole, to disqualify them. New York's laws give gimlet-eyed regulars so many opportunities to challenge signatures that petitioners are advised to collect twice as many as the already extravagantly high legal requirement. Dole knows these rules well, for they were used to keep him out of the New York primary in 1988, when the Bush forces ran the state GOP. But this is playground justice, not justice. New York Republicans should be able to vote their preference. And wouldn't it be fun to watch Forbes and Buchanan returning each other's serves in a New York match-up? (Dole could take the role of the net.)


<p>
<li>


After a few weeks of ``crisis'' and media interviews of whining federal workers suffering speakably on paid leave, someone started the whole thing up again, and the next thing you know, you get your Form 1040 in the mail.



<p>
<li>

Just as Nixon has Oliver Stone, so Pat Buchanan, Nixon's old speechwriter, has Charles Lane, whose profile of Mr. Buchanan (``Daddy's Boy'') ornaments a recent issue of The New Republic. Lane finds the source of Buchanan's pathologies in his twisted family roots: Catholic dad, Franco-lover, walloped his kids, etc., etc. As it happens, the worst that can be said about Buchanan's brawling youth was said by Buchanan himself, with candor and charm, in his memoir, Right from the Beginning. So Lane has to reach further, exhuming old quarrels with neighbors and trotting out that classic of politics masquerading as science, Theodor Adorno's The Authoritarian Personality. In the authoritarian personality, Lane quotes, ``there is no place for ambivalence or ambiguities.'' That's Pat! But then, five pages later, when Lane asks Buchanan about some of the liberal policies he had to swallow working for the Nixon White House, such as the opening to China, Buchanan says, ``You know, I'm ambivalent about that.'' Lane doesn't take the hint (he lacks Stone's empathy) but maybe there are sparks of goodness in Buchanan after all.

<p>
<li>



The White House announced that President Clinton was considering putting himself out of work for the shutdown and taking no pay, to show his sympathy for furloughed federal workers. Then some whiz must have noticed that this would have put the President in the ``non-essential worker'' category. The story quickly and quietly disappeared.



<p>
<li>

Perhaps Bill Clinton is running for re-election because he must, says Mark R. Levin of Landmark Legal Foundation. Levin reminds us that Mr. Clinton is the first President to claim attorney - client privilege, which he did in hopes of preventing congressional investigators from learning about his Whitewater activities. He is the first President to assert executive privilege against himself, which occurred when his own deputy attorney general was stopped by his own White House counsel from examining the late Vincent Foster's files. He is the first President to receive legal aid from the taxpayers by using government lawyers for his personal legal matters, a practice previous Presidents considered unlawful. And Mr. Clinton is the only President to demand absolute immunity from all civil lawsuits -- even where the suit involves matters alleged to have occurred prior to his election to the Presidency -- which is intended to prevent a trial on charges that he sexually molested a former Arkansas state employee. If Clinton loses the Presidency, he may actually have to account for his personal behavior.



<p>
<li>

Our friend Bill Kristol, after talking up Newt Gingrich and Colin Powell as presidential candidates, has recently been seen dallying with Lamar Alexander. With a record like that, if Bob Dole does get elected, Kristol will be forced to move to Bermuda come January 1997. On the other hand, if Dole caves in to Clinton on the budget again, Mr. Kristol will quickly be joined by members of the late Republican majority in Congress.


<p>
<li>


When Bob Dole and Newt Gingrich created the Kemp Commission on tax reform, it was widely viewed as a stalking horse for a Dole tax plan. In the end, however, the commission shied away from devising a detailed plan of its own, preferring to outline general principles for tax reform with which all the advocates of competing flat-tax and sales-tax plans could agree. The most important of these was that the ``progressive'' structure of multiple rates be scrapped in favor of a single low rate. The task for Republicans now is not to design an ideal tax system from scratch, but to improve the tax system in a politically achievable way. (The commission has already suggested that the charitable deduction and mortgage-interest deduction may have to stay.) We would urge that long-term political consequences also be kept in mind. Tax reform should not raise taxes on any large class of taxpayers; so tax reform must incorporate a major tax cut. Reform should not make taxes less visible and thus easier to raise -- a substantial defect of some current proposals. And conservatives should be leery of taking millions of Americans off the income-tax rolls, as both the Armey and Forbes plans do, lest citizens come to believe that they can enjoy Big Government for free.


<p>
<li>


The new 1040s have been mailed, yet there are still 97,000 people who haven't received a refund check for last year's IRS overcharges.

<p>
<li>



Some time ago, North Miami passed a law, upheld by a Florida state court, disallowing applications for city jobs  from anyone who had smoked in the past year. A 52-year-old typist, Arlene Kurtz, challenged the ruling, but the Supreme Court has now declared that it was rational for North Miami to discriminate against her, because smokers get sick more often than non-smokers. Logically, this clears the way for all kinds of ``rational'' discrimination: against gays, because they suffer disproportionately from AIDS; against skiers, because they break their legs more often than non-skiers; against lovers of junk food, because a healthier diet would make them less vulnerable to heart disease; and so on. Of course, the New Class has no ideological interest in attacking skiers and it takes a decidedly protective interest in gays. Smokers, on the other hand, and everyone else who enjoys bodily pleasures deemed medically inadvisable, are very much in the sights of our betters. It's time for Congress to step in. They live pretty carelessly, and what's bad enough for them should be bad enough for the rest of us.


<p>
<li>


CNN Crossfire co-host Bob Beckel angrily declared that, because of the shutdown, his mother was not going to receive her meals on wheels. Suddenly the devastating effects of the shutdown came home to us. A food basket is on its way to Mrs. Beckel as a token of NR's atonement.


<p>

Sam Zhadanov, a 60-year-old inventor and engineer, is serving a five-year sentence in federal prison for making little plastic bottles. His customers told him the containers were for perfume samples. The government said they were crack vials. Feeling he had done nothing wrong, Zhadanov originally insisted on a trial. But under pressure from prosecutors, who threatened to arrest his wife, and on the advice of his attorney, he pleaded guilty. In addition to the prison sentence, Zhadanov has lost almost all of his property to forfeiture. He had never been in trouble with the law before. Yet he was punished more severely than anyone else in the case, including the distributors who hired him to make the bottles and the retailers who sold them to the ultimate users. Although the government said the retail buyers were crack dealers, none of them were arrested, and none of the defendants ever saw any drugs, let alone sold them. Furthermore, in a 1992 case involving crack vials, the courts found that containers did not fall within the federal definition of drug paraphernalia. Zhadanov, who has been in Allenwood Federal Prison Camp for a year, plans a hunger strike on January 18 to call attention to the abuses committed in the name of the war on drugs. ``For much of my life I endured the oppression of the former Soviet Union. Now I am reliving that experience in my new home, where I came in search of justice and liberty.''


<p>

Chap in Fort Worth walked into a bank next door to a police station, waited patiently in line wearing a ski mask, ordered the teller to fill a bag with money, politely told her to have a nice day, walked out, and was arrested instantly. Evidently another great mind produced by the public-school system.

<p>
<li>



The great environmental scare of the 1980s was acid rain threatening forests with epidemics of dieback. The Environmental Protection Agency and the Canadian forestry agency looked into the causes of forest dieback, and the results are just coming in. Records of the health of maple and birch forests going back a hundred years show no evidence of increased dieback: ``in fact the successive peak levels [of dieback] decreased slightly over the three most recent episodes.'' The research cites no role for acid rain, and explains episodes of dieback as owing to ``overmaturity'' (scientific jargon, we assume, for ``old age'') and late frosts, which can weaken trees. We expect the EPA to say that the electric companies can scrap all those expensive electrostatic precipitators they were forced to install on their smokestacks to reduce sulphur-dioxide emissions. And to announce that electric bills will drop 20 per cent.

No one has commented yet, but there are 18 1/2 footnotes missing from the published screenplay of Oliver Stone's Nixon.

REAGANOMICS LITE
<p>
Rich and Spoiler
<p>
Steve Forbes's optimistic message
is resonating with voters. But does
Forbes really have a chance?
<p>
RICH LOWRY
<p>
Mr. Lowry is NR's national political reporter.
<p>


<p>STEVE Forbes's campaign manager, Bill Dal Col, volunteers an answer to a question a reporter asks of his candidate: What has Forbes learned about campaigning since launching his long-shot presidential bid? ``That at least you're pretty good at it,'' says Dal Col, smiling, glancing admiringly at his boss. Forbes, making a late-December campaign swing through Iowa, is tucked into the back of a chartered jet in awkward proximity with two reporters and two members of his campaign staff, trying to steal glances at the day's Wall Street Journal. He laughs at the boastful comment with an almost boyish embarrassment, then gestures Dal Col's way with a typically laconic rejoinder: ``Spinmeister, here.''
<p>If the cliche of 1990s politics is that ``anything can happen,'' this is anything: a diffident multi-millionaire magazine publisher with no elective experience, no knack for small-talk or back-slapping, seemingly no traditional political skills at all, rocking the race for the Republican presidential nomination. Thanks to a TV advertising blitz that has already cost an estimated $12 million and made him a minor celebrity among blue-haired old ladies in places like Sioux City, Iowa, Forbes is running second in polls in Iowa and New Hampshire and is first, according to one recent survey, in Arizona. He may be the candidate of the ``air war,'' but Forbes threatens to cause major disruption on the ground -- for the candidates still looking to get a clean shot at Bob Dole, and even for the front-runner himself.
<p>The Forbes campaign is 1980s supply-side faith given a 1990s torque. Its roots are in the collapse of the supply-side message within a GOP that has made Ross Perot's obsession with the deficit its own; in the slow political deterioration of supply-side champion Jack Kemp, who has failed to stay at the cutting edge of the party; and in the search of supply-side guru Jude Wanniski, among others, for a presidential candidate to fill the resulting message and leadership vacuums. But the campaign also owes a debt to Perot populism -- in its anti-Washington, pro-term-limit rhetoric -- and, oddly enough, to the hard-ball political tactics of Sen. Jesse Helms. So, at the same time Forbes runs on Reagan optimism, he flirts with an opportunistic, ``outsider'' populism at odds with the idea-driven rationale for his candidacy.
<p>Steve Forbes, of course, enjoys a head-start in name ID. His grandfather, B. C. Forbes, began Forbes magazine in 1917 as a feisty chronicle of the ``doers and doings'' of American business. When his son Malcolm took over in 1964, he embarked on a frenetic campaign of promotion of the magazine -- as a ``capitalist tool'' -- and of himself that swelled the magazine's circulation and profit margins. By the 1970s, Malcolm was the world-conquering capitalist, famous for his collection of Faberge eggs, his motorcycling, and extravagant parties. Steve joined the magazine shortly after graduation from Princeton. He started as a reporter, worked his way up through the ranks and already had a large hand in running Forbes by the time of his father's death in 1990. 
<p>Steve's first full-contact political experience was as chairman of the Board of International Broadcasting, which oversaw Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty, in the Reagan and Bush Administrations. By all accounts he was an able BIB chairman, engaged on the substantive questions before him and tenacious in protecting the interests of the ``radios'' on Capitol Hill. In 1993, along with then - Wall Street economist Larry Kudlow, Forbes developed the 30 per cent, across-the-board tax cut proposal that became the centerpiece of his friend Christy Todd Whitman's successful New Jersey gubernatorial campaign. Around the same time, Forbes became chairman of the board of the listless Jack Kemp/Bill Bennett organization, Empower America.
<p>Part of Empower's trouble was that it was perceived as a mere holding pen for Kemp until he ran in 1996. As 1995 progressed, it became clear that Kemp  wouldn't be running, and supply-siders began looking for another horse to back. Jude Wanniski, the brilliant if eccentric supply-side guru, had been engaged in an unlikely dalliance with Bob Dole that he abruptly cut off in early March. Within days he was faxing Forbes (one of a number of Wanniski's unlikely presidential possibilities, including first-term Utah Senator Bob Bennett) a several-thousand-word memo on why he should run. ``Several hours later,'' recalls Wanniski, ``the phone rang and it was Steve. And he said, 'Wow, this memo knocked me out.''' Forbes would soon decide that there was a growth, supply-side vacuum in the race, and that he was the man to fill it.
<p>
<p>The shy Forbes appears the unlikeliest of politicians. At a late-December meet-and-greet at a restaurant in Council Bluffs, Iowa, Forbes stood away from the doors, his hands awkwardly at his sides, as dozens of locals filed in for a chicken sandwich and stump speech. With those voters who ventured over to him he shook hands in his distinctive style -- arm out stiffly, head bowed as if he's looking at his interlocutor's Adam's apple. Standing three feet from him its impossible to hear Forbes's words, he's so soft-spoken, except for the occasional, ``Oh, goodness!'' But he laughs often, tucking in his chin like a Citadel cadet, grinning wide with all his teeth. With his thick eyeglasses and soft manner, the impression is of Clark Kent, pulled from his desk at the Daily Planet, forced to do public relations.
<p>The Forbes stump speech can be just as awkward. He delivers it from memory, but in the same halting cadences as if it were being read. Despite it all, Forbes elicits warm reactions from crowds, who not only like his themes but take a shine to his naked genuineness. The speech has almost no applause lines except his prescription for the current tax code: ``Scrap it, kill it, drive a stake through its heart, bury it, and hope it never rises again.'' But at a restaurant in Sioux City, jammed with two hundred Iowans one recent Friday night, people clapped almost every time Forbes stopped to take a breath, even after he called for a radical overhaul of Social Security.
<p>The key to the Forbes campaign is that it has a split personality; the good-willed awkwardness of Forbes the person is combined with the relentless ferocity of Forbes the campaign ad. Free from the state-by-state spending restraints that limit other candidates, Forbes has blanketed Iowa, Arizona, and New Hampshire with his spots. Some are biographical, others pegged to the flat tax, still others ruthlessly critical of his opponents, especially Bob Dole. One attacked Dole for delaying a term-limits vote in the Senate, neglecting to mention that Dole did so at the behest of term-limits supporters. A shameless cheap shot. The latest are cut from the same cloth, hitting Dole for supporting the construction of the Senate subway and funding for an Idaho ski project -- minutiae pulled from larger bills with no particular connection to Dole.
<p>The ads are almost certainly the fruit of Forbes's early decision to make a battle-tested group of North Carolina operatives, instead of Jude Wanniski, central to his campaign. Explains one insider: ``Jude basically tried to bring in John Sears to resurrect the old Reagan campaign of '79 and early '80, this time with Jude as the Svengali of policy. And Forbes wouldn't have any of it -- thankfully.'' Forbes turned instead to the tag team that ran Jesse Helms's campaigns until a bitter recent split with the senator, Carter Wrenn (who is on the Forbes payroll) and Tom Ellis (who is an informal ``kibitzer''). The hallmark of the two are media-intense, hard-hitting, through-the-roof-expensive campaigns.  In the deep-pocketed Forbes, says one North Carolina insider, ``they got the dream candidate.''
<p>The chief issue they will help Forbes sell is, of course, the flat tax. Under his plan, personal exemptions would keep a family of four that makes up to $36,000 a year from paying any taxes at all. All income after that would be taxed at a 17 per cent rate. There would be no deductions and no tax on interest, dividends, or capital gains -- just on labor income. The benefits from rationalizing the system, reducing marginal rates, and eliminating the double taxation of savings and investment would be considerable. And, sure enough, part of the Forbes sales pitch is pure Jack Kemp optimism, a paean to economic forces unleashed. But Forbes also talks, like Pat Buchanan, of families sweating it out on the ``treadmill.'' And there are whiffs of another flat-taxer, maverick Democrat Jerry Brown, in his attacks on the current code as ``the principal source of political corruption in Washington.''
<p>It makes for a potent mix. But, upon closer examination, the politics get trickier. The dirty secret of the flat tax is that it threatens to raise taxes on the middle class, drop lower-income people off the rolls, lower the tax burden on upper-income taxpayers, and exclude capital income, disproportionately enjoyed by the rich, from taxation entirely and someone, i.e., the middle class, will have to pick up the slack (and give up their home-mortgage deductions to boot). It's a deadly political shortcoming. Forbes tries to avoid it by promising a flat tax that is a tax cut. His 17 per cent rate would, by his campaign's estimate, lose $40 billion its first year (by some estimates it would lose as much $200 billion). Forbes dismisses these figures because he argues that lower tax rates will lead to greater growth and, hence, more revenues.
<p>But again politics intrude. After a grueling year-long fight, are Republicans really ready to say all their Congressional Budget Office economic assumptions are irrelevant and the ``glide-path'' to the balanced budget of secondary importance? Perhaps they should be. But the deficit has become a crucial political proxy for shrinking the size of government. Without it, making the case for getting ``savings'' from entitlement programs like Medicare or paring back discretionary spending becomes that much more difficult. Forbes gives no indication of having the stomach for the fight. On the stump he offers up one specific agency for total elimination: the Federal Communications Commission. Forbes exudes the naive 1980s supply-side faith that it's not the size of government per se but marginal tax rates that pose the biggest threat to the economy and to the culture. 
<p>Indeed, for Forbes the flat tax is more than an economic elixir. It stands in for most of the rest of his policy. ``Contrary to what some people would have you believe,'' he says on the stump, ``in America there really is no difference between values and economics. They are one and the same.'' Forbes then evokes thrift, hard work, trust, etc. -- and within limits he has a point. But it's not always clear he knows the limits. In his announcement speech Forbes promised that the flat tax and his other economic idee fixe, the gold standard, would lead to ``a renaissance the like of which has never been seen before. Families would step off the tax treadmill; wage earners could relax a little, save more easily; parents would have more time to spend with their children and each other; they would have more time to devote to where it belongs -- to the home and hearth, where all true value lies.''
<p>For this vision, ``optimistic'' is not the word. It is tinged with a kind of economic determinism and a faith in human nature that offends against the deepest wellsprings of traditional conservatism. In the world of Steve Forbes, entrepreneurs busily advance their ambitions in a kind of perfect social harmony, responding to the positive incentives of a free economy. Harold Johnson of the Orange County Register refers to it as ``possibility thinking,'' the sunniness popularized by Californians like Kemp and supply-side pioneer Arthur Laffer. Traditionally conservatism takes a darker view of the human potential for vice and folly, and prescribes a certain amount of negative incentive, whether through social ostracism or the force of law, to keep it in check. It is this element that is missing from the Forbes world-view and is reflected, on the concrete level, in his unease with parts of the Republican social agenda.
<p>Take abortion. On Roe v. Wade -- bad law, whatever you think of abortion -- Forbes takes the essentially pro-choice dodge that it can't be overturned absent a shift in public opinion. Pro-lifers in his camp hold out hope of moving him rightward on the issue; he recently denounced partial-birth abortion in his ``Fact and Comment'' column in Forbes  and characterizes his position as ``not pro-choice.'' But as of now his position limits his appeal among the social-conservative base of the GOP necessary for any serious challenge to Dole.
<p>The other social issues present a similar problem. The social agenda provides the ``wedge issues'' -- crime, welfare,  immigration -- that allow conservative candidates to appeal to Reagan Democrats. Forbes clearly isn't comfortable talking about them. On immigration, he parts ways with an employee, Forbes senior editor and immigration restrictionist Peter Brimelow. ``I prefer Julian Simon on that issue,'' says Forbes. He has warned of the more hard-edged GOP welfare proposals that ``The American people will not tolerate cutting off benefits for children.'' Forbes tries to make up for his soft social edge with anti-Washington rhetoric; instead of talking about welfare, he runs ads on the Senate subway.
<p>And he has had some success with this tack. Rather than picking up the traditional pro-growth voters (wealthier, better educated), Forbes, according to New Hampshire surveys by the Polling Company, is making inroads among men making less than $40,000 a year and independent voters. The populist appeal of the flat tax and his anti-Washington rhetoric, as well as his indisputable status as an ``outsider,'' account for this seeming anomaly. Meanwhile, in lower taxes and economic growth, Forbes has picked up on an appealing theme inexplicably dropped by the other candidates. All this combined with piles of money -- at least $25 million -- makes the campaign's strategy plausible, if not likely. The idea is to finish respectably in Iowa and New Hampshire, then become a real contender by knocking Dole off somewhere else, perhaps the early primary state of Arizona, where Forbes is spending a mint.
<p>An alternative scenario is not so happy. Forbes is vulnerable to just the sort of cheap populist attacks he himself has been launching. (If the Forbes campaign thinks the Senate subway makes a good image for extravagance, it should just wait till some opponent latches onto the Highlander or Capitalist Tool.) Some of Forbes's advantage dissipates as soon as it becomes clear that the other candidates have already endorsed the principles (if not every politically unpalatable detail) of the flat tax. And Forbes's late jump in organizing will inevitably hurt when it comes time to turn out actual voters, especially in the Iowa caucuses.
<p>All these obstacles suggest that the upper limit for Forbes may be the role of spoiler. He splits the conservative vote three ways with Gramm and Buchanan, and blocks Alexander's emergence as an ``outsider'' alternative to Dole, while perhaps never quite becoming viable himself. Jude Wanniski, always the supply-side optimist, once wrote that ``Insofar elections are honestly conducted, they always turn out right.'' His candidate is about to sorely test the theory.

<p>
I understand that you're angry. You have every reason to be. You know and I know that your work down in the Amazonian rainforest is important.
<p>But you have to understand that while I certainly don't consider you ``non-essential,'' the Federal Government does. And, if I may say so, you've got it pretty easy down there; the furloughed non-essential federal employees who live up here can't pay for their groceries with a carton of cigarettes and a Penthouse
magazine.
<p>I'm trying to be sympathetic here, but, as my dad would say, ``Put a little gratitude in that attitude.'' Be thankful that when I re-invented government, I didn't re-invent it so much that we got rid of 350,000 ``non-essential''
personnel.
<p>And, it isn't our fault that those people aren't working. It's the Republicans who keep erecting roadblocks. I mean, we've agreed to balance the budget in seven years.
And we've agreed to cut Medicare. And we've agreed to a per-child rebate. But they keep pushing for a balanced budget in seven years, and Medicare cuts, and a per-child rebate. And so the impasse continues.
<p>And in the third place -- and this is strictly between us -- I mean, let's be honest: most of those federal employees make an average annual salary of $41,500, which by OMB standards, puts them squarely in the category of the ``super mega rich,'' and so in many ways, I say to them what my dad said to me when I complained about the food in Eliot House: ``Cry me a river.''
<p>And in the fourth place, the ``super mega rich'' are all that the Republicans care about, giving them huge tax cuts and corporate handouts. So the ``super mega rich'' and ``non-essential'' federal employees should blame the Republicans for this gridlock, not us, because we care about them, and the Republicans only care about . . .
<p>Wait a sec. I'm getting lost here. Let me check my notes.
<p>Okay. Got it. Back on trac.
<p>Dick Morris has provided all of us with a laminated three-by-five card -- just like Reagan used -- that keeps a lot of these issues straight. Tipper quizzes me on it while driving me to the Brinkley show. It's a pretty clear card:
<p>We're totally against the Republican tax cuts for the rich. But that doesn't mean that we don't think that we raised taxes too much on the rich. It just means that we're totally against the Republican tax cuts for the rich.
<p>And we are absolutely not going to cut welfare. But we are going to end it as we know it. But we are not going to cut it.
<p>And we are going to balance the budget in seven years. But a balanced budget isn't that important. And anyway, we've already balanced it.
<p>Any question?
<p>The only thing that concerns me is that I'm not sure this message will carry us through November. I keep pushing for a ``They'll warm the globe; we'll warm your heart'' type of slogan, but Dick is pretty adamant that we stay ``on message.''
<p>``Dick,'' I asked him the other day, ``are you at all concerned that running against Congress might backfire? Sure, we're ahead in the polls now, but so was Jimmy Carter at this point in 1976 -- and, for that matter, George Bush in 1992. But at some point, we're going to have a budget deal, and people are going to forget about the impasse.''
<p>``That's an awkward question, Mr. Vice President. The short answer to your question is, 'Hey, I've got you guys to about 54% approval, Bob Dole is most probably going to be your opponent -- I mean, what more do you want?' The longer answer to your question is, 'Yes, you've made some interesting points, and I'm sure that when he takes over, Jim Carville will fine-tune the message to a more, shall we say, left-wing frequency.' Rest assured, though, I will never be more than a phone call away.''
<p>For some reason, Rusty, that didn't reassure me. 
<p>I spent a few minutes collecting my thoughts. Then I popped into the Cabinet Room. Bill, Bob Dole, Newt Gingrich, and an assortment of others were embroiled in negotiations. Bill had just conceded a capital-gains tax cut.
<p>``Am I hearing you right, Mr. President?'' Speaker Gingrich asked. ``You're now in favor of a capital-gains tax cut?''
<p>``Absolutely,'' Bill said.
<p>``Well, this is good news,'' Gingrich added
<p>.Bill smiled. ``Just as long as it doesn't involve a capital-gains tax cut.''
<p>``Um . . . '' Gingrich said
<p>.Bill folded up his laminated card, looked up and caught my eye, and gave me a big ``thumbs up.''
<p>Here's hoping you get back to your non-essential work soon, Rusty.

<h2>On the Right</h2>

<P>


 Wm. F. Buckley Jr.
<p>
Who Is to Blame?
<p>
NEW YORK, DECEMBER 19
<p>
<p>On the program 60 Minutes, a half-dozen retiring legislators submitted to friendly interrogation inquiring into the reason for their decision to give it all up, go home. Most of their complaints we are familiar with. Unquestionably the most searing is the business about money: Senator Alan Simpson reported that a senator has to raise a minimum of $10,000 every week, which is a heavy load. When you consider 10 thou times 52 times 6 that adds up to over $3 million -- which is only one-third of what retiring Senator Paul Simon had to spend to get back into the Senate. 
<p>Is that situation inherently corrupt? Not a bad question. One senator put it this way. He gets back to his hotel at 10 P.M. after a hard day of electioneering and he has twenty telephone messages, all of them from strangers. But one name he does recognize, because that goodbody had donated $1,000 to the senator's campaign. The senator has the energy left, at that time of night -- after such a day -- to make one phone call, so whom does he call? Right. And even if it happened that the caller's message was, Please vote in favor of Measure X, and the senator goes out and votes against Measure X, it still remains that the only person who got through to him was a Measure X enthusiast, and enthusiasms have a way of communicating themselves, not least when fueled with thousand-dollar bills. Is there a way to stop all that? No, not under our system. It could be changed only by going to a parliamentary system on the British model.
<p>But a less conventional complaint of some of the retiring gentlemen had to do with the under-celebrated art of compromise. People just don't understand, one man put it, that politics is -- you guessed it, the art of compromise. The gentlemen being interviewed were too polite to say it in exactly as many words, but what they were criticizing was the Gingrich House. To use bald figures, one had the impression that if Gingrich would simply give up on tax reform, he'd get substantially what he wanted in the way of tax reform. 
<p>And of course compromise is the civilized approach to most controversies, but the operative word in that sentence is ``most.'' And the entrenched mood of the congressmen who do not wish to compromise with Mr. Clinton is reinforced by the rhetoric used by Mr. Clinton and his satellites. It could be that your call to reduce medical expenses by $270 billion in seven years could be adulterated a little, say to $250 billion in eight years, that kind of thing -- do it, take a deep breath, and sigh resignedly over the rough nature of democratic compromise. 
<p>But to engender receptivity for the compromise mode requires rhetorical adaptation at the other end, and this President Clinton is ostentatiously declining to do. He speaks instead of Republicans wishing to cut medical services for the aged and the indigent, using words appropriate to a situation in which Congress was planning to sequester a million people every year in a huge federal compound and let them die there of starvation and exposure. Slowly. 
<p>Even the most dogged defenders of state welfarism here and there break under the strain. The New Republic's editorialist, remarking on the success Mr. Clinton is having with his phony scare tactics, lays the final blame on the voting public. ``The only people being fundamentally irresponsible in the recent -- and continuing -- budget battle are the American people. They are, to borrow a phrase from our colleague Michael Kinsley, big babies. A year ago, in a realigning election, voters ushered in a Republican Congress that had pledged, in complete candor, to balance the federal budget. In the days before that election, voters backed Republicans over Democrats by a 2.8 per cent margin. Then the Republicans made a fatal error: they tried to deliver on their promise. The result is that in the last few months, the party positions have been completely reversed. The Democrats now lead by 2.4 per cent.'' 
<p>But then whom do you blame for the people's immaturity? The editorialist suggests it is the people themselves who are to blame, for wanting one thing and authorizing another. ``Speaker Gingrich, for all his failings, is the first American politician actually to confront the public with the reality. For that, he gets an approval rating of 27 per cent.'' Any effort to bail out the American people for this act of irresponsibility would have to reason to the people's ignorance for believing what their President has been telling them, six times a day, for the past six weeks. If the voters believe Clinton is correct -- that passage of the Contract with America will result in agony and death for uncounted hundreds of thousands of Americans -- then they are right to say no to Mr. Gingrich. 
<p>And the problem becomes: What to do about demagogues in the White House? Vote them out of office? Yes, but what will inform the voters that that is the thing to do?

Jack Kemp explains that liberal Congressman Tom Campbell (R., Calif.) represents ``what Colin Powell calls the Lincoln wing of the Republican Party.'' Make that the Lincoln Continental wing, Jack.
<p>

Yes, the House Ethics Committee essentially cleared Newt Gingrich on all but one of the sixty counts of ethics complaints against him. It's also true that the one outstanding question -- whether tax-exempt foundations violated their tax status by donating to his college course -- involves an eye-glazing technicality. But Republicans are fooling themselves if they think any of this matters. The Speaker suffered a grievous blow when the Ethics Committee agreed to appoint an outside counsel to investigate that last count. Ethics Committee Chairman Nancy Johnson (R., Conn.) apparently didn't realize it, but any other result would have been preferable. In an outside counsel, Democrats get what they've always wanted, a gung-ho investigator who will push to expand his inquiry until he finds the one violation that provides the leverage for forcing Gingrich from office. In this overtly political fight, Republicans must start punching back. First, they should insist that the outside counsel be a tax lawyer rather than a prosecutor willing to become a Grand Inquisitor. Next, the GOP needs to defend the Speaker more generally. Republicans were encouraged when the exquisitely moderate Tom Campbell trounced an anti-Newt candidate in a December 12 special election. But GOP freshmen won't have Campbell's luxury of distancing themselves from the Speaker. Their reputations depend, at least partly, on resisting the Democrats' effort to decapitate the new majority through the sheer force of negative press and ethics smears. This time it's the counter-revolution that mans the guillotine. Republicans must blunt its blade.
<p>
<li>

After speaking non-stop for five hours at a news conference, Rep. Enid Waldholtz (R., Utah) faces a little-known federal charge: impersonating the President.
<p>
<li>

Rep. Ron Wyden won the Democratic nomination to run for Sen. Bob Packwood's seat in Oregon's special election, but the eight-term House veteran hasn't recovered from the humiliation of scoring 0 for 7 in a local TV station's pop quiz. Wyden couldn't find Bosnia on a globe; didn't know the price of a loaf of bread, a gallon of gas, or a gallon of milk; couldn't give the unemployment rate or largest employer in Oregon; and couldn't name Canada's prime minister. Mail-in balloting begins on January 10, and a recent poll has Republican State Sen. Gordon Smith (quiz score: 5 for 7) ahead by 5 points. Poor Wyden -- he was probably looking for Bosnia at the heart of Europe.
<p>

Move over, Engler and Weld; George Pataki has joined the club. In his latest budget New York's governor calls for a 25 per cent cut in welfare benefits, a six-month eligibility limit for able-bodied beneficiaries, and a reduction of $1 billion in the state's gold-plated Medicaid program. For the first time in over fifty years spending financed by state and local sources will decline -- if George Pataki has his way. To be sure, his program is unlikely to survive intact, and even if it did, would still leave New York with the highest per-capita state and local spending in the nation. The governor's conservatism is less an epiphany than atonement for mistakes made in his freshman year, when the largest tax cut in state history was offset by a wide array of gimmicks, most of which merely pushed costs into future years. Time may be on Pataki's side, however. After lagging the nation throughout the Cuomo years, New York State added 90,000 new jobs in the last year, catapulting from 50th to 4th in private-sector job creation. Replacing nanny with a job seems like a far more practical proposition today -- even in the nation's premier nanny state.

For all the attention the Western media have paid, the world-wide evangelical Protestant revolution, described in this issue by the distinguished sociologist David Martin, might not be happening at all. Yet as revolutions go, it seems likely to prove of at least equal significance to Islamic fundamentalism and more lasting than Marxism. Other Christians, especially Catholics, will be of two minds about its religious impact since its general tendency is to turn bad Catholics into good Protestants. Even so, its effect on the Roman Catholic and other mainline churches may be ultimately benign. As Professor Martin points out, it provides them with a sharp incentive to reform religious beliefs and practices that have become infected by either a tepid secularism or leftist politics. For the paradox of evangelical Christianity is that by stressing holiness and personal salvation above the ``social gospel,'' it turns this world upside down. It releases people from ancient forms of bondage, both practical and psychological, into hard work, self-reliance, responsibility, love of family, and equality before God. These virtues, preached pre-eminently by John Wesley, redeemed the British working class from the moral squalor of the early Industrial Revolution and, translated to politics, fueled the American Revolution (ruefully described by George III as a revolution of Presbyterians). On the wings of the English language, they are now spreading to every continent. The Western media will notice eventually -- watch for headlines like: ``The Religious Right Goes Global.''
<p>
<li>

David Rieff writes in The New Yorker that President Clinton ``has probably never before made a decision so fraught with political peril'' as to deploy troops in Bosnia. ``The stakes are enormous -- for the peace of Europe and, if American soldiers start coming home dead, for his own re-election hopes.'' For the soldiers too.

The great regulatory push to ban smoking in bars, airplanes, restaurants, and workplaces is based on studies that purport to show that non-smokers breathing in smokers' smoke are at risk. The most important study came from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which went so far as to claim that three thousand Americans were dying each year from exposure to secondhand tobacco smoke. The 1993 EPA report was subject to widespread criticism by statisticians and epidemiologists, and now the Congressional Research Service has called it junk science: ``the results are not definitive . . . even at the greatest exposure levels the measured risks are still subject to uncertainty . . . very few or even no deaths can be attributed to ETS (environmental tobacco smoke) . . .'' Senator Wendell Ford (D., Ky.) called on federal agencies to reconsider the blanket ban on smoking in public and semi-public places. Fat chance! The PC bureaucrats' rule is: Never let science get in the way of a good regulation.

Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary knows how to travel in style. On a week-long trip to South Africa, she flew in a luxury jet used by Madonna and brought along one hundred people. She has also taken expensive trips, courtesy of the taxpayers, to India, China, and Pakistan. Al Gore came to her defense: ``On these trips, she has created thousands of American jobs and billions of dollars in contracts for companies in this country.'' And that's just counting her entourage.

From the German magazine Der Spiegel: ``Gunther Burpus remained wedged in his front-door cat flap for two days because passersby thought he was a piece of installation art. Mr. Burpus, 41, of Bremen, was using the flap because he had mislaid his keys. Unfortunately, he was spotted by a group of student pranksters who removed his trousers, painted his bottom bright blue, stuck a daffodil between his buttocks, and erected a sign saying: 'Germany Resurgent. An Essay in Street Art. Please Give Generously.' Passersby assumed Mr. Burpus's screams were part of the act, and it was only when an old woman complained to the police that he was finally freed. 'I kept calling for help,' he said, 'but people just said, ``Very good, very clever!'' and threw coins at me.'''

<P>

Dear Rusty,
<p>

<p>Happy Holidays from all of us at the Gore home, and let me just say, right now, things are up in the air. We've got a budget showdown looming, to be honest, and it looks like it's going to be another eye-to-eye staring contest. We were strategizing just this afternoon in the Oval Office. 
<p>``What's our strategy?'' I asked. 
<p>Dick Morris looked up from his pipe. Bill puffed away on his cigar. 
<p>``I'm not following you, Mr. Vice President,'' Dick said.
<p>``You see, Al,'' Bill chimed in, ``Dick thinks -- and I think, too, of course -- that while a budget is nice -- hey, more than nice, a budget is pretty darn useful in many ways -- it's not the be-all-and-end-all.''
<p>``I'm a little confused,'' I said.
<p>``What Dick is saying -- and I agree with him, by the way -- is that sometimes a budget is really good and really helpful by not being written. By not being settled. Do you get me?''
<p>``What the President is saying,'' Dick interjected, puffing on his pipe, ``is that a dog that doesn't bark sometimes saves the house from being robbed.'' 
<p>``So I shouldn't call my friends in the Senate and work the back channels to make a deal?''
<p>``Weeeeelllllll,'' Dick said, ``if you put a gun to my head, I'd say no.''
<p>Bill gazed at me through the thickening smoke. ``You see, Al,'' he said, ``there are deficits and there are deficits. There's the $250-billion budget deficit -- and hoo, boy, that's a big one, no one's saying it isn't -- but there's also a little thing called a 'people deficit'.''
<p>``A 'people deficit'?'' I asked.
<p>``As in, how many people we need to approve of what we're doing versus how many people actually approve of what we're doing,'' Dick said.
<p>``Oh,'' I murmured. 
<p>``And you've got to admit, Al,'' Bill said, tapping the latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll, ``that Dick's starting to get at least one of these deficits under control.'' 
<p>I had to admit that, Rusty. As much as I like to think that I'm governed by pure motives, once or twice I've allowed myself to think about the coming campaign -- not '96, you understand, but '00, and '04. And when I hear talk like that from Bill and Dick Morris, well, I get a little concerned. Gore '00 and Gore '04 are going to be a lot easier -- and a lot more fun -- if we can lick this budget thing right now. 
<p>So I left the meeting a little early, just as Bill wasn't returning a phone call from John Kasich. The minute I sat down behind my desk, the phone rang. It was Dad, calling from Carthage, Tennessee. 
<p>``Hi, Dad,'' I said. ``How's the weather down there?'' 
<p>``Cold, I think. Though I'm getting warmer,'' he said, shaking his highball glass next to the receiver. ``Well, all this talk about Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security has got your mother and me a little worried.''
<p>``Worried?''
<p>``You folks up there aren't planning to hang us older folks out to dry, are you?''
<p>``Of course not, Dad,'' I said, with as much emphasis as I could. 
<p>``Glad to hear it. Some of the neighbors are starting to talk -- there's a rumor around town that Medicare premiums are going to go up almost $14 in the next few years.'' 
<p>``Well, they might, Dad. You see, the system is very expensive -- '' 
<p>He interrupted me. ``I know it's expensive, son. You forget: I voted it in! I was in the Senate at the time, Mr. Smartypants, while you were in Harvard Yard, experimenting with prose forms. And we didn't vote the damn thing in so's you guys could cut it off. We voted it in for us! So let us have it!''
<p>``Dad?''
<p>``You know, you've got your Great Aunt Catherine scared to death. She thinks that you guys in Washington are going to take her Medicare and her Social Security away and leave her penniless and begging in the streets.'' 
<p>I tried to soothe him. ``Okay, Dad, I'll call her this afternoon and explain things to her.'' 
<p>``It'll have to be next month,'' Dad replied. ``She's on a Mediterranean cruise until February.'' 
<p>He hung up on me. I was too keyed up to work, so I headed back to the Oval Office. But by the time I got there, it was such a smoke-filled room that I could barely recognize Bill and Dick. 
<p>My secretary just buzzed me -- John Kasich is on line one. Excuse me while I don't take this. 
<p>Happy Holidays, Rusty!

<p>When Members of Congress finally head home for the holidays they will have ended the busiest legislative session in the last 14 years; both houses convened during 1995 for three months more than last year. How is the show being received? Well, even without thunderous applause for the Act I Contract with America, and despite the intermission in Act II's balanced-budget act, the House Republican leadership is already scripting an encore for its exhausted troupe.
<p>Much depends on whether a deal is reached with President Clinton on the budget. If so, veteran Members and the freshman ingenues alike believe they can look forward to a more measured pace of activity next year. Congressional Republicans will be focusing on implementing the budget provisions. But 1996 being a presidential election year, they will also be timing their debates and floor votes on new issues to cause maximum discomfort for candidate Clinton. Without a budget deal, however, the arguments over Medicare, tax cuts, welfare reform, and Medicaid will remain at the center of congressional politics -- and of the presidential race. Deal or no deal, next year promises to be every bit as contentious as this year has been.
<p>But there will be no second Contract with America. As one leadership aide explains, ``It was easier last year to draw up the Contract because many Members had little interest in it.'' He points out that a second version of the Contract could never accommodate the specific interests of enough Members to win consensus support. Still, Republicans recognize the success of last year's common message and the importance of the ``promises kept'' strategy. So they plan to unveil a joint legislative agenda for their presidential nominee and congressional candidates to run on following their convention in August.
<p>San Diego is nine months away, however. What will the GOP talk about in the meantime? Senator Dole won't be sitting down with his committee chairmen until January to lay out a legislative agenda that promotes issues he views as helpful to his presidential campaign. But the House leadership has sketched out an agenda: on immigration reform, eliminating race and gender preferences, campaign-finance restrictions, an empowerment/community-renewal program for the cities, parental-rights legislation, and banking reform. As well as this fresh agenda, some old issues will be back to cause dissension in the ranks. There will be funding disputes over abortion and Title X, and House conservatives are determined (again!) to see large spending cuts imposed on the National Endowment for the Arts and Legal Services Corporation.
<p>New and old issues alike will provoke tough fights within the Republican caucus. One Hill staffer predicts that Newt Gingrich will regret not having the discipline of this year's Contract to enforce consensus. ``The Contract provided momentum that kept the caucus together, but next year Members will be looking at their individual races and the issues they care about,'' he explains. Still, GOP strategists hope that if these issues provoke some fratricide among Republicans, they can also be framed to threaten regicide at the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue.
<p>``This stuff scares Clinton to death,'' declares a House Judiciary Committee staffer about the bill introduced by Rep. Charles Canady (R., Fla.) to eliminate federal race and gender preferences. As proof he points to the Administration's refusal to disclose the results of its review of preference and set-aside programs undertaken following the Supreme Court's Adarand decision holding that such programs are subject to strict scrutiny. Scared or not, however, Mr. Clinton has to fight on this issue; his liberal base will insist. He is therefore expected to begin by laying down a smokescreen of disinformation, claiming (falsely) that he too opposes quotas, and that the Republican bill weakens existing anti-discrimination laws. A donnybrook is likely. But the leadership is committed to the Canady bill and its supporters are confident they can win -- if their colleagues have the stomach for the fight.
<p>Some have ulcers. More timid Republicans, fearful that the race card will be played against them, want the new empowerment/community-renewal package (sponsored by Oklahoma's J. C. Watts and Missouri's Jim Talent) moved first. The Watts - Talent bill, designed with the help of community self-help groups, is expected to include tax and regulatory relief for inner cities, school-choice provisions, and housing reforms. Watts and Talent promote the bill on its merits, recoiling from any connection with the debate over affirmative action. GOP moderates insist they need its cover to help them do the right thing.
<p>The Republican caucus remains divided over legal immigration -- with House Majority Leader Dick Armey strongly opposed to new restrictions. The President, on the other hand, gave an instant welcome to the Jordan Commission's proposals to cut legal immigration. Apparently, he feels Jimmy Carter lost him the Arkansas governorship in 1980 by admitting the Mariel's Cuban immigrants. He doesn't intend to lose himself the White House over immigrants -- and he has already invaded Haiti to prove it.
<p>
<p>That leaves campaign-finance reform, where the impetus comes from the freshman class. Party strategists are less gung-ho, fearing its provisions will damage GOP candidates and that even raising the issue will fuel public cynicism about Congress -- now run by the Republicans. Caring little for such calculations, the freshman class plans a retreat in January to determine next year's priorities. Institutional reforms and the elimination of Cabinet agencies will be top priorities, as will the parental-rights legislation sponsored by their fellow freshman, Steve Largent of Oklahoma.
<p>Many freshmen believe they were thwarted in their attempts to advance proposals this year. They will be less compliant next year. So, God rest ye merry, gentlemen, there'll be little respite in the new year. -- KATE O'BEIRNE
