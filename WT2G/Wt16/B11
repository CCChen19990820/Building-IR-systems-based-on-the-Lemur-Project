<center><h2>SUPREME COURT DOOMS<br>
EDUCATIONAL DIVERSITY</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The Supreme Court today struck down
the Virginia Military Institute's 157-year-old tradition of providing
single-sex education in <I>U.S. v. Commonwealth of Virginia</I>.
The Family Research Council had filed a friend of the court
brief in this case favoring single-sex public colleges.  FRC Senior
Policy Analyst Bob Maginnis noted that the decision &quot;limits
the diversity of education alternatives and obstructs a state's
traditional duty to provide education.&quot;

<p>

Maginnis said, &quot;Through eliminating publicly funded single-sex
education, the Supreme Court effectually instituted the Equal
Rights Amendment which failed to muster support from a majority
of the American people.  The ERA sought to equate gender with
race for discrimination laws despite the obvious differences between
men and women which do not exist among different races.  Nevertheless,
the Supreme Court by-passed the Constitution attempting to equate
race with gender by judicial fiat.&quot;

<p>

While this particular case appears to empower a woman's ability
to select the university of her choice, the shift in equal protection
jurisprudence may invalidate all 87 single-sex education facilities,
82 of which exist for females.  This shift precludes both men
and women from choosing to receive the benefits of single-sex
education.

<p>

Maginnis noted that &quot;research shows single-sex education
enables students to achieve higher educational performance and
encourages women to pursue majors such as science, math, and management.
Recognizing differences between the sexes and preparing educational
curriculum accordingly is rational; ignoring obvious differences
between the sexes in hopes they will disappear is nonsensical.&quot;

<p>

Although single-sex education may still exist in private schools,
the Supreme Court decision eliminates the possibility of single-sex
education for a large segment of the population who cannot afford
the cost of attending a private institution. Maginnis said that
&quot;the options available to individuals seeking an education
most appropriate for their specific needs is eliminated.&quot;

<center><h2><u>MISSION IMPOSSIBLE:</u><br>
REDEFINING MARRIAGE WITHOUT<br>
DESTROYING AMERICAN SOCIETY

<p>

HOW DO WE KNOW?<br>
ASK THE TOUGH QUESTIONS AT A MEDIA<br>
&amp; HILL STAFF BRIEFING ON JULY 2</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> In a special briefing for media and
Capitol Hill staffers, national leaders in the fields of law,
medicine, education and culture will outline the societal implications
of redefining marriage.

<p>

<b>Family Research Council President Gary L. Bauer will host
this historic briefing from 9:30 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. in the U.S.
Capitol, room HC-5, on July 2. Speakers list TBA.</b>

<p>

&quot;Marriage was not invented to oppress homosexuals,&quot;
Bauer noted. &quot;But most of the conversation on the Defense
of Marriage Act has centered around people's perceptions of the
homosexual experience, rather than on the consequences of  a tremendous
cultural change. The purpose of this event is to present intellectual
answers to the toughest questions. And to introduce national leaders
to the media on a revolutionary topic.

<p>

&quot;We have not begun to discuss, as a nation, the implications
of same sex 'marriage' on the law, our school, or our community.
We have barely acknowledged the many benefits of marriage between
a committed man and woman. We owe it to ourselves to understand
the possible outcomes of this unprecedented change.&quot;

<center><h2>GARY BAUER AND GRASSROOTS LEADERS ON<br>
THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT ...

<p>

HOW DOES AMERICA VIEW AN END TO<br>
MARRIAGE BETWEEN HUSBAND AND WIFE?</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> For a discussion of the grassroots
implications of redefining marriage, reporters, columnists and
editors should plan to attend a <B>9:30 A.M. MONDAY, JUNE 24</B>
news conference in the <B>MAIN LOUNGE</B> of the <B>NATIONAL PRESS
CLUB</B>. Family Research Council President Gary L. Bauer and
grassroots leaders will detail the need for the Defense of Marriage
Act along with the implications of destroying this pivotal union.

<p>

&quot;Nothing is as foundational for a culture as family. And
with poll after poll showing that American's number one concern
is family breakdown, this effort to cause the family death by
political correctness is even more out of place,&quot; said Bauer.

<p>

To discuss the grassroots reaction and strategy of DOMA, pro-family
leaders from the following states will attend: MICHIGAN, OHIO,
CALIFORNIA, ILLINOIS, KENTUCKY, MISSOURI, SOUTH DAKOTA, IDAHO,
MAINE and VIRGINIA.

<p>

Many of the men and women who will be represented have already
won battles to protect marriage. Others are in the legislative
process in the states, and all will be calling for Washington
to respect the right of citizens to set the laws for their individual
states.

<p>

The Defense of Marriage Act both defines marriage for the federal
codes and establishes the right of states to make laws governing
marriage for their citizens.

<center><h3>DEMOCRATIC LEADERS PREPARE TO RELEASE<br>
&quot;FAMILIES FIRST&quot; AGENDA SUNDAY...</h3>

<p>

<h2>BUT YOU CAN GET YOUR COPY TODAY</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b>What is a pro-family agenda? What would
America look like if family policy was more than just political
rhetoric? For answers to those questions, reporters and editors
do not have to wait for the Democratic event scheduled for Sunday.
Gary L. Bauer, president of the Family Research Council, has spent
more than 20 years answering those questions and has written a
concise book detailing what a pro-family America would look like.

<p>

For any reporter wondering how a prominent pro-family conservative
evaluates family issues, the book is a great reference and easy-to-use
guide. In fact, at the end of every chapter, yes-or-no questions
make it simple to analyze the kinds of policy initiatives making
daily news.

<p>

Already, Gary Bauer's book has sold more than 300,000 copies.
In fact, it is the number one best-selling paperback on the Christian
book sellers list.

<p>

Some people think it takes a village to figure out what's best
for children. For millions of Americans, parents decide one on
one every day.

<p>

<b>If you're looking for a pro-family American agenda, call Family
Research Council at 1-800-225-4008 or 202-393-2100.</b>

<center><h2>HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES HAVE WORSENED SINCE<br>
CHINA RECEIVED MFN STATUS</h2>

<p>

<h4>&quot;It's time to put teeth to our convictions<br>
and stop rewarding barbarity&quot; FRC says.</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;For 15 years, the United States
has extended 'most favored nation' trade status to China.  Originally,
it had been argued that an economic 'open door' might encourage
the Chinese government to shape up their human rights policies,
but in these past 15 years, we have only seen the barbarity and
cruelty of this communist regime increase,&quot; Family Research
Council Policy Analyst Gracie Hsu said Tuesday.

<p>

Hsu made her comments as Rep. Chris Smith's International Operations
and Human Rights subcommittee began its hearing on &quot;China
MFN:  Human Rights Consequences.&quot;  FRC urged Congress to
pass legislation revoking China's &quot;most favored nation&quot;
trade status because of China's continuing human rights abuses.
The House of Representatives is expected to take up legislation
regarding China's MFN status next week.

<p>

&quot;It was seven years ago when Chinese democracy-seekers were
ruthlessly gunned down at Tiananmen Square;&quot; Hsu continued,
&quot;it was only last year when Hong Kong newspapers reported
that aborted human fetuses were being cannibalized in China, sold
as health food. Last September, directly before the United
Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, the Chinese
government executed nine prisoners to 'send a message' to their
own people that they should not attempt to demonstrate against
the Chinese government.

<p>

&quot;In addition to these 'newer' human rights violations, other
abuses which existed in China prior to their receiving MFN status
continue to go unabated.  For example, the Chinese government
continues to exploit prisoners for slave labor in their gulag
system known as 'laogai,' as Harry Wu has demonstrated.  Furthermore,
Chinese women continue to be forcibly aborted or sterilized, state-run
orphanages continue to starve female children to death, and Christians
continue to be systematically tortured and imprisoned.

<p>

&quot;The failure of the United States to hold China accountable
for its heinous behavior has only encouraged the communist regime
to become more oppressive because it no longer fears that any
sanctions will be taken against it.  Year after year, the United
States has issued only empty threats against the Chinese government,
and in doing so, we have strained our credibility and undercut
our own stature as a moral leader in the world.  Instead, the
U.S. has sent the shameful message that, as a country, we care
more about succeeding economically than about championing universal
human rights.

<p>

&quot;It is time for the United States to put teeth to our convictions
and revoke China's 'most favored nation' trade privileges.&quot;

<center><h2>WHO CARES ABOUT MARRIAGE ...<br>
AND WHY OFFICIAL WASHINGTON<br>
SHOULD CARE</h2>

<p>

<h4>GRASSROOTS LEADERS TO STAND WITH FAMILY RESEARCH<br>
COUNCIL ON THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The grassroots implications of the
Defense of Marriage Act will be the topic of a <B>Monday, June
24, news conference</B> called by the Family Research Council
and Family Policy Councils from across the nation. The event will
take place in the <B>National Press Club Main Lounge at 9:30
a.m.</B>

<p>

&quot;One of the hottest issues in the public debate today is
same sex marriage. And there is every reason to believe that it
will be hotly debated by Bob Dole and Bill Clinton,&quot; said
Gary L. Bauer, Family Research Council president. &quot;FRC will
stand with state leaders who have already earned their stripes
on this issue at the local level in defense of marriage.&quot;

<p>

&quot;For anyone wondering whether the defense of home, family
and marriage is a winning issue, the grassroots victories and
support for the Defense of Marriage Act should make it clear.
Every major religion and every successful society has understood
the importance of marriage as the bringing together of the sexes.
And families across America also know just how important this
foundational institution is.&quot;

<p>

Many of the state leaders who will be in attendance have already
won battles in defense of marriage in their legislatures and will
be calling for the federal government to respect the views of
their state citizens. Others are in the middle of legislative
action on state marriage initiatives.

<p>

Family policy councils are state-based organizations that monitor
and advocate at the state level as FRC operates at the federal
level. Leaders from <b>Michigan, Ohio, California, Idaho and Missouri</b>
will be attending. Other state leaders, such as from <b>Pennsylvania,
Indiana, North Carolina and South Dakota,</b> will participate
either by statement or in person. Updated state information on
other participants will be available throughout the week.

<center><h2>SUPREME COURT EXTENDS<br>
JUDICIAL TYRANNY TO CITY LEVEL</h2>

<p>

<h4>&quot;Court has quit being a constitutional umpire</br>
and now bats clean-up for homosexual activism,&quot; Knight
says.</h4></center>

<p>

<b>Washington, D.C.--</b> In throwing out a lower court's ruling
that upheld Cincinnati's Issue 3 amendment to the city charter,
the U.S. Supreme Court went beyond its ill-reasoned decision last
month in <I>Romer v. Evans</I>, said Family Research Council Director
of  Cultural Studies Robert Knight on Monday.

<p>

In <I>Romer</I>,  the court had ruled that Colorado (or any state)
could not pass a law barring homosexuals from receiving special
civil rights protections at the state or local levels.  The law,
Colorado's Amendment Two, was designed to afford statewide protection
of speech, assembly and religion from coercive homosexual activism.

<p>

&quot;In today's Cincinnati case, the court says that voters can't
even amend their own city charters to preclude the enactment of
laws giving homosexuals more rights than other citizens,&quot;
Knight said. &quot;In remanding the case with instructions to
look at <I>Romer v. Evans</I>, the court is extending its illogic
to a new level.&quot;  As Justice Scalia said in today's dissent,
&quot;the consequence of holding this provision unconstitutional
would be that nowhere in the country may the people decide, in
democratic fashion, not to accord special protection to homosexuals.&quot;


<p>

&quot;As the sexual revolution keeps grinding, new litigants seeking
rights for pedophilia, polygamy and other sexual 'lifestyles'
will soon surface,&quot; Knight said. &quot;The people of Cincinnati
were right to try to keep 'sexual orientation' from being awarded
special protection.

<p>

&quot;The Supreme Court is stacking the deck against parents,
clergy, the Boy Scouts and businessmen who are being targeted
by coercive 'gay rights' laws.  In so doing, the court has quit
its role as constitutional umpire and is now batting clean-up
for the homosexual rights movement,&quot; Knight said. &quot;Let's
hope and pray that the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals won't be
cowed into creating more bad law.&quot;

<center><h2>ARROGANT DECISION CONTRADICTS PRIOR<br>
CASES ON PORNOGRAPHY DISTRIBUTION TO<br> 
MINORS, FRC SAYS</h2></center>

<p>

<center><h4>FRC Director of Legal Studies Cathy Cleaver says decision on
the Communications Decency Act not a pro-family defeat</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;What else should we expect from
an ACLU-hand-picked judge than a sweeping, radical decision allowing
adults to knowingly send and display pornography to minors on
the Internet?&quot; Director of Legal Studies Cathy Cleaver said
Wednesday. &quot;Nevertheless, this is not an ultimate defeat
for American families and children.  No matter where this case
goes next - either to the full Eastern District Court or the Supreme
Court - the Department of Justice will have a better opportunity
to defend the constitutionality of this statute.&quot;

<p>

Cleaver made her remarks as the Federal District Court for the
Eastern District of Pennsylvania released their decision Wednesday
on the <I>ACLU v. Reno</I> case involving the regulation of pornography
distribution to minors on the Internet.  Family Research Council
presented a &quot;friend of the court&quot; brief defending the
cyberporn provisions of the Communications Decency Act.  The decision,
written by Dolores K. Sloviter, Chief Judge of the 3rd Circuit
Court of Appeals and Carter appointee, contradicts previous Supreme
Court decisions on the distribution of indecent material through
the media.

<p>

&quot;It is an arrogant decision which flies in the face of the
Supreme Court and our society,&quot; Cleaver said.&quot; We have
long embraced the principle that those who peddle harmful material
have the obligation to keep the material from children. Outside
cyberspace, laws restrain people from displaying sexually explicit
images in public places and from selling porn magazines to children.
So, on the Internet, the burden of protecting children from exploitation
should not rest solely on the parents.&quot;

<p>

In her decision, Judge Sloviter maintains that it is &quot;either
technologically impossible or economically prohibitive&quot; for
pornographers to comply with the regulations. However, Cleaver
said that &quot;this decision reflects the Court's unwillingness
to consider proposed regulations by dismissing them as 'burdensome.'
There are constitutional ways to protect children from cyberporn
but not restrict the freedom of speech of the pornographers or
the adults.&quot;

<p>

Cleaver continued, &quot;Cyberspace is a work in progress. We
should not squander the opportunity to examine and appreciate
a world where pornography knows no bounds. Failure to enact strong
laws is a concession that the information superhighway should
belong to pornographers.  It would be like leaving a loaded gun
in a playground.&quot;

<center><h4><i>** MEDIA ADVISORY **</i></h4>

<p>

<h2>JUDICIARY COMMITTEE TO MARK UP<br>
DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE<br>
AND RELIGIOUS LIBERTY BILLS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The House Judiciary Committee begins
mark up today of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) (H.R. 3396)
and the Church Arson Prevention Act (H.R. 3525). 

<p>

Family Research Council President Gary Bauer said that &quot;Congress
and the President should do everything they can to extinguish
the fires that are causing the religious liberty of thousands
Americans to turn to nothing but embers.&quot; On the DOMA bill
Bauer added that &quot;the stability of this country rests on
our faith and our families. Without defending our nation against
the current threat of a redefinition of marriage, the traditional
family unit will never be the same.&quot; 

<p>

Both bills are on the fast track due to current events in Hawaii
and in the southern states.  As the date for the Hawaiian Supreme
Court case on &quot;gay marriage&quot; rapidly approaches, the
full House Judiciary Committee presses forward on DOMA today.
In the next few weeks, the Senate Judiciary Committee plans a
hearing at which Gary Bauer will testify on DOMA.

<p>

As the number of reported church fires in the southeast nears
60 since January 1995, the House Judiciary Committee begins mark
up of the Church Arson Prevention Act.  Co-sponsored by Chairman
Henry J. Hyde (R-IL) and ranking Democrat John Conyers (D-MI),
this bill enables Federal authorities to more quickly and efficiently
investigate and prosecute these cases and also protects the freedom
of religious expression.

<center><h2>WILL THERE BE ANY PRO-LIFERS IN THE BIG TENT?

<p>

GARY BAUER COMMENTS:</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The following is a statement from Gary
L. Bauer following up on Senator Dole's comments on CNN <i>Inside
Politics</i> regarding the pro-life plank in the platform:

<p>

&quot;Senator Dole had, this past weekend, navigated some tough
shoals.  Today the ship has been run a ground again. I hope sometime
soon the senator will stop debating fellow Republicans on abortion
and start debating the most pro-abortion President in American
history.  If this keeps up, the so-called big tent won't have
any pro-lifers in it.&quot;

<center><h2>BIG GOVERNMENT CAN'T STAND FOR CHILDREN<br>
BUT IT COULD STEP ASIDE FOR PARENTS,<br>
FRC STANDS WITH MOMS AND DADS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. -- &quot;If the tobacco lobby tried to rally
for smokers' rights, most people would mock their efforts</b>,
but when more than a 100 organizations that lobby for and receive
federal grant monies get together to pressure for more welfare
spending, they're treated as though the name of the event equals
reality. But to stand for children, you need to stand for families,
not big government,&quot; said Kristi S. Hamrick, Family Research
Council Director of Communications on Friday.

<p>

Mrs. Hamrick made her comments on the eve of the liberal Children's
Defense Fund &quot;Stand for Children&quot; rally set for June
1. She and other pro-family leaders stood together with families
who have had struggles in areas of taxes, adoption and education.
The news conference highlighted the many issues and organizations
pointedly unnoticed in the so-called &quot;non-partisan&quot;
event.

<p>

She said: <b>&quot;Big government doesn't best stand for children,
parents do</b>. And in the last 30 years, through excessive taxes,
failed welfare programs and overbearing federal control of education,
<b>parents have been squeezed out of the driver's seat of their
family cars, to be replaced by Big Brother. It's too bad he's
been headed in the wrong direction</b>.

<p>

&quot;During the last 40 years, the tax burden on the American
family has gone from one dollar in 50 to one dollar in four. It's
a reverse Robin Hood situation, taking from the poor to give to
bloated government programs and bureaucrats who act as though
they know what's best for other people's money and children.

<p>

&quot;<b>We need the $500 per child tax credit</b>. We need a
balanced budget. We need adoption tax credits. And we need them
now. We applaud the fact that Congress kept its promises and passed
this long overdue tax relief for families and began to address
the burden of debt that will be left to our children. Unfortunately,
liberal activists -- like the Children's Defense Fund -- prevailed
upon President Bill Clinton to veto this necessary tax relief
and balanced budget legislation.

<p>

<b>&quot;The Children's Defense Fund has embraced the attitude
that liberal elites know better</b> than parents. The goals of
federal policy should not be to replace the family or parents,
but to affirm them. In particular, we need to help those children
most in need get into stable families.

<p>

&quot;It is shameful that foster care, 'a temporary' program,
becomes a quasi-parent for more than 600,000 abused and neglected
children. Ten percent wait more than 7 years for the system to
give them legal, loving parents. These languishing children deserve
better. We can help them by freeing them for adoption after a
set period of time, and supporting adoption tax credits.

<p>

<b>&quot;It shouldn't surprise anyone</b> that the groups invited
to attend the rally -- groups like The Gay and Lesbian Victory
Fund, Planned Parenthood, Zero Population Growth, National Organization
for Women -- support government as surrogate parent. But men and
women nationwide understand that it's parents who best know and
best love their children. And for radical activists to claim that
they are advocates for children is so lacking in credibility,
it doesn't pass the straight face test.&quot;

<title>May 29, 1996 Press Release</title>

<body>

<font size=-1>

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
May 29, 1996 IN ADVANCE: June 1 Rally<br>
CONTACT: Kristi S. Hamrick -- (202) 393-2100. For Radio: Kristin Hansen.

<p>

<center><h2>TO THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND:<br>
THE <i>REAL</i> QUESTION IS WHO BEST STANDS FOR<br>
CHILDREN ... AND THE ANSWER IS PARENTS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. -- &quot;The best advocates of children today
-- and the most unappreciated -- are mothers and fathers, working
together to stand for children,&quot;</b> said Gary L. Bauer,
president of Family Research Council on Wednesday, May 29. &quot;The
best thing we could do as a society to stand for children is affirm
and support parents.&quot;

<p>

<b>Bauer made his comments on the eve of the Stand for Children
Rally</b> scheduled to take place on June 1 in Washington, D.C.
The rally was organized by the liberal Children's Defense Fund
known for supporting big government intervention in the family.

<p>

<b>&quot;For Children's Defense Fund</b>, the organizer of the
impressively-named 'Stand for Children' event, the best advocate
a child has is a government official or bureaucrat. But government
is often part of the problem, both by implementing family un-friendly
policies and diminishing the importance of the people who best
love children -- parents,&quot; said Bauer.

<p>

&quot;The Children's Defense Fund has embraced the attitude of
parents as 'guilty until proven innocent.'  But healthy societies
have understood that parents are almost always those who best
defend children. And only when the home has broken down should
the state intervene to save the child and assist in getting that
child permanently into a loving family.

<p>

<b>&quot;Family is key</b>. Children from broken families should
not be captives of temporary government solutions. It is shameful
that foster care, a 'temporary' program, becomes a quasi-parent
for more than 600,000 abused and neglected children.  Ten percent
wait more than seven years for the system to give them legal,
loving parents.  These languishing children deserve more than
'bought' foster care.  As one system child of 10 years said, 'I'm
all wrapped up in programs, what I need is a mom and a dad.'

<p>

&quot;Not surprisingly, the groups invited by CDF to attend the
rally were primarily those who believe that government should
be a child's best friend. In fact, despite well-spoken words about
faith in child rearing, an anti-faith attitude has marked CDF's
policies. Children's Defense Fund has been hostile to the role
religious organizations can play as advocates for children and
families in place of government.

<p>

<b>&quot;CDF has taken the attitude that experts know best</b>
--  rarely parents -- and have consistently fought against school
choice for parents and day care vouchers for poor parents who
want their children instructed in a values setting.

<p>

&quot;But most significantly, time and time again, the Children's
Defense Fund has missed the mark on <b>the greatest crisis facing
our children -- family breakdown</b>. For them, every problem
is an economic one, explained not in the loss of values or loving
homes, but in dollars and cents. The last 30 years has shown clearly
the failure of these approaches. Unless we all stand together
for the family, our society will fall.&quot;

<center><h2>BAUER CALLS<br>
AMENDMENT TWO DECISION<br>
'DISASTER FOR SELF-GOVERNING PEOPLE'</h2>

<p>

<h4>'THE COURT IS TAKING AWAY AMERICANS'<br>
FREEDOM TO DISAGREE ON HOMOSEXUALITY'</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Today's 6-3 Supreme Court decision
in <I>Romer v. Evans</I> is a disaster,&quot; said Gary L. Bauer,
President of the Family Research Council.  &quot;The legal details
will be debated, but the ruling's immediate impact is clear enough:
No state in the country may amend its constitution to bar the
granting of special rights for homosexuals.

<p>

&quot;No one -- including the people of Colorado -- is suggesting
that homosexuals should lose any rights; but nobody has the right
to 'win' at the ballot box even when losing.  Homosexual activists
lost at the ballot box, but now they will see their will imposed
on the people of Colorado -- and the rest of the nation -- by an 
out-of-control, unelected judiciary.

<p>

&quot;Now, with state laws being struck down, it is clear that
the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) is urgently needed.
Otherwise, marriage itself will be redefined radically by unrestrained
judges. DOMA may just be the antidote to the judicial lunacy.

<p>

&quot;As Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in a stinging dissent, 'Today's
opinion has no foundation in American constitutional law, and
barely pretends to.  The people of Colorado have adopted an entirely
reasonable provision which does not even disfavor homosexuals
in any substantive sense, but merely denies them preferential
treatment . . . Striking it down is an act, not of judicial judgment,
but of political will.'

<p>

Bauer continued: &quot;On yet another question of profound public
concern, the legislative voice of the American people has been
silenced.  Even the illusion of a level playing field evaporates
before our eyes.

<p>

&quot;Here's how it works:  Homosexuals may win laws providing
themselves with special rights, and Americans who disagree may
not pass any laws to the contrary. No other group has that kind
of power to impose its agenda on the rest of the people.  This
decision, apart from its policy consequences, should send chills
down the back of anyone who cares whether the people of this nation
any longer have the power of self-rule.&quot;

<center><h2>FAMILIES SHOULD NOT BE FORCED<br>
TO FUND CONDUCT UNBECOMING<br>
TO OUR NATIONAL HERITAGE</h2>

<p>

<h4>MEDIA INVITED TO VIEW VIDEOTAPED ACCOUNT</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Everyone -- the media and public
-- is invited to view a 6-minute videotape detailing some of the
events that transpired during the homosexual 'Cherry Jubilee'
parties held in taxpayer-funded government buildings in April,&quot;
Family Research Council Director of Cultural Studies Robert Knight
said Wednesday.  &quot;Rep. Steve Gunderson has said the events
at two parties have been misconstrued in a written eye-witness
account -- but a picture is worth a thousand words.&quot;

<p>

&quot;The Family Research Council became concerned about a possible
misuse of family tax dollars after reading lewd advertisements
for the events in homosexual publications and other media outlets.
The gay-friendly, Washington, D.C. libertarian newspaper <I>City
Paper</I> described the Cherry Jubilee Main Event Party as a &quot;gay
'circuit' party....Circuit parties are all-night -- and usually
drug-infested -- gay dances.&quot;

<p>

&quot;Video footage taken at the Main Event clearly shows half-naked
men dancing to a disco beat in the Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium,
a hall that has been used for presidential ceremonies,&quot; Knight
said.  &quot;And earlier footage shows the same auditorium hosting
the indescribably vulgar Sado-Masochistic Leather Fetish event
during the 1993 Homosexual March on Washington.  It is inappropriate
in the city of Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln for vulgar parties
thrown by anyone for any reason to be staged in our taxpayer-funded
facilities built to accomplish the noble goals of democracy. 
Hardworking American families should not be forced to facilitate
conduct unbecoming to our national heritage.  And the Rayburn
House Office Building should not be used for Sunday disco parties.

<p>

&quot;The offensive use of taxpayer-funded buildings set aside
for federal agencies and the business of the House shows that
the issue here is not 'tolerance.'  Unfortunately, that word has
been abused to force Americans to endorse, support and facilitate
offensive behavior.  And when people object to this abuse, they
are assailed as 'bigots' or 'haters.'&quot;

<p>

&quot;Despite Rep. Gunderson's words on the House floor that
nothing inappropriate took place, <b>here are four accounts to
note:</b>

<p><ul>

<li><i>&quot;...the dancing became increasingly lewd and
suggestive.  As the night wore on, the dancers began simulated
sex gyrations.  There was intense groping and stroking of each
other.  Some couples dancing on table tops, mimicked anal sex
through their clothing, while others pantomimed oral sex.....At
about 4 a.m., two men proceeded to engage in illicit sexual behavior
in the main auditorium.....oral intercourse....The restroom stalls
at the Mellon auditorium were constantly being occupied by two
men at a time....evidence of illegal drug use was present.  Audible
snorting could be heard throughout the evening in the bathroom
stalls.&quot;  -- free-lance video journalist Marc Morano in an
eye-witness account published in the Congressional Record.</i>

<p>

<li><i>&quot;Jim Jennings of Hill &amp; Knowlton, a sponsor
of the event, said he didn't witness drug use but added, 'I would
not be surprised, though, that in any group of 20-to-30-year-olds...[that]
there would be some who had done drugs...If it became clear that
[drug use] was a serious element of this event we'd stop it.'
Instead, he said he simply witnessed 'very provocative dancing.'&quot;
-- Paul Bedard, &quot;Gay GOP lawmaker defends 'Jubilee,'&quot;
The Washington Times, May 15, 1996, p. A-1.</i>

<p>

<li><i>&quot;I saw a couple of instances of people in a
corner using drugs...a fair number of people using drugs.&quot;
-- City Paper homosexual reporter John Cloud, as quoted in The
Washington Times.</i>

<p>

<li><i>&quot;The stately place was incredible -- we felt like
we were in a hallowed hall. We spent much of our time out on the
dance floor trying to cop a feel, or back in the sponsors' lounge
trying to cop a feel, or outside in the designated smoking area
trying to cop a feel and a smoke.&quot; -- columnist in the homosexual
Metro Weekly, as quoted in The Washington Times.</i>

</ul><p>

&quot;Pro-family Americans are tired of having their values disparaged
and their tax dollars wasted on undignified personal agendas,&quot;
Knight said. &quot;These charges are serious enough that they
should be investigated by Congress, by the Metro Police and by
the General Services Administration, which is responsible for
events at the Mellon Auditorium.&quot;

<center><h2>DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT IS &quot;IN<br>
CIVILIZATION'S BEST INTEREST,&quot;<br>
BAUER SAYS</h2>

<p>

<h4>FRC URGES HOUSE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT H.R. 3396</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The Defense of Marriage Act (H.R. 3396)
&quot;is one of the most urgent and essential pieces of legislation
to be considered in this century.  The institution of marriage
must not be taken lightly,&quot; said Family Research Council
President Gary Bauer. &quot;Clearly, those who care deeply about
children, about morality, about the well being of the larger society,
must resist the attempts by a tiny segment of the population to
diminish the foundation on which society stands.&quot;   Bauer
made these comments as the House Judiciary Constitution Subcommittee
held a hearing on the legislation that would preserve marriage
from being redefined by state courts.

<p>

Sponsored by Representatives Steve Largent (R-OK) and Bob Barr
(R-GA) and with a companion bill introduced by Senator Don Nickles
(R-OK), the Defense of Marriage Act would protect the traditional
definition of marriage as a legal union between one man and one
woman in the U.S. Code, and also protect states from any redefinitions
imposed by courts.

<p>

The issue of the definition of marriage has been quickly raised
to the federal level because it is widely believed that the Hawaiian
courts will soon take the radical step of striking down that state's
marriage law. Under the Constitution's &quot;full faith and credit&quot;
clause (Article IV), this decision could jeopardize marriage laws
in the other 49 states.

<p>

&quot;Marriage has been the foundation of civilization for thousands
of years in cultures around the world. It is the single most important
social institution, and it is the basis for the procreation of
children and the heart of family life,&quot; Bauer said. &quot;Marriage
is a societal good even without children, as husbands and wives
serve as role models for children in their neighborhoods. Marriage
between one man and one woman gives children the best economic,
emotional, and psychological environment in which to grow up.

<p>

&quot;We must step up our efforts to defend marriage now.  Instead
of submitting to radical demands that would destroy marriage,
we need to restore the primacy of marriage within the law and
the culture.&quot;

<center><h2>FRC LABELS NEEDLE EXCHANGE<br>
PROGRAMS BAD MEDICINE FOR<br>
FIGHTING AIDS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;The fight to establish federally-funded
needle exchange programs is being urged as a wedge issue to gain
drug legalization,&quot; Family Research Council's policy analyst
Robert Maginnis said today.  &quot;Linking drug addiction with
the emotion-charged AIDS epidemic under the pro-drug umbrella
called 'harm reduction' may be good political strategy, but it's
an awful idea that is gathering momentum, and it must be countered.
Needle exchange programs are simply bad medicine.&quot; 

<p>

Maginnis spoke today at the National Conference of State Legislatures
on the topic, &quot;Getting to the Point: The Role of Sterile
Syringes in HIV Prevention.&quot;

<p>

Needle exchange programs are intended to curb the practice of
sharing needles among injecting drug users to reduce the risk
of transmitting the AIDS virus.  Exchange advocates claim that
the science conclusively supports these programs, however on close
examination the science is seriously flawed.

<p>

&quot;The science downplays sexual transmission of HIV among addicts,&quot;
Maginnis said.  &quot;Some resort to prostitution to fund their
addiction.  After all, non-needle-using crack addicts have a high
incidence of HIV. Most of the needle studies fail to interview
neighborhood residents to see whether they approve of the effect
of these programs.  They also tend to trivialize the drug problem
and offer no alternative solutions.

<p>

&quot;Needle exchanges promote a breakdown in law and order. They
are poor medicine and poor public health practice. Our goal should
be to eliminate drug abuse, not find a safer way to do it.  The
best way to curb the spread of HIV among injecting drug users
is to get them off drugs.&quot;

<center><h2>DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE IS &quot;CULTURAL<br>
WATERSHED,&quot; BAUER SAYS</h2>

<p>

<h4>FRC GIVES FULL SUPPORT TO DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT</h4></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA)
&quot;is one of the most crucial pieces of legislation to be considered
in this or any year. This is a cultural watershed,&quot; said
Family Research Council President Gary Bauer. &quot;Will America
move to protect marriage -- the foundation of civilization --
or will America become the first nation to destroy marriage? At
stake is nothing less than the future of the nation and the well
being of our children.&quot;

<p>

The Defense of Marriage Act was announced today in the House and
the Senate, and Family Research Council gave its full support
to the legislation that would protect marriage against current
attempts to redefine it.  Sponsored by Representatives Steve Largent
(R-OK) and Bob Barr (R-GA) and with a companion bill introduced
by Senator Don Nickles (R-OK), the Defense of Marriage Act would
protect the traditional definition of marriage as a legal union
between one man and one woman in the U.S. Code, and thus protect
states from any redefinitions imposed by courts.

<p>

The issue of the definition of marriage was raised to the federal
level because it is widely believed that the Hawaiian Supreme
Court will soon take the radical step of striking down the state's
marriage law. Under the Constitution's &quot;full faith and credit&quot;
clause (Article IV), this decision could jeopardize marriage laws
in the other 49 states.

<p>

Bauer noted that more than 30 states have legislative activities
underway to address this threat and 9 have already enacted such
laws. But because marriage is referenced in the U.S. Code, the
Uniform Code of Military Justice, and in Social Security regulations,
federal law is necessary to ensure that no state would be forced
to submit to a redefinition of marriage should another state's
court system take that step.

<p>

&quot;The heart of family life is marriage,&quot; Bauer said.
&quot;It brings the two sexes together in a unique legal, social,
economic and spiritual union -- no other relationship provides
society with the benefits that marriage does. As we have drifted
from the defense of marriage, we have experienced severe social
and economic problems, and now, marriage is under attack as never
before. If the one-man, one-woman definition of marriage is broken,
there is no logical stopping point for continuing the assault
on marriage. No civilization has ever introduced a counterfeit
definition of marriage, and those who have allowed the family
to be weakened have not survived.&quot;

<center><h2>HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES DISQUALIFY<br>
CHINA FROM RECEIVING<br>
&quot;MOST FAVORED NATION&quot; STATUS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The Family Research Council on Tuesday
urged the Clinton Administration to revoke China's &quot;most
favored nation&quot; trade status because of China's myriad human
rights abuses.

<p>

Policy Analyst Gracie Hsu released the following statement prior
to the press conference held by the Coalition to Stop MFN for
China: 

<p>

&quot;China's horrific record on human rights is undisputable.
Its blatant disregard for the sanctity of human life has led
to such abuses as the massacre of democracy-seekers at Tiannanmen
Square, the exploitation of prisoners as slave laborers, women
being forcibly aborted or sterilized, female infanticide, and
the systematic intimidation, torture, and imprisonment of Christians.

<p>

&quot;In the 15 years since the United States has granted China
'most favored nation' trade status, our economic 'open door' policy
has not resulted in even one of these human rights abuses being
halted or abated.  Even if there was, at one point, justification
for extending MFN status to China, arguing that economic trade
might lead to greater influence in the human rights realm, China's
record of continued human rights abuses should completely dispel
that notion.

<p>

&quot;Up to now, the Clinton Administration has only paid lip
service to human rights.  For even while Hillary Clinton was verbally
condemning coercive abortion policies last September in Beijing,
President Clinton was refusing to grant asylum to several Chinese
women who fled their homeland to escape their country's forced
abortion policies.  It is time for President Clinton to put actions
to his words.

<p>

&quot;The oppressive nature of this Chinese government regime
is well-known.  And if the United States does not use the carrot
of its economic markets to encourage China to a humane standard,
then the stick should be the closing of our economic doors.

<p>

&quot;Those obsessed with the idea that there is money to be made
in China seem to forget that the United States is the richest
market in the world and has a lot to offer or withhold. If all
that we communicate to the world is that money making is our only
value, then we cannot be surprised when dictators rise to power,
promising only economic concessions while people die.&quot;

<center><h2>FRC SUPPORTS DEFENSE BILL<br>
CUTTING GOVERMENT'S ROLE AS<br>
PORNOGRAPHY SALESMAN</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The U.S. House of Representative's
National Defense Committee passed by voice vote an amendment today
to the 1997 Defense Authorization Act that would prohibit the
sale or rental of pornography anywhere on U.S. military property.

<p>

Robert Maginnis, FRC's director for the Military Readiness Project
and a retired Army lieutenant colonel, said &quot;This legislation
will aid in strengthening the moral character of our military
personnel, as well as protect the military family. Sexually explicit
material intended to appeal to prurient interests should not be
sold in government stores.&quot;

<p>

But in 1995, the Army Air Force Exchange Service sold more than
$5 million of pornographic materials and today the Pentagon's
bookstore sells <I>Playboy, Penthouse, Playgirl, Penthouse Letters,
Penthouse Comics and Penthouse Men's Adventure Comix</I>. 

<p>

According to Colonel Maginnis, &quot;Pornographic material, like
alcohol, is a powerful stimulant.  Beginning with 'soft'  pornography
sold in military stores, the desire for sexually explicit material
grows to require more explicit images in order to reach the previous
level of sexual arousal.  Gradually, the addict becomes desensitized
even to the more explicit material and may act out sexual fantasies
inspired by the material.&quot;

<p>

The Military Honor and Decency Act comes in the wake of the rape
of a 12-year-old girl in Okinawa by a U.S. sailor and two Marines,
and the groping of a female sailor by a drunken chief petty officer
on a commercial flight.

<p>

Under current policy, military store managers select magazines
based on sales volume, customer preferences, and, in the case
of pornographic material, whether it fits the definition of obscenity
outlined by the Supreme Court. The high court's criteria were
written to protect freedom of speech and expression but there
are kinds not protected by the Constitution.  These include, among
others, slander, libel, perjury, yelling &quot;fire&quot; in a
crowded theater and child pornography.

<p>

&quot;The government should not be involved in the distribution
of material that conflicts with the principles of honor and decency,&quot;
said Maginnis.  &quot;With the growing number of sexual misconduct
cases in the military, it is time the federal government sever
its involvement in the pornography trade.&quot;

<center><h2>GOVERNMENT SHOULD DO UNTO OTHERS...<br>
ORDINARY PEOPLE DESERVE THE SAME PERKS<br>
AS FEDERAL WORKERS, BAUER SAYS</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council President Gary
L. Bauer joined with Sen. John Ashcroft Tuesday in calling for
increased workplace flexibility and more &quot;comp time&quot;
options. Currently, laws on a 40-hour workweek prohibit flexible
schedules, and rather than merely offer time-and-a-half money
for overtime work, comp time could be expanded to offer time-and-a-half-off
options as well.

<p>

Bauer made the following comments during a 3 p.m. news conference
in S-211 of the U.S. Capitol:

<p>

&quot;Ironically, the federal government has boasted of its success
in providing flexible scheduling for the people who fill its ranks
... but rank and file Americans don't have the same options. Government
should do unto others what it has done for itself -- remove the
restrictions on a work week and allow freedom to enter the kinds
of  start-up businesses that are on the cutting edge of growth
and opportunity. And to allow those businesses which built America
to offer the same options that federal workers receive.

<p>

&quot;Recent focus groups have shown that women in particular
are deeply concerned about the amount of  time they have to spend
together as a family. Children's schedules are not always compatible
with corporate America. We need to get government bureaucrats
out of the scheduling business that takes place between employers
and employees who are juggling jobs and families. A recent study
conducted by the Family and Work Institute found that 66 percent
of employed families with children under 18 indicated that they
didn't have enough time for their children. And an original poll,
conducted for the Family Research Council, showed that 61 percent
of Americans favor more time over more money. We have the ability
to address the Family Time Famine in America.

<p>

&quot;Increasing opportunity is a women's issue, a children's
issue and most particularly, a family issue.

<p>

&quot;And I would also urge the Congress to adopt the $500 per
child tax credit, because it would reduce economic pressures on
families, thereby freeing parents to spend more time with their
children. These are the kinds of changes that men and women desired
when they voted for a change in Washington D.C. And I commend
Sen. Ashcroft's leadership in spearheading this positive change
in today's workplace.&quot;

<center><h4>EDITORS' NOTE: REPORTS INDICATE CLINTON TO RELEASE 
PARTIAL-BIRTH VETO STATEMENT AT 5 P.M.</h4>

<p>

<h2>CLINTON SHOWS SHOCKING DISREGARD FOR THE VALUES OF THE 
<i>MAJORITY</i> OF AMERICANS, AGAIN REWARDS PRO-ABORTION ALLIES</h2>

<p>

<h3><i>&quot;Clinton seems to find no life worth saving</i>,&quot;
says Bauer</h3></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Clinton's veto of  the overwhelmingly
supported Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act shows once again his
absolute loyalty to the most extreme abortion advocates,&quot;
Family Research Council President Gary L. Bauer said on Wednesday.

<p>

Bauer made the following statement after Clinton vetoed the Partial-Birth
Abortion Ban Act -- a measure which passed both houses with wider
margins than almost any bill this session.

<p>

Bauer noted: &quot;Polling out this week shows once again that
the vast majority of Americans -- more than two-thirds -- support
either restrictions on abortion or its elimination. These numbers
tell a story that every man and woman of conscience understands.
People do not want to see life casually ended. And they do not
accept abortion as the highest and best offering of our great
Constitution. They are troubled by a 1.5-million person death
count every year. And the overwhelming success of pro-life candidates
in the last election, both Democratic and Republican, underscores
the troubled electorate's concern for run-away abortion 'rights'
turned into societal wrongs.

<p>

&quot;Bill Clinton has again aligned himself with the most extremist
elements of the abortion lobby -- those who see no value in life
poised on the edge of birth. Bill Clinton said he wants abortion
to be rare, but he seems to see no life worth saving, not even
a fully viable child, whose living brain tissue is vacuumed out,
causing painful death.

<p>

&quot;I am among the majority of Americans who knows that our
nation has more to offer than abortion. And from my travels around
the country, I can say for certain that this veto will mark the
Bill Clinton presidency with a stain that will not be white washed
with any amount of election rhetoric.&quot;

<center><h2>FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL<br>
DEFENDS MILITARY LAW<br>
IN <i>RICHENBERG V. PERRY</i></h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> <I>Richenberg v. Perry</I>, a military
case that involves a former air force captain challenging his
discharge for homosexuality, will be heard today in a federal
appeals court in St. Louis, Missouri.  The Family Research Council's
Military Readiness Project, the only national group actively defending
the military's legal ban in court, filed an amicus curiae brief
defending the federal law.  MRP representatives will be attending
the case in St. Louis and will be available for interviews. 

<p>

MRP Director Robert Maginnis, a retired Lieutenant Colonel, explains,
&quot;FRC is in court because the Clinton administration refuses
to defend the law.  Rather, it defends a faulty implementation
of the law labeled &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; which permits
homosexuals to serve.  The American people, the law and military
tradition have spoken clearly on this issue:  homosexuals are
not permitted to serve in the armed forces.&quot;

<p>

MRP counsel Melissa Wells-Petry, a former Army litigator, wrote
in the brief that Richenberg's case is fatally flawed when it
attacks the &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; implementing regulations.
&quot;This policy,&quot; she says, is only &quot;a political myth.&quot;
According to Wells-Petry, Richenberg's case argues that &quot;treating
detected and undetected homosexuals differently in terms of eligibility
for military service renders the policy irrational, in that it
furthers no legitimate governmental goal&quot; by sifting homosexuals
into two camps, separated only by detection.  On this, she notes,
&quot;No doubt the policy described by Richenberg might pose the
constitutional questions he attempts to raise.  But no such policy
is at issue in this case.&quot;

<p>

In addition, she holds that the Department of Justice does not
even need to defend the regulations.  Instead, the law passed
by Congress, 10 U.S.C. &#167; 654, is what really is at issue
and is quite clear:  all homosexuals are barred from service.
Thus, there is no legal loophole through which homosexuals can
serve in the military.  The Military Readiness Project has long
maintained that the real problem is the Clinton Administration's
persistence in claiming the law permits homosexuals to serve instead
of enforcing the law's true intent, namely, to codify the armed
forces' long and constitutional policy of prohibiting homosexual
service.

<p>

MRP has provided briefs in similar cases concerning homosexual
servicemembers.  In the 4th Circuit case of <I>Thomasson v. Perry</I>,
it was given the unusual opportunity to make oral arguments before
the full court.

<p>

The <I>Richenberg</I> case is one of eight appellate cases making
their way to the Supreme Court. It's expected that either the
2nd Circuit's <I>Abel</I> case or the <I>Thomasson</I> case will
likely be heard on appeal by the high court in its next session.

<center><h2>BAUER TO EDUCATION SUMMIT:<br>
&quot;Empowering Parents helps Kids&quot;</h2></center>

<p>

<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;When all is said and done, the
highest goal of an education summit should be our children's improved
learning,&quot; Family Research Council President Gary Bauer said
on Tuesday as the Governor's Education summit began. Bauer, undersecretary
of education during the Reagan Administration, urged the attendees
of the summit to focus their attention on initiatives that help
children -- not bureaucrats.

<p>

&quot;We know that these kinds of meetings over the years have
made the participants feel good, but on the whole, they've done
little to improve American education,&quot; Bauer said. &quot;But
when it comes to our kids, it's worth the effort to find what
really works. I would urge the attendees to follow these principles:

<p><b>

<li>Empower Parents not bureaucrats.<br>
<li>Reject the anti-American National History Standards<br>
<li>Submit any agreements made at the summit to the American
people.

</b><p>

&quot;I do not believe government-funded or endorsed national
standards will increase local control or lead to better education,&quot;
Bauer said. &quot;Summit leaders can score real achievement by
voting to reject the outrageously biased, anti-American history
standards.  Proponents of national standards have had a difficult
time assuring the American people that their standards would be
high enough to make America internationally competitive and at
the same time low enough so that the vast majority of students
could achieve to such levels.&quot;

<p>

Bauer noted that a goal since the Reagan Administration was to
dismantle the U.S. Department of Education. &quot;Governors have
a keen interest in education. They therefore should support calls
for abolishing the Department of Education. We need to bring decision
making authority back to local schools and local leaders.&quot;

<p>

&quot;But no matter what is agreed upon,&quot; Bauer said, &quot;I
urge the governors not to sign any agreement that has not been
released for public comment in their states.  I urge CEO's not
to sign any agreement that would increase government interference
with the American economy. American students deserve our best
efforts in their behalf.&quot;

<center><h2>CLINTON WRONG AGAIN ON<br>
TEENS AND AIDS</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> A White House report issued today shows
that 25 percent of Americans who are infected with AIDS each year
are under the age of 20.  The report calls for more explicit AIDS
education, and HIV testing without parental notice.
<p>
&quot;This is a policy-driven tragedy unfolding, and the Clinton
Administration is offering only more of the same prescription
that got us here in the first place,&quot; said Family Research
Council Director of Cultural Studies Robert H. Knight.  &quot;To
say that lack of information is causing the problem is outrageous.
The schools inundate children with graphic sex information beginning
in kindergarten, and when record numbers of teens experiment and
contract diseases and unwanted pregnancies, the answer, we are
told, is always more of the same -- more condoms, more 'education,'
more knowledge of deviant sex practices -- and less parental input.
<p>
&quot;Teens themselves have told reporters that information is
not the problem -- it's the presentation of sex as an inevitable
plumbing exercise in a sex-saturated culture, without regard for
marriage.  According to a University of Minnesota study by a homosexual
researcher, young males &quot;often engaged in high-risk sex despite
good knowledge about HIV.&quot;  The teens &quot;correctly recognized
they were more likely than others to be infected, but were not
deterred from dangerous behavior.&quot;  (Dr. Gary Remafedi, survey
of 239 gay and bisexual males aged 13 to 21, 1994).
<p>
Knight adds, &quot;The condom-based approach has failed miserably
for 20 years and ruined countless lives.  Good programs are available
that work, but the Clinton Administration and their allies are
trying to kill them off.  And the same government that wants to
steal children's innocence now wants to test them for HIV without
parents' knowledge.
<p>
&quot;Parents across America are vitally concerned about their
children's well-being, and they -- not the government -- should be
the primary counselor in their child's sexual development,&quot;
Knight said.  &quot;Parents must not be cut out of their children's
lives, especially if their child's life is in jeopardy. No one
should face HIV test results alone,&quot; Knight said.

<center><h2>MILITARY CASE <i>PHILIPS V. PERRY</i><br>
TESTS HOMOSEXUAL LAW</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C.</b> --  In Seattle today, a Federal Appeals
court will <I>hear Philips v. Perry</I>, a case involving an openly
homosexual sailor who admitted to past misconduct and who intends
to continue that practice.  On October 27, 1995, the Family Research
Council filed a friend of the court brief calling for the dismissal
of the case.
<p>
Lieutenant Colonel Robert L. Maginnis (U.S.A., Ret.), FRC's director
of the Military Readiness Project (MRP) will attend the Seattle
hearing.  He said, &quot;Machinist Mate Mark Philips confessed
to homosexual misconduct in 1992 but he filed a lawsuit blocking
his discharge.&quot;  FRC first joined this case in early 1995
by filing a court brief at the trial court level.  Philips lost
that challenge.
<p>
&quot;Philips is a homosexual crusader,&quot; said Colonel Maginnis,
&quot;who wants to use the court to air and resolve national policy
on homosexuals in the military and in particular Congress' constitutional
authority to dictate military personnel policy.&quot;
<p>
Machinist Mate Philips claims that his discharge is based on homosexual
&quot;status&quot; when in fact the Navy board was swayed by his
admission of misconduct.  He also claims there are sexual acts
that are guaranteed within a constitutionally protected zone of
privacy.
<p>
This case is one of five military homosexual cases now pending
at the Federal Appellate Court level and three cases at the Federal
District Court level.  The MRP is involved in all the appellate
cases as an amicus and had the unusual opportunity last December
to make oral arguments before the Fourth Circuit's <I>Thomasson
v. Perry</I> hearing. 
<p>
As the nation's leading organization defending the military's
ban, FRC argues that many of these cases came about because the
Clinton administration purposely did an end run around the law
and wrote implementing regulations labeled &quot;Don't Ask, Don't
Tell&quot; which permit homosexuals to serve.  The law prohibits
service by homosexuals.

<title>February 28, 1996 Press Release</title>
<body>
<center><h2>MEMO</h2></center>
<p>
<b>February 28, 1996
<p>
TO:     National News Media<br>
FROM:   Gary L. Bauer, President, Family Research Council<br>
RE:     Statement on Religious Bigotry in Media Coverage</b>
<p>
<b>Religious bigotry, and facile appeals to such bigotry, have no place in the 
American political lexicon.</b> In the past few weeks, some media coverage of 
the 1996 Presidential campaign has betrayed a disturbing insensitivity to the
standards of civil discourse that our nation's founders intended to prevail in
public debate.  Last Friday night's edition of ABC's Nightline is only the latest
example of this insensitivity, an uncharacteristically superficial report by Ted
Koppel that attempted to legitimize the idea that American Catholics in the
1940s and 1950s were given to reflexive prejudice against their fellow Jewish
Americans.
<p>
<B>Americans of all faiths -- and even no faith -- cherish a heritage of religious 
liberty that celebrates the contributions of diverse denominations to our 
national life.</b>  They honor the examples of tolerance and courage that abound
in our history, from Sam Adams' call that the First Continental Congress open
with the prayer of a clergyman not of his own denomination, to the famed
incident of the four chaplains -- a rabbi, a Methodist minister, a
Catholic priest, and a Dutch Reformed minister -- who sacrificed their 
life-jackets to other men and perished in the sinking of the troop ship 
Dorchester in July 1943.
<p>
<b>Prejudice has certainly written dark chapters in every era of American 
history, but ABC breaches its responsibility to the American people when it 
paints a misleading and malignant portrait of American Catholics.</b>  As an
organization representing hundreds of thousands of American families, including
Catholics, the Family Research Council deplores ABC's report.  We urge everyone
engaged in coverage of the 1996 elections to maintain the highest standards
of journalistic ethics and to cover the issues with factuality and fairness. ABC
owes all religious people of goodwill a swift and heartfelt apology.

<center><h2>CLINTON WRONG ON PARTIAL BIRTH</h2>
<p>
<h4>PRO-LIFE AMERICANS AND CLINTON KNOW THAT<br>
HEALTH OF THE MOTHER = ALL ABORTIONS</h4></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council Policy Analyst
Gracie Hsu made the following statement following President Clinton's
comments regarding his new position on the Partial Birth Abortion
Ban Act:
<p>
&quot;After Congressional hearings and extended public debate
and no doubt prayerful consideration, members of both houses of
Congress, on both sides of the aisle, passed a bill which would
ban partial birth abortions.  However, President Clinton has now
announced that, after 'praying' long and hard, he will support
the late-term abortions of babies who are breech-delivered alive
until all but the head remains in the mother's womb, and who die
because the abortionist stabs the back of their heads to suction
out their brains.
<p>
&quot;That President Clinton would veto a ban on a procedure characterized
as 'four-fifths infanticide and one-fifth abortion' shows his
clear disregard for the value of human life.
<p>
&quot;Even worse, Mr. Clinton has tried to cloud his extreme pro-abortion
stance by saying that he, in fact, supports the ban except 'to
save the life of the mother and <I><B>for the mother's health</B></I>.'
<p>
&quot;The Partial Birth Abortion Ban, as passed by both houses
of Congress, already includes a life of the mother exception.
But the health clause that President Clinton seeks to include
is so broadly defined in U.S. law that it would make <b>all</b>
partial-birth abortions acceptable, including the 80 percent of
partial birth abortions that are performed for purely elective
reasons.
<p>
&quot;The 1973 <I>Doe v. Bolton</I> Supreme Court decision defined
'health' as encompassing '<I>all</I> factors -- physical, <I>emotional,
psychological, familial</I>, and the woman's age -- relevant to
the <I>well-being</I> of the patient' (emphasis added).  As a
Yale Law school graduate, President Clinton is completely aware
that adding a health exception to the partial birth abortion ban
would render the bill meaningless.  And his attempts to deceive
the public by talking about prayer and health will not overcome
the overwhelming objections to this heinous form of infanticide.&quot;

<center><h2>SUING SUCCESSES, FLAUNTING FAILURES:<br>
HENRY FOSTER'S RECORD<br>
ON TEEN PREGNANCY</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C.</b> -- Family Research Council Policy Analyst
Gracie Hsu made the following statement Wednesday in response
to President Clinton's teen pregnancy task force under the leadership
of failed Surgeon General nominee Dr. Henry Foster:
<p>
&quot;<B>Dr. Foster and Planned Parenthood</B> -- Dr. Henry Foster
has had a long-time association with Planned Parenthood and promotes
its goals.  Dr. Foster was a member of the Board of Directors
for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America (PPFA) for several
years beginning in 1975.  In 1989, Dr. Foster served on PPFA's
National Leadership Committee in their Campaign to Keep Abortion
Safe and Legal, the main purpose of which was to fight against
parental consent laws, waiting periods, and other moderate restrictions
that states have the right to set.  In 1992, Dr. Foster was one
of PPFA's Public Policy Advocates, promoting PPFA's goals and
programs in the public policy realm.
<p>
&quot;<B>Suing Successes</B> -- Planned Parenthood has filed lawsuits
against pregnancy prevention programs that work.  For example,
in Hemet, California, Planned Parenthood sued to remove three
successful abstinence programs -- <I>Teen-Aid, Sex Respect, </I>and<I>
Choosing the Best</I> -- from the school district.  In independent
evaluations, all three abstinence programs proved to reduce the
teen sexual activity level, the teen pregnancy rate, and help
change students' attitudes towards saving sex until marriage.
In Jacksonville, Florida, Planned Parenthood filed a lawsuit
against <I>Teen-Aid</I> despite the fact that Teen-Aid reduced
the teen pregnancy rate by 35 percent just 3 years after its implementation.
<p>
&quot;<B>Flaunting Failures</B> -- Dr. Foster sought to become
Surgeon General on the platform of combatting teen pregnancy due
to his experience with his own Nashville-based program, &quot;I
Have A Future&quot; (IHAF).  But IHAF's contraceptive-based approach
was a proven failure -- participants in the program actually showed
<I>higher</I> rates of sexual activity than those outside of the
program, according to a Carnegie Corporation evaluation.  These
results are consistent with other contraceptive-based programs
-- all of which show an increase in sexual activity rates, teen
pregnancy rates, and increased exposure to sexually-transmitted
diseases.
<p>
&quot;<B>What's Wrong With This Picture?</B> -- Why has President
Clinton chosen Dr. Foster as his senior advisor on teen pregnancy
when it is clear that Dr. Foster's policies and philosophy have
failed?  And, why has Mike McCurry said that the task force will
pursue contraceptive-based approaches when research clearly shows
that such approaches only put our children at higher risk?  Most
of all, why select a senior advisor on teen pregnancy who associates
himself with suing prevention programs that do indeed work?  President
Clinton, the American people await your answer.&quot;

<center><h2>CHALLENGE TO PRESIDENT CLINTON:<br>
SUPPORT <i>REAL</i> PREVENTION OF<br>
TEENAGE PREGNANCY</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C.</b> -- Family Research Council Policy Analyst
Gracie Hsu made the following statement Tuesday in response to
President Clinton's newly formed task force to combat teen pregnancy
under the leadership of failed Surgeon General nominee Dr. Henry
Foster:
<p>
&quot;<b>For the Record --</b> In his State of the Union address,
President Clinton said that he would form an organization which
would 'support grass-roots community efforts all across our country
in a national campaign against teen pregnancy.'
<p>
&quot;<b>Abstinence Programs Work</b> -- If President Clinton
is really serious about decreasing the teenage pregnancy rate,
he needs to look no further than the myriad of successful abstinence
programs around the country.
<p><ul>
<li>For example, <I>Best Friends</I> is a program which connects
teenage girls with mentors and utilizes the benefits of positive
peer pressure to promote abstinence.  A recent evaluation showed
that only 1.1 percent of its participants became pregnant, as
opposed to the 25 percent pregnancy rate for other girls in the
city.
<p>
<li>An evaluation of <I>Sex Respect</I>, an abstinence-based curriculum,
found that students participating in the program had considerably
lower pregnancy rates than those in a comparison group (5 percent
vs. 9 percent).
<p>
<li>Since Jacksonville, Florida (the fifteenth largest school
district in the nation) implemented the abstinence curriculum
<I>Teen-Aid</I> three years ago, the rate of teen pregnancy has
dropped by 35 percent.
<p>
<li>Other successful programs abound such as <I>True Love Waits</I>,
<I>Reasonable Reasons To Wait</I>, <I>Choosing the Best</I>, and
<I>AANCHOR</I>, among others.  And the one common denominator
in all these programs is that they emphasize abstinence and character
development.
</ul><p>
&quot;<B>Contraceptive-Based Approaches Fail</B> -- The data are
clear:  President Clinton should not support contraceptive-based
programs because they have proven to fail, increasing not only
the teen pregnancy rate but also teen sexual activity.
<p><ul>
<li>A study using data from the 1988 National Survey of Adolescent
Males (NSAM) found that adolescent males who had been instructed
in sexual biology and birth control were at a higher risk of early
intercourse than were those who had received no instruction.
<p>
<li>After Balboa High School in San Francisco instituted a condom
availability program, the school's overall teenage pregnancy rate
increased by a fourth in just two years.
<p>
<li>A recent <I>Washington Times</I> article reported that teen
pregnancy rates are higher in states that teach condom use than
in states that eschew sex education or stress abstinence.
<p>
<li>Participants in Dr. Henry Foster's Nashville-based program,
&quot;<I>I Have A Future</I>,&quot; actually showed higher rates
of sexual activity than those outside of the program, according
to a Carnegie Corporation evaluation.
</ul><p>
&quot;<B>What Will The Future Record Show?</B> -- The real question
is, will the Clinton/Foster task force support the abstinence
programs which have proven successful in reducing not only teenage
pregnancy, but also teenage sexual activity?  Or, will the task
force continue to support failed contraceptive programs and policies,
such as Dr. Foster's very own &quot;I Have A Future&quot; program?
<p>
&quot;We urge the President to carefully examine the data.  The
Family Research Council hopes that this task force will support
SUCCESS over IDEOLOGY.&quot;

<center><h2>PROMOTING FAILED POLICIES ON<br>
TEEN PREGNANCY:<br>
DR. HENRY FOSTER, TAKE 2</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C.</b> -- Family Research Council Policy Analyst
Gracie Hsu made the following statement Monday in response to
President Clinton's newly formed task force to combat teen pregnancy
headed by failed Surgeon General nominee Dr. Henry Foster:
<p>
&quot;<B>Disappointing -- </B>Bill Clinton in his State of the
Union Address sounded a very loud call for sounder values in society.
We were skeptical but hopeful that he intended to follow through
with the ideas expressed in his speech. Unfortunately, this appointment
shows that that is not the case.
<p>
&quot;<B>Replicating Failure -- </B>When President Clinton nominated
Dr. Henry Foster for Surgeon General, he said that he wanted Foster's
program, 'I Have A Future' replicated throughout the nation. 
But part of  the reason Dr. Foster was rejected as Surgeon General
was because his program, like all contraceptive-based programs,
was a proven failure.  Participants in Dr. Foster's 'I Have A
Future' program actually showed <I>higher</I> rates of sexual
activity than those outside of the program, according to a Carnegie
Corporation evaluation.
<p>
&quot;During Dr. Foster's confirmation hearings, Senator Nancy
Kassebaum (R-KS) said that 'the bottom line' was that 'there were
difficulties' (with Foster's program), including a 'dropout rate
[of]...at least 47.6 percent.'
<p>
&quot;<B>What Works?</B> -- Evaluation studies are crystal clear:
the only programs that really work to reduce teen pregnancy are
ABSTINENCE programs.  During his State of the Union address, President
Clinton noted that the teen pregnancy rate has dropped for two
years in a row.  The reason for this decline is <b>not</b> due
to federally-funded &quot;safe sex&quot; programs nor Joycelyn
Elders' conscience-assaulting promotion of condoms. Rather<I><B>,
teen pregnancy is declining because more teens are choosing abstinence</B></I>
despite all of the federal government's efforts to promote the
contrary. Statistics published by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention show that the decrease in teen pregnancy rates
is concurrent with the rising number of teens choosing to abstain
from sex.
<p>
&quot;<B>Lacking Common Sense</B> -- Why has the President appointed
Dr. Henry Foster to head a task force to combat teen pregnancy
when Dr. Foster's own program has a proven track record of failure?
Why has the President ignored all the data about the effectiveness
of abstinence-based programs and instead chosen to promote a failed
policy nationwide?
<p>
&quot;The American people rejected Joycelyn Elders, Kristine Gebbie,
and Dr. Henry Foster because they all promoted the same disastrous
policies.  Each of them was finally ousted because of the outcry
of the American people against their programs.  The President
should know that he cannot escape accountability simply by giving
Dr. Foster a back door by which to enter to do more harm to our
children.&quot;

<center><h2>FORGET DEMOCRATIC AND REPUBLICAN SPINNING<br>
WHAT IS A PRO-FAMILY PLATFORM?<br>
HOW CAN YOU KNOW WHO WILL FIGHT FOR IT?<br>
<p>
THERE IS A SINGLE SOURCE.<br>
<i>OUR HOPES, OUR DREAMS</i></h2></center>
<p>
<B>WASHINGTON, D.C</B>. -- &quot;At Family Research Council, we
don't endorse candidates. But we want <b>every</b> candidate to
deal with the breakdown of values and the disintegration of the
family that is eroding the America of our hopes and dreams,&quot;
said Gary L. Bauer, president of Family Research Council and author
of the soon-to-be released <I><B>Our Hopes, Our Dreams: A Vision
for America.</B></I>
<p>
<b>This book is the answer to the most asked questions</b>, &quot;What
do you want for America?&quot; and &quot;What do you want people
to do about it?&quot; Gary Bauer is uniquely qualified to answer
those questions. His almost 30 years in political life include
serving President Ronald Reagan as domestic policy advisor and
serving as undersecretary of education under William Bennett.
<p>
Bauer notes, &quot;Every politician talks about supporting the
family, but when the election results are in and the rhetoric
dies down, different visions are in conflict. And every time,
America's families wonder why the people who sounded so good,
could make such bad policy. My book is a tool for deciphering
exactly what a politician means by 'pro-family policy.'
<p>
&quot;<b>Hillary Clinton says it takes a village to raise a child</b>,
but the real 'village' is founded on strong parents, supported
by family, friends, churches, schools and the local community.
Big government isn't a village. And bureaucrats in Washington,
D.C. are not better able to make decisions for children than loving
parents. The village must be an environment in which families
are supported and strengthened.
<p>
&quot;<b>The problem today <i>is</i> the village</b>. Cultural
pollution, crime, violence, liberal government policies, sexually
explicit images, unresponsive educators and anti-faith bigotry
are among the 'village forces' that work against families trying
to teach their children right from wrong and trying to give them
a sense of  the American dream.
<p>
&quot;<b>The dream is not the pursuit of money</b>, but it is
the hope that every person will have the opportunity to succeed
in a world that does not self-destruct, but has enduring values
that protect us and our families.&quot;
<p>
Published by Focus on the Family,<I> Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I>
is a valuable grassroots tool. You can order a copy by calling
1-800-225-4008. <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> will be available
Feb. 1 at your local Christian bookstore.
<p>
&quot;<b>Dr. James Dobson and I want to get this book to one
million readers in 1996</b>,&quot; Bauer noted, &quot;so that
every American will have a pro-family resource. At the end of
each chapter, Yes-or-No questions make it possible for people
to take the spin out of the rhetoric.
<p>
&quot;But the heart of the book is the 'Compact with Our Fellow
Americans,' a commitment for those who sign it  that we will work
together to heal America and make it the place of  our hopes and
dreams.&quot;

<center><h2>AFTER JUDGE WITHDRAWAL, U.S. APPEALS<br>
COURT SET TO HEAR ABEL CASE</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> After almost a month delay, <I>Abel
et. al, v. U.S.A. et. al</I>, one of the many cases involving homosexuals in 
the military, will be heard today in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second 
Circuit in New York City.  On Dec. 19, Judge Guido Calabresi recused himself
from the case because of a letter he had written in favor of a
more liberal position than the law at the time set out.  Today,
a new three judge panel will hear arguments about six service
members' discharges on the basis of admission of homosexuality.
 Family Research Council filed a friend of the court brief, written
by Melissa Wells-Petry, counsel for FRC's Military Readiness Project,
in the case.  Experts will be available for comment in New York.
<p>
The lower court ruled that Abel's six service members' First and
Fifth Amendment rights were violated when the military sought
to discharge them solely based on their admission of homosexuality.
 But as pointed out in the recent <I>Thomasson</I> hearings in
Richmond, Virginia, the military homosexual cases are about the
Clinton Administration's effort to make an end-run around Congress
by defending vague regulations rather than the 1993 law which
clearly excludes homosexuals from military service.
<p>
&quot;The Clinton Administration is doing all it can to put homosexuals
in the military,&quot; said Bob Maginnis, FRC Director of the
Military Readiness Project and a retired Army lieutenant colonel.
&quot;Congress passed the law excluding homosexuals serving in
the military in support of what the American people demanded,
but the Clinton Pentagon has subverted the law with bad implementing
regulations -- many say deliberately creating a legal quagmire.&quot;
<p>
Maginnis continued: &quot;The Clinton Administration wants the
law viewed through the prism of the bad regulations which create
two classes of homosexuals, those who have sex and those who don't.
 But the law presumes and the courts have long affirmed that a
homosexual is one who regularly engages in, or intends to engage
in, same sex activity. While some who struggle with homosexual
temptations may never act on them, there is no such thing as a
chaste homosexual,&quot; Maginnis said.
<p>
&quot;The pro-homosexual Clinton Justice Department has created
a constitutional thicket for the courts by adding to the law what
was never intended.  FRC's brief points out this thicket and calls
for the court to affirm the law and the Pentagon's discharge for
self-avowed homosexuals.&quot;
<p>
Because of <I>Abel's</I> delay, <I>Thomasson v. Perry</I>, another
case on this issue recently heard in the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Fourth Circuit, may reach the Supreme Court before <I>Abel</I>.
FRC presented oral arguments in <I>Thomasson</I> and may have
the opportunity to argue before the highest court in the land
one of the most controversial issues of our day.
<p>
<center><h4>Both Maginnis and Wells-Petry will be available for comment
at the hearing. They also can be reached by contacting the FRC
media office.</h4></center>

<center><h2>FRC APPLAUDS TELECOM BILL<br>
CYBERPORN LANGUAGE,<br>
SAYS LAW PROTECTS MINORS<br>
FROM A &quot;LOADED GUN&quot;</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council applauds the
Telecom Conference Committee's decision to include pornography
restrictions in the Telecommunications Bill.   &quot;Leaving pornography
unrestricted in cyberspace is like leaving a loaded gun in a playground.
The new language will help parents protect their children by making
cyberporn inaccessible by children,&quot; Director of Legal Studies
Cathy Cleaver said.
<p>
Highlights of the cyberporn provisions:
<p><ul>
<li>Use of court-approved &quot;indecency&quot; standard, defined
in the bill as an <B>&quot;image or other communication that,
in context, depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive
as measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory
activities or organs&quot;</B> 
<p>
<li>Indecent communications <B>restricted from children</B>, available
to adults
<p>
<li>People liable only for <B>knowing violations</B> of the law
<p>
<li>Online service providers not liable for violations beyond
areas they own or control
<p>
<li>E-mail privacy laws unchanged
<p>
<li>Those taking good faith efforts to restrict pornography from
children have a defense
</ul><p>
Cleaver noted that, contrary to much of the current rhetoric,
the cyberporn provisions will not find Shakespeare or any other
serious work of literature or library art to be indecent. &quot;Adults
with common sense do not confuse art and literature with patently
offensive materials which degrade women, corrupt children, and
ruin men,&quot; Cleaver said, &quot;and the courts will be obliged
to evaluate material in its proper context.&quot;
<p>
FRC's Assistant to the President for Government Relations Marty
Dannenfelser noted that a few other provisions of the bill are
still unresolved and urged the conferees and the Congressional
leadership to make every effort to conclude these matters as soon
as possible.
<p>
&quot;I hope that both the House and the Senate are able to give
final approval to this important legislation by the end of the
year, so that we do not risk losing the opportunity to protect
our children from the cultural poison of cyberporn,&quot; Dannenfelser
said.

<center><h2>NEW DIVORCE RATES RELEASED</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The national divorce rate is 4.6,
according to a compilation of new data released today by the Family
Research Council.  In 1994, 4.6 of every 1,000 Americans divorced.
<p>
Massachusetts and Connecticut rank 1st and 2nd, respectively,
for having the lowest divorce rates in the nation.  Both states
experienced a moderate drop in divorce rates between 1992 and
1994 to remain at the top of the list.  Massachusetts fell from
2.8 in 1992 to 2.4 in 1994, while Connecticut fell from 3.1 to
2.8.
<p>
Nevada once again had the highest divorce rate in the country,
even though it experienced the most marked drop in divorce rates
during the two-year period.  Nevada fell from 11.4 in 1992 to
9.0 in 1994.
<p>
Currently, divorce laws in almost every state give greater legal
rights to spouses who want to end the marriage than to spouses
who want to try to work out their marital problems. According
to FRC's 1995 Family Issues Survey, 55 percent of the American
public want to see these laws modified to offer greater protection
to spouses interested in saving the marriage.  &quot;Clearly divorce
reform is an issue that needs to be addressed at the state level,&quot;
said Gary L. Bauer, president of the Family Research Council.

<center><h2>NEW ILLEGITIMACY RATES RELEASED</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Thirty-one percent of all births in
the U.S. are to unmarried women, according to a compilation of
new data released today by the Family Research Council.
<p>
&quot;Most Americans believe preventing out-of-wedlock pregnancy
is a realistic goal,&quot; said FRC president Gary Bauer.  He
cited findings from FRC's 1995 Family Issues Survey showing that
most Americans actually have greater hope for illegitimacy prevention
programs than for workfare programs designed to move single mothers
off welfare.
<p>
In addition, FRC's poll showed that most Americans consider &quot;putting
the child up for adoption&quot; and &quot;marrying the child's
father&quot; to be better responses to an unwed pregnancy than
single motherhood.  A clear majority -- 55 percent -- say abortion
is the &quot;worst&quot; response to an unwed pregnancy, Bauer
said.
<p>
The state with the lowest percentage of births to unmarried women
is Utah, with 15.5 percent.  Like Utah, most other states with
low illegitimacy ratios are sparsely-populated states west of
the Mississippi River.  East of the Mississippi, only Vermont
and New Hampshire show a ratio of less than 25 percent of births
to unmarried women.  
<p>
Of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, 10 states have
illegitimacy ratios at or above 35 percent.  All of these states,
with the exception of New York, are along the southern rim of
the 48 contiguous states.

<center><h2>ABEL JUDGE PULLS OUT OF CASE<br>
GOOD NEWS FOR FAMILIES, SAYS FRC</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> When Family Research Council staff got to
the New York court on Tuesday where the <I>Abel et al v. William
Perry </I>was being heard, they were prepared to hear arguments
about six service members' discharges on the basis of admission
of homosexuality. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
in New York City was the next stop for the case which could go
on to the Supreme Court. 
<p>
However, at the last minute, Judge Guido Calabresi recused himself
from the case because of a letter he had written in favor of a
more liberal position than the law at the time set out. Court
watchers said that the judge pulled out after the Justice Department
reminded him of the letter. Since there were only two judges left
to hear the case, rather than the three needed, the hearing had
to be postponed.
<p>
&quot;This is very good news for pro-family Americans,&quot; FRC
Director of the Military Readiness Project Robert Maginnis said,
directly after the hearing. &quot;The New York court is not expected
to be as favorable to the view of most Americans, the law and
military experience -- the view that homosexuals should not be
allowed to serve in the military because of the problems their
presence cause.&quot;
<p>
&quot;Abel was one of two cases on this issue making its way toward
the Supreme Court. The other, <i>Thomasson v. Perry</i>, was heard
recently in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit,
and Family Research Council presented oral arguments. Now, Thomasson
may very well make it to the Supreme Court first, and Family Research
Council could argue before the highest court in the land one of
the most controversial issues of our day.
<p>
&quot;The Clinton Administration has not been making the case
that has traditionally fallen to the government -- the case for
a strong military force, free from a sexually charged environment.
It is critical that a fighting force be able to work as a team
without the complications of sexual politics.&quot;

<center><h2>ABEL CASE DOES END-RUN AROUND THE LAW,<br>
SET FOR TUESDAY HEARING IN NEW YORK</h2></center>
<p>
<b>Washington, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council, a national
leader in the battle opposing homosexuals in the military, filed
this summer a friend of the court brief in the <I>Abel et al v.
William Perry</I> federal case which is scheduled for arguments
on Dec. 19.  Either this case or the 4th Circuit's <I>Thomasson
v. Perry</I> case is expected to reach the Supreme Court next
year.  Family Research Council will be at the U.S. Court of Appeal
for the Second Circuit in New York City when the case will be
heard, and experts will be available for comment.
<p>
The lower court ruled that Abel's six service members' First and
Fifth Amendment rights were violated when the military sought
to discharge them solely based on their admission of homosexuality.
 But as pointed out in the recent Thomasson hearings in Richmond,
Virginia, the military homosexual cases are about the Clinton
Administration's effort to make an end-run around Congress by
defending vague regulations rather than the 1993 law which clearly
excludes homosexuals from military service.
<p>
&quot;The Clinton Administration is doing all it can to put homosexuals
in the military,&quot; said Bob Maginnis, FRC Director of the
Military Readiness Project and a retired Army lieutenant colonel
 &quot;Congress passed the law excluding homosexuals serving in
the military in support of what the American people demanded,
but the Clinton Pentagon has subverted the law with bad implementing
regulations -- many say deliberately creating a legal quagmire.&quot;
<p>
Maginnis continued: &quot;The Clinton Administration wants the
law viewed through the prism of the bad regulations which create
two classes of homosexuals, those who have sex and those who don't.
 But the law presumes and the courts have long affirmed that a
homosexual is one who regularly engages in, or intends to engage
in, same sex activity. While some who struggle with homosexual
temptations may never act on them, there is not such thing as
a chaste homosexual,&quot; Maginnis said. 
<p>
&quot;Feeling pulled to do something is not the defining issue.
A person who is tempted to shop lift when a clerk's back is turned
is not a thief. A thief is the person who acts on that temptation
or who enters the store looking for an opportunity to steal,&quot;
Maginnis said.
<p>
&quot;The pro-homosexual Clinton Justice Department has created
a constitutional thicket for the courts by adding to the law what
was never intended.  FRC's brief points out this thicket and calls
for the court to affirm the law and the Pentagon's discharge for
self-avowed homosexuals.&quot;
<p>
After the hearing, a ruling could be expected sometime between
March and May, Maginnis said. The brief was written by Melissa Wells-Petry, 
counsel for FRC's Military Readiness Project. 
<p>
<b>Both Maginnis and Wells-Petry will be available for comment
at the hearing. They also will be reachable by calling the FRC
media.</b>

<center><h2>CLINTON'S JUSTICE DEPARTMENT USES<br>
SUPREME COURT TO PROMOTE<br>
ANTI-FAMILY AGENDA</h2></center>
<p>
<b>Washington, D.C. --</b> Today, the Family Research Council
filed a friend of the court brief in the Supreme Court case of
<I> U.S. v. Commonwealth of Virginia</I> (the Virginia Military
Institute). FRC Policy Analyst Bob Maginnis noted that &quot;in
this case, the Clinton Administration is promoting a radical agenda
that would enact the goals of the failed Equal Rights Amendment
without a vote.&quot;   Oral arguments are set for January 17,
1996.
<p>
Clinton's Justice Department goes well beyond the issue of whether
single-sex public colleges should be legal.  According to the
government's brief, Clinton wants the high court to impose a &quot;strict
scrutiny&quot; test which would make all classifications by gender
very hard to defend legally.  With high court approval, this would
be a back door to the Equal Rights Amendment reviving old debates
about Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, homosexual marriage and unisex
bathrooms.
<p>
The brief was written by Melissa Wells-Petry, counsel to FRC's
Military Readiness Project.
<p>
&quot;Ironically, this case would strike its hardest blow on women's
institutions,&quot;  Wells-Petry said. &quot;Single-sex schools
for women number 87, compared to two all-male partially state-supported
schools. Educators working with both sexes have long appreciated
that for some girls and some boys, a single-sex education provides
unique benefits. We can include the First Lady and a quarter of
the female members of Congress among leading Americans who are
single-sex education alumni.&quot;
<p>
The government's Supreme Court brief states, &quot;The long history
of discrimination against women, the general irrelevance of sex
as a ground for official decision-making, and women's continuing
under representation in government, all support the application
of strict scrutiny here.&quot;   This ignores differences between
men and women which were cited in the VMI hearings and helped
defeat the ERA.
<p>
The Clinton Administration appealed the decision by the U.S. Court
of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit  which accepted Virginia's proposal
to offer a military-style alternative at Mary Baldwin College
in Stauton, Virginia.  The government claims that  the 1976 forced
integration of women at the service academies shows that &quot;the
admission of women into a rigorous, military-style educational
program does not impair any governmental interest in producing
military personnel, let alone 'citizen-soldiers.'&quot; 
<p>
&quot;Accepting this 'evidence' will seriously erode female combat
exemptions and may subject women to a future combat draft,&quot;
said Maginnis, a retired Army lieutenant colonel.
<p>
Drew Days, III, Clinton's solicitor general, argues &quot;that
strict scrutiny is, in fact, the correct constitutional standard
for evaluating differences in official treatment based on sex.&quot;
 Strict scrutiny applies to racial classifications challenged
under the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution.  It requires
the defendant to prove that any race-based classification is narrowly
tailored to achieve a compelling government objective.  But the
color of a person's skin and sex are different spheres.
<p>
Looking at legal precedents, Maginnis noted, &quot;A strict scrutiny
finding in this case could eliminate single-sex education, permit
homosexual adoption and marriage, prohibit single-gender sports
and even make single-sex prisons unconstitutional.&quot;

<h4>Family Research Council calls on Congress to support the Child

<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Fresh examination of the full
range of erroneous and fraudulent findings in the Kinsey research
is long overdue,&quot; Family Research Council Director of Cultural
Studies Robert H. Knight said Thursday in a news conference to
unveil the Child Protection and Ethics in Education Act of 1995.
Knight made his comments in the 11:30 a.m.  news conference at
2222 Rayburn as Rep. Steve Stockman (R-TX) presented the legislation.
<p>
Mr. Knight made the following statement:
<p>
&quot;Family Research Council commends Rep. Stockman  and the
approximately 40 cosponsors on the introduction of The Child Protection
and Ethics in Education Act of 1995, a bill designed to resolve
unanswered questions about the ethics and scientific integrity
of the sex studies by Alfred C. Kinsey in the 1940s and '50s.
 Despite the flaws identified by early critics of the Kinsey methodology 
and findings, the twin studies Kinsey's team authored,
on male and female sexuality, continue to provide a pseudo-intellectual
foundation for social change that has proven deeply injurious
to children and families.&quot;
<p>
&quot;The 1990 book <I>Kinsey, Sex and Fraud</I> by Judith Reisman,
Ph. D., and Edward Eichel, M.A. (Drs. Gordon Muir and John Court,
eds.) revealed a variety of serious problems with the Kinsey research.
 According to scientific fraud specialist Dr. Walter Stewart of
the National Research Council, evidence of these problems is 'compelling
. . . disturbing . . . and requires investigation.'  A review
of Kinsey, Sex and Fraud in the British medical journal The <I>Lancet</I>
concluded that the book 'demolish[es]' the foundations of the
Kinsey research, which The <I>Lancet</I> editors concluded was
'unethical [and] possibly criminal.&quot;
<p>
&quot;The<I> Lancet's</I> characterization of portions of the
research as 'possibly criminal' is based on the inclusion in the
male study of several tables compiled from information obtained
by 'nine' pedophiles.  Table 34 reports the results of orgasm
produced by adults in infants as young as a few months old.  The
current director of the Kinsey Institute, Dr. John Bancroft, now
says that there was but one pedophile engaged in this infant molestation,
but the Institute has refused to reveal his name, the names of
his child and infant victims, or anything else about the circumstances
under which this data was obtained and published.  These and other
key questions must be resolved now.&quot;
<p>
&quot;The introduction of The Child Protection and Ethics in Education
Act today takes a significant step forward in the effort to learn the full 
truth about the Kinsey research.  Given what we already know, it is unimaginable
that any reputable scientific study, any curriculum, or any public
policy today would be based on this work.  The American people
deserve a full accounting of the role that Kinsey played -- and
is still playing -- in molding the sexual ethics of our nation
and its children.&quot;

<p>
<h3>STOCKMAN BILL TO ADDRESS:</h3>
<p>
<h2>DOES DATA FROM MOLESTED<br>
CHILDREN SHAPE MOST SEX<br>
EDUCATION PROGRAMS?</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council will lend its
full support to the Child Protection and Ethics in Education Act
of 1995 to be announced by Rep. Steve Stockman (R-TX) in a news
conference <B>Thursday, Dec.7 at 11:30 a.m. in 2222 Rayburn</B>.
<p>
The bill's purpose is &quot;to determine if Alfred Kinsey's 'Sexual
Behavior in the Human Male' and/or 'Sexual Behavior in the Human
Female' are the result of any fraud or criminal wrongdoing.&quot;
 If such is found, the Congress will &quot;require an in-depth
study be performed to determine if Kinsey and his fellow researchers
employed systematic sexual abuse of children to obtain the data
tabulated in 'Table 34' and other portions of the study,&quot;
the bill states. 
<p>
The bill would also require the Government Accounting Office (GAO)
to study whether federal agencies and schools have used tax monies
to promote information on sexual behavior based upon &quot;erroneous,
fraudulent&quot; research.
<p>
FRC Director of Cultural Studies Bob Knight wrote and directed
a 30-minute documentary, &quot;The Children of Table 34,&quot;
investigating Kinsey's studies.
<p>
Knight said, &quot;After looking at the video, people are compelled
to ask, did the researchers lie about their findings, or were
children actually molested in the name of science?  It's a frightening
story, but it doesn't stop there. This research is central to
current thought on sex education for our children today.&quot;

<center><h2>STOP EFFORTS TO REPLACE MOM &amp; DAD<br>
WITH BIG BROTHER, CLEAVER SAYS</h2>
<p>
<h4>PARENTAL RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES ACT OF 1995 ON DECK<br>
AT 10 AM HEARING, DIRKSEN 226</h4></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> In the growing struggle of parents
versus the government in a war over who decides for America's
children, &quot;the need for federal legislation is becoming increasingly
apparent,&quot; said Cathy Cleaver, Director of Legal Studies
for Family Research Council, on Tuesday.
<p>
Miss Cleaver spoke on behalf of parents and in support of the
1995 Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act (H.R. 1946, S. 984).
During the 10 am hearing, Family Research Council applauded the
efforts of Senator Charles Grassley (R-IA) and  Rep. Steve Largent
(R-OK) in sponsoring the act because &quot;this is a good step
toward  restoring the rights of parents to direct the upbringing
and education of their children.&quot;
<p>
In support of parents, Miss Cleaver related the following:
<p>
&quot;Consider the following: this summer, Mr. and Mrs. Waymon
Earls of Georgia were shocked to find a bag of condoms in their
13- and 15-year old daughters' room.  After repeated inquiries
of the school superintendent, they found that a school counselor
had driven the girls during school hours to a health clinic where
they were tested for AIDS and cervical cancer, and given condoms
and prescriptions for birth control pills.  Mr. And Mrs. Earls
have not been allowed to see the results of their daughters' tests.
 This type of 'parenting' by agents of the state must stop.&quot;
<p>
&quot;Tragically, there are cases of abuse and neglect that the
government agencies must address.  This legislation continues
to allow the government to intervene when it has a compelling
interest to do so.&quot;
<p>
&quot;Stable, intact families rearing children with both love
and direction have never been in shorter supply or more desperately
needed. Let's stop replacing Mom and Dad with Big Brother, and
pass the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act.&quot;

<center><h2>FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL ARGUES TO<br>
UPHOLD 1993 LAW ON<br>
HOMOSEXUALS IN THE MILITARY</h2>
<p>
<h4><i>THOMASSON v. PERRY</i><br>
HEARD IN U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, 4TH CIRCUIT</h4></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council presents oral
arguments today in a landmark case in which the U.S. Court of
Appeals, 4th Circuit will consider the constitutionality of the
Clinton's Administration's homosexual policy as an interpretation
of the 1993 law passed by Congress excluding homosexuals from
military service. FRC Attorney Melissa Wells-Petry, former Army
lawyer who has litigated the military's ban on homosexuals for
years, submitted friend-of-the-court arguments to the effect that
the dismissal from the Navy of Lt-Paul G. Thomasson, a self-identified
homosexual, should be upheld.
<p>
Technically, FRC and the Clinton Justice Department will be on
the same side of this case, however their arguments differ greatly.
The Justice Department opposes FRC's arguments, based on the intent
of the law passed by Congress, and submitted a brief attacking
their participation.  The Justice Department rests their case
on, and as their brief states, has a &quot;paramount interest
in defending the validity of Directives&quot; issued to implement
the law.
<p>
Family Research Council analyst Lt. Col. Robert Maginnis says
the recent opposition  indicates that &quot;the Justice Department's
primary motive is to uphold Clinton's promise to the homosexual
community rather than to defend a law in the military's best interests.&quot;
<p>
&quot;We hope the court will declare the regulations unconstitutional
and sustain the law of the land,&quot; Maginnis said. &quot;It
would be a tremendous act on behalf of the men and women who put
their lives on the line for their nation daily. They deserve to
serve in an environment that does not put them in unnecessarily
intimate and intrusive circumstances.&quot; 
<p>
Maginnis anticipates the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals to refer
the case to the Supreme Court.

<h2>FRC TO PRESENT ARGUMENTS IN<br>
LANDMARK CASE, <I>THOMASSON v. PERRY</I></h2>
<p>
<h3>U.S. COURT OF APPEALS, 4TH CIRCUIT TO HEAR<br>
CASE ON HOMOSEXUALS IN THE MILITARY</h3></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> In a rare occasion, Family Research
Council will present arguments on why the 1993 law excluding homosexuals
from the military should be upheld during a Tuesday, December
5 hearing.  FRC Attorney Melissa Wells-Petry, a former Army attorney
who litigated the military's ban on homosexuals, will defend the
law in the landmark case of <I>Thomasson v. Perry</I> before the
U.S. Court of Appeals, 4th Circuit, in Richmond, Va.
<p>
FRC will be in the position of defending the law passed by Congress,
and the Clinton Administration's Justice Department will take
the more liberal position of building their case on the Department
of Defense regulations implemented to enact the law.
<p>
According to Family Research Council analyst Lt. Col. Robert Maginnis,
the confusion between the law and Clinton's &quot;Don't Ask/Don't
Tell&quot; policy is a strategy designed to lead to litigation.
<p>
&quot;Military people support the ban and so do the American people,&quot;
Maginnis said. 
<p>
A survey by the American Security Council Foundation found that
99% of active duty officers said homosexuals would undermine the
cohesiveness and readiness of combat units.

<h3>HOMOSEXUALS IN THE MILITARY CASE,<br>
<i>THOMASSON v. PERRY,</i> TO BE HEARD IN U.S.<br>
COURT OF APPEALS, 4TH CIRCUIT</h3>
<p>
<h2>FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL<br>
WILL PRESENT ARGUMENTS</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council Attorney Melissa
Wells-Petry will present arguments on why the 1993 law excluding
homosexuals from the military should be upheld during a Tuesday,
December 5 hearing. Wells-Petry, a former Army attorney who litigated
the military's ban on homosexuals, will defend the law in the
landmark case of <I>Thomasson v. Perry </I>before the U.S. Court
of Appeals, 4th Circuit, in Richmond, Va.
<p>
To the surprise of court watchers, the Appeals Court granted
FRC's request to address them -- despite the objections of the
Department of Justice and attorneys for Thomasson, a self-identified
homosexual serving in the military. Ironically, Family Research
Council will be in the position of actually defending the law
-- which would seem to be the province of the Justice Department.
However, the Clinton Administration's Justice Department has taken
the more liberal position of building their case on the regulations
implemented to enact the law.
<P>
According to Family Research Council analyst Robert Maginnis,
from the beginning of the &quot;Don't Ask/Don't Tell&quot; policy,
 the strategy of the Clinton Administration  has been to set up
a confusing situation between the law and the regulations.
<p>
<B>&quot;The confusion was designed to lead to ligitation,&quot;
Maginnis said.</B>
<p>
&quot;We hope the court will declare the regulations unconstitutional
and sustain the law of the land,&quot; Maginnis said. &quot;It
would be a tremendous act on behalf of the men and women who put

<h2>SENATE RESUMES DEBATE ON</br>
PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTION BILL</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> The U.S. Senate is expected to resume
debate on the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act (HR 1833) as early
as Monday, December 4.  Family Research Council supports the partial-birth
abortion ban and will oppose any weakening amendments to the bill.
<p>
The Senate voted November 7 to refer the bill to the Judiciary
committee for a public hearing. On November 17, the Senate Judiciary
Committee held a hearing to educate the Senators about this procedure.
 Senators heard dramatic testimony from a number of witnesses
including the President of the American Society of Anesthesiologists,
Dr. Ellison. Delivering key testimony, Ellison dispelled the claim
of an abortionist who testified last summer before a House subcommittee,
that anesthesia given to the mother as part of the procedure protects
the fetus from pain, and that it causes &quot;brain death&quot;
in the fetus. Others testifying about the procedure were former
abortion nurse Brenda Shafer, Dr. Pamela Smith, Dr. Nancy Romer,
Helen Alvare, Jeannie Wallace French, and Professor Douglas Kmiec.
No amendments were offered to the bill, and it automatically returned
to the Senate &quot;calendar&quot; November 28. 
<p>
As early as Monday, December 4th, Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole
(R-KS) and Senator Bob Smith (R-NH), the prime sponsor of the
bill, may take up the House-passed bill on the Senate floor. 
<p>
The House has already voted overwhelmingly on November 1 to pass
the bill by more than a 2-1 margin (288-139).  In the Senate,
it is expected that the bill will receive support from a diverse
group of senators with various histories on pro-life votes.  FRC
will be urging Senators to oppose a series of misleading amendments
designed to gut the substance of the legislation.

<center><h2>FEDERALLY-FUNDED &quot;SAFE SEX&quot;<br>
COMMERCIALS SEND WRONG MESSAGE<br>
TO TEENS</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council Policy Analyst
Gracie Hsu made the following statement in response to the new
&quot;safe sex&quot; public service announcements released today
by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS):
<p>
<B>Flawed premise</B> -- &quot;The Family Research Council (FRC)
finds the HHS ads irresponsible in that all the ads -- with the
exception of the abstinence ad -- begin with the flawed premise
that there is nothing wrong or harmful about teenagers having
sex as long as they use a condom.  The truth is, out-of-wedlock
sex is harmful in and of itself, regardless if a condom is used:
 broken hearts, emotional regret, and greatly increased likelihood
to divorce are just some of the consequences of pre-marital sex.&quot;
<p>
<B>Doomed for failure</B> -- &quot;These ads are doomed for failure.
 Research clearly shows that condom-based approaches actually
increase the likelihood that teenagers will initiate sex.  The
only approach that has proven to be effective in protecting young
people is abstinence.  The problem with these ads is that, when
they crash and burn, they'll likely take a whole host of young
people with them.&quot;
<p>
<B>Irresponsible use of federal funds</B> -- &quot;When public
opinion polls show that a majority of adults <b>and</b> teenagers
believe that it is best to save sex for marriage, it is irresponsible
for the federal government to be using taxpayer dollars to give
its imprimatur for teens to have sex.&quot;
<p>
<B>Undermines parents</B> -- &quot;The ads, clearly aimed at teenagers
and 'Generation X,' undermine what most parents want for their
children.  These ads undercut the message that most parents explicitly
or implicitly relate to their children that sex should be saved
until marriage.&quot;
<p>
<B>FRC's position</B> -- &quot;FRC is, and always has been, committed
to protecting young people from the negative consequences of early
sexual activity (i.e., out-of-wedlock pregnancy, abortion, AIDS,
and other sexually-transmitted diseases), and to promoting the
positive benefits of saving sex for marriage (i.e., more stable
marriages, greater sexual satisfaction, fewer infertility problems).
 FRC has been a leader in educating young people about the benefits
of abstinence and heartily endorses other efforts which help strengthen
the resolve of young people to wait until marriage to have sex.&quot;

<center><h2>FRC WILL FIGHT FOR MILITARY<br>
LAW IN FEDERAL COURT</h2></center>
<p>
<b>Washington, D.C. --</b> The Family Research Council will defend
the military's homosexual law before the 4th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals on December 5.   This rare privilege comes after extensive
FRC work in articulating a case about the real impacts of  the
radical homosexual agenda in the military.
<p>
Robert Maginnis, FRC's Military Readiness Project director and
a retired Army lieutenant colonel, announced on Tuesday that the
4th Circuit which sits in Richmond, Virginia, approved FRC's motion
to make oral arguments in the case of Navy Lt. Paul G. Thomasson.
 <b>This is the first challenge to President Clinton's &quot;don't
ask, don't tell&quot; policy expected to reach the Supreme Court
next year.</b>
<p>
Mr. Thomasson, who worked for the admiral administering &quot;don't
ask, don't tell,&quot; told his commander about his sexual orientation
days after the policy went into effect.  After the Navy moved
to discharge him, he challenged the policy in federal court and
lost.  
<p>
Melissa Wells-Petry, a former Army litigator and now representing
FRC, will argue that the White House and Pentagon failed to follow
a newly enacted law when writing the &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot;
policy.  The law, enacted by Congress and signed by President
Clinton, bars homosexuals from serving in the military.  But the
regulations allow homosexuals to serve as long as they keep their
orientation private.
<p>
Mrs. Wells-Petry explains, &quot;They're definitely trying to
do what I call 'the wink' in the regulations as opposed to a clear-cut
rule.  They're trying to put as a matter of policy, 'We're going
to wink at it until it becomes flagrant.'  In our view it's just
not a workable policy.&quot;
<p>
The Military Readiness Project has aggressively filed amicus briefs
in most homosexual military cases because, as Colonel Maginnis
says, &quot;The Clinton Administration is ignoring the law and
trying to erase centuries of prudent policy in favor of allowing
homosexuals to serve in the military.&quot; 
<p>
FRC's team will join a three-sided argument with the Justice Department
defending the regulations, Mr. Thomasson's attorney asking that
the law and the policy be ruled unconstitutional and the Military
Readiness Project defending the law.
<p>
In accepting FRC's motion for oral argument, the Court acknowledges
that there is &quot;extraordinary&quot; justification for a third
party to argue.  The extraordinary situation exists because neither
the government or Thomasson is addressing the right issue.

<center><h4>ANNOUNCING FRC'S NEW T.V. SHOW:</h4>
<p>
<h2><i>&quot;STRAIGHT TALK</i><br>
FROM THE FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL&quot;</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> Family Research Council this month
launched a new one hour television program called, &quot;Straight
Talk from the Family Research Council,&quot; on National Empowerment
Television (NET), a cable Political NewsTalk Network. Every Wednesday
at 8 p.m., the show airs cutting edge news stories, fast-paced
discussions and commentary by President Gary Bauer, Director of
Communications Kristi Hamrick, and guest appearances by FRC policy
analysts, members of Congress, and leaders of the pro-family movement.
<p>
The show includes many different segments, such as &quot;Behind
the Headlines,&quot; an insider's look at what is happening to
the family in Washington, and &quot;Homefront News,&quot; a highlight
of what FRC has been doing to bolster the family.
<p>
Each show tackles a single issue from many sides. Topics include:
what original FRC polling shows about Americans, welfare reform,
tainted sex research, and more. 
<p>
An exciting new venture for FRC, &quot;Straight Talk&quot; reaches
into more than 11 million homes. &quot;Our dream of providing
a pro-family voice is much bigger than merely building a conservative
'speed bump' in a vast terrain of liberal reporting,&quot; Gary
Bauer said. &quot;Our vision is to help a national audience understand
not only what we believe but why we support the kind of pro-family
reforms that we advocate daily in Washington. Our aim is to make
a connection with even more of those millions of Americans who
go to work every morning worrying about the kind of world their
children are inheriting.&quot;
<p>
To learn whether your cable company carries NET: Check local listings
or call your cable carrier. If you have a satellite dish, NET
can be reached on Galaxy 7, Transponder 20. <B>Beginning December
1st, NET will change settings to Galaxy 6, Transponder 7.</B>

<center><b>SENATE SENDS PARTIAL-BIRTH TO COMMITTEE:<br>
<font size=+2>IT'S A TIME FOR EDUCATION, SAYS BAUER<br>
<p>
<i>AND: MEDIA ADVISORY FOR THURSDAY HEARING.</i></font></b></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> &quot;Pro-family Americans support
the vote today because it allows more time to better educate the
Senators about this inhumane procedure,&quot; Family Research
Council President Gary Bauer said Wednesday after the Senators
voted to recommit the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act to the Senate
Judiciary Committee.  A hearing will be scheduled in committee
in the next nineteen days.
<p>
&quot;As we saw in the historic vote in the House, with members
on both side of the abortion issue voting for the ban, our representatives
acknowledged that there are limits to what can be done to the
unborn. A procedure that pulls a child into the birth canal so
that his or her brain tissue can be sucked out is blatantly unacceptable.&quot;
<p>
&quot;This ban will not affect women whose lives are in danger.
The bill is clear. And the additional time will allow the Senate
to fully consider what is being done to some children moments
before birth.&quot;
<p>
<b>MEDIA ADVISORY: FRC Director of Cultural Studies Robert Knight
will testify 9:30 a.m. Thursday before the Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee, SD-342. TOPIC: The Family Privacy Act. The
bill would require the approval of at least one parent before
a minor could respond to surveys or questionnaires from federally
funded programs.</b>

<center><h2>FRC TESTIFIES IN FAVOR OF A<br>
RELIGIOUS LIBERTY AMENDMENT</h2>
<p>
<b>HEARING AT 10 A.M. IN SENATE DIRKSEN - ROOM 226</b></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> At a hearing today in the Senate Judiciary
Committee, Family Research Council Director of Legal Studies Cathy
Cleaver said the following in favor of a religious liberty amendment
to the Constitution:
<p>
&quot;The Religious Liberty Amendment could be thought of as the
religious 'neutrality' amendment.  This principle of neutrality
is not new -- it is the aim and result of our First Amendment's
religion clauses properly understood.  A Religious Liberty Amendment
could restore this saving principle, so that our First Amendment
would not be used to promote the empty state religion of secularism,
but to promote true freedom, and the prospect of freedom's fulfillment
in truth, to which every American is entitled.&quot;

<p>
<h2>KINSEY SEX STUDIES ARE TOPIC OF<br>
FOCUS ON THE FAMILY BROADCAST</h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C. --</b> On Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday
of this week, &quot;Focus on the Family,&quot; a radio show reaching
over one million listeners with Dr. Dobson and guest Robert Knight,
Family Research Council Director of Cultural Studies, will discuss,
&quot;What happened to children in the sex studies conducted at
the Kinsey Institute on Indiana University's campus in the 1940's?&quot;
<p>
<I>The Children of Table 34, </I>a video that FRC released this
fall after three years of research and production, prompted the
broadcast. This video investigates the circumstances and people
involved in collecting the data that is revealed in Alfred C.
Kinsey's reports in 1948, <I>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male
</I>and in 1953, <I>Sexual Behavior in the Human Female</I>. 
<p>
FRC has repeated attempts to confront the Kinsey Institute with
questions regarding this study.  Recent controversies surrounding
the study include the Institute's claim that the data gathered
for this report originated from one anonymous man. 
<p>
Knight, who wrote and directed FRC's video, said, &quot;Kinsey's
sex studies have been used as the scientific basis to justify
everything from condom distribution in schools to teaching children
how to masturbate. If indeed this influential data was gathered
by one man who molested children ages two months and up, something
must be done by the new Congress to examine this horrific, scientific
experiment and to change the course of sex education as we know
it today.&quot;

<center><h2><i>ROMER V. EVANS</i>: THE IMPACT OF A CLINTON PRESIDENCY?</h2></center>
<p>
<B>WASHINGTON, D.C.</b> -- &quot;Today, pro-family Americans saw
a powerful repercussion of the Clinton Presidency,&quot; Family
Research Council attorney Melissa Wells-Petry said Tuesday, following
oral arguments in the homosexual related case <I>Romer v. Evans</I>.
&quot;Justices Ginsberg and Breyer, Clinton appointees,  led the
charge against the people of Colorado in the Supreme Court hearing
on the contentious Amendment 2 case.&quot;
<P>
Wells-Petry filed a &quot;friend-of-the-court&quot; brief on behalf
of Family Research Council and attended the oral arguments. Her
involvement follows on the heels of FRC Director of Communications
Robert Knight who testified at the trial court level on behalf
of the people of Colorado's right to make a democratically agreed
upon statement about homosexuality.
<P>
In the brief before the Supreme Court, Wells-Petry argued that
to throw out Amendment 2 and overthrow the people of Colorado's
decision was to cut off democratic options, such as legal referendum,
and make homosexuality the law of the land. 
<P>
The Clinton administration appointees were clearly aggressive
in their questioning of the   people of Colorado, Wells-Petry
noted. She made the following statement:
<P>
&quot;The Clinton appointees used 80% of the air time during the
one-hour hearing.  They sat in super judgment of the people of
 Colorado, apparently undisturbed at the prospect of substituting
their judgment for that of the over 1,524,000 Colorodans who exercised
their constitutional right to vote on this issue.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Moreover, these two justices in particular seemed completely
unconcerned about the implications, both for the law and society,
of 'discovering' a new fundamental right that obviously was created
to award homosexuals special rights even though homosexuality
does not fall under established legal analyses of classes requiring
special protection.  In fact, in this very case the lower court
held that homosexuals are not a suspect class.&quot;
<P>
&quot;In short, during oral arguments before the high court, little
was said about the bizarre impact this case could have on the
democratic process.&quot;
<P>
&quot;We have seen the future of a Clinton court,&quot; Wells-Petry
said. &quot;This is another wake up call on the implications of
the presidency. How many justices will be nominated by the next
president?  It's time for a national conversation on whether Americans
want the right to vote on the laws of the land, or to allow liberal
judges to overrule democratic decisions.&quot;

<i><font size=6><b>ROMER v. EVANS</font></i><br>
<font size=5>&quot;The Case of the Decade&quot;</font></b>
<p>
<h2>MORAL IMPLICATIONS OF SUPREME COURT<br>
DECISION WOULD RESEMBLE <i>ROE v. WADE</i></h2></center>
<p>
<b>WASHINGTON, D.C.</b> -- When the U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments
for <I>Romer v. Evans </I>on October 10, it could be a historical
moment, as sweeping as <I>Roe v. Wade</I>.   Attorney Melissa
Wells-Petry, a former Army major and author of <i>Exclusion: Homosexuals
and The Right To Serve</i>, has submitted a &quot;friend of the
court&quot; brief, and has noted that this decision mirrors <I>Roe
v. Wade</I> in that &quot;it would present the same risk for public
policy disaster by foreclosing political choice.&quot; 
<p>
When the court in Colorado struck down Amendment 2, it said that
homosexuality cannot be the subject of negative public regulation,
even regulation by omission.  
<p>
In her brief, Wells-Petry said that such a decision from the U.S.
Supreme Court would provide homosexuals with &quot;'easy money'
-- a new constitutional right -- with which to buy a result they
did not earn in the marketplace of ideas. This new right allows
homosexuals to circumvent the process of obtaining a consensus
for their ideas in that marketplace of ideas. It allows homosexuals
to insulate their ideas from that market's ebb and flow.  Indeed,
no matter what ideas homosexuals advance, people never can use
the ballot box affirmatively to reject those ideas.&quot; 
<p>
Wells-Petry warned the court that such a &quot;tremendous change
in the functioning of our democracy&quot; would have as severe
an impact on society as did <I>Roe</I>. &quot;The social, political,
and jurisprudential ramifications of the judicial overreaching
of <I>Roe</I> must not be repeated through the creation of a new
fundamental right in <I>Romer,</I>&quot; Wells-Petry stated.
<p>
FRC Director of Cultural Studies Robert H. Knight testified at
the trial in Colorado and said that a gay rights ordinance violates
the free speech clause of the First Amendment of the Constitution.
 The implications of this decision would be felt across society.
FRC  Policy Analyst retired Army Lt. Col. Robert L. Maginnis stated
that this decision would even affect the military and its policy.

America's foremost family advocate, Dr. James Dobson, and former White House domestic policy adviser Gary Bauer team up in this analysis of the "civil war over values" in contemporary culture.  With candor matched by conviction, Dobson and Bauer describe the challenges parents face raising children in today's moral wilderness.  Each author brings to the book his special expertise:  Dobson as psychologist and author, Bauer as public policy expert and longtime observer of the Washington political scene.  They discuss the sexual revolution, declining respect for human life, the campaign to redefine the family, Washington's failure to defend hearth and home, and much more.

<p>

While you and I were enjoying our Thanksgiving turkey, a
judge in California was busy putting Proposition 209 on the chopping
block.  Through Prop. 209, California voters dismantled the state's
system of racial preferences in hiring and college admissions.
The judge issued what's called a &quot;temporary restraining
order,&quot; keeping the racial spoils system in place for now.
He claimed that Prop. 209 probably violates the 14th amendment's
guarantee of equal protection.  But that's exactly what Prop.
209 <i>does</i> guarantee:  equal protection for all citizens
regardless of race or gender.

<p>

Now whatever you think of affirmative action itself, this
case is yet another example of judicial tyranny.  In Colorado,
it was a ban on special rights for homosexuals.  In Washington
state, a law against assisted suicide.  In each case, the courts
overturned the will of the people on a hotly contested issue.
The real question we must ask is:  how can self-government survive
as our courts shrink our liberty?  To answer that question is
to determine the fate of our republic.

<p>

After months of delay, Hollywood's television executives
have come up with a plan to protect your children from sex and
violence on the tube.  But don't celebrate yet..  Because, unfortunately,
the only thing it will protect is the big-time producers' ratings.

<p>

In essence, what Hollywood proposes is something like the
current movie rating system.  Each television show would carry
a simple code pegged to the age of the viewer that Hollywood considers
appropriate for each program.  Well!  I'm not impressed.  I just
don't trust Hollywood's opinion of its own product.  Most parents
want to know what a program actually contains.  Does it include
profanity?  Violence or nudity?  Homosexual characters and themes?
Parents want this information before they sit down to watch,
or let their children watch, a program.

<p>

Last spring, President Clinton met with television executives
to encourage them to come up with a system to safeguard families.
After so many months, Hollywood has responded with a dud.  This
is one premiere that deserves a swift cancellation.

<p>

The year's not over yet, but here's my award for most cynical:
Those liberals in Congress and out who denounced the Defense of
Marriage Act.  &quot;It's years away,&quot; they said of homosexual
marriage. &quot;Nobody's legalizing this,&quot; they said.  Conservatives
are &quot;jumping the gun,&quot; they charged.

<p>

Guess what. Hawaii's Supreme Court has just ruled that gay marriage
is legal in the Aloha State.  Pro-gay Bill Clinton has been safely
re-elected.  And the same people who denounced the Defense of
Marriage Act have forgotten everything they said just a few months
ago.  Then, Clinton's spokeswoman said he &quot;scorned&quot;
the Defense of Marriage bill -- even as he signed it. And the
press sure scorned it.

<p>

But events in Hawaii prove how timely, how important, how <I>needed</I> 
the Defense of Marriage Act was.  This fight is not over.
We will not give in.  The overwhelming majority of people in
America -- and in Hawaii itself -- <I>oppose</I> homosexual marriage.
The more people find out about it, the more strongly they want
to defend true marriage. Remember, what the radical homosexuals
really want is not marriage for them, but the <I>end</I> of marriage
for everyone.

<p>

The December chill has set in around the city of Washington.
With Congress out of town and President Clinton embarking on
a second term, the news hereabouts would typically be dominated
by the White House.  But it's been strangely silent at 1600 Pennsylvania
Ave.  Maybe it's the President's bad case of laryngitis although
most people who know Bill Clinton say not even that can keep him
from talking.

<p>

Just think: a month ago, as the Presidential campaign was
in high gear, the White House was reportedly simmering with ideas.
There were new proposals every day to counter education decline
and domestic abuse.  With all of that energy and excitement, staffing
the President's Cabinet should be easy.  But instead the President
only in the last 24 hours has been able to make appointments of
new officials to take us across that bridge to the 21st century.

<p>

Maybe the White House will shake off these December doldrums,
but it may also be that Bill Clinton is undergoing the curse of
the second term.  During this century, second terms have been
notoriously full of failure, indecision and scandal. Will that
be Bill Clinton's fate, too?  Only time will tell.

<p>

Honor. It's the missing word in modern English.  Honor is
a respect for norms, for history and tradition.  Honor is courage
fused with a deep humility.  Above all, honor is profound honesty.

<p>

But honor today is in trouble.  Just how much trouble is
obvious in a news report about the Congressional Medal of Honor.
It seems that the company that manufactures this prized award
has been doing a little business on the side.  It has been selling
duplicate copies of the medal to whoever is willing to pay.  You
heard me right.  For seventy-five dollars, you're a Congressional
Medal of Honor winner. The Congressional Medal of Honor is rarely
given.  Only the most unusual acts of bravery and self-sacrifice
-- extraordinary valor they call it -- qualify.  The Medal is
sometimes given to a grieving widow, parents pierced to the heart,
a now fatherless child.  None of these things has a commercial
price.

<p>

Once in a while an event comes along that captures vividly
how far we've fallen.  The case of the bogus medals is one of
those events.  America needs to recover its sense of honor.

I'm Gary Bauer for Washington Watch.

<p>

This week, more disturbing news was unveiled about the problem
called Gulf War Syndrome.  If you haven't been following this
story in detail, it involves nearly one hundred thousand American
veterans of the war against Saddam Hussein.  These veterans are
experiencing a wide variety of ailments, including birth defects
among their children, and a dispute is raging over whether exposure
to Iraqi chemical weapons is to blame.  For six years now, our
government has dragged its feet about getting to the bottom of
this.  The latest word is that key documents central to this investigation
are missing.

<p>

I'm neither a military nor medical expert, but foot-dragging
and ineptitude on matters like this are unacceptable.  The Pentagon
should be seeking answers to the nagging questions about Gulf
War Syndrome with the same vigor that it prosecuted the fight
against Iraq.  These young men, and now women, who answered their
country's call were heroes and heroines overseas.  Now our government
is acting like they are only hypochondriacs.  They deserve better
-- much better.

<p>

You probably haven't heard of the basketball team from Mount
Zion Christian Academy in Durham, North Carolina, but chances
are you'll soon hear a lot about them.  Many sportswriters and
scouts are calling them possibly the best high school team ever
assembled.

<p>

That in itself is interesting, but this team of athletic
stars is &quot;best&quot; in another and deeper sense, too.  They
are a nucleus of young men brought together as much on the basis
of their dismal past as their bright future.  This Christian school,
led by Pastor Donald Fozard, committed itself long ago to using
basketball to reach boys' souls.  The kids Fozard has taken in
are a motley crew of ex drop-outs, &quot;fall-through-the cracks&quot;
young men.  At Mt. Zion, they experience school as a disciplined
environment.  There are runs at five in the morning, mandatory
church twice-a-week, team prayers.  They are not allowed to date,
swear, listen to rap music, or wear jewelry.

<p>

The focus at Mt. Zion is on character and on the long-term
future -- on right and wrong and on faith.  And that focus is
taking Mt. Zion straight to the top.

<p>

American families want to trust their government in matters
great and small, but sometimes it isn't easy.  As we found with
the recent controversy over air bags, federal officials knew more
about the hazards of these devices than they were willing to tell
us -- supposedly for our own good.  The same goes for Gulf War
syndrome -- the possible exposure of our Desert Storm soldiers
to chemical weapons.

<p>

There was shocking testimony on Capitol Hill this week. 
It now seems clear that military commanders failed to pursue findings
by their own trained personnel that chemical weapon exposure had
taken place.  The British defense ministry has now publicly apologized
for its failure to follow through on the issue too.

<p>

These incidents have a common thread -- a national nanny
government that thinks it must shape and limit what the people
know.  Maybe you've had a similar experience with public officials
-- with the IRS, or with some environmental rule.  Practices like
these create an unhealthy gap between citizen and government.
That just isn't America -- here you have to earn your trust.

<p>

He has been christened the &quot;butcher of Tienanmen Square,&quot;
and he visited Washington this week, where he was received with
full military honors.  The communist general I am referring to
is China's Minister of Defense --  the same man, the very same
man, who ordered Red Army Troops to crush the unarmed student
protest that captured the world's attention in 1989.  He was invited
to the United States by President Clinton, who came into office
campaigning for human-rights and who has reduced U.S. policy in
Asia to one vast trade mission.

<p>

While the general was getting the red-carpet treatment, the
European Parliament was giving its major human rights award, the
Sakharov prize, to a jailed Chinese dissident, Wei Jing-Sheng.
Mr. Wei's sister received the award on his behalf.  She used
the occasion to remind us that we have betrayed our principles.
We are supporting &quot;a gang of tyrants&quot; in Beijing, she
declared, because we are focused narrowly on &quot;the great Chinese
market of the future.&quot;

<p>

American policy now betrays American ideals.  This was a
week of shame in Washington.

<p>

Bill Clinton has gone on the warpath again, this time taking
aim at talk radio.  Appearing on a popular talk show, Clinton
denounced talk radio as &quot;overwhelmingly right wing,&quot;
and said it doesn't serve the country well.  Well, I'll concede
one point.  Talk radio can sometimes be crass and crude.  Some
hosts believe you have to offend to get an audience.

<p>

But someone needs to remind the president of something. 
It takes gall to denounce one of the few unstructured forums in
this country for political speech.  Like most politicians, Clinton
ran a tightly controlled, carefully scripted campaign this year.
Talk radio, on the other hand, at least reflects some genuine
give-and-take among average Americans.  Own a phone and you can
be part of the conversation.

<p>

America is a land of freedom, and millions of men and women
have shed blood to keep it that way.  The last thing today's citizens
want or need is a lecture from the just re-elected president of
the United States that their views shouldn't be aired.  After
all, isn't having our say the American way?

Outside the White House press room, there is a gallery of
famous drawings by Norman Rockwell.  Rockwell portrayed reporters
as a classic group of working stiffs, lovable Joe's just waiting
for the right story to come along.  Just how far that image of
the press has faded from the public mind is obvious in a new Harris
Poll.

<p>

By large margins, the poll found, Americans believe reporters
are, get your paper and pencil ready, politically biased, obnoxious,
negative, sensational, and inaccurate.  And if that isn't enough,
the public also believes that reporters have too much influence,
ignore people's privacy, overlook their own errors, show too much
violence, and don't much care about people.  This is hardly good
news for our free press.  The public has about as much faith in
them as it would in Attila the Hun.

<p>

And the Harris Poll also had some hot tips for reporters.
By similar majorities, Americans want the media to root out corruption
in office and to protect the public from abuses of power.  In
short, to be good citizens first.  Now it seems to me that isn't
too much to ask.

Today is Christmas Eve, and across the country airports and
highways are jammed.  People are heading home for the holidays,
hoping to make it in time for Christmas.  But today there are
tens of thousands of Americans who can only dream of those airports
and highways -- of those homecomings that matter so much.

<p>

Those are the men and women of our Armed Forces.  America
may be at peace, but still there are an incredible 237,000 American
soldiers scattered across the globe.  We're all aware of the contingent
in Bosnia, but the majority of our sons and daughters overseas
are elsewhere.  They are serving with NATO, manning submarines
under polar ice, sweating as military attaches in Africa, or guarding
the truce line in Korea.

<p>

We are not at war, but none of these soldiers serve in safety.
As the publisher of the <I>American Legion Magazine</I> pointed
out recently, the great irony is that the very status of our forces
as emissaries of peace makes them targets of war.  To these men
and women, we say, &quot;Merry Christmas, and may God bless you
and your families.&quot;

<p>

On Christmas Day, we celebrate what might be called the &quot;mundane
miracle.&quot;  It was the most ordinary of events:  the birth
of a baby.  But it was the most impossible of miracles, too: 
the incarnation of God Himself.

<p>

The birth of that baby split human history in two.  Nothing
will ever be the same on this earth.  On an infinitely smaller
scale, the birth of any baby has the same effect on human habits.
Having a child changes us.  Suddenly, the carefree single becomes
caregiving father or mother.  Issues that didn't matter before
suddenly matter a lot --- from personal safety, to what's on TV,
to pornography -- right on down to regular mealtimes.

<p>

Such is the power of a baby.  But today, as more and more
of us turn our back on the child born in Bethlehem, our backs
are turned on other babies, too.  Babies slain in the womb or
left in dumpsters with the other debris of our too-fast times.
How foolish we are to reject new life -- for what is Christmas,
but the eternal promise of new life in Christ?

<p>

For the Family Research Council, this is Gary Bauer with
the today's Washington Watch.  For more information about us,

<p>

The newspapers have been filled lately with all sorts of
stories about questionable political contributions from Asian
sources to President Clinton's reelection and legal defense funds.
The stories raise major issues that go to the integrity of our
political system, and they should be thoroughly investigated.
Unfortunately, there's a danger in all of this that Asian-Americans
as a whole will be falsely stigmatized.

<p>

That makes the story of Kingston Technology even more important.
John Tu and David Sun are business partners who lost $2,000,000
in the 1987 stock market plunge.  Tu is a Chinese immigrant. 
Rather than despair, he and Sun restarted their California-based
business with just $4,000.  Through hard work and ingenuity, they
rebuilt their company and turned it into an American success story.
They just sold the company for $1.5 billion.  And get this, they
are giving their employees an average bonus of $75,000.

<p>

That's some Christmas present -- and it's an even more poignant
reminder that it's not race, but ethics that count.

Have you heard the news out of Oakland, California?  In that
city, the school board has done something truly idiotic.  They
decided to designate the language of certain minority students
as a foreign language.  The term for this language is &quot;Ebonics,&quot;
but in fact Ebonics is nothing more than English spoken poorly.

<p>

By getting the language patterns of these urban kids established
as a foreign tongue, the school board hoped to take advantage
of bilingual education money.  You heard me right.  Naturally,
the school board's action caused a firestorm.  It's tempting to
joke that all of this is merely a semantic dispute.  These young
kids obviously need help in learning to speak, read, and write
standard English, so who cares where the money comes from?  But
something deeper is at work here.

<p>

This issue really concerns false presumptions about who can
learn.  The Oakland school board is selling its own black students
short.  By doing so, it is limiting their horizons and their job
prospects.  The word for that is &quot;sad&quot; -- in any language.

<p>

I get caught up in holiday shopping as much as anyone, and
I have the bills to prove it.  So naturally my talk today is about
how we make too much of material goods during this spiritual season.
But I have special reason to emphasize that theme.

<p>

Just before Christmas, we received one of those calls in
the night every parent dreads.  The phone rang with the news that
our daughters, Elyse and Sarah, had been in an accident on the
interstate 75 miles from our home.  They were returning from Elyse's
college, and it was a night of sleet and slick roads.  The car
had spun across the highway and been rear-ended. The car was
totaled, but fortunately, both girls' injuries were minor -- a
bad head bump and some whiplash.  But it came home quickly to
us how easily our girls could have been killed on that highway
home.

<p>

The heart of Christmas is the miracle of the child Jesus,
God becoming man.  That miracle was even more meaningful this
year at the Bauer house, all because of what did -- and didn't
-- happen on a dark and icy road.

<p>

During his presidency, Bill Clinton's Secret Service detail
has had a sometimes-stormy relationship with the public.  The
latest incident occurred at the National Cathedral on Christmas
Eve.

<p>

The Rev. Bob Schenck got close enough to Clinton to whisper,
&quot;God will hold you to account, Mr. President.&quot;  According
to Schenck, Clinton heard the remark and understood it as Schenck
meant it -- a reference to the Presidential veto of the partial-birth
abortion ban.  In any event, when the service was over, Secret
Service agents detained Schenck, rifling through his wallet. 
They denied him a lawyer, and told him Clinton had complained
about Schenck's words.

<p>

As I noted, this isn't the first time Secret Service agents
have made life unpleasant for people who dare speak to Clinton.
What Schenck reportedly said is hardly a threat.  In fact, every
one of us will be held accountable by God -- for what we've done,
or failed to do, to show mercy, or kindness, or love.  And on
that day of judgment, none of us will have Secret Service agents
at our side to shield us from the truth.

<p>

I'm a bit old-fashioned, so every New Year's I make resolutions.
Some are personal -- like remembering to walk the dog before
I turn in for the night.  But others are public.  Here at the
Family Reserch Council, we've made several resolutions for the
New Year.

<p>

First, we're resolved to make 1997 the year of pro-family
tax relief.  Family tax cuts are one of those things that everybody
supports, but nobody enacts.  It's time this nation invested as
much in human capital as it does in physical capital.  Second,
we're resolved to make 1997 a year of national awakening about
the need for judicial reform.  With pending  issues like assisted
suicide and same-sex marriage, there's no time to lose in restoring
legislative power to the American people.  Third, we're resolved
to launch a new youth program, that will help train the next generation
of young men and women in the Judeo-Christian world view.

<p>

Finally, we resolve to seek these goals with an attitude
of prayerful humility.  As we reach out to the better angels of
our neighbors, we must first renew our own better angels.

When a set of indicators is headed in one direction, while
a related indicator is headed the other way, society must take
notice.  That's the case today in the area of drug-related arrests
among juveniles.  Overall, the national crime rate is declining.
But arrests of young people for drug possession are soaring.
Just one example.  In Fairfax County, Virginia, where I live,
the arrest rate for juvenile drug possession has increased <I>sevenfold</I>
since 1991.

<p>

That number is appalling, not just for what it says about
drug use, but also about the conditions in which drug use thrives.
Police now estimate that there are roughly 25,000 gangs operating
in the United States.  All told, these gangs have 652,000 members.
They typically commit all sorts of crimes, but the drug trade
remains a keystone business for most of them.

<p>

Thomas Constantine, head of the federal Drug Enforcement
Administration, calls this situation &quot;a ticking time bomb.&quot;
I agree.  You and I -- and every citizen -- must re-enlist in
the war against drugs.  If we fail, that bomb will go off in a
crowd of our children.

<center><h1>Daily Commentary<br>
January 6, 1997</h1></center>

<p><hr width=75% size=3><p>

I'm Gary Bauer for Washington Watch.

<p>

Now here's some good news from America's inner city.  Picture
this.  In Baltimore, fifty-eight young boys arrive for school
at 7:15 am.  It's cold and dark outside.  But inside, the boys
get a warm greeting from a Catholic priest and the 31-year old
headmaster at Ignatius Academy.  Each boy shakes hands with the
two men.  It is a civilized ritual.  If their pronunciation is
wrong, it is corrected, but no one is demeaned.  Most of the fifty-eight
boys are black, a few are white or Hispanic.  Only eighteen are
Catholic.  But each boy knows he is a child of God.

<p>

The school operates on the assumption that it makes a 
difference when young children are taught
that Jesus loves them.  It costs five thousand dollars a year
to educate each boy, but that's far less than Baltimore spends
on its public school students.  Generous donors provide scholarships
for the boys and each boy writes a personal thank-you letter,
because they should.  There are no metal detectors here.

<p>

The donors, the parents and the teachers at this school are saving
Baltimore, one soul at a time.  I pray that 1997 will give us
more stories like this academy.

<h3><i>WHICH TAX REFORM PLAN IS BEST FOR AMERICA?</i></h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/mitchell.htm">Daniel J. Mitchell</a><br> 
McKenna Senior Fellow in Political Economy <br>

Backgrounder No. 1055<br>
September 26, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>

	Tax reform is gaining momentum. Lawmakers from both parties are proposing sweeping changes in the income tax system, such as the Armey-Shelby flat tax (the most widely known of the proposed reforms), a national sales tax, the Nunn-Domenici USA tax, the Gephardt 10 percent tax, and a value-added tax.1 Almost every Republican presidential candidate endorses some form of radical tax reform, and House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-GA) and Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-KS) asked former Congressman and housing secretary Jack Kemp to chair a commission to recommend how best to reform the tax code. 
<p>
	 Each of the tax reform proposals assumes that the existing income tax system is fundamentally broken and cannot be fixed without a complete overhaul. But they achieve this in significantly different ways. The question is, which approach would be best for taxpayers and the economy?
<p>
<b>TAXPAYERS AND THE ECONOMY</b>
Grading Tax Reform Proposals<br>
<p>
Armey/Shelby flat tax  <b>A</b>
<p>
Specter flat tax   <b>A-</b>
<p>
Value-added tax*  <b>B+</b>
<p>
National sales tax*  <b>B</b>
<p>
Nunn-Domenici USA tax  <b>C+</b>
<p>
Gephardt 10 percent tax  <b>C</b>
<p>
*Grade contingent on permanent repeal of the current federal income tax
<p>

	When evaluated based on nine different criteria, including the degree to which they lower tax rates, simplify the system, address the bias against savings and investment, and treat taxpayers fairly, the plans based on the flat tax model developed by Stanford University Professor Robert Hall and Hoover Institution Senior Fellow Alvin Rabushka score highest.2 Direct consumption taxes also fare well, but proposals that more closely resemble the current system are graded the lowest. <p>	 Since no tax system is perfect, this grading scale is somewhat subjective:  A for reform as close to the ideal as possible,3 B for significant improvement over the current system, C for no significant effect one way or the other, D for a plan (or a feature of a plan) demonstrably worse than today's tax code, and F for significantly worse than today's tax code.<p>	In order to understand these grades, it is necessary to identify what is wrong with the current system and then to determine how each reform plan addresses each of these flaws.<p><b>WHAT IS WRONG WITH THE CURRENT SYSTEM</b><p>	Today's tax code has few defenders. Former Internal Revenue Service Commissioner Shirley Peterson states that there is nothing logical about the way the code is constructed now.4 As House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt points out: <p><blockquote>	 It has become a test of legal brainpower, an accountant's decathlon, a treasure hunt for hidden deductions and buried tax breaks. Our tax code has become a dense fog of incentives, inducements, and penalties that distort the most basic economic decisions, constrain the free market, and make it hard for Americans to run their own lives. The Internal Revenue Service has become a symbol of what is wrong with American government.5</blockquote><P>	And Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole has summed up many of the problems with the current system, noting:<p><blockquote>	During much of the past century, tax policy has been a primary tool with which government has wielded power, fed the bureaucracy, an
d redistributed wealth.... Any fair system would not penalize, but instead reward people for working harder, investing wisely, and saving more. It would eliminate the lobbyist-drafted loopholes that benefit the few, but force the rest of us to pay.6</blockquote><p>	The current income tax system is both anti-growth and discriminatory. Its problems, while seemingly endless, fall into several broad categories:<p><b>High tax rates</b> -- Under present law, a successful entrepreneur will pay more than 40 cents of each additional dollar earned to the federal government. This burden can rise to over 50 cents when state income taxes are included and to more than 80 cents when estate taxes are added. These excessive rates penalize productive economic behavior and reduce incentives to work, create wealth, and take risks.
<p>
<b>Complexity</b> -- The large number of forms, regulations, and rulings forces many Americans to pay professionals to fill out their tax forms. According to the Tax Foundation, annual compliance costs total nearly $200 billion (in addition to the taxes paid to Washington and the loss in economic growth caused by excessive rates).7<p><b>Multiple taxation</b> -- Some forms of income, particularly from savings and investment, are subject to as many as four levels of tax. For example, a dollar of capital income could be subject to corporate income, personal income, capital gains, and estate taxes. This combined burden becomes confiscatory and undermines incentives to save and invest.<p><b>Social engineering</b>  -- Politicians have turned the tax code into a bewildering system of special preferences, penalties, and deductions. Some income is taxed more than once, while other income is not taxed at all. Such complexity is inevitable in a tax system that rewards those with expensive lawyers and accountants and allows lawmakers to micromanage the economy while collecting large campaign contributions from donors seeking to change or preserve sections of the tax code.
<p>


<b>THE COMPETING TAX PLANS</b>
<p>
	While there is widespread agreement on what is wrong with the tax system, there is considerable debate over which plan best solves these problems. The following are the key features of the major tax reform proposals currently under consideration:
<p>
<b>Armey/Shelby flat tax</b> -- Based on the Hall/Rabushka flat tax, H.R. 2060 and S. 1050, sponsored by House Majority Leader Richard K. Armey (R-TX) and Senator Richard Shelby (R-AL), would replace the current personal and corporate income tax system with a simple 17 percent tax on all income. With the exception of a generous family allowance, all labor income is taxed at the individual level. Taxes on business income (such as interest, dividends, capital gains, and rents) are withheld and paid at the business level. Both businesses and individuals would fill out postcard-sized returns. 
<p>
<b>National retail sales tax</b> -- This proposal would replace the personal and corporate income taxes with a sales tax. Many details remain unknown, such as what tax rate would be applied and what goods and services, if any, would be exempted. As of publication, there is no legislation to create a national sales tax, although Representatives Dan Schaefer (R-CO) and Billy Tauzin (R-LA) may introduce a bill shortly. 
<p>
<b>Value-added tax</b> -- This tax, known as the VAT, is similar to a national sales tax, except that it is levied on the additional value created at each stage of production. For example, instead of a 25 percent retail sales tax on purchases at a furniture store, the VAT would tax the logs as they go to the sawmill, the lumber as it goes to the furniture manufacturer, the furniture as it goes to the store, and the same furniture as it is sold to the consumer. The net effect, however, is the same:  a 25 percent tax on the value of the retail sale. There currently is no legislation to replace income taxes with a VAT, although House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer (R-TX) intends to introduce some type of direct consumption tax.
<p>
<b>Nunn/Domenici USA tax</b> -- Sponsored by Senators Sam Nunn (D-GA) and Pete Domenici (R-NM), the Unlimited Savings Account tax (S. 722) creates the equivalent of an unlimited Individual Retirement Account (IRA) and replaces the current rate structure with a three-rate structure that includes a top rate of 40 percent. Some deductions are lost or curtailed, and at least one new deduction is created. The corporate income tax is replaced by a VAT.
<p>
<b>Gephardt 10 percent tax</b> -- This plan, introduced by House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-MO), broadens the tax base by eliminating such preferences as deductions for charitable contributions and state and local taxes and taxing the value of fringe benefits. The proposal also replaces the five current tax brackets with five new brackets ranging between 10 percent and 34 percent.
<p>
<b>Specter flat tax</b> -- Using the same model as the Armey/Shelby flat tax, Senator Arlen Specter (R-PA), in S. 488, proposes a slightly higher rate and lower personal allowance in order to maintain limited deductions for charitable contributions and the full deduction for home mortgage interest.
<p>
	Other tax reform proposals are expected in coming months. Senator Connie Mack (R-FL) may introduce a version of the flat tax which presumably will have many of the same economic benefits as the Armey/Shelby legislation. Senator Bill Bradley (D-NJ) is rumored to be preparing a tax reform bill, though no details are available and his decision to retire may alter those plans. Finally, as the tax reform debate heats up, the Administration might introduce its own plan. The President has said that he finds the flat tax appealing, and Chief of Staff Leon Panetta introduced flat tax legislation as a Member of Congress in 1983. The White House also has expressed interest in the value-added tax,8 although it is unlikely that the Administration would support a VAT as a replacement for the income tax.<p>	<b>GRADING THE TAX PLANS</b><p>	While each reform has an overall grade, it is particularly useful to see how the different proposals address specific flaws in the current system. The grades in the following section indicate the extent to which different tax plans reflect nine important principles of sound tax policy.
<p>
<b>Low Rates</b> 
<p>
	Low tax rates ensure that taxpayers have little incentive to hide, shelter, and underreport income. Because willingness to work, save, invest, and take risks is tied to the expected rewards of such behavior, the lower the tax rate(s), the higher the level of economic growth.
<p>
Armey/Shelby flat tax: <b>A</b>
<p>
	The flat tax popularized by the House Majority Leader begins with a 20 percent rate that phases down to 17 percent in the third year.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	Assuming a low rate and with income not taxed directly, the penalty on the creation of wealth would be minor.9<p>Value-added tax:  <b>A</b><p>	As with the national sales tax, a VAT with a low rate would have minimal impact on working, savings, and investment.<p>Nunn/Domenici USA tax:  <b>D</b><P>	The top tax rate in the USA tax is 40 percent, even higher than in current law. To make matters worse, it applies to taxable incomes as low as $24,000 for a family of four.
<p>
Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>C</b>
<p>
	Like the current system, the Minority Leader's plan has five separate rates. These rates are slightly lower than in current law, but the expansion of taxable income and the income levels at which the different rates apply offset this minor improvement.
<p>
Specter flat tax: <b>A-</b>
<p>
	The Specter plan's low 20 percent flat rate would stimulate increased work, savings, and investment when compared with current law, although it could be even lower if the remaining deductions were scrapped.
<p>


<b>Simplicity </b>
<p>
	The current income tax has more than 400 different forms, requires more than one billion 1099 forms (tracking interest and dividend income), and necessitates more than five billion hours of effort each year.10 While individuals rightly complain about the costs of simply compiling information, calculating their taxes, and understanding forms, compliance costs for business are twice as high.
<p>
Armey/Shelby flat tax:  <b>A</b>	
<p>
	The current system's plethora of documents, paperwork, and complex record-keeping would be greatly simplified by two postcard-sized forms, one for individuals and one for business.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>B</b>
<p>
	Compliance costs for individuals would disappear, though retail businesses would bear an increased burden because they would be responsible for collecting the tax and complying with reporting requirements.
<p>
Value-added tax:  <b>B+</b>
<p>
	Individual compliance costs would vanish, as would the daunting complexities of the corporate income tax, but businesses would have to maintain detailed records to calculate their share of tax liability as goods and services travel through the production process.
<p>
Nunn/Domenici USA tax: <b> B-</b>
<p>
	Since the burden of the corporate income tax is even worse than a VAT, compliance costs for business would fall under a USA tax. Individual compliance costs could rise relative to the current system, however, because of requirements for tracking deposits and withdrawals into the unlimited IRA.
<p>

Gephardt 10 percent tax: <b>C+</b>
<p>
	The corporate income tax remains the same, but many deductions for the personal income tax are eliminated. This would lead to slightly lower compliance costs for individuals.
<p>
Specter flat tax:  <b>A-</b>
<p>
	With the exception of tracking home mortgage and charitable contributions, the Specter version of the flat tax, like the Armey/Shelby version, also significantly reduces compliance costs.
<p>


<b>Savings and Investment</b> 
<p>
	By double-taxing, triple-taxing, and sometimes even quadruple-taxing income from capital, the current system significantly hinders capital formation. This reduces the quality and quantity of machinery, equipment, and technology in the economy and lowers wages by reducing the amount workers can produce.
<p>

Armey/Shelby flat tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	All income is taxed, but only subject to one level of tax. The current multiple taxation of capital income is eliminated. While this would boost savings and investment compared to current law, the effect would be to make the tax code neutral, neither encouraging nor discouraging savings, investment, or consumption.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	By not taxing income directly, the retail sales tax removes the bias in the existing system against savings and investment.
<p>
Value-added tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	Like the sales tax, the VAT addresses the capital formation problem by ending income taxation altogether.
<p>
Nunn/Domenici USA tax: <b>B</b>
<p>
	While the USA tax eliminates the bias against savings and investment caused by multiple taxation by providing an unlimited IRA, it dampens incentives to save and invest by imposing sharply graduated rates.
<p>
Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>D-</b>
<p>
	The Minority Leader's plan not only retains the existing anti-savings, anti-investment features of the current system, but also makes the tax code even more hostile to savings and investment by including provisions such as an increase in the tax rate on capital gains.
<p>
Specter flat tax:  <b>A-</b>
<p>
	As with all flat taxes based on the Hall/Rabushka model, there is no bias against capital formation. The continuation of certain deductions, particularly the mortgage interest deduction, does result in a mild distortion of market forces.11<p><b>Social Engineering</b><p>	The tax code today rewards some types of activity, everything from putting a child in daycare to buying a home. Other behaviors, however, such as savings and investment, are penalized harshly. Particularly disturbing is the ability of special interests to add special preferences to the tax code on behalf of wealthy clients.
<P>
Armey/Shelby flat tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	The only preference in the pure flat tax is a family allowance. Government would not attempt to steer economic decisions or try to penalize or reward different types of behavior.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	Presuming it would apply equally to all goods and services, the retail sales tax would get government out of the business of micromanaging private decisions. There is a danger, of course, that politicians would impose higher rates on unpopular goods and services (tobacco, caviar, imports) while granting lower or zero rates to others (food, shelter, health care).
<p>
Value-added tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	Like the sales tax, a pure VAT ends government favoritism and efforts to subsidize certain industries or activities. The same caveat -- the potential for discriminatory rates -- applies.
<p>
Nunn/Domenici USA tax:  <b>B</b>
<p>
	Some deductions are eliminated, but this is offset by the creation of new ones such as a deduction for educational expenses. The USA proposal, however, does end the current code's explicit penalties on savings and investment.
<p>
Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>B-</b>
<p>
	With the exception of the home mortgage interest deduction, special preferences in the tax code are eliminated. The Minority Leader's plan even taxes fringe benefits. Existing penalties on savings and investment, however, are made even worse by increasing the capital gains tax.
<p>
Specter flat tax: <b>A-</b>
<p>
	Except for continuing limited individual deductions for mortgage interest and charitable contributions, the Specter version of the flat tax takes government officials out of the business of picking winners and losers.
<p>


<b>Intrusiveness/Civil Liberties </b>
<P>
	In part because of the code's numbing complexity, but also because of legislative directives, the IRS engages in tax collection activities that many believe are abusive. A simple tax code, with easily understood rules that apply to everyone, would solve much of this problem. Because all tax systems ultimately are based on coercion, and thus are accompanied by police powers for the taxing authority, the highest grades are given to proposals that minimize the scope and opportunity for intrusion.
<P>

Armey/Shelby flat tax: <b> A</b>
<p>
	By dramatically reducing the complexities of the current system, this plan would leave taxpayers with less reason to fear the IRS. For individual taxpayers, the only possible areas of controversy are the size of one's family and the amount of labor income earned (taxes on capital income are withheld and paid at the business level). Whatever problems remain -- including how the self-employed handle deductions, particularly if they work out of their homes -- would be a fraction of those that exist now.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	Small businesses will not appreciate collecting taxes for the federal government, but the level of intrusion resulting from a properly designed sales tax is small compared with the current system. This is particularly true in states that already impose sales taxes.
<p>
Value-added tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	In its pure form, the VAT should minimize most tax collection abuses. Businesses would need to maintain records, but the impositions on privacy would be small compared with the current system.12<p>Nunn/Domenici USA tax:  <b>C</b>	<p>	Much of the current tax system is left in place. Moreover, the government will require detailed financial records from individuals who lower their tax burden by saving.<p>Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>C</b><p>	Some deductions disappear, presumably reducing the potential for disputes with the IRS, but the multiple taxation of savings and investment becomes more pervasive, a step that will create more conflicts between citizens and tax authorities. The net effect is probably zero.
<P>
Specter flat tax:  <b>A-</b>
<p>
	Simple and straightforward, the Specter flat tax should eliminate most abuses. Retention of certain limited deductions, however, requires record-keeping and creates opportunities for IRS intrusion into taxpayers' personal affairs.
<p>


<b>Fairness</b>
<P>
	Fairness in the tax system should mean equal treatment. Any special treatment, either preference or penalty, violates this principle. All taxpayers -- and all income -- should be treated equally.
<P>
	
Armey/Shelby flat tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	All taxpayers pay the same rate, and all income is taxed once. The only exemption is the zero bracket amount (personal allowance) based on family size.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>A</b>
<P>
	All taxpayers presumably will pay the same rate, and all goods and services presumably will be taxed. As with the flat tax, there probably will be some mechanism to eliminate any tax liability for those with low incomes.
<p>
Value-added tax:  <b>A</b>
<P>
	Like the retail sales tax, the VAT theoretically should apply equally to all taxpayers and not discriminate by charging different rates. Also, there likely will be a process by which to offset the tax burden for the poor.
<p>
Nunn/Domenici USA tax:  <b>C-</b>
<p>
	Maintaining steeply graduated rates means that the law will not apply equally to all taxpayers. Government would continue to interfere with economic decisions by granting preferential treatment to certain activities. Also, the estate tax would remain, applying double taxation to the affected income.
<p>
Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>D-</b>
<P>
	Like the USA tax, the Gephardt proposal includes steeply progressive rates that explicitly impose special penalties on certain citizens. Compounding this error is its exacerbation of the current code's multiple taxation of capital income. The only provision that precludes a failing grade is the elimination of some deductions.
<p>
Specter flat tax:  <b>A-</b>
<P>
	This proposal has all the fairness of the Armey plan, with the exception of modest deductions for mortgage interest and charitable contributions.
<P>

<b>Downside Risk</b>
<p>
	While many tax reform proposals are conceptually attractive and would boost the economy if enacted, they should not be examined in a vacuum. The long-term ability of each tax to retain these theoretical benefits must be considered.
<p>
Armey/Shelby flat tax:  <b>B</b>
<P>
	Just as lawmakers began raising rates after the 1986 tax reform act, future Congresses could undo a flat tax. One advantage of a pure flat tax, however, is that any changes would be obvious to voters. 
<p>
 The worst that could happen is that policy might drift back to where it is now, but a constitutional amendment requiring a supermajority to raise tax rates would address this concern.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>F</b>
<p>
	The great risk with a retail sales tax is that politicians might adopt a direct consumption tax, but never get around to abolishing the income tax. Also, if state experience is any indication, a sales tax might be manipulated so that some products are exempted while others are subjected to punitive rates. A constitutional amendment explicitly barring an income tax would solve this problem.
<p>
Value-added tax:  <b>F</b>
<p>
	All the risks inherent in a retail sales tax exist with a VAT. The European experience shows that it gives politicians an incentive to have both a direct consumption tax and an income tax.13 Moreover, the VAT is applied at arbitrary and uneven rates in most countries. As with the sales tax, a constitutional change could resolve this concern.
<p>
Nunn/Domenici USA tax:  <b>F</b>
<p>
	The USA proposal replaces the corporate income tax with a VAT. Therefore, concerns that the government might have two major revenue sources are not just theory, but reality. The risk also exists that the corporate income tax either would never be abolished or would be recreated.
<p>
Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>C</b>
<p>
	In a sense, there is not much downside risk with the Gephardt plan because the proposal is not an improvement over current law. On the plus side, the plan creates no new taxes and would require a referendum to increase taxes in the future.
<p>
Specter flat tax:  <b> B-</b>
<p>
	Like the Armey/Shelby proposal, the Specter flat tax is haunted by the evidence since the 1986 tax reform act. Because the Specter version explicitly accepts the notion that policymakers should impose tax preferences because it preserves certain deductions, the risks are somewhat higher that the tax code could be skewed even further.
<p>

<b>Evasion </b>
<p>
	Support for any tax system and its long-term viability depends on how the law works. If there are opportunities for individuals to evade taxes -- and if enough of them take advantage of those opportunities -- the public will view the law as corrupt. Moreover, the loss of revenue will encourage politicians to raise rates on those who do comply with the law, thereby encouraging still more evasion. The downward spiral of higher rates followed by more evasion could be endless.
<p>
Armey/Shelby flat tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	Because of its low rate, this tax provides minimal incentives for evasion. Moreover, by taxing business income at the source, it eliminates the need for more than one billion 1099 forms and simplifies enforcement considerably.
<p>
National retail sales tax:  <b>D</b>
<p>
	The evidence suggests that retail sales taxes higher than about 10 percent are subject to widespread evasion.14 Indeed, almost every country with a VAT originally had a sales tax but changed once rates crept above that level because of problems with complexity and compliance.15<p>Value-added tax:  <b>B+</b>	<p>	A VAT does allow the government to enforce much greater compliance than is possible under a sales tax because the tax is collected at each stage of the production process and there is no need to track whether a product is being sold at retail or wholesale.<p>Nunn/Domenici USA tax:  <b>B</b><p>	The high tax rates in the USA tax will increase incentives to use the underground economy. Moreover, because there will be no tax on income put into savings (and no taxes levied on funds withdrawn from savings), there could be incentives to find ways to manipulate this system.
<p>
Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>C</b>
<p>
	Evasion is not likely to change significantly under the Minority Leader's plan. Eliminating certain deductions could reduce evasion opportunities, but increasing the multiple taxation of capital income will increase incentives to hide or underreport income.
<p>

Specter flat tax:  <b>A-</b>
<p>
	Retaining limited deductions and taxing at a slightly higher rate could cause a modest reduction in compliance compared to a pure flat tax since there would be an opportunity to exaggerate deductions.
<p>


<b>International Competitiveness</b> 
<p>
	In a world where capital funds react quickly to changes in a nation's business climate, a tax system that rewards entrepreneurship will attract increased investment and job creation. A system that penalizes growth with high tax rates and imposes multiple levels of taxation on capital income, by contrast, will suffer from capital flight. In addition to their effects on growth, international provisions in the current code are a major source of complexity. Unfortunately, as Chart 4 illustrates, America has undermined its ability to compete by raising tax rates while most of our competitors have been cutting tax rates.
<p>
Armey/Shelby flat tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	By eliminating the multiple taxation of capital income, all flat taxes based on the Hall/Rabushka model will trigger a surge of new investment and jobs in the United States. By ending the complex practice of taxing American companies and individuals on their foreign income (already taxed in the country where it is earned), the flat tax model will lower compliance costs dramatically and encourage more U.S. firms to enter the global market.
<p>
National retail sales tax:   <b>A</b>
<p>
	Replacing the current, deeply flawed income tax with a direct consumption tax will boost international competitiveness, increase investment, and stimulate job creation. However, the benefits result from ending the income tax, not from imposing the sales tax. Some proponents argue that a sales tax would help the economy and the balance of trade, because it would be levied on goods and services coming into the country while exports would be exempt. This would not create a competitive advantage for America.16 Products sold in America, whether foreign-made or domestic, would be subject to the U.S. sales tax. Likewise, products sold in other countries, whether domestic or American-made, would be subject to applicable sales taxes or VATs in those countries.
<P>
Value-added tax:  <b>A</b>
<p>
	As with the retail sales tax, a VAT will attract foreign investment and encourage job creation. As noted above, these benefits do not flow automatically from a direct consumption tax. VATs and other sales-based taxes simply create level playing fields. Their benefits stem from elimination of the income tax.
<P>
Nunn/Domenici USA tax:  <b>B</b>
<p>
	Like the Armey/Shelby flat tax, the USA tax largely ends the complex practice of taxing businesses on income earned overseas. It also eliminates most multiple taxes on capital income, a reform that would encourage foreign investment. Unfortunately, some of these incentives would be offset by high marginal tax rates.
<p>
Gephardt 10 percent tax:  <b>C</b>
<p>
	Because the current tax system penalizes growth with high tax rates and imposes multiple levels of taxation on capital income, it is extremely destructive to international competitiveness. The Minority Leader's proposal might exacerbate this problem somewhat by expanding the multiple taxation of capital income.17<p>Specter flat tax:  <b>A-</b><p>	With a low rate and no tax burden on foreign income because it already is taxed by the nation where it is earned, the Specter flat tax would boost growth and attract capital from overseas.<p><b>CONCLUSION</b><p>	The current income tax system demands comprehensive reform. High rates punish success, excessive complexity drains productive resources, and punitive taxation of capital income retards savings and investment. Of the many proposals have been offered to correct these flaws, reforms based on the Hall/Rabushka flat tax are the best. The flat tax replaces the current five-tiered punitive rate structure with a simple, fair 17 percent rate. The current system's plethora of documents, paperwork, and complex record-keeping is replaced by two postcard-sized forms, one for individuals and one for business. 
<p>
	 Direct consumption taxes like the retail sales tax and VAT theoretically achieve similar results, though such proposals also risk creating major new sources of tax revenue for the federal government. If these proposals were made contingent on enacting a constitutional amendment barring income taxes, this concern would disappear. Finally, plans that attempt to preserve features of the current system, such as the USA tax and the Gephardt 10 percent tax, fall short of the goal. By maintaining a discriminatory system of graduated rates, these plans fail the critical tests of growth, simplicity, and fairness.

	"Last year, when World War II hero Bob Dole was a candidate for the Republican nomination for president, the U.S. Military Academy at West Point wanted to invite him to a ceremony commemorating the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Europe.
<P>
 
	"The academy superintendent even prepared a letter inviting Mr. Dole to not only speak, but to lead a parade, in his honor, of 4,000 cadets. Mr. Dole, who received advance word of the invitation, began drafting remarks, focusing mostly on his wartime experiences. 
<P>
	"As required, West Point's invitation was sent to the Pentagon for approval by the secretary of defense. It was denied.
<P> 
	"Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon spokesmannot Defense Secretary William J. Perrytook credit for the rejection. It was against regulations for the news media to accompany presidential candidates on military bases, he explained. 
<P>
	"Mr. Dole could visit West Point, but only alone. 
<P>
	"At the invitation of Mr. Perry, Chinese Defense Minister Gen. Chi Haotianthe architect of the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989arrives today for a 10-day visit in the United States.
<P> 
	"While here, Gen. Chi will tour several major U.S. military bases, including the Navy base at Norfolk, Fort Hood in Texas and the headquarters of the U.S. Pacific Command in Hawaii.
<P> 
	"Asked this week if the Pentagon had any reservations about rolling out the red carpet for someone who had unleashed tanks and troops against unarmed civilians, Mr. Bacon curtly replied: 'The answer to the question is No.' "

"Barbara Coe, a leading proponent of immigration reform in California, was threatened with legal action by the Justice Department, the Orange County Registrar's Office, and immigrant advocacy groups for 'intimidating voters' on Election Day.
<P> 
	"Her crime? Distributing fliers that proclaimed: 'Only citizens can vote! Violators will be prosecuted!'
<P>
	"Latino groups saw her campaign as a blatant, racist effort to intimidate legitimate voters, many of whom were new citizens casting their first votes. But Mrs. Coe, 62, a Huntington Beach grandmother, said she felt the fliers were necessary to combat voter fraud after hearing from Hispanic members of the California Coalition for Immigration Reform, which she founded and chairs. . . .
<P>
	"In her view, the problem is twofold. Many immigrants are unaware that noncitizens cannot vote. Others, however, 'know it's against the law, but they don't care. They know there's no prosecution. There are no safeguards,' she said. 
<P>
	"She already has obtained a list of 18 illegal immigrants who voted, compiled by a social worker on duty at a local polling place, she said. . . .
<P>
	"An official from the Justice Department's civil-rights division called and interviewed her for more than an hour about complaints they'd received about her fliers. . . .
<P>
	"Then the Orange County registrar of voters called. 'She was just ballistic,' Mrs. Coe recalled. 'She said, If I get one complaint of voter intimidation, I'm going to prosecute you to the full extent of the law.'
<p>
	"Likewise, California Secretary of State Bill Jones put her on notice that he would not tolerate any intimidation activities. 'Interfering with any individual's right to vote . . . is a crime,' he wrote." . . .

"We've seen Gary Aldrich's name on the best-seller list for several months now. Obviously he's raking in the dough with his book <I>Unlimited Access: An FBI Agent Inside the Clinton White House</I>. Think again. In fact, if the White House has its way, Mr. Aldrich may never see a dime in book royalties. 'I put all I own on the line to expose the criminal behavior and discredited security procedures in the Clinton White House,' Mr. Aldrich writes in a public appeal for donations. 'Now, my wife, Nina, and I and our three young children could lose everything. That's right, everything.' Attorney General Janet Reno, the former FBI agent writes, is deciding whether to prosecute him and confiscate the proceeds of his book, as the FBI recommends. . . .'Even now, the Clinton Administration lawyers are threatening to tie up all my assets and keep me in court for six years or more,' Mr. Aldrich writes in his letter. He says he's already spent nearly $100,000 in legal fees, exhausting his life savings fighting lawyers from the FBI, Justice Department, and White House."

	"This is the concession that the National highway Traffic Safety Administration proposed last month, in response to growing public alarm over the risks posed by air bags to children. To date, more than 30 children have been killed by air-bag deployment, many of them in low-speed accidents, and there is mounting evidence that these devices may endanger certain adults as well. The children's deaths are not merely a tragic side effect; air bags kill more kids under age 10 than they save."

<P>
	"Not surprisingly, some of the course descriptions that standout, even in this amazing list, come from the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, locally called Zoo Mass, where the education department offers three different courses on 'Special Issues in Education,' including two fairly recent concerns of the left, 'HandicapismDynamics of Handicapism on Personal and Institutional Levels,' 'HeterosexismDynamics of Heterosexism on Personal and Institutional Levels,' and third, that timeworn leftist obsession, 'ClassismDynamics of Classism on Personal and Institutional Levels.'
<P>
	"But from the University of California at Santa Cruz comes the scariest offering. A Big Brotheror should we say, Big Sister-minded education department presents students with Education 189: 'Monitoring Girls for Science and Math Equity: This six-credit, multiple-term course provides opportunities for women students from any discipline to mentor girls in local K12 classrooms. Mentors are trained to promote equity in science, math, and technology.' Gifted boys had better learn to keep quiet or face fierce reprimand."

	"Florida prison doors will swing wide open for 445 murderers, sex offenders, kidnappers, and child abusers beginning today after a state Supreme Court restored time off for good behavior for the state's most violent offenders, prison officials said. Attorney General Bob Butterworth said he'll appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court, but by then hundreds of inmates will have been released. Officials are trying to determine who will be freed immediately. The pending releases have generated protests from the public. 'We've done everything we can to keep them locked up,' Corrections Department spokeswoman Debbie Buchanan said. 'We don't have any choice. Our hands are tied.' "

	"A furor erupted in Virginia this summer when an investigator, hired by Governor George Allen to probe state agencies distributing $17 million in federal funds for day-care and early-childhood programs, discovered financial mismanagement including the 'steering' of funds  to organizations with a leftist ideology. Some of the groups that received money promoted a college curriculum for 'politically  correct' day-care professionals. One such group, the National Association for the Education of Young Children, published an 'anti-bias curriculum' that argues that homophobia 'must be addressed in the day-care setting.' Not only this, but the 'anti-bias educator of young children must be prepared to address both the gender and sexual differentiations of the sexes for two-year olds' and to identify 'oppressive situations which might be addressed by boycotts or demonstrations during day-care sessions.'

<h2>External Relations Department</h2>
<hr>
<p>
Founded in January 1995, the External Relations department handles Heritage's outreach to the business community, to other policy organizations, and to the nation's governors and state officials. 
<p>
External Relations is headed by Heritage Vice President <a href="/heritage/staff/gaynerl.htm">Lew Gayner</a>, who directs department activities with the assistance of his managers: Bridgett Wagner, director of <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/business.html">Business Relations</a>; <a href="/heritage/staff/atwood.htm">Tom Atwood</a>, director of Coalition Relations; and the Project on Federalism and the States director, <a href="/heritage/staff/seay.htm">Doug Seay</a>.
<p>
To reach their target audiences, Gayner and his staff  sponsor Washington Policy Roundtables, bi-monthly forums for Washington-based corporate representatives; the Physicians Council, a coalition of doctors who advocate health care reform based on consumer choice and competition; the <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/rban.htm">Resource Bank</a>, Heritage's networking arm to other public policy groups in the U. S. and abroad; and <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/gov_for.htm">The Project on Federalism and the States</a> which works to directly involve governors and state and local government officials in national policy decisions.
<p>
Gayner also directs Heritage's Corporate Associates, a program of conferences, briefings, and special publications for the Foundation's major corporate donors; co-sponsors the American Trader Initiative Advisory Council, a coalition of business and public policy leaders who advise Heritage on trade issues; and hosts bi-annual National Security Symposiums for the defense industry.  In addition, External Relations hosts monthly working group meetings with congressional staff and provides private briefings for business executives at Heritage and at corporate headquarters.

<TITLE> A Tyranny of the Judiciary?
 -- November 1996 Insider - Heritage</TITLE>

<h3>November, 1996 <i>Insider</i></h3></center> 



<CENTER><h3> A Tyranny of the Judiciary?
</h3></CENTER><HR>
<P>
<dd>	Consider the many conservative policy proposals which have been enacted recently, or are on your "wish list." Think about the tremendous popular support many of these plans enjoy. . . .Then realize that the courts have overturned some of these programs already and may well derail numerous others. 
<P>
<dd>
	The combination of litigious, liberal advocacy groups and a judiciary too often willing to make law, rather than interpret the Constitution threatens to negate many of the gains conservatives have made in the war of ideas and at the ballot box. As soon as a program such as school choice or the California Civil Rights Initiative passes, a lawsuit is immediately filed to prevent its implementation. 
<P>
<dd>
	What we seem to get in many cases is a tyranny of judges -- <I>de facto</I> rule by jurists whose power is unchecked and who see fit to mold society to suit their own personal concepts of justice. Most often, this judicial activism reinforces the reigning liberal orthodoxy which has taken hold of American legal institutions.
<P>
<dd>
	As conservatives prepare to wage many crucial battles in the courts, the Federalist Society has built a network designed to overcome legal abuses and to return America to a legal system which operates according to the design of the founders.
<P>
<dd>
	The Federalist Society advances traditional legal principles such as limited, constitutional government; individual freedom and responsibility; traditional values; and the rule of law. Our 22,000 lawyers, law students, academics, public officials, and other concerned citizens actively forward these ideals locally and nationally.

<P>
<dd>	The Society's 145 Student Division chapters at law schools across the country and 60 Lawyers Division chapters in major legal centers provide us with a grass-roots community presence nationwide.
	<P>
<dd>The combination of our strong local base and our national stature allows the Federalist Society to promote the serious inquiry which generates solutions to vital legal and policy questions. Our members are increasingly involved in every stage of the public policy process from recognizing political opportunities to building intellectual and academic support to winning legislative debates. 
<P>
<dd>	We aim to involve in the public policy discussion Citizen-Lawyers who will fight the legal and policy battles crucial to our principles. Today, there is much of this work to be done.
<P>
<dd>
	The following list of activities highlights some of the ways in which the Federalist Society is forwarding its goals:
<P>
<dd>
	Our <b>E.L. Wiegand Practice Groups</b> create a national network of active attorneys dedicated to traditional legal principles. The 15 topics covered by the Practice Groups include: Civil Rights, Constitutional Law, Corporate Law, Criminal Law, Environmental Law, Free Speech, Intellectual Property, Litigation, and Religious Liberties. By mobilizing our members in this manner, we will have a large impact on the development of law in each of these areas.
<P>
<dd>
	The Society's <b><i>Pro Bono</i> Resource Network</b> links Federalist Society lawyers with like-minded groups and individuals needing legal assistance. Through this outreach, our members use their professional talents on behalf of the principles in which they believe.
<P>
<dd>
	The <b>ABA Watch Project</b> centers around a semi-annual <i>ABA Watch</i> newsletter, the first of which was released in August at the American Bar Association convention. This periodical publicizes the activities of the ABA. In so doing, we expect to generate a great deal of discussion about the organized bar and the fears of many that it has become a left-wing advocacy group.
<P>
<dd>
	Of course, the Society's core programs -- local chapter meetings, national and regional conferences, and publications -- will continue to promote traditional legal principles. 
	<P>
<dd>
In sum, the Federalist Society educates the legal community and the general public about the proper role of the legal system, activates legal professionals on behalf of conservative causes, and provides assistance to friendly local, state-wide, and national groups.

The Heritage Foundation Asian Studies Center<hr>
<P>
John Dori, Research Associate of the Asian Studies Center at The Heritage Foundation, and Richard Fisher, Senior Policy Analyst of the Asian Studies Center at The Heritage Foundation, have compiled the 11th annual U.S. and Asia Statistical Handbook. The authors note that U.S.-Asia trade grew dramatically in 1995. The rise in exports to Asia outpaced the growth of exports to all other regions of the world. To help policy makers and the public understand the key issues facing the world's most dynamic region, the Asian Studies Center has compiled key social, political, economic, and military statistics on the United States and 33 countries in East of South Asia. this year's edition includes a chart summarizing the findings of Heritage's Index of Economic Freedom. 91 pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto:Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org,</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.heritage.org">http://www.heritage.org</a>.

 by John Hillen<br>
<I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1096, The Heritage Foundation<hr>
<p>
John Hillen, Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation, argues that the United States must enact a staged removal of U.S. and NATO military forces from Bosnia in order to avoid a likely decades-long military commitment to the region. Specifically, according to Hillen, the U.S. should keep only a limited number of support troops in Bosnia in 1997, and there should be no U.S. ground troops in a new follow-on implementation force. The follow-on implementation force should be European-led, and eventually lead to European responsibility for the regional peacekeeping burden. All U.S. troops should be removed by 1998, for, according to Hillen, America's main purpose in NATO is not to police ethnic conflicts in Europe. The peacekeeping responsibility should come under such European organizations as the Western European Union or the Organization for the Security and Cooperation in Europe after NATO's departure.  11 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto:Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org,</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.heritage.org">http://www.heritage.org</a>.

<B><a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/asc143.html">Building a Better U.S. Partnership With Australia</a>,</b><br>
 by Robert O'Quinn<br>
<I>Asian Studies Backgrounder</I> No. 143, The Heritage Foundation<hr>
<P>
Robert O'Quinn, Policy Analyst at the Asian Studies Center of The Heritage Foundation, argues that the United States should build a better partnership with Australia to protect its economic and security interests in the Asia-Pacific region. Australia has recently become a major player in the region. This has been due to Australia's efforts over the past ten years to deregulate its economy and dismantle its extremely protectionist trade policies that nearly brought the country to economic ruin by the 1980s. Australia has embraced the dynamic Asian market and reoriented its diplomatic and economic ties toward Asia and the United States. O'Quinn notes that the U.S. cannot duplicate the diplomatic, economic, and military ties that proximity and diplomacy have presented to Australia. To secure vital American interests in the Asia-Pacific region, according to O'Quinn, Washington should cooperate with Canberra on trade and security issues. Specifically, the President should: ask Congress to end the dairy, agriculture export subsidy, and sugar programs that have prevented further trade liberalization in Australia; ask congress to allow intracoastal-coastal shipping to use foreign-built, foreign-operated, or foreign-owned vessels to reduce logistics costs for American firms; ask Congress for fast-track authority to negotiate trade agreements free of contentious environmental and labor standards issues; ask congress to take further steps all around to liberalize trade, especially in areas of conflict between the U.S. and Australia; and strengthen U.S. military ties to Australia by offering to sell Canberra <I>Tomahawk</I> long-range cruise missiles and by including Australia in the development of a future Asian missile defense network. 15 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto:Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org,</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.heritage.org">http://www.heritage.or

<B>Trashing Free Trade: The Basel Convention's Impact on International Commerce</B>, <br>
by James Sheehan<br>
Competitive Enterprise Institute<hr><P>
James Sheehan, Research Associate at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, discusses international hazard waste regulations and their impact on international commerce. The Basel Convention was signed in 1989 to create a global regulatory regime to control trade in hazardous wastes. It has three primary objectives: 1) reduce transboundary movements of hazardous wastes to a minimum; 2) ensure that hazardous wastes be treated and disposed of as close as possible to their source of generation; and 3) minimize hazardous waste generation at source. Sheehan argues that global hazardous waste regulation does nothing to change the root causes of environmental degradation. He notes that illegal dumping of waste is most often a problem in countries where there is little private property, and unresponsive or corrupt government bureaucracies. International trade  does not directly cause environmental degradation, and international trade controls cut off developing countries from important materials and supplies that only international markets can supply. Many developing countries see environmental demands by industrialized nations as new forms of protectionism designed to close markets. Sheehan argues that the U.S. should refrain from further active participation in the Basel Convention. According to Sheehan, the U.S. should reject even the possibility of global trade regulation and an export ban. Free trade and government controls are incompatible concepts. He concludes that developing countries must stand firm against the green trade restrictions of the Basel Convention. 22 pp.  CONTACT: Competitive Enterprise Institute, 1001 Connecticut Avenue, N.W., Suite 1250, Washington, D.C. 20036, 202/331-1010, fax 202/331-0640.

<I>Hoover Essays</I>, Hoover Institution<hr>
<P>
In this essay, Peter Duignan and Lewis Gann, Senior Fellows at the Hoover Institution, write about the consequences of the collapse of the Soviet Union. The authors note that the fall of the Soviet Union represented the downfall of a secular religion. Economically, politically and militarily, Soviet communism was a failure. They argue that Gorbachev was an unwitting agent of decolonization, and that Yeltsin represents the architect of Russian reconstruction.  42 pp. CONTACT: Hoover Institution Press, Stanford University Press, Stanford, CA  94305-6010, 415/723-3373, fax 415/723-1687, Internet 	<a href="http://www-hoover.Stanford.edu/index.html">http://www-hoover.Stanford.edu/index.html</a>.

<B>ESTIMATING OSHA COMPLIANCE COSTS</B>,<BR> 
BY HARVEY JAMES<BR>
<I>Policy Study</I> No. 135, Center for the Study of American Business<hr>
<p>
According to a study by economist Harvey James, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) imposes greater regulatory compliance costs to the economy than previously estimated. Based on regulatory impact analyses (RIAs) commissioned by OSHA of 25 major rules issued by the agency after 1980, he estimates that manufacturers in 1993 paid an additional 46,300 each year on average per firm for the 25 OSHA regulations established since 1980. James's analysis has revealed some interesting facts, including: Construction firm spending exceeds $700,000 annually per firm to comply with just one hazardous waste operations regulation; OSHA rules on air quality and process safety are the most costly in the manufacturing sector with costs exceeding $9,000 and $36,000 a year per firm, respectively; the cost of compliance with OSHA's lead standard is nearly $400,000 a year for affected manufacturers; and OSHA's study of the economic impact of proposed Comprehensive Occupational Safety and Health Reform Act (COSHRA) projects total compliance costs at over $10 billion a year. James argues that in order to expose the full impact of OSHA regulations, a reliable survey of compliance expenditures needs to be established. He proposes a survey similar to the Pollution Abatement and Control Expenditures (PACE) reports made annually by the Census Bureau for the EPA. James concludes that there is reasonable basis for establishing a regulatory budget for OSHA. 29 pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington University, Campus Box 1208, St. Louis, MO 63130-4899, 314/935-5630, fax 314/935-5688.

<b>The Last Monopoly: Privatizing the Postal Service for the Information Age</b>, <br>
Edited by Edward Hudgins<br>
Cato Institute<hr>
<p>
The Cato Institute presents a collection of essays on returning mail delivery to the free market. The first chapter is by U.S. Postmaster General Marvin Runyon. He tries to make a case that there is a national consensus to keep government in the business of delivering the mail, but that the right amount of deregulation will allow the U.S. Postal Service to compete on equal footing with other couriers. He maintains that universal mail service "backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government," is necessary to bind the nation together. James Cambell looks at the creeping expansion of the postal monopoly. Peter Ferrara argues that their are inherent problems with a postal monopoly that have meant rates as much as 50 percent higher than they would be if competition were allowed. Stephen Gibson, Executive Director of the Bionomics Institute illustrates how the Information Age is bypassing the "Machine Age Postal Service." Economist  Thomas DiLorenzo and Richard Geddes contribute essays on "Natural Monopoly Myths" and "Patterns of Private Delivery," which undermine the case for privatizing the assets of the USPS and thereby moving postal services entirely into the free market. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher proposes converting the USPS into an employee stock-ownership company. And Douglas Adie, author of Monopoly Mail, proposes breaking up the U.S. Postal Service, into regional divisions that would then be sold off. 138 pp.  CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20001, 202/842-0200, fax 202/842-3490, E-mail <a href=:mailto: cato@cato.org ">cato@cato.org</a>, Internet <a href=" http://www.cato.org">http://www.cato.org</a>.

<b>What to Do About Universal Service Subsidies: Support for High-Cost Areas</b>,<br>
 by Wayne Leighton<br>
<I>Issue Analysis</I> No. 39, Citizens for a Sound Economy<hr>
<P>
Wayne Leighton, Senior Economist for Citizens for a Sound Economy, discusses the issue of Universal Service Subsidies for high-cost telephone service areas. The 1996 Telecommunications Act continues, and potentially expands, current universal service subsidies to high-cost telephone servicing areas. The Federal State Joint Board and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) have been granted considerable authority under the Act to significantly expand the current arrangement of subsidies. Leighton argues that a more limited approach could be taken by relegating more authority over universal service issues to state-level regulators and that subsidies should be brought to a minimum. The size of universal service subsidies, according to Leighton, should be based on the most accurate cost estimates. Methods for cost estimates based upon historical costs tend to inflate the amount of actual expenses incurred, while hypothetical estimates rely on a regulator's calculations. He concludes that for high-cost markets, competitive bidding may offer the most effective way to determine the minimum amount needed to provide a universal service subsidy. This would still guarantee the same quality of service to high-costs areas, while at the same time bringing competition to the market. This competition will drive costs down and efficiency up. 18 pp. CONTACT: Citizens for a Sound Economy, 1250 H Street, N.W., Suite 700, Washington, DC 20005-3908, 202/783-3870, fax 202/783-4687, Internet <a href="http://www.cse.org/cse">http://www.cse.org/cse</a>.

compiled by Ron Utt and Dan Hickey<br>
<I>F.Y.I.</I> No. 123, The Heritage Foundation<hr>
<p>
Ron Utt, Senior Fellow at The Heritage Foundation, and Dan Hickey, Special Assistant to The Heritage Foundation's Vice President for Domestic Policy Issues, have compiled a third report on instances of waste and excess in government spending. Utt and Hickey list the names and phone numbers of the people in charge of each government agency where the financial abuses took place. Cases of waste and excess includes: 1) The expenses from the widespread misuse of Vice President Al Gore's recommendation that government agencies make greater use of credit cards; 2) 93 percent failure of the Housing Authority of New Orleans (HANO) units in maintenance inspections, while 16 new Ford LTD Crown Victoria passenger vehicles were purchased for the central office staff despite the availability of only one pickup truck for HANO maintenance crews; 3) Massive subsidies for such absentee ranchers and farmers as Louis Farrakhan's Nation of Islam, and celebrity news reporter Sam Donaldson; 4) Amtrack's proposed use of $40 million in taxpayer money to set up costly new service between Boston and Portland, Maine, that will take longer than existing inexpensive private bus service; 5) Information from internal Agency for International Development (AID) reports that shows that up to one-third of the total funds spent on some projects are lost through gross misuse such as contributing to parties, gifts, obituaries in newspapers, flowers, tips, radios, conference prizes, and new clothes for Bank employees to wear to a population development conference; and finally, 6) Cases of food stamp abuse such as that by a Tennessee woman with assets valued at over $350,000 receiving $27,000 in food stamps and welfare benefits over a three-and-a-half-year period, and another instance where food stamps were used to by caviar. Finding room for tax relief can begin with eradicating such flagrant waste as the examples listed in this paper. 4 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-49

<B>Federal Revenue Estimates: What's Wrong; What Should be Done</B>,<br>
 by Michael Schuyler and Norman Ture<br>
<I>Fiscal Issues</I> No. 10, Institute for Research on the Economics of Taxation<hr>
<p>
Michael Schuyler, IRET Senior Economist, and Norman Ture, President of IRET, examine key deficiencies in federal procedures for estimating how tax changes affect government revenue. According to the authors, failings in current procedures, notably the insistence that tax changes do not affect the overall economy, systematically mislead policy makers, resulting in tax policies that may cost the American public hundreds of billions of dollars yearly. Schuyler and Ture call for correcting the deficiencies in the current estimating methodology. 70 pp.  CONTACT: IRET, 1300 19th Street, N.W., Suite 240, Washington, D.C. 20036, 202/463-1400, fax 202/463-6199.

<b>The Case for an Across-the-Board Tax Rate Reduction</b>, <br>
by Bruce Bartlett<br>
<I>Policy Backgrounder</I> No. 140, National Center for Policy Analysis<hr>
<p>
Bruce Bartlett, Senior Fellow at the National Center for Policy Analysis, puts forth the case for reducing tax rates across the board. He points out that total taxes as a share of the GDP were the highest in U.S. history in 1995 -- 31.3 percent. American paid $151.1 billion more in federal taxes than if federal receipts had remained at their 1992 level of 19.2 percent of GDP. Reducing individual income tax rates across the board by 15 percent would lower federal receipts as a share of GDP to what they were in 1992. The across-the-board tax cut would not solve the tax problem. A tax reduction must be accompanied by spending reduction. As long as federal spending consumes over 20 percent of our national output, it will be impossible to lower taxes as much as is needed. 13 pp. CONTACT: National Center for Policy Analysis, 12655 N.

<b>The Moral Case for the Flat Tax</b>,<br>
 by Steve Forbes<br>
<I>Imprimis</I> Vol. 25, No. 10, Hillsdale College<hr>
<P>
Former Presidential candidate, Steve Forbes puts forth a moral case for the Flat Tax. Forbes stresses how the current tax system leads to political, civic and cultural corruption. The current tax code is mind-numbing and complex, according to Forbes, and the leading source of corruption in Washington. Lobbyists and special interest groups are the largest private sector industry in Washington. Over half of them work to convince politicians to manipulate the tax code in their favor. A flat tax would close all loopholes and throw the lobbyists and special interests out of work. An unfair tax code and excessive taxation leads to civic corruption by taking away a citizen's sense of self-reliance and integrity. Many Americans view the current tax structure as "legalized plunder." Forbes points out that this has a corrosive impact on an individual's sense of responsibility and trust, two necessary components for society to thrive. Despite the trillions in American taxpayer money that has been spent in the name of "compassion," there is more crime, more illegitimacy, more illiteracy, more drug abuse, more broken families, and more members of the permanent underclass than ever before. A flat tax that exempts the poorest citizens would help end the cultural corruption that has resulted from failed big-government programs. Forbes concludes by arguing that the federal government cannot provide the moral influence necessary to preserve families, reawaken faith, restore values, solve social problems and create prosperity. 5 pp.  CONTACT: Hillsdale College, Hillsdale, MI 49242, 800/437-2268.

<B>Do Automobile Fuel Economy Standards Work</B>,<br>
 by Michael Sykuta <br>
<I>Policy Study</I> No. 133, Center for the Study of American Business<hr>
<p>
Michael Sykuta, a Research Associate and lecturer in business administration at the Joseph M. Katz Graduate School of Business, argues that automobile fuel economy standards do not work. According to Sykuta, corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards have not achieved their original objective of reducing gasoline consumption. He finds that the United States consumed 40 percent more gasoline than when the CAFE law was passed in 1975. His findings offers evidence that  freeze, if not a repeal, of CAFE standards should take place. Proponents of CAFE regulation argue that standards must be increased to further reduce the consumption of gasoline and its environmental side-effects. However, Sykuta found the following: average passenger vehicles on the road today are 59 percent more fuel efficient than the average cars of 1975 and continued through 1982, not because of CAFE standards, but because changes in product designed that began prior to 1975 as a response to prevailing market forces; the average fuel economy of the total U.S. fleet continued to rise after 1982 as the older and less efficient cars were slowly replaced with the newer more efficient cars, however the average fuel economy of all cars has leveled off in recent years; and, CAFE regulations have not achieved the goal of reducing American consumption of foreign oil. Sykuta reasons from his data covering a 44-year period (1951-1994), that average gasoline consumption per car is most significantly related to the price of gasoline and to the average fuel efficiency of the total U.S. fleet, not just new cars. He argues that, at least through 1982, the price of gasoline, not CAFE standards themselves, is the key determinant of average fuel efficiency. He concludes that federal government attempts to reduce gasoline consumption with a mandated fuel-economy standard shows no sign having an impact on the amount of gasoline consumed on a per vehicle basis. Overall, Cafe regulations have only served to create additional bureaucratic burdens on automobile ma
nufacturers. 22 pp.  CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington University, Campus Box 1208, St. Louis, MO 63130-4899, 314/935-5630, fax 314/935-5688.

<b>Community-Run Fisheries: Avoiding the "Tragedy of the Commons"</b>, <br>
 by Donald Leal<br>
<I>PERC Policy Series</I> No. 7, PERC<hr>
<p>
Donald Leal, PERC Senior Associate, discusses how coastal communities can avoid overfishing. He presents several cases where fishing territories have been effectively protected and fish populations preserved through community-run fisheries. Leal mentions early native Alaskan fisheries, and today's ZECs (zones of controlled exploitation) in Quebec. In the examples, he shows that fishing areas can be protected from overfishing with minimal government involvement. Citing studies on well-managed, commonly-owned property, he illustrates that well-defined boundaries, a strong community tradition, and absence of government interference can preserve resources and avoid the "tragedy of the commons." He concludes that government has failed to regulate fishing successfully, and that a self-regulated fishery is an idea whose time has come. 27 pp. CONTACT: Political Economy Research Center, 502 S. 19th Avenue, Suite 211, Bozeman, MT  59715, 406/587-9591, fax 406/586-7555.

<b><a href=" /heritage/library/categories/crimelaw/bg1097.html">How State and Local Officials Can Combat Violent Juvenile Crime</a></b>,<br>
 by James Wootton and Robert Heck<br>
<I>State Backgrounder</I> No. 1097/S, The Heritage Foundation<hr>
<p>
James Wootton, President of the Safe Streets Alliance, and Robert Heck, a former Justice Department official, have prepared a study on how state and local officials can fight violent juvenile crime. Wootton and Heck argue that a high-tech approach might be the answer. six percent of hard-core juvenile offenders, or "superpredators" commit up to 63 percent of all violent juvenile crime. According to Wootton and Heck, state and local law enforcement officials should build computerized case files on these criminals and make the information available to every public agency that deals with youth-police, prosecutors, courts, parole officers, schools and social workers. There is already a similar system set up in more than 150 communities across the United States and Canada called Serious Habitual Offender Comprehensive Action Program (SHOCAP). SHOCAP enables state and local law enforcement officials to identify, target, arrest, and incarcerate violent teenage criminals. Wootton and Heck mention that Congress can aid efforts to fight juvenile crime with such legislation as the Violent and Repeat Juvenille Offender Act of 1996, and the Violent Youth Predator Act of 1996. Ultimately, they argue, violent juvenile crime must be fought by smart, tough and tenacious officials at the state and local level with the most efficient and sophisticated resources for tracking the violent habitual offender.  17 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto:Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org,</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.heritage.org">http://www.heritage.org</a>.

<b>Legal Services for the Poor: Is Federal Support Necessary?</b><br>
 by David Wilkinson<br>
<I>Alternatives in Philanthropy</I>, Capital Research Center<hr>
<P>
David Wikenson, former Utah Attorney General, and the first Inspector General of the Legal Services Corporation (1989-91), questions whether the federal government should spend $283 million to fund legal services. The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) is a federally funded agency designed to support legal services organizations that serve the poor. Conservative critics of LSC have charged that LSC funds are improperly used to challenge electoral redistricting plans, represent illegal aliens and drug dealers, and bring class action lawsuits against laws made by elected officials. Liberal supporters of LSC argue that LSC-funded organizations spend most of their resources representing the poor in routine legal cases such as land-lord-tenant disputes. Whatever the case may be, Wilkinson argues, there are adequate private and non-federal resources currently available to meet the legal needs of the poor. Legal service providers receiving LSC funds also receive at least $324 million from private and other public sources. Furthermore, there are an additional 1,350 providers of legal services to the needy who receive no government funding and whose budgets total over $200 million. On top of that there are 400,000 to 600,000 lawyers who perform an estimated 24,000,000 hours of pro bono work each year valued at $3.3 billion. Wilkenson concludes that if Congress is serious about balancing the budget and reducing the role of the federal government, then it may want to reconsider the next LSC budget. If LSC were abolished, there would still be at least a half billion dollars available each year for legal services for the needy. 5 pp.  CONTACT: Capital Research Center, 727 15th Street, N.W., 8th Floor, Washington, DC 20005, 202/393-2600, fax 202/393-2626.

<b>Factories Behind Bars</b>,<br>
 by Morgan Reynolds<br>
<I>Policy Report</I> No. 206, <hr>
<P>
Morgan Reynolds, NCPA Senior Fellow, calls for putting prisoners to work. Currently there are unnecessary legal restrictions keeping tens of thousands of prisoners from doing productive work behind bars. Reynolds proposes repealing the laws that restrict trade in prison-made goods. He also proposes recruiting private-sector businesses to supply jobs, once the restrictive laws are abolished. America's prison population is projected to grow to 1.6 million in the next decade. Only about half of all prisoners do any kind of work at all and most of that is part-time work on prison upkeep. According to Reynolds, it should be possible to create jobs for one of every four prisoners during the next five to ten years. If just 60 percent of prisoner earnings were allocated to compensating taxpayers, this would save about $2.4 billion annually, or slightly less than 10 percent of the cost of prison support. Reynolds points out that there is no reason why prisoners shouldn't help to pay for their own upkeep instead of having taxpayers pay for it all. Beyond taxpayer relief, productive work for prisoners would alleviate idleness in prison life, and increase the likelihood of responsible behavior upon the prisoners release. 29 pp. CONTACT: National Center for Policy Analysis, 12655 N.

<b>Reforming Public Education in Wisconsin: Moving from Bureaucracy to Accountability</b>,<br>
 by James Cibulka<br>
<I>Report</I> Vol. 9, No. 7, Wisconsin Policy Research Institute<hr>
<p>
James Cibulka, Professor and Chair of the Department of Education Policy, Planning and Administration at the University of Maryland, examines what has happened to educational reform in Wisconsin. He finds that Wisconsin's Department of Public Instruction (DPI) is still bogged down with outdated "command-and-control" principles. He points out that while private sector organizations have undergone a "management revolution" achieving much greater efficiency, DPI has not reorganized itself to promote high student performance, local initiative, and accountability for high performance at all levels. Cibulka offers recommendations for improving DPI in three general areas: 1) greater regulatory flexibility; 2) improving accountability policies; and 3) a new approach to state leadership and a state-level partnership. He concludes that a new focus on high performance can be achieved within a system with a tradition of strong local initiative. He calls for a new model for education administration that is a state-local partnership. 23 pp. CONTACT: Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, 3107 North Shepard Avenue, Milwaukee, WI  53211, 414/963-0600, fax 414/963-4230.

<b>A National Survey of Americans' Attitudes Toward Education and School Reform</b><br>

The Center for Education Reform (CER) has conducted a nationwide poll of Americans' attitudes toward education and school reform. The poll shows 70 percent of the public supports school choice options, including tax-funded scholarships to allow poor parents to send their children to private, public or parochial school of their choice. This survey confirms data released earlier this year by the Public Agenda Foundation and disputes the results of a recent National Education Association (NEA) poll which claims to show public opposition to school choice and support for a federal role in education. CER's poll asked what size the role of the federal government should play in education. 50 percent of the respondents said "minor," and 24 percent said "no role." Overall, 93 percent of the respondent said that public schools need to be improved.  9 pp. CONTACT: The Center for Education Reform, 1001 Connecticut Avenue, N.W., Suite 920, Washington, DC  20036, 202/822-9000, fax 202/822-5077.

<b>1996 Georgia High School Report Card for Parents</b><br>

The Georgia Public Policy Foundation (GPPF) has released a "report card" on Georgia public schools. It provides a ranking of every school district in the state. This study attempts do the following: a) analyze the issues that GPPF thinks Georgia parents care most about; b) reduce the available statistical information to a concise and understandable form; c) isolate data from Georgia's public high schools only; and d) issue a publication that is accessible and easily comprehensible to the state's general population. The criteria that they used for ranking the schools were the Test of Achievement and Proficiency (TAP), Scholastic Assessment Test (SAT) scores, the percentage of students completing a college preparatory curriculum (versus a less vigorous curriculum), dropout rates, and, the number of weapons violations per 100 students. GPPF argues that parents are entitled to know about the quality of their children's schools. For the majority of parents, assessing the quality of a school is a mystery shrouded in unfamiliar terms and endless data. GPPF says that this report should be used to open dialogues between parents, teachers, administrators, government officials, and civic organizations. 35 pp. CONTACT: Georgia Public Policy Foundation, 2900 Chamblee-Tucker Road, Building Six, Atlanta, GA 30341-4128, 770/455-7600, fax 770/455-4355.

<b>The End of Welfare: Fighting Poverty in the Civil Society</b>,<br>
 by Michael Tanner<br>
Cato Institute<hr>
<p>
Michael Tanner, Director of Health and Welfare Studies at the Cato Institute, discusses the corrosive effect of U.S. welfare policy, despite its good intentions. He points out that since the start of the War on Poverty in 1965, the federal and state governments have spent more than $5.4 trillion to end poverty. Despite the enormity of this 'investment' the result has been, primarily, more poverty. He argues that our welfare system is unfair to all. Taxpayers must pay the bill for failed programs. Society is hurt when its mediating institutions of community, church and family are increasingly pushed aside. Most of all, argues Tanner, the poor are hurt with welfare by being trapped in a system that destroys opportunity for themselves and destroys hope for their children. Welfare should be judged on its results, not its intentions. Despite the acknowledgment from all sides that the system has failed, Tanner argues, both liberals and conservatives, continue to believe that government can solve the problem of poverty. Tanner maintains that the answer to poverty does not lie with government. He argues that a new paradigm to fight poverty must be based on civil society instead of government or political society. Civil society, "while stressing self-reliance and individual initiative, would also provide a vigorous network of private, localized, nonbureaucratic charities that are far more capable than is government of helping those people who need temporary assistance." Tanner also criticizes the recent welfare reform legislation. According to him, welfare cannot be reformed, and instead, should be ended. He explains why liberal and conservative welfare reform won't work, and he elaborates on how civil society can replace welfare. This book also includes an appendix listing and describing major welfare programs. 225 pp.  CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200, fax 202/842-3490, e-mail <a href="mailto: cato@cato.org ">cato@cato.org</a>, Internet <a href=" http://www.

<b>The Tenth Amendment: The Promise of Liberty: Strategies to Restore the Balance of Power Between the Federal and State Governments</b>
American Legislative Exchange Council<hr>
<p>
With this paper, the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), has put forth strategies to restore the balance of power between the federal and state governments that is implied with the Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. In October of 1995, ALEC and other organizations, held a national federalism summit to look at ways to restore the Tenth Amendment. The result of the summit was four proposals which, they believe, merit further consideration. 1) Set up a mechanism to provide the people of the states, through their legislatures, the power to require Congress to reconsider laws or regulations that interfere with state authority. 2) Set up a mechanism that would allow the states to propose specific amendments to the U.S. Constitution subject to ratification by the United States Congress. 3) Set up statutory remedies and/or constitutional reforms to address the problems of conditions attached to federal spending grants, regulations and mandates. 4) Passage of a federalism act to enhance the political safeguards and give states a more effective voice in congressional deliberations. For each of these proposals ALEC recommends the following: 1) The National Government of the People Amendment, which would allow state legislatures to repeal intrusive federal legislation and regulations; 2) The States' Initiative, which would empower the People through their state legislature to ratify constitutional amendments that enjoy broad support but that Congress has failed to propose; 3) The Accountability in Government Initiative, which would end the three intrusive federal practices of regulatory mandates, unfunded mandates, and the imposition of impermissible conditions on federal spending grants; and 4) The Federalism Act, which would directly address discrete aspects of the current imbalance between the federal and state governments. 17 pp. CONTACT: American Legislative Exchange Council, 910 17th Street, N.W., 5th floor, Washington, DC  20006, 202/466-3800, fax 202/466-3801.

<b><a href="/heritage/library/categories/govern/bg1094.html">From Meany to Sweeney: Labor's Leftward Tilt</a></b>,<br>
 by Ken Weinstein and August Stofferahn<br>
<I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1094, The Heritage Foundation<hr>
<P>
Ken Weinstein, Director of the Government Reform Project at The Heritage Foundation, and August Stofferahn, Research Assistant at the Government Reform Project, examine organized labor's use of compulsory membership dues to finance their leadership's political agenda. An activist labor movement was a major force in the last election, and may be the most significant new force in American politics. However, Weinstein and Stofferahn point out, much of labor's new agenda has nothing to do with workplace issues, is not generally supported among rank-and-file union members, and is outside of the mainstream of American politics. In the past few decades, organized labor has moved from a relatively centrist political force into a powerful, high-spending lobby for liberal special interests and big government. Weinstein and Stofferahn document labor's move to the left. They illustrate how organized labor has come to be dominated by government employee unions, instead of the traditional industry-based unions. Specifically, they show how the AFL-CIO have drastically departed from American Federation of Labor founder, Samuel Gompers', rule of separating labor from partisan politics. Organized labor has recently taken stances on issues that have nothing to do with collective bargaining and workplace conditions. For example, in 1995 the Director of Community Services for the AFL-CIO led a campaign to force the Boy Scouts of America to include homosexuals and atheists. Organized labor leadership has also taken stances on abortion, racial and gender preferences, welfare and the federal budget. This paper also goes into detail about the epitome of labor's leftward shift and blatant political partisanship, the National Education Association. In their conclusion, Weinstein and Stofferahn, point out that politicking and other non-collective bargaining activities cost the average union member hundreds of dollars per year in dues. They argue that unions should not finance their political activities with compulsory membership dues. The
re is judicial precedent from the 1988 Supreme Court Case <I>Communication Workers of America v. Beck</I>, that declared that union members are entitled to a refund of the portion of their dues used for purposes other than collective bargaining, contract administration, and grievance adjustment. 12 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto:Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org,</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.heritage.org">http://www.heritage.org</a>.

<b>What About the Religious Left? Politics  Motivates and Bankrolls The Interfaith Alliance, Americans United Works to Keep Religion Out of Public Square</b>
<I>Organization Trends</I>, Capital Research Center<hr>
<p>
In recent years the mainstream media has thoroughly covered the "religious right," often times generously quoting those eager to bash them, and implying that their rising influence may corrupt the American political system. <I>Organization Trends</I> points out that left-leaning churches and religious leaders have been involved in American politics long before there was a Christian Coalition. This issue focuses on two groups, the Interfaith Alliance (TIA), and Americans United for the Separation of Church and State. Calling itself a "faith-based" group, TIA engages in the same activism with similar methods as the Christian Coalition. The Interfaith Alliance distributed the same type of voter guides that earned the Christian Coalition criticism for excessive religious influence. Yet, TIA's guides, which ranked liberal candidates better, caused no such outcry. This 501(c)(4) organization was started with Democratic party money, and a look at the organization's leadership and activities uncovers its position clearly within the left of the political and cultural spectrum. This issue also covers the activities of another group having to do with religion and public life, Americans United for the Separation of Church and State. TIA, a self-proclaimed "mainstream faith-based" group, is ironically allied with this group that is dedicated to eradicating the public expression of religion. In September, Americans United launched a national campaign to deter churches from distributing Christian Coalition voter guides, and warning churches that doing so could threaten their tax-exempt status. The issue concludes by observing that TIA apparently has no agenda of its own, other than bashing the Christian Coalition. TIA is most often quoted in the media as a "religious" organization denouncing the Christian Coalition. The author suggests that the liberal left only has a use for TIA because of the activism of religious conservatives. 6 pp. CONTACT: Capital Research Center, 727 15th Street, N.W., 8th Floor, Washington, DC 20005,

<b>The Adoption Option: Compassion that Works</b>,<br>
 by Ken Connor and Camille Godwin<br>
<I>Outside the Lines</I> No. 7, Foundation for Florida's Future<hr>
<p>
Ken Connor, Chairman of the Board of Care Net, which represents the largest network of crisis pregnancy centers in North America, and Camille Godwin, an attorney in Tallahassee, FL, promote the option of adoption in the situation of a "crisis pregnancy." They argue that adoption can be a "win-win" situation for the people affected. The child gains a loving, stable and secure home, the adopting parents win by becoming parents of the child for whom they have longed, and the biological parents obtain the relief from the burdens of an unexpected or unwanted child. Connor and Godwin say that this makes it in the public interest to encourage and facilitate the adoption process. They discuss the current adoption procedures in the State of Florida, the obstacles to adoption, and the disadvantages of foster care. Connor and Godwin put forth several legislative and public policy suggestions to improve the adoption and foster care system: streamline judicial proceedings, increase access to information about adoption, reduce the financial obstacles for prospective parents, remove race as an obstacle to adoption, promote community-based responses to adoption and foster care issues, and encourage employer-based initiatives to promote adoption. They conclude by arguing that adoption must become a priority public policy issue. 14 pp.  CONTACT: Foundation for Florida's Future, 3399 Ponce de Leon Boulevard, P.O.

<dd>The cover story of this issue, <a href="/heritage/p_review/nov96/shokraii.html">"Free at Last: Black America Signs Up for School Choice</a>," by Nina Shokraii, examines the growing support for school choice amongst African-Americans. Most black political leaders actively oppose vouchers and charter schools, yet their constituents are looking more and more to options other than decaying public schools ---which have a disasterous record of teaching black children. Shokraii, Director of Outreach Programs at the Institute for Justice, documents the school choice movements in black communities in Milwaukee and Cleveland, and charter school movements in California and Michigan. It is quite evident that standards, discipline, and parental involvement of private or charter schools are bringing more black parents to fight for schools choice. Shokraii concludes that school choice and charter schools are becoming the civil rights movement of the 1990s.

Novemember 1996<hr><p>
<dd>
A notable article in this month's issue of <I>Crisis</I> discusses the bad economics of the pastoral letter of America's Catholic bishops, <I>Economic Justice for All</I>. Michael Joyce, President and CEO of the Bradley Foundation, contrasts <I>Economic Justice for All</I> with Pope John Paul II's <I>Centesimus Annus</I>. At the core of the comparison is how the respective writings proscribe ways to help those in need. Joyce points out the bishop's pastoral has much to say about the needy, but nothing to say to them. The letter calls for "an economy that truly respects persons," and even proposes measures to be taken by government as specific as a Targeted Jobs Tax Credit Act. It calls for reforming social sytems in order to secure dignity for the needy, yet it never lists an action or task for the needy themselves. Joyce argues that <I>Centesimus Annus</I> cannot be read without a clear sense that the human person, made in the image and likeness of God, is not quite so subordinate. While the Pope acknowledges that there is a need for political, economic, social, and cultural commitment to the poor, he maintains that the decisive commitment must be made within the heart and conscience of the human person and not depend on asking government or other institution to solve the problem. 60 pp.  CONTACT: 800/852-9962.

<B>Competitive Enterprise Institute</B><HR>

<P>
In October, the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) filed a First Amendment challenge to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms' (ATF) ban on statements concerning the cardiovascular benefits of moderate drinking on alcoholic beverage labels and advertisements. A substantial body of research has shown that moderate alcohol consumption significantly reduces the risk of heart disease, the leading cause of death in adults. While these findings are now widely accepted and have been incorporated into the federal government's new edition of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, ATF still prohibits their inclusion on products or advertisements.
<p>
CEI had petitioned ATF in 1995 to allow such statements, and included the following suggested language: "There is significant evidence that moderate consumption of alcoholic beverages may reduce the risk of heart disease." ATF did not respond to the petition. Consumer Alert, a non-profit consumer advocacy group with an interest in the free flow of information to its members and a supporter of the CEI petition, is also a party.
<p>
CEI is relying on an extensive body of Supreme Court precedent protecting so-called commercial speech. Most recently, two Court decisions, <I>Rubin v. Coors Brewing Co.</i> and <I>44 Liquormart Inc. v. Rhode Island</I>, held that information on alcoholic beverage labels and ads is protected by the First Amendment against government restrictions.

<b>Flooding Farm Reveals Government Double Standard</b>
<p>
The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) is guilty of using double standards when it comes to its dealings with small farmer Roy James, according to Defenders. Mr. James's farm abuts the Pocosin Lakes National Wildlife Refuge (Tyrrell County, North Carolina). A drainage problem in the refuge causes the farm to flood. Due to the flooding, Mr. James loses at least 40% of the productivity of his farm every year, and suffers further losses from erosion and the cost of paying to have the water pumped off the land. FWS admits to causing the flooding, but simply refuses to resolve the problem.
<p>
Mr. James offered to exchange land with FWS, but FWS declined because the land "does not have significant enough wildlife values to be advantageous." So after two years of flooding, Mr. James had the U.S. Soil Conservation Service draw up specifications for a dike. He built the dike with some fill from the refuge land. Ironically, when the government's land was physically invaded, FWS took immediate action, threatening to sue Mr. James for damages. In fact, Mr. James was forced to compensate the federal government in order to avoid litigation, but has yet to receive a dime from the government for its years-long physical invasion of his land. Defenders is now representing Mr. James seeking damages on his behalf.
<p>
<b>Last Developer in Is a "Rotten Egg"</b>
<p>
A wetland designation by the Army Corps of Engineers has derailed investment-backed expectations of the owners of industrial-zoned property in Centerville, Utah, leaving a handful of property owners with no economically beneficial or productive use of their property.
<p>
The land at issue was purchased by several investors in the early 1970's. The local government zoned the area industrial and encouraged its development as an industrial park. By pooling their resources, the landowners built public roads and other infrastructure, and began to develop their individual lots. After half the lots were develop and Mr. Smith began developing his lot, the Army Corps ordered him to cease because the land, according the government, is now "wetland."
<p>
In fact, however, Mr. Smith's dry land is only wet when rain water runs off the adjacent developed parcels onto his undeveloped parcel. Now that the parcel has been declared a wetland, Mr. Smith faces the unfair reality of not being able to make any beneficial or productive us of his property.
<p>
<b>Sales Contract Canceled Due to Government Interference</b>
<p>
Anyone who still claims that wetland designations do not diminish land values should look closely at the case of <I>Robbins v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers</I>. In 1976, Mrs. Robbins purchased as investment property, 34 acres in Paris, Tennessee to fund her retirement. The land is zoned commercial and lies along the main highway leading to the "Lands Between the Lakes" Park, a popular national tourist destination. Following her husband's death in 1994, Mrs. Robbins decided to sell the property. She had no problem finding a buyer, and the parties executed a sales contract. The purchaser deposited one third of the sales price in escrow to secure the purchase.
<p>
Three days later, the buyer canceled the contract because unbeknownst to Mrs. Robbins, the land is now deemed "wetland." In spite of the fact that the property is surrounded by commercial building and directly abuts a highway, the U.S. Army Corps determined that the property exhibits the characteristics of federal jurisdictional wetlands.
<p>
Mrs. Robbins has asked Defenders to seek compensation for the property on her behalf. Her just compensation claim is based on the fact that the federal wetlands delineation interfered with her contract for sale, reduced the property to nominal value, and destroyed its development potential and marketability.
<p>
<b>97% Open Space Is Not Enough</b>
<p>
Teton County, Wyoming is 97% public land, consisting of Yellowstone National Park, Grand Teton National Park and state lands. Only 3% of the county is privately owned: 1.5% is held by large ranchers and 1.5% (the only developable land in the county) is held by landowners whose families typically hold the land to subdivide for future generations.
<p>
Michael Shidner is one of those property owners. He owns 35 acres, which he planned to divide three ways. Under the latest Teton county comprehensive plan, however, Mr. Shidner will  not be able to subdivide unless he places a conservation easement over 70% of his property. In addition, he must agree to cluster the homes, since the area is considered winter habitat for endangered species.
<p>
Defenders will argue in a lawsuit that the permit conditions violate the Supreme Court's holding in <I>Dolan v. City of Tigard</I>, which requires conditions to be "roughly proportional" to the burden created by the proposed us of the property. The permit condition faced by Mr. Shidner far exceed the burden that a few homes would create in a county that is already 97% open space.

<b>Religious School Choice in Vermont</b>
<p>
On August 26, 1996, IJ filed a lawsuit on behalf of the Chittenden Town School District against the Vermont Department of Education and its commissioner. The Department had denied general state aid to the District because it was prepared to pay tuition to a religious high school among other schools its students attend. (Vermont towns that have no public high schools send all their students to whatever school, public or private, their parents choose.) The issue is whether religious schools can be included in the tuition program.
<p>
The District withdrew its preliminary injunction request and agreed not to pay tuition to the religious schools until it received a favorable ruling from the Superior Court. The Department agreed to send the aid to the District and expedited discovery in the case. The judge stated he would issue his ruling quickly after discovery and briefings were complete. IJ hopes for a declaratory judgment in the District's favor this fall.

<b>Landmark Continues Milwaukee School Choice Defense</b>
<p>
Representing State Representative Annette "Polly" Williams and low income families, Landmark Legal Foundation continues its defense of the Amended Milwaukee Parental Choice Program. The amended program allows families access to religious private schools under the nation's first school choice plan, which Landmark successfully defended in 1991 and 1992. Landmark, joined by other school choice advocates, recently filed papers asking a Wisconsin state court judge to declare the amended program constitutional. The judge likely will rule against the religious school access provision, however, and the issue is certain to be determined in the Wisconsin Supreme Court, hopefully prior to the 1997-98 school year.

<b>Landmark to Appeal Ruling on State-Created Insurance Company</b>
<p>
Landmark Legal Foundation will ask the Missouri Supreme Court to declare unconstitutional a Missouri state-subsidized insurance company. Representing Casualty Reciprocal Exchange ("CRE"), Landmark will tell the Court that the Missouri Employers Mutual Insurance Company ("MEMIC") also unfairly competes with private insurance companies and is a risk to taxpayers because of important financial reserve requirements from which it was exempted by Missouri Director of Insurance Jay Angoff, also a defendant in the lawsuit.
<p>
MEMIC, in its most recent quarterly report, disclosed that it underestimated its 1995 year-end losses and related expenses by more than $11,000,000. 
<p>
MEMIC was created in 1993 by the legislature, which provided MEMIC a $5 million taxpayer-financed loan for the company's startup capital. MEMIC also was given the authority to revenue bonds for additional capitalization -- both in direct violation of Missouri's Constitutional provisions prohibiting the use of state funds for private loans and investment.

<b><i>Adarand</i> Set for Oral Argument</b>
<p>
The landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in <I>Adarand Constructors, Inc v. Pena</I>, won by MSLF on June 12, 1995, has reached the final stage before the Colorado federal district court. The Supreme Court returned the case to Colorado after it "alter(ed) the playing field" regarding the standard to be used in reviewing race-based decision making by Congress. Overturning two earlier decisions, the Supreme Court held that the "strict scrutiny" standard applies to Congress. With the completion of briefing by both parties, the case is scheduled for oral argument on December 20.

<b>Michigan Property Owners Seek Supreme Court Review</b>
<p>
Two lake front property owners in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan have asked the Supreme Court to review a lower court holding left undisturbed by the 7-7 split of the entire U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. In <I>Stupak-Thrall, et al. v. United States of America, et al</I>., the U.S. Forest Service (USFS) denied two lake front property owners the right to use the entire surface of Crooked Lake, as Michigan law permits them. This despite the language of applicable federal law that "valid existing rights" are protected. On behalf of the property owners, who MSLF have represented since they first filed their lawsuit, MSLF sought Supreme Court review asserting that the USFS has rendered the "valid existing rights" language "meaningless" and that the federal government's use of the Property Clause to regulate private property is contrary to Supreme Court precedent.
<p>
<b>Babbitt's Park Service Goes Back to Drawing Board</b>
<p>
After MSLF's victory on behalf of commercial climbers, the National Park Service (NPS) has obtained the permission of the Wyoming federal district court to return to the drawing board to determine how it may implement President Clinton's Executive Order regarding regulating federal land for Native American religions. MSLF had obtained a preliminary injunction preventing the NPS from closing Devils Tower in northeastern Wyoming to commercial climbing. Regardless of the NPS decision, MSLF will return to court to seek damages for its client and to prevent other Establishment Clause violations within the Monument.

<b>Clinton Plan to Empty Idaho Reservoir in Jeopardy</b>
<p>
The National Marine and Fisheries Service plan to empty a reservoir in northern Idaho, ostensibly to "save" the salmon was dealt a blow in federal district court when the court requested further briefing on whether the specific statute creating the dam controlled over the general Endangered Species Act (ESA). The controversy is in Clearwater County, Idaho, where the government is seeking to drain a reservoir created by Congress for power generation, recreation, and timber transport. The government says those purposes are subservient to the command of the ESA.

<p>
<b>Local Law Enforcement Conscripted into Federal Service</b>
<p>
Named after former White House Press Secretary James Brady, the Brady Act requires a five-day waiting period for handgun purchases and background checks on gun buyers during that period to determine whether there is any legal reason to stop the sale. Theoretically, this law addresses the salutary purpose of keeping guns out of the hands of would-be robbers and murderers. But in reality, the Brady Act goes far beyond that purpose and conscripts local law enforcement officers into federal service, forcing them to compromise their local responsibilities by engaging in time-consuming, costly, and futile paper work for the federal government. What is more, no financial reimbursement is made.
<p>
Background checks under Brady go beyond felons. The law also applies to anyone who may be "otherwise prohibited by law from buying a gun." That means local sheriffs and chiefs of police must search through medical records to determine if a gun buyer has ever been committed to a mental institution or is an illegal drug user who has evaded arrest. Law enforcement officers must also check the records of fugitives, dishonorable military discharges and expatriate citizens. Civil court records must also be checked for restraining orders imposed on spouses in domestic relations cases. As if impressing local officers into federal service was not enough, the law includes an unconscionable provision that could subject them to fine or imprisonment or both for failing to make a "reasonable effort" to complete the work for the federal government.
<p>
The Brady Act's unfunded mandate was the "last straw" for Ravalli County, Montana, Sheriff Jay Printz and Graham County, Arizona, Sheriff Richard Mack, both of whom are being shut into their offices and tied to their desks to complete the background check requirement. These law enforcement officials would much rather devote their resources to protecting the citizens than doing bureaucratic paper work-of questionable efficacy-for the federal government.
<p>
Both Sheriffs Printz and Mack sued and won trial court rulings striking down that position of the Brady Act requiring background checks. In both cases, the lower courts agreed that the law illegally commandeered local officials for a federal program. However, the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed those decisions ruling that the Brady law's background check requirement is constitutional and its intrusion upon state sovereignty minimal. The sheriffs' appeals are now before the U.S. Supreme Court. Pacific Legal Foundation is arguing that the federal government has no constitutional authority to force local law enforcement officers to carry out a mandate that materially impairs their ability to serve the local citizens whom they were hired to protect.
<p>
<b>Farmers Forced to Advertise Competitor's Products</b><br>
<I>Glickman v. Wileman Brothers & Elliot, Inc.</I>
<p>
According to Thomas Jefferson, "to compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the propagation of ideas which he disbelieves is sinful and tyrannical." So why does Wileman Brothers & Elliot, Inc., a peach and nectarine grower in California, pay lots of hard-earned money to help pay for a generic advertising message that says its competitors' fruits are as good as its own? Because the federal government is forcing this grower to.
<p>
Government "marketing boards," which essentially are agriculture cartels made up of farmers appointed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, have vast discretionary powers and can punish farmers who don't abide by their edicts. One of the boards' dubious functions is to force farmers to subsidize generic advertisements that extol the virtues of certain commodities in general. Remember the dancing raisins, "Got Milk?" and "It's the Cheese" ads? Such campaigns were financed through mandatory fees paid by individual growers. According to <i>Forbes</i> magazine, commodity boards for agricultural products have raked in over $750 million a year from U.S. farmers through coerced contributions. (The government pays out an additional $90 million of taxpayers' money for overseas promotions.) In California, about 50 such boards collect some $125 million from growers yearly.
<p>
Where do government bureaucrats get the idea in the first place that it is their job to tell business owners how to promote their own products? Forcing producers of agricultural commodities to pay for generic commercial ads is antithetical to the principle of free market enterprise. It is also a blatant violation of the constitutional free speech right not to be forced to pay for messages with which one disagrees. This is why Pacific Legal Foundation is helping Wileman Brothers & Elliot challenge the government's mandatory fee program in the U.S. Supreme Court. Pursuant to federal regulations and marketing orders, Wileman must pay an assessment for a generic advertising program with which it disagrees. Moreover, the payments reduce Wileman's ability to pursue its own individual advertising program.
<p>
PLF argued to the U.S. Supreme Court last week to strike down the government's "marketing order" that assesses small farmers to pay for government-concocted advertising programs.

<b>Supreme Court Hears Oral Arguments in Parents' Rights Case</b>
<p>
The Supreme Court has heard oral arguments in a case that could have a considerable impact on parents' rights. In <i>M.L.B. v. S.L.J.</i>, the court will consider whether a state court can condition an appeal for the termination of parents' rights on their ability to pay court costs in excess of $2,000.00.
<p>
In the case, a Mississippi lower court terminated a mother's parental rights to her 7 and 9-year-old children. She appealed the case to the state Supreme Court but could not afford to pay the costs involved. The court refused to waive the fee and dismissed her case. The Supreme Court must now decide if parents' rights are, in fact, fundamental liberties.

<b>California's Policy Restricting Employees' Religious Expression Unconstitutional Says Ninth Circuit</b>
<p>
The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has ruled that a California state agency's policy against religious advocacy and display of religious artifacts is unconstitutional. The ruling reverses the finding of the lower court.
<p>
The Rutherford Institute represented state employee Monte Tucker, who placed "By Monte Tucker, SOTLJC" in a computer screen program he designed. The acronym stands for "Servant of the Lord Jesus Christ." Tucker's supervisor threatened him with suspension if he refused to remove the acronym. The department then issued a policy forbidding religious advocacy during work hours and storage or display of any religious artifacts except n closed offices.

<b>The Rutherford Institute to File Class Action Suit Against Dept. Of Health 
and Human Services</b>
<p>
The Rutherford Institute has filed a class action lawsuit against Donna Shalala and the Department of Health and Human Services for allowing county officials to profit from depriving disabled foster children of their rightful monies.
<p>
The suit alleges that the Department of Health and Human Service has violated federal law by failing to follow the Social Security Act's mandates to ensure that foster children receive their rightful benefits. This policy has in essence encouraged Contra Costa County to prevent handicapped children from being adopted in order to keep funds intended for foster children. The suit claims that he violations occurring in Contra Costa County are indicative of foster care in other counties nationwide.

<b>Commercial Free Speech Defended</b>
<p>
In <I>AAA v. Kessler</I>, a lawsuit brought by a consortium of advertising groups challenging the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) regulations of tobacco advertising, WLF filed a brief arguing that the regulations imposed by FDA violated the First Amendment rights of advertisers and the adult public. FDA's regulations, announced on August 28, 1996, and set to begin taking effect in early 1997, impose sweeping restrictions on tobacco advertising, including: (1) requiring black and white, text-only advertisements in all media, i.e., billboards, print media, point of purchase, and direct mail, except on those locations or print media that are "adult-only;" (2) prohibiting billboards within 1000 feet of schools or play areas, effectively eliminating all billboards in urban areas; and (3) banning the use of any tobacco brand name in sponsoring any cultural, sporting, or musical event, and on all types of secondary product, such as t-shirts, umbrellas, lighters, etc. WLF argued that the regulations are unlawful because the government has available to it several obvious and non-speech related methods to attack the problem of youth smoking. Moreover, even if some restrictions on advertising could be lawful, the broad and sweeping restrictions imposed by FDA are not "narrowly tailored" to the harm they were intended to address and would primarily restrict the free speech rights of adults. FDA cannot properly, for example, ban the use of tobacco brand names to sponsor all sporting or cultural events when many of these events have minimal, if any, children in attendance. WLF's clients on the brief include race car drivers, Mario Andretti, Don Garlits, Al Unser, Rusty Wallace, and Cale Yarborough, U.S. Representatives Richard Burr, Cass Ballenger, Howard Coble, and David Funderburk, and U.S. Senator Lauch Faircloth.
<p>
<b>Excessive Antitrust Penalty Challenged</b>
<p>
WLF filed a brief with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit arguing that a $10 million fine imposed on a family-owned bakery company that kept its bread prices below the national average during the relevant period should be set aside as grossly excessive and unlawful. In <i>United States v. Mrs. Baird's Bakeries</i>, the evidence was undisputed that, during the time of the alleged pricing conspiracy, Mrs. Baird's bakery held prices steady and, indeed, even reduced its prices on several occasions. Despite this, Texas federal Judge Jerry Buchmeyer imposed the maximum statutory fine, one of the largest antitrust fines in U.S. history. Mrs. Baird's is now in bankruptcy. In its brief, WLF argued that there was little evidence of price fixing, and that the district court misapplied the Sentencing Guidelines in imposing the maximum fine.
<p>
<b>Objection to HUD's Rulemaking</b>
<p>
WLF filed formal comments with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) requesting that HUD immediately rescind an interim rule that would abolish the right of respondents in fair housing complaint proceedings to obtain discovery from witnesses and the complaining party. The interim rule is procedurally and substantively defective on a number of grounds. HUD flagrantly violated the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) and its own policy by not publishing the interim rule as a proposed rule for public comment. WLF also took strong objection to HUD's primary rationale for abolishing rights of respondents, namely that it would expedite the investigation process. WLF research discovered that the main cause of delay is <i>agency</i> inefficiency; it takes HUD, on average, 53 days from the time a housing complaint is filed until HUD even <i>begins</i> an investigation.

<b><i>Consumer Product Safety Commision Monitor</i> Launched by Consumer Alert </b>
<p>
Consumer Alert has launched a new publication called <i>CPSC Monitor</i>. It is a series of fax newsletters covering the activities of the Consumer Product Safety Commision (CPSC). The purpose of the series is to educate the public about CPSC actions that negatively impact consumers. With this publication, Consumer Alert hopes to scrutinize CPSC which has greatly expanded its original mission under the Clinton Administration. CPSC has deviated from its original mission with more recalls that have needlessly scared consumers and increased the cost of consumer products.

<b>Lecture Series to Examine the Impact of Religious Conviction on Politics</b>
<p>

The Foreign Policy Institute, Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) and the Ethics and Public Policy Center will sponsor a lecture series to examine "The Impact of Religious Conviction on the Politics of the 21st Century." All lectures will be held at SAISin Washington. The purpose of the series is to assess evidence of a worldwide resurgence in religious belief and to reflect on the implications of such a development at the end of the current millennium. Specifically, the project will address the following questions: What are the origins of the revival of religious fervor at the end of the 20th Century? How far and how long will this revival go? What are the chief elements of the critique of the secular order mounted by the various religions and ethical traditions enjoying a resurgence of popularity? To what degree are the religion-based critques rooted in common assumptions and compatible responses to the perceived shortcomings of secularity? What are the implications of this phenomenon particularly as they relate to international politics: prospects of war and peace, economic development, and the definition of human rights and social justice?

<TITLE>Third Wave of Think Tanks -- October 1996 Insider - Heritage</TITLE>
<center><img src="/heritage/thf_log2.gif"><br><p>
<h3>October, 1996 <i>Insider</i></h3></center> 



<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>Third Wave of Think Tanks<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER><HR>


<P>
<dd> Tip O'Neill once said &quot;All politics is local.&quot; He was
correct, but failed to mention an important corollary, that all
policy is local too. That's why we have formed the Allegheny Institute
for Public Policy -- the nation's first think tank devoted exclusively
to bringing free market solutions to local government.
<P>
<dd> Market oriented think tanks have come in three distinct waves.
In the 1970s, they began operating in Washington and laying the
intellectual groundwork for the Reagan revolution. In the 1980s,
in keeping with Reagan's revived spirit of federalism, conservative-movement
dollars and energies started working in the states as well. Intellectual
capital was &quot;block granted,&quot; as a number of entrepreneurial
policy analysts left Washington to found the second wave of policy
research groups. These state-based think tanks went on to provide
the intellectual infrastructure for the reinvention of state governments
in places like Tommy Thompson's Wisconsin, Tom Ridge's Pennsylvania,
Bill Weld's Massachusetts, and John Engler's Michigan. These groups
put welfare reform, charter schools and school choice on the public
policy map.
<P>
<dd> The time has come for a third wave -- the formation of locally-oriented
think tanks.  As dollars devolve from Washington to local governments,
taxpayer accountability should devolve as well. It would be ironic
if at the same time sound economic principles are revived in Washington,
that government programs might avoid accountability to these principles
by escaping to local bureaucracies still mired in the 1960s model
of big government.
<P>
<dd> Even before the devolution revolution, more dollars were spent
by local governments than by states or the federal government.
As devolution progresses this will become more true. Even federal
and state programs are frequently administered by local governments,
or by local subdivisions. Domestic government programs are ultimately
applied at the local level.
<P>
<dd> Although the Allegheny Institute is the first of this third wave
of local policy advocacy, it is unlikely to be the last. After
less than one year in business, we were approached by a group
from California interested in forming a similar organization modeled
after the Allegheny Institute. Due to the hard work of founder
Don Blake and others, and a little guidance from us, California
now has the benefit of the Table Mountain Institute near Sacramento.
Requests for help in starting local think tanks have come from
other places even farther away than Sacramento-Nigeria and Italy
for example. In addition we have received requests for advice
from several state think tanks that wish to start local policy
projects in their home states. Furthermore, our ideas have been
cited by all three local network television affiliates, all the
local radio news outlets and talk shows, and the local newspapers,
as well as the CBS radio network, and national newspapers such
as <I>USA Today</I> and the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>.
<P>
 <dd>Why all the attention? It has come largely because of our close
involvement in the restructuring of the government of Pittsburgh's
Allegheny County. This county, the second largest local government
between New York and Chicago, was under the rule of liberals for
over 60 years. In the last election, two conservatives won on
a privatization and deregulation platform. The crown jewel of
their platform was a 20% tax cut their first day in office.
<P>
<dd> The only way to make large tax cuts that work is to force the
bureaucracy to compete with the private sector to see who can
achieve the most efficient service delivery. This form of privatization
is sometimes called managed competition. Drawing upon research
by the Reason Foundation, we have published extensive research
on the benefits of privatization. In fact, there are over a dozen
privatization initiatives being implemented right now in Allegheny
County, including the only privatization of a property-assessments
department in the country and the first full privatization (sale)
of an airport in U.S. history.
<P>
 <dd>It's not just about privatization, but about harnessing markets
in other ways. We are engaged in the creation of a pilot program
for electricity de-regulation. We estimate that a full-scale electric
utility consumer choice program could add 5 or 6% to the regional
domestic product. In addition, we are working with the county
economic development department to quantify the amount of burden
placed on the economy by local government, with a view toward
a streamlined business-friendly permitting process.
<P>
 <dd>It's not just about markets either, it's also about culture.
Working with Robert Woodson of the National Center for Neighborhood
Enterprise we are helping to shift social service programs from
the political society to the civil society, to remove a permissive,
redistributive, liberal, social-service bureaucracy and replace
it with a flexible, results-oriented, low-cost provider network.
<P>
 <dd>Less a &quot;think tank&quot; and more a &quot;do tank,&quot;
the Allegheny Institute is taking the conservative intellectual
revolution to the laboratory of real life. Not satisfied with
having produced 30 full-length reports (and 40 editions of our
Newsfax) in our first year and a half of operations, the Allegheny
Institute has set out to prove not only that &quot;ideas have
consequences,&quot; but that <I>conservative</I> ideas actually
work at the local level.

<I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1092, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
Heritage Policy Analyst John Sweeney argues that since Mexico's
economic meltdown in 1994, both the Clinton Administration and
the 104th Congress have allowed America's once-respected leadership
role in Latin America to erode. The Administration and the Congress
have been reluctant to put expansion of NAFTA on the fast track
and instead have allowed the tremendous foreign policy successes
of the Reagan and Bush administrations to fall apart. If this
retreat is allowed to continue, writes Sweeney, U.S. economic
and security interests in the region could suffer a &quot;sustained
decline.&quot; 15 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage

by Joshua Muravchik

<I>On the Issues</I>, American Enterprise Institute<HR>

<P>
Joshua Muravchik, Resident Scholar at the American Enterprise
Institute, argues that the Clinton Administration's foreign policy
is misguided and that this has lead to the erosion of American
military supremacy. According to Muravchik, Clinton's foreign
policy has been a &quot;jumble of improvised responses to crises
and to foreign and domestic political pressures and calculations
of electoral advantage.&quot; The author writes that Clinton nearly
doubled his proposed defense cuts so he could appear to look like
he is reducing the budget deficit, while not having to reduce
domestic spending. A symbol of Clinton's low priority given to
defense is his order for sharp reductions in the development of
strategic defenses. Muravchik also argues that Clinton's policy
with China, North Korea, Serbia, and Somalia, have substantially
hurt America's credibility abroad. Overall, Muravchik concludes,
Clinton's tenure as Commander and Chief has narrowed the wide
margin of security that came about with the demise of America's
Cold War rival. 4 pp. CONTACT: American Enterprise Institute,

<B>The World Bank's Procurement Myth, <BR>
</B>by John Thibodeau
<P>
<I>Foreign Policy Briefing</I> No. 43, Cato Institute<HR>

<P>
John Thibodeau, Director of Research at Probe International, a
Canadian environmental group, reports that the World Bank's soft-loan
window, the International Development Association (IDA), is losing
many contributions due to its failed projects and the bank's increasingly
risky loan portfolio. The United States recently decided not to
contribute any new money to IDA in 1997, with any future funding
beyond that uncertain. Thibodeau argues that the World Bank has
launched a misleading public relations campaign to convince Congress
and the American public that U.S. taxpayers' contributions to
IDA are beneficial to the American economy. The World bank says
that such contributions are returned in the form of contracts
for U.S. companies. In reality, Thibodeau points out, U.S. firms
receive only about $0.23 in contracts for each $1.00 the United
States contributes to IDA. The IDA gets billions of taxpayer dollars
for bad projects and pork-barrel contracts for a few American
firms. Thibodeau concludes that Congress and lawmakers from other
donor countries should see through the World Bank's desperate
attempt to seek more funds and refuse to waste their constituent's
tax dollars on IDA in 1997 and beyond. 17 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute,

<B>The Innovation Age: A New Perspective on the Telecom Revolution,
</B><br>
by Peter Pitsch
<P>
Hudson Institute<HR>

<P>
Peter Pitsch, Adjunct Fellow at the Hudson Institute, and the
former Chief of Staff and Chief of Planning at the Federal Communications
Commission, shows why the United States cannot maintain its preeminent
position in information technology unless it reforms a number
of outdated regulatory restraints. Pitsch shows how artificial
regulations on a market, such as telecommunications, stifles the
progress and productivity that innovations were designed to stimulate.
Pitsch illustrates the superiority of a market-based approach
to regulation, and uses the theories of Austrian school economists
Hayek and Schumpeter to point out the flaws of planned economies.
Overall, Pitsch creates a positive image of what the future can
hold with an open-road policy toward the telecom industry. 120

<B>Lights Out on Federal Power: Privatization for the 21st Century,
</B><br>
by Michael Block and Rep. John Shadegg
<P>
<I>Future Insight</I>, Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation<HR>

<P>
Michael Block, Senior Fellow at the Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation,
and John Shadegg, United States Congressman from Arizona, urge
the privatization of federally owned power facilities. Power Marketing
Administrations (PMAs) were created during the New Deal to provide
a supply of inexpensive power to impoverished rural areas. Block
and Shadegg argue that demographic changes since the 1930s mean
that many of the areas deemed in need of subsidized power are
no longer rural or undeveloped. They argue that PMAs force taxpayers
to provide subsidized power to the rich, and they distort and
hinder competition and productivity in the electric energy market.
Block and Shadegg outline how the federal government should sell
three PMAs. Selling off this large source of frozen assets would
generate nearly $4.5 billion, and help reduce the budget deficit.
Finally, to overcome interest-group oppostion to PMA privatization,
they propose that the current consumers of PMA power be given

<I>Regulatory Reform Project</I>, <BR>
Competitive Enterprise Institute<HR>

<P>
Clyde Wayne Crews, CEI Fellow in Regulatory Studies, illustrates
that compliance with federal regulations, which are officially
off-budget, have quietly expanded into costs greater than the
entire GNP of Canada. According to Crews, regulatory costs absorb
almost 20% of the average family's after-tax budget. Politicians
can avoid accountability for more expenses to taxpayers by passing
mandates and regulations that transfer costs to business and consumers
and are not reflected in the budget. Crews warns that a Balance
Budget Amendment may pressure Congress to push even further regulations
that put costs off-budget. He calls for Congress to establish
rules that new agency regulations require Congressional approval,
and to establish a limited regulatory budget. Overall, Crews calls
for making regulatory costs as transparent as direct taxes, and
ensuring that Congress bears direct accountability for every dollar
that agency regulations cost voters. 23 pp. CONTACT: Competitive

<B>A Revolution in Regulation: New York Must Treat Employers as
Customers to Compete for the Growth and Jobs We Need</B>
<P>
Public Policy Institute of New York State<HR>

<P>
New York's regulatory bureaucracy is a primary reason that the
state has an image of being hostile to business-and a record of
losing jobs to other locations. In addition to the hassle of overwhelming
amounts of red tape, these regulations can hurt or even shut down
businesses by imposing prohibitive fees, fines and taxes. Employers
must be treated as customers if New York is to compete for the
jobs and growth it needs, according to the Public Policy Institute.
The Institute recommends several steps to achieve regulatory reform,
arguing that key draft regulations should be rewritten before
they become additional burdens to companies. Also, needless regulatory
costs imposed by the Labor Department and the workers' compensation
system should be eliminated. Overall, the report recommends the
laws that limit the powers and responsibilities of regulators
should be enforced, and innovative use of new technologies to
achieve regulatory goals should be allowed to happen. 67 pp. CONTACT:

<B>Regulatory Costs in Profile, </B><br>

<P>
<I>Policy Study</I> No. 132, Center for the Study of <BR>
American Business<HR>

<P>
Thomas Hopkins, Adjunct Fellow at the Center for the Study of
American Business, illustrates the vast extent of regulatory costs
in virtually every segment of the U.S. economy. 60 different federal
agencies enact and enforce countless regulations that result in
hidden compliance costs of $668 billion annually. In this book,
Hopkins presents estimates of annual private-sector compliance
costs with federal regulation for 1977 through 2000, and focuses
on the differences in compliance costs among firms. The figures
show that regulatory compliance costs facing all U.S. businesses
rose by $10 billion or more annually in the four years ending
in 1992 after a decade in which such costs generally moved downward.
With the figures presented in this book, Hopkins hopes to bring
a better understanding of the scope and incidence of compliance
costs to help facilitate a more rational debate about the role
and effects of government agency regulations. 25 pp. CONTACT:

<B>Capital Versus Labor? The Dubious Economics of Class Conflict,

<P>
<I>Hudson Briefing Paper</I>, No. 195, Hudson Institute<HR>

<P>
Alan Reynolds, Director of Economic Research at Hudson Institute,
responds to the recent mood of hostility toward investors, property
owners, and corporate managers in recent press commentary on the
U.S. economy. Such hostility, according to Reynolds, seems to
be an encouragement toward class warfare between &quot;workers&quot;
and &quot;shareholders.&quot; He argues that the data contradicts
the assertions that workers and shareholders are  natural adversaries.
He points out that workers benefit only when productivity increases,
and that productivity depends on capital investment, which depends
on saving. It is punitive tax policies that explain the recent
sluggish productivity growth that has brought stagnation in employee
wages and compensation. Overall, Reynolds argues, the economy
needs more, not less capital, and the only way to end the stagnation
of employee wages is to decrease punitive tax rates against saving
and investing. 9 pp.  CONTACT: Hudson Institute, Herman Kahn Center,

<B>An Analysis of the Dole-Kemp Tax Cuts, <BR>
</B>by Gary Robbins and Aldona Robbins
<P>
<I>Issue Brief</I>, Institute for Policy Innovation<HR>

<P>
Gary Robbins and Aldona Robbins, Senior Research Fellows at the
Institute for Policy Innovation, examine the proposed Dole-Kemp
tax cuts. Their analysis finds that the Dole-Kemp plan would boost
the U.S. real growth rate by roughly one-half a percentage point
over the next six years. They scored the proposed tax plan using
both static and dynamic methods. After adjusting for greater incentives
to work, save and invest, the economy, according to Robbins and
Robbins, would be 4.5 percent larger than it would have been without
the tax cuts, and would produce about 2.8 million new jobs. The
growth would offset 35 percent of the $551.3 billion static revenue
loss between 1997 and 2002. A standard distributional analysis
shows that 60 percent of the Dole-Kemp tax cuts would go to taxpayers
earning under $100,000. They also found that although the people
with the lowest 20 percent of incomes pay less than one percent
of federal income taxes, they would receive the greatest percentage
boost of after tax income in higher wages. 16 pp.  CONTACT: The

In 1988, the Washington Research Council made a systematic review
of Washington's state taxes, and found the tax system to be fundamentally
sound. Since then, however, there have been a number of changes
in tax rates and bases. This paper, updates WRC's review of the
state tax system using five criteria: economic neutrality, fairness,
administrative simplicity, transparency, and stability. The report
 also provides a history of Washington's state taxes, including
a list of major tax events from 1889 to the present to show how
the state's tax structure has changed over the years. 20 pp. CONTACT:

<B>Public Subsidies, Private Gain: Stop Violating the Oregon Constitution,
</B><br>
by Professor Dale Rubin
<P>
<I>Fiscal Insight</I>, No. 13, Cascade Policy Institute<HR>

<P>
Dale Rubin, Professor of Law at Willamette University, examines
how public subsidies lead to private gain, and how this procedure
violates the Oregon Constitution. He points out that legislators
explain that public expenditures that directly benefit private
individuals, such as professional sports teams, are legal because
they are extended for a &quot;public purpose.&quot; Rubin argues
that this response is simply wrong. He explains that the Public
Purpose Doctrine was not made in order to provide legislators
an excuse to spend taxpayer dollars on whatever project they choose.
In fact, the Oregon Constitution contains clear and unambiguous
clauses that explicitly prohibit the legislature and political
subdivisions from giving any aid to private individuals or corporations.
Rubin argues that the courts' misuse of the Public Purpose Doctrine
has made it possible for public entities to spend public dollars
on almost any private project despite a specific constitutional
prohibition. Rubin argues that the constitutional provisions prohibiting
the commingling of public and private funds have been rendered
meaningless by modern court decisions. 11 pp.  CONTACT: Cascade

<B>The Prisoners of Charity: Welfare 'Reforms' in New York Have Done Little to Break the Cycle of Dependency</B>
<P>
Public Policy Institute of New York State<HR>

<P>
The Public Policy Institute finds that welfare reforms in New
York have done too little to break the cycle of dependency of
its recipients. After Congress enacted legislation in 1988 intended
to move welfare recipients into the workforce, New York took an
expensive detour to implement legislation that emphasized &quot;back-to-school&quot;
rather than &quot;back-to-work.&quot; These programs were a failure
and caused the percentage of welfare recipients in the job market
to actually drop. The Public Policy Institute argues that in order
for any welfare-to-work strategy to be successful it, must incorporate
programs that make work pay. They also argue that private sector
jobs need to be made to look more attractive compared to welfare
benefits. While raising the minimum wage reduces the number of
entry level jobs, lowering welfare benefits could send more people
into the shelter system-at a greater cost financially and personally.
Instead, the Institute suggests a &quot;fill-in-the-gap&quot;
approach that allows more wages to be kept before welfare benefits
are reduced. They conclude that overall successful reforms will
begin when it is acknowledged that the poor want to, and can,
take responsibility for their future. The report includes a foreword
by United States Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 47 pp. CONTACT:

During the Spring of 1996, the Goldwater Institute conducted its
second annual Charter School Survey. The first survey was directed
at parents. The latest survey was aimed at charter school teachers.
Arizona is home to approximately 30 percent of the nation's 350
charter schools. Approximately 16,000 students will attend such
a school during the 1996-97 school year. The results of this survey
tell a great deal about these charter schools, including teachers,
school and classroom configurations, teaching methods, parental
involvement, and students receiving instruction. Additionally,
the survey describes why educators are choosing to teach in charter
schools and offers a glimpse of charter school organization and
school development. 40 pp. CONTACT: Goldwater Institute, Bank

<B>Competition, Choice, and the Structure of Public Education</B>
<P>
<I>Dialogue</I> No. 16, Pioneer Institute<HR>

<P>
This paper is the transcript of a forum sponsored by the Pioneer
Institute on the state and direction of the Boston Public School
System. The forum included these four panelists: James Peyser,
Executive Director of the Pioneer Institute, and member of the
State Board of Education; Neil Sullivan, Executive Director of
the Boston Private Industry Council; Kristen McCormack, charter
school founder and former head of Federated Dorchester Neighborhood
Houses; and Edwin Melendez, Member of the Boston School Committee,
and Director of the Mauricio Gaston Institute at the University
of Massachusetts/Boston. In the opening remarks given by James
Peyser, the failure of school reform is blamed on the underlying
structural defect of public schools-the monopoly power of school
districts. He also argues that spending priorities have been out
of line. While real per-pupil spending has rise by 53 percent
from 1967 to 1991, only 4 percent of it went to regular education-the
core of schools. He argues that public school education priorities
have been driven by politics rather than the needs of the students,
the desires of parents, or the strategies of educators. Peyser
lays out a plan for structural reform of the Boston Public School
System in which there will be a system of schools, rather than
a unitary school system, that will place parents, students and
educators at the center, and will end the political and bureaucratic
constraints that have made past reform efforts fail. 11 pp. CONTACT:

in School,</a> </B><br>
by Dorothy Hanks
<P>
<I>F.Y.I.</I> No. 120, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
Dorothy Hanks, Research Assistant at The Heritage Foundation,
examines how the Milwaukee School Choice Program, enacted in 1990,
has helped poor children succeed in school. Milwaukee's program
was the nation's first publicly funded school choice program,
and gave low-income parents vouchers to send their children to
private schools. Hanks relays the findings of a recent assessment
of the program by Professors Jay P. Greene of the University of
Houston Center for Public Policy, and Paul E. Petersen of Harvard
University's Program in Education Policy and Governance. Their
study reveals that the reading scores of choice students were
3 to 5 percentile points higher in their third and fourth years,
respectively, than those of comparable low-income public school
students. On math scores, Greene and Petersen found that choice
students were 5 and 12 percentile point higher for the third and
fourth years respectively. Hanks explains, in detail, how the
study was performed, and how it corrected the methodological errors
of previous studies on the subject of school choice. She also
lists a number of other bodies of research that back up the Houston-Harvard
analysis on the value of private schools among urban poor and
minority students. In the conclusion, Hanks emphasizes that the
success of Milwaukee school choice is now a matter of record,
and that it is time for state legislators and members of Congress
to allow low-income children to escape the failing urban public
schools. 5 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation,

Despite the presence of serious flaws in current environmental
laws, conservatives have failed to develop a coherent vision of
how these laws ought to be reformed, writes John Shanahan, Environmental
Policy Analyst at the Heritage Foundation. Instead, the debate
about reform usually results in conservatives being falsely characterized
as &quot;anti-environmental.&quot; Shanahan offers an examination
of how conservative critics of our existing environmental policy
can better emphasize the good intentions of present law, and at
the same time, argue for elimination of the sometimes senseless
and oppressive regulations that burden the economy. He shows how
liberal policies have brought little in return for exorbinant
costs, and calls for tapping into the powerful forces and positive
incentives of the market and property ownership-incentives that
reward responsible behavior. Shanahan concludes that Americans
can protect the environment more effectively while simultaneously
increasing economic freedom and growth. 11 pp.  CONTACT: Chris

The issue of term limits will be on fifteen different state ballots

Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute, argues that term limits are
needed, but, that the only way to achieve them is by a constitutional
amendment. Since Congres is unlikely to voluntarily approve one,
Term-limits supporters need to convince 34 states to call for
a convention to draft an appropriate amendment. Bandow believes
that if the states call for a convention that it would encourage
Congress to propose an amendment, in the same way that the Seventeenth
amendment came about.  16 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts

change makes marriage less necessary and easier to end. In this
paper, Maley looks at ways to give marriage greater legal support
without creating undue obstacles to divorce. He advocates introducing
fault into divorce settlements as a way to indirectly re-enforce
the institution. &quot;Fault&quot; in divorce proceedings is where
one party-for reasons such as violence, substance abuse or child
neglect-is at fault in the marriage and that this should therefore
be taken into account in a divorce settlement. Maley concludes
that this reform would create clear standards of marital conduct
and give incentives for standards to be observed. 32 pp. CONTACT:

Cindy Silver, a lawyer in Vancouver, British Columbia, examines
family autonomy and the Canadian Charter of Rights. She observes
that a radical restructuring of the roles and relationships of
the family and state has developed. The state is taking an evermore
active role in protecting child rights as defined under the United
Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Silver discusses
the impact on the family of state attempts to both define and
protect &quot;the best interests of the child.&quot; She reviews
certain recent cases that deal with the state superseding parental
rights over a child, and calls for affirming the importance of
the family by, once again, giving explicit recognition within
the Canadian constitution. Finally, she lauds a recent Canadian
Supreme Court decision that renewed recognition of the family
and provided a much-needed balance to the administrative and judicial
polices of the state in cases involving the parent-child relationship.

<B>Settlement Reached on <BR>
Behalf of VCU Professors</B>
<P>
CIR represented six male professors who sued Virginia Commonwealth
University for sex discrimination arising from a 1992 &quot;women-only&quot;
pay raise. After the trial judge granted VCU summary judgment
on the basis of a regression analysis that purported to show a
pay imbalance between the sexes, the full Fourth Circuit Court
of Appeals reversed. The <I>en banc</I> court said that a question
existed as to whether the regression analysis actually established
a pay imbalance and remanded the case for trial.
<P>
The day before the September 23 trial date, the parties negotiated
a settlement. VCU promised not to adjust pay in the future without
considering merit, but demanded that the financial details of
the settlement remain confidential. The professors stated that
they were very satisfied with the terms of the settlement.
<P>
<B>CIR Represents Class Objecting <BR>
to Proposed Settlement</B>
<P>
In September, a class of non-black Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms (BATF) agents moved to intervene in <I>Stewart v.
Rubin</I>. The initial case was filed as a class action lawsuit
in 1990 on behalf of all African-American Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms agents. The plaintiffs charged the BATF's Office
of Criminal Enforcement with discrimination against African-American
agents in its hiring and promotion practices. The parties reached
a proposed settlement that received the preliminary approval of
District Court Judge Royce Lamberth on July 9, 1996.
<P>
Under the proposed settlement, the class of African-American agents
will receive a multi-million dollar cash settlement. Further,
African-American agents will be eligible for promotion pursuant
to an informal procedure that will be distinctly different from,
and far less rigorous, than that applicable to all other agents.
<P>
CIR, on behalf of non-black BATF agents, is challenging the race-conscience
relief provided for in the proposed settlement on the ground that
it is unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment. Specifically,
there is  no evidence of present effects of past discrimination
and the remedy is not narrowly tailored to meet a compelling government
interest.

<B>Due Process Due Private Contractors</B>
<P>
The United States Supreme Court has been asked to hear a due process
case, in which the Department of Defense (DOD) arbitrarily canceled
a lucrative contract for default, without holding a hearing mandated
by federal law.
<P>
In <I>DCX v. William J. Perry, Secretary of Defense</I>, a defense
contractor was hired to manufacture lighting equipment for the
government, and had hired a subcontractor (the only subcontractor
with the necessary technology) to test the equipment. However,
the government intervened in the testing schedule and forced the
subcontractor to test other systems with a higher priority. The
delay resulted in DCX being in default on contract. DOD then abruptly
canceled the contract.
<P>
In taking that action, DOD did not follow its own regulations
requiring it to assess the circumstances and determine whether
the default was excusable. Under the government's own regulations,
the assessment must be made prior to terminating a contract. DCX
sued, alleging that by not applying the regulations, DOD violated
DCX's due process rights. Had a hearing been held, DCX would have
shown: 1) the government was responsible for the delay; 2) DCX
would still be able to meet the contract delivery date; and 3)
termination of the contract would bankrupt several small businesses
that subcontracted with DCX. The federal trial and appellate courts
held for the government, and DCX has now petitioned the Supreme
Court to review the case.
<P>
In its <I>amicus curiae</I>, Defenders urged the Court to review
the case on the ground that under the Due Process Clause of the
Fifth Amendment, government must act fairly when it deprives a
person of property, which in this case consists of contract rights.
<P>
<B>State Corners Market By Infringing Private Property Rights</B>
<P>
Defenders is co-counsel to Mr. Taylor who owns property surrounded
by the Cass Scenic Railroad in Pocahontas County, West Virginia.
Mr. Taylor decided to build a restaurant and souvenir shop to
service the hundreds of tourists to the Railroad. At present,
the only concession stand in the park is operated by the state.
Fearful of the competition from Mr. Taylor's proposed shop, the
state decided to simply block the only access to the property
across the state land. On the day construction was to begin, the
state locked the gate to the public access road, and has refused
to allow Mr. Taylor entry onto <I>his own property</I>. Since
then, the state has proceeded to take any action it desires on
the property without the consent of the owner, including removing
trees and altering its elevation.
<P>
Defenders plans to file a lawsuit in federal district court in
West Virginia, alleging the state: 1) unconstitutionally deprived
Mr. Taylor of his right to use and enjoy his private property
in violation of the United States and West Virginia constitutions;
2) tortuously interfered with Mr. Taylor's economic advantage
by preventing him from establishing his business; and 3) unlawfully
trespassed on private property.

<B>Report on School Choice Cases</B>
<P>
Ohio - The parties are briefing the case in the Court of Appeals.
The IJ brief is due on October 29th. Jeanne Allen of the Center
for Education Reform has agreed to coordinate an <I>amicus</I>
brief on behalf of pro-school choice groups. IJ expects oral argument
later this fall, and a decision most likely in the spring.
<P>
Milwaukee - IJ is briefing the non-religion state constitutional
issues in trial court, with a resolution expected later this fall.
 The court granted the NAACP's motion to consolidate its lawsuit,
which it filed in August, with the ongoing cases. The NAACP repeats
the same allegations, but adds a racial segregation claim. The
court will hold that issue until resolution of the current issues,
and we expect appeals to follow the next ruling rather than awaiting
resolution of the segregation claims.  The IJ's goal is to move
the litigation along swiftly, winning on as many issues as possible
at this level.  So far, the NAACP's efforts to derail the case
have not succeeded.
<P>
Vermont - As expected, the ACLU joined the lawsuit challenging
Chittenden's decision to pay tuition at religious schools. At
a status conference on October 1, the trial judge ordered the
state not to withhold education aid from Chittenden, and directed
Chittenden not to pay religious school tuition pending a ruling
on its merits. The court directed the parties to stipulate the
facts, and indicated it would expedite the case and render a decision
later this fall. That means the case should be in the Vermont
Supreme Court this winter, and possibly in the U.S. Supreme Court
as early as next year.

<P>
<B>NELF Enters Declaratory Jurisdiction Dispute</B>
<P>
NELF has entered a case which threatens to undercut the usefulness
of the federal declaratory judgment law. A declaratory judgment
is a method of obtaining judicial determination of rights and
wrongs before a matter has reached the stage of ordinary litigation.
Businesses often use this procedure to eliminate uncertainty.
<P>
The case involves a looming patent dispute between EMC Corporation
and Norand Company. Norand sent EMC a letter claiming EMC was
infringing its patents and suggesting EMC pay it millions in licensing
fees. Negotiations broke down and EMC filed suit in Boston seeking
a declaratory judgment that there was no infringement. A district
court judge found that the dispute was not sufficiently ripe to
confer jurisdiction. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit, which hears patent-related appeals, affirmed, but on
different grounds. It found jurisdiction but held that trial judges
have almost total discretion to decide whether to hear declaratory
actions, even when statutory jurisdiction is conceded.
<P>
NELF filed an <I>amicus</I> brief in its own name supporting rehearing
which argued that declaratory actions are a valuable way to remove
uncertainty. By giving judges broad discretion not to hear such
cases, the court undercut that process and may have introduced
subjectivity into the judicial process. Judges can now avoid types
of cases they do not want to hear and, may choose to hear cases
which interest them and for which they may have preconceived views.
This conflicts with the ideal of a neutral, objective judiciary.
While rehearing has been denied, NELF is supporting EMC in seeking
review by the U.S. Supreme Court.
<P>
<B>NELF Files Brief in Connecticut <BR>
Property Tax Case</B>
<P>
On behalf of the Connecticut Business and Industry Association,
NELF has filed a brief in a test of whether that state's courts
will continue independent reviews of appeals from local tax authorities.
The case involves Hartford's taxation of copiers owned by Xerox
Company. The assessor used &quot;book&quot; value as the basis
for taxing the copiers, rejecting Xerox's evidence as to their
true market value, the statutory basis for local taxation. A Superior
Court judge affirmed the city's decision.
<P>
NELF's <I>amicus</I> brief to the Connecticut Supreme Court argued
that the judge erred by looking only to whether the assessor's
decision was &quot;reasonable.&quot; NELF argued that, because
of the inherent conflict between assessors' duties to apply the
law and to maximize tax revenues, courts can and must independently
determine all necessary issues including determinations of value.
Ceding that power to assessors could leave taxpayers vulnerable
to arbitrary and even malicious misassessments.
<P>
<B>NELF Defeats Effort to Tax Non-Profit <BR>
Legal Groups</B>
<P>
In a case with ramifications for all non-profit firms, NELF has
defeated the City of Boston's effort to levy taxes upon NELF's
Boston office. The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled
that Boston violated state law when it denied NELF the tax exemption
statutorily allowed to all non-profit organizations.
<P>
The case began in 1991 when Boston reject NELF's first application
for exemption for its Boston office. Possibly referring to NELF's
successful challenge to a Boston ordinance, a city bureaucrat
sneered that the city would not &quot;feed the hand that bites
it.&quot; NELF appealed to the Appellate Tax Board and eventually
went to Superior Court. The city's position throughout was that
NELF was &quot;too political.&quot; While conceding that NELF
is non-partisan and completely avoids electoral politics and lobbying,
the city claimed NELF's work in the courts was an impermissible
effort to &quot;change the law.&quot; Eventually other property-owning
legal foundations headquartered in Boston were caught up in the
dispute when NELF's attorneys pointed out the hypocrisy of taxing
NELF while exempting groups with different missions.
<P>
The Court's decision resolves this matter. It stresses NELF's
essentially conservative role. Courts apply law, they do not make
it. By pursuing cases, NELF is not seeking to make new law; it
is trying to uphold the law as it already stands. The Court also
rejected Boston's claim that NELF serves too small a fraction
of the community to be entitled to exemption. It held that NELF's
legal work benefits the public as a whole and so NELF meets the
statutory test for a charitable organization.
<P>
By rebuffing Boston here, NELF not only protected its own interest
but also set a precedent that will limit future government attempts
to extract revenue from non-profits or to coerce them into tailoring
their missions to fit government's wishes.
<P>
<B>NELF Files Brief for Realtors in <BR>
Large Lot Zoning Case</B>
<P>
On behalf of the Greater Boston Real Estate Board, NELF filed
an <I>amicus</I> brief with Massachusetts' highest court, urging
adoption of guidelines on how to review local zoning rules which
impose large minimum lot sizes. The case comes from Martha's Vineyard
where the town of Edgartown bars new housing on lots smaller than
three acres, substantially reducing the supply of affordable new
housing and imposing significant limitations on landowners' rights
to use their property. NELF's brief argued that the court should
require lower courts to give special scrutiny to large lot zoning
because of its negative impact on migration into the town and
because of its devastating effect on owners of lots under minimum
size.

<B>WASHINGTON LEGAL FOUNDATION</B><HR>

<P>
<B>Texas IOLTA Program Derailed</B>
<P>
The Washington Legal Foundation scored a major victory when the
U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit unanimously ruled
on September 12, 1996 that Texas' Interest On Lawyer's Trust Accounts
(IOLTA) program is subject to First Amendment and Fifth Amendment
takings challenges. In <I>Washington Legal Foundation v. Texas
Equal Access to Justice Foundation</I>, the court of appeals took
bar authorities to task for arguing that the interest generated
on clients' funds that are pooled before the funds are disbursed
to them is not the property of the clients. Comparing this fund
raising scheme to alchemy, the court ruled that interest always
follow the principal regardless of the amount generated. IOLTA
programs generate approximately $150 million<B> </B>annually nationwide,
which is used to supplement Legal Services Corporation funding
for activist groups. Texas bar authorities, along the American
Bar Association and other groups, are expected to seek Supreme
Court review of this precedent-setting decision, which conflicts
with a First Circuit decision also litigated by WLF.
<P>
<B>Superfund Law Challenged</B>
<P>
WLF filed a brief with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh
Circuit in <I>U.S. v. Olin Corporation</I> seeking to uphold a
lower court decision that ruled that the 1980 Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), or Superfund
law, does not apply to discharges of hazardous wastes that occurred
before the law went into effect, and that if it did, the law as
applied would violate the Commerce Clause because there was no
showing how the inactive site affects interstate commerce. WLF's
clients in the case include U.S. Senators Bob Smith, Lauch Faircloth,
Larry Pressler, Alan Simpson and Representatives Michael Oxley,
Bob Livingston, Joe Barton, Sonny Callahan, Jack Fields, Jimmy
Hayes, John Hostettler, Enid Greene, and Bill Goodling.
<P>
<B>Junk Science Challenged in the Courtroom</B>
<P>
WLF filed a brief in the Supreme Court of Nevada in <I>Mahlum
v. Dow Chemical Co.</I>, arguing that Dow Chemical should not
be held liable for alleged injuries caused by silicone breast
implants made by Dow-Corning, a separate legal entity. WLF argues
that not only is there no credible evidence showing that the silicone
implants caused any harm, but that in any event, Dow Chemical,
which had nothing to do with the manufacturing or testing of the
silicone, should not be held liable because of a lack of legal
causation between the injuries and Dow Chemical. Rather, the plaintiff's
attorneys were simply trying to obtain money from Dow Chemical
because Dow Corning had filed for bankruptcy under the crush of
implant lawsuits.
<P>
<B>Sex Offender Law Defended</B>
<P>
WLF filed a brief in the U.S. Supreme Court in <I>Kansas v. Hendrick</I>
seeking to uphold state laws that impose preventive detention
on dangerous sex offenders after they complete their original
sentences. WLF filed its brief on behalf of Kansas state legislators,
asz well as Kansas's entire House of Representatives delegation
-U.S. Representatives Sam Brownback, Jan Meyers, Pat Roberts,
and Todd Tiahrt, as well as .

<B>Young America's Publishes Briefs on Social Security and Financial
Aid, and 3rd Edition of <I>The Myth of the Robber Barons</I></B>
<P>
The latest two issue briefs from the Young America's Foundation
provide information on the issues of social security privatization
and reform of the student financial aid system, two issues important
to college-aged students. These two briefs will provide information
that will allow conservative students to challenge liberal professors,
fellow classmates, and slanted editorials on the two subjects.
 
<P>
YAF has also published the 3rd Edition of <I>The Myth of the Robber
Barons,</I> by Burt Folsom, Visiting Fellow at the Mackinac Center.
First published in 1987, the book was widely praised and is now
assigned in scores of colleges and universities throughout the
United States. The book challenges the liberal interpretation
of the rise of big business that is found in many textbooks on
American history.

<B>Grove City College Rejects Department of Education Demands</B>
<P>
Grove City College in western Pennsylvania has announced that
it will end its participation in the Federal Stafford and Federal
PLUS loan programs at the end of the current academic year. The
college will replace the Stafford/PLUS loans for its students
with a privately financed loan program. Current regulations require
that Grove City sign a complex participation agreement that subjects
it to federal government oversight, and also to furnish audited
financial statements to the federal government. According to the
school this move reflects its long-standing principles of remaining
independent and free from government intrusion in the operation
of the College.

<B>Free Congress Foundation Video Tape: &quot;America the Bankrupt.&quot;</B>
<P>
The Free Congress Foundation has released a new video tape hosted
by the former Governor of Delaware, Pete DuPont, entitled &quot;American
the Bankrupt.&quot; The tape examines the &quot;true&quot; national
debt. The problems highlighted in the tape include: a national
debt that is spiraling out of control, a Medicare program that
will go bankrupt in 2001,  Social Security fraud, massive growth
in entitlement spending, a welfare system that doesn not work,
and soaring tax rates. The tape also features commentary by Senator
Larry Craig, Senator Don Nickles, Rep. Mark Neuman, OMB Director
Alice Rivlin, and several other economic experts. CONTACT: Free

<B>National Tax Limitation Foundation's State/Local Government
Fiscal <BR>
Restraint Project</B>
<P>
The National Tax Limitation Foundation (NTLF) has initaited a
project to review and analyze state and local government fiscal
restraint mechanisms. The maturation of the tax limitation movement
at state and local levels, and the devolution/block granting of
functions from Washington to the states convinced NTLF to undertake
this project. NTLF is seeking to create a systematic body of knowledge
that can illustrate what types and combinations of fiscal restraint
devices work best to control state/local government taxes and
spending. This will provide a unique, permanent body of data and
analysis that NTLF hopes will enable policy makers to shape state/local
government institutions in a more fiscally responsible fashion.
NTLF plans to work with key players in each state: state policy
councils, ALEC legislative leaders, tax research groups, fiscaly
conservative academics and taxpayer advocacy organizations and
activists.  CONTACT: National Tax Limitation Foundation, State/Local

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=4>Reviewing the Revolution: Conservative
Successes in the 104th Congress<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER><HR>
<P>
Buoyed by the dramatic outcome of the 1994 elections,
conservatives had high expectations for the incoming Congress.
For the first time in 40 years, conservatives assumed key leadership
roles in both chambers. Particularly encouraging were the members
of the incoming House freshman class, many of whom had based their
successful campaigns on the Contract With America and its bold
commitment to reforming Congress and reducing the size and scope
of government.
<P>
Considering President Clinton's many vetoes of major
legislation, conservatives have achieved amazing success in transforming
government and the way Congress does business. Despite setbacks
and retreats, the 104th Congress has fulfilled conservative's
hopes in several key areas by beginning a revolutionary reversal
of failed liberal policies in such areas as welfare, agriculture,
and regulation.
<P>
The successes of the 104th Congress are particularly
significant when measured against the records of previous Congresses.
While this Congress adopted significant government reforms with
only narrow majorities, the New Deal and Great Society Congresses
had large liberal majorities. Moreover, the legislation passed
by those lawmakers was championed and signed by liberal Presidents.
Although the revolution remains to be completed, conservatives
should appreciate the progress that has been made.
<P>
No assessment of the 104th Congress would be complete
without a recognition of what could have been accomplished if
the President had not vetoed critical legislation. The most important
accomplishment of this Congress was a balanced budget bill which
would have eliminated the deficit by the year 2002 while mandating
$245 billion in critical tax reductions. American families would
have benefited from a $500 per child tax credit.
<P>
This legislation not only represented the first balanced
budget in 26 years, but also contained significant reforms in
government programs which would have returned power to states
and communities. In spite of the President's opposition, Congress
succeeded in reducing discretionary spending for the first time
since 1969. As submitted, the President's FY 1996 budget would
have raised the deficit to $211 billion; Congress deserves the
taxpayers' appreciation for cutting the Administration's projected
deficit nearly in half.
<P>
Perhaps the most notable achievement of the 104th
Congress was its overhaul of the nation's welfare system. While
the President twice vetoed welfare reform bills, he indicated
that he would sign a third which differed from the first two bills
only in minor respects. This historic legislation ends the federal
entitlement to welfare, contains real work requirements and time
limits, and fights illegitimacy. President Clinton promised to
&quot;end welfare as we know it.&quot; But it was conservatives
in Congress who made this promise a reality.
<P>
In many other areas, Congress succeeded in adopting
conservative, commonsense alternatives to liberal approaches advanced
by the Clinton Administration and its allies on Capitol Hill.
Congress restored funding for important national security programs
that were slashed by the Administration and its allies in Congress.
Lawmakers deregulated telecommunications, stemmed the tide of
costly federal mandates, and gave the President the line-item
veto.
<P>
Conservatives in the last Congress stopped the Clinton
health care bill that would have led to socialized medicine; this
Congress passed a scaled-down version of health care reform that
had as its primary goal enhancing portability of health insurance.
However, Congress did not address the flawed tax treatment of
employment-based health insurance that produces costly distortions
in the health care market, undermines consumer choice, and restricts
access to health insurance.
<P>
Congress has more work to do to complete work on
other conservative objectives. Lawmakers failed to pass legislation
to end racial preferences. They were unable to end government
funding for left-wing political activities. They failed to close
down the Energy, Education, Commerce, or Housing Departments.
The National Endowment for the Arts and the Legal Services Corporation
live on. But Congress did achieve cuts in all of these programs
that were unthinkable before 1994.
<P>
It took 60 years to build the modern welfare state,
and it will take more than just two years to do what is needed
to reform it. The 104th Congress, has taken significant steps
to reduce the size of the federal government and to empower states,
local communities, and individuals. President Clinton has stated
that &quot;the era of big government is over.&quot; The 104th
Congress has actually done something to turn this rhetoric <BR>
into reality.<BR>

A Challenge to the U.S., <BR></a></B>by Richard Fisher
<P>
<I>Asian Studies Center Backgrounder</I>, No. 142, The Heritage
Foundation<HR>
<P>
China's moves to expand and modernize its air force poses the
first major challenge to the U.S. post-Cold War strategy in Asia.
With China's commitment to build a world class air force, Richard
Fisher, Senior Policy Analyst at the Heritage Foundation, argues
that the United States must proceed with programs to guarantee
American air superiority in Asia. According to Fisher, the U.S.
should: sustain funding for the F-22A jet fighter; maintain 12
Navy aircraft battle groups; develop an air-superiority fighter
for the Navy; accelerate development of a helmet-sighted missile
and make advance U.S. air-to-air missiles available to U.S. allies;
develop advanced versions of the F-16 and F-18 for allied and
friendly Asian air forces; and ask Russia and Israel to curtail
sales of advanced combat aircraft and related technology to China.

<P>
Ariel Cohen, Salvatori Fellow in Russian and Eurasian Studies
at the Heritage Foundation, scrutinizes the fall of the Soviet
Union on the grounds that it was an empire. Prior to the downfall
of the Eastern Block, Sovietologists held no consensus that the
USSR was an empire to begin with. This is one reason why the fall
was so surprising. In theory and writings on empires, however,
there was abundant evidence that the USSR was soon going to collapse.

Bruce Bueno de Mesquita, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution,
and Jongryn Mo, Hoover National Fellow, predict that the North
Korean military and the leaders of heavy industry, will be the
powers who will control North Korea's destiny for the next few
years. The authors expect that North Korea will enter a period
of political instability and Kim Jong-Il will become little more
than a figurehead. The authors conclude that North Korea will
not likely improve its economy or stabilize its government in
the next few years. 19 pp. CONTACT: Hoover Institution Press,

<B>Antiproliferation of the 21st Century, <BR>
</B>by Kerry Herron
<P>
<I>Strategic Review</I>, Vol. XXIV, No. 3, United States Strategic
Institute<HR>

<P>
Kerry Herron, retired U.S. Air Force Colonel, and Associate Director
for Security Studies at the University of New Mexico Institute
for Public Policy, examines the issue of &quot;full spectrum antiproliferation&quot;
as a nuclear deterrent in the post-Cold War world. Full-spectrum
antiproliferation presents an alternative to nonproliferation
and systematic deterrence. Herron explains that full spectrum
antiproliferation integrates: 1) polices that are designed to
slow and limit the number of states with nuclear weapons; 2) procedures
intended to reduce the nuclear dangers among proliferates by promoting
nuclear deterrence, nuclear surety (safety, security, and use
control), and responsible management of nuclear materials while
reducing the risks of nuclear terrorism; and 3) reactive capabilities
and policies for reducing risks associated with nuclear crises
that are not deterred or otherwise prevented. Herron believes
that full-spectrum antiproliferation is the best way to deal with
the world's current situation with nuclear missiles. According
to Herron, this policy &quot;recognizes the value of both prevention
and deterrence in coping with the challenges of nuclear proliferation,
and provides for their integration into policy options consistent
with a comprehensive proliferation strategy.&quot; He concludes
that twentieth century prescriptions are inadequate for twenty-first
century problems.  10 pp. CONTACT: United States Strategic Institute,

<B>The Nuclear Black Market</B><BR>
<P>
<I>CSIS Task Force Report</I>, Center for Strategic and International
Studies<HR>

<P>
CSIS's <I>Global Organized Crime Project</I> (GOC) was established
to develop short- and long-term strategies to deal with the threats
to U.S. national security in the post-Cold War era posed by global
organized crime. This report, produced by the Nuclear Black Market
Task Force, one of seven groups that make up GOC, focuses on the
supply, illicit trafficking, and demand for nuclear weapons and
weapons usable uranium and plutonium, from the Former Soviet Union
(FSU). The task force presents a bleak picture of poorly protected
storage sites for Russia's more than 1,500 tons of weapons-grade
fissile material guarded by demoralized and underpaid guards.
This creates a situation where terrorist groups or corrupt security
personnel, and even rogue states could obtain the components needed
to build a nuclear device. The current situation is ripe for struggling
nuclear workers to be tempted to steal or sell materials. Partly
as a result of dismantlement, the current trafficking trends have
upward trends. The potential for an accident or use of smuggled
nuclear materials is likely to increase. On a brighter note the
Task Force reports that certain trends are favorable. For example,
improvements in the material protection, control, and accountability
programs in the FSU is progressing, albeit slowly. Also the number
of deployed warheads has been reduced, transit states are starting
to use technical detectors, and the international community beginning
to respond to the problem. The Task Force has developed policy
recommendations in policy, organization, technology, legislation,
and international instruments. They recommend that U.S. policy
makers do the following: apply performance measures' aim for sustainability;
implement cooperative programs for material destruction and removal
of weapons from the FSU; develop bilateral safeguards with Russia;
consider exchanges on science-based stockpile stewardship with
Russia; encourage and enhance opportunities for bilateral cooperation
of law enforcement on a case-by-case basis; robustly support intelligence
efforts; pursue and prosecute nuclear smugglers to the fullest
extent of the law; and declare common policies on nuclear black
marketing and extradition with like-minded governments. 50 pp.

<B>The Prophets of Doom: The Security Threat of Religious Cults,<BR>
</B>by Andrew Hubback
<P>
<I>Occasional Paper</I>, No. 67, Institute for European Defence
and Strategic Studies<HR>

<P>
Andrew Hubback, a freelance writer and a commentator on security
affairs, examines the potential terrorist threat of some religious
cults. A recent example of such violence was the nerve gas attack
on the Tokyo subway by the Japanese religious cult <I>Aum Shinrikyo</I>
(Search for the Supreme Truth). The <I>Aum Shinrikyo</I> attack
was only part of growing trend of violence by religious cults
directed at forces of authority within states and targeted at
the general public. Religious cult terrorism introduces a new
aspect to terrorist warfare-their violence is as inspired by religion
as much as politics. Even the most violent secular terrorist groups
have eschewed such cruel weapons as nerve gas because they believe
such an attack would be counter productive to their political
cause. As recent peace settlements in certain hotspots in Central
America, the Middle East and Southern Africa have shown, former
terrorist groups have some common interests with their enemies.
Some fanatical apocalyptic religious cults have no such rational
ends as peace with those they see as their enemies. Hubback briefly
surveys violent cults throughout history and illustrates the recent
increase in cult terrorism. He then goes into detail about several
groups including <I>Aum Shinrikyo</I>, The Christian Identity
movement and the Oklahoma City bombing, and other international
cults such as the Order of the Solar Temple. He concludes with
suggestions on how to counter religious cult terrorism. He says
the first and most important step that should be taken is to recognize
the threat in the first place and be on guard. According to Hubback,
the security services of democracies should devote the necessary
resources to collecting intelligence on &quot;subversive, anti-social
and potentially violent cults. The authorities must be prepared
for a pre-emptive strike not only to protect the general public,
but to protect innocent cult members as well.  44 pp. CONTACT:

<B>Developing a Consensus for the Future: A Report of CSIS U.S.
China Policy Task Force</B><BR>
<P>
Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies<HR>

<P>
In 1994 the Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies (CSIS)
established the U.S. China Policy Task Force, co-chaired by Senators
Max Baucus (MT), Frank Murkowski (AK), Chuck Robb (VA), and Representative
Jim Kolbe (AZ), Harold Brown, a CSIS counselor, and Lawrason Thomas
of the Amoco Corporation. The Task Force has addressed several
issues affecting U.S.-China relations including: U.S.-China economic
and commercial relations; political issues including human rights;
domestic developments in the PRC, Hong Kong, and Taiwan; regional
security; and cross-strait relations. U.S.-China relations have
developed to a point where disputes over individual issues pose
a threat to the overall relationship between the two nations and
prevent a consistent and coherent bilateral policy. This report
covers four elements that the Task Force believes U.S.-China policy
should revolve around; 1) developing a new consensus to reestablish
executive branch leadership and bipartisan congressional support
in regards to the priorities of U.S.-China relations; 2) a new
consensus that reflects &quot;value propositions&quot; to promote
U.S. interests and give direction to the overall relationship;
3) striving within U.S. politics and policy to accommodate both
pragmatism and idealism; and 4) the new consensus should hold
a firm U.S. position concerning cross-strait relations that acknowledges
that Chinese on the mainland, and in Taiwan, maintain that there
is only one China. The rest of this report covers the issues of
economic and commercial relations, political and human rights
issues, and bilateral and regional security relations, with specific
recommendations. 93 pp. CONTACT: The Center for Strategic and

to Regulation, <BR></a></B>by Angela Antonelli
<P>
<I>F.Y.I.</I>, No. 116, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
Angela Antonelli, Deputy Director for Economic Policy Studies
at the Heritage Foundation, shows that the 104th Congress has
made several strides toward cutting regulatory red tape and began
to return common sense to regulation. However, she points out,
alarmists have been successful in convincing the American people
a reformed regulatory system would have disastrous consequences.
According to Antonelli, this Congress has a solid record of reforms
that will create a more flexible and less burdensome regulatory
system that will cost less and achieve the same or higher levels
of public health, safety, and environmental protection. 11 pp.

<br>
by John Barry 
<P>
<I>Committee Brief</I> No. 27, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
John Barry, Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation, calls for
the privatization of the two largest housing-related government
sponsored enterprises (GSEs), Federal National Mortgage Association
(Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie
Mac). Ongoing hearings on the subject have brought forth the diverse
opinions of different federal agencies over whether federal sponsorship
of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is necessary or not. Barry points
out that Congress is now considering privatization while at the
same time defending its oversight role. Barry says that Congress
should keep in mind two important facts to guide its decision
concerning the two GSEs: 1) Congress is ultimately responsible
for safeguarding the interests of taxpayers-so congressional oversight
of these GSEs is necessary if they remain government sponsored
as and place the taxpayer at risk; 2) the original mission of
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, establishing an efficient secondary
mortgage market, has been fulfilled-so Congress should end their
sponsorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Barry includes other
reasons for breaking the links between Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac, and the federal government: government intervention in the
mortgage credit markets is no longer necessary with the increased
availability of mortagages to all potential home buyers; the vast
size of the housing GSEs, due to federal guarantee, is a dangerous
presence in the capital markets; and the mixed private/public
nature of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac constitutes a conflict of
interest. 6 pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation,

</B>by Ken Weinstein and Thomas Wielgus
<P>
<I>Backgrounder</I>, No. 1087, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
In the 1988 case <I>Communications Workers of America v. Beck</I>,
the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that workers are entitled a refund
of the portion of their dues used for purposes other than collective
bargaining, contract administration, and grievance processes.
In 1992, President Bush issued an executive order requiring that
federal contractors post notices to inform workers of their Beck
rights. However, the Clinton Administration has rescinded this
order and has cooperated with union officials to keep workers
from knowing about these rights. The Worker Right to Know Act
is currently under consideration in Congress. The bill would require
unions to get permission from their members in order to use mandatory
dues for politicking or other activities outside of collective
bargaining. Weinstein and Wielgus argue that The Worker Right
to Know would enable union workers to exercise their rights freely.

<B>Competition in Electric Power: Strategies for Reform,</B>
<br>
by Doug Bandow
<P>
<I>Policy Report</I>, No. 14, John Locke Foundation<HR>

<P>
Doug Bandow, Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute, discusses deregulation
of the electric utility industries. Until the 1970s, it was assumed
that electric utilities were natural monopolies, and that electrical
service could not be provided through competitive markets. However,
examples of successful deregulation in the airline, banking, broadcasting,
energy, telephone and other utilities have made it less far fetched
to call for a similar deregulation of electric power. Steps toward
electric power deregulation have slowly been made since the disastrous
economy of the late 1970s shed light on the problems with electric
industry monopolies. In 1992 Congress mandated wholesale competition.
And by 1994 California and other states have even moved toward
retail competition. Bandow stresses the point that this process
of moving toward increased competition in the electricity industry
will not be without its difficulties. The complicated structure
of the system now as an enforced monopoly, with its state and
federal power subsidies, special regulatory impositions on utilities
for non-energy purposes, ownership restrictions of power companies,
and control of power grids, means that none of the issues can
be solved in isolation. Bandow calls for a federally planned and
enforced program to eliminate subsidies, contracts made under
the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act (PURPA) of 1978, non-energy
requirements, restrictions enforced under the Public Utility Holding
Company Act (PUCHA) of 1935, and control over access to transmission
grids while limiting stranded costs. This whole process will be
complicated politically and any change will generate opposition
from some interests. Bandow stresses that utilities deregulation
will be a significant factor in improving Americans' quality of
life in the early 21st Century. He concludes by saying that the
federal government, states, industry, consumer groups, and other
interests should work together to create a true market for electric
power that will provide Americans with better services at lower
costs. 62 pp.  CONTACT: The John Locke Foundation, P.O. Box 17822,

<B>Understanding Electricity Deregulation in Pittsburgh,</B>
<br>by Jake Haulk
<P>
Allegheny Institute<HR>

<P>
Jake Haulk, Research Director at the Allegheny Institute, discusses
how the deregulation of the nation's electric utilities holds
extremely large potential benefits in terms of lower prices and
higher quality of service for consumers. According to Haulk, regulation
as it is currently practiced is no longer appropriate for the
U.S. economy. &quot;Regulation encourages too much capital spending,
provides no inducement to cut costs and results in huge and wasteful
expenditures on litigation of prices and other regulated activities.&quot;
Steps have already been taken to ease the transition to deregulation.
For example, Haulk points out, federal agencies have mandated
that transmission grids of all competition at the wholesale level
will be open to all qualified generators. Retail deregulation
will soon follow this introduction of competition at the wholesale
level. Haulk also says that all customers will be able to choose
among a number of suppliers and have a choice of service levels
and price schedules in the new competitive system. Transmission
and distribution companies will be separately owned and probably
still regulated, but the generators and retail marketers will
be free to operate in a profit maximizing manner. He conservatively
estimates that a typical local residential customer in Allegheny
County will save about 30 percent, or $350 per year on electric
bills. 16 pp. CONTACT: Allegheny Institute for Public Policy,

<B>Promise and Peril: Implementing a Regulatory Budget,</B>
<br>
by Clyde Wayne Crews
<P>
<I>Regulatory Reform Project</I>, Competitive Enterprise Institute
<HR>

<P>
Clyde Wayne Crews, Fellow at the Competitive Enterprise Institute,
discusses the implementation of a Regulatory budget. He examines
the pluses and minuses of requiring Congress to set enforceable
limits on the amounts that federal agencies can force private
citizens to spend on federally mandated rules and regulations.
According to Crews, there currently exists a breach between rulemaking
and accountability. What he calls &quot;regulation without representation.&quot;
Congress loves to take credit for such legislation as the Clean
Air Act, but then blames the federal agencies, whose powers they
drastically increased with such legislation, for being &quot;out
of control.&quot; Meanwhile, the federal agency bureaucrats are
not accountable to voters. A regulatory budget would require Congress
to set and enforce cost caps on the regulations that the agencies
impose. Prioritizing what regulations bring the greatest benefits
and sensible protection would be a responsibility of Congress
and the agencies. Congress will become more accountable to the
voters for the costs and results of regulatory policy. Crews calls
for a few other steps to be taken to ensure that a budgeting effort
remains manageable and accountable. He calls for the establishment
of a regulatory cost freeze and the implementation of a &quot;Regulatory
Reduction Commission&quot; to address the existing $647 billion
regulatory enterprise; employing separate budgets for economic
and environmental/social regulation; and the controlling of hard-to-measure
indirect costs by abandoning the regulatory methods that most
often generate them. 28 pp. CONTACT: Competitive Enterprise Institute,

<B>How the Market Self-Polices Against Predatory Pricing,</B>

<P>
<I>Antitrust Reform Project</I>, Competitive Enterprise Institute
<HR>

<P>
Donald Boudreaux, Professor of Economics at Clemson University,
and Andrew Kleit, Professor of Economics at Louisiana State University,
argue that market forces are more effective than antitrust laws
in preventing monopolies from occurring. Kleit and Boudreaux argue
that economic research shows that predatory pricing is not likely
to result in a monopoly. Rival competitors have the incentive
and the ability to withstand a predatory price war. They maintain
that customers and suppliers of the predatory prices often have
the incentive and ability to thwart predatory efforts. Some elements
of antitrust law serve to thwart market forces of policing against
predation. Lawful 'private policing' strategies such as minimum
resale price maintenance, maximum resale price maintenance, and
price discrimination are rendered unlawful as a perverse consequence
of antitrust law. Antitrust prohibitions then increase the costs
of private firms of protecting themselves from monopoly. 20 pp.

<HR>

<P>
In a joint publication, the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution,
and the Institute for Policy Innovation, present a list of the
top ten worst government regulations. In the introduction, Robert
Kasten, former Senator from Wisconsin, and Chairman of the Center
on Regulation and Economic Growth for the Alexis de Tocqueville
Institution, points out that government regulators frequently
far exceed the original intent of Congress when enforcing regulation.
Without &quot;sunset&quot; provisions, regulations stay in effect
even after they have become obsolete or outdated. To compile this
list, IPI and AdTI asked leading policy experts to write a brief
article on what they believed exemplified the worst regulations
from Washington. Kasten proposes that the regulations would be
perfect candidates for Congressional overhaul or elimination during
the next &quot;Corrections Day.&quot; Those ten regulations are:
the federal wetlands policy; the 60-40 rule; off-label drug use
regulations; the federal peanut program; the FDA's slow approval
process; Superfund; Environmental Tobacco Smoke; The Delaney Clause;
Discipline of special education students; and Toxic Release Inventory.

<B>The Impact of Enterprise Zones, <BR>
</B>by Terry Van Allen<HR>

<P>
Enterprise Zones are set aside low-income areas that have reduced
tax and regulatory barriers in order to stimulate economic development,
investment, and opportunity. Terry Van Allen, Director of Research
Initiatives at the University of Houston-Clear Lake, examines
the issue of how Enterprise Zones affect employment. He argues
that Enterprise Zones have a major impact on reducing unemployment.
His study also shows that vast majority of the new entry level
jobs go to the residents of the low-income zone, contrary to the
claims of critics. He also dispels the myth that most businesses
relocate to Enterprise Zones from other communities. Instead,
the evidence shows that most of the businesses in Enterprise Zones
have either been expanded or newly created from &quot;within&quot;
the designated communities. He also counters the argument that
the cost of providing tax incentives is too high. Van Allen argues
that poverty areas already have low tax revenues and high welfare
costs, so the benefits far outweigh the costs. The analytical
model that Van Allen has created projects that the designated
poverty areas on average can reach employment rate parity with
the surrounding more-prosperous communities within twelve years.
He recommends that the Clinton Administration and Congress increase
the number of Enterprise Zones and provide for capital gains tax
incentives within Enterprise Zones. 145 pp. CONTACT: Austin &amp;

<B>Is New York City Killing Entrepreneurship? </B><br>
by William Mellor
<P>
Institute for Justice<HR>

<P>
The Institute for Justice examines how New York City has made
it hard for self-employed entrepreneurs to pursue productive livelihoods.
New York's regulatory system is filled with entrepreneurs who
find that if they were to comply with the law, they would have
to abandon their way of making an honest living. The underground
economy in New York City now may represent as much as 20 percent
of the city's overall economy. This report looks at the government-created
barriers of licensing and permitting laws and public monopolies,
and their effect on entry-level entrepreneurship in New York.
They illustrate how obstacles to enterprise created by government
often times far exceed any legitimate exercise of government authority
to regulate in order to protect health and safety. IJ also focuses
on the tragedy, as well as the heroic efforts of those who try
to earn an honest living, despite the burden of senseless rules
and requirements whose main purpose seems to be to limit competition
in particular occupations. Finally, IJ makes recommendations for
how to create easier legal entry into entrepreneurial endeavors.

</B>by Bill Beach
<P>
<I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1091, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
As long as governments have been collecting taxes, the death of
well-to-do individuals has been a lucrative moment for tax collectors.
The manifestation of such a tax today is the estate tax. Except
the estate tax effects more than just the wealthy, with the hardest
hit being small business owners. Bill Beach, John M. Olin Senior
Fellow in Economics, puts forth the case for repealing the estate
tax, and identifies it as the &quot;worst tax of all.&quot; According
to Beach, the social and economic costs of the estate tax far
exceeds the revenue that it brings to the government. Growing
evidence shows that the estate tax: reduces economic growth, and
hurts the incomes of the people that wealth redistribution was
intended to aid; it increases the cost of capital, this slows
down research and development and the investment in machines that
would increase worker productivity instead-and thus wages; it
keeps the interest rates on home loans and other major purchases
unnecessarily high; and it does not raise very much money-and
may, in fact, cost government and taxpayers more in administrative
and compliance fees than it raises in revenue. Using two leading
econometric models, a Heritage Foundation study found that the
repeal of the estate tax would have a large and beneficial effect
on the economy. According to the analysis, if the tax were repealed
this year, over the next nine years: America's economy would average
as much as $11 billion per year in extra output; an average of
145,000 additional new jobs could be created; personal income
could rise by an average of $8 billion per year above current
projections; and the deficit would actually decline with the revenues
generated by extra growth. Beach points out that that estate tax
has few friends other than tax attorneys. 30 pp. CONTACT: Chris

</B> 
<br>
by Dan Mitchell
<P>
<I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1090, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
Dan Mitchell, McKenna Senior Fellow in Political Economy, explains
how dynamic scoring should be used to modernize the revenue-estimating
process. Dynamic scoring recognizes that tax policy effects the
economy, as opposed to static analysis, which assumes that tax
changes have no impact on economic growth. Mitchell argues that
dynamic scoring, if used properly, can help bring about sound
tax policy by reducing the politically unpleasant side-effects
of tax cuts. Static analysis does not take into account the fact
that a larger economy created by easing a tax burden brings in
larger revenue to government coffers. Politicians usually support
the idea of cutting taxes. However, they are afraid of being blamed
for the higher deficits that static analysis predicts will happen
with tax cuts. Mitchell lists several points that policy makers
should consider when taking steps to modernize the revenue-estimating
process: learn from history that static scoring overestimates
how much revenue will be generated by a tax increase, while underestimating
the revenue feedback that pro-growth tax changes will generate;
realize that dynamic analysis is not perfect, as opposed to static
analysis which is guaranteed to give the wrong answer; tax cuts
that have a greater effect on behavior, such as a capital gains
tax cut have a greater revenue feedback effect; policy makers
should insist that taxpayers get full disclosure on whatever model
and methodology is used by revenue estimators at the Joint Committee
on Taxation and the Treasury Department; have the goal of tax
policy be the maximization of growth, not tax revenue; and include
the estimated private and governmental compliance costs of taxation.
Mitchell concludes by saying that dynamic forecasting is based
on a proper understanding of how the economy works, and that history
has shown this approach to be more realistic. 17 pp. CONTACT:

This report from Cato presents an objective, comparative analysis
of the spending and tax policies of 46 state governors. Stephen
Moore, Director of Fiscal Policy Studies, and Dean Stansel, Fiscal
Policy Analyst at the Cato Institute, constructed a 14-variable
index of fiscal performance and applied it to the records of each
governor who took office before 1993. The authors then graded
each of the governors on their fiscal conservatism. George Pataki
of New York, Steve Merrill of New Hampshire, and Fife Symington
of Arizona, received the grade of &quot;A.&quot; Gaston Caperton
of West Virginia, Tom Carper of Delaware, Lawton Chiles of Florida,
and George Voinovich of Ohio received &quot;F's.&quot; A significant
trend that was uncovered by the study was that states have become
more fiscally conservative since 1994, and the new governors as
a class tend to be more fiscally conservative than those elected
before 1993. 84 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts

<B>Accounting for Growth: Incorporating Dynamic Analysis Into
Revenue Estimation, <BR>
</B>by Gary Robbins and Aldona Robbins
<P>
<I>Policy Report</I> No. 138, Institute for Policy Innovation
<HR>

<P>
Gary Robbins, John M. Olin Senior Research Fellow at the Institute
for Policy Innovation, and Aldona Robbins, Bradley Senior Research
Fellow at the Institute for Policy Innovation, examine the issue
of &quot;dynamic analysis.&quot; Dynamic economic analysis is
the process of estimating economic changes that occur because
of changes in tax policy. It does not assume that all economic
behavior and variables remain the same if tax laws or government
expenditures change. Robbins and Robbins used dynamic analysis
with three hypothetical changes: a per capita tax of $5,200; an
elimination of the capital gains and dividend taxes on individuals;
and a uniform rate for individual and corporate income taxes of
19 percent, all with a commonly accepted baseline of 2.5 percent
annual growth from 1996 to 2010. They found that the head tax
raises GDP 22 percent above baseline by 2010. By removing individual
capital gain/dividend taxes raises GDP 8.5 percent, and the 19
percent uniform rate puts real GDP 7.5 percent above baseline
by 2010. Their use of dynamic analysis suggests tax reform aimed
at growth can increase annual output roughly 10 to 15 percent.
This boost would lead to more jobs, higher incomes, and an expanded
tax base which would bring higher revenues, not losses. 19 pp.

<B>The Hidden Heir: How Estate Taxes Are Swallowing up Family
Businesses And Farms-And How We Can Stop It</B>
<P>
Public Policy Institute of New York<HR>

<P>
The Public Policy Institute of New York examines the detrimental
effects of New York's state-level estate and gift taxes. With
federal estate taxes, and the additional burden of New York state's
top rates reaching 76 percent, owners of family businesses and
farms are often times forced to flee New York when they retire,
taking valuable assets with them. Most states do not add to federal
estate taxes, but simply take some of the tax that otherwise would
go to the federal government. New York collects the most revenue
of the states that do levy estate or inheritance taxes and has
the highest top rates on inheritance to children. Contrary to
the nationwide trend of states repealing their death taxes, New
York has been expanding its estate tax. This paper argues that
New York must reduce its rates, reduce the burden of the state
gift tax; conform estate tax credits to the federal level; and
make policy changes that can ease the transfer of family businesses
from one generation to the next. Finally, this paper argues that
New York could go further than a reduction in disadvantages, and
create an actual incentive for family businesses to locate in
New York state. By establishing a New York Sate Family Business
Fund, the fund could loan family businesses and farms money to
pay federal estate taxes. It would be capitalized with a small
share of exiting estate revenue flow-so that revenues from the
rich would pay for keeping family businesses and their jobs in
New York. 27 pp. CONTACT: The Public Policy Institute of New York

<B>Public-Private Promises #1: Three Rivers Stadium,</B><br>
by Grant Gulibon
<P>
<I>Report</I>, No. 96-14 Allegheny Institute<HR>

<P>
In light of the proposal to build a new government subsidized
baseball stadium in Pittsburgh, Grant Gulibon, Research Associate
at the Allegheny Institute, examines the rosy promises made in
a similar proposal approximately thirty-five years ago for Three
Rivers Stadium. Gulibon's report examines the claims used to justify
the construction of Three Rivers Stadium and contrasts them with
the stadium's actual performance since its opening. He found:
the original estimated cost of the stadium was $13.8 million,
while its final cost is estimated to be between $52 and $62 million;
the 83.5 acre site where the stadium was built was estimated to
cost $10 million in 1958, re-estimated to cost $21.72 in 1962,
but ultimately cost $45 million; Three Rivers Stadium was to be
a &quot;self-financing&quot; project which would not require city
or county operating support, but, has run up a $43 million deficit,
and has received operating subsidies for the Allegheny County
Regional Asset District; very little of the predicted private
development plans for the area surrounding the stadium exists
due to a lack of market demand; Through 1991 the city had over
$100 million on the stadium, still owes $40 million on the bonds
floated for the original construction, and had provided $27.1
million in subsidies for stadium operating deficits over the same
time period; deficits continued even after the stadium authority
hired a private management group to manage Three Rivers in 1982;
and St. Louis' Busch Stadium, four years older than Three Rivers
and nearly identical in size and design, privately financed and
has been privately owned and operated since it opened, was completed
under budget, has turned a profit each year since it opened, and
has been cited by baseball officials as one of the model facilities
in operation today. 19 pp. CONTACT: Allegheny Institute, 7 Parkway

<B>Restoring Opportunity to Arkansas: Changing a &quot;Tax and
Spend&quot; State to a &quot;Save and Invest&quot; State,</B>
<br>
by Stephen Moore and Dean Stansel
<P>
Arkansas Policy Foundation
<P>
Stephen Moore, Director of Fiscal Policy Studies at the Cato Institute,
and Dean Stansel, Fiscal Policy Analyst at Cato, discuss how changing
the tax policy in the state of Arkansas, would restore opportunity
to the state. In Arkansas, tax and spending has exploded over
the past fifteen years. Moore and Stansel list several examples
of Arkansas' heavy taxation: state spending is 50% higher than
it was in 1980-and spending has risen 12% faster than state income
in the same period; if the state budget had only grown at the
rate of personal income growth, Arkansas could both balance its
budget and give every family in the state a $1,000 tax rebate;
Arkansas' high tax burden is 15% above the national average, and
is weakening the state's competitiveness with other states; spending
priorities have been radically rewritten since 1980, from traditional
state responsibilities such as education, highways, and hospitals
to less productive and more redistributive goals such as welfare,
public health, and debt service; and that the state budget has
been growing at an annual rate more than twice that of inflation.
To solve these tax problems, Moore and Stansel offer the following
spending restraints and tax cuts: a 25% cut in personal income
tax rates, eventually to become a 5% flat tax to deliver economic
growth; indexation, which prevents state government from benefiting
through inflation; eliminate the state capital gains tax on new
investment, to have a giant impact on investment and job growth;
enact a one-year budget freeze to allow the rest of the state
to catch up; and finally, implement a constitutional budget cap
that prevents growth of spending from rising faster than the growth
rate of the state population plus inflation. Moore and Stansel
conclude that such measures have led to stunning economic success
in states as  different as Massachusetts, Michigan, and New Jersey.

<B>Taxation and Economic Performance, <BR>
</B>by W. Kurt Hauser
<P>
<I>Essay in Public Policy</I>, Hoover Institution<HR>

<P>
Kurt Hauser, President of a San Francisco investment management
firm, argues that increased tax rates do not raise the desired
additional revenues. In his essay he shows that the economy as
a whole tends to perform worse following a tax increase. Reduction
in tax rates, however, tends to make the economy perform more
favorably. Hauser notes that economists have debated for the past
two centuries over whether or not higher rates of taxation leads
to increased levels of government revenues. More recently, he
points out, the revenue generation forecast for the tax increase
of 1990 and 1993 fell short of the mark. According to Hauser,
higher tax rates tend to reduce the tax base because of the disincentives
that they cause to work, produce, save, or invest. There are also
incentives to hide, shelter, and underreport income when tax rates
are raised. Policy makers still continue to believe that increases
in marginal tax rates will raise revenues without the adverse
effects on economic growth, job creation, or standard of living.

<B>Operating on American Health Care: Will Free Market Reforms
Survive? </B>
<P>
<I>F.Y.I.</I>, American Legislative Exchange Council<HR>

<P>
This issue of <I>F.Y.I.</I> examines how free-market reforms concerning
health care have grown since the failure of the Clinton health
care proposals. According to ALEC, states are repealing the bad
reforms associated with Clinton Care, such as, community rating,
guaranteed issue, price controls, and managed competition. States
are now busy dealing with the massive managed-care systems and
protecting patient's rights. Instead of the centralized systems
of Clinton style reforms, states are moving toward market solutions
that allow choice to the patients and better overall care. !8
states have enacted laws allowing for medical savings accounts
(MSAs). Also in this issue, Dr. Merrill Mathews, Health Policy
Director at the National Center for Policy Analysis, discusses
solving the portability problem. He says that the problem should
be resolved without costing the federal government additional
money or distorting the health insurance market. States should
provide risk pools for uninsurable individuals. Kim Pacelli, ALEC
Research Assistant, briefly examines how states might reform Medicaid
programs if block grants are granted to states. More than 40 states
have already sought waivers from the federal government. 19 pp.

<B>Multicultural Mental Health: Does Your Skin Color Matter More
than Your Mind? <BR>
</B>by Sally Satel and Greg Forster
<P>
<I>Policy Brief</I>, Center for Equal Opportunity<HR>

<P>
Sally Satel, a psychiatrist and lecturer with the Yale University
School of Medicine, and Greg Forster, Policy Analyst at the Center
for Equal Opportunity, examine a new mental health field called
&quot;cultural competence&quot; or &quot;multicultural therapy.&quot;
According to Satel and Forster, this movement threatens to discredit
traditional therapy and replace it with identity politics. This
concept of therapy sees human behavior as primarily culture-dependent.
So according to the theory of this practice doctors and patients
will experience mistrust and miscommunication if they are of different
racial or ethnic groups. It also assumes that white therapists
are racist. San Francisco General Hospital has the most prominent
cultural competence program in the United States. The doctors
in the mental health unit there specialize in different patient
groups-blacks, Asians, Latinos, gays/lesbians/bisexuals, women,
and HIV-positive. The city of San Francisco has even created a
racial specialization for non-doctor health professionals: African
American Health Services Specialists. The authors argue that no
one believes that race and culture are irrelevant to mental health,
but that muticultural therapy seeks to establish rigid rules of
treatment based on stereotypes and groupthink. They conclude that
the patient is a human being, not a cultural puppet, and that
multicultural approach to psychotherapy spends more energy separating
patients into groups than treating them. 19 pp. CONTACT: Center

<B>Waiting Your Turn: Hospital Waiting Lists in Canada,</B>

<I>Critical Issues Bulletin</I>, Fraser Institute<HR>

<P>
Cynthia Ramsey, Health Economist at The Fraser Institute, and
Michael Walker, Executive Director of The Fraser Institute, present
the Institute's sixth attempt to examine and document the extent
to which waiting lists are being used as a way of adapting to
the conflict between limited budgetary allocations and the potentially
unlimited demand for free health care. This year's results show
that Canadians waited longer in 1995 than in 1994 to receive medical
treatment. They found that patients in 1995 waited longer-10.2
weeks from referral by a general practitioner to a specialist
until the receipt of treatment-compared to 9.7 weeks in 1994.
They also found that the number of people on surgical waiting
lists and the amount of time they are waiting for the treatment
varies from province to province. Patients in Prince Edward Island
wait almost two months longer for surgical procedures than people
in Quebec. Fraser's survey measured what specialists consider
to be clinically reasonable amounts of time to wait for surgical
procedures. In almost every instance, the responding specialist
thought that patients were waiting too long for treatment. Ramsey
and Walker conclude that a plausible explanation for the waiting
times is that governments are using them as a way to control health
care expenses by rationing access to health care.  58 pp. CONTACT:

<B>Repairing the Ladder: Toward a New Housing Policy Paradigm,
</B>
<br>by Howard Husock
<P>
<I>Policy Study</I>, No. 207, Reason Foundation<HR>

<P>
In this report, Howard Husock, Reason Foundation Adjunct Scholar,
examines the reasons why housing policy for the poor has not worked.
He lays out an overall plan and specific details for an new housing
policy paradigm that is based on ongoing, already successful initiatives.
He argues that the problems of public housing and related subsidy
programs is partly a result of a fundamental misunderstanding
of the role which housing plays in social and economic life. He
also argues that replacement policies that emphasized subsidized
rentals risk creating a new generation of problems and complications,
including the further undermining of the social structure of civil
society in poor neighborhoods. According to Husock, housing must
be seen as more than a physical good, and viewed as part of a
social system. or &quot;housing ladder.&quot; The housing ladder
concept relies on the notion that to best serve the most people,
the fullest range of privately owned housing types must be built.
The desire of the occupants of housing to move up the ladder from
one type to another, and the need to protect the value of one's
housing investment, plays a key role in maintaining the social
fabric of neighborhoods, especially very poor neighborhoods. Husock's
concept of the housing ladder comes from historical data that
indicates that private, owner-occupied housing has played a key
role in the lives of those of modest means. He uses examples of
private, public and nonprofit initiatives which have begun to
build or facilitate the construction of the housing that regulation
or deep subsidy programs have made difficult to build in recent
years, that can lead the way to a new housing paradigm. 66 pp.

<P>
Abraham Ellis, a New York City attorney, illustrates that Social
Security is just another entitlement program, not an insurance
system. He also shows that the Trust fund is an &quot;economic
house of cards.&quot; The payments are continuously being raised
regardless of a retiree's contributions. Meanwhile, the receipts
from the Social Security tax go into general government revenue.
Ellis points out, that in the event of a real economic crisis,
the government would have trouble meeting its obligations to elderly
Americans that depend on it. According to Ellis, Social Security
is unfair to prudent young people who could produce much more
for retirement by investing the amount that goes into social security
taxes. Overall, Ellis shows that Social Security is just another
way for getting additional taxes from the people. 208 pp.  CONTACT:

that Social Security either is in trouble today or will be in
trouble within the next 20 years; 60 percent of all Americans
under the age 65 believe that Social Security will not be there
for them when they retire; voters reject most traditional Social
Security reforms such as raising the retirement age, raising payroll
taxes, or reducing benefits; and approximately two-thirds of voters
would support privatization of Social Security, and transforming
it into a privatized mandatory savings program. 7 pp. CONTACT:

the New York Association of Scholars and the Empire Foundation

the State University of New York. They discovered a nationwide
trend in whereby students take an odd mixture of courses that
do not build on previous knowledge, while avoiding more fundamental
and serious subjects. For example, one campus mandates that students
take courses in physical education while at the same time does
not require courses in history, literature, philosophy, arts,
English composition, mathematics or science. In addition, intellectual
permissiveness and political correctness are running rampant on
these campuses with courses such as, &quot;Literature of Sports,&quot;Deviance,&quot;
&quot;Love and Sexuality,&quot; and &quot;Stage Combat.&quot;

<B>Charter Schools in Action: What Have We Learned?</B><br>

<P>
Hudson Institute<HR>

<P>
Finn, Manno and Bierlein report their findings from the first
year of a two-year Hudson Institute study of U.S. charter schools.
The report focuses on the schools' start-up problems, solutions
to those problems, and the policy environments in which such schools
are most apt to thrive or falter. Start-up problems, not surprisingly,
include financial burdens and regulatory and political hurdles.
Among the many recommendations the writers make are setting up
charter schools to be legal entities in their own right, giving
charter schools the same per pupil operating funds that conventional
public schools receive, and using the charter model to develop
ways of holding all public schools accountable for their results.
Hudson suggests that charter schools may be the most vibrant force
in American education today and notes that the current demand
for charter schools far outweighs the supply. 127 pp.  CONTACT:

<B>The New Paradigm on Environmental Enforcement: Environmental
Audit Privilege and Immunity Legislation,</B>
<br>by R. Kinnan Golemon and Laura Wolf
<P>
<I>The State Factor</I>, Vol. 22, No. 1, American Legislative
Exchange Council<HR>

<P>
R. Kinnan Golemon, a prominent expert in the field of Environmental
Law, and Laura Wolf, an environmental lawyer in Austin, present
a new paradigm for environmental enforcement. For the last twenty-five
years environmental regulation has focused on the &quot;command
and control&quot; model. Golemon and Wolf argue that this model,
which has developed an extremely complicated regulatory scheme,
is outdated and needs to change. They believe that a new environmental
regulatory model should focus on and encourage voluntary compliance.
Goleman and Wolf present &quot;audit privileges and penalty immunities&quot;
as part of the solution. These give an incentive for regulated
entities to conduct environmental audits without the fear of major
sanctions. The audits will promote candid, effective discussions
within the regulated entities to help find the causes of, and
the solution to, environmental noncompliance. They will also remove
the incentive to not identify or hide noncompliance so that the
problem can be solved in the most constructive possible way. 13

<B>Privatizing the Public Lands, <BR>
</B>by B. Delworth Gardner
<P>
<I>Focus on Utah</I>, No. 1, Sutherland Institute<HR>

<P>
B. Delworth Gardner, Professor Emeritus of Economics at Brigham
Young University, argues that the federal government should dispose
of its public land in the West, and permit private parties to
own and control the land itself. According to Gardner, private
management is superior to public management in conserving resources.
In economic markets, the future generations are represented by
entrepreneurs who will profit from, and are most interested in,
conserving resources for their future use. She continues by stressing
that consumers and taxpayers are the beneficiaries if market products,
in this case, land use user fees, are priced at competitive levels.
Although some public management products appear to be free or
subsidized, taxpayers must pay for such things as the lobbying,
campaign contributions, propaganda, and court costs that are incurred
in order to influence public decisions. Privatization and market
allocation at a price would make it so each consumer would pay
for what he gets. Resources would be more productive, and products
would increase in variety in order to be tailored toward consumer
tastes. If private entrepreneurs marketed hunting and fishing
privileges, they would manage the resources more efficiently and
more successfully. Private firms also have a greater incentive
to stop undesirable managerial behavior than government bureaucrats.
Finally, Gardner argues that the federal government should gradually
dispose of the public lands, and they should try alternative ways
for privatizing the public lands, such as long-term competitive
leasing of public lands to private groups. 17 pp. CONTACT: Sutherland

John Tottie, Senior Economist for Tax and Budget at Citizens for
a Sound Economy, examines the $47 billion in research and development
(R&amp;D) spending by the Department of Energy (DOE)-supposedly
for the benefit of taxpayers and the U.S. economy. In the early
days of the 104th Congress, DOE published &quot;Success Stories:
The Energy Mission in the Marketplace,&quot; highlighting what
the department thought were its successes in applied energy research
and development. The 22 page report seems like an attempt to fight
off the much needed reductions in the bloated spending by DOE
on R&amp;D. Tottie argues that the private industry that stands
to benefit from the R&amp;D spending, not taxpayers, should be
responsible for the costs associated with developing scientific
knowledge that has specific commercial applications.  8 pp. CONTACT:

<P>
The Competitive Enterprise Institute commissioned <I>The Polling
Company</I> to perform a nationwide poll of 1,000 registered voters
nationwide. They found that most Americans support environmental
protection, but are not activists. They also found that most Americans
support a greater role for state and local governments in environmental
policy, and that state and local governments are better suited
at addressing environmental concerns than the federal government.
According to the survey, most Americans see devolution, regulatory
reform, and property rights as being consistent with environmental
protection. Also, Americans see nothing anti-environment about
alternative approaches to environmental policy. CEI argues that
the challenge for supporters of environmental regulatory reform
is to articulate a vision for the future of environmental policy
that combines the public's concern for environmental protection
with their preference for limited government policies. Americans
have come to realize that extensive federal bureaucracies are
not necessary to advance environmental protection, and that pursuing
environmental reform is not &quot;anti-environment.&quot; 25 pp.

<B>A New Environmental Tool? Assessing Life Cycle Assessment,
</B> 
<br>
by Mark Duda and Jane Shaw
<P>
<I>Contemporary Issues Series</I>, No. 81, Center for the Study
of American Business<HR>

<P>
&quot;Life cycle assessment&quot; (LCA) is a process that attempts
to measure the total environmental impact of a product and its
manufacturing process. Mark Duda, Fellow at the Political Economy
Research Center (PERC), and Jane Shaw, a Senior Associate of PERC,
discuss the reasons why this procedure should not be used to shape
public policy. According to Duda and Shaw, LCA is useful to companies
that want to know whether the raw material they use might become
scarce or become environmentally harmful. When companies use LCA
their data is generally reliable and their goals are usually clear.
If such procedures were used for public policy and regulatory
purposes, argue Duda and Shaw, it would require that practitioners
use data from a wide range of sources and then translate this
data into environmental impacts. The averages and aggregates produced
would be inaccurate and would not describe the differences between
one product and another. According to Duda and Shaw, it is hard
to translate resource consumption and emissions data into actual
environmental impacts. For example it does not take into consideration
the environment in which production occurs. Overall, they conclude,
LCA makes sense for individual firms, which use it to plan how
they will respond to environmental regulations and to the environmental
concerns of their customers. If LCA information is collected at
the industry level it is not sufficiently accurate for making
broad public policy decisions.  20 pp. CONTACT: Center for the

<B>A Turf Fight for Indoor Air Quality Protection, <BR>
</B>by Dwight Lee
<P>
<I>Contemporary Issues Series</I>, No. 79, Center for the Study
of American Business<HR>

<P>
Dwight Lee, an Adjunct Fellow for the Center for the Study of
American Business, discusses the bureaucratic turf war over the
control and regulation of indoor air. The Occupational Safety
and Health Administration (OSHA) has jurisdiction over workplace
safety and is in a fight with the Environmental Protection Agency
over jurisdiction of indoor air quality (IAQ) in the workplace.
The agency that is able to gain control over IAQ will be in a
good position to expand its budget and power. According to Lee,
EPA and OSHA are using the political issue of tobacco smoke to
muscle for their larger budgets. OSHA has made a proposal to ban
smoking in all work sites under its jurisdiction. According to
Lee, OSHA's position relies on flawed and biased studies that
emphasize that indoor pollution can be addressed by singling out
particular pollutants such as tobacco smoke. In reality, indoor
air pollution is a general problem that cannot be effectively
dealt with by singling out particular pollutants. Lee argues that
OSHA ignores cost saving alternative approaches, ignores the advantages
of market incentives and exaggerates the benefits of regulation.
Overall, it exploits the politically contentious issue of tobacco
to grab for more power. Lee concludes that the only argument that
can be made for OSHA IAQ regulation is that it would be no more
inefficient than EPA regulation.  16 pp. CONTACT: Center for the

Bruce Yandle, an Adjunct Fellow at The Progress &amp; Freedom
Foundation, Andy Barnett, Associate Professor of Economics at
Auburn University, and Mark Brandly, a doctoral candidate in economics
at Auburn, call for the creation of Environmental Innovation Areas
(EIAs). EIAs will recognize that different regions face different
environmental and pollution problems. Different regions should
be given flexibility to meet clean air requirements in ways that
are best suited for their particular area, instead of the top-down
command and control system that we currently have. Yandle, Barnett
and Brandly call for an end to federal fuel taxes that discriminate
against alternative fuels. With EIAs, states and regions could
design fuel taxes that encourage the appropriate use of cleaner
burning fuels for their area. Changing the laws that discriminate
against alternative fuel vehicles will be a lower cost way to
improve automobile efficiency and a reduction in American reliance
on imported petroleum than Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE)
standards. 57 pp. CONTACT: Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation,

<B>The Privatization Process: A Worldwide Perspective,</B>
<br>
Edited by Terry Anderson and Peter Hill<HR>

<P>
The editors of this collection of essays, Terry Anderson, Executive
Director of PERC (the Political Economy Research Center), and
Peter Hill, a Senior Associate of PERC, argue that the 1980s and
1990s will be remembered in history as the era of privatization.
The trend of privatization, which was in part, inspired by the
collapse of the former Soviet Union, is being hotly debated throughout
American government. This book is a collection of original essays
by distinguished scholars that examine the potential benefits,
as well as the possible pitfalls, of national and global privatization.
This book also provides several perspective on how privatization
can best be achieved. With the support of empirical evidence,
the various authors asses the institutional changes and economic
impact of this worldwide trend. 270 pp. CONTACT: Rowman &amp;

by Bob Moffit and Ed Meese
<P>
<I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1089, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
Bob Moffit, Deputy Director of Domestic Policy Studies at The
Heritage Foundation, and Ed Meese, former Attorney General of
The United States and Ronald Reagan Distinguished Fellow at The
Heritage Foundation, present twenty-one steps that public officials
can take to support their local police. Moffit and Meese draw
upon the success of former New York City Commissioner of Police
William Bratton's short tenure, in which serious crime dropped
36 percent, including a 44 percent drop in auto theft and a 45
percent drop in murder. A reduction in crime does not depend upon
new cars or computers, more officers and bigger budgets. What
is most important, this paper says, is solid personnel management
and a clear mission for combating crime and disorder, with support
from the public, the state and the courts, and the press. Moffit
and Meese give the following suggestions for specific ways that
local officials can strengthen their police forces through their
own efforts: police should have a more back to basics role; police
should combat minor &quot;disorder&quot; crimes that provide an
environment for more serious crimes; raise the standards for who
can become a police officer; improve police compensation; target
hot spots; and reduce caseloads for detectives, among other suggestions.
Moffit and Meese call on the federal government to: block the
appointment of federal judges who demonstrate an insensitivity
to public safety; review federal statutes dealing with crime,
and repeal the ones that impinge on the legitimate authority of
local and state law enforcement officials; review the impact of
the <I>Miranda</I> ruling; and pursue ways through enterprise
zones to revitalize inner-city neighborhoods among other suggestions.
Overall, states and localities need maximum flexibility to combat
violent crime. 37 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage

<I>Government Integrity Project Report</I>, No. 10, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
Ken Weinstein, Director of the Government Reform Project at the
Heritage Foundation, reports that under the Clinton Administration
a string of federal grants have continued to subsidize the Laborers'
International Union of North America (LIUNA) even as government
investigators were uncovering evidence of organized criminal influence
in the union. Weinstein argues that restrictions or elimination
of grants to politically active groups such as unions should be
seriously considered by Congress. Meanwhile, Congress should act
immediately to: require that relevant grantmakers at certain federal
bureaus testify about their knowledge of allegations of criminal
infiltration of LIUNA; prohibit organizations whose officers have
records of criminal wrongdoing from receiving federal grants;
renew efforts to restrict lobbying by federal grantees; and order
a General Accounting Office investigation into LIUNA's handling
of federal grants. Weinstein concludes by pointing out that it
is bad enough that mandatory dues from union members are used
to pay for corruption and political activities, tax payers should
not have to pay as well. 9 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The

<B>Civil Right and Sexual Behavior: An Analysis of the Employment
Non-Discrimination Act, <BR>
</B>by Paul Mero
<P>
<I>Insight</I>, Family Research Council<HR>

<P>
Paul Mero, a political consultant and congressional staffer, examines
how the Employment Non-Discrimination Act might lead to the adoption
of the entire homosexual rights agenda. He argues that organized
homosexuality, the political pragmatic side of the homosexuality
movement, has narrowly worded this bill as a calculated risk that
the final determination of this legislation will rest on some
very fundamental notions about homosexuality <I>per se</I>, and
whether or not mainstream America will accept these notions. According
to Mero, the narrowly worded language of the legislation is very
ambiguous and includes the curious term &quot;bisexual.&quot;
Mero says this term is one of the calculated risks with which
organized homosexuality is testing mainstream America. &quot;Bisexual,&quot;
is a person that has sex with both men and women. Unlike the word
&quot;lesbianism&quot; or &quot;homosexuality,&quot; which some
of the public can accept as possibly genetic traits, bisexuality
cannot be taken seriously, according to Mero. He argues that amending
the 1964 Civil Rights Act with the word &quot;bisexual&quot; would
be the same as society granting its crowning approval of promiscuous
sexual activity and to renounce marriage and traditional mores.
It would be no different than implying that promiscuity is a genetic
trait. Or it seriously confuses behavior with orientation. Mero
concludes by showing how organized homosexuality has exploited
the Hate Crimes Bill to further their agenda. They did it claiming
victimhood, confusing homosexuality with innate human properties
such as skin color, using bogus studies to support quantitative
claims of discrimination, winning the endorsement of former &quot;conservative&quot;
Republicans, and taking the media along for the ride with their
disregard for facts. Many of the same components exist for the
Employment Non-Discrimination Act. 17 pp. CONTACT: Family Research

<B>Feminist Jurisprudence: Equal Rights or Neo-Paternalism?</B>
<br>by Michael Weiss and Cathy Young
<P>
<I>Policy Analysis</I> No. 256, Cato Institute<HR>

<P>
Cato Associate Policy Analyst, Cathy Young, and University of
Houston Law Professor, Michael Weiss, argue that the rise of feminist
jurisprudence has gone far beyond the original and widely supported
goal of equal treatment for both sexes. According to Young and
Weiss, the new feminist legal theory agenda is to redistribute
power from the &quot;dominant class&quot; (men) to the &quot;subordinate
class&quot; (women), while such key concepts of Western jurisprudence
as judicial neutrality and individual rights are declared to be
patriarchal fictions designed to protect male privilege. Some
feminist-initiated legal reforms have addressed real wrongs such
as the inadequate protection for victims of domestic violence.
However, say Young and Weiss, feminist legal theory has resulted
in increasingly loose and subjective definitions of harassment
and rape, dangerous moves to eviscerate the presumption of innocence
in sexual assault cases, and a broad concept of self-defense in
cases of battered wives. The authors conclude that Courts and
legislatures should not limit individual rights and reaffirm the
fundamental principle of the classical liberal origins of the
movement for women's rights: equality before the law regardless
of gender. 63 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts

by Christine Olson and Robert Rector
<P>
<I>Issue Bulletin</I>, No. 228, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
According to Christine Olson, Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation,
and Robert Rector, Senior Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation,
The American Community Renewal Act of 1996 (H.R. 3467) will promote
the moral renewal and economic revitalization of America's most
poverty-stricken urban and rural areas. The bill is sponsored
by Representatives J.C. Watts (OK) and James Talent (MO). It will
use tax incentives, regulatory relief, innovative school reform
pilot projects and homeownership incentives for areas of high
rates of poverty, crime, welfare dependency, joblessness, and
poor schools. Olson and Rector argue that the bill will achieve:
increased job creation; small business expansion and formation;
moral renewal; expanded educational opportunities; greater private
philanthropy to aid the poor; and greater participation by religious
organizations in providing services to the poor. This bill gives
Congress and the Administration an opportunity to change the way
the federal government has been involved in community development
over the last 30 years. The bill realizes that what our nation's
poorest communities need more than larger benefits checks from
the government is economic conditions that enable depressed communities
to become more profitable places for work and businesses. Olson
and Rector conclude that this bill represents an excellent opportunity
to make a bipartisan stand for children by tackling the root causes
of poverty, crime, and illegitimacy. 18 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain,

<br>by Pat Fagan and Wade Horn
<P>
<I>Issue Bulletin</I>, No. 227, The Heritage Foundation<HR>

<P>
Pat Fagan, William H. G. FitzGerald Fellow in Family and Cultural
Studies at The Heritage Foundation, and Wade Horn, Director of
The National Fatherhood Initiative, illustrate how Congress can
protect the rights of parents to raise their children. They argue
that the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act, introduced
by Senator Charles Grassley (IA) and Representative Steve Largent
(OK), will give parents superior standing over government and
its agencies in their children's education and in the protection
and formation of their children's moral character. Fagan and Horn
point out that the bill will declare that parents' rights to direct
the upbringing of their children are fundamental rights which
government can curtail only under conditions of &quot;compelling
interest&quot; and under &quot;strict guidelines&quot; of judicial
procedure, legal terms which guide courts in their decisions.
Overall, they say, the rights of parents as a group are disregarded
or endangered in too many cases by government officials. According
to Fagan and Horn, because of the persistent danger to the fundamental
rights of parents from state court rulings, professional associations,
government bureaucracies, the educational establishment, and international
agencies and bodies, parental rights need codification into law.

John Walters, President of the New Citizenship Project, and James
O'Gara, Director of Research for the New Citizenship Project,
call for President Clinton to exercise leadership in the war on
drugs. They report that he has a poor record in this area. Interdiction
efforts and prosecution for illegal drugs are down, illegal drug
usage and emergency room admissions are up. Walters and O'Gara
argue that part of the problem has been not appointing effective
leaders in key positions to articulate and enforce a strong antidrug
message, and inappropriate reductions in staff at agencies dedicated
to fighting drugs on the front lines. They call on Congress to
focus federal efforts on law enforcement and programs that work,
and fund only those rehabilitation programs that have a track
record of success. One way to do this is to allow funding for
drug counseling and rehabilitation programs provided by religious
organizations. Walters and O'Gara conclude that American taxpayers
deserve presidential leadership on this issue, and the complexity
of the issue is not an excuse for ineffective policy and lack
of serious effort. 15 pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage

Edward Lazear, Hoover Senior Fellow, discusses how the culture
wars in America threaten our ability to absorb new immigrants,
and to benefit from the diversity already present in the United
States. He argues that much of the conflict of the culture wars
in America is generated by government policies that reduce the
incentives to become assimilated and emphasize the differences
in the population. Some examples that Lazear lists are: education
in one's native language; unbalanced immigration policies that
result in large and stable ghettos, welfare availability; and
encouragement of a multilingual society by allowing citizens to
vote in languages other than English. Lazear explores patterns
of cultural assimilation and makes recommendations on policy related
to immigration, education, and language that may lead to an end
of the culture wars. 32 pp. CONTACT: Hoover Institution Press,

<B>Federal Drug War Ignoring Great Ally: Faith-Based Treatment,
</B><br>
by Robert Maginnis
<P>
<I>Insight</I>, Family Research Council<HR>

<P>
Robert Maginnis, Senior Policy Analyst at the Family Research
Council, illustrates how the government is actively discouraging
some of the most effective programs from drug treatment. Faith-based
drug treatment programs have consistently produced the highest
&quot;cure&quot; rates in the country for treating drug abusers.
State and federal agencies have tried to shut down several faith
based drug treatment centers because their practitioners did not
have proper medical qualifications This is despite the fact that
faith-based treatment has had much higher success rates at a fraction
of the cost of government endorsed centers. Maginnis says that
there are two differing schools of thought on the root causes
of drug addiction. Government agencies mostly believe that it
is a disease and should be treated as such. Faith based treatment
sees addiction as beginning with a moral problem and that treatment
requires an acceptance of moral absolutes. Maginnis says that
as far as drug treatment goes, one size does not fit all. Therefore
a diversity of treatment alternatives, including low cost taxpayer-free
and faith based programs must be available. The government should
not try to fight the drug war alone when the local faith community
can play a vital role in prevention and treatment. 12 pp. CONTACT:

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>CENTER FOR INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS</FONT></B>
<HR>
<P>
<B>Violence Against Women Act Declared Unconstitutional</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>CIR won a victory on July 26, 1996, when U.S. District
Judge Jackson L. Diser ruled that the Violence Against Women Act
(&quot;VAWA&quot;), was an impermissible exercise of Congressional
authority under the Commerce Clause and the Enforcement Clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment. In<I> Brzonkala v. Virginia Polytechnic
and State University</I>, CIR represents Antonio Morrison, a Virginia
Tech football player, who was sued, along with two teammates and
the University itself, by a female who formerly attended the school.
The July 26th Order granted CIR's Motion to Dismiss the case based
on VAWA's unconstitutionality.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>At issue in the <I>Brzonkala</I> litigation was the
section of VAWA providing a federal tort remedy for crimes of
violence motivated by an animus toward the victim's gender. Although
the Department of Justice and the National Organization for Women
argued that VAWA was constitutional because of (i) the enormous
impact gender-based crimes have on the national economy and interstate
commerce and (ii) Congress's power to enforce the Equal Protection
Clause, the court disagreed. Judge Kiser ruled that the Supreme
Court's recent decision in <I>Lopez v. United States</I>, striking
down the Gun-Free School Zones Act as beyond Congress's Commerce
Clause power, undermined the arguments of DOJ and NOW. Finding
extensive similarities and few distinctions between the School
Zones Act and VAWA, Judge Kiser held that the latter was also
unconstitutional.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>As for the Enforcement Clause claim,  Judge Kiser
points out, VAWA attempts to compensate women who are victims
of violent acts because of their gender, not because of the states'
denial of their Equal Protection.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>CIR to Represent School Board in Supreme Court</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>CIR, along with Michael Carvin of Shaw, Pittman,
Potts and Trowbridge, represents the Bossier Parish School Board
in <I>Reno v. Bossier Parish School Board</I>, a Voting Rights
Act case which should be argued during the Supreme Court's fall
1996 term. This is expected to test a question left unanswered
by the Court in its major Voting Rights decisions of last term:
whether a local government may be forced to create racially gerrymandered
districts.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Bossier Parish is a rural district of northern Louisiana,
with a minority population of about twenty percent. Because of
the highly scattered nature of the minority population, every
voting subdivision in the parish currently has a white majority.
This has not prevented African-Americans from winning local elective
offices in the past.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In 1993, the Bossier Parish School Board unanimously
accepted a new voting map with twelve districts, all of which
had white majorities. The district lines were based upon nonracial
considerations; an identical plan had already been approved for
use in other elections. Nonetheless, the Justice Department refused
to dilute minority voting strength. This refusal was based in
part on the development by the NAACP of an alternate map, which
would include two oddly-shaped (but majority-minority) districts.
The Justice Department has taken the position that the Voting
Rights Act requires a system of race-based proportional representation,
or, alternately, that the failure to embrace a gerrymandered map
is proof of racist intent.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Professor Sues Bowling Green State University
for Sex and Race Discrimination</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In <I>Hartman v. Trustees of Bowling Green State
University</I>, CIR is representing Dr. John Hartman, a white
male professor, who has sued Bowling Green and the Accrediting
Council on Education in Journalism and Mass Communications for
discrimination against him based on his race and sex. The Complaint
was filed July 1, 1996 in Federal District Court in Ohio.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In 1994, in response to an advertisement, Dr. Hartman,
a tenured professor of Mass Communications at Central Michigan
University, applied for a faculty position that would involve
teaching a class on diversity in media at Bowling Green. Despite
Dr. Hartman's excellent credentials, Bowling Green hired a less
experienced black female without a Ph.D. This hiring decision
came on the heels of the Accrediting Council's withdrawal of full
accreditation from the Bowling Green School of Journalism because
the percentages of women and minorities on its faculty were less
than those in the general population.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Ohio Civil Rights Commission previously concluded
that there was probable cause to believe that Bowling Green discriminated
against Dr. Hartman in this matter.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Columbia Union College Sues Maryland Officials
for Religious Discrimination</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In June CIR, along with Co-Counsel R. Hewitt Pate,
Sarah C. Johnson and Mark B. Bierbower of Hunton &amp; Williams,
filed a complaint on behalf of Columbia Union College in Federal
District Court in Maryland. The Complaint alleges First and Fourteenth
Amendment violations, and violations of the Religious Freedom
Restoration Act.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Columbia Union is a private college affiliated with
the Seventh-day Adventist Church that applied for funds from the
State of Maryland through the Father Sellinger Program. The Maryland
Higher Education Commission denied the fund request stating that
Columbia Union was &quot;pervasively sectarian.&quot; The Commission
has granted funds to Catholic schools such as Mount St. Mary's
and Loyola University, schools which, although &quot;sectarian,&quot;
are apparently not pervasively so. Columbia Union met all the
other requirements necessary to participate in the program and
asserts that the denial of funding by the Commission constitutes
discrimination on the basis of its religious beliefs and speech.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>CIR wins reversal in Fourth Circuit in <BR>
<I><B>Smith v. VCU</B></I></FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In <I>Smith, et al v. Virginia Commonwealth University</I>,
CIR is representing five male professors at VCU who claimed sex
discrimination when the school gave an en masse raise to female
professors in 1992. On May 10, 1996 an <I>en banc</I> panel of
the Fourth Circuit issued a decision reversing a district court's
grant of summary judgment for the University. The opinion of the
court obtained the support of six judges with three judges concurring
and five dissenting.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The <I>en banc</I> decision rejected VCU's attempt
to justify the raises with a regression analysis showing pay disparity
between the genders. The court said that there was an issue of
material fact whether some of the factors excluded from VCU's
study-like performance, productivity and merit-skewed the results
and permitted a false finding of &quot;gender disparity.&quot;

<HR>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>High Court to Decide Who Can Sue Under ESA</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments on November
13, 1996 in <I>Bennett v. Spears</I>, to determine whether a property
owner may assert an injury to an economic interest or constitutionally
protected property right under the citizens suit provision of
the Endangered Species Act (ESA).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Petitioners are two individual ranchers and two irrigation
districts in southern Oregon who rely on water from a series of
federally-operated reservoirs known as the Klamath Project. The
U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service
determined that a minimum level of water needed to be maintained
in the reservoirs to preserve endangered fish species that inhabit
the reservoirs. However, maintaining this water level threatened
Petitioners' beneficial and productive use of their property by
making the supply of irrigation water irregular.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Petitioners filed a &quot;citizen's suit&quot; under
Section 11(g)(1) of the ESA, challenging the decision on the ground
that the government failed to consider economic factors in making
the decision. The federal district court dismissed the suit, and
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed, holding
that the petitioners' economic interest did not fall within the
&quot;zone of interests&quot; protected by the ESA.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Defenders has argued that Congress specifically included
economic factors among those to be considered in making decisions
under the ESA. Furthermore, protecting private property rights
and economic interests is an integral part of species conservation.
Therefore, economic interests are within the &quot;zone of interest&quot;
protected by the ESA and petitioners should have standing to bring
a citizen's suit to protect those interests.<BR>

<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Federal Pressure on Local School Board Violates
Constitution</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In <I>Sakaria &amp; Hillman v. Dare County (North
Carolina) Board of Education</I>, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
orchestrated the condemnation of private beachfront property for
wetland mitigation, by backing a county school board into a corner
over a required wetland permit. The owners of the property that
is being condemned are now petitioning the United States Supreme
Court to review their case.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Petitioners Elpis Sakaria and Mr. and Mrs. Hillman
each purchased a residential beachfront lot on Cape Hatteras Island,
North Carolina, to build a retirement home. Adjacent to the lots
is the local school. In 1988 the School Board needed to expand
the school's athletic field, to qualify the school for accreditation.
The Board owned 12.5 acres next door, enough for the expansion.
However, the Army Corps delineated 3 acres &quot;wetland,&quot;
and arbitrarily required the Board to create 1.84 acres of wetland
for each acre of wetland used to expand the field.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>From 1988 to 1992, the Army Corps rejected 41 sites
suggested for mitigation. With time growing short to obtain accreditation,
the Board &quot;negotiated&quot; an outcome with the Corps: the
Corps would grant a permit if the application included creating
a .5-acre wetland on the Sakaria and Hillman properties. The Board
filed the permit application, and immediately began to condemn
the private property. The property owners challenged the validity
of the condemnation of their property on Fifth and Tenth Amendment
grounds, but so far have been unsuccessful in court.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Defenders will file a brief <I>amici curaie</I> supporting
a Petition for Writ of Certiorari before the United States Supreme
Court arguing that 1) coercion by the Army Corps of the county
school board to carry out a federal objective at the local level
violates the Tenth Amendment and 2) a state agency violates the
Fifth Amendment when it uses its power of eminent domain to accomplish
a federal purpose unrelated to its narrow grant of eminent domain
authority.<BR>

<B>Hog-Wild Regulators Jeopardize Family Farm</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Warren family has been raising hogs in Chesapeake,
Virginia for three generations. But Earl Warren's livelihood is
now at risk because of a new city ordinance enacted specifically
to regulate him out of business.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>For over sixty years, the Warrens have operated a
traditional feed-lot hog farm. Over time, urban expansion has
moved into rural areas and now surrounds their farm. The Warrens,
however, have been able to adapt up until now by simply down-sizing
their operation.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Recently, the city has grown more aggressive in its
effort to make Chesapeake hog-fee, and adopted a new swine control
ordinance in April of 1992. Despite Mr. Warren's good faith attempts
to conform his hog-farming practices to the ordinance, many of
its mandates are arbitrary and have nothing to do with public
health and safety-making full compliance impossible. Indeed, the
farm has continued to comply with applicable environmental standards.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>If Mr. Warren does not fully comply, however, he
faces being shut down as a &quot;public nuisance.&quot; This flies
in the face of the U.S. Supreme Court's admonition in <I>Lucas
v. South Carolina Coastal Council</I> that a legislature cannot
simply decree a historically lawful use of property a &quot;nuisance&quot;
without compensation being paid to the owner. In a lawsuit filed
against Mr. Warren on March 30, 1995, the city has openly stated
in court that its goal is to permanently close down the farm.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Even though the city is suing Mr. Warren, it has
not yet met its own burden of demonstrating that the farm is a
nuisance according to Virginia common law. Defenders' attorney
Barry C. Hodge is defending Mr. Warren in Circuit Court in Chesapeake.
A trial was held on September 8, 1995, but the court has stayed
its decision to hear further evidence as to the feasibility of
complying with the ordinance.<BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>In 1950, a right-of-way was sold to the gas company
across what is now the Drain's property to install an eight-inch
gas pipeline. The agreement did not specify the width of the right-of-way,
therefore full use was made of the property over the years. A
shed was built six inches from the line in 1962, and the Drains
installed their modular home seven and a half feet from it in
1992.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In April of 1993, however, Columbia Gas informed
the drains that their buildings encroached on the company's newly
claimed fifty-foot right-of-way, and later sued the Drains to
force them to move the buildings. According to Columbia, the Drains
cannot put any structures-including fences and trees-within twenty-five
feet of either side of the pipeline. The new easement affects
one-third of their property.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Columbia Gas bases its authority of federal pipeline
safety standards. Columbia asserts that these regulations allow
it to claim a fifty-foot right of way without having to purchase
the Drains' property through eminent domain. Federal regulation,
however, does not require a gas company to maintain a fifty-foot
right-of-way. Another inconsistency is that many other property
owners have buildings within the claimed easement boundaries who
have not been force to move them under pressure from the gas company.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>With Defenders serving as co-counsel, the Drains
filed a counterclaim alleging Columbia Gas's action was an unconstitutional
taking of their private property. After a three-day non-jury trial,

Rights Violation</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Petitioner, Mrs. Evelyn Smith, earns a living by
renting four townhouses she owns in Chico, California. Due to
her religious beliefs, she refused to rent a townhouse to an unmarried
heterosexual couple. The couple complained to the California Fair
Employment and Housing Commission, which found Mrs. Smith guilty
of unlawful &quot;marital status discrimination&quot; under state
law and prohibited Mrs. Smith from excluding heterosexual unmarried
couples from her property, even though &quot;heterosexual couples&quot;
is not a constitutionally protected class. The California Supreme
Court affirmed the decision, stating that Mrs. Smith could have
avoided the conflict &quot;by selling her units and redeploying
the capital in other investments.&quot; Mrs. Smith has petitioned
the United States Supreme Court to review the decision, on the
basis that the California law violates her First Amendment right
to religious free exercise and her Fifth Amendment property rights.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Defenders presented the Fifth Amendment argument
in its brief to the Court supporting Mrs. Smith's petition for
review, that the California law violates Fifth Amendment rights.
Specifically, the law deprives Mrs. Smith of her right to exclude
others, which is among the property rights protected by the Fifth
Amendment Just Compensation Clause, and which has been identified
by the United States Supreme Court as one of the most fundamental
aspects of property ownership.<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>Challenge to Large-Lot Zoning on Chappaquiddick</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court will hear
a challenge to a local zoning by-law that imposes a three-acre
minimum to build on residential lots on Chappaquiddick. The purported
public interest underlying the three-acre minimum was environmental
protection.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Petitioner Herring Creek Farm owns 215 acres of residential
property on the Island and had planned to develop it with homes
on one-acre lots for low- to moderate-income families. At trial,
Herring Creek showed that the three acre minimum did not advance
the stated environmental goals and further that the large lot
sizes makes home ownership nearly impossible for middle- and lower-income
families. The trial court upheld the by-law. This appeal to the
highest court in the state followed directly from that decision,
bypassing the intermediate appeals court due to the interest in
the high court in establishing statewide guidance on this issue.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Defenders argued as <I>amicus curiae</I> supporting
Herring Creed that the zoning restriction is constitutionally
invalid because it fails to &quot;substantially advance&quot;
the government interest in protecting the environment. The United
States Supreme Court has held that a law that derogates from private
property rights is invalid if the law does not substantially advance
the goal sought to be achieved by the law. Oral argument is currently
scheduled before the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court.<BR>

<B>Indians Claim Right to Harvest Shellfish on Private Property</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Years before Washington became a state, the United
States purchased by treaty from 16 Northwest Indian Tribes the
right to use the beach and surrounding upland in Puget Sound.
Under the treaties, the Tribes retained their right to take &quot;fish&quot;
from all customary locations not staked off or occupied by settlers.
The State of Washington later took title to the tidelands and
sold them to private citizens. These private landowners have &quot;seeded&quot;
the tidelands to create new shellfish beds, and have harvested
the shellfish, enjoying exclusive use and quiet enjoyment of the
tidelands for over a century.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Now the United States-on behalf of the Tribes-is
suing the State of Washington, claiming that the Tribes' right
to &quot;fish&quot; includes the right to harvest shellfish even
on privately owned tidelands. The United States has offered no
payment of just compensation for its destruction of these private
property rights on behalf of the Indian Tribes. The outcome of
this case between the federal and state governments will affect
200,000 private property owners. The federal district court decided
the case in favor of the Tribes. The case is now before the United
States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Defenders filed a brief <I>amicus curiae</I> in the
Ninth Circuit on behalf of 65,000 members of the Upland Property
Owners of Washington (UPOW), which has intervened in the lawsuit.
Defenders advanced three property rights arguments. First, the
United States' claim to fishing rights for the Tribes constitutes
a physical invasion of private property and second, destroys the
private owners' investment-backed expectations in the tidelands.
Third, Defenders argued that the government's position in this
case violates the Equal Footing Doctrine, which requires that
any state admitted to the Union must be granted all rights and
privileges given to the original thirteen states.<BR>

<B>Milwaukee School Choice Action</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>As expected, Wisconsin Circuit Court Judge Paul Higginbotham
in August refused to lift an injunction preventing Milwaukee school
children from attending religious schools in the choice program,
and ruled that the program violates the religion clause of the
Wisconsin Constitution. However, the judge dissolved the remainder
of the injunction, meaning that at least 300 more youngsters will
be able to attend nonsectarian schools this year.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The ruling followed four hours of testimony and three
hours of oral argument. Former Milwaukee Public Schools superintendent
Howard Fuller led off with testimony on why the choice program
is essential not only to expand opportunities for minority and
economically disadvantaged kids, but to foment needed reform in
the public schools.  Zakiya Courtney testified on the real-world
effects of the program and the injunction. Two parents, Pilar
Gonzalez and Val Johnson-representing hundreds of others-offered
personal perspectives on what private schools have meant for their
children and economic burdens the families face in keeping them
there. Harvard professor Paul Peterson testified on his recent
study finding substantial academic gains among choice students.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Unfortunately, it was clear that Judge Higginbotham,
though moved by IJ's witnesses' testimony, found the religious
school aspect of the program untenable. He concluded that the
Wisconsin Constitution is more prohibitive than the First Amendment,
and that the program's &quot;primary effect&quot; is to advance
religion.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>But Judge Higginbotham was not persuaded that the
plaintiffs showed a reasonable likelihood of prevailing on their
other state constitutional claims, so he lifted the rest of the
injunction on the enrollment caps. That means the number of eligible
students increases from 1,500 to 15,000; and that schools may
enroll up to 100 percent of their students from the choice program
(up from 65 percent.) Last year, about 1,500 choice students were
enrolled in nonsectarian schools in the choice program. This year,
about 1,900 applied to nonsectarian schools. They now will be
able to attend, which also somewhat relieves the pressure on the
PAVE program to provide scholarships.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>On the litigation front, IJ will attempt to extricate
the religion issues from the remainder of the case and seek an
immediate appeal of that portion of the judge's ruling. The non-religion
issues are schedule for three rounds of briefs and argument before
Judge Higginbotham over the next three months. Also, on the eve
of the hearing, the NAACP filed a lawsuit claiming the expanded
program promotes racial segregation. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Religious School Choice in Vermont</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The IJ will file a lawsuit this week against the State of Vermont
on behalf of the Chittenden school board. The board voted to include
religious high schools among those available to students at public
expense. (Vermont towns that have no public  high schools pay
tuition for students at neighboring public high schools or private
schools.) Contending that tuition payment at religious schools
chosen by parents violates the First Amendment, the state has
cut off all education funds to the town, even though the portion
that would be allocated for religious high school tuition constitutes
only two percent of the town's education funding.</FONT><BR>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The IJ will seek a preliminary injunction in state
court, arguing that (1) including religious schools among the
options does not violate the First Amendment, (2) exclusion of
religious schools violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act,
and (3) the cutoff of state funds exceeds the state's authority.

<B>Landmark Legal Foundation Blasts Senate Ethics Committee</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Landmark Legal Foundation, co-counsel to former RTC
criminal investigator L. Jean Lewis, who last year testified before
the Senate Special Committee investigating Whitewater, blasted
the Senate Ethics Committee for its failure to sanction Maryland
Senator Paul Sarbanes and the Whitewater Committee's minority
chief counsel, Richard Ben-Veniste, for their use of a private
letter written by Lewis, which was &quot;undeleted&quot; from
a computer diskette.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;The Ethics Committee completely abdicated its
responsibility to Ms. Lewis and to all Americans. Senators and
Senate staffers are not above the law,&quot; said Landmark President
Mark R. Levin, who filed the ethics complaint on Lewis's behalf
last December. &quot;They are not free to behave as rogue federal
police violating the privacy rights of witnesses appearing before
Congress. Nor are they free to take a witness's personal property,
which they did in this case.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Lewis's 22-page personal letter, which was unrelated
to Lewis's work in investigating Madison Guaranty Savings and
Loan and the Whitewater Development Corporation, was apparently
retrieved by computer technicians from a computer diskette Lewis
produced in response to the Senate Whitewater Committee's subpoena
for information relevant to her investigative work. Since her
letter was not subject to the Whitewater Committee's subpoena
as it fell outside its subject matter and time frame, when Senator
Sarbanes and Ben-Veniste retrieved it from the diskette they violated
Ms. Lewis's Fourth Amendment privacy rights.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;Astonishingly, the Ethics Committee did not
talk with Ms. Lewis or her counsel at any time during the nine
months following the filing of the complaint, though it apparently
interviewed Senator Sarbanes and Ben-Veniste to return to Ms.
Lewis her personal property; and, it offered no explanation or
justification for its summary dismissal of our complaint,&quot;
declared Levin. &quot;When the Constitution can be so easily trampled,
when an individual's rights can be so easily ignored, and when
Ethics Committee members close their eyes to these abuses, there
is something terribly wrong in the U.S. Senate.&quot;<BR>

Whether Students' Rights to Free Speech Includes Giving Religious
Messages At Graduation Ceremonies</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>On August 14, 1996, the Eleventh Circuit Court of
Appeals reheard oral arguments in the case of <I>Adler v. Duval
County School Board</I>. This case is on appeal from a decision
of a federal district court in Florida which held that a school
board policy permitting students to determine what type of graduation
message they would give does not violate the Constitution, even
if that message includes religious speech. Arguments were presented
to the Eleventh Circuit in March 1995 on this case. The court
did not hand down a decision, but instead has asked to hear further
argument.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The case began in May 1993 by challenging a school
board policy allowing the graduating senior class to elect to
have two minutes of uncensored speech to open or close the graduation
ceremonies. If the students chose to utilize the two minutes,
they would then elect a fellow student to address the class. The
content of the message was to be determined by the student addressing
the class and was not to be censored by the school. The school
policy allowed students to give any type of message, from poetic
speech to religious speech. During the 1993 graduation ceremonies
of the 17 schools in Duval County, 6 senior classes chose either
no message or a secular message, while the remaining 11 chose
a religious message.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The ACLU brought suit on behalf of 3 students against
the Duval County School Board arguing that this policy allowed
religious messages or prayer and thus violated the First Amendment.
Liberty Counsel, a religious civil liberties legal defense organization,
intervened on behalf of 11 students to defend the school policy,
arguing that the free speech rights of students was at stake.
If the school board were to lose the case, the students' free
speech rights would be taken away.<BR>

Idaho have just as much right to sue regarding violations of federal
environmental statutes as do organized environmental groups says
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. In a decision
reversing a federal district court ruling, the appeals court held
that rural residents of the timber producing area have legal standing
regarding environmental issues despite the fact that their primary
concern is economic. In addition, the court held that statutes
governing the management of national forests are dedicated to
timber harvesting activities and that the local resident may sue
to challenge U.S. Forest Service decisions reducing allowable
timber harvests.<BR>

<B>MSLF Help Stops U.S. Forest Service</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A property owner in northern California says the
willingness of MSLF to provide her legal assistance brought an
almost immediate concession from the U.S. Forest Service (USFS),
even before MSLF filed a single document. For years, the USFS
had used the property of Kate Novoa without permission. Yet when
she objected, the USFS asserted that it had an easement over her
land. Remarkably, the USFS never produced documented proof of
its alleged easement. When Ms. Novoa advised USFS officials that
MSLF was willing to provide her legal assistance, the USFS suddenly
discovered that it had no easement over her land and agreed to
end its use of her property.<BR>

<B>Forest Service Ignores Facts - Locks Out Miners</B>

doing, they have ignored the fact that the proposed area does
not meet the requirements of federal regulation that the area
be &quot;virgin&quot; and &quot;unmodified&quot; by act of man.
In addition, the area contains numerous mining claims of which
the federal government is well aware. Remarkably, none of the
federal documents supporting the creation of the Hoosier Ridge
NRA addresses the fact that the are is neither &quot;virgin&quot;
nor &quot;unmodified&quot; or the fact that mining claims are
present. As a result, MSLF filed a lawsuit on behalf of the Park

Board of Land Appeals (IBLA) has ruled that self defense may not

a grizzly bear when confronted in his own yard, was convicted
of a violation of the ESA despite his plea of self defense. An
Administrative Law Judge ruled that although Shuler reasonably
feared for his life (the necessary precedent for the use of deadly
force), he could not claim self-defense since he was at fault
for introducing himself into &quot;the zone of imminent danger.&quot;
The IBLA upheld that remarkable ruling, declaring that since Shuler
knew a grizzly bear was outside, he should not have left his house.
Since the IBLA's ruling conflicts with the law on self-defense
(a homeowner may confront an armed intruder on his own property),
MSLF will file a lawsuit in federal court.</FONT>

plan hit a roadblock in Vermont's Act 250. A jurisdictional opinion

to adopt its subdivision rules. That let the state-wide Board
assert authority over the project.<BR>

while they were on strike. The case involves a labor dispute at
Yankee Gas. The company offered a raise but announced a plan to
later change medical benefits. The union did not immediately strike,
but refused to commit to staying on the job during negotiations.
Realizing that would leave its operations at the union's mercy,
Yankee put its offer into effect. The union promptly struck and
its members filed for unemployment benefits.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The state ordered benefits paid to the workers because
it felt portions of Yankee's offer were inferior to the prior
contract. Yankee appealed. NELF's <I>amicus</I> brief with the
Superior Court, in the name of the Connecticut Business and Industry
Association argued that the refusal to commit to staying on the
job prevented the union from claiming a lockout. The judge agreed
and reversed the order to pay unemployment benefits. He also noted
that the state should have reviewed the final offer to see if,
viewed as a package, it was inferior to the expired contract.

<B>NELF Helps Win Spink Case</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In a case hailed by the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>
as &quot;an important victory for employers,&quot; the U.S. Supreme
Court has ruled that a company may require workers to waive their
right to sue for age discrimination as a condition for receiving
special early retirement benefits.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The decision in <I>Spink v. Lockheed Corp.</I> overruled
a lower court which had allowed the worker to sue Lockheed as
a fiduciary under ERISA, the federal pension law.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>NELF in its own name filed an <I>amicus </I>brief
with the Court, which argued that the fiduciary standard should
not and could not apply to a company's dealings with its own employees.
Use of that standard would require companies to put employees'
interests above shareholders, in violation of corporate law. The
Court's decision eliminates that risk and restores management's
flexibility in obtaining voluntary employment reductions.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>NELF Enters Class Action Fray</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>NELF has joined with Lawyers for Civil Justice, a
Washington-based public interest group asking the U.S. Court of
Appeals in Philadelphia to reconsider a decision which overturned
a settlement of a millions of prospective asbestos-related cases.
In this, <I>Georgine v. Amchem</I>, the District Court used a
Rule 23 class action to approve a single settlement in one &quot;case&quot;
which disposed of millions of individual cases. Notwithstanding
the proposed settlement, the Court of Appeals reviewed the class
action settlement to see if the underlying &quot;case&quot; could
have met requirements of Rule 23. Because it did not, the court
vacated the settlement.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Unless reversed, the consequences of this decision
on business and the judicial system will be dramatic and negative.
Instead of one comprehensive and fair settlement that resolves
the issue and caps businesses' exposure, there will be years of
litigation with inconsistent judgments, enormous legal expenses
and a lack of predictability. The upshot will be that, while some
plantiffs may get more money, many will get less, far more money
will be spent on legal fees and kept by plaintiffs' lawyers, and
courts will be crowded with hundreds of thousands of complex,
repetitious cases.<BR>

<B>NELF Help Bring Massachusetts Tax Law Into the 21 Century</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Massachusetts' Supreme Judicial Court has acknowledged
the &quot;assistance&quot; received from an <I>amicus</I> brief
prepared by NELF in a tax case which tested whether the state's
tax coded can be adapted to modern manufacturing techniques. The
case, <I>Houghton-Mifflin Co. v. Commissioners of Revenue</I>,
involved whether a major publisher, which had subcontracted a
number of physical tasks like binding while continuing to perform
high technology work like organizing texts and designing CD/ROMS,
was entitled to retain its manufacturing status. Manufacturing
status provides a business with significant tax incentives to
increase investment and employment.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>NELF's brief, filed on behalf of Associated Industries
of Massachusetts, argued that continuation of the exemption in
this case was reasonable application of the 1930's-era law to
today's changed conditions.<BR>

<B>Court Allows Second Bite at the Apple</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>California Assemblyman Tom Bates (D-Berkeley) is
fighting tooth and nail to get a &quot;second bite at the apple.&quot;
He and a handful of his supporters have filed suit in federal
court trying yet again to strike down term limits. Furthermore,
Bates' bid to undo the state term limits is being given a sympathetic
ear by a federal trial court that is disregarding PLF's precedent-setting
victory in <I>Legislature v. Eu</I> and is heading down its own
path requiring the validity of Proposition 140 to be litigated
through the court system all over again!<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The court has refused to dismiss the lawsuit and
has given Mr. Bates great latitude to make up arguments for keeping
his suit alive. For instance, the Berkeley lawmaker has argued
that since he was not individually named as a party to the first
Proposition 140 lawsuit, he was not bound by it. Well, Mr. Bates
may not have been named in that prior suit, but an investigation
of documents filed with the Fair Practices Commission revealed
that he helped underwrite it.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Public records show that Mr. Bates spent $12,000
trying to defeat Proposition 140 at the ballot box, and when that
failed, he paid another $1,000 directly to the law firm that represented
the Legislature in the California Supreme Court for the purpose
of supporting the first challenge to state term limits. In addition,
a subpoena of that law firm's billing records revealed that not
only did Tom Bates help finance <I>Legislature v. Eu</I> litigation,
but 39 of his colleagues who were not parties to that case also
contributed to the lawsuit- to the tune of $229,000! With this
information  in hand, PLF went back to federal court demanding
again that Mr. Bates be bound by the first lawsuit and that his
suit be dismissed.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In spite of Mr. Bates' obvious involvement in the
prior case, the federal court decided that he could start the
case all over again in her court because in her opinion his contribution
was too small a sum to buy him &quot;control&quot; over the prior
lawsuit. The court would not accept that 58 legislators challenged
Proposition 140 in 1991 by either lending their names to the complaint
or by opening their pocketbooks, with nonparty legislators underwriting
 half the lawsuit. Instead the court has permitted the lawmaker's
lawyers to recruit two Democratic Assemblywomen, Barbara Friedman
and Martha Escutia, as additional plaintiffs in the lawsuit.

<B>Voting Districts Drawn by Race Rules Unconstitutional</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In another victory for equal protection, the United
States Supreme Court held on June 13, that election districts
in Texas and North Carolina that were drawn along racial boundaries
are unconstitutional. PLF argued in both cases that race is an
inappropriate criteria for drawing lines for congressional districts
and that the interests of all Americans are ill-served by political
boundaries that isolate minority voters in so-called &quot;majority-minority&quot;
districts.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Texas' 18th, 29th, 30th and North Carolina's 12th
congressional districts were oddly configured and bizarre in their
geographic configurations. There was nothing compact or contiguous
about the districts in question which were drawn for the sole
purpose of assuring the election of black representatives, while
completely disregarding traditional districting principles. In
both cases, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed with the arguments made
by PLF which has long advocated individual rights over group rights
and the necessity for government to act in a color-blind manner,
both in the context of &quot;affirmative action&quot; programs
and in the context of the Voting Rights Act. The Supreme Court
also rebuffed the Department of Justice's continuing attempts
to coerce states into a &quot;max-black&quot; scheme of maximizing
the number of minority districts, even when there is no compelling
reason to do so.<BR>

<B>Fate of Santa Monica Rent Control Before State Supreme Court</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Under the pretext of &quot;helping the poor and the
elderly&quot; the Santa Monica rent control bureaucrats have been
taking rental property owners to the cleaners while expanding
the scope of regulation and control of rental properties throughout
the city. And yet, despite the economic and social harms it causes,
rent control remains a source of long-term security and prosperity
for the bureaucrats and huge administrative staffs need to keep
the program operating.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Using 1980-1990 census data from Berkeley, Santa
Monica, and Cotati, a California Apartment Association-PLF Rent
Control Project study reveals the damaging impact rent control
has on housing and people-particularly the poor, minorities and
the elderly. The study proves the bureaucrats wrong, rent control
does not accomplish what was originally intended, and this is
evidence that cannot be ignored.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The CAA-PLF Rent Control Project fired its first
salvo in the war against rent control on March 16, 1994, against
the City of Santa Monica. That suit charged, among other things,
that Santa Monica's rent control ordinance effects an uncompensated
taking of private property in violation of the U.S. Constitution.
In addition to showing that the rent regulations fail to advance
any legitimate governmental interest (and therefore are unconstitutional),
the suit challenges the local rent board's bizarre accounting
practices and determined whether owners receive a &quot;fair return.&quot;
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A trial court threw out PLF's lawsuit claiming the
rent control board had a &quot;rational basis&quot; for imposing
its restrictions. Under this weak standard, rental property owners
have little hope of successfully challenging such measures as
unconstitutional takings. Fortunately, the California Court of
Appeal overturned that trial court decision in this case, ruling
that courts must not take challenges to rent control too lightly
and instead must examine such cases with a higher level of scrutiny.
In so holding, the court unanimously rejected the idea-urged by
the Rent Control Board and accepted by the trial judge-that courts
must uphold rent ordinances if they can imagine any conceivable
rational basis for enactment.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The court determined that if rental property owners
can prove that a rent control law has denied them economically
viable use of their land or fails to substantially advance a legitimate
government interest, then that law &quot;goes too far.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In so ruling, the Court of Appeal ordered the trial
court to conduct a full trial and hear PLF's damaging evidence.
Greatly disturbed by the prospect of having to defend its rent
control regime and accompanying socialist policies, the city sought
refuge in the California Supreme Court where the case presently
sits.<BR>

<B>SLF Again Mounts Legal Assault on City of Atlanta &quot;Domestic
Partnership&quot; Ordinance</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The city of Atlanta in September enacted a &quot;domestic
partners&quot; ordinance, allowing for non-married<B> </B>partners
of City employees to receive healthcare and other benefits. SLF
filed suit in local superior court challenging the constitutionality
of the ordinance. A similar ordinance was enacted in 1993, and
SLF's lawsuit against the City in that case was successfully decided
by the Georgia Supreme Court. The Court held that the City ordinance
defined specifically both &quot;dependence&quot; and &quot;family&quot;
for purposes of justifying the extension of employee benefits
in a manner which conflicted with the state constitution and statutes
and was therefore unconstitutional and void.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In the present case, the City ordinance similarly
defines &quot;dependent&quot; in a manner which SLF attorneys
contend conflicts with state law. In a press conference held in
Atlanta in September to announce the lawsuit, SLF President Matthew
J. Glavin told the press corps, &quot;Atlanta has once again crossed
the line drawn by the General Assembly and the Georgia Supreme
Court by attempting to recognize relationships not recognized
at the state level. We trust that this lawsuit will once and for
all put an end to the City's illegal efforts.&quot; <BR>

<B>FDA's Dr. Kessler Ordered to Give Deposition</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>WLF scored a major victory in its ongoing litigation
against Dr. David Kessler and the Food and Drug Administration
regarding the FDA's ban on dissemination of vital medical literature
to doctors on the off-label use of FDA approved drugs and devices.
In <I>WLF v. Kessler</I>, the U.S. District Court for the District
of Columbia recently denied Dr. Kessler's attempts to prevent
WLF attorneys from taking his deposition regarding this clearly
unconstitutional FDA policy of censorship, and ordered him to
appear for a two-hour deposition. Justice Department and FDA attorneys,
however, are seeking to appeal that decision.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>WLF Represents Congressmen Seeking to Uphold &quot;3/5 Rule&quot;
on Taxes</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>WLF recently filed a brief in the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the D.C. Circuit in <I>Skaggs v. Carle</I> on behalf of 22
U.S. Senators and Representatives who are defending the constitutionality
of the House's recently adopted &quot;3/5 Rule&quot; on taxes.
The rule, which requires a three-fifths vote rather than a simple
majority to raise taxes, is under attack by several Democrats
in the House and a variety of liberal organizations.  WLF's brief
argues that the plaintiffs claims are not justiciable and the
Constitution imposes no restraints on the House of Representatives'
power to adopt procedural rules.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Supporting Tort Reform for Municipal Governments</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>WLF recently asked the U.S. Supreme Court to throw
out a huge tort award imposed on an Oklahoma county because one
of its deputy sheriffs allegedly used excessive force when pulling
a motorist from her car during a traffic stop following a high-speed
chase. WLF argued in <I>Bryan County v. Brown</I> that while public-sector
employees can be sued under the Civil Rights Act of 1871 if they
violate someone's constitutional rights, a municipality should
not be held liable for the actions of its employees unless those
actions were taken pursuant to some established municipal policy.
WLF urged the Court to reject the lower court's determination
that such a policy can be found to exist based simply on the municipality's
alleged negligence in hiring the deputy sheriff. WLF argued that
plaintiffs should be required to demonstrate that the municipality
repeatedly has made negligent hiring decisions.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>WLF Demands Probe of FDA's Contacts with Plaintiffs' Bar</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>WLF recently demanded that HHSs Inspector General
launch an investigation of meetings between senior FDA officials
and members of the plaintiffs' bar. FDA officials have had repeated
contacts with plaintiffs' lawyers who are pushing FDA to take
action unfavorable to the many pharmaceutical and medical device
companies who are targets of class action lawsuits. WLF recently
determined through a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit that FDA
has been failing to keep written records of all such meetings,
as it is required to do by law. WLF is demanding that the Inspector
General investigate the full extent of the violations by senior
FDA personnel. WLF charges that by attempting to hide their meetings
with plaintiffs' lawyers, FDA officials create the impression
that the agency has become beholden to a politically powerful
interest group, at the expense of the health and safety of the
American people.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>High Court Sides with WLF in First Amendment Challenge to FEC
Rule</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Supreme Court in late June struck down a Federal
Election Commission rule that restricted party committees in making
independent expenditures in connection with congressional elections.
The ruling in <I>Colorado Republican Fed. Campaign Comm. v. FEC</I>
was a victory for WLF, which had represented eight Members of
Congress as well as former Senator Eugene McCarthy in the case.
The High Court accepted WLF's argument that the First Amendment
prohibits restrictions on the type of independent political speech
(i.e., campaign spending not directly controlled by a candidate)
at issue in this case.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Court Once Again Says No to Racial Gerrymandering</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Supreme Court in late June struck down racially
gerrymandered congressional districts in North Carolina and Texas,
holding that the Equal Protection Clause prohibits using race
as the predominant factor in drawing electoral lines. In the Texas
case, <I>Bush v. Vera</I>, WLF had represented Linda Chavez's
Center for Equal Opportunity and several Members of Congress who
opposed dividing the electorate along racial lines. WLF argued
that racial gerrymandering is unnecessary to permit blacks and
Hispanics to compete in elections on an equal footing and promotes
divisiveness between people of different races.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B>Commercial Speech Rights Supported</B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>WLF continued its strong advocacy of commercial speech
when it argued this month in the Maryland Court of Appeals (that
state's highest court) that Maryland may not constitutionally
restrict the right of businesses to advertise going-out-of-business
sales. Maryland imposes strict licensing requirements on all such
advertising and has been attempting to fine a furniture store
that advertised a liquidation sale without first jumping through
all necessary bureaucratic hoops. WLF argues in <I>Jakanna Woodworks,
Inc. v. Montgomery County</I> that the First Amendment bars Maryland
from attempting to suppress advertising that the State does not
claim is false or misleading and that calls attention to activities
that are fully legal (indeed, that are not even subject to regulation
in Maryland).<BR>

</FONT></B></CENTER>
<hr><P>
<font size=3> 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;




	On almost every indicator of child well-being, children today fare worse than their counterparts just a generation ago. The reason: the dramatic rise, over the last thirty years, in the number of children living in fatherless households.  Indeed, children growing up without fathers are more likely to fail at school or to drop out, engage in early sexual activity, develop drug and alcohol problems, and experience or perpetrate violence.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The National Fatherhood Initiative was founded three years ago to counter the growing problem of fatherlessness by stimulating a broad-based social movement to restore responsible fatherhood as a national priority. With the support and involvement of such notable Americans as former U.S. Education Secretary <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William Bennett</a>, actor James Earl Jones, and pollster George Gallup, we developed the following three-part strategy for ensuring that more children grow up with a loving father. <p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

First, we are pursuing an aggressive public education campaign highlighting the importance of fathers to the well-being of children and communities.  In fact, NFI has netted nearly 20,000 media mentions over the past two years. In addition, we have developed, in conjunction with the Ad Council, a national public service announcement (PSA) campaign to raise the awareness of every American that fathers make unique and irreplaceable contributions to the lives of their children, and that collectively we need to support and encourage men to be good and responsible fathers. One of these ads has appeared nearly a half dozen times in <i>USA Today</i>. In partnership with Radio America, we have also developed a series of two dozen radio PSAs featuring such prominent Americans as former HUD Secretary Jack Kemp, Senator Dan Coats, General Colin Powell, Senator Bill Bradley, Congressman and former Seattle Seahawk Steve Largent, and Penn State football coach Joe Paterno.
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Second, we are organizing coalitions of national and local community leaders committed to creating a culture that values and supports good fathers. In October of 1994, we convened the first ever National Summit on Fatherhood in Dallas, Texas, where hundreds of our nation's civic, business, and philanthropic leaders gathered to begin building a national consensus on the need to quickly reduce father absence. We then organized and hosted an interfaith leadership summit on fatherhood in June 1996. This summit attracted dozens of representatives from various faiths who discussed ideas for encouraging, both individually and collectively, engaged fathering.  Additionally, we are partnering with national civic organizations, including United Way of America and Boys and Girls Clubs of America, to stimulate local voluntary efforts toward father-friendly community building.
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
We are also increasingly working with the nation's governors.  For example, NFI was recently awarded a contract by the Virginia  Department of Health to implement a state-wide fatherhood promotion campaign as part of Governor George Allen's citizen empowerment initiative.  As the coordinator of this effort, NFI developed a series of state-specific PSAs, hosted local fatherhood forums throughout the state, and developed a resource center to assist grassroots organizations and individuals to implement local fatherhood promotion efforts.

In addition to our work in Virginia, NFI has been asked to provide consultation and advice to such diverse governors as William Weld of Massachusetts, Roy Romer of Colorado, Pete Wilson of California, and Birch Bayh of Indiana, as each seeks to find ways to promote, rather than discourage, responsible fatherhood through state policy initiatives. To help support our state policy work, NFI recently co-authored a document entitled "Seven Things States Can Do To Promote Responsible Fatherhood." Published by the NGA's Council of Governors' Policy Advisors, this report has been widely disseminated to state and local government officials.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Third, we are taking our pro-fatherhood message directly to individual men.  Through the skill building and community resource materials, we provide information on how men can become better fathers, and how local communities can promote, encourage, and support fathers.  One of our most successful publications, Father Facts, contains national data on trends in fatherhood, as well as research documenting the negative consequences of father absence.  We also publish a resource catalogue containing books, tapes, and other fatherhood products.
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There is substantial evidence that our efforts are beginning to bear fruit. Whether reflected in stadiums filled with Promise Keepers, the streets of our nation's capital inundated with Million Man Marchers, or news stories highlighting the connection between absent fathers and such diverse social ills as crime, educational failure and welfare dependency, fatherhood is in the air. Virtually everyone-from Dan Quayle to Bill Clinton-now agrees: fathers matter, and they matter a lot more than many had previously realized.
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The job, however, is only half done.  Though few still argue seriously that fathers are superfluous, the number of children growing up in father absent households continues to rise.  This year, more than a million children will experience the divorce or separation of their parents. An additional 1.3 million babies will be fathered out of wed-lock. Overall, nearly 2.5 million children will join the ranks of the fatherless.
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Certainly, much has been accomplished.  But we must not delude ourselves into believing that the struggle to renew fatherhood has been won. Far too many children grow up in homes without fathers. The most important battles are still before us.  Achieving attitudinal change may be hard; but behavioral change is even harder.  And that is what our children need most of all.

<b>Neoisolationism and Global Realities,</b> by Murray Weidenbaum<p>
<i>Policy Study</i> No. 130, Center for the Study of American Business<p>
Murray Weidenbaum, Director of the Center for the Study of American Business, argues that the U.S. cannot revert to isolationist policies in the post-Cold War era given the current and strong trends towards globalization. To support his argument, Weidenbaum presents eight major points which illustrate the increasingly strong movement towards globaliliztion. First, he states that existing technology and international competition have already made America part of the global marketplace. Second, he points to the fact that U.S. businesses are increasingly participating in the international economy given the potential high profits and growth rates. Third, he presents the argument that with growing numbers of cross-border alliances, transnational enterprises are becoming more and more common. Then, Weidenbaum argues that the booming economies and little government regulation in some foreign countries, have made it so the rewards of foreign investment far outweight the risks of political instability. The fifth point is the attraction the diversifying of investments internationally holds to businessmen seeking to minimize their vulnerabiltiy to regional recessions. Next he points out that the U.S. can not ignore the rise of China and other Southeastern Asian countries as Economic powerhouses; it must be prepared to compete with them both in the U.S. and Asian markets. Similarly, the continued process of economic unification in Western Europe and the growing strength of Germany, also demands a U.S. presence in the global marketplace. Finally, he argues that given the United States strong economy, too much potential for further growth exists in the international sphere that would be lost should the U.S. choose to follow an isolationist course.  Weidenbaum concludes by asserting that protectionism does not work and that as the twenty-first century approaches, private enterprises, not government, will lead the U.S.'s movements on the global stage. 16pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington Univers

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/natsec/fyi103.html">Flawed Intelligence Report No Guide for Missile Threat</a>, by <a href="/heritage/staff/spring.htm">Baker Spring</a><p>
<i>F.Y.I.</i> No. 103, The Heritage Foundation<p>
In his assessment of the U.S. intelligence community's 1995 report on America's need for a missile defense system, Senior Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation Baker Spring argues that given a host of inconsistencies, the report should not be used by members of Congress to help them determine their votes on the Defend America Act.  The act would commit America to the deployment of a missile defense system by 2003, but the intelligence community's report asserts that the U.S. is under no real threat of a missile attack in the near future.  Spring writes, however, that the authors of the assessment: 1) fail to address the threat posed by long-range missiles in China and Russia; 2) write off Alaska and Hawaii as territory to defend against missile attack; 3) are overly optimistic about how long it will take rogue states to develop long-range missiles; 4) unwisely downplay the potential impact of foreign assistance on the missile threat to America; 5) underestimate the impact of space launch vehicle development on missile proliferation; 6) are completely unrealistic about the potential sale of long-range missiles and space launch vehicles; and 7) inexplicably dismiss the threat of accidental or unauthorized launches against the U.S. Baker concludes by raising questions about the legitimacy of the report, noting that the General Accounting Office has launched an investigation to determine if the Clinton Administration intervened in the production of the report. 4pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/natsec/bg1083.html">Will Clinton Pay the Price for America to Remain a Global Power,</a> by <a href="/heritage/staff/spring.htm">Baker Spring</a><p>
<i>Backgrounder</i> No. 1083, The Heritage Foundation<p>
Baker Spring, Senior Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation, writes that the Clinton Administration is underfunding its own proposed force structure for America's military by approximately $130 billion.  According to Spring, this coming shortfall will leave the United States with two options: 1) increase defense spending to match America's current level of international commitments; or 2) renege or partially withdraw from existing U.S. security commitments.  While opponents of defense spending have argued that with the Cold War over the U.S. no longer needs to have a defense budget three times the size of any other nation (as it currently does), Spring disagrees. He holds that the American military's distance from the areas to which it is committed and must project power, the high technology weaponry it uses in order to limit casualties, and its volunteer rather than conscription troops all demand higher levels of spending.  Spring also argues that reneging on security commitments could open the door to a host of international conflicts that a down-sized U.S. military could not deal with. In order to resolve the funding shortage, Spring calls for a large scale debate in Congress to alert the American people to the problem and ultimately lead the U.S. to be capable of meeting its global security commitments. 11 pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<i>F.Y.I.</i>  No. 104, The Heritage Foundation<p>
Ariel Cohen, Senior Policy Analyst for The Heritage Foundation, outlines a report written by advisors of Communist Party Leader and former Russian presidential candidate Gennady Zyuganov. The authors of the report, proponents of hard-line communist doctrine and advocates of more aggressive military posturing, make a number of suggestions which, if adhered to, could prove profoundly disturbing for the United States. Such possibilities include: 1) Russia adopting a nuclear deterrence posture for perceived non-nuclear threats; 2) maintaining the conception of the U.S. and NATO as Russia's enemies.; 3) reorganizing Russia's military into a series of smaller but highly mobile units; and 4) preparing to reconquer by force the New Independent States of the former Soviet Union. Cohen cautions that regardless of the election's outcome, the views expressed in the report reflect those of many highly placed officials in Russia's government and military and could influence policy in the years to come. 11pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a>

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/trade/asc141.html">Why Renewing MFN for China Serves U.S. Interests,</a> by <a href="/heritage/staff/yates.html">Stephen J. Yates</a><p>
<i>Asian Studies Center Backgrounder</i> No. 141, The Heritage Foundation<p>
Stephen J. Yates, Policy Analyst for the Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center, contends that revoking China's Most Favored Nation trading status would be directly contrary to the United States' interests in Asia.  China's human rights abuses, weapons proliferation, and a host of other problems have prompted many in Congress to call for the denial of MFN to China. But Yates argues that  such a revocation is not in accordance with either the MFN's historical or contemporary purpose. MFN, rather than being the extension of special trading privileges, is more aptly described as the normal trading status.  According to Yates, the termination of normal trade relations with China would have serious consequences. Rather than revoke MFN, Yates outlines a policy which he holds to be more consistent and cohesive than that carried out so far by President Clinton. This policy, whose aim is to promote both democracy and improved U.S. Chinese relations, includes: 1) renewing China's MFN status; 2) inviting China's president to the White House for a full state visit; 3) following a more broad-based strategy towards Asia; 4) using policy tools better suited to the problem; and 5) repealing or amending the Jackson-Vanik amendment. 12pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a>

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/trade/lect566.html">China: Friend or Enemy?</a> by Hon. Barbara Hackman Franklin<p>
<i>Lecture</i> No. 566, The Heritage Foundation<p>
Barbara Hackman Franklin, former Secretary of Commerce examines the relationship between the United States and China in light of China's growing economic, geographic and military importance.  Despite China's increasing commitment to free market principles, Franklin sees human rights, trade deficits, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and intellectual property rights as obstacles to improving ties between the two countries. Even with these difficulties, however, Franklin believes the U.S. must continue to strengthen its relationship with China. Only by doing so can the U.S. help to strengthen the democratic and free market ideas currently gaining strength in China. She argues that the current U.S. policy lacks consistency and direction. Her remedy for this problem is the adoption of a strategic framework, outlining the goals, objectives, and expectations for the United States' relationship with China.  Included in this framework would be actions such as granting China permanent Most Favored Nation status and bringing the country into the World Trade Organization.  Franklin concludes by asserting that only by strengthening its economic and political ties with China, can the U.S. help direct the course China will take in the years to come. 9 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org</a>

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/lect562.html">Entering the Pacific Century,</a> by Senator Jesse Helms<p>
<i>Lecture</i> No. 562, The Heritage Foundation<p>
United States Senator Jesse Helms calls for a shift in America's policy towards Asian nations, condemning the Clinton Administration for its indecisiveness and lack of priorities.  Helms believes continued support for political and economic freedom should be first on America's Asian agenda.  He asserts that the U.S. must use a firmer hand in dealing with the People's Republic of China, refusing to tolerate China's flagrant abuses of human rights and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.  Helms also argues that the U.S. must encourage Japan to take a leadership role in the international community commensurate with its economic standing. Facilitating dialogues between North and South Korea, and India and Pakistan figure significantly in Helm's agenda for U.S.-Asian relations. Finally, Helms cautions that the U.S. must pay close attention to Russia's dealings with Asian nations and work closely with states in ASEAN in order to promote democracy in Vietnam, Burma, and Laos.  According to Helms, the U.S. must adopt a more cohesive Asian policy if it is to be prepared for the emergence of Asia as the focal point of political and economic power in the near future. 20pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org</a>.

<b>Terrorism: The Failed Response,</b> by Geoffrey Lee Williams and Alan Lee Williams<p>
<i>Occasional Paper</i> No. 66, Institute for European Defense and Strategic Studies<p>
Geoffrey Lee Williams, Professor of International Relations at the University of Cambridge, and Alan Lee Williams, Director of the Atlantic Council of the United Kingdom, argue that although the power to terrorize with weapons and violence as a means to an end has a very long tradition, modern terrorists are distinguished from their predecessors by an adherence to ideology. Marx, Lenin, and Mao all considered violence to be useful only as an instrument for the advancement of the revolution. However, they were wary of the use of terror because the shedding of innocent blood could alienate "the masses." The authors also offer definitions in order to provide distinction between the various terms and euphemisms for terrorists. In addition, they encourage governments to cooperate in order to avoid further violence. 55pp.  CONTACT.

<b>Privatization 1996,</b> edited by John O'Leary<p>
<i>Tenth Annual Report on Privatization</i>, Reason Foundation<p>
In this annual report, the Reason Foundation provides a comprehensive account of privatization of government assets, enterprises, and public services. The first section focuses on trends towards privatization in the public sector at the federal, state and local levels. The next area of analysis examines the politics of privatization, looking especially at the experiences of Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith and New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman. Then, the report examines tools which will enable the government to understand the trends of activity based costing, contract monitoring techniques, and the use of competition within government.  This year's survey also covers contracting trends such as education privatization, solid waste management, and emergency medical services.  The final section of analysis looks at infrastructure trends, examining how industries as diverse as air traffic control, electric power, and corrections facilities are making the transition towards privatization.  68pp.  CONTACT: Reason Foundation, 3415 S.

<p><b>Designing Comprehensive Privatization Programs for Cities: Pittsburgh,</b> by John Stainbeck and Paul Kengor<p>
<i>Allegheny Institute Report</i> No. 96-14, Allegheny Institute and Reason Foundation<p>
John Stainback, President and CEO of Privatization for America, and Paul Kengor, Research Fellow for the Allegheny Institute, examine the challenges faced by city governments struggling with falling revenues and rising expenditures. Their solution centers around a comprehensive city-wide privatization program. The program involves nine different types of privatization for a city's assets, services, facility operations, debt, and infrastructure. The plan relies on government involvement in the creation and implementation of the privatization process. In an attempt to strengthen their governing ability and improve the quality of services provided to their citizens, city officials work to determine the types of privatization their situation demands, the level of control they want to maintain, and the assets they are willing to put into play.  Stainback and Kengor caution that while some risks do exist, they are still far outweighed by the benefits comprehensive privatization holds. These include: 1) reduced government costs; 2) generation of non-tax revenue; and 3) improved capabilities of developing and financing infrastructure. 46pp.  CONTACT: Allegheny Institute for Public Policy, Suite 612, 7 Parkway Center, Pittsburgh, PA 15220-3703, 412/937-4526, fax 412/928-1501

<b>Power Struggle</b>, by Kerry Jackson<p>
<i>FYI</i> May 8, 1996, American Legislative Exchange Council<p>
Kerry Jackson, Editor of <i>FYI</i>, examines the current move towards deregulating the electric power industry.  According to Jackson, while some consumer groups and utility companies have reservations about opening up the electric power market to competition, the move toward deregulation grows stronger everyday, particularly among industry insiders. As Jackson points out, legislators in approximately 30 states are devising legislation that would provide the best service to consumers, but in a low-cost, competitive market. ALEC is addressing the issue with its Energy, Environment, Natural Resources, and Agriculture Task Force. Jackson concludes that competition within the electric power industry will lower costs for consumers and offer them the best form of consumer protection possible. 4pp.  CONTACT: American Legislative Exchange Council, 910 17th Street, N.W., 5th floor, Washington, DC  20006, 202/466-3800, fax 202/466-3801.

<b>Reinventing Air Traffic Control: A New Blueprint for a Better System,</b> by Robert Poole and Viggo Butler<p>
<i>Policy Study</i> No. 206, Reason Foundation<p>
Robert Poole, President of Reason Foundation, and Viggo Butler, Chairman of United Airports Limited, Inc., assert that the Federal Aviation Administration: possesses a bureaucratic subculture; is subject to external micromanagement; and suffers from conflicts of interest between safety regulation and air traffic control operation.  In order to solve this problem, they set forth a plan by which a system of user fees would replace the current airline ticket tax and general aviation fuel tax. The authors believe that doing so would cure many of the FAA's structural weaknesses, leading to improved air safety, fewer flight delays, and shrunken operating costs. The new fee structure would be determined by aircraft weight and distance flown, and would exempt smaller, private aircrafts from most fees and taxes. To determine the fee structure, Poole and Butler recommend the development of a new user-controlled, not-for-profit Air Traffic Control corporation. Modeled after the ATC board which will soon assume control of Canada's air traffic control, the board would be set up and controlled by the government, air traffic controllers, airlines, and business aircraft owners. The new ATC system would be funded entirely by user fees and would be subject to arms length regulation by the FAA. Poole and Butler conclude that if the United States follows the example of not only Canada, but also Germany, Britain, and Switzerland, the fundamental problems of the system can be solved.19pp  CONTACT: Reason Foundation, 3415 S.

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/bg1085.html">Senator Pressler's Bold Proposal for Spectrum Freedom,</a> by <a href="/heritage/staff/thierer.htm">Adam D. Thierer</a><p>
<i>Backgrounder</i> No. 1085, The Heritage Foundation<p>
Adam D. Thierer, Alex C. Walker Fellow in Economic Policy at The Heritage Foundation, examines Senator Larry Pressler's staff discussion draft intended to enforce a complete overhaul of the United States' wireless spectrum regulatory policy. Thierer asserts that the Senator's reform proposal is badly needed because the current system suffers from a host of problems, including a resistance to change and a lack of respect for First Amendment rights. According to Thierer, Pressler's plan would: 1) provide spectrum flexibility; 2) expand and make permanent the auction and allocation process; 3) create a second broadcast spectrum solution; 4) prohibit FCC spectrum standard-setting or construction mandates; 5) demand release of more publicly held spectrum; 6) transfer all spectrum responsibilities from the National Telecommunications and Information Administration to the FCC and block grant public safety spectrum to the states; and 7) require a spectrum report to monitor progress. While Thierer, on the whole, endorses Pressler's proposal, he lists four changes which he believes would improve upon the initial plan. These include: holding outright, unambiguous auctions for all spectrum uses and users;  ending "public interest standard" regulation and guaranteeing equal First Amendment protections for all media, whether print or electronic; ending protectionist policies in spectrum technologies; and  de-licensing the entire spectrum. 11 pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a>

<b>A Free Market Solution to Groundwater Allocation in Georgia,</b> by Terry L. Anderson and Pamela S. Snyder<p>
<i>Issue Analysis,</i> Georgia Public Policy Foundation<p>
Terry Anderson, Executive Director of Political Economy Research Center (PERC), and Pamela Snyder, a PERC Research Assistant with, discuss the overuse of the Floridian aquifer system by groundwater pumpers in Georgia. Anderson and Snyder write that the state's use of regulation to reverse overdraft of the aquifer is not being welcomed with open arms, but, in the absence of well-defined property rights to groundwater, water users "race to the pumphouse" to capture their share of the resources before someone else does. The authors offer a market-based alternative to proposed government regulation, calling for privatization of the Floridian aquifer system in Georgia on a regional basis by defining quantified groundwater rights and allowing their transfer among users. 20 pp.  CONTACT: Georgia Public Policy Foundation, 2900 Chamblee-Tucker Road, Building Six, Atlanta, GA 30341-4128, 770/455-7600, fax 770/455-4355.

<b>California's Fiscal Condition,</b> by Tom McClintock<p>
<i>Briefings</i> No. 1996-51, Claremont Institute<p>
Tom McClintock, Director of Economic and Regulatory Affairs at the Claremont Institute's Golden State Center for Policy Studies, writes that, despite some positive signs, the California economy is still not stable. Attributing California's recession in the early 1990s to dramatic tax increases, McClintock points to a growing state debt, deferral of pension loans, and several bookkeeping anomalies as key indicators of impending economic difficulties. With these economic weaknesses, he holds that California is ill-repared to deal with its crumbling infrastructure. Noting that while spending per capita had increased significantly over the past twenty years, California is now providing fewer-and poorer-quality services to its citizens. Based upon this, McClintock concludes that California's problems stem not from how much revenue the state is receiving but rather how that revenue is spent. To remedy this problem, McClintock suggests two fundamental shifts in how California's policy makers allocate the budget: 1) restoring the state's constitutional restraints requiring a balanced budget, prohibiting borrowing, and limiting spending growth; and 2) downsizing the state bureaucracy and incorporating more competitive, free market oriented principles into the provision of goods and services. 9pp.  CONTACT: The Claremont Institute, 250 West First Street, Suite 330, Claremont, CA 91711, 909/621-6825, fax 909/626-8724, e-mail <a href="mailto: 2026935@mcimail.com">2026935@mcimail.com</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.claremont.org">http://www.claremont.org.</a><p>

<b>Small Business Survival Index: Ranking the Environment for Entrepreneurship Across the Nation,</b> by Raymond J. Keating<p>
Small Business Survival Foundation<p>
Raymond J. Keating, Chief Economist for the Small Business Foundation, examines the impact of a variety of taxes on small businesses on a state by state basis.  Asserting that how a government manages issues of investment and entrepreneurship is a vital economic matter, he concludes that high taxes and burdensome regulations will significantly reduce incentives for entrepreneurs to engage in high risk ventures. The end result of this process, according to Keating, is the restraint and diminishment of economic growth.  In order to provide both entrepreneurs and legislators with a more comprehensive understanding of the comparative degree to which their state promotes investment and growth, Keating ranks and measures some of the major costs imposed on entrpreneurship, investment, and businesses in each state.The Index surveys nine major government related costs imposed on small businesses and entrepreneurs. The taxes compared include: personal income taxes; capital gains taxes; corporate income taxes; property taxes; sales taxes; and death taxes. The survey also looks at the impact of unemployment tax rates, workers' compensation costs, and the total crime rate on small businesses.  Using these nine factors to shape his analysis, Keating summarizes the climate of each state for investment and small business opportunities.  13pp.  CONTACT.

<b>Social Security: Facing the Facts,</b> by Mark Weinberger<p>
<i>Project on Social Security Privatization</i> No. 3, Cato Institute<p>
Mark Weinberger, a partner in the law firm Washington Council, P.C., singles out Congress for their failure to address Social Security reform in the midst of the budget debate. Weinberger shows that the Social Security program could begin going bankrupt as early as 2113. He attributes this problem to the combined impact of the "graying of America," combined with increased costs and higher standards of living. To remedy this situation, Weinberger asserts lawmakers have four options: 1) reduce benefit payments; 2) increase the program's funding; 3) run up the federal debt; or 4) restructure the program so that people can save money in private accounts yielding higher returns. It is the fourth option, Weinberg endorses, concluding that it has the best potential for averting a potential crisis. 10pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20001, 202/842-0200, fax 202/842-3490, e-mail <a href="mailto: cato@cato.org">cato@cato.org</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.cato.org">http://www.cato.org.</a><p>

<b>Empowering Workers: The Privatization of Social Security in Chile,</b> by Jos Pinera<p>
<i>Cato's Letters</i> No. 10, Cato Institute<p>
Jos Piera, President of the International Center for Pension Reform and Co-Chairman of the Cato Project on Social Security Privatization, is the former Chilean Minister of Labor and Social Security. During his tenure from 1978-1980 he oversaw the privatization of the Chilean pension system. In this paper, Piera discusses the international trend of bankrupt pension systems, how he successfully privatized the Chilean pension system, and how the new Chilean system has increased the productivity of capital and thus the rate of economic growth in its economy. This paper sheds light on how Americans might solve the immenent crisis in their own Social Secutity system. 18pp.  CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200, fax 202/842-3490, e-mail <a href="mailto: cato@cato.org">cato@cato.org</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.cato.org">http://www.cato.org.</a><p>

<b>Private Means, Public Ends: Volunteerism vs. Coercion,</b> edited by J. Wilson Mixon, Jr.<p>
Foundation for Economic Education, Inc.<p>
This collection of twenty-six essays, Edited by J. Wilson Mixon, Jr., Professor of Economics at Berry College, challenges the assumption that the government is the best institution to provide basic services such as policing, a transportation infrastructure, and education.  In his introduction, Mixon argues that while the trend towards privatization is gaining support, most people still endorse government involvement in activities as diverse as mail delivery and banking.  But it is because of the government's long standing involvement in these services, Mixon asserts, people have forgotten that private initiatives are also capable of meeting society's many needs.  In fact, as one essay, authored by Henry Hazlitt, concludes, private, voluntary means are actually more effective in serving the community than forced government initiatives.  Other selected essays by Barbara Dodsworth, William R. Allen, and William Dickneider focus on the relationship of government funding and art.  Clint Bolick and Raymond J. Keating write against regulation of the communications industry, while Hannah Lapp and Scott Payne make the case for increased privatization of education.  The revitalization of private charity rather than public welfare is discussed by authors including Gerald Wisz, Robert Peterson, and David T. Beito.  Finally, the deregulation and privatization of banking, transportation, and law enforcement, are the focus of essays by Richard Syll, William B. Irvine, and Nicholas Elliott.    CONTACT.

<b>The Uncertain Hand: Hong Kong Taxis and Tenders,</b> by Christopher D. Hall<p>
Hong Kong Center for Economic Research<p>
The history of taxi regulation in Hong Kong shows that the uncertain regulation is the major source of risk in that business, according to Christopher Hall, Senior Lecturer in the School of Economics and Finance at the University of Hong Kong. After World War II, the taxi business in Hong Kong was basically a cartel of more expensive brand name operators controlled by the police as if it were a private enterprise with public monopoly rights. By the mid-1960s the burgeoning transport-bureaucracy introduced public auctions to allocate licences and, in effect, stripped the police of their power to control the business. The illegal taxi trade grew soon after. In 1985, the current de facto arrangement came about in which licence holders have gradually gained control of the taxi business. Hall argues that the taxi business would be a safe investment if regulation change, real and suggested, did not create so much uncertainty. 266 pp.  CONTACT: Hong Kong Center for Economic Research, School of Economics, The University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam Road, Hong Kong, 852/2547-8313, fax 852/2548-6319

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/tp14.html">Creating a Financial Services Industry for the 21st Century Part One: Tear Down the Walls,</a> by <a href="/heritage/staff/barry.html">John S. Barry</a><p>
<i>Heritage Talking Points</i> The Heritage Foundation<p>
John S. Barry, Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation, condemns the current financial regulatory system which mandates the forced separation of financial services.  According to Barry, historically barriers were created between commercial and investment banking because of fears of high risk losses and conflicts of interest. But he argues that these fears are groundless, that in fact banks engaging in investment activities are less likely to fail than those that did not. He also asserts that integrated banks are less likely to succumb to conflicts of interest than purely commercial or investment banks. Having addressed the major arguments against bank integration, Barry outlines the following plan for modernizing America's financial services industry: 1) repealing the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956; 2) repealing the Banking Act of 1933; 3) eliminating federal regulatory barriers to integrated financial service provision; and 4) allowing commercial companies to offer financial services such as individual savings and checking accounts, consumer lines of credit, and diversified investment services. Barry holds that the implementation of these suggestions will benefit both American businesses and consumers, providing them with more profitable investment opportunities, easier access to capital, reduced costs, and a more stable financial services sector. 17pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a>

<i>F.Y.I.</i> No. 102, The Heritage Foundation<p>
Mark Wilson, Rebecca Lukens Fellow in Labor Policy at The Heritage Foundation, and Angela Antonelli, Heritage Deputy Director for Economic Policy, illustrate that the real problem behind workers' declining take-home pay is not a low minimum wage, but rather the hidden costs of government mandates, taxes, and regulations. According to Wilson and Antonelli, government mandated benefits, ranging from unemployment insurance to workers compensation, dramatically increase the cost to employers to hire and keep workers on their payrolls. They also point out that growing numbers of government regulations increase the cost of employing workers and in the long-run drive down productivity, further escalating costs. Wilson and Antonelli assert that if Congress truly wants to increase wages and job opportunities for American workers they should not raise the minimum wage. Rather, they should focus on reducing the costs of employing workers by cutting payroll taxes; cutting the capital gains tax; enacting significant regulatory reform; and increasing the skills of the workforce. 10pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a>

<b>How Corporate Welfare Won: Clinton and Congress Retreat from Cutting Business Subsidies,</b> by Stephen Moore and Dean Stansel<p>
<i>Policy Analysis</i> No. 254, Cato Institute<p> 
Stephen Moore, Director of Fiscal Policy Studies at the Cato Institute, and Dean Stansel, Cato Fiscal Policy analyst, demonstrate that the federal government currently spends $75 billion a year on direct subsidies to business. Despite that last year both Congress and the Clinton Adminstration pledged to attack this pervasive corporate safety net, the study finds that those promises have been largely unfulfilled. The study reveals that many corporate subsidy programs were reduced minimally, or not at all. In addition, the Clinton Administration has shown itself hostile to even the modest corporate welfare cutbacks proposed by Congress. In fact, the Administration's 1996 budget actually requested a slight increase in spending. The report concludes that an unwillingness to reduce the corporate social safety net undermines the rest of the government downsizing agenda. 29pp.  CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200, fax 202/842-3490, e-mail <a href="mailto: cato@cato.org">cato@cato.org</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.cato.org">http://www.cato.org.</a><p>


<b>Georgia Jobs Tax Credits: Needed Incentives or Needless Subsidies?</b> by Dr. Steve Morse<p>
<i>Issue Analysis,</i> Georgia Public Policy Foundation<p>
Dr. Steve Morris, a member of the Academic Advisory Board at the Georgia Center for Public Policy, argues that tax incentives passed in Georgia in 1994 to attract business were unnecessary and fail to address the real needs of Georgia's businesses. According to Morse, while such actions sound good in theory, in reality they have been proven to do little to affect a state's overall economic development. He bases his arguments on over thirty years of studies showing that most tax incentive programs simply give unnecessary tax incentives to businesses to do what they would have done anyway. Morse believes that if Georgia wishes to remain economically competitive in the coming years, it must abandon its current agenda of unnecessary tax incentives and adopt a policy which  focuses on factors businesses find truly important when making location decisions.  These factors include: 1) the availability of an educated and trainable workforce; 2) low taxes; 3) a high quality of life; 4) first-class research and development facilities; and 5) non-burdensome regulations. 9pp.  CONTACT: Georgia Public Policy Foundation, 2900 Chamblee-Tucker Road, Building Six, Atlanta, GA 30341-4128, 770/455-7600, fax 770/455-4355.

<b>How Title XI Ship Subsidies Sink the Taxpayer,</b> by John S. Tottie<p>
<i>Issue Analysis</i> No. 28, Citizens for a Sound Economy<p>
John S. Tottie, a Policy Analyst at Citizens for a Sound Economy, argues that the 60 year old Title XI Federal Ship Financing Guarantee Program, which guarantees loans for a wide variety of vessels and shipyard modernization projects, has accumulated $1 billion in loan defaults. Tottie posits that the case against Title XI is the case against entrenched political pork. Because the Title XI loans have a "subsidy value" and the resources available for investment are not unlimited, the government's favoritism of the shipbuilding industry also means that other goods and services that consumers want will be less plentiful. Tottie continues that any defense of Title XI must explain why the government, and not the American people, should decide how scarce economic resources are to be allocated. In conclusion, Tottie believes Title XI should be repealed. 16pp.  CONTACT: Citizens for a Sound Economy, 1250 H Street, N.W., Suite 700, Washington, DC 20005-3908, 202/783-3870, fax 202/783-4687, Internet <a href="http://www.cse.org/cse">http://www.cse.org/cse.</a>

<b>White House Tax Theories,</b> by Alan Reynolds<p>
<i>Hudson Briefing Paper</i> No. 191, Hudson Institute<p>
Alan Reynolds, Director of Economic Research at Hudson Institute, critically anaylzes <I>The President's Council of Economic Adviser's 1996 Economic Report</i> assertion that changing tax rates have had no discernable effect on work effort, productivity, savings and economic growth. Reynolds debunks the myths presented by the CEA report which declares that the reduction of tax rates in the early 1980s was responsible for the large budget deficits that have persisted since. The Economic Report also states that whereas the impact of tax policy on savings is ambiguous, the ability of decreasing fedeal budget deficits to increase national savings is perfectly clear. Reynolds argues that the report does not bolster its finding with facts, and dismisses inconvenient truths as though they have become politically incorrect, in effect asking Americans to disregard scientific method in favor of naked politics and raw emotion. 16pp.  CONTACT: Hudson Institute, Herman Kahn Center, P.O.

<i>Backgrounder</i> No. 1084. The Heritage Foundation<p>
Robert Rector, Senior Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation, dispels some of the myths and misconceptions associated with welfare and children. He argues that children are suffering simply because the U.S. welfare system has failed. Furthermore, the system has failed because the ideas upon which it was founded are flawed. Rector writes that flawed assumptions that children in families with higher income do better in life, and that welfare can easily raise family income, amount to the false conclusion that welfare is good for children. Rather, Rector points out, welfare has detrimental effects on cognitive capabilities, negatively effects the long term employment and earning capacity of young boys, and promotes illegitimacy. Rector concludes that those truly concerned with the welfare of children must seek a radical transformation of the welfare system aimed not at increasing welfare spending and enrollment, but at reducing dependency and illegitimacy. 14pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<b>Unintended Consequences: How Government Policies Hurt Oregon's Poor,</b> by Martin L. Buchanan<p>
<i>Fiscal Insight</i> No. 12, Cascade Policy Institute<p>
Martin Buchanan, Policy Analyist for the Cascade Policy Institute, argues that government policy at many levels is actually hurting Oregon's poor families in four ways. In order to escape poverty, families or individuals must surmount four barriers which Buchanan likens to four Berlin Walls. These barriers consist of taxes on the poor, obstacles to employment and enterprise, forced purchases of certain services, and higher prices for the poor. The paper also recommends several government actions to help poor Oregonians at the federal, state and local levels. Buchanan believes that the interests of the poor align well with the general interest and if these burdens are lifted from the poor, the burdens will lighten for all. 12pp.  CONTACT: Cascade Policy Institute, 813 S.W.

<i>Backgrounder</i> No. 1081, The Heritage Foundation<p>
Ronald Utt, Visiting Fellow at The Heritage Foundation, reports on Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry Cisneros's plan to introduce the benefits of market competition into the public housing industry despite efforts to hinder the plan by an alliance of moderate Republicans and liberal Democrats. However, with the support of House reformers and leaders, in conjunction with bold intervention by the federal courts, Utt believes, there is a good chance that these needed reforms in America's New Deal housing policies will survive the lobbying efforts of a public housing industry determined to preserve its costly taxpayer-supported monopoly over housing for the poor. Utt argues that this clash over housing reform is far more than a dispute over spending levels. Rather, the dispute concerns how government should help the poor. 13pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<b>The Value of Welfare: Cato vs. CBPP,</b> by Michael Tanner and Naomi Lopez<p>
<i>Briefing Papers</i> No. 27, Cato Institute<p>
Michael Tanner and Naomi Lopez of the Cato Institute reviewed the Center on Budget and Policy Priority's critique of the Cato study comparing the benefits available from entitlement programs with income available from work. Tanner and Lopez maintain that a review of the original study published by Cato and the criticisms in the CBPP study reveals that the Cato study remains an accurate appraisal of the level of welfare benefits. The study, by Tanner and Lopez, states that the CBPP report fails to account for the values of non-cash welfare benefits such as Medicaid. In addition, the Cato study's inclusion of housing benefits more accurately reflects the work vs. welfare tradeoff for long term welfare recipients. Turner and Lopez conclude that with the exception of a small error in the calculation of the values of food stamps in five states, the criticisms of the Cato study are unfounded. 29pp.  CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200, fax 202/842-3490, e-mail <a href="mailto: cato@cato.org">cato@cato.org</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.cato.org">http://www.cato.org.</a><p>

<b>Replacing Welfare in Wisconsin,</b> by Andrew Bush<p>

Andrew Busch, Assistant Professor of Political Science at The University of Denver, examines Wisconsin's new welfare reform program. This new program, "Wisconsin Works" (W-2), is a work-based system which tries to help parents establish their own means of long-term support, primarily through work. The focus of W-2 will be with its financial and employment planners (FEP's), who will help families plan and execute employment strategies. The idea behind W-2 is that consistent employment is the way out of poverty, and finding a job for unemployed parents is only the beginning of the process-showing them how to keep a job is the real aim. 8pp. CONTACT: Hudson Institute, Herman Kahn Center, P.O.

<b>A Working Solution to the Welfare Crisis: The Full Employment Model of Welfare Reform,</b> by Peter S. Barwick<p>
Commonwealth Foundation<p>
Peter S. Barwick, Research Associate for The Commonwealth Foundation, posits that thirty years after the inauguration of the Great Society, it is clear that the welfare state has failed to deliver on its promise to end poverty. In fact, there is now a broad consensus that welfare programs have contributed substantially, if unintentionally, to a worsening of the plight of the poor by undermining the two-parent family and a commitment to work. Barwick presents the Full Employment Model as a promising and fully developed proposal for reforming the current welfare system. The merits of the reforms are detailed and the improvements of the current system are underscored. Advantages cited by Barwick include an end to welfare as an entitlement and the provision of practical work experience. However, Barwick acknowledges and explores important questions raised by the Full Employment Model such as the cost and the role of the bureaucracy. 12pp.  CONTACT: The Commonwealth Foundation for Public Policy Alternatives, 3544 North Progress Avenue, Suite 101, Harrisburg, PA  17110, 717/671-1901, fax 717/671-1905.

<b>Challenging America's Inverted Health Priorities,</b> by Elizabeth M. Whelan<p>
<i>Priorities</i> Vol. 8 No. 1, American Council on Science and Health<p>
This speech by Elizabeth M. Whelan, President of the American Council on Science and Health (ACSH), relates that her top priority at ACSH involves helping Americans distinguish between real and hypothetical health risks, and to separate the leading causes of disease and death from the leading causes of unnecessary anxiety. She argues that the purpose of public health measures, whether carried out at EPA, the FDA, in Congress, or in the private sector, should be the prevention of premature disease and death. She rejects the notion that public health efforts should have hidden goals which might include harassing industy, alarming people about nonrisks, banning useful, subtances or advancing other social and political agendas. Whelan posits that the nation's health priorities are inverted because health issues are pushed to center stage, squandering limited public health resources. Examples include the mother who worries about the alleged carcinogin Alar in applesauce, but fails to buckle her child into a car. She suggests that the influential factors creating inverted health policies include the enormous political and economic clout of the manufacturers of the leading cause of preventable death, cigarettes ,and the contamination of the public health profession by an ideologically fueled form of political correctness that chills open dialouge. 10pp.  CONTACT.

Courtney LaFountain, Environmental Researcher at the Center for the Study of American Business, offers nine fundamental questions that readers should ask when evaluating a story about a new risk. LaFountain's concern focuses on press coverage of studies of three possible environmental health risks to show that many of these points are not addressed in media coverage of risk-based research. The author suggests that journalists have a tendency to report the political or human interest side of a risk, rather than the technical or scientific side. Her nine point plan for the analysis of information involves inquiries which are directed toward correcting false information and disclosing the whole story on partial reporting. Cases she applies her nine point plan to include the major news coverage of the Savitz-Loomis Study, the Long Island Breast Cancer Study and the Greenpeace Chlorine Study. 24pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington University, Campus Box 1208, St. Louis, MO 63130-4899, 314/935-5630, fax 314/935-5688.

<b>FDA Reform, Take One: Chairman Kassebaum's Bill,</b> by Michael F. Cannon<p>
<i>Issue Analysis </I>No. 27, Citizens for a Sound Economy<p>
Michael F. Cannon, Health Care Policy Analyst at Citizens for a Sound Economy, discusses Nancy Kassebaum's Food and Drug Administration Performance and Accountability Act of 1996. Cannon believes the proposal addresses the FDA's obstruction of doctors' and patients' efforts to obtain badly needed treatments, the rise in health care costs, and violations of the First Amendment. These proposals include such measures as refocusing the FDA's mission and balancing the agency's safety and efficacy standards against the needs of the seriously ill. The bill would also allow FDA accredited private firms to review product applications on behalf of the agency and would shorten the time it takes to bring drugs, medical devices and biologics to market, where they may help patients. Though not without shortcomings and with several provisions yet to be added to the bill, Cannon believes the Kassebaum Bill will enable doctors and patients to obtain new treatments faster, and at a lower cost, than under the current regulatory regime-without compromising patient safety. 9pp.  CONTACT: Citizens for a Sound Economy, 1250 H Street, N.W., Suite 700, Washington, DC 20005-3908, 202/783-3870, fax 202/783-4687, Internet <a href="http://www.cse.org/cse">http://www.cse.org/cse.</a><p>

<b>Medical Savings Accounts: The Singapore Experience,</b> by Thomas A. Massaro and Yu-Ning Wong<p>
<i>NCPA Policy Report</i> No. 203, National Center for Policy Analysis<p>
Thomas Massaro, Harrison Foundation Professor of Medicine and Law, analyzes Medical Savings Accounts in Singapore and has revealed a system which offers individuals access to care while holding down costs. According to the study, the island city-state spends only 3.1 percent of its gross domestic product on health care, lower than other Asian nations and well below the United States at 154 percent. In addition, Singaporeans have access to the most modern technology, including CAT scans, bypass surgery and organ transplants. Moreover, there is very little waiting in Singapore, either to see a doctor or to obtain high technology services. Massaro argues that the fact that people are spending their own money, rather than a third party insurer, has helped to curtail Singapore's health care costs. Also, because people are free to exercise choice in the medical marketplace, providers of care have strong incentives to maintain quality. The study concludes that if Medical Savings Accounts were available in the United States, prudent buying would begin to chip away at the high price of care and might significantly reduce it. 19pp.  CONTACT: National Center for Policy Analysis, 12655 N.

<b>Immigration and America's Cities: A Sign of Economic Health,</b> by Stephen Moore<p>

Moore's study of America's 85 largest cities, using Census data over a 15-year period, which demonstrates that high levels of immigration are generally associated with cities that have more positive economic indicators. The study finds that, compared to cities with the fewest immigrants, cities with the highest proportion of immigrants in 1990 had on average: 15% higher per capita incomes; 90% lower tax burdens; 130% higher job growth; 17% lower crime rates; and 17% lower poverty rates. 48pp. CONTACT: The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, 1611 North Kent Street, Suite 901, Arlington, VA  22209, 703/351-4969, fax 703/351-0090.

<b>Judging an Interest Group by the Politicians it Keeps: An Analysis of NEA-PAC Contributions to House Races,</b> by John Berthoud<p>
<i>Issue Brief</i> No. 120, Alexis de Tocqueville Institution<p>
John  Berthoud, Vice President of the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, relates that a review of contributions by the political action committee of the National Education Association reveals that the Congress that NEA is seeking to elect would radically change the direction of American government. Most significantly, NEA's ideal Congress would vastly expand federal spending and taxation. The average House candidate supported by the NEA during the last election cycle had an agenda to increase federal spending by $302 billion per year. On the other hand, the candidates that the NEA opposed had a net agenda to cut federal spending by $22.6 billion per year. Berthoud also states that, despite NEA's pledge of support for America's children, if NEA could have the Congress it wanted, it would mean either hundreds of billions of dollars in new taxes on American families or hundreds of billions of dollars in deficits for future generations. 7pp.  CONTACT: The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, 1611 North Kent Street, Suite 901, Arlington, VA  22209, 703/351-4969, fax 703/351-0090.

<i>Committee Brief</i> No. 26, The Heritage Foundation<p>
Denis Doyle, Heritage Visiting Fellow in Education, argues that Congress has a historic opportunity to convert Title I, Education for the Disadvantaged, into a voucher program. He proposes that poor families, rather than bureaucrats, decide where their children will go to school. Doyle cites the widely recognized problems with Title I, including the adverse effect of the Supreme Court's Aguilar decision which actively discourages poor children from attending non-government schools by penalizing them if they do. Doyle concludes that in order to reform Title I, the program should be reconnecting to its true beneficiaries-students and not schools. As it is, Title I commits more than $1,000 to each eligible child and if that money were available as a Title I voucher it would permit children to select schools that best serve their needs. Such an approach, writes Doyle, would mitigate the effects of the school bureaucracy and begin to instill values which foster character development. 5pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<b>Bilingual Education in Massachusetts, The Emperor Has No Clothes,</b> by Christine H. Rossell and Keith Baker<p>
Pioneer Institute for Public Policy Research<p>
Christine Rossell, Professor of Political Science at Boston University, and Keith Baker, a private social science research consultant, thoroughly examine the bilingual education program in Massachusetts public schools for limited English-proficient (LEP) students. They look at the controversial aspects of bilingual education nationwide,and they survey the history of bilingual education in Massachusetts.  Rossell and Baker provide eight recommendations for improving edicuational programs for LEP students: 1) free school districts from the legal obligation to provide native language instruction; 2) increase the LEP population size needed to trigger a self-contained classroom; 3) require parental consent for enrollment in a self-contained classroom; 4) require English language fluency for teachers in an educationl program for LEP children; 5) change the criteria for entering and exiting a self-contained classroom; 6) eliminate specific class-sized ceilings; 7) better research that would allow social scientists to analyze the success of the programs; and 8) the ideal program is that which involves "structured immersions." 242 pp. CONTACT: Pioneer Institute For Public Policy Research, 85 Devonshire Street, 8th floor, Boston, MA 2109, 617/723-2277, fax 617/723-1880.

<b>The Heartland Report on School Finance Reform for Illinois,</b> by Joseph L. Bast, Herbert J. Walberg, and Robert J. Genetski<p>
<i>Policy Studies</i> No. 72 and 73, Heartland Institute<p>
Joseph L. Bast, President of The Heartland Institute, Herbert J. Walberg of the University of Illinois at Chicago, and Robert J. Genetski of Chicago Capital, Inc., formulate a reply to the Governor's Commission on Education Funding and offer alternative principles for school finance reform. The report cites evidence which demonstrates why public schools are failing in Illinois, such as excessive bureaucracy and regulation. Moreover, the writers maintain that spending more money will not alleviate the situation. They argue that student achievement is not related to spending because increased spending rarely addresses the reasons schools are failing. The second part of the report offers a means to improve public schools through a market-based approach. The plan incorporates parental choice, private school choice, competition, and curriculum based exams to improve the quality, and the means to gauge the quality, of public schools.

<b>With Liberty and Justice for All: Redefining the Educational Choice Debate,</b> by Jennifer A. Marshall and Jennifer E. Marshall,<p>
<i>Family Policy,</i> Family Research Council<p>
Jennifer A Marshall, Educational Policy Analyst for the Family Research Council, and Jennifer E. Marshall, Welfare Policy Analyst for the Family Research Council, survey the philosophical and historical background of public education. They assert that, given the failure to establish a full educational choice program anywhere in the U.S. after a quarter century, choice proponents must challenge themselves to develop a new scheme. The proposal should place a premium on liberty and on the private benefits of education while reformulating the public-purpose rhetoric employed by the education establishment. Marshall and Marshall also believe the new proposal should avoid the weaknesses associated with vouchers, including the menace of government regulation, consistent challenges to constitutionality, dim prospects for political passage, the danger of expanding an entitlement mentality and a narrow coalition of beneficiaries to support passage. The authors invest faith in a refundable tax credit scheme to overleap the hurdles presented by means tested voucher programs. 7pp.  CONTACT: Family Research Council, 700 13th Street, N.W., Suite 500, Washington, DC  20005, 202/393-2100, fax 202/393-2134, Internet <a href="http://www.frc.org">http://www.frc.org.</a>

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/tp15.html">How to Talk About Property Rights: Why Protecting Property Rights Benefits All Americans, </a>by John Shanahan<p>
Heritage Talking Points No. 15, The Heritage Foundation<p>
John Shanahan, Policy Analyst for The Heritage Foundation, argues that although the government has the power to confiscate private land, it must compensate the owner. However, when government regulates how private owners may use their land, it typically does so without any recognition of, or compensation for, the costs. Shanahan notes that this de facto taking of property-the practice of restricting a person's right to use his property without compensating him for losses caused by the restriction-is now being questioned. The author discusses House and Senate bills which would protect private property and contract rights. Shanahan also offers the philosophical groundwork concerning the importance of private property. Shanahan laments that although the Supreme Court has clearly sided with the Constitution when requiring the government to pay just compensation when any amount of land is confiscated, the Court's decisions regarding regulatory takings have been less clear. As a result, executive branch agencies have had wide latitude in taking property through regulation. 4pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<b>Regulation vs. Conservation,</b> by Jonathan H. Adler<p>
<i>CEI Update </i>Vol. 9, No. 5, Competitive Enterprise Institute<p>
Jonathan Adler, Director of Environmental Studies at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, illustrates how regulation, the primary means that the federal government employs to protect endangered species and ecologically sensitive lands, might actually discourage voluntary stewardship and conservation of private property. He calls for non-regulatory, incentive based programs and compensation to maintain environmental standards. Forcing agencies to compensate for a regulation that constitutes a "taking" out of their own budget will cause them to examine whether the benefit of the regulatory action is worth the compensation. This way, according to Adler, "land-use regulation will only be pursued when the benefits appear to justify the costs or when other options are impractical or more costly." The coercive regulatory system that is presently used by the federal government costs the taxpayers approximately $300,000 per wetland acre protected. Adler argues that incentive-based programs would conserve wetlands at a fraction of the cost and would protect private property rights. 3pp.  CONTACT: Competitive Enterprise Institute, 1001 Connecticut Avenue, N.W., Suite 1250, Washington, DC 20036, 202/331-1010, fax 202/488-0806.

<b>Key Issues in Environmental Risk Comparisons: Removing Distortions and Insuring Fairness, </b>by George M. Gray<p>
<i>Policy Study </i>No. 205, Reason Foundation<p>
Dr. George Gray, Deputy Director and Regulatory Toxicologist at the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis, maintains that environmental risk management is crucial in order to ensure that scarce public health resources are used wisely. Risk assessment plays a key role in environmental decisions such as setting drinking water standards, Superfund site cleanup goals, and standards for pesticide residues on food. The Reason Foundation claims that risk assessment is associated with nearly all of the two percent of Gross National Product that is spent annually in the United States on environmental protection. Gray argues that many of the standard risk assessments use to establish regulatory standards deliberately overstate people's exposure to environmental contaminants. To best employ risk assessment to protect people, risk characterization must be improved to make better use of science in order to find the most accurate estimates, not "conservative" estimates. All risk comparisons, concludes Gray, require the best science and risk assessment to maximize protection of human health. 18pp.  CONTACT: Reason Foundation, 3415 S.

<b>A Positive Agenda for Environmental Policy, </b>by Bruce Yandle<p>
<i>The Shape of Things </i>No. 6, Progress & Freedom Foundation<p>
Bruce Yandle, Alumni Professor of Economic and Legal Studies at Clemson University, delivered the remarks in this paper at a Progress & Freedom Foundation roundtable on the environment. Yandle begins by mentioning that it has been nearly a quarter century since the United States and most of the industrialized world have been engaged in a massive effort to maintain environmental quality. He argues that the current "command-and-control" system is obsolete and that U.S. environmental polices need to be changed. An agenda for change would involve the following elements: <i>Goal Orientation</i>, policy should emphasize measuring, monitoring and reporting on environmental policy; <i>Flexibility,</i> innovation should be rewarded instead of penalized; <i>Biological Envelopes</i>, organizations such as river-basin, water-shed and air-shed associations should be encouraged and allowed to innovate in order to achieve goals; <i>Community Common Sense</i>, environmental protection decision making should take place where outcomes and costs matter the most; <i>Common Law,</i> statutory blocks against common law solutions to environmental problems should be removed; and <i>Property Rights</i>, private parties should be justly compensated for public benefits that they are asked to provide. Yandle concludes by arguing that the U.S. needs to update the blueprints for America's environmental policy-which have changed very little in twenty-five years.  4pp. CONTACT. Richard F.

<b>The New Paradigm in Environmental Enforcement: Environmental Audit Privilege and Immunity Legislation,</b> by R. Kinnan Golemon and Laura D. Wolf<p>
<i>The State Factor </i>Vol. 22, No. 1, American Legislative Exchange Council<p>
This issue illustrates how self-audit environmental laws are beneficial to both industry and the environment. It debunks four myths about self-audit privileges, reveals the flaws in the Environmental Protection Agency's policies and philosophies regarding the laws, and provides an update of legislation in the states. The authors examine-and then dismiss-arguments against self-audit laws, deeming them unfounded. The conclusion they reach is that the pervasive and voluminous regulation that has evolved over the years is inferior to a "model that focuses on and encourages voluntary compliance." Such a policy would allow regulatory agencies "to direct their limited enforcement resources at those among the regulated community that do not strive to be good citizens." 13 pp. CONTACT: American Legislative Exchange Council, 910 17th Street, N.W., 5th floor, Washington, DC  20006, 202/466-3800, fax 202/466-3801.

Dennis Avery, Director of the Center for Global Food Issues, and Alex Avery, Research Associate at the Center for Global Food Issues, discuss the new urgency of global agricultural sustainability in light of population growth. They find that the primary challenge of future sustainability is conservation of forests and other wildlands and wild plant and animal species to ensure integrity of local ecosystems. They also find that ensuring adequate funding for agricultural research, as well as researching new ways to fight soil erosion around the world is a priority. Avery and Avery note that modern high yield farming practices improve their efficiency, safety and sensitivity to the environment in direct proportion to investment in new agricultural technology and research. 20pp.  CONTACT: Hudson Institute, Herman Kahn Center, P.O.

 <b>Marbury's Travail: Federalist Politics and William Marbury's Appointment as Justice of the Peace,</b> by David Forte<P>
<i>The Catholic University of America Law Review </i>Vol. 45, No. 2, The Columbus School of Law<p>
David Forte, Professor of Law at Cleveland State University, examines the Federalist politics behind William Marbury's appointment as Justice of the Peace in the last days of John Adam's presidency. Soon after his inauguration, Thomas Jefferson discovered the undelivered commisions of the previous president that included Marbury's, and immediately ordered them withheld. Forte shows how the ambition of Marbury, the son of an established, but impoverished, family, worked his way up to a position of power in the Maryland gentry. Marbury's political loyalty to the Adam's wing of the Federalist party in Maryland earned him a nomination as Justice of the Peace, "the most powerful office in the lives of the common people." Marbury's position amongst Adam's loyalists brought him Jefferson's enmity. It was Jefferson's refusal to allow Marbury to take office that lead to the landmark case <i>Marbury v. Madison</i>, that established judicial review, and sizably increased the power of the judicial branch of government. 53 pp. CONTACT: The Columbus School of Law, The Catholic University of America, 620 Michigan Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C., 202/319-5140.

<b>Gun Control: Is the Tide Turning, </b>by Austin Fulk<p>
<i>Organization Trends  </i>June 1996, Capital Research Center<p>
Austin Fulk, Research Associate at the Capital Research Center, examines the recent move in many states to allow individuals to carry loaded, concealed weapons. Fulk points out that as the federal government has been tightening gun control laws, anti-gun control organizations have been focusing their efforts at the state level. He points to approximately a dozen states where regulations regarding the carrying of concealed weapons have been relaxed. After debating the arguments against concealed weapons, and asserting that guns do not lead to increased violence, Fulk goes on to document the contributions of groups such as the National Rifle Association, Gun Owners of America, and the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms. Next, he traces the rise of the gun control movement, detailing the work of groups such as Handgun Control, Inc., Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, and the Violence Policy Center. Fulk concludes by noting that while the federal government may soon assist proponents of concealed weapons by passing legislation allowing concealed weapons holders to carry guns across state lines, that help is not critical. Just as education and welfare reforms have been devolving to state levels, so too, he claims, has the issue of gun control. 7pp.  CONTACT: Capital Research Center, 727 15th Street, N.W., 8th Floor, Washington, DC 20005, 202/393-2600, fax 202/393-2626.

<b>Handbook on Religious Liberty Around the World, </b>edited by Pedro C. Moreno<p>
Rutherford Institute<p>
Edited by Pedro Moreno, International Coordinator for The Rutherford Institute, the <i>Handbook on Religious Liberty</i> examines the historical and legal aspects of religious liberty around the world.  In John W. Whitehead's forward, he argues that a type of religious apartheid-the exclusion of religious belief and persons from the public sphere-is occurring throughout the world, even in the United States.  To support this thesis, Moreno provides detailed accounts of instances of religious persecution throughout the world.  Attacks against Christians, Jews, and a variety of others are documented from a wide array of countries, including India, Sudan, Israel, China, Kenya, Australia, and Thailand.  Given special attention are the instances of religious persecution in the United States, where, The Rutherford Institute argues, religious beliefs, particularly Christianity, are being systematically eradicated. Knowing where religious discrimination is occurring and taking action to stop it are critical, according to Rutherford because: 1) where religious apartheid exists, persecution of individual believers inevitably follows; and 2) with the rise of secularism, the positive restraining effects of Judeo-Christian beliefs upon citizens will end.  347pp.  CONTACT.

<b>Discrimination, Affirmative Action, and Freedom: Sorting Out the Issues,</b> by Roger Pilon<p>
<i>American University Law Review,</i> Vol. 45, February 1996 <p>
Roger Pilon, Director of the Cato Institute's Center for Constitutional Studies, analyses the current debate over affirmative action from the perspective of First Principles. Arguing that individual liberty is grounded in the idea of individual sovereignty, he demonstrates how the breakdown of the distinction between private and public has led to the confusion that surrounds the anti-discrimination/affirmative action debate among both liberals and conservatives, with liberals trying to impose affirmative action in both the public and private sectors, conservatives trying to impose anti-discrimination in both sectors. Neither side seems to appreciate how the ideas of private and public sovereignty would sort the issues out in the respective sectors.

<b>A Court Without a Compass, </b>by Roger Pilon<p>
<i>New York Law School Law Review </i>Vol. 40, No. 4<p>
Roger Pilon, Director of the Cato Institute's Center for Constitutional Studies, argues in a symposium on James F. Simon's <i>The Center Holds: The Power Struggle Inside the Rehnquist Court,</i> that Simon presents a one-dimensional morality play of the last 40 years of Supreme Court jurisprudence. Concluding, correctly, that the Reagan/Bush appointees have shifted the Court only slightly, Simon's analysis, according to Pilon, nonetheless misses the deeper currents in 20th century jurisprudence that help explain why the Rehnquist Court is as political as the Warren and Burger Courts were and why constitutional law today has become so politisized. The Court today, Pilon concludes, is without a compass because its members, reflecting those currents, have no deeply grounded philosophy of the Constitution.

<b>Emancipating School Prayer: How to Use the State Constitution to Beat the ACLU and the Supreme Court,</b> edited by Harry V. Jaffa<p>

Harry Jaffa, Professor Emeritus of Political Philosophy at Claremont McKenna College and a Distinguished Fellow at the Claremont Institute, argues that Congress has the constitutional authority to immediately pass legislation allowing voluntary prayer in schools. He adds that this prayer would be guided by the acknowledgment of God expressed in the preambles of 46 U.S. state constitutions. This would at once recall the idea of "liberty under God," and remind all Americans that acknowledging God has not been a danger to, but rather the formation of unparalleled freedom for two centuries. Further, he argues that a joint resolution of Congress would preclude the Supreme Court from acting in opposition without declaring all 46 state constitutions unconstitutional. 49pp.  CONTACT: The Claremont Institute, 250 West First Street, Suite 330, Claremont, CA 91711, 909/621-6825, fax 909/626-8724, E-mail <a href="mailto: 2026935@mcimail.com">2026935@mcimail.com,</a> Internet <a href=" http://www.claremont.org">	http://www.claremont.org. </a>

<i>Lecture</i> No. 567, The Heritage Foundation<p>
In this speech given at The Heritage Foundation's Resource Bank Annual Meeting, Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith puts forth ways in which Americans can liberate themselves for self-government. He begins his speech by discussing his experience as mayor and how he eschewed the public policy trends of the last thirty years of continuously raising taxes and establishing social programs and control mechanisms to solve the city's problems. As mayor, he has contracted out several city services, set up incentives for social workers to place welfare recipients in jobs, connected kids in tough neighborhodds to their local churches, fought for school choice, and overall, allowed flexibility and innovation in the delivery of public services. Goldsmith calls for devolution, but warns that it will not be successful unless it leads to a market-based system for providing government services. The system has to recognize that "the way to create true value is to let citizens and taxpayers make decisons that are in their own best interests." 5pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a>

<b>Initiative and Referendum in Pennsylvania,</b> by Charles E. Greenwalt II<p>
Commonwealth Foundation<p>
The process of "direct democracy," by way of initiatives and referendum, has fallen short of what reformers had in mind because of its extreme vulnerability to corruption. The question is, writes Charles Greenwalt, Senior Policy Associate at The Commonwealth Foundation, should Pennsylvania join the list of 24 states (and the District of Columbia) that have adopted procedures for statewide initiatives and the 25 states (and the District) that have adopted statewide referendum? Some of the major opposition relates to issues involving "finances," which would only allow those special interest groups with a good financial backing to get their issues on the ballot. Another problem the opposition raises is the belief of a 'complexity' of issues', which argues that the average or even slightly above average citizen would not really understand what he/she was voting on because the topics are too complex for their understanding. Proponents see this "direct" process as a must and point to the Pennsylvania Constitution, which says that the power and right to make laws ultimately rests with the citizentry. In addition, proponents of initiative and referendum believe that a higher voter turnout that develop and provide additional checks on lawmakers. Either way, concludes Greenwalt, what will work for one state may not work for another, thus each state must decide individually if the process of initiative and referendum outweighs the cost of corruption. 40pp.  CONTACT: The Commonwealth Foundation for Public Policy Alternatives, 3544 North Progress Avenue, Suite 101, Harrisburg, PA  17110, 717/671-1901, fax 717/671-1905.

Moreover, these amendments will restore to the Constitution the notion of a finite federal government, something that was implicit in the design of the government and understood by the Founders as an essential part of the system they created.

<p><li><b>Assembly Transformed: The Early Effects of Term Limits in Arkansas,</b> by Donald V. Weatherman,  <i>Term Limits Outlook Series</i> Vol. IV, No. 5. Donald Weatherman, Professor of Political Philosophy at Lyon College, examines the early effects of term limits in Arkansas. Term limits were upheld by the Arkansas Supreme Court in 1993. Since then, observes Weatherman, numerous changes have already occurred in both the seniority structure of the Assembly and the substance of legislation. Weatherman also reports that more "good government bills" have come to the floor than during any other recent session of the legislature. Weatherman concludes by writing that the new frontier of the term limits movement will be at the county government level, where elected officials are the most entrenched. 12pp. CONTACT: U.S. Term Limits, 1511 K Street, N.W., Suite 540, Washington, DC 20005, 800/733-6440, fax 202/393-6434.

<b>Rethinking Divorce,</b> by William A. Galston<p>
Center of the American Experience<p>
William A. Galston, Director of the Institute for Philosophy and Public Policy at the University of Maryland, surveys the ramification of divorce upon America's children, and calls for a reexamination of divorce laws in the United States. Galston holds that America currently tolerates a system that cares more for adults' interests than for children's.  Because of this, he argues, millions of children each year are being adversely affected by divorces-which the current legal and cultural environment permits. To remedy this, Galston states that Americans must first make it the country's goal to both reduce the number of divorces involving minor children, and, when such divorces are unavoidable, seek to mitigate their consequences for the children. Next, he recommends implementing social and legal changes to help couples before and during marriages, as well as at the threshold of divorce.  He also advocates eliminating the unilateral no-fault divorce system when there are children involved.  If divorce cannot be prevented, Galston advocates working to minimize the effects upon children by attempting to prevent diminished income, diminished parenting time, and the disruption of established ties. 5pp.  CONTACT: Center of the American Experiment, 1024 Plymouth Building, 12 South 6th Street, Minneapolis MN 55402, 612/338-3605, fax 612/338-3621.<p>

<b>Hollywood's Two Big Lies,</b> by Michael Medved<p>
<i>Declarations of Independence</i> Vol. 3, No. 1, Independence Institute<P>
Film critic Michael Medved condemns the Hollywood entertainment industry for what he calls their "two big lies:" 1) their claim that they present a realistic picture of the world; and 2) that they tailor their work to meet consumer demands. Taking on the first claim of Hollywood insiders, Medved critiques their portrayal of violence, sexuality, and religion. Next, he provides empirical evidence that more traditional, family-oriented entertainment fares better at the box office than more violent, sexually explicit fare which the industry claims the public wants. Medved asserts that people in Hollywood are not motivated by any desire to have their work mirror real life, or even make money. Their real desire, he claims, stems from a desire to win the approval of their peers for producing shocking and untraditional work. To combat this phenomena, Medved recommends that the American public should be more selective about the television programs and films they choose to watch. Their individual boycotts may not impact industry decisions, he writes, but it will impact their own lives. If they are not seeing the negative images of Hollywood, they can not be directly harmed by them.  5pp.  CONTACT: Independence Institute, 14142 Denver West Parkway, No. 101, Golden, CO  80401, 303/279-6536, fax 303/279-4176.

<b>On the Frontline of the Culture War: Recent Attacks on the Boy Scouts of America,</b> by William A. Donohue<p>
Claremont Institute<p>
William Donohue, President and CEO of the Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, examines the attack launched upon the American Boy Scouts by various groups charging them with discrimination.  Donohue begins his essay by first examining the principles upon which the organization was first founded.  Asserting that the Boy Scouts were intended to be a group dedicated to instructing young men on how to live moral, upright lives, he argues that the exclusion of atheists and homosexuals is in accordance with the group's mission.  Next, Donohue documents several recent court cases brought against the organization by various individuals in the homosexual, atheist, and feminist communities.  His next area of analysis focuses on the cultural war he feels the liberal establishment and members of the cultural elite have declared against the Boy Scouts.  Donohue then examines the role of the ACLU in the legal proceedings, arguing that an anti-family, anti-God bias permeates the legal association and is prompting it to promote  an agenda which seeks the exclusion of morality and tradition from the American landscape.  The essay concludes with an afterward by Edward J. Erler, Senior Fellow at the Claremont Institute, which recounts the recent court rulings pertaining to the Boy Scouts, most of which seem to favor the group's right to ascribe to its traditional moral code.  37pp.  CONTACT: The Claremont Institute, 250 West First Street, Suite 330, Claremont, CA 91711, 909/621-6825, fax 909/626-8724, e-mail <a href="mailto: 2026935@mcimail.com">2026935@mcimail.com,</a> Internet <a href="http://www.claremont.org"> http://www.claremont.org.</a><p>

<b>The New Majority: The "Leave Us Alone" Coalition,</b> by Grover G. Norquist<p>
<I>Imprimis</I> Vol. 25, No. 5, Hillsdale College<p>
 Grover Norquist, President of Americans for Tax Reform, asserts that America is currently in the midst of a historic political realignment.  This shift is occurring, Norquist writes, as traditional liberal coalitions break down, and a more conservative coalition forms.  He terms this new political coalition the "Leave Us Alone" coalition, describing its members as ordinary men and women motivated by their love for freedom, family and tradition, while sharing the common desire of being left alone by the government.  The opposition they face in their efforts to control the political landscape, Norquist calls the "Takings Coalition."  He claims that while for years this alliance has been made up of groups wanting the government to take money from other Americans and give it to them, they are now fighting amongst themselves, and their numbers are shrinking. With victory for the "Leave Us Alone" coalition in sight, Norquist outlines a four-step plan to insure their success. According to him, they must: 1) oppose any and all tax increases; 2) end the Left's sense of inevitable victory; 3) seize the moral high ground; and 4) defund the opposition. 5pp.  CONTACT: Hillsdale College, Hillsdale, MI 49242, 800/437-2268.

<b>The Intellectual Foundations of the Cultural Decline,</b> by Stephen B. Young<p>
Center of the American Experiment<p>
Stephen B. Young, member of the Board of Trustees at the Center of the American Experiment, argues that a powerful force has been eating away at the soul of American society in recent years.  This force he attributes to a line of political thought which holds personal license and moral relativism as superior to the American tradition of freedom and liberty under the rule of law. Intellectually, Young ascribes this philosophy to a French ethic originating in Rousseauian theory. The triumph of this ethic over that purported by English philosophers Bacon, Locke, Hume, and Smith and German writers Kant and Hegel, generated what Young terms "the deconstruction of traditional norms and ethics."  For the origins of its growing dominance in modern American thought, Young looks to the Vietnam war and the need of baby boomers to find a social philosophy that supported their opposition to the traditional claims of the American state. Young not only criticizes the prevalence of this ideology in American society in general, he also examines its specific impacts upon America's colleges and universities.  Its existence there, he charges, has made any true leadership or reform impossible. To solve this widespread problem, Young calls for society at large to demand greater accountability amongst themselves and within the university community.  15pp.  CONTACT: Center of the American Experiment, 1024 Plymouth Building, 12 South 6th Street, Minneapolis, MN  55402, 612/338-3605, fax 612/338-3621

<b>Public Policy Grantmaking: Four Women Donors Offer Their Views, </b>by Ethelmae Humphreys, Heather R. Higgins, Sue Anschutz Rodgers, and Kristin Avansino<p>
<I>Alternatives in Philanthropy </I>June 1996, Capital Research Center<p>
While women control approximately 60 percent of the nation's wealth and are gaining more and more prominence in the workforce, the Capital Research Center reports that women donors are less likely than men to support non-profit organizations promoting changes in public policy.  This issue of <I>Alternatives in Philanthropy</I> takes a look at four women serving at key positions at foundations who do contribute to institutions involved in public policy.  Ethelmae Humphreys, Chairman and President of the Humphreys Foundations, discusses her work to promote a free society, outlining the parameter her foundation has set for public policy recipients and her devotion to social issues.  Next Heather R. Higgins, Director of The Randolph Foundation, writes about the important benefits of contributing to public policy groups rather than just giving directly to charities.  Then, Sue Anschutz-Rodgers, President and Executive Director of The Anschutz Family Foundation, discusses how philanthropic donations to public policy best facilitate the interplay between business, government, and the non-profit sector.  Finally, Kristin A. Avansino, President and Executive Director of the E.L. Wiegand Foundation, relays how her foundation's respect for the sacred, democracy, free-market principles, and hard work have led them to award grants to public policy organization.  4pp.  CONTACT: Capital Research Center, 727 15th Street, N.W., 8th Floor, Washington, DC 20005, 202/393-2600, fax 202/393-2626.

<b>The Council on Foundations: The Era of Lady Bountiful Is Over Message to America</b><p>
<I>Foundation Watch </I>Vol. 1, No. 5, Capital Research Center<p>
From April 22nd through 24th in Atlanta, Georgia, the Council of Foundations held their annual meeting. The program, comprised mostly of liberal activists and philanthropists, did feature conservatives Father Richard Neauhaus, founder of the journal <I>First Things,</I> and John Von Kannon, Vice President at The Heritage Foundation.  According to the Capital Research Center, the convention was representative of modern philanthropy's obsession with appearances. More than one hundred awards were distributed for accomplishments in public relations, yet not one program was commended for delivering lives from welfare, helping drug users overcome their addictions, or helping the handicapped.  In other words, for their charitable contributions. Much of this arises, asserts Foundation Watch, from the Council's current President, Dorothy Ridings,  and her obsession with media relations.  But in the Council's focus on how people perceive their actions, they are forgetting to carry out their true mission, claims the article. Foundation Watch suggests that the Council reaffirm the centrality of service to the mission of philanthropy, recognizing where America's charitable institutions have gone wrong.  7pp.  CONTACT: Capital Research Center, 727 15th Street, N.W., 8th Floor, Washington, DC 20005, 202/393-2600, fax 202/393-2626.

<b>All the King's Horses and All the King's Men: What Would Charity Do Without Them?</b> by Leslie Lenkowsky<p>
<I>Philanthropy </I>Vol. IX, No. 3, Philanthropy Roundtable<p>
Leslie Lenkowsky, President of the Hudson Institute, examines the controversy in the philanthropic community over proposed changes in their relationship with the federal government.  He notes that while much of the American public supports philanthropic groups assuming greater responsibility for social work, those same groups fear the repercussions of losing government funds.  But Lenkowsky argues that partnership has actually harmed the work of philanthropies more than it has helped them. To support this, he points to the restrictions placed upon programs, and the realignment of priorities to match government demands.  Another problem arising from the mutual dependency of the federal government and philanthropies, according to Lenkowsky, has been that their goals and beliefs have merged, depriving the relationship of any diversity of thought, and along with that, any vitality.  Lenkowsky compares their relationship to a dysfunctional marriage that leaves both parties worse off.  To remedy these problems, he calls for a reexamination of their partnership that will lead to the formation of a new partnership, where government and philanthropic organizations maintain a greater degree of separation from each other. This, Lenkowsky believes, would facilitate a reordering of priorities, increased flexibility, and a reinvigorated private sector more capable of meeting society's needs.  6pp.  CONTACT: The Philanthropy Roundtable, 320 North Meridian Street, Indianapolis, IN  46204-1725, 317/639-6546.

<b>Liberalism and Community,</b> by Steven Kautz<p>
Social Philosophy & Policy Center<p>
Steven Kautz, Assistant Professor of Political Science at Emory University, defends the classical liberalism of Locke and Montesquieu, against its communitarian critics.  According to Kautz, communitarians have charged liberalism with being both morally and politically deficient.  He counters these arguments by first exploring the problem of community as it has evolved in recent years. Kautz then looks at the various disagreements which have taken place between Democrats and Republicans. The next component of Kautz's analysis centers on the arguments of three important, new communitarians: Richard Rorty, Michael Walzer, and Michael Sandel. Contrasting their views against more traditionally liberal philosophies, he discusses Walzer's account of moral reasoning, Barber's concept of the nature of republican community, and Cory's writings on the nature of the self. Kautz also addresses the issues of patriotism, self-government, and virtue, ultimately confronting the question of whether liberal reason can sustain the moral life of a community. Kautz concludes that it is the very liberalism which communitarians attack that has made the notion of community possible, that because of its tenets people can live together in a peaceful, prosperous and just society. 232pp.  CONTACT: Social Philosophy and Policy Center, Bowling Green University, Bowling Green, Ohio 43403-1088, 419/372-2536, fax 419/372-8738.

<b>The Communitarian Challenge to Liberalism,</b> edited by Ellen Frankel Paul, Fred Miller, Jr., and Jeffrey Paul<p>
Social Philosophy and Policy Center<p>
This book focuses on the debate over the protection of individual rights verses the importance of community interests.  The collection of essays included in this volume addresses questions such as whether individual rights should trump group rights, the role communities ought to play in shaping their members' values, and the extent to which government should promote community values. One series of essays deals with conflicts between liberal and communitarian doctrines on the nature of moral agency and the functions of good government. Another collection focuses on alternative ways to conceive of the two doctrines and challenges the basic assumptions about the harmful effects of capitalism on communities. Also explored in this volume are the basic questions of whether it is possible for any society to have one common good, whether culturally diverse states can ever become true communities, and whether participation in the community should be voluntary or mandated by the government. Contributing to this work, and coming from a variety of perspectives are: Neera K. Badhwar; Martha Nussbaum; John Haldane; Chandran Kukathas; Will Kymlicka; David Conway; Steven Kautz; Ronald Beiner; Cass R. Sunstein; George B. Fletcher; Stephen Macedo; Benjamin R.

<b>The Cost of Race and Gender Preferences in California Government Contracting,</b> by Tom McClintock<p>
<I>Briefings</I>, No. 1996-53, Claremont Institute<p>
Tom McClintock, Director of Economic and Regulatory Affairs at the Claremont Institute, argues that when arbitrary distinctions are made on factors such as race or gender, quantifiable costs are incurred. The author examines the financial costs associated with such policies, specifically with respect to California government. McClintock relates that affirmative action and racial preferences in California permeate many aspects of life, including education, and that federal requirements incur additional costs. The costs are divided six ways between private and public sectors costs and include costs to government from above market prices, caused by reduced competition, and opportunity costs associated with the application of resources below their highest and best use. 10pp. CONTACT: The Claremont Institute, 250 West First Street, Suite 330, Claremont, CA 91711, 909/621-6825, fax 909/626-8724, e-mail <a href="mailto: 2026935@mcimail.com">2026935@mcimail.com</a>, Internet <a href="http://www.claremont.org">http://www.claremont.org.</a>

<b>Still Choosing by Color,</b> by Michael Lynch<p>
<I>Briefings </I>No. 1996-53, Claremont Institute<p>
Michael Lynch, Public Policy Research Fellow at the Pacific Research Institute, looks at the recent report by the U.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights (OCR) on the admissions process at The University of California, Berkeley, calling the validity of their findings into question. For seven years, the OCR has been investigating whether race played an undue influence on admittance to the University. Recently, they concluded that the admissions policy does not discriminate on the basis of race. Lynch holds, however, that the, OCR's findings notwithstanding, race does play a major role in admissions at Berkeley. He charges that the OCR's report does not include even the most basic data on which it should have formed its conclusions (applicant pool versus admission data and SAT GPA data for the various admission categories and ethnic and racial groups). When this matrix of criteria is examined, according to Lynch, it reveals that white and Asian applicants were not given the same access to reviews and were seriously underrepresented  in acceptances when compared to their numbers in the applicant pools. Based upon the sheer empirical evidence, Lynch concludes that the admission policies of UC Berkeley would be found unconstitutional under the recent Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling in Cheryl Hopwood v. State of Texas.

<b>Virtuous Markets: The Market as School of the Virtues, </b>by Ian Maitland<p>
Center of the American Experiment<p>
Ian Maitland, Senior Fellow at the Center of the American Experiment, questions the assumption that the market destroys virtues such as honesty, loyalty and responsibility.  He asserts that proponents of that philosophy base their belief on the existence of a self-seeking, individualistic mindset which supposedly reigns there. This camp sees the market as both destroying the virtues within society and undermining the market's own moral foundations.  Maitland, however, takes a different point of view.  He argues that rather than undermining societal virtue, the market actually works to generate them. In order for businesses to function successfully, he asserts, they must be staffed by individuals who trust and are able to work with each other.  Trustworthiness, self-control, and sympathy are all virtues he claims the market requires and, because of that need, promotes.  Maitland concludes by calling into question the modern presumption that competition forms the basis of the market system, asserting that cooperation in fact is the most fundamental aspect.  11pp.  CONTACT: Center of the American Experiment, 1024 Plymouth Building, 12 South 6th Street, Minneapolis, MN  55402, 612/338-3605, fax 612/338-3621.

<b>Theft By Consent: The Lottery's Economic and Social Impact on Alabama,</b> by John Hill<p>
Alabama Family Alliance<p>
John Hill, Policy Analyst at the Alabama Family Alliance, looking at the case currently being made in Alabama in favor of a state lottery, assesses its probable impact on the state's economy.  Despite the promised benefits lottery advocates claim Alabama would reap, Hill finds that any good to come from such programs would be minimal, while the harm would be significant.  By comparing one proposed model to a similar program already in place in Georgia, Hill concludes that the lottery is essentially a voluntary, regressive tax.  The scholarship money lottery revenues provide in Georgia go mostly to upper and middle class students, according to Hill, while the funds from the ticket purchases come mostly from the state's poor. Next, he asserts that lottery sales have led to a decline in food sales equivalent to the revenue of lottery ticket sales, thereby negating any supposed benefit to retailers.  He also documents that the legalization of state sanctioned gambling such as lotteries have been shown to lead to increases in the rate of violent crime, gambling addictions, and, indirectly, instances of spousal abuse. Hill also points to the wide-spread illegal purchases of lottery tickets by teenagers, and notes that administering lottery programs has proven costly in other programs where administrative costs have risen faster than any other form of revenue collection. On the whole Hill, concludes that a state lottery would be an inefficient and costly way to raise state revenues. 25pp.  CONTACT:  Alabama Family Alliance, P.O.

<b><i>City Journal </i></b><br>
Summer 96, Manhattan Institute<p>
This issue of <i>City Journal</i> features an article by Contributing Editor Sol Stern entitled "The Invisible Miracle of Catholic Schools." Stern illustrates how inner-city Catholic schools in New York have educated some the neediest and uneducable kids from the city's most troubled neighborhoods, for a third of what taxpayers spend per pupil for the city's public schools. Despite the proven success of Catholic schools, Stern notes that liberals have ignored them in their search for solutions to the problems of New York's ailing public schools.

<b><i>Governing</i></b><br>
July 1996<p>

<b><i>Headway</i></b><br>
July 1996<p>
This issue of <i>Headway</i> features several articles on the issue of what is "authentically black." Joseph Brown, an Editorial Writer with the <i>Tampa Tribune,</i> tells about when his "blackness" was question when he came out on a different side of a policy issue than the civil rights establishment. Meanwhile, Sharon Brooks Hodge shares a story of when her "authenticity" as a black was questioned because she is "articulate." Ron Freeman, President of The Freedom Foundation in Summit, Missouri, argues that authentic blackness should mean being free and responsible to one's self and family, rather than shifting blame and avoiding responsibility. Finally, Jacqueline Gordon, founder and Director of the Christian Women's Forum, laments that too many African-Americans see black "authenticity" and "genuiness" linked to being politically liberal. These viewpoints show how broad generalizations about blacks are enforced within the black community itself and how this serves to work against the original ideals of the civil rights movement. 38 pp.  CONTACT: <i>Headway,</i> 13555 Bammel N.

<b><i>Carolina Journal</b></i><br>
April-May 1996, John Locke Foundation<p>
The April-May <i>Carolina Journal</i> centers on an articled entitled "Lemon and (Sub)Lime: Why We Must Re-engineer State Government." In this article, John Hood, President of the John Locke Foundation, compares state government to the U.S. auto industry to demonstrate the need for political leaders to take risks and be innovative. He finds that over the last 20 years the per-capita cost of state government in north Carolina and the price of a new car grew by about 70 percent in real terms. During the same period of time, however, the quality of these two products moved in separate directions. Concerning education and social services, increased state spending has not shown significant gains in education achievement and a key indicator in social well-being_the number of illegitimate births_has gotten worse. Meanwhile, during the same period of time, the struggling American automobile industry has dramatically improved and has reclaimed a competitive position in the world market. According to Hood, the comparison gives three lessons from the auto industry to state government: 1) competition is essential; 2) managerial flexibility is key; and 3) focus on results is crucial.

<b>CENTER  FOR INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS</b><p>
<b> CIR Wins Reversal in Fourth Circuit in Smith v VCU</b><p>

In <i>Smith, et al v. Fourth Commonwealth University,</i> CIR is representing five male professors at VCU who claimed sex discrimination when the school gave an en masse raise to female professors in 1992. On May 10, 1996 an en banc panel of the Fourth Circuit issued a decision reversing a district court's grant of summary judgment for the University. The opinion of the court obtained the support of six judges with three concurring and five dissenting.
<p>
The en banc decision rejected the VCU attempt to justify the raises with a regression analysis showing pay disparity between the genders. The court said that there was an issue of material fact whether some of the factors excluded from VCU's study_like performance, productivity and merit_ skewed the results and permitted a false finding of "gender disparity." In separate concurrences, Judge Wilkinson wrote that the "search for knowledge is too important to sacrifice to the spirit of separatism"; and Judge Luttig hailed the importance of merit and performance in salary decisions at VCU and declared the study performed there to be inadmissible evidence of a pay disparity.
<p>
<b>Texas Filed Petition for <i>Writ of Certiorari</i> in <i>Hopwood</i></b><p>
In <i>State of Texas, et al. v. Hopwood, et al.</i>, CIR and the firm of Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher represent Cheryl J. Hopwood and Douglas Wade Carvell, two white applicants to the University of Texas Law School who were denied admission despite credentials that would have led to their admission had they been African-American or Mexican-American. In March, the Fifth Circuit held that the school's use of racial preferences in student admissions was unconstitutional and ruled that the Law School could not continue to consider race in its admission process. On April 30, 1996, defendants filed Petition for <i>Writ of Certiorari </I> asking the United States Supreme Court to take the case.
<p>
Defendants provided no less than six separate questions for review. They argued, <i>inter alia</i>, that: 1) Justice Powell's view in <i>Regents of California v. Bakke</i> that "diversity" constituted a compelling state interest is the law of the land: 2) the law school was permitted to rely upon discrimination in some of Texas' public elementary and high schools in adopting a race-based admissions policy, despite clear statements in Supreme Court opinions to the contrary, and :3) Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is unconstitutional to the extent that it permits damage claims against states. The Clinton Administration filed an <i>amicus </I> brief on defendants' behalf agreeing with the first two contentions, and, indeed, going further to assert that the law school had a compelling interest in <i>racial diversity</i> (as opposed to the more limited notion of diversity in Justice Powell's <i>Bakke</I> opinion). Even the Clinton Administration, however, could not adopt defendants' argument that the Title VI is unconstitutional.
<p>
The plaintiffs-respondents Hopwood and Carvell filed papers in May in opposition to Texas' petition  refuting these and other even less-plausible arguments. On July 1, 1996 the Supreme Court denied the petition for <i>Certiorari.</i> The case now returns to the District court for the issue of damages.

<b>Developments in the Milwaukee School Choice Litigation:</b><p>
The Wisconsin Supreme Court denied the state's motion to reconsider its ruling dismissing its original jurisdiction over the litigation. That means IJ will be in Dane County Circuit Court. 
<p>
The chief judge of the Dane County Court denied the state's motion to substitute Judge Paul Higginbotham. The judge has a liberal reputation, but seems committed to a prompt resolution of the case. Contrary to press reports, Judge Higginbotham has never issued any substantive ruling in this case_the injunction was issued by the Wisconsin Supreme Court, and remains in effect pending a ruling by Judge Higginbotham.
<p>
Following these two rulings, IJ promptly filed a motion to dissolve the injunction and to schedule an evidentiary hearing. Although IJ asked the court to dissolve the injunction in its entirety, they asked the alternative that it dissolve the injunction as to nonsectarian schools, because only one of the remaining legal issues affects them.
<p>
<b><i>Black v. Village of Park Forest</i></b><p>
The Institute challenges a housing inspection ordinance in a southern Chicago suburb that allows local officials to conduct warrant-less, non-consensus inspections of single-family rental homes. On June 25, IJ filed briefs in support of cross-motions for summary judgment in the case. Briefs will be filed throughout the summer and a decision could come as early as September. The Institute represents tenants who reside in rental homes in Park Forest. The objective of the lawsuit is to establish that if government inspectors wish to enter rental homes, they must first ask for and receive a tenant's explicit consent. If tenants do not wish to grant inspectors access to their homes, the government must obtain a search warrant based on some reasonable belief (probable cause) that the housing code is being violated.
<p>
<b>Davis Bacon Act Challenge</b><p>
Representing four black construction contractors and three public housing organizations, the Institute for Justice amassed historical and economic research showing that the Davis-Bacon Act was originally intended to discriminate against black construction workers and that it is still having that effect today. The Institute has submitted six briefs and three large appendices. A decision could come anywhere between the next moth or sometime next year.
<p>
<b>New Jersey Welfare Case</b><p>
The Third Circuit heard oral arguments on June 10 in the appeal of the district court's decision upholding New Jersey's welfare reform program. The district court held that freezing welfare benefits and refusing to give additional benefits for additional children does not violate the rights of AFDC recipients. Legal Services of New Jersey, with the assistance of the ACLU and NOW, appealed the decision. Representing three New Jersey AFDC recipients and three public interest organizations, the Institute for Justice submitted briefs in the district court and the appeals court. IJ's briefs showed how the New Jersey case fits into a carefully-planned welfare rights agenda, orchestrated by Legal Services attorneys. A decision is expected in the next few months.
<p>
<b>Inter-racial Adoption Case</b>
<p>
<i>Matthew O. and Joseph I. v. Texas Dept. of Protective and Regulatory Services,</i> the Institute's attack on barriers to interracial adoptions, a state trial court recently denied class certification. Judge F. Scott McCown Found that Lou Ann and Scott Mullen, acting as next friends to the proposed class of minority children, cannot adequately represent the class because neither is Mexican or African American, while most of the class members are. Thus, the court found the Mullens "lack the identity of interest necessity."
<p>
The court further found that the Institute's argument that the use of race in adoption is unconstitutional_combined with its overall efforts challenging racial classifications and the regulatory welfare state_create a "very serious conflict of interest" with the proposed class. Such a conflict also precluded class certification.

Devils Tower Triumph_Climbers in Business</b><p>
A landmark challenge brought by users of Devils Tower in northeastern Wyoming has ensured that all may use the nation's first monument pending a trial. An order from Wyoming federal district court prevents the National Park Service (NPS) from closing the site for religious observances by a number of Native Americans. The Wyoming court granted MSLF's motion for a preliminary injunction to stop the NPS from closing Devils Tower to commercial climbing to conform their conduct in furtherance of those American Indians' religious necessities (which) amounts to "impermissible governmental entanglement with religion."
<p>
<b>Victory in Crooked Lake II</b><p>
Property owners on Crooked Lake in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan won a second victory when a federal district court ruled in their favor in another challenge to the attempt by the U.S. Forest Service to regulate private property due to its adjacency to a federal wilderness area. On May 16, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan barred the Forest Service from enforcing regulations denying MSLF clients motorboats access to Crooked Lake. The court agreed with MSLF on all counts, ruling: only Congress may use the Property Clause; only federal land was designated as part of the wilderness; private land could become part of the wilderness only with the consent of the owner; buffer zones could not be created around the wilderness; and wilderness designation is "subject to valid existing rights."
<p>
<b>Gasoline Tax: Unconstitutional?</b><p>
As the national debate heats up on the controversial fuel tax that was part of the 1993 Clinton tax package, MSLF has asked the Supreme Court to rule that the tax was unconstitutional on the day President Clinton signed it into law. MSLF believes the tax violates the Constitution's Origination Clause since it failed to originate in the U.S. House of Representatives. The lawsuit challenging the tax was filed by the Wyoming Trucking Association before federal district court in Wyoming where the court held that it had no jurisdiction to hear the case. The district court ruled that, by act of Congress, any challenge to a federal tax must first be heard by the Internal Revenue Service. On appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, the appellate court, while expressing concern as to whether the Origination Clause was violated, agreed with the district court that Congress had prohibited suits such as the one filed by the Wyoming Trucking Association.

<B>NEW ENGLAND LEGAL FOUNDATION<P>
Punitive Damages Case</b><p>
In a case that has generated much publicity, the U.S. Supreme Court has, for the first time ever, reversed a state court award of punitive damages on the grounds that the damages were so excessive as to offend constitutional due process. This case may induce lower courts to begin to rein in spiraling punitive awards which have made some state courts into virtual litigation lotteries.
<p>
<i>Gore v. BMW </i>was an Alabama case awarding $2 million in punitive damages to a doctor whose BMW was repainted without his knowledge before he bought it. The case was a paradigm of the absurdities that occur under the current system which allows juries virtually complete discretion to award punitive damages. NWLF's <i>amicus</i> brief, filed on behalf of the  New England Council, argued for constitutional guidelines to restrain such awards. This decision begins that process.
<p>
<b>Massachusetts Employment Case</b><p>
After Ms. O' Brien, who had no written employment contract with the company, was detected making anonymous calls to her supervisor, she was fired. She sued for breach of contract in Superior Court and in <i>O'Brien v. NYNEX</I> she won a total judgment of $500,000. That award included, in addition to a large breach of contract award against the company, $100,000 against her supervisor for his malicious interference with her employment.
<p>
NELF argued to the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court that the lower court had erred in finding that Ms. O'Brien could base a breach of contract action on the company's Personnel Manual. While the SJC did allow the contract action, it held, as NELF and NYNEX had argued, that if the Manual constituted a "contract," O'Brien had to follow all the rules in the contract including the grievance process. Since she never filed a grievance, the court held that she forfeited any "contract" right she may have had.
<p>
The court, however, did uphold the award against the supervisor personally. In a decision that may reflect the unusual facts of this case, the court held that a jury could find that the supervisor was so personally antagonistic to Ms. O'Brien that he forfeited future cases to ensure that this ruling does not create a loophole allowing fired employees to recover tort damages in employment cases. 
<p>
<b>Retroactive Property Tax Case</b>
<p>NELF will represent the Connecticut Business & Industry association in a Connecticut tax case involving Southern Connecticut Gas Company in which the primary issue is whether a town can reassess a taxpayer's listed property years after the tax was levied and paid.
Connecticut law requires owners of property to file an annual list of all real and personal property with the town in which the property is located. The town has a period to review the data and then it publishes a "Grand List" which includes all property in the town and its taxable values. In this case, a town seeking additional revenue reassessed the company's property years after the tax was paid.
<p>
Connecticut law permits the Grand List to be revised to include "omitted" property. The Superior Court rejected the town's effort to stretch that provision to cover a dispute over the property's value. If the town is successful, all Connecticut property owners will face a dramatically higher risk of retroactive property tax bills.
<p>
<b>NELF Fights Unemployment Compensation Award</b><p>
On behalf of Associated Industries of Massachusetts, NELF will file an <i>amicus</I> brief in the SJC in a Massachusetts unemployment compensation appeal which involves whether an employee who was fired knowingly violating a reasonable and uniformly enforced company policy can still receive unemployment compensation. The employee, a nursing aide, was fired for cursing an elderly patient in violation of a policy against verbal or physical patient abuse.
<p>
The Massachusetts Appeals Court reversed a lower court's denial of benefits, adding a "deliberate" glass to the statute. NGLF's brief will argue that that decision is legally wrong and would undermine laws and rules prohibiting patient and elderly abuse and, more generally, it would lower the already low threshold for receiving unemployment benefits, raising costs for Massachusetts employers and employees.
<p>
<b>Veteran's Tax Case Reaches End of the line</b><p>
After four years of litigation and a supporting brief from the U.S. Solicitor General, the U.S. Supreme Court has designed a petition for <i>certiorari </i>in NELF's effort to stop Massachusetts' policy of taxing federal military retirement benefits.

<B>NATIONAL RIGHT TO WORK LEGAL DEFENSE FOUNDATION, INC.<P>
Union Scheme Against New Employees</b><p>
National Right to Work Foundation attorneys have filed unfair labor practice charges with the Washington State Personnel Board on behalf of a Tocoma hospital employee after a state agency and its union concealed information from newly hired workers detailing their rights to cut off the use of compulsory union dues for politics.
<p>
Western State Hospital social worker Jennie Stephenson brought charges which describe how the Washington Department of Social and Health Services (DSHS) and the Washington Federation of State Employees (WFSE) union, in new employee orientation programs routinely withhold details on the limits of union-mandated forced-dues payments.
<p>
Foundation attorneys charge that the failure of an employer to provide such information violated regulations concerning employment relations.
<p>
In her charges, Ms. Stephenson seeks an order to restore the constitutional rights of workers by requiring that DSHS immediately begin informing new employees of their rights to withhold forced dues for politics. She also is asking for a refund of nonchargeable fees, plus interest, collected in the last six months, the removal of barriers to challenging forced-dues amounts, and the full disclosure of the right to withhold forced dues to all members of the bargaining unit.

<B>WASHINGTON LEGAL FOUNDATION<P>
<i>BMW v. Gore</i>: Punitive Damages</b><p>
In a major victory for civil justice reform, the Supreme Court ruled in a 5-4 opinion on May 20, 1996, that a $2 million punitive damage award for minor paint damage to a BMW automobile was "grossly excessive" under the Due Process Clause of the Constitution. The landmark decision came only a few weeks after president Clinton, at the insistence of plaintiffs' lawyers, vetoed a measure that would have placed limits on the award of punitive damages in product liability case. WLF argued that the $ 2 million punitive damages, 500 times the amount of the compensatory damages, was clearly excessive in light of BMW's good faith effort to comply with applicable disclosure laws and reasonable industry standards.
<p>
<b><i>Bennett v. Plenert</i>: Endangered Species Act</b><p>
On May 24, 1996, WLF filed a brief in U.S. Supreme Court supporting the rights of persons affected by federal decisions taken under the Endangered Species Act to sue under the citizen suit provision of the ESA in order to challenge those decisions. WLF's clients include Senator Dick Kempthorne of Idaho, Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Drinking Water, Fisheries and Wildlife, Representative Richard W. Pombo, Chairman of the Resources Committee Task Force on Endangered Species, and Representatives Bill Baker, Helen Chenoweth and Gerald Solomon and the Fairness to Land Owners Committee. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit had ruled that only environmentalists who wish to protect endangered species have standing to challenge agency decisions in court. WLF argued that businesses, ranchers, property owners and others who are directly affected by decisions under the ESA should also have a standing to challenge the excessiveness of agency decision making under the ESA.
<p>
<b><i>Habeas Corpus </i>Reform Measure</b><p>
WLF filed a brief in the U.S. Supreme Court on May 17, in this expedited case to hear a challenge to the recently enacted <i>habeas corpus</i> reform measure. A hearing in the case was held on June 3, 1996. The death row defendant in this case challenged the constitutionality of the new law enacted earlier this year that limits the ability of death row inmates to file second and successive <i>habeas corpus </i>petitions. The law has a "gatekeeper" provision that requires that such petitions be first approved by a three judge panel of the respective U.S. Court of Appeals and that decisions granting or denying the filing of the petition cannot be reviewed in the Supreme Court. The oral argument centered around the question of whether Congress could deprive the Supreme Court of original jurisdiction to hear <i>habeas corpus </i>petition filed with the High Court. The last time such a petition was granted was over 70 years ago.
<p>
<b><i>Arizonans for Official English v. Arizona</i>: Official English</b><p>
On May 24, 1996, WFL filed a brief in the Supreme Court supporting a provision in the Arizona Constitution that requires state employees to speak English while on the job. In its brief, WLF represented 34 Members of Congress, the State of Nebraska, and the Claremont Institute, and argued that the First Amendment rights of government employed are not infringed by a state law requiring that official business of the state be transacted in English. In this case, a government employee argued that the First Amendment protected her right to settle damage claims against the State of Arizona in Spanish rather than in English.

</FONT></B></CENTER>
<hr><P>
<font size=3> 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Once in a while, someone comes up with an idea everyone can agree on. Michigan's Mackinac Center for Public Policy has come up with a way for all Americans to know exactly how much their employers have to pay the government -- and for what -- in order to keep them on the payroll. It's called the Right to Know Payroll Form.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	If your employer adopted this form, your pay stub would show every bit of money the government takes from your pocket each payday. And why shouldn't you have this information? You're a taxpayer and the government is supposed to serve you, not the other way around. These costs affect you directly. Who can object to your knowing? 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The "Right to Know" pay stub would tell you how much your employer paid: 1) to administer federal, state and local taxes; 2) to comply with mandatory programs like the Americans with Disabilities Act, Family and Medical Leave Act, Equal Employment Opportunity Act, etc.; 3) for unemployment insurance; 4) for workers' compensation; 5) for the employer's share of Medicare; and 6) for the employer's share of Social Security. 
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Did you know all that was coming out of your paycheck? Well, we're not through, of course. We haven't mentioned the rest of the items that would appear on your pay stub: 1) withholding for federal income tax; 2) withholding for state income tax; 3) the employee's share of the Social Security tax; 4) the employee's share of the Medicare tax; 5) withholding for local income tax. 
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After all that is deducted from your earnings, you get to keep what's left. Just so you have some idea how your pay stub would look money-wise, take the example provided by the Mackinac Center, based on current tax rates. John Doe's two-week pay stub starts with an amount of $1,026.59, which represents the total amount his employer must put up to pay all the costs we mentioned, plus pay John Doe. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	After the first group of costs listed above are taken out -- in other words, the "hidden" money that vanishes before Mr. Doe sees a single penny, even on paper -- John is left with a gross of $916.67. 
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now, take special note: The way John Doe's pay stub now reads, he has the impression that $916.67 is his total cost to his employer. Yet, the "Right to Know" payroll stub tells a different story: that his employer already has paid $109.92 to the government just to employ Mr. Doe. Every two weeks. And the same is true for every employee.	Then, all the rest is taken out -- Social Security, income tax, etc. And what is John Doe left with out of a total $1,026.59? Just $686.67. Another way to put it: Before John could be paid $686.67, the government had to be paid $339.92. 
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Well, now. Doesn't that seem like a lot? It does to me. Don't you think that if all Americans could see in this kind of detail exactly how much of their money is being diverted to the government -- much of it before they even know about it -- they might have a few more questions about why the government needs that much money and what is being done with it? I do. In fact, I think every employer should give this sort of accounting to every employee. 
	<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And many in Michigan already have. The largest, and most notable, is the State of Michigan. That's right, all 60,000 State of Michigan employees will receive a list of what the state -- the taxpayers, really -- must pay for their Social Security and Medicare taxes. Although the state will not provide employees with the costs of workers' compensation or unemployment insurance, this is a great first step. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, the Right to Know Payroll Form is a great idea. Imagine a country where every employee knew how much government <I>really</I> cost him or her in the form of lost wages. I suppose this kind of "better-informed citizenry" would make a few people in liberal, big-government circles just a wee bit uncomfortable. After all, people suddenly would see the hand of big government dipping into their wallets every couple of weeks, whereas before it was done on the sly. But liberal discomfort has never bothered me before.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	And it doesn't bother me now.

<I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1079, The Heritage Foundation<p>
John Hillen, Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation, writes that, America will continue to squander its military resources on such inconclusive and tangential operations as Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia, if concrete guidelines for military intervention are not adopted. Hillen lists five criteria for military intervention: 1) it should defend national security interests; 2) it should not jeopardize the ability of the U.S. to meet more important security commitments; 3) it should strive to achieve military goals that are clearly defined, decisive, attainable, and sustainable; 4) it should enjoy congressional and public support; and 5) the armed forces must be allowed to create the conditions for success. Congress should also require, according to Hillen, that the National Security Strategy, an annual report by the President to Congress, contain: a prioritization of national interests and national security interests; a listing of criteria, such as those listed here, that will give guidelines for when, where, whether, and how the U.S. military should conduct military interventions; a set of criteria for deciding when and in what capacity the U.S. will participate in multilateral military operations through coalitions, alliances, and other structures; an unequivocal guarantee that the President will consult Congress before launching military interventions that are not national emergencies; and a declaration that U.S. military forces in interventions abroad will have clearly defined, decisive and attainable military objectives that can be achieved through proven military doctrine. 19 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto:Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<b>The Imperative of American Leadership: 
A Challenge to Neo-Isolationism, </b>
by Joshua Muravchik <p>
The American Enterprise Institute<p>
Joshua Muravchik, a Resident Scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, calls for an active, interventionist American post-cold war foreign policy. Muravchik argues that at times "America must be the policeman -- at others, the mediator, teacher, or benefactor." Only America, as the sole superpower, can provide leadership in upholding world peace. Muravchik uses the case of Bosnia to illustrate his argument. He asserts that Europe's and the United Nations' unimpressive response to the conflict in the former Yugoslavia revealed the decay of the United Nations and remains as the saddest example America leaving leadership to others. He claims that the current "great divide" over American foreign policy "is no longer between hawks and doves but between 'Washingtonians' (isolationists and so-called 'realists' who want above all to 'avoid entangling alliances') and 'Wilsonians' (activists prepared to spend treasure and even blood to defend world peace)." He also believes that America's domestic problems -- both economic and social -- arise more from weakness of character than from lack of money or presidential attention. He believes that addressing domestic problems and conducting an active foreign policy go hand in hand. 261 pp. CONTACT: American Enterprise Institute, 1150 17th Street, N.W., Washington, DC  20036, 202/862-5800, fax 202/862-7178.

<b>The World Bank and Economic Growth: 50 Years of Failure,</b> by <a href="/heritage/staff/johnson.htm">Bryan Johnson</a><p>
<a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/bg1082.html"><I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1082,</a> The Heritage Foundation<p>
Bryan Johnson, Policy Analyst at the Heritage Foundation, examines the unsuccessful efforts of the World Bank to promote economic growth in less developed countries. In light of President Clinton's recommendation that the United States give more money to institutions like the World Bank, Johnson shows that the Bank's approach to economic development has not worked. Concerning the World Bank, Johnson says Congress should: 1) phase out financial support for it; 2) seek a General Accounting Office audit of its lending practices; 3) make remaining funding contingent on public access to its records and information; and 4) require that the Administration provide Congress with a report on the level of economic freedom in World Bank recipient countries. Johnson provides a detailed history of the bank, and illustrates its failed policies. In his conclusion, Johnson points out that although the World Bank played an important role in getting Europe on its feet after World War II, it has drifted from its original mission to become little more than a clearinghouse for international welfare. 21 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<b>A Miasma of Corruption: The United Nations
at 50,</b> by Stefan Halper<p>
<I>Policy Analysis</I> No. 253, Cato Institute<p>
According to Stefan Halper, a former White House and State Department official, the United Nations' lack of accountability to its member-nations has led to corruption, mismanagement and a disconnect between costs and benefits. Halper presents a detailed analysis of mismanagement at the U.N., citing such evidence of corruption as: "secretive budget practices; an ever-growing army of irresponsible, unaccountable bureaucrats; and a massive duplication of effort." Overall, he calls for a comprehensive, independent audit of the United Nations, followed by drastic downsizing and reform, including privatization of many agencies. If such steps are not taken, Halper recommends the United States consider terminating U.N. membership. 24 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200, fax 202/842-3490, e-mail <a href="mailto: cato@cato.org">cato@cato.org</a>, Internet http://www.cato.org.

<b>Wages, Profits, and Income: Politics vs. Reality,</b> by <a href="/heritage/staff/wilson.htm">Mark Wilson</a><p>
<a href="/heritage/library/categories/theory/fyi97.html"><I>F.Y.I</I>. No. 97,</a> The Heritage Foundation<p>
Mark Wilson, The Rebecca Lukens Fellow in Labor Policy at the Heritage Foundation, examines the conventional American wisdom that says that wages are down, the middle class is shrinking, corporations are getting fat, and the rich are getting richer at the expense of the poor. Wilson shows conventional wisdom to be wrong. For example, while there has been a decline in average real cash wages since 1973, most workers are better off today because their real compensation and real per capita income continue to increase. He also shows that higher profits benefit workers, while falling profits limit compensation growth. Wilson, concludes that to the extent that real wages are falling for some workers, more government programs, restrictions on trade, and increasing the minimum wage will not bring a solution. Policies that focus on the primary problems -- high taxes and slow productivity growth -- need to be implemented. 11 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<b>Promise and Peril: Implementing a Regulatory Budget,</b> by Clyde Wayne Crews<p>
<I>Regulatory Reform Project,</I> Competitive Enterprise Institute<p>
Clyde Wayne Crews, Fellow in Regulatory Studies at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, illustrates how Americans live under a regime of "Regulation Without Representation," noting that much of today's regulatory rulemaking is done by agency bureaucrats not accountable to voters. He also points out that the amount of <I>non-tax</I> dollars government requires to be spent on regulation is equivalent to over one-third of the level of government spending. Crews proposes a "regulatory budget" that would enforce greater accountability by limiting the regulatory costs that agencies can impose on the private sector. Ideally, a full-scale budget paralleling the fiscal budget could be implemented. This would require Congress to divide a total budget among agencies. Crews argues that the real innovation of regulatory budgeting is its potential to make regulatory agencies feel the consequences of regulatory decision making, rather than the regulated parties alone. There are, however, some pitfalls to regulatory budgeting according to Crews. For example, under a budget, agencies have an incentive to underestimate compliance costs while regulated parties have the opposite incentive. Crews concludes that a regulatory budget is not a magic device that alone can reduce the current $647 billion cost of regulatory compliance. But, while burdens continue to increase and the benefits of regulation seems more ambiguous, it is necessary to make institutional changes that specify the purpose and reach of delegated regulatory power.  28 pp. CONTACT: Competitive Enterprise Institute, 1001 Connecticut avenue, N.W., Suite 1250, Washington, D.C., 20036, 202/331-1010, fax 202/331-0640.<p>

<b>Broken Promises: What's Gone Wrong with the Economy in the 1990's</b>, by Stephen Moore <p>
<I>IPI Policy Report</I> No. 136, The Institute for 
Policy Innovation<p>
Stephen Moore, IPI Research Fellow, examines the sluggish economic growth of recent years, illustrating the distinct and deliberate change in fiscal policy that has taken place under Presidents Bush and Clinton. Moore shows that compared to the supply-side fiscal policies of President Reagan, the tax-and-spend polices of the 1990's raised the overall tax burden by 1.25 percent of GDP, real federal non-defense spending rose by 30 percent, median family income has fallen by 5 percent (or $2,100 per household) and that tax hikes have failed to deliver the promised revenue. Moore concludes that if the tax-and-spend policies of Bush and Clinton continue, the 1990's will produce the largest budget deficits and the slowest economic growth rate of any decade in the past half century. 29 pp.  CONTACT: The Institute for Policy Innovation, 250 South Stemmons, Suite 306, Lewisville, TX 75057, 214/219-0811, fax 214/219-2625, e-mail <a href="mailto: ipi@I-link.net">ipi@i-link.net</a>, Internet http://www.ipi.org.

<b>Market Opening or Corporate Welfare?<br>
"Results-Oriented" Trade Policy Toward Japan,</b> by Scott Latham<p>
<I>Policy Analysis</I> No. 252, Cato Institute<p>
Under President Clinton, the United States has become progressively more protectionist in trade policy according to Scott Latham, an international trade consultant. He argues that in trade disputes with Japan over cars, semiconductors and photographic film, the Administration policy constitutes "corporate welfare in the international arena." The trade disputes, according to Latham, are a result of American firms' enlisting intervention in trade by the government to make up for their previous neglect of the Japanese market. These firms seek "bureaucrat-to-bureaucrat managed trade, not free trade." This study reveals the biggest beneficiaries of the Clinton Administration's protectionist trade policy toward Japan, and concludes that American charges of closed Japanese markets for the disputed products are groundless. Overall, according to Latham, results-based trade policy is not about opening markets, but instead about granting special favors to policitally powerful U.S. industries. 47 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200, fax 202/842-3490, e-mail <a href="mailto:cato@cato.org">cato@cato.org</a>, Internet http://www.cato.org.

<b>The Decline of the Nation-State in International Trade and Investment: Is the United States Losing Its Grip?</b> by William H. Lash, III<p>
<I>Policy Brief,</I> No. 168, Center for the 
Study of American Business<p>
William Lash, Adjunct Fellow at the Center for the Study of American Business, examines whether United States sovereignty and the concept of a nation state have been diminished with the expansion of trade agreements and the dominance of transnational corporations. He finds that the nation-state is alive and well in today's freer market place, as well as American sovereignty, arguing that what was widely perceived as a threat to U.S. sovereignty, the World Trade Organization (WTO), by law cannot usurp national sovereignty. Furthermore, 94 percent of U.S. investors have their portfolios limited to U.S. firms, while foreign investors still face many restrictions in the U.S. in industries such as nuclear energy, broadcasting, coastal and inland shipping, and domestic air transportation. Another reason nation states remain strong is cultural identity. Lash predicts that consumers and corporations clinging to cultural identity will fortify the notion of a nation-state and continue to support trade. Lash gives the examples of Canada excluding the U.S. operated Country Music Television and the EU restricting the import of non-European television programming and film. Efficiency, the concept that experts believed would lead to the demise of the nation-state by multilateralism, may not always be what the population desires, concludes Lash. 15 pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington University, Campus Box 1208, St. Louis, MO 63130-4899, 314/935-5630, fax 314/935-5688.

<b>Federal Estate and Gift Taxes: Are They Worth the Cost? </b><p>
The Center for the Study of Taxation<p>
This report was published by The Center for the Study of Taxation to illustrate the effect of estate and gift taxes on family businesses, federal revenues and the national economy. Many people presume that the estate tax will not affect them unless they have a large estate. However, a home, a modest investment portfolio, life insurance, retirement benefits, and/or business property can easily qualify as an estate in the taxable range. Ironically, the report notes that the tax does not even raise very much revenue for the federal government. The federal government spends the equivalent of 65 percent of the revenue raised by estate taxes just to enforce compliance with the tax. Overall, this report shows that estate and gift taxes cost people jobs by presenting a huge obstacle to business continuity and business growth as well as limiting the creation of new jobs and increasing the cost of capital accumulation. 16 pp. CONTACT: The Center for the Study of Taxation, 695 Town Center Drive, Suite 1460, Costa Mesa, CA 92626-1924, 714/641-8067, fax 714/641-3128.

<b>The Flat Tax and Small Business,</b> by Scott Moody<p>
<I>Issue Analysis,</I> No. 26, Citizens for a Sound Economy<p>
Scott Moody, Flat Tax Policy Analyst at Citizens for a Sound Economy, examines the effect of the proposed Shelby/Armey flat tax on small business. He finds that the flat tax simplifies the current income tax by dramatically downsizing the 600 different tax forms into just two, each the size of a postcard. This simplification would reduce the cost of complying with the current tax code for all businesses by 94 percent-from $150.6 billion per year to $9.4 billion a year. Moody also illustrates how small businesses bare a much higher compliance cost in relation to their total revenue than larger businesses The flat tax allows for higher capital spending by small businesses, and eliminates the double taxation that occurs when there is a capital gains tax. Investments in small businesses gain profits nearly exclusively as capital gains. So eliminating the capital gains tax would help small businesses immensely. 13 pp. CONTACT: Citizens for a Sound Economy, 1250 H Street, N.W., Suite 700, Washington, DC 20005-3908, 202/783-3870, fax 202/783-4687, Internet http://www.cse.org/cse.

<b>New Jersey Income Tax Cut Led to Savings, 
Not Rise in Local Taxes,</b> by Timothy Goodspeed and Peter Salins<p>
<I>Civic Report</I> No. 1, The Manhattan Institute<p>
Timothy Goodspeed, Professor of Economics at Hunter College, and Peter Salins, Professor of Urban Affairs and Planning at Hunter College and a Senior Fellow at the Manhanttan Institute, illustrate that Governor Whitman's income tax cut in New Jersey lead to savings in local taxes. They found that historically, "there has been little or no relationship between income tax rates, which have varied significantly, and property tax rates, which have increased consistently but moderately." In 1995, the first year of the Whitman tax cuts, there was virtually no change in real property taxes relative to 1994. Goodspeed and Salins also point to an economic phenomenon called "the flypaper" effect. The flypaper effect says that localities are more likely to spend lump sum grants from the state than they are to spend money raised by local revenues. This means, for example, that local school boards are more efficient with their funds when they have to answer directly to the local community. 10 pp. CONTACT: The Manhattan Institute, 52 Vanderbilt Avenue, New York, NY 10017, 212/599-7000, fax 212/599-3494. <p>

<b>What Medicare's Advisers are Telling Congress About Medicare Reform,</b> by <a href="/heritage/staff/moffit.htm">Robert Moffit</a><p>
<a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/fyi99.html"><I>F.Y.I.</I> No. 99,</a> The Heritage Foundation<p>
Robert Moffit, Deputy Director of Domestic Policy Studies at the Heritage Foundation, reports that the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission (PROPAC) and Physician Payment Review Commission (PPRC) have called on Congress and the President to slow the explosive growth in Medicare spending. PROPAC and PPRC are official panels that were established to advise Congress on Medicare reimbursement and physician payment reform. The panels gave Congress the following significant recommendations and opinions on general Medicare reform: 1) Medicare spending urgently needs to be controlled; 2) beneficiaries of Medicare need to be given more choices; 3) neither panel opposes Medical Savings Accounts; and 4) today's Medicare price controls cause limitations and heavy costs. Overall, Moffit concludes, the reports of these two commissions underscore the need for fundamental reform. 8 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org">Insider@heritage.org.</a><p>

<b>The Establishment Strikes Back: Medical Savings Accounts and Adverse Selection,</b> by Peter Ferrara<p>
<I>Briefing Paper</I> No. 26, The Cato Institute<p>
Peter Ferrara, Associate Policy Analyst at the Cato Institute, challenges the criticism directed toward Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) as a component of proposed structural reforms of Medicare. Critics of MSAs argue that they would appeal only to the healthy while traditional Medicare would be left to serve the sick. Ferrara, however, shows that recent studies that argue this point are seriously flawed. Based on actuarial studies and experience in the private sector, MSAs will appeal to a wide cross section of the elderly, regardless of their health status. Overall, Ferrara concludes that MSAs remain the best hope for reforming the Medicare system. 12 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200, fax 202/842-3490, E-mail <a href="mailt:cato@cato.org">cato@cato.org,</a>Internet http://www.cato.org.

<b>Perspectives on the Continuing Debate Over School Choice</b><p>
<I>Dialogue</I> No. 13, Pioneer Institute<p>
In the November 1995 issue of <I>Dialogue, "Responses to a Harvard Study on School Choice: Is It a Study at All?"</I> The Pioneer Institute gathered nine school choice experts to critique a draft manuscript of <I>Who Chooses, Who Loses? Culture, Institutions, and the Unequal Effects of School Choice,</I>edited by Harvard Professors Richard Elmore, Gary Orfield, and Bruce Fuller. Professor Fuller requested the opportunity to respond to Pioneer's critique. In this response, Fuller defends the impartiality of the research compiled by him and his colleagues. He also welcomes the stimulation to the debate that the Pioneer study contributes, but criticizes the fact that only advocates of school choice were invited for the critique. Fuller maintains that the empirical evidence shows that school choice is not the panacea that advocates proclaim. Terry Moe, Senior Fellow at the Hoover Institution and participant in the Pioneer critique, responds to Fuller's defense of his study. Moe points out that the Harvard study was not undertaken by impartial researchers either. Furthermore, the Harvard study is, in reality, not a real "study" as its authors proclaim. The Harvard report was merely a collection of separate papers presented at a conference and complied into one volume. Moe writes that on the brute facts, the Harvard report and the Pioneer critique do not differ too much. The difference is in the interpretation. The Harvard report is negative and Moe thinks that this is unjustified. 8 pp. CONTACT: Pioneer Institute for Public Policy Research, 85 Devonshire Street, 8th floor, Boston, MA 2109, 617/723-2277, fax 617/723-1880.

<b>The Decline of Academic Standards in California Public Education: The Story Behind the Student Testing Fiasco,</b> by Ben Boychuk<p>
<I>Briefings</I> No. 1996-49, The Claremont Institute<p>
Ben Boychuk, Research Associate at the Claremont Institute, examines the issue of educational standards and educational reform. The essential question, asks Boychuk, is: Would schools be improved by raising standards in the present system, or is a more fundamental overhaul needed? To answer this, he looks at the state of California and their well-documented attempts at education reform by raising standards. "Back-to-basics" reforms in the early eighties, which refocused on skills instruction, such as grammar, spelling, addition, and subtraction, brought slow but steady improvement in student exam score. Later in the 1980's, however, state education officials shifted their focus away from basic skills and implemented policies popular at teachers' colleges and among progressive education theorists. In 1987, these abstract educational theories were implemented on a much more ambitious scale with the result being that verbal and math SAT scores dropped dramatically. Boychuk  urges parents to stress a "basics-first" philosophy in their local schools and not to just ask for stated curriculum goals and academic standards. Parents should monitor homework and/or classroom assignments for academic as opposed to an "attitudes" focus. For, districts, he suggests a review of current standards for academic rigor, appropriate scope and sequence. Districts should also eschew teaching fads and require basic instruction in reading, grammar, composition, correct spelling, addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, fractions, and decimals. Finally, collective bargaining agreements with local teachers' unions should be re-examined to see if they interfere with curriculum reform efforts. 25 pp.  CONTACT: The Claremont Institute, 250 West First Street, Suite 330, Claremont, CA 91711, 909/621-6825, fax 909/626-8724, E-mail <a href="mailto: 2026935@mcimail.com"> 2026935@mcimail.com,</a> Internet http://www.claremont.org

<b>Superfund: The Shortcut that Failed,</b> by Richard L. Stroup<p>
<I>Policy Series</I> No. PS-5, Political Economy Research Center<p>
According to Richard Stroup, Senior Associate at PERC, Superfund, the federal program to clean up hazardous waste sites, was supposed to be a shortcut. The Environmental Protection Agency was given authority by Congress to clean up waste sites immediately and then bill the responsible parties. Stroup argues that Superfund has failed to achieve the desired results and that it should be scrapped. Superfund has replaced common-law procedures with nearly unchecked bureaucratic control. Overall, Stroup calls for Congress to allow both citizens who feel harmed (or at risk) and those accused of wrongdoing access to judicial review. This would curb the tendency by EPA, according to Stroup,  to create unsubstantiated and exaggerated fears in order to justify expensive cleanups. 28 pp. CONTACT: Political Economy Research Center, 502 S. 19th Avenue, Suite 211, Bozeman, MT  59715, 406/587-9591, fax 406/586-7555.

<b>Property Rights, Regulatory Takings, and Environmental Protection,</b> by Jonathan Adler<p>
Competitive Enterprise Institute<p>
Jonathan Adler, Director of Environmental Studies at The Competitive Enterprise Institute, challenges the notion that property rights undermine sound environmental conservation. Instead, he argues, they lie at its foundation. Under current environmental laws the federal government can, through regulation, take private land without just compensation. This directly contradicts the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The government pays the owner the value of his land when it takes the owner's property to create a publicly-desired resource, such as a military base, road, or wildlife preserve. However, when the government forces a property owner to alone bear a public burden on his land through regulation, the government rarely pays anything. For the last two decades, federal land-use control has been the most utilized way of achieving environmental objectives. Adler calls for Congress to ensure compensation for regulatory takings to restore Constitutionally guaranteed property rights and to lead toward the development of a new generation of environmental protection. Groups opposing compensation for regulatory takings argue that requiring compensation would impose an extreme financial burden upon the federal government. Adler argues that such claims are overstated and that requiring federal agencies to pay compensation would make them "more aware of the financial risks of over-relying on land-use regulation to achieve statutory goals." Other approaches, notes Adler such as incentive-based wetland conservation programs, present a possible way to achieve statutory goals on a far more cost-effective basis. Furthermore, forcing agencies to pay for the private property right they revoke through regulatory takings will encourage them to examine non-regulatory approaches to protecting the environment. Adler concludes that compensating landowners eliminates the negative environmental incentives created by the heavy hand of existing government regulations. 30 pp. CONTACT: Competitive Enterprise Institute, 1001 Connect

<b>Resolving the Tragedy of the Commons by Creating Private Property Rights in Wildlife,</b>
by Robert Smith<p>
Competitive Enterprise Institute's Center
for Private Conservation<p>
Robert Smith, Senior Environmental Scholar at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, argues that where human activity has contributed to species decline, the problem of overexplotation or overharvesting is a result of the resources being under public rather than private ownership. According to Smith, wherever there is public ownership one finds overuse, waste, and extinction. Private ownership, however, results in sustained-yield use and preservation. He uses the case of salmon to illustrate his point. Because no one owns the rights to salmon, each user of this common property resource is pitted against one another. This has lead to rapid depletion of the stock. Meanwhile, in some European countries, salmon fisheries are healthy because the rights to the salmon or the salmon rivers are privately owned. Game ranches, hunting preserves and safari parks also add support to the argument. Overexplotation and extinction of wildlife appears to stem from their treatment as a common property resource. The proper method for wildlife conservation, argues Smith, is creating private property rights. 24 pp. CONTACT: The Center for Private Conservation, Competitive Enterprise Institute, 1001 Connecticut Avenue, N.W., Suite 1250, Washington, DC 20036, 202/331-1010, fax 202/331-0640, e-mail <a href="mailto: cpc@cei.org">cpc@cei.org.</a>

John DiIulio, Professor of Politics and Public Affairs at Princeton, and George Mitchell, a member of the Governor's Task Force on Corrections, challenge arguments that American prisons are overflowing with low-level drug offenders and first-time non-violent criminals who can be safely released into the community. This study examined the portfolios of Wisconsin prisoners now serving sentences. This allowed DiIulio and Mitchell to trace the prisoner's criminal histories back to the juvenille justice system. They found that 91% of the inmates had current or prior conviction for a violent crime, the recidivism rate is approximately 90%, the majority had violated their probation or parole. The authors conclude that the people who really go to prison in Wisconsin are violent criminals and criminals with long records. 37 pp. CONTACT: Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, 3107 North Shepard Avenue, Milwaukee, WI  53211, 414/963-0600, fax 414/963-4230.

Kenneth Boehm, Chairman of the National Legal and Policy Center, calls for the abolishment of federal funding for the Legal Services Corporation (LSC). During the FY 1996 appropriations process, congressional leaders reduced a fraction of the funding for the LSC with a promise to end the federal subsidy by 1998. However, during the 1980s supporters and employees of LSC grantees fought efforts to reform federal subsidies to the Corporation. They mounted a massive lobbying campaign, financed in part by federal funds, and devised loopholes to avoid the few restrictions that eventually were imposed. With renewed pressure to reform in 1995, LSC fought back with strategies designed to ensure that their spending habits and politicized activities would continue-business as usual. Therefore, according to Boehm, it is imperative that Congress reaffirm its decision to phase out federal subsidies by 1998. 7 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail <a href="mailto: Insider@heritage.org"> Insider@heritage.org.</a>

The group issues papers that usually stress two points: 1) locking up criminals does not reduce crime; and 2) the criminal justice system is rigged against minorities. Instead of focusing on the finding of guilt and the appropriate punishment for criminal acts, TSP examines the sociology of the "root causes" of crime. Among the groups that TSP has great influence over are liberal judges, criminal defense attorneys, and law professors. Because their papers tend to blame criminal activity on the failures of society, their answer to crime is more government money for Social programs. TSP illustrates, according to the paper, why legislation should be passed preventing federal funds for groups to lobby for more federal funds.  4 pp. </ul>

<b>American Orphanages: How We Used to Care for Children,</b> by Marvin Olasky<p>

Marvin Olasky, Senior Fellow at the Progress & Freedom Foundation, presents a short history of the American orphanage. This research comes in light of the search for alternatives of failed welfare programs and alternatives to government as the cure for societal ills. Much of his findings contradict the conventional history of American orphanages that is filled with images of child abuse and neglect due to the absence of close government oversight. For the most part, Olasky finds that the accepted history of orphanages is biased towards accentuating the negative aspects while preventing us from seeing the positive role that they have played in the past. 6 pp. CONTACT: Capital Research Center, 727 15th Street, N.W., 8th Floor, Washington, DC 20005, 202/393-2600, fax 202/393-2626.

<h2>Legal Action</h2><p>





<b>CENTER  FOR INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS</b><p>
<b>CIR Sues Delaware State Bar Association</b><p>

CIR represents three white students who were rejected from the Louis L. Redding Fellowship Program for first year law students in the State of Delaware because of their race. The Redding Program is operated by the Delaware State Bar Association and provides internships for first year law students from across the nation who want to spend a summer in Delaware. Virtually every significant law firm, various corporations, the Legal Aid Society, the U.S. Attorney's Office, and various state officials in Delaware participate in the Program by contributing money and/or offering internships to successful applicants. Successful applicants spend half the summer at another sponsoring employer, and receive approximately $8000 for the summer. This upcoming summer will be the second year of operation for the Redding Program. To date, no white students have been chosen for the Program. CIR has sued the United States, the Department of Justice, Gregory M. Sleet (the U.S. Attorney for the District of Delaware), the Governor, Attorney General, and Secretary of Finance of the State of Delaware, and various private entities. The lawsuit commenced in early April.
<p>
<b>CIR Sues College for Discriminatory Hiring Practices</b><p>

Dr. Ronald L. Reisner, a white male, was employed as a part-time Adjunct Professor of Government at John Jay College from 1987 to 1993. During that time, Dr. Reisner, who holds a law degree from Rutgers University and a Ph.D. from Columbia, received excellent teaching evaluations from students and outstanding performance ratings from his faculty peers.
<p>
In 1993, John Jay advertised for a permanent tenure track faculty position in public administration. The hiring committee selected a black candidate as its first choice and Reisner, who is white, as its "alternate." When the committee's first choice candidate turned down the school's offer of employment, Provost Basil Wilson, citing an inadequate "affirmative action" search, decided to leave the position open rather than offer it to Reisner, who taught the classes on a temporary one year contract.
<p>
The following year, Reisner reapplied and was one of three finalists for the position, the other two being black males. It turned out that one of the other finalists did not meet the minimum qualifications for the position and the other withdrew his application after questions were raised about his credentials. Once again, John Jay decided to extend the candidate search for a third year. Soon thereafter, when the candidate who had withdrawn from consideration announced that he was available again, the Department of Public Management immediately hired him and the other black finalist as part-time adjuncts for the 1994-95 academic year. The firm of Stroock & Stroock & Lavan, and the Center for Individual Rights filed a discrimination suit on Dr. Reisner's behalf in September, 1995. Discovery is proceeding and trial is scheduled to begin in January, 1997.

<b>INSTITUTE FOR JUSTICE</b><P>
<B>Battle for Choice in Ohio: Round I</b><p>

On May 15, the Institute for Justice filed its opening brief in the Ohio trial court in support of the school choice plan enacted last year. IJ worked closely with the state attorney general's office and clients and allies in Cleveland to compile necessary data. The Institute also took the lead in coordinating <I>amicus</I> briefs in this case. The Center for Education Reform hired Mark Snyderman of Gibson, Dunn, & Crutcher to draft a brief that was joined by a substantial number of choice supporters. The final brief is due June 20, and oral argument is scheduled for June 24 in Columbus. The Institute is working with Hope for Cleveland's Children and Councilwoman Fannie Lewis to transport parents and children to Columbus for the argument.
<p>
<b>IJ Files Cert. Petition in <I>Immediato v. Rye Neck School District</I></b><p>
On May 15, the Institute -- on behalf of the Immediato family of Mamaroneck, New York -- filed a petition for <I>certiorari</I> with the U.S. Supreme Court in a challenge to a "mandatory volunteering" program for public high school students. Such programs require that students perform community service in the manner prescribed by school officials or they will not graduate.
<p>
The centerpiece of the petition is the issue of parental liberty. The Institute will ask the Court to affirm the right of parents to direct their children's education as fundamental under the Fourteenth Amendment, and to restore much needed balance between public school authority and parental rights. Ironically, the Friday before the filing, President Clinton in a major policy address urged all public middle and high schools to mandate volunteering as a condition of graduation.

<b>	NATIONAL RIGHT TO WORK LEGAL DEFENSE FOUNDATION</b><p>

<b>Union's Arbitration Scheme Violated Teachers' Rights</b><p>
 
National Right to Work Foundation attorneys recently announced a victory for employee rights as a federal appeals court refused to defer to a teacher's union "arbitration" scheme designed to deny Michigan educators their right to cut off the use of their compulsory union dues for politics. The ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit came in a challenge by Michigan educators to the Michigan Educators Association (MEA) and National Education Association (NEA) teacher unions. The decision struck down the unions' attempt to use internal "arbitration" proceedings to preclude judicial consideration of the educators' claims that the unions' forced-dues exactions violated their Constitutional rights.

<b>	NEW ENGLAND LEGAL FOUNDATION</B><P>

<B>NELF and NAM Help Win Health Care Case</B><P>
The U.S. Court of Appeals in New Orleans has ruled in favor of the New England Legal Foundation and the National Association of Manufacturers in the fight against laws that threaten businesses' power to control health costs. The case, <I>Cigna Heath Plan v. Louisiana,</I> involved Louisiana's "any willing provider" law which allows any doctor to join the staff of a health maintenance organization or a preferred provider organization.
<P>These laws, which are supported by doctors and other health care providers, eliminate the economies of scale which HMOs and PPOs use to control medical care costs. If HMOs and PPOs cannot guarantee a certain volume of patients, they cannot negotiate lower prices. In turn, those groups will be unable to set their rates as low as they otherwise could, and an important brake on the health care cost spiral will be lost.
<P>
The Louisiana law was challenged by Cigna, a major insurer which operates PPOs in that state. On behalf of NAM, NELF filed a brief arguing that the law is preempted by the federal ERISA law, which bars states from enacting laws which "relates to" employee benefit plans. Since almost all group health plans are provided by employers, the court agreed with NELF that ERISA applies and states cannot interfere.
<p>
<b>Massachusetts Capital Gains Controversy</b><p>
In 1994, the Massachusetts legislature enacted a major tax reform aimed at encouraging investors to hold onto capital assets longer by adopting a tax which declined depending upon the length of time they were held. That law was promptly challenged by a group supported by public employee unions which argued that the law violates a state constitutional provision which requires a uniform rate of taxation on income derived from the same "class of property."
<p>
NELF will represent Associated Industries of Massachusetts in supporting the law. The constitutional issue depends upon analysis of just what is being taxed upon the sale of a capital asset. Plaintiffs' simplistic position is that "sales are sales" and the length of time an asset was held does not change its "class." NELF, supported by economists and venture capitalists, will instead argue that what is being taxed on sale of a capital asset is the seller's personal exercise of discretion in choosing an asset and the time at which to sell it. Affidavits in this case show that in the real world of investments, assets with different holding periods are valued differently. The new law thus accords better with actual financial practice as well as providing a spur to longer-term, stable investments that benefit the state's economy and its people.

<p>
<b>THE RUTHERFORD INSTITUTE</b><p>
<b>Supreme Court to Hear Free Speech Case</b><p>
The Rutherford Institute has filed a "friend of the court" brief in a case before the Supreme Court dealing with the rights of pro-life protesters. The brief argues that the injunction against protesting in a "floating" bubble zone, which pro-lifers in <I>Schenk v. Pro-Choice Network of Western New York</I>  face, is an unconstitutional, prior restraint on free speech.
<p>
The injunction provides for a 15-foot floating bubble zone around clinic clients. If anyone in the zone objects to a pro-lifer speaking to them from outside the zone, they can ask pro-lifers to be silent-on pain of being held in contempt of court. Under this injunction, clinic escorts can demand that the pro-lifers not speak to the clients whether the clients desire it or not. The Supreme Court has previously upheld the concept of a bubble zone (see <I>Madsen</I>), but the "floating" bubble zone goes beyond what was permitted.

<b>SOUTHEASTERN LEGAL FOUNDATION</b><p>
<b>U.S. Supreme Court Appeal in Voting Rights Act Case on Course</b><p>
SLF's attempt to intervene on behalf of Georgia voters in the U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit against the State of Georgia, which was denied, gets another shot at judicial scrutiny-this time, from the U.S. Supreme Court. SLF Chairman Robert J. Proctor and General Counsel Henry D. Granberry, III, are preparing briefs on the critical legal question of intervenor status of voters in Voting Rights Act cases. SLF has argued that the State did not adequately represent the interests of Georgia voters in the lawsuit because the State was focused on defending specific voting district changes enacted by the legislature last year. SLF's potential intervenors include a sitting State Representative, a candidate for the State Senate, and a registered Georgia voter. Appeals under the Voting Rights Act are direct to the U.S. Supreme Court and therefore do not require application for <I>certiorari.</I>

<b>WASHINGTON LEGAL FOUNDATION</b>
<p>
<b>Deportation Supported in Fraud Case</b><p>
WLF filed an <I>amicus curiae</I> brief in the U.S. Supreme Court asking for the reversal of an appeals court decision that would require the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to overlook flagrant immigration fraud. In the case, <I>INS v. Yang,</I> the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that the INS cannot deport an alien based on the alien's fraudulent acts and misrepresentations, no matter how many or how long maintained, as long as the alien's motive for the misconduct is to enter and stay in this country. WLF argues that federal immigration law clearly gives the INS discretion to deport an alien for committing immigration fraud.
<p>
The case involves a Taiwanese couple who perpetrated a lengthy course of fraud beginning in 1978. The fraud was discovered by the INS during an investigation of immigration fraud committed by their children. In January of 1992, the INS issued the couple an order to show cause why they should not be deported. Overruling the Board of Immigration Appeals, the Ninth Circuit held that the INS could not consider the fraudulent acts. The court ruled that the INS had adopted a policy of forgiving an alien's "initial fraud" employed "to secure entry into the country" and that all of the subsequent fraudulent acts were "inextricably intertwined" with the initial fraud.
<p>
In its brief, WLF argues the statute involved commits the waiver of deportation to the agency's discretion. WLF further argues that even if Congress had not expressly committed the waiver of deportation to the agency's discretion, the Supreme Court's <I>Chevron</I> doctrine requires that INS's reasonable interpretation of the statute be given deference.
<p>
<b>FDA Chief David Kessler Refuses to Appear for Deposition</b><p>
David A. Kessler, Commissioner of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), refused to appear for questioning in response to a notice of deposition served by WLF in <I>Washington Legal Foundation v. Kessler</I>. The lawsuit challenges the constitutionality of FDA's restrictions on peer-reviewed journal articles, excerpts of medical textbooks, and other information about off-label uses distributed to doctors by pharmaceutical companies. FDA has maintained in the suit that it has no policy of restricting such materials. Documents obtained by WLF, however, indicate that the agency has threatened enforcement actions against firms that distributed such materials. WLF seeks to depose Commissioner Kessler to give the agency an opportunity to clarify its position with Kessler's own prior statements.
<p>
<b>Supreme Court Urged to Hear Property Rights Case</b><p>
In <I>Mock v. Pennsylvania Dept. of Environmental Resources,</I> WLF asked the Supreme Court to review a Pennsylvania state court decision holding that a land owner could not obtain compensation under the Fifth Amendment for a denial of a permit to fill "wetlands" for development. Conrad and Barbara Mock sought a permit to fill eight-tenths of an acre out of four acres of wetlands. The property, surrounded by a cement factory, a tire store, and other commercial development, was rendered valueless by the lower court decision. WLF argues that compensation is required under the Supreme Court's landmark 1992 decision in <I>Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Commission.</I>

<head><title>The States and The People: An Historic Coalition - Heritage</title></head>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><img src="/heritage/thf_log2.gif"><br><p>
<h3>May 1996 <i>Insider</i></h3>
<p>
<b><font size=4>The States and The People: An Historic Coalition</font></b></center>
<hr><p><font size=3>
I have just returned from the Nineteenth Annual Resource Bank Meeting in Chicago, April 25-26, and I am encouraged. Despite frustrating wheel-spinning in Washington, the conservative movement is not sitting around, grumbling, waiting for the political leadership to get its act together.  We are taking matters into our own hands through an amazing variety of nonprofit and grassroots adventures around the country.  We need this kind of responsible citizenship and creative self-government to put America back on track.  If the people will lead, the leaders will follow.<p>
As you may know, the Resource Bank -- the Heritage department responsible for publishing <i>The Insider</i> -- is Heritage's information clearinghouse, strategy forum, and coalition builder for leading policy groups, scholars, and activists.  At this year's annual meeting, entitled "The States and The People: Setting the Agenda for Devolution," 290 conservative leaders, representing 180 national think tanks, state think tanks, public interest legal groups, grassroots and pro-family groups, ministries and volunteer service organizations, academic institutions, corporations and business groups, and state and local government offices, assembled to discuss methods for returning federally usurped powers to the states and the people.<p>
	At 1995's Resource Bank meeting, entitled "A Time for Leading," we celebrated an exciting new political environment where ideas thought unrealistic just months before were being discussed as serious options.  Bob Dole had called for the abolition of four federal agencies, the flat tax was miraculously on the table, Joycelyn Elders had been run out of office, and Mario Cuomo and Ann Richards were selling Doritos corn chips. <p> 
	Well, no one said it would be easy, but, in retrospect, perhaps the conservative movement was a bit overly optimistic.  We may have turned the corner in our fight against liberalism, but we have a long way to go. We do have new intellectual ammunition at our disposal, though.  The emergence of the idea of devolution, of returning powers to the states and the people, presents the conservative movement a great opportunity to go on the offensive against big centralized government. <p>
The concept of devolution, and the related concepts of federalism, subsidiarity, and decentralization, have long been standards in the pantheon of conservative principles.  But when federalism and devolution recently re-emerged in the national policy debate -- initially in the context of unfunded federal  mandates -- conservatives were not yet ready with a lot of practical ideas to exploit the opportunity.  Moreover, as Heritage's welfare analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/rector.htm">Robert Rector</a> points out, there is "federalism," and then there is "federalism."  Having the federal government collect taxes and hand them over to ultra-liberal state welfare agencies without a few, principled, conservative "strings" is not true federalism.<p>
The purpose of this year's Resource Bank meeting, then, was to help set the conservative agenda for devolution -- devolution from the federal government to the states, from state governments to local governments, and from all spheres of government to the people.  We plan to publish proceedings of the conference.  Watch <i>The Insider</i> for the announcement.<p>
I cannot do justice in this space to all the marvelous speakers, but here is a sample.  Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith spoke of the challenges he has faced in reforming entrenched bureaucracy whose highest priority is its own survival.  Virginia Secretary of Natural Resources Becky Norton Dunlop described how Virginia fought EPA dictates concerning emission testing systems, proving that states <i>can</i> successfully resist federal micromanagement.  California Director of Social Services Eloise Anderson recounted her struggles to fashion a welfare system that promotes individual self-sufficiency in family and community, rather than dependency on the morally bankrupt welfare state.  Activist Susan Mitchell described how she and other Wisconsin school choice advocates led a diverse coalition in a sophisticated campaign to devolve control over education to parents and communities.  Kids Hope USA Executive Director Virgil Gulker spoke movingly of his work leading individual believers in evangelical churches to minister personally to at-risk kids. National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship President Steve Mariotti outlined his program's success at launching inner-city children on enterpreneurial careers, by teaching them how to start and run their own businesses.<p>
These are the people and programs that will make devolution happen.  State-friendly partners in the federal government are necessary allies, but we will be waiting a long time for Washington to decentralize itself.  The Enumerated Powers and Tenth Amendment Enforcement Acts currently before Congress, for example, will have much better chances for passage if our friends in Congress hear from the heartland. Indeed, true devolution, true federalism, a truly free and responsible society will not occur unless we the people and the states demand it, step up to our own responsibilities, and lead the way.
It was, after all, the people and the states who authorized the federal government, not the other way around.  Moreover, the federal leviathan grew not only as a result of federal usurpation but also as a result of abdication by the states and the people -- in exchange for phantom perks and promises. If the new citizenship movement is any sign, perhaps Americans are finally learning -- the hard way --  that every time we abdicate a little piece of responsibility that is rightfully ours, we lose a little piece of freedom too.<p>
	It will take an historic coalition, The States and The People, to return America to her constitutional principles of federalism, limited government, and accountability in government. "The states" and "the people" are the two parties to whom the Tenth Amendment reserves the "powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution." It is up to us to rein in government.  We have our work cut out for usand worthy work it is.

<p><font size=3>
Edwin J. Feulner, Jr., President of The Heritage Foundation, outlines a conservative internationalist foreign policy that is anchored in the foundation of vital American interests. In his introduction, Dr. Feulner defines those vital interests as developments that could concretely affect the security or economic future of America and its citizens immediately. Feulner discusses specific failures of President Clinton's interventionist strategy and points out that humanitarian interventions and other experiments have diverted attention from key items on the American foreign policy agenda, including: bilateral relations with Russia; China and its increasing hostility in East Asia; Iran, which has engaged in clandestine nuclear efforts as well as terrorism exportation; NATO, whose future has become entangled with Bosnia; missile defense, which has been dismissed as unnecessary by the administration; and the promotion of free trade, most notably the failure to expand NAFTA to include Chile. Overall, Feulner argues that when America's vital interests are served, so are the values of political and economic freedom worldwide. He lists the following as America's most vital interests: 1) safeguarding U.S. national security; 2) preventing a major power threat to Europe, East Asia, and the Persian Gulf; 3) maintaining access to foreign trade; 4) protecting Americans against threats to their lives and well-being; and 5) maintaining access to resources. 8 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.

Baker Spring, Senior Defense Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation, surveys the decades-long effort to ban chemical weapons in anticipation of an extensive chemical weapons convention soon to be considered by the world powers. He argues that in order for any convention to deserve the support of the Senate, the agreement, as with all other arms control agreement, must pass a five part test: 1) will the convention reduce the risk of war?; 2) are the convention's requirements consistent with America's global responsibilities?; 3) is the convention adequately verifiable?; 4) are the provisions of the convention enforceable?; and 5) does the convention enhance U.S. national security? Spring lays out three principles for effective counter-proliferation of chemical weapons, including the need to deter a chemical attack,  the need for defenses against chemical weapons, and the need for offensive capabilities. 11 pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.

<p><font size=3>
Jonathan Clarke, Research Fellow in Foreign Policy Studies at the Cato Institute, argues that the Administration's failure to address vital interests has created a vacuum in U.S. foreign policy. He writes that while the Administration has strived to change conditions in Haiti, Ulster and Bosnia, it has ignored enhancing relations with Russia, China, Western Europe, and Japan. The recent bombings by the Irish Republican Army and Hamas, according to Clarke, have proven the instability of the peace that the administration claims to have secured in the respective regions of Northern Ireland and the Middle East. And even if the administration's claims are accepted at face value, continues Clarke, regions such as Bosnia, Northern Ireland and Haiti have little relevance to America's vital interests. Interests that include relations with crucial nations such as Russia, China, Japan, and the West European powers and are in disarray. Clarke concludes by writing that the vacuum created by ignoring what should be the epicenter of foreign policy cannot be compensated by miscellaneous policy successes on peripheral foreign policy matters. 17 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200, fax 202/842-3490, <a href="mailto:cato@cato.org">E-mail cato@cato.org</a>, Internet

The International Republican Institute sponsored a 22-member delegation to observe Russia's State Duma elections held December 17, 1995. This report relays the findings and observations of the delegation and their recommendations for future improvement in Russia's electoral process. First, they recommend that the secret ballot be practiced even though open voting (voting outside of the booth) is customary for Russians. In general, they recommend that the counting process become more secure. Counters should be better trained and tabulation process should be better organized to close opportunities for vote manipulation. Finally, the military involvement at some voting sites had the potential to create military influence over voting. The report also contains a survey of the major political parties, delegate observations on electoral environment and administration, delegate reports from the 10 cities monitored, exit poll results, and lists of new State Duma deputies. 121 pp.  CONTACT: International Republican Institute, Suite 900, 1212 New York Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20005-3987, 202/408-9450, fax 202/408-9462, <a href="mailto:IRI@access.digex.net">e-mail IRI@access.digex.net</a>.

Is There a "Clinton Crunch"?: How the 1993 Budget Plan Affected the Economy</a>,

<p><font size=3>
This recent paper, by Heritage analysts William Beach, Scott Hodge, John Barry, Joe Cobb, and Mark Wilson, helps show why there is widespread dissatifaction among Americans about the nation's economic performance, despite relatively good economic figures such as low interest rates, inflation and unemployment. Using the Washington University Macro Model (WUMM)-a major economic model of the U.S. economy also used by the federal government and many Fortune 500 companies-economists at the Heritage Foundation investigated how the economy would likely be performing today had Congress not raised taxes in 1993 as the nation was coming out of the 1990-1991 recession. According to their analysis, the 1993 tax hike, supported by the President, did produce what has come to be known as the "Clinton Crunch." The "Clinton Crunch" is the economic situation in which there is a larger tax bill for families combined with a stagnation in incomes and an economy that is performing well below its potential. They found that the 1993 Budget had the following effects on the U.S. economy: 1) economic growth has been slowed by $208 billion; 2) the pace of business formation has been slowed by over 40,000 new businesses; 3) job growth has been slowed by 1.2 million jobs; 4) the growth in household income and savings has been cut; and 5) the reduction in the deficit attributable to the 1993 plan has been small. Removing the effect of the 1993 budget, using WUMM, shows that the economy would have been performing significantly better today had the legislation not been enacted. 23 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.

In his introduction, Lawrence Reed, President of the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, praises the retreat of statism in American public policy. However, he points out the ravages of its influence are still with us: "bloated, overbearing bureaucracies; crushing tax burdens; deficits and debt swallowing huge chunks of public budgets." Reed argues that privatization is the cure for public sector waste, fraud and inefficiency. With a foreword by Michigan Governor John Engler, this collection of twenty-six  essays supporting privatization includes contributions from: Hans Sennholz, President of The Foundation for Economic Education; Doug Bandow, Senior Fellow at the Cato Institute; Burton Folsom, Senior Fellow at the Mackinac Center; Clint Bolick, Director of Litigation at the Institute for Justice; and several other authors. The essays are grouped into six sections; 1) the privatizing idea; 2) downsizing the federal bureaucracy; 3) transportation and highways; 4) private property and environmentalism; 5) rethinking "public" services; and 6) the challenge ahead.  202 pp. CONTACT: The Foundation for Economic Education, 30 South Broadway, Irvington-on-Hudson, NY  10533, 914/591-7230, fax 914/591-8910.

This issue centers on the topic of privatization. In the first article, Editor Kerry Jackson illustrates how several states have implemented privatization programs. Some of the most notable include: the proposed privatization of the new international arrival building and the cargo facilities at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York; the privatization of state daycare centers and some Department of Motor Vehicle functions in New Jersey; and the outsourcing of student loan processing operations in Indiana. Jackson also reports on how New Zealand used privatization to return from the brink of economic collapse and the success of prison privatization efforts in Texas. In another article the Reason Foundation puts forth a case for governments to sell off underutilized assets to offset budgetary shortfalls. 7 pp. CONTACT: American Legislative Exchange Council, 910 17th Street, N.W., 5th Floor, Washington, DC  20006, 202/466-3800, fax 202/466-3801.

Vague and complicated prevailing wage laws are important to potential government contractors because they effect who will bid on government contracts and how competitive those contracts will be. Greg Smith, Task Force Director at the American Legislative Exchange Council, explains that prevailing wage laws require government contractors to pay minimal administratively determined wages and fringe benefits to employees working on public works projects. Moreover, Smith writes that the U.S Department of Labor determines the wage on the federal level in a way that usually reflects union wages and benefits rather than market rate. State prevailing wage laws are modeled after the federal law which was enacted with the Davis-Bacon Act of 1931. Davis-Bacon was passed in order to exclude black and immigrant workers from providing cheaper labor in the place of higher paying white union labor. 5 pp. CONTACT: American Legislative Exchange Council, 910 17th Street, N.W., 5th floor, Washington, DC  20006, 202/466-3800, fax 202/466-3801.

Heritage Policy Analyst Bryan Johnson presents and then disproves the major myths concerning free trade expansion. Myth #1: Free trade has destroyed America's manufacturing base. Myth #2: High manufacturing wages must be protected from foreign competition regardless of the cost to the overall economy. Myth #3: Free trade is causing America to lose its technological edge. Myth #4: Trade deficits are harmful while trade surpluses are beneficial. Myth #5: Trade deficits cost jobs. Myth #6: Japan's prosperity is based on trade surpluses generated by managed trade policies. Myth #7: American companies will go bankrupt unless the U.S. government limits import competition and forces foreign countries to purchase more U.S. goods. Myth #8: Countries like Japan are called protectionist simply because the U.S. has experienced difficulty penetrating their markets. Myth #9: Trade surpluses are always the result of government policy. Myth #10: Trade retaliation is the most effective way to open foreign markets. And Myth #11: International trade arrangements like the World Trade Organization and the North American Free Trade Area violate American sovereignty. 11 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.<br>

Daniel Mitchell, McKenna Senior Fellow in Political Economy at The Heritage Foundation, illustrates the ins and outs of the flat tax. He begins by explaining what the flat tax is, then moves on to discuss its advantages. Mitchell also provides an easy model from which the reader may calculate their tax bill and then illustrates how today's tax system is anti-growth and anti-family. A state-by-state summary of a flat tax's potential impact is included, which shows how the flat tax would renew the American job creation machine and help homeowners-despite the warnings of skeptics. Mitchell also illustrates how a flat tax would positively control the deficit, how it would help seniors, and how it would save social security. He concedes in his conclusion that the one question that the book does not answer about the flat tax is how it will be achieved. The reader is reminded of how much power politicians wield as a result of their ability to tinker with the tax code to benefit special interests. The book includes a preface by Jack Kemp and an introduction by Senator Richard Shelby. 60 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.

This line-by-line analysis of Michigan's 1995-96 state budget reflects a principled vision for Michigan culture, according to the authors, by asking this question about each budget item: Should this program or activity be done by the authority of the state and financed by taxation, or should it be done by its individual citizens acting in voluntary cooperation and private contract with one another? The study recommends over $2 billion in spending reductions (over 7% of the state budget) achieved by eliminating unnecessary and counterproductive programs, rolling back unjustified program growth, and contracting out for services that can be handled more efficiently by the private sector.  97 pp. CONTACT: The Mackinac Center for Public Policy, 119 Ashman St., P.O.

The new Congress took charge in January of 1995 and promised to close and consolidate redundant and obsolete government agencies. Ronald Utt, Visiting Fellow at the Heritage Foundation, examines the progress that has been made on these promises. Overall, he finds that in a sharp contrast to past years, Congress actually followed through on its promises and achieved more than expected. They shut down 270 agencies, divisions, offices, and programs throughout the federal government. Utt points out that while Congress has done its part to reduce government waste, only about $600 million of the $5.8 billion in potential savings has been signed into law by the President. He concludes that it is obvious that tremendous progress has been made in cutting wasteful, obsolete, and redundant federal programs, however, he urges that Congress and the President revisit many of the independent agencies that survived and make additional cuts as appropriate.  20 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.<br>

<b><font size=3>The Decline of Welfare in Wisconsin, <br></font></b>

<i><font size=3>Report</font></i><font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman"> 
Vol. 9, No. 3, Wisconsin Policy Research Institute</font>
<p><font size=3>
Lawrence Mead, Visiting Professor in Public Policy at Princeton, examines the decline of welfare in Wisconsin. Between 1987, when Governor Tommy Thompson came into office, and 1994, the state of Wisconsin cut its welfare rolls (Aid to Families with Dependent Children, or AFDC) by 23 percent, much more than any other state. Liberals claim the drop in the caseload has to do with Wisconsin's thriving economy, not necessarily the efforts by the Thompson administration to reform welfare. Mead's paper shows otherwise. He says that the economy played a part, but that it was the welfare reforms, especially the implementation of the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training Program (JOBS) that greatly influenced the shrinking of Wisconsin's welfare rolls. On the issue of whether the state has gained or lost money on welfare reform, Mead shows that although it has spent much more on administration and support services than before, due to the drop in the caseload, Wisconsin has saved an estimated $68 million overall.  44 pp. CONTACT: Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, 3107 North Shepard Avenue, Milwaukee, WI 53221, 414/963-0600, fax 414/963-4230.

Genevieve Young, a Washington, D.C. attorney, illustrates how advocates for government-controlled health care have reformulated their strategy by sneaking their agenda through state capitals and into schoolhouses. She reports on a recent investigation sponsored by the Pennsylvania General Assembly to see how the state's public school system was being used to provide health programs for students and their families. The investigation found that several district's school based-health clinics were already providing extensive health services. The Pennsylvania General Assembly had no previous knowledge of, nor had it given consent to, the establishment and funding of such services. Young shows that legislatures are also discovering that programs and proposals that claim to be intended for America's children actually represent a renewed assault on private health care. Further investigation into the issue has revealed that state education reform programs have become the road to health reform, and that state agencies and private foundations have been the forces behind enacting Clinton Administration health care proposals through a back door. Young calls for Congress and legislatures to re-examine how children have become pawns in political struggles over power and money, and how healthcare reform, defeated in Congress, is being implemented under the guise of "education reform." 7 pp.  CONTACT: Capital Research Center, 727 15th Street, N.W., 8th Floor, Washington, DC 20005, 202/393-2600, fax 202/393-2626.

According to this paper, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in its current form is inefficient and a "prototypical centralized, bureaucratic regulatory agency." Furthermore, the most significant cost of FDA's inefficiency is human, as America's outmoded medical regulatory process directly results in jobs being exported abroad and denies new medical technology to patients that need them much sooner than unnecessary delays allow. The Progress and Freedom Foundation has developed a replacement model for medical technology regulation that is designed to ensure the safety and effectiveness of medical products while providing patients with faster access to new treatments. The Progress and Freedom proposal offers competitive forces in order to eliminate the "regulatory creep" inherent in monopolies such as the FDA. While maintaining the existing legal requirements for safety and effectiveness and even the FDA stamp of approval, the plan relies on nongovernmental bodies to review and certify new medical products. 116 pp. CONTACT: The Progress & Freedom Foundation, 1301 K Street, N.W.

No. 1076, The Heritage Foundation</font>
<p><font size=3>
Denis Doyle, Heritage Foundation Visiting Fellow in Education, and Christine Olson, Heritage Policy Analyst, write that, the only overriding federal responsibility in education is to guarantee the constitutional right of all Americans, while acknowledging that Washington is also better equipped than the states to collect and display educational data than all the states and localities. However, as far as management of classroom instruction and curriculum, the federal government is suitable for little more than offering advice. Doyle and Olson outline The Back to Basics Education Reform Act (H.R. 1883), which seeks to eliminate the Department of Education within one year of enactment. They also look at another proposal to merge DOE with the Department of Labor and the EEOC. Overall, they conclude that Americans no longer support major federal solutions to quintessentially local problems. This report includes a detailed appendix that lists several unneeded programs administered by DOE as well as their budgets, their negative effects, and specific reasons for their termination. 44 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002-4999, 202/608-6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.

<b><font size=3>Dumbing Down Our Kids: <br>
Why American Children Feel Good About Themselves but Can't Read, Write, or Add,
</font></b><br><font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">by Charles Sykes
<p>
The Center for Education Reform</font>
<p><font size=3>
Charles Sykes, Senior Fellow at the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, illustrates the current crisis in American schools: Americans rank at the bottom of international tests in math and science; national reading scores continue to fall; and despite massive increases in spending, American schools continue to produce students who lack basic skills and knowledge. Sykes writes that the reaction within the education establishment to the decline in test scores has been to lower standards, and that what has triumphed is a "mediocre, feel good education that is more concerned with pumping self-esteem than it is with passing on knowledge." Sykes traces the roots of these educational fads to their current state today. He also discusses the following: why American students test poorly in language, math and science when compared with peers from other countries; why "self-esteem" has supplanted grades and genuine achievements in American schools; how the education teachers' unions and school boards lower standards while continuing to raise budgets and taxes; and how curriculum and standard tests are being dumbed down so everyone can pass but no one can excel. Sykes concludes the book with a checklist for parents, teachers and students who want to evaluate their schools, and a series of recommendations to restore the quality standards for learning. 339 pp. CONTACT: The Center for Education Reform, 1001 Connecticut Avenue, N.W.

<b><font size=3>Why South Carolina Should Drop Out of Goals 2000, 
</font></b><br><font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">by Sheldon Richman</font><p>

<i><font size=3>Issue Paper</font></i><font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">
, South Carolina Policy Council Foundation</font>
<P><font size=3>
Sheldon Richman, Vice President of Policy Affairs at the Future of Freedom Foundation, calls for South Carolina to drop out of Goals 2000. He examines each of Goals 2000's "goals" and shows how they will lead to more federal government intrusion, and ultimately federal control of curriculum, teaching practices, and even facilities. Richman warns that non-compliance with "voluntary" Goals 2000 directives could lead to litigation against states and local school districts. Significantly, some states-Montana, Alabama, California, Virginia, and New Hampshire-have already dropped out or refused funding because of "too many strings" attached to the funding and participation. In illustrating South Carolina's experience with Goals 2000, Richman notes that local educators and elected boards are losing their freedom to set agendas, to teach in the way they find effective, and to monitor their own progress. Richman concludes that Goals 2000 is: based on the flawed belief that all children and teachers are interchangeable; based on an unsound model of education looking at schools as factories; and based on the flawed view that bureaucratic government monopoly is public spirited and benign. 16 pp. CONTACT: South Carolina Policy Council Education Foundation, 1419 Pendleton Street, Columbia, SC  29201, 803/779-5022, fax 803/779-4953.

<p><font size=3>
If the state of Michigan takes from a land owner some, but not all, of the use or value of his land, the owner is not entitled to any compensation. This forces a few land owners to bear the entire cost of these "takings" that are intended to benefit the public as a whole. Many states have initiated reforms that would permit land owners to be more fairly compensated. This study outlines the practice of takings jurisprudence in Michigan, reviews the legislative responses in Michigan and other states, and makes specific recommendations for reform. 34 pp. CONTACT: The Mackinac Center for Public Policy, 119 Ashman St., P.O.

<b><font size=3>Finding Fault with No-Fault Divorce Laws:
A Policy Paper from Focus on the Family, <br></font></b>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">by Glenn Stanton<p>
Focus on the Family</font>
<p><font size=3>
Glenn Stanton, Social Research Analyst at Focus on the Family, illustrates that the no-fault divorce revolution-once touted by the women's liberation movement-has proven to be a failure. Starting with a brief history of divorce law in the United States, Stanton moves into a history of the no-fault movement, which started in California in 1969 and brought some form of no-fault law to the other forty-nine states by 1985. According to Stanton, the no-fault reformers had four goals: 1) to lower the already increasing divorce rate; 2) to foster greater equality between men and women; 3) to improve the lives of women and children; and 4) to expand individual choice and happiness. Stanton examines each one of these goals and shows that no-fault has had the exact opposite of the intended effects. The study concludes with policy recommendations. First, divorce laws should work to preserve the institution of marriage, and should give more balance to the rights of the party that desires to preserve the marriage. Next, couples who both agree they want to dissolve their marriages without having to show fault should face a substantial waiting period  before the divorce is granted. Also, division of property should be tied to fault. To change the current overwhelming disregard for the effects that divorce has on children, Stanton argues that the needs and desires of the parent should not override those of the children, which are, as a rule, the participation of both parents in their upbringing. Overall, Stanton believes that, divorce laws should make it more attractive to invest in marriage instead of divorce.  12 pp. CONTACT: Focus on the Family, 8605 Explorer Drive, Colorado Springs, CO 80920, 719/531-3400, fax 719/548-4525.

<b>CIR Reaches Successful Settlement in <i>Henry Painting Co. v. Ohio State University 
</i></b><br><font size=3>
CIR represents Jerry Henry, the white owner of Henry Painting Co., who, until 1986, regularly contracted with Ohio State University ("OSU") to perform painting contracts. However, since 1986, Henry Painting has been excluded from the bidding process because OSU has reserved all painting contracts for minority-owned businesses pursuant to a 100% set-aside program. That set aside program, in turn, was OSU's implementation of the Ohio State Minority Business Act, a state law requiring all state agencies to set aside 15% of all contracts for minority-owned businesses. Because OSU could not locate any minority bidders in other areas, it contrived to reach its 15% goal by reserving all of its painting contracts exclusively for minorities.<p>
In 1994, CIR, on behalf of Henry, brought suit against OSU challenging the constitutionality of OSU's set-aside practices. The lawsuit ended when the parties signed a binding judicial consent decree.  Under the consent decree, the State of Ohio agreed to an injunction against "considering race, color, national origin, gender, social or economic disadvantage, or any factor other than standard State procurement policies and practices, in awarding painting contracts at [OSU]."  OSU also agreed to pay the plaintiff $368,000 in damages and attorneys fees.
<p><b>CIR Challenges the Constitutionality of the 1994 Violence Against Women Act</b><br>
CIR is assisting in the defense of Antonio Morrison, a Virginia Tech student-athlete. Mr. Morrison, along with two other individuals and Virginia Tech, is named in a lawsuit filed by Christy Brzonkala, a student at the University. The lawsuit contains state and federal claims stemming from her alleged rape by Mr. Morrison and a codefendant in September 1994. Of importance to CIR is Brzonkala's attempt to impose civil and criminal liability upon Mr. Morrison under the so-called Violence Against Women Act ("VAWA").  CIR is arguing that VAWA represents an illegitimate exercise of Congressional power.<p>
Congress purported to pass VAWA pursuant to its authority under the Commerce Clause and Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment.  CIR contends that VAWA exceeds Congressional power under the Commerce Clause as defined by the Supreme Court in <i>United States v. Lopez</i>.<p>
A grand jury, after hearing testimony by the police, refused to indict Mr. Morrison for any criminal violation.<br><p>

<b>CIR Reaches Successful Settlement in<i> Doe v. United States</i></b>
<br>
CIR represents Michelle Doe, a young white high school student who wanted to attend Camp Planet Earth, a summer science camp which, based upon conditions set forth by the National Science Foundation to those receiving funds through its Summer Science Camp program, was open exclusively to minority students. Although Doe possessed strong academic credentials, Camp Planet Earth rejected her simply because of race. CIR brought suit against various state entities, including Texas A&M University, which operated the racially discriminatory summer science camp program, and the National Science Foundation. Doe has settled with the state entities and the federal government.  In addition to paying damages and attorneys' fees: 1) the state defendants agreed to discontinue any discriminatory practices on the basis of race, color, national origin, or ethnicity in selecting applicants for Camp Planet Earth; and 2) the federal defendants agreed to take reasonable steps to prevent discrimination by any summer science camp receiving funds from the National Science Foundation. Recent correspondence from Texas A&M indicates that it no longer wishes to operate Camp Planet Earth.<br></font><p>

<b><font size=4>DEFENDERS OF PROPERTY RIGHTS</font></b>
<p>
<b>Endangered Species Act is Before the Supreme Court </b>
<br>
Defenders of Property Rights is preparing a brief <i>amicus curiae</i>in the case of <i>Bennett v. Plenert</i>, requesting that the United States Supreme Court reverse the decision of the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in that case. At issue is whether plaintiffs asserting an interest other than preservation of endangered species may sue the government for violating the procedures established by the Endangered Species Act ("ESA").<p> 

Plaintiffs in this case are two individual ranchers and two irrigation districts located in the state of Oregon. They filed a "citizens suit" challenging a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biological opinion that concluded that the preservation of the endangered Lost River sucker and shortnose sucker (species of fish) requires that the water level in two reservoirs be maintained at a designated minimum level.  The plaintiffs who use the reservoirs' water for commercial and recreational purposes, claim the government violated certain provisions of the ESA by neglecting to consider the economic impact caused by its finding that the reservoirs were critical habitats for the fish.<p>
	
In affirming the lower court's dismissal of plaintiffs' complaint, the Ninth Circuit Court astonishingly held that "only plaintiffs who allege an interest in the preservation of endangered species" may bring citizen suits under the ESA.  The ranchers and irrigation districts, the court held, did not fall within this category. "To the contrary," the court wrote, "they claim a competing interestan interest in using the very water that the government believes is necessary for the preservation of the species."  Because the ranchers' and irrigation districts' interests in the water were solely economic and recreational, the court held that they could not sue to force the government to comply with the ESA.  The court held thus, notwithstanding that it was "aware that the ESA specifically provides that the government should consider a variety of factorsincluding economic onesin designing critical habitat for a species."<p>
	
This Ninth Circuit opinion is the legacy of the last term's <i>Sweet Home </i> case, where the U.S. Supreme Court stated that the ESA's citizen suit provision was designed to further the goal of species protection by allowing "interested persons" to sue to enforce the ESA."  As well as quoting from the Sweet Home case, the Ninth Circuit also cited with approval the 1978 Supreme Court case <i>Tennessee Valley Authority v. Hill</i>, wherein the Court had earlier concluded "[T]he plain intent of Congress in enacting [the ESA] was to halt and reverse the trend toward extinction, whatever the cost."

<b><i>Terry L. and Gayle E. Beardslee v. Crawford County Road Commission</i></b>
<br>
On July 19, 1994, Terry and Gayle Beardslee awoke to find a bulldozer belonging to the Crawford County Road Commission on their forty acres of woodlands in upstate Michigan. Without notice, public hearing, or offer of compensation, the county bulldozer proceeded to destroy hundreds of the Beardslee's trees, shrubs, and other landscaping to clear an abandoned and overgrown logging trail that the county decided to claim as public highway.<p>

When the Beardslee's bought the property in 1989, neither the title insurance policy nor a survey of the land indicated a claim to the trail that diagonally traversed their property.  Impassable in many places, they erected barriers and posted no trespassing signs at both ends of the trail.<p>

In the process of improving this proposed road, the county expanded the eight-to-ten foot wide trail to fifteen feet. An attorney retained by the Beardslees advised them that no documents of record give the county any public right-of-way across their property.
<p>
The Beardslees are now telling their story in state court.  They are seeking compensation from the Road Commission for the damage already done to their property, and to have the road moved elsewhere.  Defenders of Property Rights is standing by the Bedraggles' request to make sure that the Road Commission is obedient to the Fifth Amendment.

Three justices decided against the program because of a violation of the Wisconsin Constitution, including the state establishment clause.  They did not reach a decision on whether the program violated the Establishment Clause under the U.S. Constitution or the First Amendment issue. The other three justices believe the program is constitutional in all respects.  Of the three justices against the program, one is retiring and a new justice was recently elected to replace him.

<b>Property Rights in Michigan's Upper Peninsula</b>
<br>
In a nationally-significant case regarding the ability of the U.S. Forest Service to manage private property as wilderness, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit granted MSLF's petition for a rehearing en banc. The Court also vacated an earlier decision by a three judge panel upholding the authority of the Forest Service.
<p>
Lake front property owners in the Upper Penisula of Michigan have been denied their right to use the entire surface of Crooked Lakea right recognized by Michigan Lawby U.S. Forest Service regulation. The Forest Service asserts that since it owns property abutting the southern portion of the Lake, it may regulate the Lake. The Forest Servie claims the Property Clause of the Constitution gives it such authority over private property even though Congress specifically excluded private property from wilderness designation or management.

Despite SCC's submittal of the lowest bid, the contract was awarded to the next higher bidder because of Mr. Keritsis' race.

<b>Air Force Base Converison Victory Upheld</b><br>

The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit in Boston has affirmed a lower court decision allowing continued leasing at the site of the former Pease Air Force Base.  This decision keeps New Hampshire's largest source of new civilian jobs on track. NELF has represented the Greater Portsmouth Chamber of Commerce and two other business groups since 1992 when an environmental group brought suit to block the federal government's sale of Pease to a state agency set up to convert the base to commercial use. NELF and the New Hampshire business community strongly support Pease as a key element in the state's ongoing return to economic health. Some national environmental groups had proposed using litigation threats to block conversion of military bases in order to coerce concesssions from state and federal governments.  By rejecting their case here, the court struck a blow against the plan.

<b>Brown University Title IX Case Argued in Court of Appeals</b><br>
Brown University has argued its appeal of use of Title IX to micromanage the university's athletic programs.  The case is a key test of how willing courts will be to use anti-discrimination laws as the basis for strict quotas.  On behalf of several national associations of coaches and athletes, NELF argued that Brown has provided equal athletic opportunities for both sexes and the different number of male and female intercollegiate athletes reflects student interests beyond the schools control.

<b>U.S. Supreme Court Decides <i>O'Connor v. Consolidated Coin</i>Case</b>
<br>
In a defeat for the business community, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that virtually any worker over 40 years of age, replaced by a younger person, can bring a "prima facie" age discrimination claim, even if a replacement is also over 40. The Court reversed a lower court decision NELF had supported, which held that a plaintiff could only take advantage of "prima facie" inference if the replacement came from outside the protected class. The decision did leave open a ray of hope, noting the case might have come out differently if age difference had been "insignificant."

<b>Certiorari Denied in <i>Leger</i> and <i>NARPO</i></b><br>
The U.S. Supreme Court has denied petitions for certiorari in <i>NARPO v. ICC</i> and <i>Leger v.

While denial of certiorari has no precedential significance, it means that these cases are at an end.

<b>Court Says 'No' To Arbitrary Fees For Landowners</b>
<br>
For several years, Richard Ehrlich operated a private tennis club but was unable to make a financial success of it. In 1988, he closed the facility and donated most of the movable equipment to the city and proposed a townhouse condominium project on the property. The City Council approved the project on condition that Mr. Ehrlich pay $280,000, which the city estimated was the cost of building replacement tennis courts. They also demanded that he pay over $33,000 for public art.
<p>
PLF argued that the fees are unconstitutional for failing the "rough proportionality" test laid down in <i>Dolan v. City of Tigard</i>. Conditions for a permit are justifiable only if local officials can show that there is a reasonable connection or essential "nexus" between the conditions and any harm caused by the project being permitted. The extent of the exations must also be "roughly proportional" to the project's impact on the community. The <i>Ehrlich</i> case differs in that the property owner is being asked to come up with cash instead of land.<p>

Citing PLF's victories in <i>Dolan</i> and <i>Nollan v. California Coastal Commission</i>, the state Supreme Court held that local bureaucrats cannot arbitrarily and capriciously shift the cost of public projects on private landowners in the form of development fees. 
<p>
Unfortunately, the court did not go far enough. Under the court's equivical reasoning, the tough standards established in <i>Nollan</i> and <i>Dolan</i> now apply to some, but not all, fees imposed on land use approvals. In other words, bureaucrats are subject to scrutiny only when property owners have to individually "negotiate" over terms of their particular permits.
<p>
Applying the "new" standard to Mr. Ehrlich, the state justices nevertheless ruled that he must still pay $33,220 for public art and that he must go back to the city so that the bureaucrats can have a second shot at justifying their $280,000 recreational fee.

<b>Bureaucrats Force Landowners To Sustain Economic Losses</b>
<br>
Leon Scharf is the principle owner of a 70-year-old apartment building in New York. In February 1994, the building was ravaged by fire. What was not burned was damaged by water used to fight the blaze. Consequently, the building was no longer safe for its tenants who had to relocate. Repairing the building to habitable condition would have far exceeded its fair market value, and yet the former tenants (also beneficiaries of New York's rent control law at Mr. Scharf's expense) filed suit demanding that the building be rebuilt so that their protected tenancies may be resumed.
<p>
New York's special Housing Court agreed that repairs would cost more than the market value of the building after restoration. However, the court ruled that this fact "was not dispositive." Instead, it held that Mr. Scharf had a "duty" to restore the property and that the tenants were "entitled" to have "their" apartment building restored. According to the court, it is Mr. Scharfnot the public as a wholewho must satisfy the city's need for affordable housing. 
<p>
In short, Mr. Scharf is being forced into a course of action guaranteed to cause a substantial loss of economically viable use of his property, not simply because the cost of restoration exceeds the fair market value itself has been severly depressed in the first place by the regulatory regime on New York's rent control laws. Pacific Legal Foundation argued to a New York appellate court that the government's demand that he repair this uninhabitable building is an unconstitutional regulatory "taking" of his property.

<b>SLF Attempts Intervention in Voting Rights Act Lawsuit Against State of Georgia</b>
<br>
On behalf of an elected member of the Georgia General Assembly, a candidate for office, and a Georgia voter, SLF has waded into the legislative redistricting battle underway in Georgia. SLF contends that Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, which empowers the U.S. Department of Justice to "pre-clear" any voting district changes in 16, mostly Southern, states is an unconstitutional usurpation of judicial power by the executive branch.
<p>
In its effort to challenge the outdated pre-clearance section of the Act, SLF attempted to intervene in a pending lawsuit filed by the U.S. Department of Justice against the State of Georgia for its most recent state redistricting efforts, which demanded that Georgia instead use its 1992 legislative map. The 1992 map has come under intense scrutiny by the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in a separate but related action underway since 1994 for its use of race as a sole criteria for legislative redistricting.
<p>
Attempting to intervene before the same three-judge court which is hearing the legislative redistricting case, SLF asked the court to enter its clients as co-defendants in the action, arguing that the citizens of Georgia have standing to raise constitutional questions not raised by the State defendants. In early April, the three-judge court in Atlanta granted provisional intervention status to SLF's clients. Within a week the Court had withdrawn the status, reasoning that SLF's claims were "too remote." SLF is currently preparing a direct appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court under the Voting Rights Act on the issue of intervention status of citizens to challenge the pre-clearance section of the Voting Rights Act.

<b>SEC Urged to Recognize Self-Audit Privilege</b>
<br>
WLF filed a petition for rulemaking with the Securities and Exchange Commission urging the agency to adopt a policy against using a company's internal evaluations or self-audits in enforcement actions. Such self-audits are a tool that companies use to strengthen their compliance with federal securities laws. WLF argued that SEC policy should reflect that self-audits by companies are indispensable to the SEC's efforts in maintaining compliance with those laws.
<p>
WLF argued that the SEC should insititute a broad privilege of confidentiality for firms' self-critical evaluations or audits that lead to the correction of improper activity. According to commentators, the SEC "is increasingly requesting production in its investigations of routine internal audit reports and reports of special investigations." The petition states that the SEC has created a powerful barrier to self-critical initiatives by failing to recognize such a privilege.

WLF Asks Supreme Court to Reject State Suits on FDA-Approved Medical Devices
In <i>Medtronic, Inc. v. Lohr</i>, WLF filed a brief in the U.S. Supreme Court arguing that state-law suits claiming injuries caused by FDA-approved medical devices are impermissible because they are pre-empted by federal law. WLF argued that, given the extensive regulation of medical device design and marketing by the FDA, permitting still more regulation at the state level (in the form of lawsuits) would discourage development of new and useful medical devices. WLF further argued that the plain language of the 1976 amendments to the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act indicates that Congress intended to preempt state product liability suits against a medical device manufacturer that has complied with FDA labeling and manufacturing requirements. The <i>Medtronic</i> case is being watched closely by the business community, because it will provide a strong indication of the High Court's willingness to bar state-law suits against manufacturers whose products are already subject to significant federal regulation. 
<br><p>
<b>Regulators Must Prove Knowledge of Clean Water Act Violations</b>
<br>
WLF filed a brief in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in <i>United States v. Ahmad</i>, urging the court to overturn a criminal conviction under the Clean Water Act because the district court refused to instruct the jury that the government must prove that the defendant had knowledge of all the elements of the offense. Alternatively, WLF asked the court to set aside the unduly harsh 21-month prison sentence for the first offender because the Sentencing Guidelines for environmental infractions were unlawfully promulgated by the Sentencing Commission and are otherwise flawed.
<p>
WLF argued in its brief that Congress intended that "knowing" violations require the government to prove knowledge of all the elements of the offense. WLF urged the Court to follow the Fourth Circuit which requires a higher intent standard than the Ninth Circuit's lower standard recently enunciated in <i>United States v. Weitzenhoff</i>.

<h2>May 1996 <i>Insider</i></h2>
<h3>In Focus: Book Review</h3>
</center><p>
<i>Temptations of a Superpower</i><br>
by Ronald Steel, Cambridge University Press 1995
<hr>
<p>
In his latest work, <i>Temptations of a Superpower</i>, Ronald Steel scores against what he views as a U.S. foreign policy that has outlived its usefulness, taking a brief, but well-targeted, stab at the present foreign policy dilemma of the United States.  What role should America play in the post-Cold War international arena?  Should the U.S. move toward an interventionist strategy, or pull back into an isolationist position?  Mr. Steel, Professor of International Relations at the University of Southern California and author of <i>Walter Lippman and the American Century</i>, skillfully dissects the underlying principles that served as the pillars of American Cold War foreign policy, while pointing out that new ones are needed.<p>

He begins by undermining the widely accepted notion that the United States "won" the Cold War, questioning whether the United States has come to a position as world leader by its own design or purely by default. With the absence of a great power as an opponent,  Steel argues that the U.S. role as superpower has lost its onus.  With global conflicts changing from quarrels between nation-states to intra-state ethnic and religious disputes, the former policies aimed at containment are becoming increasingly outdated.  He states: "Now we are alone:  a superpower without a challenger, a crusader without a mission."  The rules of the game are changing, but the United States continues to dance singly to the tune of the Cold War, at the risk of sacrificing significant domestic concerns and endangering the nation's pocketbook.
<p>
Wilsonian ideas, such as collective security and self-determination, combined with an entrenched, elitist bureaucracy are competing with Cold War goals, methods, and attitudes, writes Steel. Though alliance-building can serve well in situations involving only nation-states, Steel believes that collective security will only escalate today's smaller, yet complex, intra-state conflicts into regional problems. Furthermore, Steel asserts that the idea of self-determination is so impossibly open-ended that, even after years of debate, it cannot translate into practical foreign policy.  However well-intentioned it may be, it is rooted in the basic assumption that differing people cannot live together, an idea completely contrary to the American experience.  
<p>
The foreign policy "establishment" must also be addressed, according to Steel.  These estranged bureaucrats, hidden away from public scrutiny, have agendas and perspectives all their own.  They make their livings off of a bureaucratic organism that gorged itself on tax dollars (and continues to do so) during the Cold War, and now, even without the need for such monstrous budgets, they strive to maintain this behemoth in a symbiotic effort to preserve their own jobs. Steel believes that these "experts" have become ends unto themselves, and no longer the means for creating sound foreign policy.  
<p>
Steel advises a new direction for foreign policy based principally on self-interest, without the moral baggage that has so characterized many U.S. international policies.  Promoting democracy, confronting "hostile" ideologies, or acting as moral guardian should play a lesser role in American foreign policy.  He pushes the ideas of selective engagement and benign spheres of influence.  With specific guidelines set by a principle of selective engagement, the United States would intervene globally only when its vital interests are threatened. He then relinquishes the responsibility of "conflict management" to the regions in which the conflicts occur.  For example, just as Vietnam once halted the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, so would European states themselves supervise the present situation in Bosnia. Steel believes that this regional self-accountability will more easily provide global stability than an ever-widening U.S. umbrella.
<p>
<i>Temptations of a Superpower</i> is a clearly and concisely written critique, but this published lecture is a bit brief, and lacks detail in many areas.  In addition, it is purely academic, and focuses only on description, by-passing the much needed element of prescription.  Despite this,  Steel has written a quite enjoyable and provocative work, and is well worth the few hours required to read it.

<h3>April 1996 <i>Insider</i></h3>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>Justice, Freedom, the Flat Tax, 
and the Tithe</FONT></B></CENTER>
<hr><P>
<font size=3> The last thing you should worry about when you study the matter of various flat tax 
proposals is whether it will take a 17 percent or 21 percent rate to work. From a biblical 
perspective, two far higher priorities on taxes should be the issues of justice and freedom. 
Both are recurring biblical themes, and both are terribly jeopardized by the present tax 
system in the United States. By contrast, both would be remarkably enhanced with almost 
any flat tax approach. <p>
	Complexity, almost always, is the enemy of justice. Simplicity is its friend. As soon as 
matters get complex, in virtually any venue, the opportunity for corruption takes over. When 
people cant understand a tax code, they get either cynical or opportunistic, and neither 
attitude is congenial to evenhanded justice.<p> 
	Its pretty hard, for example, to beat the simplicity of the tithe. No one can ever come to 
Gods court of appeals arguing that calculating 10 percent was just too difficult, or that he 
couldnt find a tithe consultant smart enough to figure it out.<p> 
	By the same token, its noteworthy that God never established one tithe for the wealthy and 
another for the poor and common folk. The rate was the same, and we can assume that God 
considers that arrangement just. The book of Proverbs reminds us bluntly that were not to 
use two sets of standards in any financial dealings. <p>
	To be sure, almost none of the flat tax proposals now being suggested for our country is even 
yet really equal in its application. To exempt the first $36,000 (or thereabouts) of everyones 
income before starting to apply a 17 percent tax clearly favors the poor, who under such a 
plan would pay no tax at all. And Im not persuaded yet that individual income from interest 
and dividends should be exempted from taxationan idea that will appear to many to favor 
the rich, despite the argument that this income is already taxed at the corporate level. But 
thats why I say we shouldnt get hung upup least yetin the details. The simplicity of the 
proposals tends radically toward justice, and that should be appealing to biblically minded 
folks. <p>
	The other important reason for favoring a flat tax rate is that it would promote freedom. In 
one fell swoop, the flat tax minimizes the role of government in all its attempts to 
micromanage society and culture. For far too long now have we allowed great segments of 
our public life to be driven by tax considerations. The big government social engineers tinker 
constantly with the tax code: tax incentives here, tax deductions there, write-offs for this 
desirable goal, and five-year forgiveness clauses if you take on some other cause the 
government happens to like.<p> 
	The power to tax is indeed the power to destroy, but by extension it is also the power to 
shape a societys values and idealsand in doing so to establish which freedoms will be 
promoted and which will be restricted. So it is a wise people who place simple but strong 
restraints on their governments ability to drill a million holes in the tax code.<p> 
	I say all this fully aware that my employer, World magazine, gets part of its lifeblood from 
tax-deductible gifts from readersand that such revenue might be at least a little jeopardized 
if charitable contributions are no longer tax deductible. <p>
	Not to worry! For that is the very point. As long as people make gifts, even to worthy causes, 
primarily because they are tax deductible and not because that cause is passionately 
important to them, both the tax code and the government behind it are way too important. 
Yes, we may lose a few gifts to our charitable organizationsbut in the end, both we and 
they will breathe so much more deeply of the great air of freedom that it will be a good trade.<p> 
	I have no idea whether a 17 percent flat tax or one at 21 percent will be needed to sustain our 
government through the transition that is coming. Either way, its a great bargainnot 
because of the rate, but because of where the idea ultimately takes us. <p>

<font size=3>In 1995, The Heritage Foundation created a Missile Defense Study Team, 
Team B, to look at the growing threat of ballistic missiles armed with weapons of mass 
destruction and  produced a report that recommended timely, affordable and technically
sound responses to a missile threat in the form of a missile defense system. This update
offers several new recommendations to adjust to the delays and negative developments
that have characterized the missile defense program in the past year including: <br>
<ol><li>the U.S. Senate should seek ways to remove the obstacles to effective missile
defenses posed by the ABM Treaty, including possible withdrawal from the treaty; <li>
Congress should forego development of ground-based systems for national missile 
defense and accelerate deployment of sea-based, wide-area defenses; <li>Congress
should accelerate the deployment of space-based sensors to enhance the effectiveness 
of both theater and national missile defense; <li>Congress should direct the Air Force 
to develop follow-on space-based defenses to begin deployment early in the next decade; 
<li>Congress should ensure that the Ballistic Missile Defense Office develops an integrated,
but open, architecture for battle management, command, control, and communications to 
support missile defense systems.</ol>14 pp. CONTACT: Chris OScannlain, The Heritage

Richard Fisher, Senior Policy Analyst at the Heritage Foundation, believes that deterring conflict in the 
Taiwan Strait is the most important challenge for American foreign policy in early 1996. China has 
militarily intimidated the emerging democratic system of Taiwan ever since the Republic of Chinas 
President, Lee Tenghui, visited the United States in June of 1995. According to Fisher, what is at stake in 
Taiwan is not only peace and stability in the region, but the viability of democracy in Taiwan. Since 1987 
the Republic of China has sought democratic political reforms that will soon make Taiwan a democracy.

the history of government regulation of the electromagnetic wireless spectrum and how it relates

have been used to justify continued government regulation and infringement of First Amendment 
rights. Thierer calls for the following steps to be taken to ensure meaningful free market reforms:
<br><ol><li>provide fully flexible, perpetual property rights in spectrum; <li>government agencies 
responsible for managing the spectrum should be required to allocate and auction off as much of 
the spectrum as possible;<li>redefine (or define for the first time) the &quot;public interest&quot;

This report by Richard Vedder, John M. Olin Visiting Professor of Labor Economics and Public Policy at 
the Center for the Study of American Business, argues that the U.S. GDP today might be 20 percent higher 
if the regulatory buildup that began in the Johnson Administration had not occured. According to his 
analysis, if regulatory activity remained at 1963 levels, the 1993 U.S. GDP would have been about $7.6 
trillion instead of $6.3 trillion. Vedder notes that regulation imposes direct costs, requiring businesses to 
commit resources to implement governmental mandates. He concludes by writing that while some 
regulations are necessary, such as those on food and drugs, other regualtions have expanded without fully 
considering the costs and consequences of such action. 13 pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of

No.77, Center for the Study of American Business <BR></FONT>
<P>
Chairman of Center for the Study of American Business Murray Weidenbaum argues that nearly all of the 
attention in public policy discussions and legislation aimed at reducing the regulatory burden on business is 
focused on either very large enterprises or very small businesses. According to Weidenbaum, medium 
sized firms do not benefit from the protections provided to small businesses or the economies of scale 
generated by large businesses. Fortune 500 companies fill out basically the same forms and meet the same 
requirements as medium-sized firms. Therefore, the cost of complying with regulation is a higher percent 
of sales for the medium-sized firms than for larger ones. Weidenbaum shows that Congress has responded 
to the issue of uneven distribution of regulatory burdens in the predictable manner. Instead of reducing the 
burden of regulation, it has arbitrarily exempted companies of different sizes. He gives as an example, a 
series of federal regulations that take effect when a company hires its 50th employee. Because of this, some 
small firms are reluctant to expand. Weidenbaum concludes by recommending that Congress significantly 
reform and reduce regulation on business. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business,

<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">
Reason Foundation</FONT>
<P>
The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) and the five power marketing administrations (PMAs) are the 
entities that make the federal government the nations largest producer of electric power. According to 
Douglas Houston, Professor of Business Economics at the University of Kansas, these electricity 
businesses, along with other federally subsidized cooperatives and municipal utilities, are inefficient, 
poorly managed and at risk in the environment of electricity competition. Houston argues that privatizing 
federal electricity and ending current subsidies would have the following benefits:<br><ol><li>
the sale of federal power enterprises would raise $15-30 billion to reduce the national debt; <li>$7-10 billion in direct subsidies 
to government-owned utilities and cooperatives would end; <li> privatization would lead to improved 
performance and efficiency and eliminate the political interference in management and investment 
decisions that government owned utilities have to face; and <li> putting the transmission grids of the TVA 
and the PMAs into the emerging competitive market would promote efficiency and lower prices for 
consumers.</ol> Overall, Houston concludes that ending electricity subsidies and privatizing is a win-win 
situation. 36 pp. CONTACT: Reason Foundation, 3415 S. Sepulveda Blvd., Suite 400, Los Angeles, CA

Robert Poole, President of the Reason Foundation, writes that although Wisconsin has an excellent 
highway system, the majority of the states major highways will require reconstruction during the next 25 
years. Complicating matters, the Wisconsin Department of Transportation projects that current funding 
sources will fall $8.9 billion short of paying for the needed maintenance. As a solution to the shortfall, 
Poole proposes a public-private partnership to build toll roads in the state highway system. Poole believes 
that such a partnership has many benefits, including: highway innovations, new funding sources, risk 
transfer, new tax revenue, reduced operating costs, better-maintained roads, greater safety levels, 
congestion relief. Potential problems include: loss of public control, bankruptcy, labor issues and higher 
financing costs. Poole concludes with a description of what steps should be taken to bring about toll roads 
as a solution to Wisconsins highway maintenance problems including: a detailed feasability study and 
state and federal legislation to provide the adequate legal framework. 27 pp. CONTACT: Wisconsin Policy

According Transportation expert Peter Samuel, taxpayers are the biggest losers in American transportation 
policy. Samuel writes that although transportation policy is in need of reform in order to pay for its massive 
costs and to best serve the interests of commuters, entrenched interests stand in the way of meaningful 
reform. Those interests that directly influence transportation policy in Washington include: highway 
construction companies seeking more federally funded projects; social engineers seeking transit systems 
that conform to their ideals; and automobile organizations, such as AAA, who fight against such policy 
innovations as private toll roads that they feel threaten travel and commerce. Samuel illustrates the 
historical development of the transportation lobbies into what they are today and provides a history of 
government highway and transportation policy. Samuel concludes his report by saying that the first step of 
achieving reform is to realize that government monopoly in roads is not the solution. New technology and 
privatization are the answer, although it will entail taking on the entrench transportation lobbying forces 
inside the Beltway. 5 pp. CONTACT: Capital Research Center, 727 15th St., NW, 8th Floor, Washington,

Jerry Bowyer, President of the Allegheny Institute, criticizes a study prepared last year in the University of 
Pittsburghs &quot;Economic Benchmarks&quot; report, as well as other studies that suggest that racial prejudice is 
doing severe harm to the economic conditions of blacks, and that the city of Pittsburgh is worse in this 
regard than the rest of the nation. Bowyer provides evidence that economic disparity can almost entirely be 
attributed to a combination of distinct demographic patterns and behavioral factors within the black 
community and not racial prejudice. He notes that the University of Pittsburgh study does not take into 
account such factors as family structure and high school and college drop out rates. The researchers instead 
just measure disparity, and on this issue it is not even complete. Bowyer argues that it is irresponsible to 
report racial income disparity figures in a racially charged urban atmosphere, where the figures are likely to 
be misinterpreted, unless steps are taken to make sure that the results are properly understood. Bowyer 
concludes that these studies, because of their omissions, are more likely to further economic disparities 
than promote problemsolving. CONTACT: Allegheny Institute for Public Policy, Suite 612, 7 Parkway

Michael Cox and Beverly Fox, of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, explore why media reports paint a 
bleak picture of the average American workers prospects today, despite very positive economic indicators 
suggesting that the economy is thriving. After examining several different economic trends, the authors 
conclude that they are no cause for alarm. An examination of the dataan increase in employee benefits, a 
decline in median household or family size, and a shortening in the average workweekprovides a fairly 
bright picture of Americans improving living standards. According to Fox and Cox, from the perspective 
of the most long term and broadest economic aggregates, per capita real GDP and consumption, recent 
gains for Americans are on par with overall historical gains. 11 pp. CONTACT: National Center for Policy

John Sweeney, Policy Analyst at the Heritage Foundation, argues that the Clinton Administration has 
retreated from promoting the expansion of free trade in the Western hemisphere. Sweeney points out that 
during the past year the President has reneged on his pledge to include Chile in NAFTA by 1996, and the 
that Administration has violated key provisions of the treaty. Sweeney calls for several steps to be taken by 
the President to correct the current drift away from free trade:<br><ol><li>the U.S. should fulfill all of its NAFTA 
obligations on schedule; <li> NAFTA should be expanded; <li> Mexico should be encouraged to adopt a 
currency board; <li> the Administration should offer to negotiate forgiveness of Mexicos public sector 
foreign debt; and <li> the Administration should offer to negotiate a law enforcement agreement with 
Mexico to deal with the growing problem of international organized crime and drug trafficking.</ol> Sweeney 
also proposes a free-market solution for Mexican monetary troubles, writing that Clintons $50 billion 
bailout of Mexico has not only failed to stop the trend of devaluation, depression and eventual default, it 
also ignored principles of free-trade. 14 pp. CONTACT: Chris OScannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214

Ronald Utt, Visiting Fellow at The Heritage Foundation, suggests a strategy for Congress to get its budget 
and policy goals back on track. He argues that if Congress hopes to enact its legislative agenda this year, it 
should adopt a two-year budget and break down appropriations bills into more manageable pieces of 
legislation, noting that Clintons 1997 budget is already out, even though all the appropriations for 1996 
have yet to be passed. Utt also argues that Congress should not use last years strategy of waiting until the 
end of the year to present the president with an all-or-nothing appropriations bill. This strategy backfired 
and allowed President Clinton to avoid an open debate on the issue. If the appropriations process is broken 
down into smaller bills, contends Utt, Congress can directly debate policy on a program-by-program basis. 
This would expose the negative aspects of the Presidents defense of the status quo. Utt points out that the 
same strategy can be used on entitlement programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and welfare. Reforms in 
these programs were vetoed at once when combined in one huge reconciliation bill. If they were free 
standing measures, however, there would be a better chance of conducting a substantive policy debate. 7

Scott Hodge, Grover M. Herman Fellow in Federal Budgetary Affairs at The Heritage Foundation, 
illustrates that the Clinton Administration is still for big government, despite claims to the contrary. Hodge 
finds that the FY 1997 Clinton budget continues the era of big government in several ways: it increases 
federal spending by $361 billion over the next seven years and hikes tax revenue by $526 billion; it spends 
a total of $12.16 trillion over the next seven years, or $306 billion more than the vetoed Balance Budget 
Act of 1995$3,155 more for every household in America; it raises a total of $11.4 trillion in tax revenues 
over seven years, $187 billion more than the BBA, and $1,927 more in taxes for every household in 
America; it allows $119 billion more deficit spending through 2002 than the BBA, which is equivalent to 
passing along $1,227 per household in debt to the next generation of America workers; it fails to eliminate a 
single program of any significance; it fails to eliminate even one Cabinet-level agency; it increases 
entitlement spending by $365 billion over the next seven years while failing to save Medicare from 
bankruptcy, end welfare as we know it, or protect states from exploding costs of Medicaid; and it spends 
$111 billion more in spending on programs that have failed or become obsolete, that duplicate others, or 
that should be transferred to state and local government control. 13 pp. CONTACT: Chris OScannlain,

The 17 percent flat tax plan sponsored by House Majority Leader, Dick Armey, and Sen. Richard Shelby, 
shows no increase in the taxes paid by the vast majority of middle-class Americans when compared with 
their current tax burden, according to William Beach, Visiting Fellow in Tax Analysis, and Dan Mitchell, 
Heritage McKenna Senior Fellow in Political Economy. In fact, a 17percent  flat tax, on average, would 
lower taxes on all income groups. Based on IRS income-tax files for 1991, under a 17 percent flat tax, 
households with less than $15,000 per year in taxable income will experience a nearly 50 percent drop in 
their tax burden. Moreover, About 24 million families who pay federal income taxes now will pay no 
federal income taxes under the fully implemented Armey-Shelby flat tax, the analysts say, and nearly 
everyone else below $30,000 in taxable income will see their taxes fall. According to Beach and Mitchell, 
lower taxes will not mean higher deficits. The loss in individual income tax revenue under the Armey-
Shelby plan will be offset by increased revenue from middle-sized and big businesses. 7 pp. CONTACT:

Dan Mitchell, McKenna Senior Fellow in Political Economy at the Heritage Foundation, points out that 
polls show that workers, investors, savers, entrepreneurs, farmers, small business owners, and the elderly 
are among the groups of Americans drawn to the flat-tax because they feel that they will pay less. He then 
gives and elaborates on eight reasons why another group, liberals, should support the flat tax:<br><ol><li>the key 
philosophical principle of the flat tax is equality; <li> lower rates result in the rich shouldering more of the 
tax burden; <li>current deductions disproportionately benefit the wealthy and others able to exploit

Bruce Bartlett, Senior Fellow at the Alexis de Toqueville Institution, illustrates how the mortgage interest 
deduction has become the untouchable &quot;third rail&quot; in any discussion of a flat tax. This is despite the fact 
that homeowners would gain more from a flat-rate tax than they would lose if the mortgage deduction was 
taken away. Nonetheless, Bartlett points out, realtors have declared &quot;war&quot; against the flat tax. He 
dismantles the key study issued by the National Association of Realtors by DRI/McGraw-Hill, a private 
economic consulting firm, that concludes the Armey flat tax proposal would cause housing prices to 
collapse from the elimination of the mortgage interest deduction. According to Bartlett, not only would 
mortgage rates fall by about 18 percent as soon as the flat tax takes effect,  in the unlikely event that a flat 
tax caused housing prices to fall, the decline would only be temporary. Furthermore, the flat tax would benefit homeowners by eliminating the capital 
gains tax. 9 pp. CONTACT: National Center for Policy Analysis, 12655 N. Central Expy., Suite 720,

This issue features two articles examining grants made by the Center for Disease Control and the National 
Cancer Institute to nonprofit anti-smoking organizations. The articles discuss how tax dollars granted for 
disease research and public health education have been funneled into political advocacy. James Bennett, 
Professor of Economics at George Mason University, looks at the National Cancer Institutes illegal use of 
federal funds to promote a Colorado ballot initiative to raise the states tobacco tax. He unveils front 
groups created to provide a smokescreen for lobbying; state bureaucrats using state offices to facilitate 
lobbying; and the selling of positions of authority. In the other article Thomas DiLorenzo, Senior Fellow at 
the Capital Research Center, shows that the Center for Disease Control (CDC) is heavily involved in 
funding political advocacy. He centers on a $30,000 grant the CDC awarded to the American Lung 
Associations (ALA) May 1993 conference, Seize the Initiative: A National Training Conference for 
Increasing Tobacco Excise Taxes Through Initiated Acts. DiLorenzo states that CDC diverted from its 
mission of conducting disease research and educating the public about health issues to teaching political 
organizing and lobbying techniques, a blatantly illegal use of tax money. 8 pp. CONTACT: Capital

Richard Vedder, Professor of Economics at Ohio University, argues that capital cities in the United States 
are &quot;parasite economies&quot; which drain resources from surrounding areas. According to Vedder, lawyers, 
lobbyists, legislators, bureaucrats, and government contractors take productive resources from the average 
taxpayer to fill their own pockets. Vedder uses statistical comparisons of factors such as income, 
population change, unemployment, and working conditions to illustrate how capital cities &quot;siphon&quot;wealth 
from other areas. He shows that the average annual pay for workers in the Washington D.C. area exceeds 
the national average by 48 percent. Furthermore, the per capita income in the capital cities of the poorest 
states are about 17 percent above the state averages. Vedder concludes by saying that it is not a coincidence 
that a majority of the state capitals that have gained the most in relative affluence are in the poorest states. 
According to Vedder, this shows that the taxes that finance affluent capitals crowd out private-sector 
activity that is usually more efficient and productive than government activity. 23 pp. CONTACT: Cato

According to Heritage Health Care Policy Analyst John Lui, the National Governors Associations 
Medicaid reform plan ignores many of the biggest problems of the current system. He writes that the 
highly touted Medicaid reform plan drafted by the governors contains many needed reforms, but unless a 
final bill differs sharply in some critical details, the plan will be a disaster. The governors plan claims to 
scrap the Medicaid entitlement in favor of a system of block grants to the states, yet preserves a long list of 
benefits that must be provided to a large, entitled population. In addition, since the governors decision to 
guarentee Medicaid coverage to so many people will impose heavy burdens on state budgets, they also 
included an &quot;umbrella insurance&quot; provision that, in effect, &quot;entitles&quot; states to federal money. If states 
experience an unanticipated rise in the number of people eligible for Medicaid, the federal government 
would bear the cost, which almost certainly would increase the federal deficit. Liu recommends that 
Congress make the following changes to the governors plan:<br><ol><li>sharply limit the guaranteed populations 
and benefits of the entitlement; and <li>the umbrella should be a budgeted fund appropriated each year, not 
an entitlement to states.</ol> 3 pp. CONTACT: Chris OScannlain, The Heritage Foundation, 214

Robert Rector, Senior Policy Analyst at the Heritage Foundation, criticizes the National Governors 
Associations welfare reform proposal for entirely ignoring the No. 1 problem that experts say perpetuates 
the welfare culture, illegitimacy. He also points out that the NGA plan repudiates most of the key elements 
of the Contract with America. The Contracts welfare reform was based on three themes: a national goal of 
reducing illegitimacy; national work requirements; and greater flexibility to state governments. The NGA 
plan, according to Rector, does not contain the first two principles of reform. Rector argues that the NGA 
plan is flawed in four aspects: <li>it abandons the welfare reform goal of reducing illegitimacy; <li>it 
eliminates all work requirements for AFDC recipients; <li>it has a pervasive anti-marriage bias; and <li>it 
embodies the Clinton Administrations &quot;reform&quot; structure, which penalizes states that pursue efficient plans.</ul> Rector concludes that bogus reforms, such as the NGA proposal, reduce public pressure for change 
and thereby helps encourage the existing system. 12 pp. CONTACT: Chris OScannlain, The Heritage

William Beach, Heritage Foundation Visiting Fellow in Tax Analysis, warns that the debate between 
Congress and the President on reforming Medicaid has not paid enough attention to the effect of the 
program on state finances. He writes that if significant reforms in Medicaid are not enacted, state 
governments will face a major increase in spending and a heavy increase in the proportion of their 
projected revenues that they must dedicate to the program. Beach shows that the cost of Medicaid to the 
federal government has grown at double-digit rates in recent years. Congressional Budget Office 
projections show annual federal Medicaid costs doubling by the year 2002. According to Beach there will 
be an estimated shift of $47.4 billion in mandated Medicaid spending from the federal government to state 
governments over the next seven years. He believes that states will respond in one of three ways:<br><ol><li>by 
enacting dramatic tax increases; <li>by reducing state spending on education, infrastructure, law 
enforcement, and other important state functions; or <li>by some combination of the first two.</ol> The National 
Association of State Budget Officers claims that Medicaid spending has already doubled from 
approximately 10 percent to 20 percent as a share of overall state spending since 1987. 5 pp. CONTACT:

<P>
David Tuerck, Executive Director of the Beacon Hill Institute, James Angelini, Professor of Accounting 
and Taxation at Suffolk University, and William OBrien, Resident Scholar at the Beacon Hill Institute, 
argue that the method by which the government funds welfare programs causes the taxpayer to have no 
incentive to take interest in how his money is spent. The taxpayer (who is a potential donor to charitable, 
nonprofit organizations) has no clear idea of how much of his tax money makes it to a welfare recipient, so 
he has no control over the tax dollar and therefore, argue Angelini, OBrien, and Tuerck, over the behavior 
of the welfare recipient. The authors propose that the same funds that now directly flow into government 
offices can instead flow into private charitable organizations. The tax credit they propose will allow 
taxpayers to deduct 100% of their contributions to eligible charities to up to 25% of their federal tax 
liability. This gives the taxpayer/donor control over where his dollar is spent. Angelini, OBrien, and 
Tuerck predict that such a tax credit will cause new organizations to respond to the increased opportunities 
presented to them. They conclude that competition will lead to efficiency and charitable organizations will 
be more innovative and successful than government in providing social services. 165 pp. CONTACT:

<P>
This study, by John Berthoud, Vice President of the Alexis de Toqueville Institution, reveals that if every 
item in the National Education Associations (NEA) Legislative Program for the 104th Congress were 
enacted, federal spending would increase by at least $702 billion annually. The study uses data on 
legislative proposals compiled by the National Taxpayers Union Foundation in their BillTally tracking 
system. The spending estimates for the different proposals come from non-partisan sources such as the 
Congressional Budget Office. One of the findings in this report is that the NEAs spending priorities are 
heavily skewed towards elderly Americans, despite NEAs claim that it is an educational organization with 
a primary focus on schools and children. The study finds that for each dollar in new spending on children 
and education that the NEA proposes (over $24 billion annually), it advocates $5.24 in new spending on 
Social Security. The report also claims that the taxes to fund the NEA agenda are probably politically 
impractical. According to the report, the NEA would need over thirteen times as much in taxes as was 
raised by the 1993 budget package. Berthoud points out, &quot;no organization that advocates this massive 
expansion of federal spending and probably massive increase in deficits can claim to be helping children. 
This agenda will break the financial back of Americas future generations.&quot; 31 pp.  CONTACT: The Alexis

Chester Finn, John M. Olin Fellow at the Hudson Institute, and Bruno Manno, Senior Fellow in the 
Education Policy Studies Program at the Hudson Institute, examine the state of American higher education. 
They point out that although American education has grown in the last fifty years in scale, wealth, allure, 
and stature, it is encountering public disapproval and consumer resistance. Productivity concerns, 
according to Finn and Manno, had been ignored because a college education use to pay off so well in the 
job market. Today, however, that payoff appears to be decreasing while the costs of higher education are 
increasing more quickly than inflation. Furthermore, funding is decreasing, consumers are becoming more 
conscious of costs, and the number of students available for enrollment is less. Finn and Manno claim that 
in order to solve these problems,  higher education must have a greater concern for productivity and a 
willingness to serve customers. They argue that administrators should cut costs, establish tougher entry 
requirements, and concentrate on serious academic subjects. However, they concede, the public will have 
to push them to do so. 16 pp. CONTACT: Hudson Institute, Herman Kahn Center, P.O. Box 26-919,

districts to pay for the pensions of union officials. They center on a case in the state of Rhode Island where 
officials of the National Education Association-Rhode Island, and the Rhode Island Federation of Teachers 
benefited from legislation enacted in 1987 which extended the benefits of the states retirement system to 
full-time employees of organizations representing employees of the state and/or any political subdivision 
thereof for the purpose of collective bargaining. Lieberman and Haar also cover the ensuing legal battle 
since the details of the legislation were exposed in the press and subsequently repealed in the Rhode Island 
legislature. They conclude by calling for the prohibition of this practice in other states and encourage 
school boards and state legislatures to adopt safeguards. 14 pp.  CONTACT: Social Philosophy and Policy

Raymond Keating, Chief Economist at SBSC, criticizes the federal government Superfund program by 
documenting the massive costs and inefficiencies of the Superfund program, which was designed to help 
clean up hazardous waste sites across the country. Keating illustrates how only 18 percent of the worst 
waste sites have been cleaned up at a combined government/private sector cost of roughly $90 million. 
According to Keating, Superfund turned essentially local or state problems into national problems and 
granted the inefficient federal bureaucracy jurisdiction over them. Keating offers a three-step reform 
process for Superfund:<br><ol><li> repeal the retroactive liability for all actions taken before 1987, use science-
based risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis to determine required clean up remedies, and cap the 
number of Superfund sites to gain some control over costs; <li> to bring fairness and common sense, repeal 
the strict, retroactive, and joint and several liability schemes altogether, and only assign liability to 
individuals and businesses who broke the law, and <li> eventually abolish Superfund entirelywaste sites 
are a local problem, not federal.</ol>  28 pp. CONTACT: Small Business Survival Foundation, 1320 18th

<P>
This issue of EPA Watch features an article on the conflict between EPA and industry over EPAs efforts to 
expand the breadth and depth of the toxic release inventory (TRI) and the controversial issue of material 
accounting. The TRI is the list of chemicals whose emissions certain industries must report annually to 
EPA. EPA is proposing to nearly double the size of this list. Material accounting would require industries 
to report not only emissions, but also the amounts of a certain chemical used at key intervals in the 
manufacturing process. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce led a group of forty companies and trade 
associations in blasting the proposal in a letter to EPA Administrator Carol Browner. They claimed the goal 
of TRI is to provide information to the public so that they can make informed decisions about risk. 
Chemical use is not relative information because it is not a good indicator of risk. On top of that, EPA does 
not have the legislative authority to collect and make public chemical use information. This issue is even 
controversial in the agency itself, as many EPA scientists argue that better use can be made of resources by 
concentrating on more serious risks. 8 pp.  CONTACT: EPA Watch, 14140-L Parke Long Court, Chantilly,

Increasing incarceration rates since 1980 have led to a projected 294 percent increase in the prison 
population of the state of Pennsylvania. The funding for the states corrections department has grown at a 
similar rate. In order to afford new prison construction costs, The Commonwealth Foundation calls for 
privatizing the states prisons. According to this report, privatization saves money because government is 
simply not capable of delivering, running, and regulating services either as efficiently or as effectively as 
private firms. Various studies show that prison privatization would likely save at least 10 percent per year 
in operations costs. This report illustrates how private prisons save operational funds and construction 
costs. It is also shown that private prisons are constitutionally sound. The report concludes that 
privatization of the construction and operation of the new prisons needed in Pennsylvania as of the year 
2000, as well at the operations of existing prisons, is exceptionally attractive financially, and maybe even a 
necessity in times of financial belt-tightening. 20 pp. CONTACT: The Commonwealth Foundation, 600 N.

<I><font size=3>Briefing, Pacific Research Institute</FONT></I><font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">

<P> 
Vice-President of Research at the Pacific Research Institute Steven Hayward looks at the effects of punitive 
damages  in civil litigation, which are demanded in 27 percent of all cases where they are conceivably 
recoverable. Hayward uses lawsuit filing data to show that business and government defendants are four 
times as likely as an individual defendant to face a lawsuit that demands punitive damages. Lawsuits with 
punitive damage demands take one-third longer to resolve than suits without them. Punitive damages tilt 
the playing field towards the demanding parties, according to Hayward, and increase out-of-court 
settlement amounts. Hayward provides evidence against studies that claim the risk of receiving an adverse 
punitive damage judgment is remote. Closer scrutiny of data shows that the probability of punitive damage 
awards is vastly understated by such studies, partly because the data has been improperly qualified and

Ronald Utt, Visiting Fellow at the Heritage Foundation, examines what has been accomplished by 
Congress this session in closing unneeded and obsolete government agencies. He finds that Congress has 
done a respectable jobespecially in relation to past Congressesbut that there is much more to be done. 
They did better than most observers expected, closing over 270 agencies, divisions, offices, and programs 
of various areas of the federal government. Utt also looks at what actions Congress took in 41 specific 
agencies recommended for termination by the Heritage Foundation. Excluding the five independent 
agencies that are not subject to the annual appropriations process, Utt found that Congresss record of the 
remaining 36 was: 13 agencies terminated and $3.6 billion saved over the next five years; funding for 12 
agencies substantially reduced by 10 percent or more) and $2.2 billion saved over five years; and no 
change or only limited change (funding cut by 10 percent or less) at 11 agencies and up to $40 million 
saved over the next five years. Utt also shows that of the 11 agencies not significantly reduced in funding 
terminated, all but onethe Franklin Delano Roosevelt Memorial Commission, whose funding was 
tripledsaw their funding either modestly reduced or frozen at 1995 levels. Despite Congresss proven 
effort to reduce government waste, Utt points out, President Clinton opposed many of these efforts by 
vetoing five of the appropriations bills put forth by Congress. He concludes by outlining termination and 
consolidation objectives for the FY 1997 budget. 20 pp. CONTACT: Chris OScannlain, The Heritage

Paul Grant, an attorney in Parker, Colorado, examines the importance of citizen initiatives in that state. He 
reports recent instances of Colorados elected and appointed government officials retaliating against 
initiatives that they are not happy with, and argues that Colorados Secretary of State, General Assembly 
and Supreme Court have combined to weaken the power of initiative. According to Grant, this has been 
done through burdensome new regulations, petty and substantial interference from the Secretary of State, 
legislative attacks on the initiative process, and Colorado Supreme Court interferences. Overall the 
initiative process has been made more difficult, expensive and less effective. Grant looks at the methods 
and motives of attackers of the initiative process, and he considers legal analysis which might be useful in 
resisting and reversing damage caused to this &quot;vital check on runaway government power.&quot; 10 pp.

In this comprehensive study, Austin Fulk, Research Associate, and Stuart Nolan, Visiting Fellow at Capital 
Research Center, surveyed 1993 corporate contributions from the 250 largest American corporations to 
cover 300 nonprofit public interest and special interest advocacy groups. Using available corporate and IRS 
data, Fulk and Nolan were able to identify over $36 million in contributions by 166 corporations to groups 
across the political spectrum. They found that for every $1.00 that corporations gave to conservative and 
free market policy groups, $4.07 was given to liberal groups favoring increased government spending and 
regulation. The book also uncovers a development in public affairs during the Clinton Administration: 
Although many corporations are downsizing their operations, some of them are supporting nonprofit 
advocacy groups whose lobbying activities promote big government and undermine the free enterprise 
system. The guide also lists specific grants made by Forbes 250 companies, and includes a cross-reference 
to easily check which companies fund which advocacy groups. 193 pp. CONTACT: Capital Research

<b>CIR Wins Appeal Challenging Racial Preferences</b><p> CIR won a major victory in March when an unanimous panel of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals held 
that the university of Texas Law Schools use of racial preferences in student admissions is unconstitutional. CIR represents Cheryl Hopwood and Douglas Carvell, white applicants to the 1992 incoming class of the University of Texas Law School who were denied admission on the basis of their race despite their superior qualifications. In its ruling, the Fifth Circuit declared that diversity is not a 
compelling state interest that would justify the use of racial preferences. The Court stated that [w]ithin the general principles of the fourteenth Amendment, the use of race in admissions for diversity in higher education contradicts, rather than furthers, the aims of equal protection. Diversity fosters, rather than 
minimizes, the use of race. It treats minorities as a group, rather than as individuals. The Fifth Circuit held that Justice Powells opinion in Board of Regents v. Bakke, in which he advocated the consideration of race 
to achieve diversity, never represented the view of a majority of the Supreme Court and, in light of more recent Supreme Court rulings, did not justify the law school race-based admissions program. The Fifth Circuit held further that the government may employ racial preferences only as a means of redressing past 
discrimination by a particular government unitin this case, UT Law School. Racial preferences may not be used to redress alleged discrimination by entire educational systems.  <p>
 
<b>Update on CIR's Case Against HUD Officials</b><p>CIR is representing the Berkeley 3, residents of Berkeley, CA who were targets of a prolonged 
investigation by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.  In response to an administrative complaint filed by a so-called fair housing organization that the residents exercise of their First Amendment rights to protest the governments proposed conversion of a nearby hotel to a homeless shelter constituted discrimination, HUD conducted a lengthy investigation of the residents activities.  CIR filed suit on behalf of the Berkeley 3 against various HUD officers, in both their official and individual capacities, last May.  <p>
 
The Court denied the defendants motion to dismiss on the ground that the complaint failed to state a violation of the First Amendment and that the individual defendants are protected by qualified immunity.  The Court found the defendants arguments that no investigation can violate the First Amendment striking 
in its audacity, and concluded that it would be premature to resolve the issue of qualified immunity solely on the allegations of the complaint.  The Court did grant defendants motion to dismiss plaintiffs injunctive relief claims, but granted plaintiffs leave to replead (which they have done). <p>

<b>Defenders Tells State It Cannot "Have Its Cake and Eat It Too."</b><p>
Defenders has argued its Motion for Summary Judgment and Opposition to the States Motion to Dismiss 
before Judge Preece of the Ninth Judicial District in Clearwater County, Minnesota.  James Peternell owns 
2/3rd interest in an 112-acre Rice Slough, which the state, pursuant to legislation passed in 1979, classified 
as a public water.  That classification did not, in an of itself, however, change the rights of the property 
owner.  In 1994, the state had criminally prosecuted James Peternell for attempting to exclude from his 
portion of the Rice Slough an uninvited member of the public (who later turned out to be an undercover 
DNR agent) and for leaving duck decoys out overnight on public water.  Although the jury acquitted Mr. 
Peternell of both criminal counts in 1995, Defenders brought its lawsuit alleging that as a result of the 
prosecution, Peternell has lost his right to exclude others from his property in violation of the Fifth 
Amendment.  In response to this lawsuit for compensation, the state has now changed its position.  During 
oral arguments, the state agreed with Defenders that Peternell can exclude members of the public from his 
property.  Defenders is seeking a court order so holding which will force the state to obey the Constitution 
and prevent any further unwarranted criminal prosecutions of Mr. Peternell.   <p>

<b>Sixth Circuit Asks Feds to Respond to MSLF Rehearing Petition</b><p> 
The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit has ordered the U.S. Forest Service to respond to a petition 
by MSLF fro a rehearing en banc.  MSLFs petition follows the decision by a three judge panel that private 
property in Michigan may be regulated by the Forest Service as a wilderness despite the provision of the 
Wilderness Act of 1964 that only federal land may be classified as wilderness. 
<p> 
Lake front property owners in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan have been told by the U.S. Forest Service 
that their rights to use the entire surface of Crooked Lakea right recognized by Michigan Lawcan be 
denied by the Forest Service since it owns property abutting the southern portion of the Lake. The Forest 
Service claims the Property Clause of the Constitution gives it such authority over private property. 
<p> 
<b>Appeals Court Hears MSLF Challenge to Clinton Tax</b><p> 
A potentially precedent-setting challenge to President Clintons 1993 tax legislation, contending that the 
tax on transportation fuels violates the U.S. Constitution, was heard recently by the U.S. Court of Appeals 
for the Tenth Circuit.  In oral arguments before the three-judge panel, the Wyoming Trucking Association 
asserted that because the transportation fuel tax increase failed to originate in the House of Representatives 
(the House has passed a BTU tax), it violates the Constitutions Origination Clause. 
<p> 
The case is on appeal from federal district court in Wyoming where the Wyoming Trucking Associations 
lawsuit was dismissed when the court held that it had no jurisdiction to hear the case.  The district court 
ruled that any challenge to federal tax liability must first be heard by the Commissioner of the Internal 
Revenue Service.  The Association claims a hearing before the IRS would be futile since it cannot rule 
on challenges to the constitutionality of a tax.

<b>NELF Brief Aids in Major Win For Massachusetts CPAs.</b><p> 
In a case with national implications, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has ruled that the state can 
constitutionally prohibit unlicensed accountants (non-CPAs) from using any language that might mislead 
the public as to their qualifications. The court also held that the state can bar such unlicensed accountants 
from preparing and distributing audits and financial reports to clients or third parties. 
<p> 
The decision involved Mr. Volin, an unlicensed accountant supported by a national association of such 
people.  Volin argued that the First Amendment prohibited the state from preventing non-CPAs from 
claiming the title accountant.  He also claimed the right to use adjectives such as qualified, 
experienced and independent, although he was not licensed by any state or recognized national 
accrediting organization. 
<p> 
But the court agreed with an amicus brief filed by NELF which argued that the states rules promote the 
public interest by protecting clients, financial institutions, suppliers and others from the consequences of 
inaccurate or misleading financial data.  NELFs brief pointed out that every state in the nation has had 
such regulations on the books for decades and that a decision in Volins favor would cause financial 
institutions and suppliers to raise questions about the reliability of financial data regarding the states 
businesses which would harm their ability to engage in interstate and international trade. 
<p> 
The court held that Volin could use the bare word accountant to describe himself, but it barred use of 
modifiers which might imply licensure or special qualifica-tions, and it barred him from distributing 
financial reports.  By upholding the states rules, the court set back national efforts to weaken regulation of 
the accounting profession. 
<p> 
<b>NELF Supreme Court Brief Challenges Expansion of Corporate Liability Under 
Federal Pension Law.</b><p> 
Spink v. Lockheed Corporation involves Lockheeds effort to reduce its defense workforce as a result of 
post-Cold War cutbacks in the defense budget.  One element of Lockheeds effort was to offer workers a 
generous package of additional pension benefits if they agreed to take voluntary early retirement.  Sensibly 
enough, Lockheed coupled that offer with a requirement that workers who accepted enhanced retirement 
benefits must wave possible claims against Lockheed arising from termination of employment.  Lockheed 
added this proviso to protect itself against the increasingly common practice of workers accepting 
enhanced retirement benefits and then suing their former employer claiming violations of the age 
discrimination or other employment-related laws. 
<p> 
Spink refused to sign the waiver and so did not take early retirement. Instead he sued Lockheed, claiming 
that coupling enhanced benefits with a required waiver violated ERISA, the federal pension protection law. 
Spink argued that Lockheed was a fiduciary with respect to assets held under its retirement plan and could 
not use the promise of increased benefits to induce recipients to grant waivers that would protect it. While a 
District Court dismissed Spinks claim, the Court of Appeals in San Francisco reversed. 
<p> 
The case raises two key issues: 1) was the decision to award increased benefits in return for a waiver a 
prohibited transaction in violation of ERISA; and 2) is a corporate plan sponsor an ERISA fiduciary. 
Since Lockheed fully addressed the first issue, NELF only discussed the fiduciary issue. That issue matters, 
because, under ERISA, fiduciaries are subject to civil suits for compensatory damages and attorneys fees, 
while non-fiduciaries are generally subject only to regulatory orders to undo improper actions. 
<p> 
NELFs brief argued that it is irrational to treat plan sponsors as fiduciaries. Corporations are responsible to 
shareholders, not to retirees. While they must obey ERISA and other laws, they cannot put retirees 
interests above their own, as fiduciaries must. The history of ERISA recognizes that plan sponsors and 
fiduciaries, i.e. fund trustees, have different responsibilities. Consistent with pre-existing trust law, under 
ERISA fiduciaries are fully subject to civil suit, while corporations and those that aid them, such as 
accountants and third party benefit administrators, are subject only to regulatory constraints. 
<p> 
<b>NELF Files Amicus Brief in First Circuit Superfund Case.</b><p> 
NELF has filed an amicus brief with the Court of Appeals in a case in which the government seeks to make 
a company pay millions of dollars in Superfund cleanup costs without a chance to defend itself. United 
States v. Cooper Industries involves a Massachusetts site polluted 50 years ago. The Friedlands later 
bought the land and leased it to Cooper Industries. As part of a standard lease, Cooper promised to 
indemnify the Friedlands for costs which they might incur from its activities. Later, after passage of 
CERCLA, the Superfund law, the government sued the Fried lands and Cooper because they owned or 
worked on polluted land. The cleanup estimate was $42 million, with Cooper 22% responsible and the 
Friedlands 29% responsible. 
Then the government hit upon the idea of having the Friedlands use the indemnity provision to pass 
through cleanup costs. Although the clause predated passage of CERCLA, a judge held that it applied to 
CERCLA-related costs. The government then made the Friedlands the proverbial offer they could not 
refuse. If the Friedlands stipulated they were liable for the full $42 million in damages, the government 
would collect the money from indemnity proceeds, i.e., from Cooper. Thus the Friedlands agreed to an 
enormous fine so long as someone else would pay it.  Furthermore, since Cooper had to pay the money 
under the indemnity, not under CERCLA, it could not use any CERCLA defenses or argue that the costs 
were unreasonable or unnecessary. 
<p> 
Obviously, this is grossly unfair to Cooper which must pay millions of dollars in cleanup costs without a 
chance to protect itself. It will also lead to waste in administering CERCLA cleanups. By using the back 
door of indemnity, government can avoid having to prove its costs are reasonable.  Without that check, 
costs will continue to spiral.  A decision on Coopers appeal is likely by summer.

<b>PACIFIC LEGAL FOUNDATION </b>
<p> 
<b>First Amendment Right to Language Diversity?</b><p> 
As a taxpayer, and ultimately the employer of government workers, do you have the right to set 
reasonable rules concerning the operation of the agencies you underwrite with tax dollars?  Conversely, do 
government workers have a constitutional right to promote their individual agenda by disregarding 
reasonable workplace policies?  More specifically, should state employees be allowed to drag their bosses 
into federal court because they are required to carry out their responsibilities in English?  These 
fundamental questions are at issue in a case in which Pacific Legal Foundation recently asked the U.S. 
Supreme Court to strike down a U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling Yniguez v. Arizonans for 
Official Language that the free speech right of the public employees are offended by requiring them to 
conduct their jobs in the nations predominant languageEnglish. Should the U.S. Supreme Court accept 
this case, PLF will argue, among other things, that government bureaucrats have no right to turn every 
workplace disagreement into a federal case.  
 <p>
Last October the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals declared unconstitutional Arizonas Official Language 
amendment to the state constitution.  Enacted by Arizona voters in 1988, it declared English the states 
official language and requires the state and all political subdivisions to act in English and in no other 
language.  The amendment applies to all state government employees during the performance of their 
government business.  It is not and outright ban against conversing in a language other than English.

<b>Malibu Declares Moratorium on Constitution</b><p> 
In 1988, Diana Merritt-Shriner and her husband bought 16 acres in Malibu, California, with the intent of 
dividing the lot into three parcels.  They spent three years paying off the loans and formulating their plans 
to build one house on each of the lots.  The county granted tentative parcel approval of the plan in June 
1990, and they subsequently were granted permits buy the Coastal Commission. 
<p> 
All was going well until the creation off the City of Malibu in 1991, when the new city leaders passed a 
law imposing a moratorium on all new development so that it could create and adopt a general plan and 
zoning ordinances.  This turn of events left the Shriners with about $75,000 of incurred expenses and a 16-
acre plot on which no development would be allowed under the terms of the moratorium. 
<p> 
Hard-nosed city bureaucrats denied the Shriners permit request despite state and county rules that would 
have allowed for an exception under unfortunate circumstances.  Although the Shriners land was located 
in a residential neighborhood, the city designated the area as potential open space or parkland even though 
it had no funds with which to purchase the property for those uses!  Furthermore, the county placed a 
Road and Water Assessment Bond against the property in the amount of $279,000 for which the 
Shriners are liable, even though there have not been any water or road impacts since no homes exist on the 
property. 
<p> 
PLF argued to the California Court of Appeal that under circumstances like these, city bureaucrats must not 
abuse their powers in a way that imposes economic hardship on property owners when it is clear that no 
public health, safety, and welfare concerns are being advanced.

<b>36 Members of Congress Support Florida Suit on Immigration Costs</b><p> 
On behalf of itself and a bipartisan group of five United States Senators (Mack, Graham, DAmato, 
Hutchison, and Feinstein) and 34 Representatives, WLF filed a brief urging the U.S. Supreme Court to hear 
the State of Floridas lawsuit against the federal government in Chiles v. United States.  Florida brought the 
suit to compel the federal government to compensate Florida for the fiscal burdens resulting from the 
federal governments failure to enforce its own immigration laws adequately. 
<p> 
WLFs brief focuses on the fiscal effects of federal mandates upon states to provide education of illegal 
aliens without federal assistance to offset those expenses.  According to WLFs brief, if the federal 
government fails to control illegal immigration adequately, the result is a massive unfunded mandate 
imposed upon the states to provide for the immigrants education and medical care.  Based on the Supreme 
Courts 1992 decision in New York v. United States, WLF argues that although the federal government can 
create incentives for a state to provide such services, it lacks the power to hijack state resources unilaterally 
in this manner. The constitutionality of the federal governments failure to provide reimbursement is not 
just the subject of Floridas suit but of pending litigation brought by other states across the country:  
<p> 
<b>Miranda Decision Superseded by Statute, 
WLF Contends</b><p> 
WLF filed a brief in a Utah bank robbery case, United States v. Nafka, arguing that incriminating 
statements by defendants must be admitted into evidence even if their Miranda right were technically 
violated. WLF pointed out the Miranda has been superseded in federal prosecutions by 18 U.S.C. 3501, 
which provides that statements shall be admissible as evidence if the confession was otherwise voluntary.  
In such cases, according to 3501, the totality of the circumstances should be examined by the trial court.  
Although the U.S. Justice Department has generally failed to invoke 3501 since its enactment in 1968, the 
United States Attorney prosecuting the Utah case has asked the court to consider WLFs arguments. 
<p> 
<b>Apple Growers Ask Supreme Court to 
Hear Appeal</b><p> 
On seventh anniversary of a controversial 60 Minutes broadcast that portrayed apples treated with Alar 
as carcinogenic, a group of Washington State apple growers asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear their 
suit against CBS for falsity of the broadcast.  The growers, represented by WLF, suffered losses of over 
$75 million from the broadcast, which called Alar  the most potent cancer-causing agent in the food 
supply.  Alar is an EPA-approved growth regulator for apples; according to eminent scientists, there is no 
reliable evidence that Alar causes cancer in humans. In fact, because fruits and vegetables contain 
anticarcinogens, eating them - including those treated with pesticides - is a good way to reduce cancer risk.

<B><FONT SIZE=4>Understanding Corporate Government Relations
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<hr><P>
<font size=3>


	After nearly 34 years in the corporate world, I welcomed the opportunity to join <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a> after the 1994 elections, when the prospect of a conservative revolution presented an 
irresistible second career challenge. I had always respected the conservative movement and 
supported its mission, even when I found my business colleagues on the other side of an issue.
	In my old job in the corporate community, I found that conservative analysts and activists are 
often suspicious of business. Indeed, in the interest of earning &quot;business value&quot; for 
their companies and shareholders, corporate government affairs offices often put narrow 
economic interests over the broader philosophical or political objectives that motivate 
conservatives. The business community cares less about ideology than about finding the power 
center and lining up advocates on its key issues. This may translate into support for a piece of 
compromise legislation that lifts a burden, lessens a cost, or lowers a barrier, even if it isnt the 
proposal conservatives took to the table.<p>
	The business communitys pragmatic approach to policy making is not very inspiring, but it can 
bring closure and progress on its objectives. My corporate experiences suggest that sometimes 
the beauty of an idea crowds out the importance of strategically implementing a focused plan to 
achieve your objectives. This most certainly is not to suggest compromise on principle, but 
rather the need for a system that is acutely aware of its environment, regularly takes stock of how 
its agenda items are proceeding, and makes necessary adjustments to its priorities, goals, and 
strategies. <p>
Although the commercial instinct for closure and moving on to the next priority often 
serves business interests business interests well enough, it does not always serve them best. 
When it began to appear in the fall of 1994 that conservatives could seriously increase their 
presence in the House and Senate, those positioned to take over the new leadership positions 
were proclaiming a sea change rollback of government.<p>
	The reality of governing, however, dictates that conservatives cannot expect to reform 40 years 
of liberal policies overnight: reinventing government is a slow, deliberate process. Take 
Superfund, for example. Business had pushed hard for meaningful reform of the burdensome 
program and at long last, in 1994, had a bill in committee that was acceptable, though not ideal. 
But conservative senators, sensing the probability of having a majority in Congress after the 
elections, defeated the compromise legislation, promising a &quot;better&quot; bill after the 
election. Business listened to its ideological friends and acted against its instinct for closure, 
deciding to wait for the &quot;better&quot; bill. Because business quickly adjusted to the 
changing political environment and acted against its natural instincts, it will likely see that 
&quot;better&quot; bill enacted some time this year.<p>
	Despite rhetorical victories and the perception that our ideological friends have taken over, many 
point out that the rollback theme has not substantively advanced either the conservative or 
business reform agendas. But should we realistically have expected to overhaul decades worth of 
bureaucratic growth overnight?. Insufficient strength in Congress, special interest tactics, and a 
demagogic White House have thwarted usso far.<p>
	The business and policy communities will  eventually see key components of their agendas 
enacted, however, if they make timely adjustments to strategy, focus on the most important 
goals, and a develop a keen awareness of changing legislative and poltical environments. From 
my perspective, we can have more success advancing the conservative agenda in 1996 if we 
learn to focus our energies on the most important goals by adapting more quickly and shrewdly 
to this volatile political environment, as business did with Superfund reform.<p>
	Management guru and author Tom Peters has said that even the best-run companies are only 18 
months from failure. In order to stay competitive, well-run companies gear their systems to 
anticipate changes in their environments and adjust plans accordingly. Policy making (or 
unmaking) is a complicated task worthy of the best thought and strategic planning. 
Conservatives need to sharpen their skills at anticipating changes in the debate, adjusting our 
marketing and message delivery, and building strategic coalitions. The movement may not have 
the luxury of 18 months to consolidate the revolutionfocus and closure are critical.<p>

Beware of Deploying U.S. Peacekeepers on the Golan Heights,

No. 1066, The Heritage Foundation</FONT>
<P>
Thomas Moore, Deputy Director of Foreign Policy and
Defense Studies at The Heritage Foundation, and James Phillips,
Heritage Senior Policy Analyst, warn against the possibility that
the Clinton Administration might bridge the peace negotiation
gap between Israel and Syria by offering U.S. peacekeeping forces
to monitor compliance with any agreement that might come about.
Moore and Phillips offer several reasons why such a deployment
of U.S. forces should not occur, among them:
<ol><li> the Golan Heights present a more formidable peacekeeping
challenge than the existingU.S. peacekeeping mission on the Sinai Peninsula;
<li> terrorism would pose a threat to U.S. troops; 
<li> U.S.-Israel relations may be adversely affected;
<li> the cost to, and  drain on, U.S. forces.
</ol>
They call for Congress to press the Clinton Administration to rule out foreign aid
to Syria as a sweetener for a peace agreement and to maintain pressure on Syria
to halt its support of terrorism. Moore and Phillips conclude that Congress should
open debate on the Golan peacekeeping issue before it is presented with another
<I>fait accompli</I> like Haiti or Bosnia. 9 pp. CONTACT: Chris

<p>
International Republican Institute
<P>
The Cuba Transition Commitee, chaired by Jeb Bush
and composed of 44 Cuban American and U.S.-Cuba policy experts,
has produced a resource guide that provides recommended initiatives
for a three phase process for a Cuban transition to democracy
and suggests what the U.S. might do to encourage such a transition.
The guide, which also lists 66 non-governmental organizations
and 37 foundations that could play a role in the process, will
be distributed to Cuban dissidents on the island, exiles in the
U.S. and abroad, U.S. government officials, and others. 90 pp.

<B>Unfunded Federal Mandates in Transportation: The
Case for Unilateral Devolution, <BR>
</B>by Tom McClintock
<P>
The Claremont Institute
<P>
Tom McClintock, Director, Economic and Regulatory
Affairs, at the Golden State Center for Policy Studies of the
Claremont Institute, illustrates the burden that unfunded federal
mandates have on the State of California.  McClintock suggests
that California might consider forgoing federal funds and not
be obligated to the mandates attached to them, pointing out that
while the federal assistance for programs is massive-so are the
costs of the mandates. McClintock argues that although the state
would forfeit revenues far beyond the unfunded cost of federal
mandates, there would be enormous savings from the more efficient
application of remaining revenues toward truly high-priority public
objectives. For example, McClintock concludes that if California
kicked the federal government out of state transportation policy,
it would lose $2.3 billion in federal funds. However, California
would save $1.9 billion in unnecessary mandated expenditures.
By recouping a portion of federal highway taxes, the missing $400,000
could be transferred from the federal government to the state
without an increase in the total tax burden. 12 pp. CONTACT: The

<B>Restructuring America's Water Industry: Comparing
Investor-Owned and Government-Owned Water Systems, </B>
by Kathy Neal, <BR>
Patrick Maloney, Jonas Marson &amp; Tamer Francis
</font><P>
Reason Foundation
<P>
The performance of investor-owned water companies
is compared with government-owned water companies in California
in order to gauge the potential benefits of restructuring the
industry. The study focuses on tax subsidization, the cost of
capital, water charges, operating costs, investment income, and
capital expenditures. Among the results of an analysis of the
data are: investor-owned water companies provide comparable water
services to consumers at the same price as government-owned water
companies even though they pay taxes and do not receive extra
income; government-owned water companies receive generous tax
subsidies that otherwise could be used to lower taxes or fund
other government projects with higher priorities; the net cost
of capital is higher for government-owned water companies than
for investor-owned water companies; investor-owned companies are
substantially more efficient in their operation than government-owned
water companies; and government-owned water companies receive
a substantial amount of non-operating income from excess cash
balances and investments. The authors conclude that the decision
to have government entities provide water to consumers should
be reconsidered, since investor-owned companies can provide this
same function at the same cost without subsidies or tax-exemptions.

Washington Institute

Washington Institute Senior Research Fellow Elaine
Ramel Davis updates the status of regulatory reform in Washington
State. Davis summarizes the accomplishments of the Regulatory
Reform Act and compares them with the Institute's earlier recommendations.
Davis believes that the RRA was a good start to the process of
reducing the amount of government regulation in Washington state.
However she also illustrates that while the RRA &quot;slows the
flow&quot; of new and increasingly onerous state regulations,
more needs to be done to end overburdensome regulations. 5 pp.

Raymond Keating, Chief Economist with the Small Business
Survival Foundation, reviews the responsibilities, tactics and
strategies, and budget of the FDA, as well as the administration's
impact on entrepreneurs. Keating recommends the following reforms:
<ol><li>scrapping the FDA in favor of a smaller agency geared toward
safety and education;<br><li>subjecting manufacturers and approval
enterprises  to the incentives of a sound legal system;<br><li>allowing
manufacturers to distribute information regarding off-label uses
of drugs, such as independent studies and journal articles;<br><li>
annual congressional scrutiny of the federal agency's enforcement
powers, as well as its processes and standards for determining
what products fall under its jurisdiction;<br><li>negotiating and
entering into agreements with other nations to recognize each
other's drug and medical device approvals;<br><li>enhancing incentives
for investment in dynamic industries, like pharmaceuticals and
medical devices. 25 pp.</ol><br>

<B>Hazardous to our Health? FDA Regulation of Health
Care Products, </B>edited
by Robert Higgs
<P>
The Independent Institute


<P>
Robert Higgs, Research Director, The Independent
Institute, Ronald Hansen, Associate Dean for Academic Affairs
at the William E. Simon Graduate School of Business Administration,
and  Paul Rubin, Professor of Economics at Emory University, examine
FDA's regulation of health care products. The book's introduction
and afterword place the activities of FDA into a larger perspective
by illustrating how the agency acquired its vast powers, how it
uses those powers, and what harm caused by FDA could be diminished
by abolishing the agency. Other chapters argue that FDA, largely
regarded as a scientific body devoted to protecting public health,
is in fact a highly politicized body, often harming the public
health. Another chapter focuses on the restrictions that FDA places
on the marketing of drugs. According to the authors, these advertising
restrictions assume that consumers should be treated as if they
are unsophisticated and easily misled, and that doctors are not
reliable judges of medicines. The authors conclude that the root
cause of the harm caused by FDA regulations arise from the enormous
discretion Congress has given the agency. 113 pp.  CONTACT: The

<B>The Truth About Income Inequality,</B>
<BR>
by John Hinderaker and Scott Johnson
<P>
Center for the American Experiment
<P>
John Hinderaker and Scott Johnson, attorneys in Minneapolis,
examine liberal claims that there is a widening income inequality
and a disappearing middle class in America. They illustrate that
these claims have been based, almost universally, on biased analyses
which manipulate and distort the underlying economic facts. Overall,
they conclude that basic economic data does not support the gloomy
picture promoted by liberals. Furthermore, Hinderaker and Johnson
write that the data shows that the last 25 years does not represent
an upward or downward trend for middle-and lower-income Americans.
The data also does not suggest that higher taxes, increased government
spending, or hyper-regulation of the economy will benefit middle-income
or lower-income citizens. 18 pp. CONTACT: Center for the American

<B>The Value of Fringe Benefits and Tenure in Wisconsin:
Public Versus Private, <BR>
</B>by Richard Cebula
<P>
Wisconsin Policy Research Institute
<P>
In this study, Richard Cebula, an economist at Georgia
Tech, examines the differentials in the levels of fringe benefits
provided to full-time workers between the public and private sectors
in Wisconsin. He also examines the value of tenure or its equivalent
in the Wisconsin public school system at the primary and secondary
levels. Cebula examines each major category of fringe benefits
and then all benefits combined, concluding that the overall fringe-benefit
value appears to be 36% higher in the public sector than in the
private sector. 16 pp. CONTACT: Wisconsin Policy Research Institute,

No. 552, The Heritage Foundation

Steve Hanke, Professor of Applied Economics at Johns

compares the currency policies of Mexico and Argentina. Argentina,
according to Hanke, appears to have committed itself to maintaining
a stable currency. Mexico's monetary policy, on the other hand,
is in disarray. Hanke points out that Mexicans have called for
a sound peso, but that politicians from the three major parties
and their technocrat advisors have not been able to agree on an
exchange rate policy. So far Argentina's currency reforms seem
to be working. Hanke lays out several specific areas where Mexico
can learn and benefit from Argentina's experience. 11 pp.  CONTACT:

<B>Why Colorado Should Drop out of Goals 2000, <BR>
</B>by Sheldon Richman
<P>
<I>Issue Paper</I>
No. 2-96, The Independence Institute

<P>
Sheldon Richman, Policy Analyst at the Cato Institute,
examines each of Goals 2000's &quot;goals.&quot; He finds that
each goal will lead to more intrusion by the federal government,
and ultimately to federal control of curriculum, teaching practices,
and even facilities. Although Goals 2000 supposedly has &quot;no
power,&quot; and purports to build upon existing local efforts
to improve education, Richman argues that achievement of its goals
will require a drastic expansion of federal control. Richman also
shows that non-compliance with &quot;voluntary&quot; Goals 2000
directives could lead to litigation by the federal government
against states and local school districts. Richman focuses his
attention on Colorado's experience with Goals 2000 and the ominous
trends that followed its entry into the program. He found that
local educators and elected boards are losing their freedom to
set agendas, teach in ways they find effective, and monitor their
own progress. Richman concludes that although Goals 2000 is supposed
to bring excellence to schools, in reality it enacts increased
federal intrusion into families, communities, local school boards,
and state legislatures. 17 pp. CONTACT: Independence Institute,

at the Pacific Research Institute, and Natalie Williams, Director
of Education Affairs at the Claremont Institute, examine the fine
print in Goals 2000 and look at how this program will affect California's
public education system. Izumi and Williams find that Goals 2000
threatens to dominate and control state and local school leaders
by concentrating decision making power with a few un-elected officials
in Washington. They conclude that Goals 2000 represents &quot;devolution
in retreat&quot; and a step backward, toward the centralization

No. 138, Goldwater Institute

<P>
Tara Ellman, Education Consultant,
disputes some of the most widespread claims of those that oppose
school choice in this survey of participants in the Arizona School
Choice Trust (ASCT). ASCT is an organization that provides half-tuition
grants to low income parents who wish to send their children to
private schools. The survey found: low-income parents are willing
to subsidize the cost of their child's education; academics, not
religion, is the most frequently cited reason parents give for
choosing private schools; family structure  does not necessarily
dictate level of involvement in a child's education (about half
of the children participating in this program come from single
parent families); school choice programs do not result in &quot;white
flight&quot; (sixty-five percent of the participants are from
minority households); and school choice programs are not necessarily
expensive to administer (disbursement of funds for the ASCT is
done solely by volunteers, so that 100 percent of the money raised
can go to scholarships). 15 pp. CONTACT: Goldwater Institute,

<B>Restoring School Board Options on <BR>
Contracting Out, </B>by
Myron Lieberman
<P>
<I>Briefings </I>No.
1995-48, The Claremont Institute


<P>
Myron Lieberman, Chairman of the Education Policy
Institute, examines the issue of &quot;contracting out&quot; or
&quot;competitive contracting&quot; concerning school boards'
decisions on how to provide certain school services. For example,
a school board might have to make a decision whether to hire school
bus drivers and buy school buses, or to make a contract with a
transportation company to transport its students to and from school.
Lieberman shows that school boards and school board organizations
are unprepared to deal with such decisions because there has been
a massive union effort to restrict or eliminate school board freedom
to contract services. He illustrates this point by outliningthe
efforts that the National Education Association, the American
Federation of Teachers and the AFL-CIO have put forth to prevent
school boards from using the option to contract out school services,
in an effort to protect their own self interests. Lieberman concludes
that school boards &quot;should make every effort to retain or
to expand their authority to utilize contracting out.&quot; 17

John Berthoud, Vice President of The Alexis de Tocqueville

of Education and reveals that original supporters over-stated
the potential benefits and failed to acknowledge many potential
problems. Included is a compilation of promises and predictions
by supporters and opponents of the Department. For opponents,
it was found that many of their predictions have come true. According
to Berthoud these areas that proponents overstated the Departments'
benefits include:  overhead and bureaucracy; efficiency; local
control; cost; and values. 19 pp.  CONTACT: The Alexis de Tocqueville

Burton Folsom, Senior Fellow in Economic Education
with the Mackinac Center, reviews four grade school textbooks
on Michigan state history. The first two texts are written for
junior high or high school students; the other two are for fourth
graders. Folsom argues that a major problem in Michigan education
today is that the textbooks used to teach Michigan history are
often times filled with distorted interpretations and omit important
historical events, figures or trends. He rates the textbooks from
one to four stars based on each text's clarity, organization,
information, balance and lack of bias. 28 pp. CONTACT: Mackinac

<B>How to Dismantle the Interior Department, <BR>
</B>by Robert Nelson
<P>
Competitive Enterprise Institute
<P>
Robert Nelson, Senior Fellow in Environmental Studies
at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, proposes a radical reorganization
of the Interior Department and its functions, based on the following
four principles: 1) activities that can reasonably be carried
out in the private sector should be done privately; 2) activities
that mostly involve state and local concerns should be administered
by state and local governments; 3) the federal government should
limit its role to activities and concerns that involve major federal
interests and responsibilities; 4) administrative organization
at the federal level should place similar functions at the same
agency. According to Nelson, the result of applying these principles
would be the abolition of six of the ten current agencies located
within the Department of the Interior, and a sharp reduction in
the size of three others. Nelson estimates that the proposed reorganization
would save roughly $3.8 billion annually. 19 pp. CONTACT: Competitive

249, The Cato Institute
<P>
Daniel Klein, Assistant Professor of Economics at
the University of California at Irvine, and Pia Maria Koskenoja,
a doctoral student of transportation economics at UC Irvine, argue
that existing technology can make unpopular and burdensome vehicle
emission tests obsolete with no reduction in environmental protection.
Remote-sensing-mobile, roadside, emission sensing devices-would
prove more effective and less costly than current inspection-based
emission programs. Klein and Koskenoja point out that 20 percent
of cars on the road generate 88 percent of automobile air pollution,
and contend that current state inspection and maintenance programs
are inefficient in reducing emissions. Remote-sensing technology,
on the other hand can target the small percentage of polluting
motorists for citation by mail. The study, which is based on several
implementation plans of Los Angeles, notes that the costs of a
remote sensing system would be far less than current programs.
Klein and Koskenoja conclude by calling for amending the Clean
Air Act to allow localities to implement remote-sensing programs.

<B>The State of Violent Crime in America</B>
<P>
The Council on Crime in America 
<P>
Despite a decline in crime rates in certain American
cities, according to this report the likelihood that Americans
will be victims of violent crime remains at an historic high.
The report illustrates a &quot;revolving door&quot; criminal justice
system in which one in three criminals are under the &quot;supervision&quot;
of the justice system when they commit their criminal act. It
is also shown that violent crime accounted for one-fourth of the
43.6 million criminal victimizations in America in 1993, and that
America potentially faces an explosion of juvenile crime that
will be more violent and random than anything Americans have experienced
to date. Within the next ten years the number of males aged 14-17
will increase by 23 percent, and according to the report, these
juveniles will be more crime prone than their predecessors; commit
more crimes with guns; and commit more crimes against strangers.

<B>Crime and Punishment in Texas: Update, <BR>

<P>
<I>Policy Report </I>No. 202, National Center <BR>
for Policy Analysis
<P>
According to this study by Morgan Reynolds, National
Center for Policy Analysis Senior Fellow, the reason behind the
sharp drop in the Texas crime rate is due to the increase in prisons
in which more criminals are serving more time. Reynolds points
out that the increased prison capacity in Texas means that criminals
imprisoned for serious crimes can now expect to be in jail for
a longer period of time. Reynolds finds that the overall rate
of crime in Texas has been cut by 30 percent since 1988, and compared
to 1991, the lower crime rate means that 1,140 fewer Texans will
be murdered in 1996 and 450,000 fewer serious crimes against persons
and property will be reported to police. Reynolds argues that
there is a direct link between expected punishment and the crime
rate. According to Reynolds, Texas can reduce crime even further
by continuing to raise expected punishment. 33 pp.  CONTACT: National

Michael Hartmann, Research Fellow at the Wisconsin
Policy Research Institute, examines the current welfare work-requirement
framework, including Wisconsin's new &quot;W-2&quot; welfare-replacement
program. He uses the ideas of  Edgar Cahn and Marvin Olasky, to
introduce the concept of volunteerism. Both Cahn and Olasky believe
that volunteerism is one of the keys to rebuilding the welfare
system and inner city decay. Hartmann concludes that Cahn's concept
of Time Dollars is something that should be used to help bring
people off of welfare rolls and into the workforce and that solutions
to social problems no longer revolve around traditional liberal
or conservative stances, but around new ideas. 35 pp.  CONTACT:

This paper examines the issue of no-fault divorce

children suffer in a divorce, the parents are no-less affected

that divorced women and men suffer, to a significantly greater
degree than married persons, early death from cancer, cardiovascular
disease, strokes, pneumonia, hypertension, and suicide. The report
concludes that the divorce problem has its roots in both culture
and law, so finding solutions to the current divorce epidemic
needs to encompass both areas. 16 pp.  CONTACT: Michigan Family

<P>
Defenders of Property Rights has argued the case
of <I>Gayle Butcher v. Planning and Zoning Board of Appeals of
Highland Beach</I> before the Maryland Court of Special Appeals.
This appeal raises the issue of whether local government can,
through zoning reclassification, deprive an owner of the use of
a lot to build a single-family home in a fully developed subdivision.
The Butchers and another family bought adjoining lots, one with
a house and the other vacant but developable. The Butchers later
sold the developed parcel and assumed the undeveloped lot with
the intention of building a new home there. The city, however,
said that a zoning ordinance enacted after the lots were originally
purchased precluded them from building on the lot. A decision
is expected to be handed down from the court this Spring.<B>

The case filed by the Institute on behalf of Jon

as owners of &quot;public water wetlands&quot; overcame a big
hurdle on February 5, 1996. Interpreting a Minnesota statute that
appeared to give the public access to privately owned wetlands,
Anoka County District Judge Edward W. Bearse ruled that &quot;it
appears that the plaintiffs would be justified in posting their
land 'no trespassing' and/or 'no hunting,' in seeking the removal
and prosecution of any trespassers, and in actively enforcing
all of their rights as owners of private property.&quot; The judge
granted the defendant Department of Natural Resources' (DNR) motion
for summary judgement to dismiss the case, but on the grounds
that the DNR made concessions during the lawsuit that brought
the agency into agreement with the Bronczyks, thus eliminating
the controversy.<BR>

<B>National Right to Work Defends Against Compulsory Union Dues

<P>
After more than ten years of delay, the National
Labor Relations Board announced a key ruling in . <I>California
Saw and Knife </I>which undermines employees' legal protections
against the use of compulsory union dues for politics. The ruling
completes NLRB deliberation on over 100 charges filed by employees
against the International Association of Machinists (IAM). <BR>

<P>
The employees, some of whom initiated legal action
in October, 1985, objected to the union's use of their compulsory
union dues for politics and other activity unrelated to collective
bargaining. National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation attorneys
challenged IAM's forced unionism policy. Despite clear precedents
such as the Supreme Court's 1988 decision in <I>Communications
Workers v. Beck</I>, which allows employees to cut off the use
of their forced dues for activity unrelated to collective bargaining,
contract administration, and grievance adjustment, the NLRB developed
new legal standards governing employees in forced-unionism situations.
<BR>

<P>
Specifically, the NLRB ruled that IAM union officials'
annual &quot;notice&quot; in their internal propaganda magazine
was sufficient to satisfy an employee's right to have notice before
compulsory dues were extracted from a paycheck. In addition, the
Board held that the union can force workers to pay for activities
outside the workers' collective bargaining unit, in direct contradiction
to Supreme Court rulings in <I>Lehnert v. Ferris Faculty Association</I>
and <I>Ellis v. Brotherhood of Railway, Airline and Steamship

<B>Of Spanish Land Grants and Federal Government Takings</B>

SLF has appeared this month as <I>amicus curiae</I>
before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in a case
that combines unique historical perspective with potential landmark
legal significance. In <I>Beggerly v. United States</I>, the appellate
court will consider the question of the validity of a Spanish
land grant predating the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 and the U.S
Department of Interior's failure to disclose the existence of
the grant during its 20-year attempt to take the land in question
<BR>

<P>
Pursuant to 1971 congressional authorization to acquire
the land as a federal park, and the Department of Interior's subsequent
below-market price offer, the federal government filed suit in
1979, claiming that Mr. Beggerly's title to the land was void
because of the alleged absence of a valid patent. Over the next
ten years, Mr. Beggerly attempted to locate evidence of title
ownership, discovering at the National Archives an 1871 Spanish
land grant conveying the property to a private landowner filed
with the U.S. Land Commissioners in 1816. His appeal, based on
the recently discovered evidence of title, challenges the lower
court ruling that no such evidence existed, and that the federal
government therefore owed Mr. Beggerly nothing for his land. An
appellate decision is expected in early Fall.<BR>

WLF, joined by 21 Members of Congress, filed a brief asking the
Supreme Court to review the appeals court ruling in <I>Yniguez
v. Arizonans for Official English</I> that struck down Arizona's
&quot;official English&quot; law, which requires that the state

contains exceptions allowing a government to act in a language
other than English to protect public health or safety, to protect
the rights of crime victims or criminal defendants, or to comply
with federal law, such as federal requirements that mandate bilingual
education. The appeals court held that the law was not justified
by the goal of encouraging unity and political stability, encouraging
a common language, and protecting public confidence in government
operations. WLF's brief before the Supreme Court argued that the
issue is of national significance and that states have the authority
to determine the language of government business.<BR>

<P>
<B>HUD Opposed in Attempt to Regulate Homeowner's Insurance</B>
<P>
In <I>Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co. v. Cisneros</I>,
WLF filed a brief before the U.S. Supreme Court arguing that the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development lacks the authority
to regulate homeowner's insurance under the fair Housing Act.
WLF noted that HUD's interpretation would undermine long-standing
and legitimate insurance practices, and force consumers to bear
higher costs, by exposing insurance companies to liability for
employing standards that are not intentionally discriminatory
but that have a disparate impact on minorities. For example, many
insurers refuse to insure a property for more than its market
value; a policy that disproportionately limits insurance availability
in low-income areas where the replacement value of a home is often
more than its market value. According to WLF's brief, Congress
never intended for federal regulators to intrude on this traditional
area of state regulation.<BR>

<P>
<B>Anti-Gang Loitering Law Defended</B>
<P>
On behalf of itself, Representatives Henry Hyde and
Philip Crane, and four Chicago neighborhood associations, WLF
urged the Supreme Court of Illinois to review a decision striking
down a Chicago ordinance that prohibits members of a criminal
street gang from loitering on city streets after being directed
to &quot;move on.&quot; The ordinance was adopted in response
to strong community pressure to reduce the presence of gang members
of city streets. WLF's brief rejected the defendants' arguments
that the ordinance is unconstitutional because it is overly vague,
violates the right to freedom of assembly, and criminalizes one's
status as a gang member.<BR>

eliminated? How much real relief can states and localities expect?
How will regulators be affected? On March 6-7, 1996, the Advisory
Commission on Intergovernmental relations will hold a Conference
on federal mandates at the Washington Hilton to address these
questions. Speakers will survey the current state of mandate reform
and recent relief measures, Congressional proposals, key issues
that will shape the course of future debate, and the real effects
of change on states, municipalities, and federal agencies. CONTACT:

<h3>February 1996 <i>Insider</i></h3>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=4>The Environmental
Establishment: A Status Report</FONT></B></CENTER>
<hr><P>
<font size=3>In 1996, Washington's environmental groups have reason
to congratulate themselves: they are large and influential &quot;inside-the-beltway&quot;
political organizations with very large budgets: 1994 revenues
for the Wilderness Society were over $15 million, National Audobon
Society-$36 million, Sierra Club-$43 million, National Wildlife
Federation<I>-</I>$101 million, Nature Conservancy-$307 million.</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3>Despite setbacks in Congress, the environmental movement
remains a powerful force in American politics. The organizations
that lobby and litigate receive respectful hearings in the executive
branch, the courts and in the federal bureaucracy. Environmental
groups retain the power to frustrate industrial and commercial
development and slow economic growth. As author Marek Dowie notes,
&quot;It has become virtually impossible to build a dam, open
a landfill, fire up an incinerator, drill a deep injection well,
or store nuclear waste&quot; without prompting an environmentalist
objection.</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3>But environmental groups have seen their membership
levels stabilize or fall in the 1990s. Losing grassroots support,
they are diversifying their sources of revenue. Individual membership
dues and contributions have been supplemented by corporate and
foundation grants and by commercial sales. Increasingly, green
groups are also relying on government support.</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3>Government funding has created a vicious circle:
Taxpayer dollars fund environmental groups that lobby government
for more programs that will fund more enviromental groups with
taxpayer dollars. Consider some environmental advocacy groups
that received federal grants in 1993, as reported in the Federal
Assistance Awards Data System: The Enviromental Defense Fund received
$236,000 from the EPA to support a national print and television
advertising campaign to promote recycling. The ad series slogan:
&quot;Buy Recycled and Save.&quot; The National Audubon Society
was awarded $75,998 by the EPA to run source reduction public
service announcements on television; The Natural Resource Defense
Council recieved $75,000 from the Department of the Interior to
support its Clean Water television and print advertising campaign,
which was timed to coincide with Congress's reauthorization of
the Clean Water Act; and The Nature Conservancy recieved $44,100
from the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration
for a &quot;cooperative volunteer as outreach program&quot; to
build support for the proposed Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary.
Some of the funds were used to draft congressional testimony and
to pay for campaigns to block a local public referendum on whether
to establish the sanctuary.</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3>Government legal fees and land sales are another
lucrative source of funds: Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund recently
was granted over $1 million in tax money to cover legal costs
for successful lawsuits it filed against the </FONT><font size=3>federal
government over management of public lands; and The Nature Conservancy
received over $476 million in 1993 from land sales to government
agencies. In past cases, lands have been sold at prices above
their appraised value. Such practices recently prompted property
rights activists in New York state to file a lawsuit against The
Nature Conservancy and the Adirondack Land Trust, charging that
both sold land to the state Department of Enviromental Conservation
at more than double its appraised value. </FONT>
<P>
<font size=3>Federal law prohibits use of government funds for
lobbying. But money is fungible: when tax dollars go to nonprofit
enviromental groups; more private dollars can be shifted to lobbying.
Unfortunately, efforts to halt this practice were stalled in the
last session of Congress.</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3>The modern enviromental movement that has grown up
since Earth Day in 1970 has little in common with what it once
was. Groups of hunters and outdoors people once determined what
local conservation societies would do. Now Washington professionals
and full-time activists funded by government agencies and private
philanthropies set the agenda. Groups dedicated to<I> conservation
</I>and the wise use of natural resources have been replaced by
environmental groups dominated by an ideology of <I>preservation</I>.
And conservationists who saw themselves as stewards of both the
natural environment and builders of a modern industrial society
have given way to environmental activists who often disdain technology,
industrial organization, and private sector initiatives.</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3>Still, the price of the movement's success has been
high and the likelihood of failure increases. One critic observed,
&quot;Most of these Washington organizations are paper-issue people.
They don't ask the grass roots, and they don't educate. They are
not accountable.&quot; Radical grassroots activists who are impatient
with Washington deal making are breaking away. Local property
owners are organizing their own groups to defend their rights
and fight harmful policies. Some in the media have grown skeptical
of environmentalist claims. And political candidates are running
and winning campaigns against evironmental extremism.</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3>An energetic advocacy for free market environmental
ideas offers the best answer to the bloated organizations and
failed polices of the current establishment. Americans want environmental
protection, but they also want a growing economy, secure property
rights, and a clear sense that they are in control of their lives.

<i>Land Rights: The 1990's Property Rights Rebellion</i><BR>
Edited by Bruce Yandle, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1995, 333 pp.
<HR>

<P>
&quot;Upon the sacredness of property, civilization itself depends.&quot; -- Andrew
Carnegie
<P>
 In <I>Land Rights:  The 1990s' Property Rights Rebellion</I>,
the authors remind us of the primary role of private property
in a democracy.  This nine essay collection describes how excessive
environmental regulation can infringe private property rights
and effectively violate the Fifth Amendment's guarantee that &quot;nor
shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.&quot;
 In the first chapter, &quot;The Property Rights Movement:  How
It Began and Where It Is Headed,&quot; by Nancie G. Marzulla,
President of Defenders of Property Rights, the author presents
an interesting history of the modern property rights movement.
 Marzulla contends that the modern assault on private property
rights began in 1970 with two events:  the first celebration of
Earth Day and the creation of the Environmental Protection Agency.
 These two events helped spawn a regulatory nightmare for many
innocent property owners.  Marzulla recalls the story of a Florida
man, Ocie Mills, who was imprisoned for 21-months for dumping
sand on his <I>own</I> property.  The sand filled a wetland and
thereby violated the Clean Water Act -- even though a federal judge
later ruled that Mills' land was &quot;probably not&quot; a wetland
under the Act.
<P>
 Marzulla's most interesting point, however, is the following.
The property rights movement is not seeking less environmental
protection -- it merely asks that the few unfortunate landowners
who do lose their property to regulation will no longer be forced
to bear an unfair share of the burden.  Marzulla persuasively
argues that private property is not only not inconsistent with
environmental protection but can actually enhance respect for
the environment by avoiding the tragedy of the commons phenomena
that often accompanies public lands.  
<P>
 In the essay, &quot;The Lucas Case and the Conflict over Property
Rights&quot; James R. Rinehart and Jeffrey J. Pompe explain how
an obscure developer became a poster child for the property rights
movement.  In 1986, David Lucas bought two oceanfront lots near
Charleston, S.C. for approximately $1 million.  At the time, there
were no regulations or laws that would have prevented Lucas from
building a single-family home on the property.  However, in 1988,
South Carolina passed the Beachfront Management Act.  The Act
created a new building setback line that completely prevented
Lucas from developing his property.  In sum, the Act, which did
not contain a grandfather clause, made the two lots worthless.
 Although the state did not officially seize title to Lucas' land,
like so many environmental regulations, it restricted the owner's
ability to use the land to such an extent as to constitute a &quot;taking&quot;
under the Fifth Amendment.  Finally, after four years of tortuous
litigation, $500,000 in legal fees, and an appeal to the U.S.
Supreme Court, Lucas won the case.  The state of South Carolina
was forced to buy the land for market value.  
<P>
 The Lucas case, the authors remind us, represents the key issue
in the environment movement.  When excessive government regulation
inflicts pain on some individuals while benefiting others, who
should bear the costs of the regulation?  The authors argue that
from an equitable perspective, a property owner like Lucas should
not be forced to bear the total cost of a regulation that benefits
everyone, even if the aggregate benefits exceed the property owner's
costs.  Ironically, when the state of South Carolina was forced
to buy Lucas' land, it was faced with a dilemma:  Either develop
the property and protect its expensive investment, or do not develop
property and own two worthless lots.  The state tried to force
the latter option on David Lucas.  Once it owned the property,
however, it hypocritically sold the lots to the highest bidder
for development-an option it denied David Lucas. 
<P>
 The book reminds readers of the importance of a Chief Executive
who is committed to balancing environmental protection with property
rights.  The authors recall how President Reagan appointed officials
who brought a cooperative, common sense attitude toward industry
and property owners.  In the authors view, Reagan officials such
as James Watt as Secretary of the Interior and Anne Gorsuch as
the Environmental Protection Agency Administrator maintained a
proper balance between environmental protection and property rights
that benefited all Americans.  The authors contrast the Reagan
Administration with the heavily regulatory and bureaucratic Bush
and Clinton Administrations.  For example, the book points out
that under Bush appointee William Reilly, the EPA broadened the
definition of &quot;navigable waters.&quot;  This regulatory change
redefined land that held water for only short periods of time
each year as &quot;wetlands&quot; -- doubling the land over which
the federal government exercises control from 100 to 200 million
acres.  This regulatory change vastly expanded the federal government's
control over private property under the Clean Water Act.

 For serious students of public policy, <I>Land Rights: The 1990s'
Property Rights Rebellion </I>is well worth the read.

<font size=3>Heritage Policy Analyst John Hillen writes that NATO's
involvement in the peace operation in Bosnia is a clear signal
that the Atlantic Alliance has strayed far from its original mission
of preventing the domination of Europe by a hostile power. Hillen

alliance of collective security, and calls for a NATO Revitalization
Act to refocus the alliance and preserve American support for
the U.S. role in Europe. 14 pp.  CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The

<font size=3>This issue features a series of articles on the subject
of foreign policy in the '96 presidential race. The first, <I>The
U.S. Electoral Cycle since 1944</I> by David Eisenhower, argues
that U.S. foreign policy will not be a major issue in the 1996
presidential race. In <I>The Populist Revival and Foreign Affairs</I>
by A.J. Bacevich, it is argued that the political realignment
established in the 1994 elections, though not caused by foreign
policy issues, will have substantial implications for future American
diplomacy. Bacevich believes that a populist tide will oppose
a global agenda. In <I>Even Foreign Policy Is a Local Affair</I>,
author Patrick Lloyd Hatcher believes that foreign policy issues,
will indeed, play a large role in the 1996 campaign, as the free
trade/isolationism and downsizing/defense contracts issues will
be of interest to local constituencies. 52 pp.  CONTACT: Foreign

calls for Israel to give up U.S. aid so that it may establish
its economic independence. He argues that Israel's apparent economic
success is only a facade. The real story, according to Rabushka,
is that &quot;Israel is besieged by one economic crisis after
another: power failures, bankrupt kibbutzim, a perpetual housing
crisis, confiscatory taxation, trade restrictions, a massive trade
deficit in both goods and services, budget deficits, high interest
rates, one failed attempt after another at privatization, and
so on.&quot; Despite these chronic problems,  Rabushka notes that
Israel has been able to sustain unparalleled growth for one simple
reason, Israelis live off the money of others-totaling $9 billion
and equaling one-eighth of all goods and services that Israelis
consume. 8 pp. CONTACT: Institute for Advanced Strategic and Political

<font size=3>Allan Meltzer, Visiting Scholar at AEI, comments
on recent financial troubles in Mexico and reviews the chain of
events that have lead to Mexico's unstable economy. Despite positive
economic forecasts in 1994 with the approval of NAFTA, the year
ended with a damaged political structure, major devaluation of
the peso and an overall policy failure. According to Meltzer,
the major players in the tragic events in Mexico were high officials
in the Mexican and U.S. governments and the International Monetary
Fund. Meltzer outlines what Mexico should have done as well as
lessons to be learned from the events of 1994-1995. He concludes
that the role of governments and international agencies in international
finance should be reduced. &quot;Governments that know they must
bear the consequences of their mistaken policies will be more
inclined to moderate those policies.&quot;  6 pp.  CONTACT: American

would cost American consumers billions of dollars. According to
Wayne Leighton, Regulatory Economist at Citizens for a Sound Economy,
this analysis is faulty and based on a misunderstanding of the

<font size=3>The American Legislative Exchange Council proposes
four principles for free market reform in telecommunications 
that should be adapted by each state to fit its own unique statutes,
circumstances and time frames: 1) competition, not regulation,
should shape the telecommunications industry; 2) where regulation
is necessary, it should be competitively neutral and equally applied
to all providers; 3) universal service should be preserved; and
4) all providers should be permitted to compete in all markets.
ALEC belivieves that these four principles are a way to ensure
that consumers get the greatest benefit from telecommunications
innovations by encouraging competition and opening markets. 8

<P>
<font size=3>The Capital Research Center</FONT>


<P>
<font size=3>This study looks at the strategy employed by labor
unions known as a &quot;corporate campaign.&quot; Capital Research
Center Senior Fellow Thomas DiLorenzo illustrates how a &quot;corporate
campaign&quot; organized by a group calling itself Consumers United
with Employees (CUE) was really a public relations ploy against
Food Lion backed by the United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW).
 A tactic used by CUE to smear the reputation of Food Lion was
to use headline grabbing press releases that claimed that a &quot;study&quot;
of Food Lion had &quot;discovered&quot; instances of health violations
within the chain. The reports attempted to mislead the media by
only citing Food Lion errors-some legitimate, some questionable-while

in procedures. DiLorenzo writes that the tactics used by the UFCW
do not help the consumer as they claim, instead, they cause the

<font size=3>Richard Vedder, John M. Olin Visiting Professor of
Labor Economics at CSAB, and Lowell Gallaway, Distinguished Professor
of Economics at Ohio University, illustrate the racial implications
of the Davis-Bacon Act (which requires contractors of federally
funded projects to pay union scale, or &quot;prevailing&quot;
wages). Vedder and Galloway write that the bill was originally
crafted to protect northern white labor against cheaper black
labor from other regions. In addition, they suggest that the legislation
was not race-neutral in its impact, and very likely has caused
a lack of minority participation in the construction industry.
Vedder and Gallaway give a full historical background on the enactment
of the legislation, including the fact that in the two decades
before the passage of Davis-Bacon there was a significant  growth
in the number of black employees outside the South in major construction
crafts. The study concludes that Davis-Bacon, like other minimum
wage laws, has increased unemployment for all groups; but its
negative impact has affected black construction workers disproportionately.

<font size=3>Mackinac Center for Public Policy</FONT>


<P>
<font size=3>In the state of Michigan, the worker's compensation
system was developed as a way for workers who suffer on-the-job
physical injuries to be quickly and fairly compensated for medical
costs and lost income. In recent years, however, an ambiguous
new area of law has developed under workman's compensation that
allows workers to claim injuries due to alleged on-the-job mental
stress. This has lead to complications in Michigan as how to judge
properly whether a claimant is worthy of compensation. This report
illustrates how the worker's compensation system works, its problems
with claims for mental stress injuries, the history of case and
statutory law regarding mental stress, and where the issue stands
today after a crucial 1994 Michigan Supreme Court decision. 36

<P>
<font size=3>Robert Poole, President of the Reason Foundation,
argues that cities could save millions of dollars and improve
response times to 911 emergency calls by privatizing Emergency
Medical Service. In Los Angeles alone, the cost to the taxpayer
for these services is $45.6 million a year. Reason estimates that
contracting with a private provider for certain EMS/paramedic
services would reduce the cost to taxpayers by two-thirds. Poole
concludes that cities and counties should reorganize their EMS
systems by creating a public-private partnership in which the
fire department provides first response service and private ambulance
firms provide all paramedic treatment and transport for all 911
medical calls. The results, according to Poole, would be reduction
of cost to the taxpayer, greater accountability, and quicker response
times. 18 pp. CONTACT: Reason Foundation, 3415 S. Sepulveda Blvd.,

Robert Poole. In his testimony, Poole advocates two forms of privatization
for the federal government, asset divestiture and infrastructure
partnerships. Poole illustrates how such federal enterprises as
the U.S. Postal Service and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting
can be privatized, and lists federal assets, such as commodity
lands, defense reserves, the strategic petroleum reserve, and
government buildings and land that could be utilized better under
private ownership. Poole also discusses the subject of infrastructure
partnership and how the federal government can promote private
ownership and operation of infrastructure. He concludes his testimony
with five general principles for privatization and summarizes
the issues associated with implementing a privatization agenda.

<font size=3>Progressive intellectuals, according to trade attorney
Brink Lindsey, corrupted capitalism by convincing Americans that
bigger is best for labor, business, and government. However, Lindsay
argues that the triumvirate of Big Government, Big Business, and
Big Labor is collapsing. Big Labor has seen this change first,
as unionization of the private sector labor force decline from
36 percent in 1953 to only 11 percent today. Meanwhile, large
American corporations, argued to be immune from market forces
by intellectuals in the 1960s, have been &quot;restructured&quot;
or &quot;reengineered&quot; in the form of middle-management layoffs.
Now, writes Lindsey, it is Big Government's turn. 10 pp. CONTACT:

the following: the congressional plan vetoed by the President
would add $112 billion more to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) over
the next seven years than the same plan would without tax cuts;
furthermore, the cuts in taxes on capital (including the capital

and leads to a stronger economy in the long run. This report also

<font size=3>Citizens for a Sound Economy Analyst Rebbeca Schaefer
argues that a flat tax would not negatively affect the housing
market. While real estate lobbyists claim that the housing market
would be hurt by a  flat tax because it eliminates the mortgage
interest deduction, Schaefer illustrates that families and individuals
do not buy homes because of the tax incentive of a mortgage interest
deduction. Instead, people buy homes for many other reasons: to
relocate, to have more living space, to downsize living space,
to find a better community, etc. Schaefer presents economic evidence
suggesting that a flat tax would bring a drop in mortgage interest
rates by at least 2 percentage points, more than compensating
for the loss of the interest deduction. 8 pp.  CONTACT: Citizens

incentives, among the strongest being marginal tax rates on capital
and the way policy treats consumption and savings. Reynolds writes
that high, progressive taxes suppress capital formation, increase
inequality, and reduce real tax receipts. He calls for an increase
in the incentives to save and invest, with time and money, in
education and training. A low flat tax, according to Reynolds,
would increase the economy's stock of economic and human capital,
which would enlarge national wealth, decrease economic inequality,
and increase tax revenues. 12 pp.  CONTACT: Hudson Institute,

subsidies to bankrupt firms. He warns against the type of growth
that Israel had between 1993 and 1995, which according to Klein,
was due to excess consumption-driven largely by the government's
ever-increasing budgets. The results of this increase in government
spending has been a large trade deficit and foreign debt, high
inflation, and declining productivity, savings and competitiveness.

<font size=3>In this article, New York University Professor Lawrence
Mead examines why Wisconsin's welfare caseload declined 26% since
reforms and new programs were enacted in 1987. According to state
figures, welfare in the average Wisconsin county fell 42%, while
some small counties recorded decreases of as much as 66%. Mead
found that the decline in welfare recipients was due less to Wisconsin's
now thriving economy and more to the priority that reforms placed
on self reliance. Furthermore, Mead writes that Governor Thompson's
conservative, but not necessarily anti-government, policy was
successful in changing the attitudes of most welfare personnel.
Indeed, most welfare officials, according to Mead, appreciated
that the Governor challenged them with the responsibility of getting
recipients to work, rather than just handing out aid. 8 pp.  CONTACT:

<font size=3>Unintended consequences of environmental laws, especially
the federal Superfund law, has led to the proliferation of so-called
brownfield sites in American cities. Brownfield sites are &quot;abandoned
or vacant commercial and industrial properties suspected of containing
at least low levels of environmental contamination.&quot; Such
sites have lost potential developers to fears that a consequence
of owning and cleaning up a site will be state or federal liability
and regulation. Therefore, &quot;lenders will not lend, developers
will not develop, and buyers will not buy.&quot; Citizens for

liability and cleanup standards to be fundamentally reformed.
Until then, concludes Harrold, neither the states and EPA, nor
developers and lenders, will have the assurances or authority

<P>
<font size=3>Dr. Hugh Ellsaesser, retired scientist from the Lawrence
Livermore National Laboratory, reviews examples of the inappropriate
use of science in debates over environmental issues. The essay
begins by showing that misuse of science is a widely recognized
problem, especially in politics and popular culture. Ellsaesser
then delves into three issues where the misuse of science has
been tolerated: the debate over air pollution; the debate over
stratospheric ozone; and the debate over global warming. 31 pp.

<P>
<font size=3>Despite vast improvements in air quality since the
1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, this paper reports that environmentalists
and the American Lung Association are quietly pressuring EPA to
establish a new standard for measuring safe levels of ozone<I>-</I>one
that will be more costly to meet, but may produce little, or no,
meaningful health benefits. Authors Kenneth Chilton, Director
of the Center, and Christopher Boerner, CSAB Fellow, note that
people are already frustrated under the current policy. Programs
such as centralized vehicle inspection and maintenance will increase
the hassle to drivers but may not be an improvement over existing
decentralized programs. Ozone requirements increase costs to individuals
via higher prices and taxes, and impact small businesses more
than large firms. Chilton and Boerner recommend that Congress
revisit the Clean Air Act and allow cost and benefits to be considered
in setting the ozone standard. They conclude: &quot;Unless chronic
effects of prolonged exposures to elevated ozone can be demonstrated
(and after two-and-a-half decades of research, they have not been),
the United States is already spending more taxpayer and consumer
dollars on reducing ozone than the public considers worthwhile.&quot;

<P>
<font size=3>Patrick Fagan, William H.G. FitzGerald Fellow at
Heritage, has found that nearly every major study on the impact
of religion demonstrates its positive impact on a host of social
problems. He gives evidence that religious practice strengthens
the family and brings satisfaction to marriage; helps poor people
move out of poverty; aids substantially in the formation of personal
moral judgement; and inoculates individuals against such social
problems as suicide, drug abuse, out-of-wedlock births, crime
and divorce. According to Fagan, Washington policy-makers should
consider the enormous contribution religion can make toward solving
America's major social problems. Fagan offers several steps that
Congress and the President can take to encourage religious practice,
including: the initiation of a national discussion on the need
to restore the role of religion in American life; passage of a
resolution affirming the census data on the extent of religious
practice; and the appointment of judges who are at least more
sensitive to the role of religion in public life. 29 pp.  CONTACT:

the concerns and opinions of African-Americans in Florida. According
to the report, the ultimate intention of the survey was to take
the first step in the process of building bridges between whites
and blacks. The survey had three major findings: 1) to date, conservatives
have failed to communicate their message to the black community;
2) the political labels of &quot;conservative&quot; and &quot;liberal&quot;
are meaningless in the dialogue, because action is what counts;
and 3) language and perception account for most differences, while
position on most issues are similar. 20 pp. CONTACT: Foundation

He writes that the Supreme Court has been a reluctant and relatively

of the federal government</FONT><I><font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">-</FONT></I><font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">so
state officials should not rely too heavily on the Court as the
ultimate guardian of state interests. Those interested in reviving

reconsider whether institutional changes could be made to strengthen
the authority of the states and establish a more balanced partnership
with the federal government. 23 pp. CONTACT: Council of State

1) the recent American experience with federalism; 2) the forces
at work reviving federalism; and 3) a potential framework for
considering ideas about where the federalsim debate should go
from here. He concludes by writing that restoring federalism requires
at least major legislation, if not a constitutional amendment
to restore power and relationships destroyed by the seventeenth
amendment, which removed state legislatures' authority to elect
U.S. Senators. Burgess warns that whatever approach is taken,
the pursuit of principle-centered remedies and not quick fixes
is key. 10 pp.  CONTACT: Council of State Governments, 444 North

Studies at the Cato Institute, argues that it is time to start
returning power to the states and the people, to relimit federal
power in fundamental law, and to restore constitutional government.
Pilon recommends that Congress take the following actions to achieve
this end: 1) declare that the Constitution remains a document
of limited federal powers; 2) declare that most of what the federal
government does today is done without constitutional authority;
3) identify the precise constitutional authority for doing so
before enacting any new legislation; 4) restore the Commerce Clause
to its original purpose; 5) restore the General Welfare Clause
to its original purpose; 6) restore the Necessary and Proper clause
to its orignal purpose; and 7)  restore those provisions of the
Bill of Rights and the Civil War Amendments that have fallen into
disregard-privileges and immunities, property rights, and economic
liberties. 24 pp.  CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts

The Swedish economists Ingemar St&aring;hl and Kurt Wickman discuss

the politics of high taxation. This particular publication contains

Clinton's Executive Order that bars federal agencies from doing

Through the brief, the two  Senators take the position that the
Executive Order violates the principle of separation of powers
in that the question of striker replacements involves labor policy
which is the prerogative of Congress to establish. In fact, Congress
years ago established such a policy in the National Labor Relations

<font size=3>The Center and co-counsels, representing the Florida
ACLU and the Southeastern Legal Foundation, are representing Gerald
Gee, a professor at Florida A&amp;M University who was suspended
without pay for an in-class remark allegedly constituting discrimination
and harassment. In illustrating a point, the professor used the
term &quot;nigger&quot; although he did not direct the term at
any individual. At issue in this case is whether Gee's remark
to his students is protected under the scope of academic freedom.
After CIR brought a lawsuit in early 1995, asserting claims under
both the Equal Protection and Free Speech clauses of the U.S.
Constitution, and sought a preliminary injunction revoking the
suspension, Florida A&amp;M agreed to rescind the remaining portions

<B>Defenders Seeks to Protect Landowners</B>
<P>
<font size=3>For over a hundred years, the boundaries for some
parcels of land owned in Kamiah, Idaho have been established and
respected. Yet, it turns out that the title descriptions in their
deeds do not reflect these boundaries. At the turn of the century,
a county surveyor believed the original title descriptions to
be erroneous. Based solely on his affidavit-and without conducting
an on-the-ground survey-the U.S. patent office unilaterally amended
the title descriptions in 1901. The property involved in this
dispute, however, has recently become highly desirable for development.
Moreover, it was once part of the Nez Perce Indian Reservation.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">Last December, Bureau of Indian
Affairs (BIA) issued Trespass Notices to eight Idaho residents.
Many more stand to lose the land which they have maintained and
paid taxes on for a half century, for the heirs to the original
members of the Nez Perce Tribe are claiming that the error in
the fee patent means that they own the land-not the people (and
their predecessors on interest) who have owned it since 1953.
BIA agrees and is intervening on behalf of the Indian heirs, asserting
that the present owners are trespassing on Indian land.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">If BIA succeeds in removing
the current occupants, the Indians whose interests the government
claims to represent will not retain title. The land has already
been sold to a developer. If BIA does not remove the current owners,
however, the Indian Law unit of the Legal Services Corporation-which
is representing the Indians free of charge-will sue BIA for failure
to protect the Indian heirs' rights.</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">Defenders is asking Interior
Secretary Babbitt to exercise his discretion to amend the patents
to reflect the original and accurate 1873 descriptions, and the
actual use by all owners for an entire century.<BR>

<B>Defenders Attempts to Stop <BR>
Wetlands Witch Hunt</B>
<P>
<font size=3>Defenders has filed a brief <I>amicus curiae</I>
on behalf of itself and two dozen grassroots property rights organizations
asking the U.S. District Court of Maryland to dismiss criminal
charges against James L.Wilson and his company, Interstate General.
This case bears a remarkable resemblance to the criminal prosecution
of Bill Ellen, a wetlands consultant who spent six months in a
federal penitentiary in 1992 for filling wetlands without a permit.
Now, the same prosecutor is gunning for Mr. Wilson. Defenders
is working with the defendant's private criminal counsel to have
the prosecution thrown out on a variety of grounds. Defenders
argued that the criminal charges brought for the filling of isolated
wetlands in this case are unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment.

Inc. v. City of Burlington, Iowa</I>, arguing that a five-year
amortization period does not constitute &quot;just compensation&quot;
under the Fifth Amendment for the taking of private property.
At issue in this case is a 1988 city ordinance that outlawed the
construction of billboards within city limits. The city did not,
however, actually require Outdoor Graphics to take down its signs
until 1993. That grace (or &quot;amortization&quot;) period, the
city asserts, was the property owner's &quot;just compensation&quot;
for the destruction of the company's business.<BR>

or notice. The suit was filed on behalf of several Park Forest
tenants seeking to vindicate their private property rights under
the Fourth Amendment. The resulting decision from the case could
set a national precedent to bolster protection for the right of
property owners to exclude outsiders from their property. Government
inspectors, wishing to enter a tenant's home, will need to ask
for and receive either the explicit consent of tenants or, if
consent is denied, a search warrant based on some reasonable belief
that the housing code is being violated.<BR>

<b>Cleveland Becomes Second Battleground <BR>
for School Choice</b>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">The Ohio Federation of Teachers
filed a suit to secure an injunction against the nation's second
school choice program, due to commence this Fall, in Cleveland.
The program provides, among other features, vouchers of approximately
$2,250 for about 1,500 low-income children in grades K-3 to attend
private schools. The program has attracted more than 50 schools
and 6,550 applicants-1,500 of whom were selected through a lottery
system. The lawsuit, styled <I>Gatton v. Goff</I>, challenges
the program on state and federal constitutional grounds. The primary
focus is establishment of religion. The Institute worked closely
with Governor Voinovich as the plan was developed, and having
worked in the Cleveland low-income community since last summer,
is preparing to intervene on behalf of Hope for Cleveland's Children,
the Hough Academy of Higher Learning, and individual families.

<B>Federal Circuit to Rehear <I>Preseault</I> Case</B>
<P>
<font size=3>In an unusual action, the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit has vacated and will now rehear the <I>Preseault</I>
case. This overturns a recent decision by two judges of that court
who had held that Paul and Patricia Preseault had no remedy for
the United States' action in converting an abandoned railroad
right of way across their land into a heavily traveled public
recreational trail. The now-vacated decision had severely undercut
landowners' rights to seek compensation from the federal government
for &quot;taking&quot; their property. The court held that a party
was required to sue the government immediately after passage of
any law that &quot;foreshadowed&quot; a future taking. In the
Preseaults'<I> </I>case, that meant that they would have had to
sue in 1920, 60 years before the trail was even built. The new
decision breaths life back into over a dozen takings cases which
are following in the Preseaults' tracks. It is a major setback
for the government's effort to obtain rights over private land
without having to pay for those rights.</FONT>

<B>NELF to File <I>Amicus </I>Brief in <BR>
<B>Unemployment Case</B></B>
<P>
<font size=3>NELF will file a friend of the court brief for the
Connecticut Business and Industry Association in support of Yankee
Gas System's appeal of a decision ordering it to pay unemployment
benefits to striking workers.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">The case involves a 1992 labor
dispute. Yankee offered workers a small raise and reserved the
right to change its medical insurance program in the future in
a manner the workers opposed. Negotiations broke down and workers
went on strike. During the strike the company kept operating,
using managers and some replacement workers. Three months later
the strike ended and the workers returned.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">A state agency has now characterized
the strike as a &quot;lockout&quot; and ordered Yankee to pay
unemployment benefits for the duration of the strike. The agency
found that the company's final offer was inferior to the prior
contract under which the workers were willing to keep working.
Both points are dubious. The new contract offered a modest raise
as well as the health insurance change, Furthermore, the agreement
to keep working was illusory since Yankee's workers reserved the
right to strike at any time they found more tactically convenient.
NELF's brief will focus on the decision's impact in shifting the
balance in labor disputes toward labor.<BR>

<B>NELF Represents Maine Oil Dealer</B>
<P>
<font size=3>NELF will represent Conrad Thibeault, a Maine fuel
dealer who voluntarily cleaned up some spilled oil on his property
and now is being made to pay for his good deed. When he discovered
the spill, Mr. Thibeault notified the state Departmnet of Enviromental
Protection, negotiated a cleanup plan and then actually cleaned
up the site. Only then did DEP tell Mr. Thibeault that it would
not reimburse him for 70% of the cleanup costs which it now felt
had gone to improving the property as well as cleaning it up.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">Maine has an Oil Clean-up
Fund which is derived from fees paid by oil dealers like Mr. Thibeault.
The Fund was created to reimburse people for &quot;any expenses
involved&quot; in oil spill cleanups. The law contains not a word
about denying reimbursement if a cleanup also has the incidental
benefit of improving the property.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">NELF will appeal Mr. Thibeault's
case to the Fund Insurance Review Board and argue that when the
state approves the details of particular cleanup plans, it cannot
later renege and refuse to reimburse a person who in good faith
implemented the plan and cleaned up a spill. The state's policy
is shortsighted. It is not only unfair, but counterproductive.
If it becomes common practice, it will eliminate any incentive
for voluntary spill cleanups.<BR>

<B>NELF to Support Punitive Damages Appeal</B>
<P>
<font size=3>For decades it has been a common practice in the
telephone industry for field workers to carry their lunches to
the job site. Workers were given 30 minutes to eat lunch on the
site, but were not paid for that time.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">The U.S. Labor Department
sued Southern New England Telecommunications, a Connecticut phone
company, claiming that its failure to pay workers for lunch breaks
violated the Fair Labor Standards Act. A federal judge agreed
and ordered the company to end the practice and to pay workers
over $4 million in back pay and overtime. The judge also held
that the violation was &quot;willful&quot; and therefore he doubled
the amount of damages to $9 million as a penalty<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">NELF will file an <I>amicus</I>
brief opposing the punitive double damages. The policy of not
providing paid lunches may not have been consistent with federal
law, but in light of the universal, decades-long practice in the
industry it cannot reasonably have been a &quot;willful&quot;
violation of the law. The U.S. Court of Appeals in New York will
hear the case.<BR>

<B>Washington Supreme Court Gives Lip Service to Landowner's Rights</B>
<P>
<font size=3>Despite the U.S. Supreme Court's unequivocal ruling
last June in <I>Dolan v. City of Tigard</I>, a Washington property
owner was unable to receive the benefits of that landmark decision
when the Washington Supreme Court applied <I>Dolan</I> in such
a manner as to render the precedent-setting decision meaningless.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">Douglas County, Washington,
approved a 16-lot residential subdivision on the condition that
the owner dedicate various strips of land for future road widening.
Relying on the <I>Dolan </I>decision, the Court of Appeals found
the exaction to be an unconstitutional taking, since there was
no showing that the new homes would create any need to widen the
roads. The Washington Supreme Court thought otherwise.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">Under <I>Dolan</I>, when government
requires the dedication of land in exchange for a permit, it must
<I>prove</I> that the particular land dedication at issue is &quot;roughly
proportional&quot; to any harm caused by the project being permitted.
Government has the burden of proof and must make an &quot;individualized
determination that the required dedication is related both in
nature and extent to the impact of the proposed development.&quot;
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">This case presented the first
opportunity for the Washington Supreme Court to consider this
&quot;rough proportionality&quot; test established in <I>Dolan</I>
and the type of information that is sufficient to justify an exaction
of land in return for a building permit. Unfortunately, the Washington
Supreme Court did not require any calculations of proportionality.
It simply upheld the land exactions based on the general increase
in traffic attributable to the development.<BR>

on him as a condition for receiving a permit to construct a housing
development.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">A ruling in favor of Mr. Ehrlich
could substantially limit local government's exactions of so-called
&quot;mitigation&quot; or &quot;linkage&quot; fees from private

landmark decision in <I>Dolan v. City of Tigard</I>.<BR>

<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">For several years, Mr. Ehrlich
operated a private tennis club but was unable to make a financial
success of it. In 1988, he closed the facility and donated most
of the movable equipment to the city and proposed a townhouse
condominium project on the property. The City Council approved
the project on condition that Mr. Ehrlich pay $280,000, which
the city estimated was the cost of building replacement tennis
courts.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">PLF contends that the fee
is unconstitutional because it fails the rough proportionality
test laid down in the <I>Dolan</I> case.  The <I>Ehrlich</I> case
differs in that the property owner is being asked to come up with
cash instead of land.<BR>

<B>National Attention Focuses on Parental Rights Lawsuit</B>
<P>
<font size=3>SLF is proceeding with its parental rights lawsuit
in <I>Earles v. Stephens County School District, et. al., </I>which
is currently before the U.S. District Court. Filed on behalf of
the parents of two teenage sisters, the lawsuit challenges the
constitutionality of the school administration's actions in transporting
the minor girls during school hours to a local public health clinic,
where the girls received HIV/AIDS tests, PAP smear tests, condoms,
and prescription birth control pills-all without parental consent
or notification. The parents have been denied access to the results
of the tests.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">National media attention has
focused on this case as a lightning rod for the parental rights
debate in this country. SLF attorneys testified before a joint
U.S. House and Senate committee, which is considering proposed
parental rights legislation, on the constitutional status of the
parental right to direct and control the education and upbringing
of children. SLF attorneys pointed out that the U.S. Supreme Court
has established that parental rights are fundamental and, as such,
are entitled to the strongest legal protections against government
interference.<BR>

<B>Business Owner Liability Gets Helping Hand</B>
<P>
<font size=3>In a victory for Georgia businesses and property
owners, the Georgia Supreme Court overturned a state Court of
Appeals decision, which held that property owners were charged
with constructive knowledge of criminal acts previously committed
on their property as part of their duty of ordinary care. The
Court of Appeals decision had made businesses liable for every
criminal act committed on their property, whether reasonably foreseeable
or not.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">In <I>Sun Trust Banks v. Killebrew</I>,
SLF argued as <I>amicus curiae</I> that any relaxation of the
doctrine of ordinary care would exacerbate the plight of those
property owners and businesses who are least able to protect their
own property, let alone their patrons. The Georgia Supreme Court
agreed, pointing out that imposing a greater burden on business
owners by the government is an abdication of its &quot;paramount&quot;
constitutional duty to &quot;protect person and property.&quot;

<B>Challenge to State's Intangibles Tax</B>

<font size=3>SLF is representing a Georgia corporation in a lawsuit

residents. The state currently collects about $40 million annually
from the tax, which is distributed to counties.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<font size=3 FACE="Times New Roman">At issue is the extent to
which the state can exempt the taxation of stocks and bonds of
Georgia corporations while it continues to tax the stocks and
bonds of out-of-state corporations. The U.S. Supreme Court is
currently considering a challenge to a similar tax in North Carolina,
which legal analysts believe will succeed. SLF attorneys point
out that Georgia's tax is a more egregious violation of the Commerce
Clause of the U.S. Constitution than the North Carolina tax.

program in <I>C.K. v. Shalala</I>, a suit brought by welfare recipients
who are represented by Legal Services of New Jersey, the ACLU
of New Jersey, and the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund. Under
New Jersey's Aid to Families with Dependent Children system, a
single mother previously received an increase in her monthly cash
payment for each additional child born. New Jersey's reform program
eliminates the grant increase to mothers who have additional children
after joining the rolls. Seven AFDC recipients and their children
filed suit, alleging that the program violates the due process
and equal protection requirements of the United States and New
Jersey constitutions and that it violates federal statutes and
regulations governing AFDC, family planning services, and research
on human subjects. The case is before the Third Circuit following

<h3>December/January 1996 <i>Insider</i></h3>: 

<h4><i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</i></h4>
</center>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/meyerson.htm">Adam Meyerson</a>, Vice President for Educational Affairs at The Heritage Foundation.<hr>
<p>
<I>Policy Review</I>, the magazine of The Heritage Foundation,
has a contemporary new look, a partial name change, and a historic
new mission: to restore the tradition of American citizenship
by repairing the institutions of civil society and returning to
the core political principles of our Founding Fathers.
<P>
Our new name is <a href="/heritage/p_review/jan96/toc75.html"><I>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</I></a>.
We'll be publishing six rather than four times a year. We will
focus on the institutions of civil society-families, communities,
voluntary associations, churches and other religious organizations,
business enterprises, public and private schools, local governments-that
are solving problems more effectively than large, centralized,
bureaucratic government.
<P>
We think of our mission as &quot;Applied Tocqueville,&quot; in
honor of Alexis de Tocqueville, the French aristocrat who in 1832
wrote <I>Democracy in America</I>, still the best book about our
country ever published. Tocqueville described an America that
was the most democratic, most egalitarian, most religious, most
prosperous, most charitable country on earth-with limited national
government and active citizen involvement in local government.
It was an America of strong families and entrepreneurial business
leadership, an America where voluntary associations of citizens
were better than politicians in addressing the problems of their
communities. <I>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</I>
will study the success stories of institutions and civic leaders
today who are carrying on this tradition.
<P>
We believe that the restoration of civil society is one of the
most important challenges and opportunities facing conservatism
over the next generation. Sixty years of liberalism have left
America's social fabric in tatters. The family, the building block
of a compassionate society, is collapsing. Crime is robbing America's
poor of hope and killing opportunity in vast sections of our cities.
Public education is preparing children neither for citizenship
in a free society nor for competition in a 21st-century economy.
<P>
Big Government is not the solution to these catastrophes. But
merely dismantling Big Government is not the answer, either. Conservatives
must rebuild families, voluntary associations, local governments,
and other institutions of civil society that will remedy the ills
left untreated by failed liberal programs. 
<P>
The return of political powers and responsibilities from Washington
to smaller units of government will not automatically bring this
about. Liberal ideas, interest groups, and bureaucratic structures
are even more entrenched in statehouses and city halls than in
the federal government. Nonprofit charities have been corrupted
by a heavy dependence on government money. Many leading charities
share the entitlement mentality of the welfare state and, as the
United Way and New Era scandals suggest, are often less accountable
than government.
<P>
Entirely new institutions will have to be created. Conservative
public policies can erase the welfare state's incentives for family
collapse, but they cannot put the family back together. Government
cannot build and sustain healthy marriages, nor teach children
to be hardworking, responsible, and virtuous. The family will
be restored not by public policy but by private, character-building
institutions that touch the souls of men and women and inspire
them to be more responsible husbands, wives, and parents. 
<P>
Lock-them-up policies in criminal justice are likewise necessary
but insufficient to address the catastrophe of crime. The root
cause of crime is spiritual, a hardening of the heart that makes
a man or woman indifferent to the rights of others. The most effective
institutions in criminal justice will therefore be those that
create moral communities and transform individual attitudes and
behaviors.

The second half of the 19th century and the early 20th century

<i>Goldwater: The Man Who Made a Revolution</i><br>
By Lee Edwards, Regnery Publishing 1995, 572 pp.<hr>

	Lee Edwards Goldwater: The Man Who Made a Revolution is an insightful and important look at the man who is more responsible than any other for the growth and success of the conservative movement in America. This biography is all the more timely, given the conservative congressional sweep of November 1994. It portrays a Goldwater who is every bit as fiesty as legend tells, and quite a bit more complex.<P>
	Edwards, who was a veteran of the 1964 Goldwater campaign, provides a thorough examination of Goldwaters life, starting with his childhood and his days at Staunton Military Academy. Special attention, of course, is paid to Goldwaters career in the U.S. Senate, his Presidential campaign of 1964 (and the Draft Goldwater effort that drew him into it), his role in the making and unmaking of presidents from 1968 through 1976, and his more recent  pronouncements on social issues. <P>
	While Goldwater delivers a wealth of information, three particularly important and interesting points stand out. First, the reader is reminded that some things are so old that they seem new. The negative campaigning that journalists often decry today was pioneered by Lyndon Johnsons reelection campaignwith the tacit approval of the major media. Indeed, in three decades of presidential elections since 1964, no campaign of any party has matched Johnsons for sheer dishonesty, demagoguery, and meanness.  Edwards methodically reminds the reader of the infamous Daisy Girl advertisement, as well as the less-well-remembered but still devastating Ice Cream Girl and Social Security ads. Johnsons whole Anti-Campaign, complete with political espionage and possible misuse of the FBI, not only set a sad precedent for CREEP but almost certainly exceeded it in scope and (needless to say) efficiency.<P> 
	Edwards also reminds us that the savage and unwarranted attacks on Goldwater in the fall of 1964 were made more plausible by the drubbing he received at the hands of fellow Republicans during the nomination contest. While Edwards concedes that no Republican could have defeated Johnson in 1964 (a fact Edwards maintains was well understood by Goldwater himself throughout the campaign), he makes a powerful argument that the attacks of liberal Republicans like Rockefeller, Romney, and Scranton, helped turn a mere defeat into a landslide.<P>
	Second, Edwards thoughtfully illuminates the complexity of Barry Goldwater. Edwards argues that, far from being a recent phenomenon, Goldwater has always been torn between a traditionalist side and a libertarian side, the side that today surprises conservatives with exclamations of pro-choice and pro-gay sentiment. This split could be seen even in Goldwaters earliest political involvement: one of his first political acts was to urge the city of Phoenix to reject the evils of dog racing, yet one of his first votes after being elected to the Phoenix city council was to approve a liquor license for a supermarket 1200 feet from West Phoenix High School over the objections of local parents and religious leaders.    <P>
	Edwards argues that this complexity has been often intertwined with another factor: to Barry Goldwater, a personal connection often meant more than philosophical consistency. His lack of a deeply personal connection to Ronald Reagan, for example, may largely explain Goldwaters often-cool relationship with his heir as leader of the conservative movement. His recent stand on social issues may have been influenced not only by his latent libertarianism but by his daughters abortions and the homosexuality of a grandson and grandniece. Barry Goldwater is an intensely human figure, and the human relationships of day to day life have almost certainly affected his politics to a greater degree than most conservatives have understood.  <P>
	Finally, and most importantly, Edwards succeeds in reminding his readers of the unpayable debt that conservatives owe to Barry Goldwater, regardless of the meanderings of his latter years. Edwards catalogues a fraction of the multitude of individuals who began their political lives inspired by Barry Goldwater and who went on to carry forward the conservative cause. He imagines, plausibly, all the good that would not have happened without a Senator Barry Goldwater and a campaign of 1964, and imagines equally plausibly all the good that might have happened had he won. <P>  
	As Edwards shows, sometimes Goldwater himself was unaware of the potential impact of his actions: he did not anticipate how his 1957 Senate speech criticizing the Eisenhower budget would catapult him to leadership of the conservative movement, nor did he anticipate that Conscience of a Conservative would have any appreciable effect on the nations politics. At other times, especially in 1964, Goldwater understood well that he carried on his shoulders the aspirations of millions of freedom-loving Americans. Always, however, he made a difference. As Edwards concludes, Goldwaters 1964 presidential campaign marked the true beginning of a tectonic shift in American politics from East to West, from the cities to the suburbs, from big government to limited government, from containment to liberation, from liberal to conservative that continues to shape the nation, as the historic elections of 1994 attest.<P>

<P>
<B>Selected Foreign and Defense Policy Issues for the '96 Presidential
Campaign</B>, by Thomas Henriksen
<br>
<I>Briefing</I>, Pacific Research Institute

<P>
President Clinton has not only failed to craft a coherent international
mission for the United States, but he has also failed to resolve
a host of independent conflicts, according to Thomas Henriksen,
Senior Fellow &amp; Associate Director at the Hoover Institution.
This study surveys several foreign policy issues facing America
as it enters the 1996 national election campaign, including: the
proliferation of mass-destruction weapons; counter-terrorism;
the role of the United States in the new international order;
human rights; continuing trouble spots (e.g. North Korea &amp;
Bosnia); and defense cutbacks and pentagon reorganization. 22

<B>The Rising Threat of Revolutionary Islam <BR>
in Algeria</B>, by James Phillips 
<br>
<I>Backgrounder</I> No. 1060, The Heritage Foundation

<P>
If the bloody civil war in Algeria is not halted, argues Heritage
Senior Policy Analyst James Phillips, the resulting political
chaos could destabilize the entire region. According to Phillips,
the only thing worse than the present situation would be victory
by Islamic radicals over the Algerian army. Such an outcome would
pose significant long-term threats to U.S. interests in North
Africa, the Middle East, and the Muslim world generally. Phillips
provides a history of Algeria's political breakdown and a view
of the current stalemate and grim future. He then points out how
a revolutionary Algeria would undermine U.S. interests and describes
a policy that he believes the Clinton administration should adopt.

In a speech given at The Heritage Foundation, President &Aacute;rp&aacute;d
G&ouml;ncz asserted that Hungary must set off on the road to Euro-Atlantic
integration, including full-fledged membership in NATO and the
European Union. President G&ouml;ncz surveyed the history of his
country since the end of the Cold War, and concluded that Hungary's
speedy integration into a Euro-Atlantic alliance should continue
despite criticism that the change is occurring too fast.  The
President also stated that it is his country's responsibility
to avoid delays and &quot;to drop anchor as soon as possible,
and for good, in the safety of the developed democracies' haven.&quot;

<B>Holbrooke Horror: The U.S. Plan for Bosnia,  <BR>
</B>by Ted Galen Carpenter 
<br>
<I>Foreign Policy Briefing</I> No. 37, Cato Institute

<P>
Cato Institute's Director of Foreign Policy Studies, Ted Galen
Carpenter, contends that the Clinton administration foolishly
insists on maintaining the fiction of a united Bosnian state while
accepting a de facto ethnic partition.  Carpenter declares that
the inherent contradiction between those two objectives will doom
the peace agreement and pose a grave danger to the proposed U.S.-led
NATO peacekeeping force.  The author then lists specific problems
with <BR>
the peace plan and describes the multiple sources of danger  a
U.S.-led peacekeeping force will face. The paper concludes with
a recommended alternate plan of action advocating that the belligerents
themselves reach a durable agreement reflecting battlefield realities
and the balance of political and military forces.  Carpenter writes
that under no circumstances should the United States send troops
to enforce an inherently unworkable peace accord. 15 pp. CONTACT:

<B>How to Close Down the Department of Energy,</B> <BR>
by John Barry
<br>
<I>Backgrounder </I>No. 1061, The Heritage Foundation

<P>
Heritage Foundation Research Assistant John Barry calls for shutting
down the Department of Energy (DOE) and outlines the Heritage
proposal to do so. Among the provisions of the plans are: selling
off DOE assets such as the Strategic and Naval Petroleum Reserves;
terminating unnecessary DOE programs, privatizing government owned
laboratories, and transferring all defense-related nuclear weapons
functions to a new agency within the Department of Defense. According
to Barry, closing down DOE and making the related reforms would
save American taxpayers more than $41 billion over the next five
years, including $16 billion in asset sales. 21 pp.  CONTACT:

<B>The Telecom Revolution: American Opportunity</B> 
<br>
The Progress and Freedom Foundation 

<P>
The United States should replace and modernize its existing telecommunications
regulatory policies, argue the authors of this comprehensive study.
The study notes that the telecommunications industry already constitutes
one-seventh of our economy and, by the early 21st century, the
global information industry is expected to be a $3 trillion market.
Furthermore, in 1995, one-half of all capital investment in America,
broadly defined, will be in computers and telecommunications equipment.
Despite these facts, the telecommunications industry must comply
with a  statutory and regulatory system erected in the 1930's.
The study outlines recommendations that, according to the authors,
would provide for a modern and effective government to complement
market forces, speeding the development of new products and services
for Americans. 111 pp.  CONTACT: The Progress &amp; Freedom Foundation,

<B>The Human Cost of Regulation: the Case of Medical Devices and
the FDA, </B>by David Murray
<br>
<I>Hudson Briefing Paper </I>No. 183, The Hudson Institute

<P>
The Food and Drug Administration's current system for approving
medical devices has been marred by regulatory snags that unnecessarily
delay the introduction of lifesaving and life-enhancing products
to the market, according to Hudson Research Analyst David Murray.
Meanwhile, the European Community's medical device approval system
allows new products that are no less safe than in the United States
to reach the market far more quickly. The author suggests that
the U. S. should adopt a system similar to that used by the European
Community for medical device approvals. Such a system would terminate
FDA's monopoly on the premarket approval of medical devices and
establish a mainly privatized process, based on a quality systems
approach to evaluation. 24 pp.  CONTACT: Hudson Institute, Herman

<B>Regulatory Reform in the Electric <BR>
Power Industry,</B> by Vernon Smith
<br>
<I>Issues Analysis </I>No. 3, The Barry Goldwater Institute.

<P>
According to University of Arizona Professor Vernon L. Smith,
the public is finally challenging the notion that certain industries,
most specifically the electric power industry, are &quot;natural
monopolies.&quot; Smith looks at how various countries are seeking
to deregulate their electric power industries, and shows that
countries that only a few years ago were using a central planning
approach are now surpassing the United States in establishing
competitive electric power industries. The report concludes that
policy makers should begin thinking seriously about reforming
our approach to the electric power industry. 20 pp.  CONTACT:

<B>Dangerous Excesses: A Look at the Food <BR>
and Drug Administration, </B>by Jeffrey J. Pierce
<br>
<I>Issues Analysis </I>No. 13, Citizens for a Sound <BR>
Economy Foundation

<P>
Jeffrey Pierce, Regulatory Analyst at Citizens for a Sound Economy
Foundation, shows that the Food and Drug Administration-originally
designed to protect the health of U.S. consumers-has increasingly
become an obstacle to providing consumers with potentially life-saving
drugs and medical devices. Pierce notes that delays in approvals
by the agency are ballooning, as the new drug approval process
now takes some 13-15 years. At the same time, the agency has been
growing, with a budget nearing the billion dollar mark. Peirce
illustrates how FDA has dramatically enlarged its authority, and
cites several instances where it has dramatically delayed the
development of new medical devices and medicines. The paper also
shows that FDA has been expanding its limits on the speech of
pharmaceutical companies and food manufacturers. Pierce, concludes
with a comprehensive set of recommendations for improving FDA,
including: prioritizing functions, allowing private organizations
and laboratories to issue medical device approvals; and contracting
out testing to the private sector. 14 pp.  CONTACT: Citizens for

<B>The FDA vs. Recycling: Has Food Packaging Law Gone Too Far?</B>
<B>Part 1,</B> by Alexander Volokh
<br>
<I>Policy Study</I> No. 196, Reason Foundation

<P>
According Alexander Volokh, Assistant Policy Analyst at the Reason
Foundation, food packaging regulations enforced by the Food and
Drug Administration aimed at preventing contaminants from entering
our food may discourage the use of recycled materials. Volokh
writes that FDA operates under the assumption that all substances
diffuse over time, that everything that makes up your Coca-Cola
bottle will <I>eventually</I> become part of your Coke, and vice
versa. Therefore, FDA regulates the components of food packaging
as <I>indirect</I> food additives. Because FDA scrutinizes recycled
materials so closely, it usually takes a half a year or more and
costs hundreds of thousands of dollars to gain FDA approval for
recycled packaging material. Volokh suggests that deregulation
of the approval process would be a way to expand recycling markets.

<B>The FDA vs. Recycling: How RCRA has Recyclers Running Around
in CERCLAs, Part 2</B>, by Alexander Volokh
<br>
<I>Policy Study</I> No. 197, Reason Foundation

<P>
Part 2 of &quot;The FDA vs. Recycling&quot; shows that federal
hazardous waste regulations, such as the Resource Conservation
Recovery Act (RCRA) and Superfund, have burdened the hazardous
waste recycling industry, damaging the economic viability of recycled
products like lead batteries and used oil. For example, a company
that wants to get a permit to send their industrial waste, such
as car batteries or scrap metal, to be recycled faces a huge liability.
Under Superfund-which regulates the cleanup of toxic waste sites-if
a recycling facility is declared hazardous, whoever arranged for
the treatment or disposal of a hazardous substance can be liable
for the cleanup of the entire site. The paper concludes that if
products are heavily regulated after they are thrown out or in
the process of recycling, it should not be a surprise that people
will prefer to use virgin materials rather than recycle. 24 pp.

<B>What a Balanced Federal Budget with Tax Cuts Would Mean to
the Economy,</B> by William Beach and John Barry
<br>
<I>F.Y.I. </I>No. 69, The Heritage Foundation

<P>
Congress's balanced budget plan with tax cuts will lead, over
the next seven years, to greater business investment, higher earnings
per hour, and faster economic growth than under current law, according
to William Beach, Heritage Visiting Fellow in Tax Analysis, and
John Barry, Heritage Research Assistant. Beach and Barry conducted
an interim analysis of Congress's balanced budget plan with tax
cuts using the econometric model developed by Laurence H. Meyer
&amp; Associates, the same model used by the Clinton administration's
OMB and the Federal Reserve Board. Rather than cause an economic
downturn as some critics of the plan believe, the Heritage analysis
predicts that the following economic boons to American families
and businesses would result over the next seven years: an additional
$32.1 billion in real disposable income; an additional $66.2 billion
in consumption expenditures; an additional $88.2 billion in real
non-residential fixed investment; and an additional 103,700 housing
starts. 8 pp. CONTACT: Chris O'Scannlain, The Heritage Foundation,

<B>Direct Student Loans: Putting Taxpayers at Risk,</B> by Michael
Cannon
<br>
<I>Issues and Answers</I> No. 14, Citizens for a <BR>
Sound Economy
<P>
Through the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFELP), the
federal government insures against defaulted loans made to students
by private lending institutions. According to Michael Cannon,
Citizens for a Sound Economy Policy Analyst, this program has
proven costly, forcing taxpayers to foot the bill for billions
of dollars in defaulted loans. The administration's response to
the problem has been to offer all loans directly to students-bypassing
traditional lending institutions. Cannon contends that government
control of student loans will not only cause default rates to
skyrocket but will also place all the risk on the shoulders of
taxpayers. The author suggests that the federal government limit
taxation and government spending so that students will have more
money to put toward college tuition and more private sector jobs
waiting for them upon graduation. Cannon concludes that Congress
must reject any plan to nationalize the student loan industry
if they are serious about protecting taxpayers from wasteful government
spending. 5 pp.  CONTACT: Citizens for a Sound Economy, 1250 H

<B>Public vs. Private: Stadium Financing, <BR>
Operation and Development,</B> by Grant Gulibon
<br>
Allegheny Institute

<P>
According to Grant Gulibon, Allegheny Institute Research Assistant,
the power that professional sports teams are able to wield over
their local governments comes from overrated economic and psychological
value to the given municipalities. Gulibon demonstrates that professional
sports' economic contribution to local communities is exaggerated
and that only privately financed and owned stadiums remain a profitable
investment. His study also shows that government owned and operated
stadiums are rarely run efficiently and remain a taxpayer burden.
This theory is applied to Pittsburgh's current stadium situation
and threats by team owners to leave town if a new stadium is not
built. Gulibon concludes that if a new stadium is built it should
be a private venture and not be financed by public money or owned
by the local government. 20 pp.  CONTACT: Allegheny Institute

<B>Politics and the Power of the Purse,</B> by Dwight Lee
<br>
<I>Contemporary Issues Series</I> No. 75, Center for the Study
of American Business

<P>
In this essay, University of Georgia Economics Professor Dwight
Lee asks what the prospects of halting and then reversing federal
spending are. Lee points out that the problem of an excessive
and increasingly out-of-touch federal government is explained
by two interconnected problems. First, since the 1930's, political
power has become increasingly centralized in Washington, with
the federal government taking over more and more functions that
were not traditionally government responsibilities at any level.
Second, the federal tax system takes a large percentage of the
taxes paid by Americans. Lee writes that the type of reform necessary
to control the tax and spend power of the federal government cannot
be realized by congressional legislative fiat. This is serious
reform, according to the author, the type that has to be imposed
on reluctant politicians.  Lee calls for tax reform that is backed
by a constitutional amendment. 16 pp.  CONTACT: Center for the

<B>The Allegheny Regional Asset District Tax,</B> <BR>
by Jake Haulk
<br>
Allegheny Institute

<P>
This report analyzes the Allegheny Regional Asset District (RAD)
and the local option sales tax which funds it. RAD is a program
similiar to programs in large American cities that uses dedicated
tax revenue to subsidize cultural and recreational organizations,
usually stadiums for professional sports franchises. The report
details specific damage that the RAD tax has caused. Included
is evidence that the added sales tax will cause a shift of some
sales and jobs out of one county and into neighboring counties.
Furthermore, according to Allegheny Institute's Jake Haulk, a
supposed tax reform component of the RAD program is largely a
redistribution from better off suburbs to poorer municipalities.
By lumping this redistribution effort with the RAD program, the
opportunity for real tax reform as well as tax and expenditure
reductions by local governments has been largely foreclosed. 18

<B>Why Congress Must Reform Welfare, <BR>
</B>by Robert Rector
<br>
<I>Backgrounder </I>No. 1063, The Heritage Foundation

<P>
Robert Rector, Senior Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation,
discusses why Congress must reform welfare. Rector begins by addressing
the claim often times presented to the public that the current
welfare system does not promote long-term dependence. Rector's
research shows that: 1) the 4.7 million families currently receiving
AFDC have already spent, on average, six-and-a-half years on welfare;
2) when past and estimated future receipt of AFDC are combined,
the estimated average length of stay on AFDC, among those families
currently receiving benefits, is 13 years; and 3) among the 4.7
million families currently receiving AFDC, over 90 percent will
spend more than two years on the AFDC caseload. Next, Rector shares
the results of recent research by Congressional Budget Office
Director June O'Neill, which shows that increasing the length
of time a child spends on welfare may reduce the child's IQ by
as much as 20 percent. Rector writes that the more welfare income
received by a boy's family during his childhood, the lower the
boy's earnings as an adult, even when compared to boys in families
with identical non-welfare income. Furthermore, Rector demonstrates
how receipt of welfare and living in a single-parent family during
childhood are strongly associated with criminal activity among
young men and having illegitimate children among young women.
Rector concludes by outlining the basic themes of the House/Senate
conference proposals to reform welfare. 12 pp. CONTACT: Chris

<B>Reforming Medicare: Comparing the House <BR>
and Senate Legislation, </B>by John Liu
<br>
<I>Issue Bulletin </I>No. 220, The Heritage Foundation

<P>
Heritage Policy Analyst John Liu illustrates why Medicare needs
serious reform if taxpayers are to be spared future tax increases
or deep cuts in Medicare benefits for the elderly. Liu believes
the current reforms being proposed in Congress are only stop-gap
measures to ward off fiscal disaster when the &quot;Baby-Boom&quot;
generation qualifies for Medicare. This paper compares the components
of the House and Senate Medicare reform proposals and identifies
the best policy in each area. For example, while both bills establish
consumer choice in health plans, Lui believes that they should
also expand the options available to senior citizens. Liu also
describes how certain provisions within the current proposals
could have harmful consequences for the healthcare market and
the elderly if they are not modified and recommends provisions
that he thinks should be included in a final bill. 20 pp. CONTACT:

<B>Charting Florida's Educational Future, <BR>
</B>by Jonathan Hage
<br>
<I>Outside the Lines</I> No. 3, Foundation for Florida's Future


<P>
Director of Research for Foundation for Florida's Future, Jonathan
Hage, supports charter schools as a way to solve the problems
facing Florida public education. Charter schools are independent
public schools formed under a &quot;charter,&quot; or contract,
made between <I>organizers</I> (e.g., teachers, parents, colleges,
local organizations, or others) and <I>sponsors</I> (e.g., local
school boards, state boards of education or some other legislatively
approved and publicly accountable body). Hage provides examples
of successful charter schools in other states and addresses several
concerns that communities might have about them. Among the concerns
Hage addresses are: &quot;Charter schools won't be regulated and
children will be hurt&quot;; &quot;Charter schools are just another
passing fad&quot;; &quot;Charter schools will take money from
traditional public schools&quot;; &quot;Charter schools will open
the door to religious involvement&quot;; and &quot;Charter schools
will serve the 'elite' students, not the poor at-risk.&quot; Based
on his research, Hage concludes that charter schools will empower
parents to have more control over their children's education and
that schools will be held more accountable for their performance.

<B>How Much More do We Have to Spend to Achieve a Totally Illiterate
Society?</B> <BR>
by Dwight Williams 
<br>
<I>Independence Issue Paper</I> No. 9, Independence Institute


<P>
Dwight Williams, Research Associate at The Independence Institute,
sheds light on the perplexing question: &quot;Why has academic
achievement declined or stagnated in Colorado and the rest of
the United States despite the tremendous increase in education
spending in recent decades?&quot; Williams shows that there is
no correlation between more school spending and higher achievement.
For example, total spending on education in Colorado grew 1730
percent from 1964 to 1994, despite this, over the same period
of time, Colorado student's national test scores remained static.
Also, because so much school revenue is spent on social conditioning
and other non-academic pursuits, only 41 percent of school days
are devoted to core academic work. Williams details steps which
public schools could take to reduce overhead, improve efficiency,
and free up resources for actual teaching-without increasing the
burden on taxpayers. 12 pp.  CONTACT: Independence Institute,

<B>Making Schools Work: Spending and Student Achievement, </B>by
Eric Hanushek
<br>
<I>Policy Study</I> No. 68, The Heartland Institute

<P>
Eric Hanushek, Professor of Economics and Public Policy at the
University of Rochester, found that real spending on public education
in the U.S. is rising rapidly.  Despite this, student-teacher
and student-staff ratios have fallen, and student achievement
is either flat or falling. According to the study, three problems
largely explain the inefficiency of public education today: 1)
disregard for efficiency and productivity; 2) absence of performance
incentives; and 3) public schools don't learn from experience.
Hanushek concludes that only when public educators focus on making
efficiency and productivity a priority among educators and administrators
will student achievement improve. 28 pp.  CONTACT: The Heartland

Emory University Clinical Professor Brenda Fitzgerald  writes
that while Congress tries to reform Medicare,  they should look
at the innovative ways that private corporations have cut costs

A book draft entitled <I>School Choice: The Cultural Logic of

much attention in newspapers and in education circles due to a
widely distributed Harvard press release. The book contains research
from nine different reports on school choice and includes an introduction

the manuscript draft from several experts in the field of education
including: former Milwaukee Superintendent of Public Schools Howard
Fuller, President of Charter Schools Strategies Inc.; Joe Nathan,
Director of Center for School Change at the Hubert Humphrey Institute

<B>Natural Resource Damages: A Legal, Economic, and Policy Analysis,</B>
edited by Richard B. Stewart
<br>
National Legal Center for the Public Interest

<P>
This book addresses the emerging area of environmental law known
as &quot;natural resource damages&quot;(NRD), in a series of legal
and economic essays. Natural resource damages is a form of environmental
liability established by Superfund, the Oil Pollution Act, and
other federal and state statutes. These laws provide that public
(principally governmental) &quot;trustees&quot; can sue those
entities (principally private) held liable for damages to natural
resources.  As the monograph's Editor, Richard B. Stewart, former
head of the U.S. Department of Justice's Environment and Natural
Resources Division, points out that natural resource damages law
is an awakening &quot;sleeping giant.&quot; He writes that it
will become increasingly important for American businesses to
become aware of NRD's implications. According to Stewart, NRD
threatens U.S. business with potentially enormous liabilities
and massive transaction costs. This book attempts to identify
serious flaws in the existing system and suggests alternative
approaches that would protect natural resources without placing
an enormous liability upon U.S. businesses. 208 pp.  CONTACT:

In this comprehensive study, Peron concludes that people in such
population-control targeted areas as Africa are not victims of
overpopulation, rather, they are victims of inept governments
that have attempted to impose socialism and regulated economies
on countries that can't afford these wealth-destroying policies.

people to keep what they produce; and the people will produce.&quot;

Foundation of America

<P>
Land trusts were originally a perfect vehicle for privatized environmental
protection, according to retired civil and environmental engineer
Carol LaGrasse. Today, however, colossal environmental land brokerage
organizations are a channel for innocent, environmentally minded
citizen donors to unknowingly pool their resources with the taxing
power of state and federal governments to wrest land from private
ownership. LaGrasse writes that land trusts are exempt from the
possible subjection to demands by citizens for information under
the Freedom of Information laws. So, these groups can, in effect,
perform government functions without public scrutiny or responsibility.
LaGrasse points out that non-profit land trusts are serving primarily
as real estate brokers for government and asks the question: &quot;why
should local citizens, economically restricted by land preservation,
grant a tax exemption to land trusts to absorb a tax shift caused
by their wholesale land acquisitions, contrary to the community
interests?&quot; 16 pp.  CONTACT: The Property Rights Foundation

<B>How Washington Subverts Your Local Sheriff: The Bipartisan
Assault on Local Law Enforcement, </B>by Edwin Meese, III &amp;
Rhett DeHart
<br>
<I>Policy Review </I>No. 75, The Heritage Foundation

<P>
Edwin Meese, III, former Attorney General under President Reagan,
and Rhett DeHart, Special Counsel to Mr. Meese, show how Congress's
massive federalization of crimes has served to undermine local
law enforcement. According to the authors, the case against federalization
of crime includes the following: nationalizing crime contradicts
constitutional principles; violates double jeopardy; incurs unnecessary
expense; undermines state experimentation; and shifts accountability.
The proper role of the federal government, according to Meese
and DeHart, can best be described by the word &quot;limited.&quot;
There are only two broad areas of criminal jurisdiction where
the federal government should be involved. The first, crime against
the sovereignty of the United States, is concerned with clearly
federal issues such as treason, counterfeiting, and national security
violations. The second area of federal criminal jurisdiction is
limited to narrowly defined, significant interstate, or international,
crime. Furthermore, the federal government is best suite to provide
local officials with technological assistance and a database of
crime statistics as well as criminal histories and fingerprints.
Although both authors recognize that crime is a problem that affects
the entire nation, they write that &quot;both constitutional tradition
and practical experience demonstrate that it is most effectively
fought at the state and local level.&quot; CONTACT: Brendan O'Scannlain,

Jackson Institute

<P>
James Wootton, President of the Safe Streets Alliance, presents
a case for the policy known as &quot;Truth in Sentencing.&quot;
This policy seeks to fix the critical problem of early release
of violent offenders. Truth-in-Sentencing would abolish parole
and other early release programs for violent criminals and would
keep them incarcerated for at least 85 percent of their sentences.
Such an approach, similar to that in place in the federal prison
system, would greatly strengthen Tennessee's criminal justice
system by ending the current practice of allowing the majority
of violent offenders sentenced to prison to serve only a fraction
of their sentence, writes Wootton. The study illustrates that
the direct costs of allowing a violent criminal to remain on the
streets far outweigh the costs of keeping an offender in prison.

<P>
This paper evaluates the prison expansion program which has been
underway in Wisconsin since the late 1970's. Among its findings:
1) increased incarceration is a major reason for an 18% cut in
Wisconsin's crime rate between 1980 and the end of 1994; 2) while
prison costs are a growing share of the state's budget, on a per
capita basis they were a modest $46 a year in 1994; and 3) more
unskilled youths, a continuing increase in unstable, single parent
families, and an apparent departure from the state's successful
prison expansion policy, all portend an increase in crime in Wisconsin.
The study concludes that Wisconsin's prison policy has been effective
and that it warrants review as the state decides whether additional
prison space should remain a priority. 32 pp.  CONTACT: Wisconsin

<B>Three Years of the Americans With Disabilities Act: Lessons

National Legal Center for the Public Interest

<P>
The broad and far-reaching language of the Americans with Disabilities
Act (ADA) left many employers uncertain and confused about its
requirements when it was first enacted five years ago, according
to former NLCPI staff member Mark Parenti. In order to determine
where the law has become more settled and clear, and where it
still presents employers with uncertainty, the first part of this
paper examines how the courts and the executive branch have applied
and enforced the ADA. The second part of the study addresses the
overlap and conflict between ADA provisions and other federal
laws governing the workplace. The paper concludes that the courts
are doing the job of staking out limits to the Act's uncertain
requirements and defining its vague language-a job that Congress
and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission neglected. 67

developments during the 1994-95 term: 1) the constitutional rules
affecting race, free speech, religious expression, congressional
powers, and federalism were tilted sharply to the right; 2) Justice
Thomas's intellectual emergence was rooted in the thought of the
framers; 3) the four-justice liberal bloc looked wistfully to
the judicial activism that characterized the Court from 1937 on;
and 4) only 82 opinions were written last term, fewer than in
any year since 1956, but, comments Forte, they were among the
best-crafted in decades. 6 pp. CONTACT: <I>The World &amp; I</I>,

<B>Taking Aim at Gun Control</B>
<br>
<I>Executive Summary</I> No. 69, The Heartland Institute

<P>
This report attempts to debunk the myths of gun control, offering
an overview of several pivotal issues in the gun control debate.
Several researchers reveal their findings that there is little
or no connection between gun control and crime and help explain
why the record on gun control is so poor. The paper concludes
that firearms are not the root of the problem of violence and
arguably are almost completely divorced from it. &quot;As long
as some people have little or nothing to lose by spending their

This issue's feature article by Noel Card, <I>&quot;The States'
Federalism Summit: Restoring Balance in the Federal System,&quot;
</I>details how the summit was designed to explore ways in which
state leaders can play a role in &quot;reviving a strong, but
limited, national government.&quot; After listening to constitutional
scholars and colleagues discuss and debate the issue, Summit participants
developed a list of four approaches to be explored to help restore
balance between the states and the federal government: 1) a federalism
act to enhance the political safeguards of federalism and give
states more voice in congressional deliberations; 2) a mechanism
to provide the people of the states, through their legislatures,
the power to require the Congress to reconsider laws, specific
provisions of laws, or regulations that interfere with state authority;
3) a mechanism for the states to propose specific amendments to
the U.S. Constitution subject to ratification by the U.S. Congress;
4) statutory remedies and/or constitutional reforms to address
the problems of conditions attached to spending grants, regulations
and mandates. Also included in this issue is an editorial by ALEC's
National Chairman, State Senator Ray Powers (Colorado), entitled
&quot;Memo to Washington: Don't Tread on Us.&quot; In the editorial
Powers praises the &quot;snowballing trend in American politics-state

<B>Robert Wood Johnson Foundation: One Philanthropy's Web of State
Health Care Initiatives, </B>by Genevieve M. Young
<br>
<I>Organization Trends</I>, August 1995

<P>
State health reform proposals were especially prominent during
the 1992 election campaign and again in 1993. The effect of those
high profile proposals created an impression in the media and
among the public that rhetoric concerning a &quot;crisis&quot;
in health care had an objective, verifiable reality. However,
Genevieve Young, a Washington, D.C. attorney, demonstrates that
this &quot;crisis&quot; was the creation of a well-funded, highly
organized campaign by special interests bent on imposing their
vision of health care on the rest of us. Chief among these special
interests was the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Young sheds
light on the Foundation's activities, particularly its efforts
at the state level. She exposes a complex web of relationships
between the Foundation and various government entities, working
groups, commissions, and contractors-all designed to further the
cause of government-run health care.<I> </I>6 pp. CONTACT: Capital

<B>Justice Department's Efforts at Social Engineering Defeated</B>
<P>
ALF represented New Jersey firefighter candidates who had taken
a 1995 physical performance test to determine which candidates
were eligible to be hired as firefighters and in what order. The
Justice Department, however, did not like the results of the test
because not enough minority candidates did well and instructed
Newark to ignore the 1995 list and continue to hire from a list
generated by a 1992 exam.
<P>
The United States District Court of New Jersey agreed with ALF's
position and pointed out to the Justice Department that a test
had been devised several years earlier based on the best technical
advice and that that test had been approved by the United States,
the State of New Jersey and 12 cities of New Jersey which were
subject to an earlier consent decree concerning &quot;goals&quot;
for hiring firefighters. He further pointed out that when the
test had been given in 1992, the Justice Department had not objected
to the results. The <I>same</I> test was given in 1995, but because
the Justice Department did not like the results, it objected even
though the test was the one that it helped set up and approve.
The judge ordered that the State of New Jersey certify the 1995
list for hiring and scrap the 1992 list.

<B>DEFENDERS OF PROPERTY RIGHTS</B>

<P>
<B>Defenders Bring Suit Against City of Pacific Grove and State
of California for Violating Constitution  </B>
<P>
Defenders of Property Rights has filed suit in United States District
Court on behalf of Pacific Grove property owner Stephen J.L. Page.
The complaint alleges, among other things, that the City of Pacific
Grove, certain city officials, and the California Coastal Commission
denied him the approvals to build a home on residential property
in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S.
Constitution
<P>
These constitutional violations stem from Mr. Page's 1989 decision
to purchase a 1.08-acre parcel of oceanfront property in a subdivided,
fully developed residential area of Pacific Grove.  He was forced
to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars and countless hours
attending duplicative hearings and responding to unnecessary conditions
imposed upon his attempt to use his land.  Yet-six years later
-he still lacks the necessary government approvals to build his
home.  
<P>
Pacific Grove's desire to keep the land as &quot;open space&quot;
was evident when Mr. Page first intended to purchase the land,
and voluntarily agreed to delay his purchase for an entire year
in order to allow the city time to collect money to buy the lot
itself.  Having failed to raise the requisite funds to legitimately
acquire the land, the city deliberately schemed to maintain the
land as open space without paying for it by refusing to grant
a building permit.
<P>
Chief among the tactics employed by both the city and the Coastal
Commission was the imposition of multiple, onerous, and costly
conditions that must be met to obtain a permit.  For example,
Mr. Page must set aside eighty-five percent of his land as &quot;open
space&quot; (while paying taxes on 100% of the land).  Even if
he is allowed to build a home, he will not be able to: erect any
fencing on his land, including fencing to exclude trespassers;
erect any exterior light or even a flagpole without prior government
approval; repair his septic system; or remove any hazardous substance
or diseased plants from his yard.  
<P>
<B>Defenders in Face Off with FAA over Proposed Taking in Farmland</B>
<P>
Defenders helped win a victory in a recent dispute involving the
Federal Aviation Administration in New Bloomfield, Missouri. The
FAA, in attempting to purchase air rights for a new radar tower,
was taking more than the air space: property owners were told
that their continued use of the underlying property could interfere
with the radar's well, although the FAA was not going to compensate
them for the loss of those rights.
<P>
After intense media scrutiny and public opposition, the FAA decided
that it did not need to purchase the air rights after all, and
have assured the property owners that the present and intended
future use of their farmland will not be restricted due to the
radar.
<P>
<B>Defenders Obtains Day in Court for <BR>
Property Owner</B>
<P>
In <I>Sudarsky v. City of New York,</I> Defenders argued that
the City of New York unconstitutionally took Peter Sudarsky's
property through zoning regulation, and urged the court to hear
the merits of the case. In 1986, Mr. Sudarsky attempted to develop
a seventeen-story building on prime commercial real estate in
Manhattan. The City of New York held up the development under
the guise of needing an easement to expand the subway, and in
the meantime downzoned the property, foiling Mr. Sudarsky's development
plans.
<P>
After several years and several courts, including a petition to
the United States Supreme Court (which was denied), the case still
has not gone to trial. Nevertheless, the New York Supreme Court
has just reversed a grant of summary judgment for defendants and
reinstated the claim. Mr. Sudarsky will finally get his day in
court and a chance to prove his takings claim.

<B>Consent Decree Allows Teen Challenge to Continue Faith-based
Healing</B>
<P>
Through a negotiated settlement engineered by the Institute for
Justice, the Texas Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse (TCADA)
removed licensing requirements from Teen Challenge in San Antonio;
allowing the nationally acclaimed program to continue its healing
work on behalf of those addicted to drugs and alcohol. The consent
decree expressly recognizes Teen Challenge's right to continue
its current method of operation without a license or other state
imposed requirements that would interfere with Teen Challenge
ministry. Teen Challenge, which has an outstanding track record
in assisting addiction through a Christian faith-based program
was forced by the State of Texas to comply with secular credentialling
and training requirements which treat addiction as a disease that
can never be fully cured and that requires extensive psychological
counseling and therapeutic treatment.

<B>The Fight for School Choice in Milwaukee</B>

Civil Liberties Union, and the People for the American Way. The
plaintiffs argue that the program violates the first amendment
and a variety of state constitutional provisions.
<P>
Last month the Institute successfully opposed the NAACP's motion
to intervene in the lawsuit, and has coordinated <I>amicus</I>
support for the program. Oral arguments are set for February 1996.

<B>Landmark Wins Key Education <BR>
Reform Victory</B>
<P>
In another victory for education reform, the Pennsylvania Supreme
Court has ruled in favor of Landmark's client, the Wilkinsburg
School District, and has allowed the continued private management
of the district's Turner Elementary School.
<P>
The school district is undertaking a remarkable effort to restructure
the education program at one small elementary school. Against
the backdrop of one of the most dismal educational achievement
records imaginable, the school board is allowing a private firm
to manage and operate the school.
<P>
Despite repeated attempts by the National Education Association
to prevent it, Turner Elementary School opened under private management
on September 5, 1995 pending review by the Pennsylvania Supreme
Court. This is believed to be the first time in the nation that
a public school has been totally privatized.
<P>
The state supreme court upheld the district's effort by dissolving
a preliminary injunction, dismissing contempt charges against
school board members and ordering the trial court to hold another
hearing on the union's pending motion for a permanent injunction.
However, in its remand to the trial court, the supreme court took
the unusual step of addressing certain constitutional issues prior
to the hearing. Agreeing with the position advanced by Landmark,
the majority stated that &quot;even if the School Code were to
be interpreted to prohibit subcontracting of teachers...there
may be other conditions, which the school district insists there
are, which would render this application of the Public School
Code unconstitutional.&quot;

<B>Court's Price of Admission too High</B>
<P>
In a petition for <I>writ of certiori </I>filed recently, MSLF
requested that the Supreme Court hear <I>Laguna Gatuna, Inc. v.
Carol M. Browner, et al., </I>a case in which a New Mexico man
has been driven out of business by a cease and desist order issued
by EPA following its determination that the man's land is &quot;waters
of the United States&quot; under the Clean Water Act.
<P>
For years, Larry Squires used his land to dispose of waters produced
by southeastern New Mexico's important oil and gas industry. Although
EPA had told Squires previously that his lands were not &quot;waters
of the United States,&quot; in 1991 it changed its mind. In 1992,
EPA served Squires with a cease and desist order preventing him
from using his land. When his company was driven out of business,
Squires asked MSLF to represent him in suing EPA.
<P>
Squires contended that EPA's decision that his land fell under
the Clean Water Act was illegal. EPA asserted that Squires could
not sue until he violated the cease and desist order. If Squires
violated the EPA order, he would face penalties of $25,000 and
three years in prison, administrative fines of up to $125,000,
and a &quot;knowing&quot; penalty of $50,000 per day, plus three
years in prison.
<P>
A federal district court agreed with EPA. An appeal to the Tenth
Circuit Court of Appeals yielded the following decision in June:
&quot;Laguna's policy argument that it should not be necessary
to violate an EPA order and risk civil and criminal penalties
to obtain judicial review is well taken. Nevertheless...we reject
Laguna's conclusion such a situation is constitutionally intolerable.&quot;
<P>
In asking the Supreme Court to hear Laguna's case, MSLF asserts
that the Tenth Circuit's decision conflicts with the Constitution's
Fifth Amendment requirement that &quot;[n]o person shall...be
deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of
law,&quot; as well as numerous Supreme Court decisions that &quot;individuals
must receive notice and an opportunity to be heard before the
Government deprives them of property.&quot;

<B>City of Tigard Rebuffs U.S. Supreme Court </B>
<P>
On August 29th, the Tigard City Council voted to reinstate the
same bikepath/greenway conditions on the Dolan's A-Boy plumbing
store building permit that the United States Supreme Court struck
down in the highly publicized landmark property rights case, <I>Dolan
v. City of Tigard</I>.
<P>
In June last year, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the city had
failed to prove &quot;rough proportionality&quot; between the
impact of an expanded plumbing store building and the city's requirement
that the Dolans give up 10% of their land for a public bikepath
and greenway along Fanno Creek. Although the U.S. Supreme Court
was skeptical that Tigard could meet the proportionality test,
it remanded the case back to the city to give it an opportunity
to do so. During the months of inaction on the part of the city,
it did not withdraw the unconstitutional conditions, revise them,
or try to justify them. The Dolans then filed a legal action in
circuit court for damages caused by the city's unconstitutional
actions.
<P>
The city eventually instituted proceedings in which they attempted
to establish the required connection between impact of the building
and the bikepath/greenway conditions.
<P>
The Dolans have tried to settle with the city by agreeing to conditions
that would accommodate the city's bikepath and greenway needs
as well as the building. In fact, the city's staff proposed virtually
the same compromise, but later the city decided to reimpose essentially
what it had imposed four years before.

<B>Texas Immigration Suit Supported on Appeal</B>
<P>
Joined by Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison and Representative Jack
Fields, WLF filed a brief in the Fifth Circuit in support of Texas'
position in <I>Texas v. U.S.</I>, the lawsuit brought to compel
the federal government to enforce immigration laws adequately
or to compensate Texas for the fiscal burdens resulting from inadequate
enforcement. WLF argued in its brief that if the federal government
fails to control illegal immigration adequately, the result is
a massive unfunded mandate imposed upon the states to provide

cannot impose without compensatory funding.

<B>Anti-Gang Injunction Supported in California Supreme Court</B>

WLF filed a brief in the California Supreme Court in support of

a suit over the constitutionality of an injunction to stop gang
activity by the defendants.  The defendants were found to have
been part of two street gangs, the &quot;Varrio Surreno Treces&quot;
(VST) and &quot;Varrio Surreno Locos&quot; (VSL), that maintained
a reign of terror in the community of Rocksprings, a neighborhood
in San Jose. The City obtained an injunction to abate these activities
as a public nuisance. The state appellate court, however, struck
down many provisions of the injunction as a violation of the gang
members' First Amendment rights, WLF argued that the First Amendment
did not forbid an injunction to limit the congregating of known
gang members.

<h3>Heritage Foundation Balanced Budget Talking Points</h3>
<P></center>
 <li><a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi69.html">Balanced Budget Talking Points #1</a>: <b>What a Balanced Federal Budget with Tax Cuts Would Mean to the Economy,</b> by William Beach and John Barry. <BR>

<P>
See Taxation &amp; Budget page 6, 8 pp. (<I>F.Y.I. </I>#69)<BR>

<P>
<li><a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi76.html">Balanced Budget Talking Points #2</a>: <b>Who Will Benefit From Cuts in Capital Gains Taxes? </b> by William Beach <BR>

<P>
Beach points out that there are three major reasons why adopting
capital gains tax changes as defined in the Balance Budget Act
of 1995 will benefit nearly every American. First, the benefits
of cutting capital gains taxes go mostly to lower and middle income
tax-payers rather than to the wealthy. Second, economists who
have analyzed the economic effects of balancing the federal budget
while simultaneously cutting taxes (including the capital gains
tax) have all concluded that these policy changes result in widespread
economic benefits through a stronger, more productive economy.
And third, reducing the tax rate for capital gains actually would
increase tax revenues from tax-payers who own most appreciated
assets. 4 pp. (<I>F.Y.I. </I>#76)

 <li><a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi77.html">Balanced Budget Talking Points #3</a>: <b>What a Balanced Federal Budget With Tax Cuts Would Mean For Family College Costs,</b>
by John Barry <BR>

<P>
Among Barry's findings, the Balanced Budget Act developed by Congress
would mean the following: American families, over time, could
save an additional $14,066 per child in today's dollars to fund
college education costs as a result of the $500-per-child tax
credit; and an average student could save more than $414 over
the life of a 10-year student loan as a result of lower interest
rates. 3 pp. (<I>F.Y.I.</I> #77)

 <li><a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi75.html">Balanced Budget Talking Points #4</a>: <b>The $500-per-Child Tax Credit Means One Month's Food and Mortgage For a Typical American Family</b>
by Scott Hodge <BR>

<P>
Scott Hodge, Heritage Foundation Fellow in Federal Budgetary Affairs,
points out that a $500 tax cut for each child in working families
is not an insignificant amount of money, as many liberals believe.
Hodge shows that this tax cut would pump over $22 billion per
year into family budgets across the country. According to Hodge
millions of families will benefit, and Congress's $500-per-child
tax credit would eliminate the entire income tax burden for 3.5
million taxpayers caring for 8.7 children. 19 pp. (<I>F.Y.I.</I>
#75)
<P>
 <li><a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi78.html">Balanced Budget Talking Points #5</a>: <b>Clinton's $300-per-Child Tax Cut Plan Denies Tax Relief to 23 Million Children,</b> by Scott Hodge<BR>

<P>
Hodge shows that the Balanced Budget Act vetoed by President Clinton
on December 6th (with its $500-per-child tax cut for all children
in families earning up to $110,000) compared with Clinton's budget
(with its provision for a $300-per-child tax credit for dependent
children below age 13 in families with annual incomes below $75,000)
would benefit 5.4 million more low-income working families with
children earning below $24,000 per year, who would be denied the
$300 child tax credit under the Clinton plan. 8 pp. (<I>F.Y.I.</I>

<P>
 <li><a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi79.html">Balanced Budget Talking Points #6</a>: <b>What a Balanced Federal Budget With Tax Cuts Would Mean For Current and Future Retirees,</b>
by John Barry
<P>
Barry has found that under the congressional balanced budget plan
current retirees would gain additional after-tax income from a
reduction in the capital gains tax; and retirees have a significant
increase in real purchasing power over the next ten years due
to decreased inflation. Future retirees would benefit under the
Congressional proposal with the proposed &quot;super IRA&quot;
compared with saving the same amount in a conventional IRA; a
young couple raising one newborn child could save significantly
for their retirement by saving the $500-per-child annual tax credit,
while a young couple buying a home could save more for their retirement
from decreased monthly mortgage payments. 6 pp. (<I>F.Y.I.</I>

<P>
 <li><a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/fyi80.html">Balanced Budget Talking Points #7</a>: <b>What Congress's Balanced Budget With Tax Cuts Would Mean For Housing,</B> by William Beach <BR>

<P>
According to an econometric analysis by William Beach, adoption
of the spending and tax policy changes contained in the Balanced
Budget Act of 1995 would likely lead to: 104,000 additional housing
starts worth $11 billion over the period 1996 through 2002; new
or improved housing for 1.8 million Americans; a drop in mortgage
interests rates, with total payments on a $100,000 mortgage about
$10,000 less in today's dollars over 30 years than a mortgage
purchased under current budget and tax law; and a 4 percent drop
in the cost of housing by 2002 (principally through decreases
in the cost of capital and lower interests rates), with the value
of existing housing maintained at or near current levels by the
growing demand for new homes. 3 pp. (<I>F.Y.I.</I> #80)

<h2>November <i>Insider</i>: On the Docket: A Look Ahead at the Supreme Court</h2></center><p>
by Roger Clegg, Vice President, National Legal Center for the Public Interest  <br>
<hr>
<br>


Following its usual practice, the Supreme Court commenced its new term on the first Monday in October. Decisions in the cases argued before the Court should be handed down before the 1995-96 term is completed at the end of next June. Here is a brief overview of the cases to watch.
<P>
One of the most controversial cases is Romer v. Evans, where a Colorado state constitutional amendment barring protected status for homosexuals is being challenged as a denial of "equal protection of the laws," in violation of the U.S. Constitution's Fourteenth Amendment. When the case was argued last month, the Colorado official defending the law got a chilly reception from the Court. But it can be risky to predict a case's outcome based only on how the oral argument goes.
<P>
Another case that was recently argued is BMW of North America Incorporated v. Gore, which spotlights out-of-control jury damage awards. An Alabama jury awarded $4 million to a doctor who complained about his new car's paint job. The state supreme court cut it back to "only" $2 million, which understandably enough did not satisfy the defendant. The Court has taken a number of punitive damage cases in recent years, but has yet to offer clear guidance to the lower courts on how to tell when an award is unconstitutionally "excessive."
<P>
Last term the Court handed down a number of important civil rights cases, most of them conservative victories, as a slender majority of the justices insisted that racial preferences of all kinds be given strict scrutiny. This term's most important cases in this category_Shaw v. Hunt and Bush v. Vera_involve voting rights, and in particular the practice of drawing district boundaries with an eye toward "politically correct" racial outcomes. With the Clinton administration committed to racial preferences, and Congress so far unwilling to act, the Court appears to be the only branch of the federal government willing to resist racial balkanization.
Another important civil rights case, which the Court just recently 
agreed to hear, is United States v. Virginia. This is the "VMI case," challenging the constitutionality of single sex, state-run military academies, namely the Virginia Military Institute and the Citadel. This controversy drew a great deal of attention last summer when Shannon Faulkner briefly attended the Citadel.
<P>
Two other cases likely to generate publicity are Bennis v. Michigan, in which a wife is challenging the forfeiture of the family car when her husband used it to pick up a prostitute, and Lewis v. Casey, in which Arizona's state-prison libraries were ordered by a federal judge to provide inmates with a variety of amenities. Bennis is important because law-enforcement agencies have been very aggressive recently in using forfeiture laws, especially against drug dealers. Lewis provides the Court with a chance to cut back on the federal judiciary's micromanagement of state prison systems_just as it cut back on its micromanagement of school systems last term in Missouri v. Jenkins.
<P>
Other important cases which the Supreme Court will hear this year involve Indian gambling casinos, whether there is a jury-trial right in patent cases, claims against the manufacturers of Agent Orange, whether the federal census illegally undercounted members of minority groups, the First Amendment implication of limits on liquor advertising, the extent to which some computer software can be copyrighted, the sentencing in the Rodney King case, and whether telephone companies can be prevented by the federal government from getting into the cable television business.
<P>
Finally, keep in mind that the Court has so far scheduled relatively few cases to be heard this term, even considering the fact that its docket has shrunk dramatically from just a few years ago. Consequently, the Court is expected to add quite a few cases to its agenda over the next few weeks and months.

<b>Forced Justice: School Desegregation and the Law</b><br>
by David J. Armor, Oxford University Press (1995)
<P>
In his new book, <i>Forced Justice: School Desegregation and the Law</i> (Oxford University Press), David J. Armor, Research Professor at the Institute of Public Policy at George Mason University, offers his readers a thoroughly professional overview of one of the most controversial areas of public policies of the last forty years -- school desegregation. A conservative, Armor writes in a non-threatening, academic style that allows him to tread in controversial academic waters and reach conservative conclusions without scaring away the ideologically liberal reader. One suspects that even the most defiant apologist of forced busing and race-conscious education policies will, upon reading this book, be forced to admit that the world is a more complicated place than it appeared to be in 1954 when the Supreme Court rendered its decision in Brown v. Board of Education.
Brown undoubtedly contributed to the sea change in popular opinion on racial issues in this country, as illustrated by polling data that shows the steady upward movement in the percentage of whites who believe that black and white students should attend the same schools -- from about one-third in 1942 to 95 percent in 1990. But the decision also legitimized one of the most pernicious legal developments of our time, the judicial use of social science theory in deciding important constitutional law cases. In this case, the Court accepted the questionable "harm and benefit" thesis, which Armor defines as the notion that: 
<P><bq>
"school desegregation is harmful to the social, psychological, and educational development of children, both minority and white, and that school desegregation is beneficial for undoing or at least ameliorating the damages from segregation and discrimination." 

</bq><P>
Have the last four decades been kind to this thesis? After an exhaustive review of the research literature, Armor concludes that academic achievement among blacks is most strongly related, not to whether the student sits in a desegregated classroom, but to the "educational and economic characteristics" of his family and even to federal compensatory programs such as the Chapter 1 program. Armor also summarizes the research findings on the question of whether desegregation enhances black self-esteem, another key element of the harm and benefit thesis, and concludes: 
<P>
The research on black self-esteem over the past thirty years not only fails to support the harm and benefit thesis, then, but indeed seems to turn the thesis on its head. First, school segregation appears not to harm self-esteem of black students in the first place...and in many cases segregated black students have higher self-esteem than white students. Second, desegregation not only fails to improve black self-esteem but may in fact <b>lower it</b>. (emphasis added)
<P>
If, in 1954, the Court had resisted the temptation to substitute shaky social science for sound constitutional principles, how many young schoolchildren, both black and white, might have been spared those long and painful bus rides to distant schools to fulfill the social engineer's dream of perfect racial integration in the schools?  
<P>
What does the research literature tell us about whether whites abandon public school systems that are implementing court-ordered desegregation plans, the so-called phenomena of "white flight"? As Armor describes it, in 1975 social scientists began to suspect that "desegregation was accelerating white flight above and beyond that caused by other demographic processes." Armor himself conducted a comprehensive study of fifty-four court-ordered plans and found:
<P><bq>
"In central-city school districts with higher percentages of black enrollment, I found mandatory busing to raise white loss rates by three to five times that due to underlying demographic processes...[T]his study estimated that over a five-year period about half of the total white enrollment loss was due to the busing plans and the other half was due to normal demographic processes such as declining birth rates and net out-migration rates."
</bq><P>
Armor suggests that inconvenience, rather than racial prejudice, may account for much of this result: "the highest no-show rate is for Los Angeles, which had the longest average busing distance of any of the plans [55 minutes for a one-way bus ride]." Elsewhere, he points to data that parents weigh the quality of the individual school, rather than race, most heavily before deciding to move their children to other schools.
<P>
Try as he might to present both sides of a rather complicated argument, Armor nonetheless leaves the reader feeling quite frustrated with the current state of affairs, both politically and in the courts.
<P>
Thanks to David Armor, we now have a better understanding of the strengths and (mostly) weaknesses of school desegregation.

The House-Senate Conference Should Agree to Rapid Deployment of Missle Defenses</b>, by Baker Spring<br>
Backgrounder No. 1054, The Heritage Foundation
<P>
Baker Spring, a senior policy analyst at The Heritage Foundation, recommends that the members of the House and Senate military oversight committees who make up the conference committee should not settle for a weak bill that postpones deployment or takes the US ballistic missile defense program down a dead-end road. Spring recommends the committee adopt the following in order to send a clear message to the administration: deploy affordable and highly effective theater missile defense systems as soon as possible; deploy at the earliest possible date an affordable and highly effective national missile defense system that can be augmented to provide a layered defense; and improve existing cruise missile defense capabilities. This paper includes an appendix detailing recommended changes to the House and Senate versions of the bill as well as outling recommended goals for the conference committee, broken down into the following areas: statements of policy; theater missile defense; national missile defense; the future of the ABM Treay; interpreting the ABM Treaty; reporting requirements; and funding for missile defense. 11 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.

Mexico: Policy Failure, Moral Hazard, and Market Solutions, </b>by W. Lee Hoskins and James W. Coons<br>

Policy Analysis No. 243, Cato Institute
<P>
Lee Hoskins and James Coons, respectively the CEO and vice president of the Huntington National Bank in Columbus, Ohio, point out that for the fourth time in the past 20 years, the Mexican economy is in financial distress, largely due to the poor monetary policies pursued by Mexican officials. The authors suggest that the consistent American practice of lending money to the Mexican government has created a set of perverse incentives which ensure the "crisis" will reappear on an even larger scale. Hoskins and Coons suggest that the best course for the future is to encourage market forces, stronger private property rights, price stability, and a floating exchange rate for the peso. The authors write, "The United States should pass legislation that eliminates the Treasury's ability to make foreign loans and that removes the ability of the Federal Reserve to extend credit to foreign central banks directly or indirectly by funding the Exchange Stabilization Fund." 18 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200.

Ukraine: Back from the Brink, </b> by Taras Kuzio
<br>
European Security Study No. 23, Institute for European Defence and Strategic Studies
<P>
Taras Kuzio, research fellow for the Centre for Russian and East European studies at the University of Birmingham, argues that Ukraine, more so than any other former Soviet Republic, was left with one of the most difficult legacies. According to the author, Ukraine is divided between an eastern region with a large population of Russian speakers and culture and a western area in which traditional Ukrainian language and culture predominate. Kuzio presents his analysis of the tenure of the Ukraine's president, Leonid Kravchuk and describes his efforts to handle the early stages of the dissolution of the Soviet Union, stressing reconciliation and consensus and thus avoiding ethnic tension and social instability. The author then presents a look at how the new president, Leonid Kuchma, has been able to address the problems that Kravchuk did not deal with effectively: economic and social stagnation and an increasing drift in Ukrainian foreign policy. The latter half of this paper addresses three lingering problems for Ukraine: 1) the building of a truly democratic political system is still inhibited by electoral apathy and the weakness of political parties; 2) while regional tensions have abated, the evolution of a generally accepted Ukrainian identity will be necessary; and 3) progress towards the settlement of the Crimean issue and Ukraine's general security might  be threatened by a more aggressively nationalistic Russian leader in the future. Kuzio concludes, "Western support for an independent Ukraine confident within its borders will ensure European security and stability at a crucial moment in the post-soviet transition process." 37 pp. CONTACT: Institute for European Defence and Strategic Studies, St. George's House, 14/17 Wells Street, London, W1P 3FP ENGLAND, 0171-637-2152, or fax 0171-637-2155.

America's Stake in Hong Kong, </b> by Brett C. Lippencott
<br>
Asian Studies Center Backgrounder No. 137, The Heritage Foundation
<P>
Brett Lippencott, policy analyst in The Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center, argues that the strong showing of pro-democracy candidates in Hong Kong's October legislative elections is a clear signal that the people do not trust Beijing's pledges to respect their autonomy and freedoms. Lippencott demonstrates that Hong Kong is America's 12th largest trading partner, with 1994 two-way trade in excess of $21 billion. The paper maintains that the US has a direct interest in Beijing's compliance with its pledges to respect Hong Kong's autonomy. Lippencott suggests the following conditions of the Basic Law which Beijing must respect after 1997: continuation of Hong Kong's autonomy and prosperity; the existence of a free market; commitment to such democratic and open institutions as a free press; preservation of Hong Kong's apolitical, independent civil service; the rule of law built upon the inviolability of human rights and civil liberties; maintenance of Hong Kong's independence in fiscal and taxation matters; and cooperation between Hong Kong and foreign law enforcement authorities. 7 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.

How to Close Down the Department of Labor</b> by Mark Wilson
<br>
Backgrounder No. 1058, The Heritage Foundation
<P>
Mark Wilson, Heritage's Rebecca Luken's Fellow in Labor Policy, reveals that the Department of Labor has become one of the most pervasive regulatory agencies in the federal government.  Wilson advocates closing this Cabinet-level department and moving key national functions to sub-Cabinet agencies or other departments. Wilson recommends that Congress take the following steps: 1) devolve financing and funding for the Unemployment Insurance Services to the states; 2) consolidate all job training programs for the economically disadvantaged into a state block grant; 3) consolidate all other job training programs into a state workforce development block grant; 4) reform the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and combine it with the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA); 5) transfer the Pension and Welfare Benefit Administration to the Social Security Administration; 6) repeal and nullify outdated labor laws, executive orders, and regulations; 7) combine the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau in a newly created sub-Cabinet agency, the Bureau of National Statistics; and 8) close down the Office of the American Workplace and nullify Executive Order 12954 (striker replacement). Wilson writes, "The 104th Congress has a rare opportunity to initiate fundamental reforms in the administration and enforcement of America's labor laws. The primary objectives of this effort should be: reduce excessive burdens on businesses and job creation while maintaining workplace health and safety, and improve labor market flexibility while maintaining basic employee protections." 29 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.

Saying Goodbye When the Job is Done: The Coming Privatization of Government-Sponsored Enterprises, </b>by Thomas H. Stanton
<br>
IPI Policy Report No. 133, The Institute for Policy Innovation
<P>
Tom Stanton, a fellow of the Center for the Study of American Government at the Johns Hopkins University, states that government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Sallie Mae pose a needless $1.5 trillion liability to taxpayers and should be privatized. Stanton writes, "Today, Farmer Mac is requesting changes to its charter that would increase taxpayer risk, and give it advantage over its private competitors. As proven by the Savings and Loan debacle, such massive taxpayer liabilities are not risk-free." The report addresses the individual situations of the Student Loan Marketing Association (Sallie Mae), the Federal Home Loan Banks, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac), the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae), the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation (Farmer Mac), and the Farm Credit System. Stanton concludes that, if the GSEs are not privatized, the taxpayer liability of GSEs will continue to grow at a rapid rate, and will only add to the total hidden taxpayer liability that lurks beyond the national debt. 22 pp. CONTACT: The Institute for Policy Innovation, 25 South Stemmons, Suite 306, Lewisville, TX  75057, 214/219-0811.

Archer Daniels Midland: A Case Study in Corporate Welfare</b>, by James Bovard
<br>
Policy Analysis No. 241, Cato Institute
<P>
James Bovard, an associate policy analyst with the Cato Institute, reveals that the Archer Daniels Midland Corporation (ADM) has been one of the most prominent recipients of corporate welfare in recent years, funding both political parties with millions of dollars of handouts in return for billion dollar windfalls from taxpayers and consumers. Bovard writes, "Thanks to federal protection of the domestic sugar industry, ethanol subsidies, subsidized grain exports, and various other programs, ADM has cost the American economy billions of dollars since 1980 and has indirectly cost Americans tens of billions of dollars in higher prices and higher taxes over that same period." This paper demonstrates how ADM has received at least 43 percent of its annual profits from products heavily subsidized or protected by the American government. Bovard puts these figures in perspective with the current debate over corporate welfare, examining the dynamics of corporate welfare by investigating ADM as a classic case study of how those subsidies are obtained, how the welfare state encourages such "rent seeking," and how such practices fundamentally corrupt the political life of a nation. 48 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200.

Constraints Upon Privatization: A Case Study of the Israeli Experience, </b> by Avi Naider
<br>
Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs
<P>
Avi Naider provides a short history of the rise of state-owned enterprises throughout the world in the post-World War II era, and the general trend of governments subsequently to divest themselves of those interests. Naider then presents a case study of privatization efforts in Israel, an example of an advanced industrial country which has generally failed to meet its own goals and standards, according to the author. This paper suggests that the most significant constraints on Israel's privatization program have been political and social, and, although technical constraints have contributed to delays, they are unable to account for the fact that despite the government's stated commitment to privatization, the number of state owned enterprises in the 1990s have actually increased. Naider probes several obstacles to reform: 1) Israel's fragmented and contentious political system; 2) the maneuvering of ministers and bureaucrats to "protect their turf;" 3) the power of the country's federated labor union; 4) the preoccupation with national security; and 5) the country's socialist legacy. To further illustrate Israel's unique experience, a chapter is dedicated to a case study of Israel Chemicals, Ltd., a pivotal divesture failure. 68 pp. CONTACT: Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs, Beit Milken, 13 Tel Hal Street, Jerusalem  92107, ISRAEL, fax 972-2-619112.

Metropolitan Economic Development in Wisconsin</b>
<br>
Report Vol. 8, No. 7, Wisconsin Policy Research Institute
<P>
This report, developed by the Urban Research Center of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, examines the impact of the recent economic growth in Wisconsin's largest metropolitan areas. The report, which uses jobs data from the Department of Industry, Labor and Human Relations, reveals several significant trends: Kenosha expands by creating jobs through small compaies, while its neighbor, Racine, remains stagnant; metropolitan Milwaukee continues to develop jobs, but at a slower rate than other large metropolitan areas; and smaller areas are experiencing a far more significant rate of job creation than the larger metropolitan areas. This report analyzes which industries grew most rapidly, whether single-site employers added more employment than establishments associated with multiple-site employers, whether existing employers are universally responsible for most employment gains in all regions, how important to overall growth employers are that added large numbers of employees, which size employer added the most employees, whether suburban areas are growing at the expense of the central cities, how much firm migration is occurring, and what are the earnings patterns. 32 pp. CONTACT: Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, 3107 N.

FDA Hazards: How FDA Red Tape Impacts Entrepreneurs and the U.S. Economy, </b> by Raymond J. Keating

Small Business Survival Foundation

Raymond Keating, chief economist with the Small Business Survival Foundation, reveals that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which has generally been held in high regard by Americans, has recently squandered much of this goodwill. At the cost of the consumer, the FDA, according to Keating, has stifled growth in many areas, including entrepreneurial medical devices, vitamins, and foods. Keating recommends bold reforms for the FDA: 1) the FDA should be scrapped in favor of a smaller agency geared toward safety and education; 2) efficacy should be left to the marketplace; 3) manufacturers and approval enterprises should be subject to the incentives of a sound legal system; 4) FDA bans on information about off-label uses of drugs should be lifted; 5) the US should negatiate and enter into agreements with other nations to recognize each other's drug and medical device approvals; and 6) incentives for investment in dynamic industries, like pharmaceuticals and medical devices, need to be enhanced. 25pp. CONTACT: Small Business Survival Foundation, 1320 Eighteenth Street, NW, Suite 200, Washington, DC 20036, 202/785-0238.

Which Tax Reform Plan is Best for America? </b>, by Daniel J. Mitchell
<br>
Backgrounder No. 1055, The Heritage Foundation
<P>
Daniel Mitchell, McKenna senior fellow in political economy at The Heritage Foundation, analyzes and grades the six current proposals for major tax reform: the Armey/Shelby flat tax, Specter flat tax, value-added tax, national sales tax, Nunn-Domenici USA tax, and the Gephardt 10 percent tax. Mitchell evaluates the tax proposals on nine different criteria, including the degree to which they lower tax rates, simplify the system, address the bias against savings and investment, and treat taxpayers fairly. This paper concludes that the plans based on the flat tax model developed by Stanford University professor Robert Hall and Hoover Institution senior fellow Alvin Rabushka score highest; direct consumption taxes also fare well, but proposals that more closely resemble the current system are graded the lowest. 16 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 6058, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail Insider@heritage.org.

Eating Out Our Substance: How Taxation Affects Saving, </b> by Gary Robbins and Aldona Robbins
<br>
Policy Report No. 131, The Institute for Policy Innovation in cooperation with Center for the New West
<P>
Gary Robbins, John M. Olin senior research fellow at IPI, and Aldona Robbins, Bradley senior research fellow at IPI, find that in order to stimulate economic growth by increasing private savings, America's tax policy must be changed to remove the penalties on saving and investment. This report confirms that America's private saving rate has declined precipitously in recent years: between 1947 and 1994, private savings averaged 12.9 percent of aftertax income; today the savings rate hovers around 7 percent. The authors report that there is a significant historical relationship between the private saving rate and the tax treatment of capital: specifically, a 10 percent increase in the aftertax rate of return to capital will result in a 7-11 percent increase in saving. The authors conclude that reducing the difference between average and marginal tax rates will reduce the adverse effect of taxes on the economy, and moving to a system that ends the multiple taxation of capital will lead to higher rates of saving, labor productivity, and economic growth. 27 pp. CONTACT: The Institute for Policy Innovation, 25 South Stemmons, Suite 306, Lewisville, TX  75057, 214/219-0811.

The ABCs of the Capital Gains Tax, </b> by Stephen Moore and John Silvia
<br>
Policy Analysis No. 242, Cato Institute
<P>
Stephen Moore, director of fiscal policy studies at the Cato Institute, and John Silvia, chief economist at Kemper Financial Services, examine the historical experience with the capital gains tax in the United States, as well as the finding of more than 50 economic studies on capital gains taxation. The authors conclude that a capital gains tax cut would: 1) substantially raise tax collections and increase tax payments by the rich; 2) increase the rate of capital formation, economic growth, and job creation throughout the year 2000; 3) unlock hundreds of billions of dollars of unrealized capital gains, thus promoting more efficient allocation of capital; and 4) expand economic opportunities for the most economically disadvantaged workers by bringing jobs and new businesses to capital-starved areas, such as America's inner cities. Finally, the study argues that the capital gains tax is so economically inefficient_because of its punitive effect on entrepreneurship, thrift, and investment_that the optimal economic policy for the United States would be to abolish the tax entirely. 63 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200.

John Liu, Heritage Foundation policy analyst for health care, and Robert Moffitt, deputy director of domestic policy studies at Heritage, provide insight into the search for ways to preserve health insurance benefits for the elderly by changing Medicare from a highly bureaucratic government program into a dynamic system based on the market principles of consumer choice and competition. This report examines the inherent flaws in the current system, revealing that from its inception, the current Medicare system encouraged central planning and price controls, bureaucracy and red tape, and government standardized benefits. Liu and Moffitt offer readers ammunition to the complicated questions that result from reforming the Medicare system in terms of funding and benefits for the elderly.

Improving Medicare: Nine Ways the House Medicare Bill Does It, </b> by John S. Tottie

Issues and Answers, Citizens for a Sound Economy
<P>
John Tottie, policy analyst at Citizens for a Sound Economy, writes, "The Medicare Preservation Act of 1995 proposed by the House leadership provides just what President Clinton's trustees of the Medicare program recently called for, `prompt, effective, and decisive action' to save Medicare." Tottie lists the following nine aspects of the House plan as major improvements in the Medicare plan: 1) the plan saves Medicare from bankruptcy by reducing the rate of spending increases; 2) it offers many private-sector alternatives, including medical savings accounts; 3) it would make it possible to provide more benefits at no extra cost; 4) it would allow beneficiaries to limit their out-of-pocket spending; 5) it allows insurers to offer beneficiaries financial incentives to spend wisely; 6) it  reduces fraud, waste, and abuse in several different ways; 7) it reduces government subsidies to Medicare recipients who do not need them; 8) it reduces unnecessary bureacracy and high administrative costs; and 9) it enable beneficiaries to escape the rationing in government-run Medicare. The author contends the House plan results in a "win-win" proposition: a better Medicare system for beneficiaries and increased savings for taxpayers. 9 pp. CONTACT: Citizens for a Sound Economy, 1250 H St., NW, Suite 700, Washington, DC  20005-3908, 202/783-3870.

According to the authors, the conferees should highlight the following issues: total expenditures, work requirements, teen-age illegitimacy, the entitlement mentality, perverse additional incentives, and shifting power to the states. Gallaway and Vedder write, "Any welfare reform must take a hard line against autopilot spending increases, the entrenched Federal bureaucracy, and teen-age illegitimacy. The Republican proposal addresses these problems head-on, while the Clinton plan takes a pass." 20 pp. CONTACT: The Institute for Policy Innovation, 25 South Stemmons, Suite 306, Lewisville, TX  75057, 214/219-0811.

Restructuring Medicare: A Long-Term Plan to Save the Medicare Program, </b> by Mark E. Litow and Peter G. Hendee
<br>
Council for Affordable Health Insurance
<P>
Mark Litow, consulting actuary for Milliman & Robertson, Inc., and Peter Hendee, consulting actuary for Odell and Associates, developed a plan that would save the Medicare program for those beneficiearies who want to remain in the system and, at the same time, offer an array of choices to those who want other choices. Under this plan, individuals would have to choose between the Medicare program and a private voucher system. For those who choose to opt out of the Medicare program, the voucher amounts could be used to purchase private health insurance coverage such as a managed care plan, a medical savings account (MSA), or any new product the market develops. Any remaining voucher balance would be deposited into an MSA and the balance could be withdrawn to pay for routine medical care, or saved for long-term care expenses. This plan would produce a savings of $297 billion over the next seven years and meets the FY 1996 Budget Resolution reducing Medicare spending growth by $270 billion over seven years. 30 pp. CONTACT: Council for Affordable Health Insurance, 112 S.

The Endangered Species Act: A Train Wreck Ahead, </b> by Thomas Lambert
<br>
Center for the Study of American Business
<P>
Thomas Lambert, adjunct research assistant at the Center for the Study of American Business, writes that without major reform of the Endangered Species Act, land use conflicts between regulators and property owners will only increase in frequency. Lambert finds the number of listed endangered domestic species will likely grow from 962 to more than 3,000 in the coming years_due to the listing of subspecies, or "bugs and slugs"_further restricting development on private land. Lambert proposes that regulators should: a) compensate landowners whose property is devalued through the Act's restrictions; b) mandate minimum scientific standards for endangered species listing decisions; and c) limit protection to "full-fledged" species. 24 pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington University, Campus Box 1208, St. Louis, MO 63130-4899, 314/935-5630.

Federal Agricultural Policy: A Harvest of Environmental Abuses, </b> by Jonathan Tolman
<br>
Competitive Enterprise Institute
<P>
Jonathan Tolman, environmental policy analyst at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, argues that environmentalists have overlooked one of the largest sources of water pollution: agricultural runoff. Tolman states that agricultural runoff is now the number one source of pollution in the nation's rivers, streams, and lakes. The author argues that the farm programs, developed in an era before commercial pesticides, fertilizers, and modern farming techniques, have had and continue to have detrimental effects on the environment. Tolman cites damage to the Everglades from the US sugar program and damage to peanut crops from the USDA peanut program. The author concludes, "Overall, consumers, taxpayers, and the environment would be better off under a free market agricultural policy. Direct and indirect payments to farmers should be eliminated and all supply control programs should be ended." 16 pp. CONTACT: Competitive Enterprise Institute, 1001 Connecticut Ave., NW, Suite 1250, Washington, DC  20036, 202/331-1010.

Going Against the Flow: The Case for Competition in Solid Waste Management, </b> by Angela Logomasini

Issues and Answers, Citizens for a Sound Economy

Angela Logomasini, adjunct analyst with Citizens for a Sound Economy, asserts that local governments' imposition of solid waste flow control_the practice of mandating that trash haulers dispose of waste at government designated facilities_creates monopoly providers of waste disposal services within a community. Logomasini demonstrates how such economic protectionism in the waste management industry has imposed huge costs on consumers, taxpayers, and the economy in general, while reducing innovation and subsidizing inefficient enterprises. The paper states that despite evidnce to the contrary, Congress is considering legislation that would bolster such laws. Logomasini advocates, "promoting a competitive system that allows the industry to seek the lowest cost options and operate efficiently." 18 pp. CONTACT: Citizens for a Sound Economy, 1250 H St., NW, Suite 700, Washington, DC  20005-3908, 202/783-3870.

CIR Challenges Racial Quotas at UT Law School</b>

The Center is representing non-minority applicants to the University of Texas Law School in the first substantive constitutional challenge to racial preferences in student admission since Board of Regents v. Bakke (1978). In August 1994, a federal district judge in Austin, Texas held that certain aspects of the law school's admission process were unconstitutional. Specifically, the court held that the consideration of minority applicants by a separate minority admissions subcommittee deprived the plaintiffs of equal protection of the law. The court also noted in dicta that separate cut-off scores for minority applicants violated the equal protection clause. However, the court failed to award meaningful monetary or injunctive relief and the case is now pending on appeal to the Fifth Circuit.

The Berkeley residents had exercised their First Amendment right by opposing the government's proposed conversion of a nearby hotel to a homeless shelter. In response to the residents' constitutionally protected activities of publishing articles and circulating a newsletter explaining the problems with the project, HUD unleashed a lengthy investigation of the residents' activities. At one point, HUD offered to close the investigation in return for the residents' agreement not to engage in similar activities in the future. At issue in this case is whether the government's actions chilled the residents' First Amendment rights.

CIR Wins Sex Discrimination Appeal Before 4th Circuit</b>

The Center is representing five male professors at Virginia Commonwealth University who claimed sex discrimination when the school gave over $400,000 in raises to female professors in 1992. The school justified this special salary increase for women by pointing to the results of an internal "Salary Equity Study" which indicated that women made $1,900 per year less, on average, than men if one fails to take into account such factors as teaching performance, publications, teaching load, and service to the community. Last year, the U.S. District Court in Richmond granted summary judgment to VCU and dismissed the case in the eve of trial. However, on August 24, 1995, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the lower court's decision and ruled that the case should be heard by a jury.

Although this makes the property ideal for light commercial uses, the local planning board is sticking with its 1915 residential designation. The only purpose served by keeping the current zoning is to provide a cheap, uncompensated way to create a "buffer zone" between the surrounding residential area and a nearby commercial district.

The program, the nation's first court-approved school choice plan, was expanded earlier this year to include religious schools. Landmark Legal Foundation represents Wisconsin state representative Polly Williams, the Milwaukee program's architect, and a group of families and students wishing to attend religious schools.
The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals recently remanded the Miller case back to the trial court with instruction to vacate its earlier decision against Landmark's families. The Seventh Circuit order noted Landmark's "victory in the legislative forum" gave Milwaukee families "exactly what they sought" in the litigation.

NELF to Help Immigrant Workers in New Hampshire</b>
<br>
NELF will represent a group of New Hampshire women who sew garments in their homes. The Department of Labor (DOL) says these women are "employees" not "independent contractors." If DOL wins, these women will lose their jobs.
The case involves Gale River Designs ("Gale River"), a small clothing maker, located in Franconia, N.H. which makes garments for catalogue retailers such as Orvis and Motherwear. Gale River employs about 20 to 25 people at its offices and factory. In addition to 8 to 10 in-house workers, it contracts out sewing to about 16 at-home "sewers" in New Hampshire, Vermont and Massachusetts.
Gale River ships unassembled pieces to the sewers who finish the garments and ship them back to Gale River. Sewers are paid on a piece-work basis. They estimate that their compensation works out to $12-15 per hour spent sewing, well above minimum wage. Most are women, some refugees, who simply cannot work outside the home because they live in remote locations or care for small children or elderly relatives. Home work for Gale River is their only employment option.
After a lengthy investigation DOL charged Gale River with $38,000 in minimum wage and overtime violations. If DOL succeeds, Gale River's costs will increase and it will have to use only in-house sewers. That will mean unemployment and a return to poverty for the sewers.

 NELF Brief Supports WalMart's Right to Enter Vermont</b>
<br>
NELF is filing an amicus brief with the Vermont Supreme Court challenging the Vermont Environmental Board's rejection of an application to construct a new WalMart in St. Albans, Vermont. The Board overruled local approvals of the project in order to impose on St. Albans its view of how the local economy should grow.
WalMart has secured a site in St. Albans already zoned for commercial use. It has obtained all required state and local permits, except the one required by ACT 250, Vermont's strict land use law. The citizens of St. Albans voted 7-1 in favor of WalMart in a recent, non-binding referendum. Nonetheless the state Environmental Board denied WalMart the needed Act 250 permit. The Board's main objection to WalMart is that the new store would have a negative "net economic impact." The Board credited two economists' testimony that WalMart's superior service and prices would cause the failure of nearby retailers. WalMart vigorously contests that projection. Even if true, that kind of impact is not within the Board's mandate nor is it a decision a state-wide agency should be making.
The Environmental Board was created to weight traditional environmental issues like wetlands or endangered species. By rejecting WalMart, the Board is seeking to transform itself into a super economic planning agency. Without any statutory authority, the Board wants the power to decide a new business is "negative" and bar it. NELF's brief will rebut the Board's right to impose its views on the local community. The people of St. Albans can use their zoning and planning powers to select the mix of large and small stores they want in the town. They have decided in favor of WalMart and the Board has no business second-guessing that decision.

 Court of Appeals Decides Preseault Case</b>
<br>
After almost two years of deliberation, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C. decided Paul Preseault's precedent-setting "takings" case. By a 2-1 vote, with a very strong dissent, the court held that Mr. Preseault was not entitled to compensation from the United States for the federal approval of a bike trail over an abandoned railroad line across his Vermont property.
The court relied on a 1920 law which, it held, put purchasers on notice that federal law might "someday" be changed to allow such conversions. Since trains continued to run over the Preseaults' land for 55 years after the 1920 act, the court seems to be, as the dissent put it, attempting to duck the constitutional issue. When this case was last in the U.S. Supreme Court, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor suggested Mr. Preseault was entitled to compensation. NELF is drafting a petition to return the case to the Court, the only forum where the appeals court's error can be corrected.

Tight Restrictions Sought on LSC-Funded Representation in Drug Evictions</b>
<br>
In one city after another, efforts by public housing managers to stop drug dealing and drug abuse in low-income housing projects have repeatedly been frustrated by federally-funded legal services attorneys, who have used the courts to prevent evictions of tenants engaged in drug activity. In response to a recent Legal Services Corporation proposal to restrict the ability of legal services attorneys to represent public housing tenants who are being evicted for drug activity, WLF argued that the LSC's proposal did not go nearly far enough. WLF pointed out that the proposal would prohibit such representations only in cases where (1) an actual criminal prosecution for drug activity has been initiated, (2) the particular drug activity forming the basis of the prosecution threatened the health or safety of public housing residents or workers, and (3) the leaseholder is the person being prosecuted, not another member of the leaseholder's household (such as a relative or boyfriend). WLF argued that these limitations should be removed from the proposed rule because they make the overall prohibition essentially toothless.

OSHA has created a powerful barrier to such initiatives by failing to recognize a privilege of confidentiality for employers' self-critical audits of workplace conditions. The petition also points out that OSHA has extensive record-keeping requirements and inspection powers with which to identify violations, without the need to deter self-evaluations.

<h2>October <i>Insider</i>: Hammering Out Welfare Reform in the Conference Committee</h2></center><p>
by Rick Dearborn, Director of Congressional Relations, U.S. Senate at The Heritage Foundation<br>
<hr>
<br>

Last week the U.S. Senate passed a welfare reform package that was solid on creating strong work requirements, but was weaker than the House of Representatives' version on the debate over curtailing the rampant illegitimacy rate. Both bills will now go to a conference, possibly lasting well into November, between both houses in order to iron out the differences.
Unless the Senate accedes to the House on its provisions denying additional monies to teenage welfare mothers who continue to have children, the bill that comes out of conference is likely to do little to discourage illegitimacy. On the flip side of the coin, it will be in the best interests of the U.S. taxpayer for the House to adopt the Senate's position on work requirements for able-bodied individuals on the public dole. <P>
The Senate provisions on work contain an important provision not currently found in the House bill, known as pay for performance.This provision states that welfare recipients may not receive their direct cash benefits until completing the work requirements. Under current law, if welfare recipients worked 80 percent of their required hours there would be no commensurate reduction in benefits. Special hearings to bring hours paid in line with hours worked nearly always favor the welfare recipients. The Senate bill does away with this problem by forcing welfare workers to do their work first and then be paid on the basis of how many hours they have completed. The House bill lacks the same commitment to stricter work requirements.<P>
Despite efforts by Senators Faircloth, Gramm, and Ashcroft, the Senate welfare reform package did not incorporate House reforms intended to ameliorate the problems of illegitimacy (many of which were first proposed by Heritage senior analyst Robert Rector). These three Senators fought hard for the inclusion of many of their bill's provisions. Among the amendments offered by the Faircloth/Gramm/Ashcroft team, expected to be issues in the conference committee, were policy proposals to cut off additional funds for teenage welfare mothers who continue to have children out-of-wedlock; provisions to deny only federal funds, not state funds, to minor mothers who are currently eligible to receive direct cash benefits in the mail or down at the social welfare center on the condition that they have children out-of-wedlock; a provision known as the illegitimacy ratio, that would provide an additional block grant to reward those states who curtail their ever-rising illegitimacy rate without increasing the rate of abortions within their state; and applying a four-day a-month work requirement to single, able-bodied males who currently receive food stamps and do not do any work.<P>
Although the illegitimacy ratio was adopted in the Senate bill, and a modified amendment regarding work requirements for food stamp recipients offered by Senator Jesse Helms was accepted, the denial of federal cash benefits to unwed teenagers, and the denial of federal cash benefits to welfare mothers who continue to have additional children (family cap) were not accepted by the U.S. Senate. <P>
The House conferees will be fighting to include their family cap provision. The Senate appointees appear unlikely to support the family cap but are likely to fight for stricter versions of workfare.<P>
 
Because of the many contentious items in both the House and Senate bills, the key to getting a strong reform proposal will be the appointment of conferees to the welfare Conference Committee. The House leadership plans to appoint members who are strong on both the work and illegitimacy issues. If Senator Dole places reform-minded individuals committed to solving America's welfare dilemma on the conference committee, he will help ensure that the end result will be a solid welfare reform package.

October <i>Insider</i> -- In Focus: Book Review<p>
</h2>
<i>By Corinne T. Coldwell</i><br>
<hr>

<b>Fatherless America</b>, by David Blankenhorn<br>
234 pp. BasicBooks, 1995
<P>
In <i>Fatherless America</i>, David Blankenhorn does not just list the repercussions of an ever-widening void of fathers in this country, he explains in frightening detail how society now regards fathers as superfluous. America  now has a society where the nuclear family is a rarity and divorce and single motherhood are commonplace. Now, children of fragmented families represent today's young generation. And unless this trend is reversed, nothing will repair the damage of fatherlessness. No amount of economic growth, welfare reform, prison construction, or school reform can cure the deeply rooted problems of male violence and lack of child well-being. Domestic policy reforms will fail when enacted upon a weak family structure. What can be done to restore and encourage strong two-parent families? Blankenhorn first discusses how the choices Americans made over the last few decades have denigrated traditional fatherhood. Then he elaborates on how these often selfish choices have not only affected society's perception of fatherhood, but have made them acceptable -- if not ideal. <P>

According to Blankenhorn, the fatherless crisis began during and after World War II when draft quotas could no longer be filled by only single men and married men without children. The Selective Service had to turn to fathers (approximately 6 million men) to fulfill their needs. During the war years,  fathers left home out of duty and loyalty to their country, and their memories were kept alive in a more positive light. Today's fathers, however, are largely absent from the home by choice. When fathers die due to illness or are killed at war their presence still looms over their children. The 1940s child could say: "My father had to leave for a while to do something important." The 1990s child must say: "My father left me permanently because he wanted to." This fatherless crisis did have  negative effects on the family, because many men came home feeling ill-prepared for fatherhood (in some cases the children were born while they were away) and many women had to find work in factories in order to survive. These circumstances sometimes led to tensions in the home, separation, or divorce. But this was only the first tier of problems that brought us to our situation today. The second fatherless crisis is more of "an unorganized dispersal of men for private purposes, regrettable but acceptable."<P>

Blankenhorn gives analysis of several types of fathers as viewed in academia and described by the media: the Deadbeat Dad, the Visiting Father, the Sperm Father, the Stepfather, and the Nearby Guy. Mr. Blankenhorn devotes the most insightful evaluation of the deadbeat dad in the wake of his notorious villain status in society that began in the late 1980s. Yet, as Blankenhorn points out, the deadbeat dad is really a caricature of the traditional male role. Even though he is absent, he is expected to be a provider. However, the new father (the cultural experts' ideal father) repudiates the traditional male role because he is more concerned about being a partner than worrying about monetary gain for his family. The descriptions of the new father and the deadbeat dad, as defined by the scholars and perpetuated in the media, obviously contradict one another. The distinct message coming from the "wanted: deadbeat dads" signs is that absent fathers can still be fathers as long as they write the checks. The deadbeat  dad is essentially the unnecessary father who refuses to pay. And "from the child's perspective, child-support payments, even if fully paid, do not replace a father's economic provision. More fundamentally, they do not replace a father." The necessity to hunt for deadbeat dads is tragic. What is even worse is the fact that we just want their money, not everything else that fatherhood provides for children. The money will allow for some things the children need and places they want to go, but only mothers and fathers can help shape children's character.<P>

 The danger in the status quo is making these lowered standards permanent. Mr. Blankenhorn illustrates that defeatist attempts to solve the problems of single motherhood lack an understanding of the root causes of fatherlessness in this country. The most important aspect of parenthood, "development of competence and character in children," needs to be understood first before any policy is initiated. One parent cannot do that alone: "If fatherhood has anything to say to men, it is that human completion is not a solo act."<P>

Blankenhorn offers a dozen initiatives to help inject the value of fatherhood back into communities. He suggests: the President should give an annual report on the state of fatherhood; communities should ask married fathers play a part in transforming public housing; Congress should pass a resolution stating that the first question of policymakers regarding all domestic legislation is whether it will strengthen or weaken the institution of marriage; well-known professional athletes could be drafted to promote the virtues of fatherhood; and prominent family scholars could write new textbooks for high school students about marriage and parenthood. Blankenhorn admits that his proposals are not answers, but attempts to ask a new question: "Does our society wish to recover the fatherhood idea?" If the answer is no, then proposals like his will go nowhere. But if the answer is yes, then his proposals will at the very least lead us  away from "a culture of fatherlessness" to a culture of fatherhood.<P>

<b>Dirty Tricks or Trump Card: US Covert Action and Counterintelligence</b><br>
 by Roy Godson<br>
National Strategy Information Center, Inc.<P>
Roy Godson, professor of government at Georgetown University, contends that covert operations are the missing element in the discussions about the future of US intelligence. Godson traces the history of US covert action and counterintelligence as well as its successes and failures. This volume suggests that the potential uses of covert action and counterintelligence amid new security challenges have rarely been discussed. Godson states that, although controversial, covert operations can be seen as simply one among many instruments of foreign policy_that they are neither "exceptional tools nor magic bullets." 342 pp. CONTACT: Kelley Beagher, Brassey's, 1313 Dolly Madison Blvd., Suite 401, McLean, VA 22101, 703/442-4535,  fax 703/442-9848.

<b>How to Close Down the Department of Commerce</b><br>
 by Joe Cobb<br>
Backgrounder No. 1049, The Heritage Foundation<P>

Joe Cobb, Heritage's John M. Olin senior fellow in economics, notes that the 1996 budget resolution's call for the elimination of the US Department of Commerce is both symbolic of the change in philosophy in Congress and a practical proposal to restructure a collection of programs and agencies that have little reason to share a common organizational structure. Cobb supports Congress's idea of closing the Department of Commerce, suggesting that the Department is "little more than a collection of disparate programs" which are beyond reinvention. This paper notes that the Commerce Department has 20 undersecretary and assistant secretary offices, six directors and administrators, 263 political appointees, and shares four budgetary functions with eight other Cabinet and sub-Cabinet departments. Cobb's recommendations include the following: a) close down the Office of the Secretary and Departmental Administration; b) consolidate the Bureau of the Census and other federal statistical agencies, including the Economics and Statistical Administration, within a single new independent agency; c) transfer trade functions to the Treasury Department, including the International Trade Administration; d) close the domestic offices of the US and Foreign Commercial Service; e) establish the Patent and Trademark Office as an independent corporation; and f) privatize the National Technical Information Service. Cobb supports allowing the Department, which would be the first in history to be dismantled, three years to terminate programs, reassign civil service personnel, and dispose of surplus property. 23 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.<P>

<b>How to Privatize Orange County's Airports</b> by Robert W. Poole, Jr.<br>
Policy Study No. 194, Reason Foundation<p>

Robert Poole, president of the Reason Foundation, cites two major problems with Orange County's decision to sell John Wayne Airport: 1) the potential of serious competition from a future airport at El Toro, which might prematurely draw traffic away from John Wayne; and 2) the likelihood of litigation by the airlines who contend that a municipality may not legally make use of the proceeds from the sale of an existing federally aided airport. This study identifies several different types of airport privatization, including contract management, lease, and sale, and outlines the legal status of each with respect to federal grants and constraints. Poole recommends two types of privatization, in a coordinated fashion, to solve Orange County's dilemma_the county should seek a single firm that will enter into two separate agreements: 1) a long-term contract to manage John Wayne airport and 2) a purchase or lease agreement under which the firm will develop a commercial airport at El Toro. The author notes that development of the latter will be closely coordinated with future activities at the former, to ensure the continued financial viability of John Wayne Airport through the years needed to retire its outstanding bonds. 15 pp. CONTACT: Reason Foundation, 3415 S.

<b>Designing a Comprehensive State-Level Privatization Program: How-To Guide #1</b><br>
 by William D. Eggers<br>
Washington Institute for Policy Studies<P>

William Eggers, director of the Reason Foundation's privatization center, presents this guide as the first in a series of seven  on the topic of state government privatization. Eggers recommends that states develop comprehensive, forward-looking privatization programs rather than adopting piecemeal approaches. This paper offers nine basic steps for designing a systematic, comprehensive program: 1) develop the institutional structure for privatization; 2) set up a program of adjustments and incentives for public employees; 3) identify privatization techniques; 4) identify state services and assets that offer opportunities for privatization; 5) determine the legislative and executive barriers to privatization and revise or rescind these; 6) consider introducing mandatory competitive incentives into the delivery of certain state and local services; 7) evaluate the feasibility of privatizing identified privatization opportunities; 8) determine the potential cost savings from privatizing services and assets selected for privatization; and 9) prepare a plan for implementation. 28 pp. CONTACT: Washington Institute for Policy Studies, 999 Third Ave., Suite 1060, Seattle, WA 98104, 206/467-9561.<P>


<b>A National ID System: Big Brother's Solution to Illegal Immigration</b><br>
 by John J. Miller and Stephen Moore<br>
Policy Analysis No. 237, Cato Institute<p>

John Miller, vice president of the Center for Equal Opportunity, and Stephen Moore, director of fiscal policy studies at the Cato Institute, describe the efforts by some legislators in the House and Senate to create a national computer registration system for all American workers as "Orwellian." Miller and Moore write, "The computer registry and national ID card, which would confer on the federal government vast new police-state powers, is highly incompatible with the Republican theme of expanding freedom and reducing government." This paper cites three major problems with the current proposals: 1) the identification system could be easily expanded to include other purposes beyond deterring illegal immigration, such as implementation of Clinton-style health security card, conducting background checks on individuals, and enforcing affirmative action laws and other government regulations; 2) the system would cost the federal government between $3 billion and $6 billion per year to administer; and 3) error rates that are commonplace for government databases would lead to hundreds of thousands of Americans being denied legal access to the workforce. The authors conclude that a computer registry would impose large costs on American citizens in terms of both dollars and lost liberties. 23 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20001, 202/842-0200.<P>

<b>How to Solve Mandatory Auto Insurance</B><br>
 by John Semmens<br>
Issue Analysis Report No. 5, Goldwater Institute<P>

John Semmens, winner of the Goldwater Institute's Reinventing Government competition in 1994, proposes privatizing automobile registration and driver's licenses. In this plan, private insurance companies license drivers and register automobiles, allowing drivers to deal with a single, private agency. Semmens also proposes requiring full insurance for drivers that insurance companies choose to cover, stating that private registration, along with full coverage of drivers, is likely to do a better job of taking irresponsible drivers off the road and make those who cause accidents fully liable for the dollar damage they cause. The author criticizes the current system for allowing underinsured and uninsured motorists to escape liability for much of the damage they cause to others and their property. Semmens contends that uninsured motorists will be easy to identify since they will have no privately issued license tag. 10 pp. CONTACT: Goldwater Institute, Bank One Center-Concourse, 201 N.

<b>Taxpayer Choice: A Common Sense Solution to the Crisis of the Welfare State</b><br>
 by John C. Goodman<br>
Issue Analysis Report No. 4, Goldwater Institute<p>

John Goodman, the 1995 John M. Olin winter fellow at the Goldwater Institute, offers evidence that the only way to reform welfare is to end the federal government's monopoly on welfare tax dollars. In order to combat the perverse incentives inherent to the current welfare programs, Goodman recommends allowing individual taxpayers to give up to 40 percent of their personal income taxes (the amount currently spent on federal welfare programs) to any qualified charity, public or private. According to the author's plan, the government would then be required to subtract a dollar from public welfare programs for every dollar given. 51 pp. CONTACT: Goldwater Institute, Bank One Center-Concourse, 201 N.

<B>Combatting Illegitimacy and Counseling Teen Abstinence: A Key Component of Welfare Reform</B><BR>
 by Joseph J. Piccione and Robert A. Scholle<BR>
Backgrounder No. 1051, The Heritage Foundation<p>

Joseph Piccione and Robert Scholle, both former policy analysts in the Office of Population Affairs in the US Department of Health and Human Services during the Bush administration, address the role of soaring illegitimacy rates in America's social fabric. The authors recommend abandoning the pragmatic "contraceptive approach" to adolescent pregnancy. Instead the authors support the "abstinence approach," which incorporates the basic cultural and psychological realities of the transition to adulthood. Piccione and Scholle support a three-pronged approach for young people to avoiding poverty and dependency: complete high-school; get a job, even a low paying one; and have children only within marriage. The authors recommend funding education for such a program with $200 million in block grants to the states through the Maternal and Child Health Services. 21 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.<P>

<b>What Welfare Should Be</b><br>
 by Larry P. Arnn and Thomas G. West<br>
California Journal July 1995, The Claremont Institute<p>

Larry Arnn, president of The Claremont Institute, and Thomas West, a senior fellow at The Claremont Institute, posits the question, "What should be the welfare system of California 25 years from now?" The article answers the question with ideas that support family and work, respect for education and marriage, disdain for illegitimacy and compassion for the deserving poor. The authors write, "It [California's welfare system] must rely in large part upon the initiative of private parties and organizations; in other words it must be again a system of charity and not of interest-group driven public policy. In short, it must be everything the current system is not." 4 pp. CONTACT: The Claremont Institute, 250 West First Street, Suite 330, Claremont, CA 91711, 909/621-6825.<P>

<b>Reforming Medicaid</b><BR>
 by James R. Cantwell<br>
Policy Report No. 197, National Center for Policy Analysis<P>
James Cantwell of the Congressional Budget Office argues that any attempt to balance the budget will be futile without reforming Medicaid. Cantwell presents six steps to achieve Medicaid savings of $185.4 billion over seven years without any reduction in benefits for needy people: 1) changing incentives for recipients through Medical Savings Accounts and/or managed care would produce a $37.2 billion savings in acute care programs and $64 billion in long term care; 2) enforcing estate recovery provisions would produce savings of $35 billion; 3) redirecting and capping disproportionate share hospital payments would produce savings of $13.9 billion; 4) reducing administrative costs would produce a savings of $3.7 billion; 5) making Medicaid the payer of last resort would produce savings of $31.5 billion; and 6) reducing waste, fraud, and abuse through greater state vigilance would produce savings of an unknown but substantial amount. This paper presents statistical evidence and analysis for each of the points, concluding that the savings for seven years would total at least $185.4 billion. 14 pp. CONTACT: National Center for Policy Analysis, 12655 N.

<b>FDA Censorship Can Be Hazardous to Your Health</b><br>
 by David R. Henderson<br>
Policy Brief No. 158, Center for the Study of American Business<p>

David Henderson, adjunct fellow at the Center for the Study of American Business, argues that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is censoring valuable information about drugs that could help doctors treat their patients more effectively. Henderson reports that the FDA routinely challenges drug companies that distribute articles from medical journals reporting positive, but not necessarily FDA-approved, uses of their drugs. According to the author, no matter how close the recommended off-label use is to an approved use, the FDA's Division of Drug Marketing will stop a drug company from sending out medical journal articles that recommend, or even mention such an application. Henderson notes that 40 to 50 percent of all drugs are prescribed for off-label uses. This paper suggest that this new, expanded role of the FDA is the result of bureaucratic ingenuity, not congressional action, which could result in the loss of life. Henderson endorses eliminating the role of the FDA as a censor for advertising, returning this function to the Federal Trade Commission, which was responsible for this regulation before 1962. 17 pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington University, Campus Box 1208, St. Louis, MO 63130-4899, 314/935-5630.<P>

<b>Outcome-Based Education: Miracle Cure or Plague?</b><br>
 by Brunno V. Manno<br>
Mackinac Center Report, Mackinac Center for Public Policy and Hudson Institute<P>
Brunno Manno, a senior fellow in Hudson's education policy studies program, attempts to explain why enormous conflicts over outcome-based education exist, suggesting that the original intent of outcome-based education was productive. Manno maintains that when states began efforts to institute these programs, they turned over the crucial task of defining outcomes over to the very education establishment figures threatened by the process. Having adopted in principle the focus on results (originally intended to be academic results), the educators presented lists of outcomes that emphasized values, attitudes and behavior, and often reflect quasi-political or ideologically correct positions. Dr. Manno shows how this process occurred in various states, then proposes a twofold policy strategy that provides a way out of the dilemma: establish high, uniform academic standards and a system of accountability with real consequences for success and failure; and create greater diversity in the kinds of schools we finance, how we pay for them, and the ways educators provide solid academic achievement, with parents free to choose the schools that best meet their needs. 24 pp. CONTACT: Mackinac Center for Public Policy, 119 Ashman St., P.O.

<b>Teacher, Inc.: A Private-Practice Option for Educators</b><br>
 by Janet R. Beales<br>
Mackinac Center Report, Mackinac Center for Public Policy and Reason Foundation<P>
Janet Beales, policy analyst with the education studies program of the Reason Foundation, discusses private-practice teacher contracts as an option to schools and communities looking for new ways to provide education. Beales describes private-practice teachers as professional educators who provide their services to schools or other entities, on a contract basis, helping school officials strengthen accountability, cut costs, and increase flexibility. In turn, according to the author, the contract arrangement elevates the professional status of teachers, allowing teachers to take control of their own careers, negotiate their own compensation, and make their own decisions about how to use time, resources and methodologies. This study profiles the experiences of a number of private-practice educators and discusses the benefits that schools may realize by contracting for instruction. In addition, this study presents results from two national surveys about the legal authority of school boards to contract for instruction and also provides a chart to help administrators identify the fully allocated costs of in-house and contract service. 23 pp. CONTACT: Mackinac Center for Public Policy, 119 Ashman St., P.O.

<b>Where the Connoisseurs Send Their Children to School</b><br>
 by Denis P. Doyle<br>
Hudson Briefing Paper No. 181, Hudson Institute<P>

Denis Doyle, president of his own education research organization, an analyst at The Heritage Foundation and formerly associated with the Hudson Institute, asserts that public school teachers and administrators are in a unique position to assess the quality of public education for their own children. Doyle writes, "The data is clear: in the largest urban areas, public school teachers are more likely than the population at large to enroll their children in private schools. By and large it is the poor and dispossessed, particularly in large, troubled urban areas, who are forced into the nation's public schools. But these schools are so unattractive that the teachers pay significant sums of money to send their children elsewhere. 12 pp. CONTACT: Hudson Institute, Herman Kahn Center, P.O.

<b>The Freedom to Farm Act (H.R. 2195): Key Changes Will Improve Potential for Serious Agriculture Reform</b><br>
by John Frydenlund<br>
Issue Bulletin No. 211, The Heritage Foundation
<P>
John Frydenlund, director of Heritage's Agriculture Policy Project, praises the Freedom to Farm Act as a good first step toward reforming agricultural policy. Frydenlund points out that the bill accomplishes several significant goals: replacing traditional payments for commodity programs with transition payments that decline over a period of seven years; eliminating supply controls; and extricating the federal bureaucracy from the decision-making process of planting requirements. Frydenlund, however, makes several recommendations to strengthen the Act and to dramatically reform the current system:1) specify an exact date when programs will end, preferably no later that the year 2001, by deauthorizing current law; 2) prevent transition payments from becoming an unjustified windfall by specifying a trigger or price level for each commodity that would reduce or eliminate transition payments for a given year; and 3) eliminate the Conservation Reserve Program or at least drastically reduce the number of acres in the program. He suggests two methods for assuring that reforms embodied in the Freedom to Farm Act and other proposals are not circumvented: cap annual Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) spending at levels provided in the budget resolution and reduce CCC borrowing authority from $30 billion to $15 billion. Frydenlund forecasts that these changes will greatly improve and provide long-term reform for the agricultural system in America. 5 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

<b>A Contract with Rural America</b><br>
by Dennis T. Avery and Dave Juday<br>
Hudson Briefing Paper No. 182, Hudson Institute
<P>
Dennis Avery, director of Hudson's Center for Global Food Issues, and Dave Juday, an agricultural businessman, observe that increasing budget restraints no longer allow Washington to hand prosperity to America's farmers by way of farm subsidies. The authors write, "Changes in US agricultural tax, trade, and regulatory policies could enhance the nation's rural prosperity quickly, not only for farmers but for off-farm rural residents who have too often been driven from their communities by cropland setasides." In order to correct the problems created by current agricultural policies, the authors  suggest that Congress broaden the focus of farm policy by passing an eleven point Contract with Rural America. The eleven points would focus on regulatory and tax relief and expanded trade opportunities. 8 pp. CONTACT: Hudson Institute, Herman Kahn Center, P.O.

Donald Leal, senior associate at PERC, suggests that the Forest Service could save money by following policies similar to those those that govern the operation of county and state forests. Leal presents the findings from his studies of the economic and environmental performance of county and state foresters in Minnesota and Montana compared with that of Forest Service lands in the same region. Leal made comparisons between Superior National Forest and the St. Louis County forestlands and found that the county made more than $2 million from timber sales while Superior lost over $5 million on timber sales.

<b>Cleaning Up Superfund: The Case for State Environmental Leadership</b><br>
by J. Winston Porter<br>
Policy Study No. 195, Reason Foundation
<P>

Winston Porter, president of the Waste Policy Center, describes the Superfund program as one of the nation's most visible site remediation programs. Since the inception of Superfund in 1980, the program has received many criticisms, especially given that only 150 of the 1,300 designated sites have been cleaned in 15 years. According to the author, an undeservedly large portion of the funds have been used for legal proceedings. Porter examines an alternative approach to Superfund; the author recommends allowing the states to deal with the sites_at a fraction of the time and costs. Currently states are spending about $700 million annually working on about 11,000 sites, while the EPA spends approximately $1 billion annually dealing with about 1,000 sites. In this study, the author briefly reviews Superfund and the similar programs of the states; presents how-to steps to turn much of Superfund over to willing and able states; and recommends methods of state certification, funding provisions, EPA's continued role, and modification of the Superfund statute. 14 pp. CONTACT: Reason Foundation, 3415 S.

<b>Superfund Unplugged</b><br>
by Wayne T. Brough<br>
Issues and Answers, Citizens for a Sound Economy
<P>
Wayne T. Brough, director of research for Citizens for a Sound Economy, contends that the Superfund program_created in the wake of public concerns over toxic wastes at Love Canal_imposes billions of dollars in costs on consumers and local communities while providing few benefits in return. Brough suggests that the program's liability rules delay the clean-up process and impose inequitable costs on businesses and communities. Brough states, "The Superfund program requires fundamental reforms that implement sound risk management practices and a more cost-effective allocation of resources. At the same time, liability rules should be changed to eliminate perverse incentives that divert resources from environmental cleanups." This paper outlines the basics of Superfund reform as follows: allow states to play a greater role; privatize as many sites as possible; repeal retroactive liability; reform joint and several liability; institute no new taxes for Superfund; utilize risk based management and sound science; and create new mechanisms of public finance. 19 pp. CONTACT: Citizens for a Sound Economy, 1250 H St., NW, Suite 700, Washington, DC 20005-3908, 202/783-3870.

<b>Progressive Environmentalism: Principles for Regulatory Reform</b><br>
by Kent Jeffreys<br>
Policy Report No. 194, National Center for Policy Analysis
<P>

Kent Jeffreys, senior fellow at the National Center for Policy Analysis, argues that the solution for current environmental problems requires the government to act in accordance with certain pre-defined rules before enacting environmental legislation or approving any environmental regulations. The author suggests the following guidelines: 1) The Federalism Rule, which would require that all regulatory decisions be made by the smallest possible government entity; 2) The Cost-Benefit Rule, which requires that objective studies weigh the benefits against the costs of new regulations; and 3) The Compensation Rule, which requires the government to compensate innocent property owners for the loss of property rights or non-negligible losses of value. This study examines abuses of the three rules cited above in specific federal environmental programs and explores solutions that would bring the programs into compliance with the rules. 44 pp. CONTACT: National Center for Policy Analysis, 12655 N.

<b>Making Government Work: How Congress Can Really Reinvent Government</b><br> by Donald J. Devine<br>
Backgrounder No. 1050, The Heritage Foundation<P>

Donald Devine, former director of the US Office of Personnel Management and adjunct scholar at Heritage, recommends that the federal government should "return to the pre-Carter system of decentralized authority." Devine describes several problems with the administration's current proposals to reinvent government, writing that the plan: will weaken policies on hiring, promoting, and rewarding federal employees based on individual merit and performance; will eliminate presidential standards for job performance; will enhance federal agency and union control over setting salary levels; will weaken long-standing "veterans preference" standards; and will create a new role for federal unions that would undermine management authority for defining and assigning work. Devine makes specific recommendations for defining government's proper functions: devolve power to the states; define agency missions; privatize government functions; protect the merit system; establish responsibility; clarify rules; re-establish merit selection; make the hiring process rational; re-establish pay for performance; rationalize federal benefits; end duplication stop Clinton's devaluation of management responsibility; and consolidate the management of federal resources. 18 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.<P>

<b>Campaign Finance Regulation: Faulty Assumptions and Undemocratic Consequences</B><br> by Bradley A. Smith<br>
Policy Analysis No. 238, Cato Institute<P>

Bradley Smith, assistant professor at Capital University Law School in Ohio, acknowledges that while efforts to limit political contributions and spending are extremely popular, no evidence exists that campaign finance regulation has achieved or will achieve its goals of reducing the influence of money, opening up the political system, and lowering the costs of campaigns. The author maintains that efforts to limit contributions and spending have been based on two faulty assumptions: that candidates spend too much per vote (total spending for candidates for all offices is less than $10 per eligible voter every two years) and that large donations are undemocratic (most challenges to the status quo and most working-class political movements have been financed by wealthy donors). Smith argues that, "Our current campaign finance regulations favor incumbents, stifle grassroots activity, distort and constrict political debate, and infringe on traditional First Amendment freedoms. There is little reason to believe that still more regulation and public funding will yield positive results." 26 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20001, 202/842-0200.<P>

<B>Microcosm of the Movement: Local Term Limits in the United States</b><BR> by Danielle Fagre<br>

Danielle Fagre, research director of the US Term Limits Foundation, questions why municipal term limits are the least documented, yet most prevalent component of the term limit movement. The author uses municipal term limits, which date back to 1851, as an example of the longevity of the term limit movement, despite opponents claims that the movement is a fad. This paper examines the municipal term limits in New York City, Los Angeles, Houston, Dallas, San Francisco, Kansas City, New Orleans, Denver, Cincinnati and suggests that these local limits are a microcosm of the national term limit movement. 16 pp. CONTACT: U.S. Term Limit Foundation, 1511 K St., NW, Suite 540, Washington, DC 20005, 800/733-6440, fax 202/393-6434.

<B>Only A Piece of Paper?: The Social Significance of the Marriage License and The Consequences of Cohabitation, Divorce and Stepfamilies</b><br> by Glenn T. Stanton<br>
Focus on the Family<P>

Glenn Stanton, a social research analyst for the public policy division of Focus on the Family, presents a compilation of statistical data, gathered since the 12th century, which reveals that marriage matters in the lives of children, adults, and societies. The results consistently show that marriage improves the physical and mental health as well as the  longevity of men and women. On the whole, this data shows that married people do better in every measure of specific and general well-being than their unmarried counterparts. The research reveals information about the benefits of marriage, the disadvantages of cohabitation, and the effects of remarriage and stepfamilies. Stanton concludes that, based on the statistical evidence, it is critical to rediscover a cultural norm for family life in America and hold it up as an ideal. Stanton writes, "The ideal should be the traditional two-parent family where mother and father strive for a healthy marriage and both participate in the daily care and nurturing of their biological or adopted children." 36 pp. CONTACT: Focus on the Family, 8605 Explorer Dr., Colorado Springs, CO 80920, 719/531-3400.<p>

<b>Multiculturalism and Economic Growth</b><br> by Gerald W. Scully<br>
Policy Report No. 196, National Center for Policy Analysis<P>

Gerald Scully, senior fellow of the National Center for Policy Analysis, contradicts conventional wisdom by acknowledging that the work of most anthropologists identifies cultural diversity as a universal source of social conflict and often as a barrier to economic progress as well as personal freedom. Scully finds that cultural relativism has made the study of the role of culture in human progress controversial, but he points out that intergroup enmity is widespread in culturally heterogeneous societies. This study shows that cultural diversity and a lack of economic freedom go hand in hand. Scully writes, "For all its problems, the West has managed cultural conflict better than the rest of the world because it has free economic, civil and political institutions...despite this success, we are moving away from the notion of individual freedom to that of group rights in the United States." Based on his study of cultural conflict and economic progress, Scully recommends that the Third World move towards freer economic institutions and a reduction of cultural heterogeneity to transform its economic progress. 19 pp., CONTACT: National Center for Policy Analysis, 12655 N.

The September issue of National Minority Politics offers its readers a series of articles by Gwen Richardson, Stanley Crouch, and Gary Bauer on how Hollywood portrays blacks, families, and Christians. Richardson cites the bias with which Hollywood portrays blacks, usually as crooks, pimps, informers, or persons needing assistance from the government. Furthermore, an examination of attempts to discredit the family finds that Hollywood usually puts a positive spin on homosexuality, premarital sex, illegitimacy, parental disrespect, and anti-Christian bigotry. Stanley Crouch examines the historical evolution of black images in films and television, from the early 1900s to the present.

<h3>Defenders of Property Rights</h3>

<B>Defenders Moves Forward with an Aggressive Litigation Program</B><P>

Defenders has been engaged by the United Property Owners of Washington (UPOW) to serve as co-counsel in the case of United States v. Washington. At issue is an 1850s treaty between the then-territorial governor and sixteen Indian tribes regarding the harvesting of shellfish. Even though most of the tideland area of Washington is privately owned (it is one of only a few states with such private ownership) and has been tended and enhanced over the years by its owners, the tribes and the federal government believe that certain Indian tribes share the right to harvest the shellfish. In an interim order, a federal district judge awarded the tribes the ability to take half the harvest. The tribes and the government, however, are seeking a larger take of the shellfish and full access to the tidelands. UPOW has intervened in the hope of protecting their right of "exclusive possession and clear title" to their property.<P>

<b>Defenders Fights Charge of Hunter Harassment</B><P>

Defenders has also filed a complaint in a state court in Minnesota seeking just compensation on behalf of a property owner. In James F. Peternell v. State of Minnesota, the private property owner was criminally prosecuted for attempting to exclude state officials from his property. Mr. Peternell bought 160 acres of land in 1972, 140 of which are considered wetland. A 1984 state law designated the wetland area as a "protected water basin," making it "public waters." Although he had previously been told by the Department of Natural Resources that his land was still privately-owned, he was later indicted on charges of "hunter harassment" when he tried to remove uninvited hunters--including an undercover DNR official--from his land. While the criminal charges against Mr. Peternell were dismissed by a jury, a court did find that his land can now be considered public domain under the 1984 law.<P>

<B>Defenders Supports Rights of Hog Farmer</B><P>

In City of Chesapeake v. Earl Warren, Defenders represents a hog farmer in Virginia. The city officials have now decided that his hog farm constitutes a "public nuisance", even though his land has been used for over 120 years and he follows sound industry practices on his farm. At stake in this case is the extent to which local governments can characterize historically typical and productive uses of land as a "nuisance" (as the city has in this case by passage of an ordinance directed at his activities) and thereby destroy that use of land without incurring the constitutional duty to pay the owner just compensation for that taking. On September 8, 1995, the court rejected the government's request for a permanent injunction that would have shut down the hog farm and instead offered to work with the property owner in an attempt to remedy the situation short of closing down the farm. Another hearing has been set for December 7, 1995.<P>

<B>Defenders Challenges Gas Company</B><P>

In Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation v. Deana Wingfield Drain, Defenders is challenging in federal court the utility company's practice of unilaterally expanding its right-of-way from 8 inches to 50 feet without compensating property owners for that taking. In this case, Columbia Gas forced the property owners to move their mobile home and shed (both of which were anchored to cement foundations) out of the newly-claimed right-of-way, at their own expense. Moreover, the enforcement of the right-of-way has been selective; in fact, one home actually sits atop the gas line but those home owners have not been asked to move the house. Discovery is underway in the case.
On September 20, 1995, Defenders will be filing a petition for a writ of certiorari in the United States Supreme Court, asking the court to review the decision of the Oregon Supreme Court. At issue in the case, United Employer Benefit Corporation v. Department of Insurance and Finance (Oregon), is whether personal property is protected to the same degree as is land against uncompensated takings and also whether threats which have the effect of destroying an ongoing business trigger the duty of government to pay for the taking.
Defenders will also file a brief on behalf of itself and other co-amici curiae in the case of Stubblefield v. City of Sand Bernardino on September 20, 1995, in the United States Supreme Court. At issue in this case is whether government actions which were clearly arbitrary and designed to target a small developers project violate the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment.

<h3>Institute for Justice</H3>

<B>Runstrom, et al. V. City of Kalamazoo</B><P>

On September 7, 1995, the Institute filed a constitutional challenge to the City of Kalamazoo's housing inspection law that allows government inspectors to enter apartments without tenant consent or a validly-executed search warrant. The Institute for Justice filed the lawsuit on behalf of 13 Kalamazoo apartment tenants. The case came to the attention of the Institute for Justice when landlord Jerry Speedy was brought up on criminal charges for refusing to provide access to rented apartments unless the tenants consented to the building code inspections.
The constitutional rule that the Institute for Justice seeks to establish in this lawsuit is: If government inspectors wish to enter tenants' homes, they must ask for and receive their explicit consent. If the tenants do not wish to grant inspectors access to their homes, the government must obtain a search warrant based on some reasonable suspicion (probable cause) that the housing code is being violated.<P>

<B>Teen Challenge of San Antonio Wins Battle Against Texas Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse (TCADA)</B><P>

The Institute represents Teen Challenge of San Antonio, in its effort to continue its faith-based drug and alcohol treatment program, which was threatened with the secular requirements imposed by the Texas Commission on Alcohol and Drug Abuse licensing requirements.
Teen Challenge, a thirty-five year old program with an excellent track record of success, believes the key to solving chemical dependency problems lies in the spiritual dimension of a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. It accepts no government funding for treatment and all participants come to this program voluntarily.
TCADA views addiction as a disease of the body that can be treated, but never cured. TCADA's secularized, disease-based model for addiction and treatment--and the regulations that implement this model--did not allow Teen Challenge to carry out its salvation, Christ-centered model of treatment. Based on this incompatibility, Teen Challenge objected to being forced to meet the licensing and regulatory requirements of TCADA. The Institute for Justice, working with the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, is providing legal representation to Teen Challenge in ongoing negotiations with Texas and is prepared for litigation if necessary.<P>

<B>Battle for Expanded Choice Continues in Milwaukee</B><P>

Despite substantial disruption as a result of the Wisconsin Supreme Court's injunction of the recently expanded school choice program, most students have received privately funded scholarships through Parents Acquiring Values in Education (PAVE) to allow them to enroll in their chosen private schools. This resulted from the generous contributions made by caring individuals, parents, schools, and the business and philanthropic communities.
Over the next month, the lawyers in this case will meet to determine whether there are factual issues in dispute. Assuming the Wisconsin Supreme Court does not remand the case to the trial court, the Court could (a) rule in favor of the IJ on all issues, (b) rule against the IJ, but decide that the religion clauses of the Wisconsin Constitution are the same as the First Amendment, (c) rule against the IJ, finding that the Wisconsin Constitution is more restrictive than the First Amendment, (d) rule against the IJ on the other grounds under the Wisconsin Constitution. Under the first two scenarios, an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court would be possible, but an appeal would be precluded under the third and fourth scenarios. The Institute was granted intervenor status on behalf of Parents for School Choice and eight individual families, and will continue to play an active role throughout the litigation.

<B>Boston Taxi Medallion Fight Returns to State Court</B><P>

Nine years after beginning a seemingly quixotic struggle to drive his own taxi in Boston and four years after his precedent-setting victory in Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, Robert Lynch, represented by NELF, has returned to the Massachusetts courts in order to try to reap the fruits of his struggle.
Robert Lynch is a partially disable man who has supported himself for years by driving taxi cabs in Boston. Ten years ago, he tried to acquire a taxi "medallion", the legal right to operate his own cab, rather than just drive cabs owned by others. Since World War II, the number of Boston medallions had been fixed at 1525 and their price had risen over $50,000, far in excess of his resources. The resulting shortage of taxis led to higher fares and reduced taxi availability, particularly in minority and low income areas which are more dependent upon taxi service than other parts of the city.
Mr. Lynch went to the public library and found a 1934 law, never before use, which gave a state agency the power to require Boston to issue new medallions and he appealed to the agency. In 1990, it ordered Boston to issue hundreds of new medallions "immediately." The order was appealed by taxi owners to Massachusetts' Supreme Judicial Court, but Mr. Lynch, represented by NELF, prevailed in 1991.
Since then, NELF and Mr. Lynch have negotiated with Boston in an effort establish reasonable ground rules for issuance of the 300 new medallions called for by the agency's order on remand. Gradually, Boston hardened its position and finally decided that it could legally ignore the state agency order.
NELF has now filed a mandamus action on Mr. Lynch's behalf. While Mr. Lynch concedes that Boston has the right to establish reasonable rules as to who shall be permitted to operate taxis in the city, it cannot simply flout its legal obligation to issue new medallions. Issuing the new medallions is not only required to comply with the city's legal duty but also it will begin the opening of a rigid and inefficient system to competition and free enterprise, which will benefit the taxi-using public.<P>

<b>NELF Supports High-Tech Manufacturer</b><P>

The basic issue in the case is whether a state should use its tax law to encourage or discourage a business' effort to move away from traditional labor intensive "manufacturing" in the direction of more modern high-technology, knowledge-intensive operations.
For over thirty years, Massachusetts has classified Houghton-Mifflin Corporation, a nationally-known book publisher, as a "manufacturing corporation," which entitles it to a tax credit for new equipment purchases and other tax benefits. In 1991, the state Department of Revenue notified Houghton-Mifflin that this classification had been revoked, retroactive to 1986. The basis for that action was that Houghton-Mifflin no longer printed its textbooks in the state, having shifted that aspect of its business to independent contractors while retaining in Massachusetts its more intellectual activities including writing, editing, preparing art work, designing and preparing computer materials and compact discs.
Houghton-Mifflin appealed the Department's action. The state Appellate Tax Board ruled in Houghton-Mifflin's favor, holding that its operations in Massachusetts continued to meet the state's statutory tests for constituting "manufacturing" as well as the Department's own regulations on that subject. The Department appealed to Massachusetts' highest court, arguing that, as a matter of law, Houghton-Mifflin's operations could not constitute manufacturing.
NELF's amicus brief argued that the Board had been correct. When the legislature originally amended the state's tax laws to encourage "manufacturing", it had n o intention of binding business into a straightjacket irrevocably tied to then-current technology. Rather, its obvious goal was to use the tax laws creatively to encourage businesses to take actions that would benefit the wider community. In today's economy, Houghton-Mifflin's actions in shifting its operations in the direction of cleaner, high wage, high technology jobs are precisely the sort of positive transformation that Massachusetts should be encouraging.

<h3>Pacific Legal Foundation</h3>

<B>Bureaucratic Land Grab Averted</b><P>

State of California ex rel. State Lands Commission v. Superior Court (Lovelace). In a key victory for property rights, the California Supreme Court agreed with Pacific Legal Foundation arguments and thwarted a major land grab by the State Lands Commission. As a result, the private ownership, use, and enjoyment of properties along the banks of rivers, streams, or lake shores in the state have been preserved.
In California, as in all other states, new land that is formed by slow accretion to a shoreline or riverbank becomes the private property of the adjacent upland owner. Accretion is the gradual and imperceptible accumulation of land by natural causes. This process can occur either by the washing up of sand or soil from a body of water, such as the sea or a river, or by the gradual subsidence of water which leaves land uncovered. Thus, if a river gradually shifts its course by the accumulations of silt, sand, grave, and other sediment, and land is created where there was once only river bottom, the owner of the adjacent upland gains title to the newly formed land.
During the mid to late 1800s, hydraulic mining both enriched the economy of the state and wreaked havoc on the downstream reaches of the San Joaquin and Sacramento River watershed by depositing vast amounts of gravel, sand, and silt into the waterways. As this material worked its way downstream, it was deposited in the slower reaches of these waterways causing the river bottoms to gradually rise by many feet, creating dry land where there once was river bottom.
Richard Lovelace owns property which includes a 12-acre parcel that was created by accretion when the river bottom rose between 12 and 15 feet during the heyday of California's hydraulic gold mining era. The State Lands Commission tried to snatch that property from Mr. Lovelace on the theory that the accretion was the result of "artificial" rather than natural causes.
The California Supreme Court agreed with PLF's arguments and held that title to land formed in the last century as a partial result of the sediment washed downstream by hydraulic mining would be determined according to the rule of accretion. That is, if it was deposited slowly and imperceptibly over time, title would inure to the adjacent upland riparian owner onto whose land the accretion occurs. Had the state bureaucracy gotten its way, the settled status of thousand of acres in California would have been destroyed.<P>

<b>Defending Voters' Right to Cut Back Government Spending</b><P>

Atiyeh v. Oregon. In this case, PLF is defending Ballot Measure 8, enacted by Oregon voters to roll back lavish pension plans for state workers.
Oregon law has long required that public employees contribute 6% of their gross pay toward their retirement pension plan. However, in 1979, the state Legislature enacted a Pension Pick-Up Law requiring the government employer (i.e., the taxpayers) to "pick up" the 6% tab. Thus, since 1979 most Oregon government workers have not actually contributed to their annual pension premiums, although "on paper" they have been credited with making a 6% contribution! Under the Pension Pick-Up Law, Oregon taxpayers not only bear the full pension cost for public employees, but also guarantee a minimum 8% return on pension investments. In addition, pension benefits can be increased by unused sick leave.
Recognizing that this generous pension plan was not akin to most private sector pension plans, Oregon voters enacted Ballot Measure 8. A major objective of this initiative is to reverse the 1979 Pick-Up Law by amending the Oregon Constitution to require public employees to contribute 6% of their salary toward their pension plan. To ensure that taxpayers no longer pick up the 6% tab, Measure 8 prohibits government employers from contracting to relieve public employees of their contribution duty or to increase their salaries or benefits as an offset. Among other restrictions, Measure 8 also bars government contracts from guaranteeing the interest rate on public pensions funds.
The Pacific Legal Foundation filed a friend of the court brief in the Oregon Supreme Court opposing a lawsuit seeking to block Ballot Measure 8. The suit does not challenge the substance of the measure, but the legality of the whole initiative process as applied to Measure 8.

<h3>Washington Legal Foundation</h3>

<B>Michigan Supported in Motor Voter Litigation</B><P>

Joined by three Members of the Michigan delegation to Congress (Representatives Richard R. Chrysler, Nick Smith, and Fred Upton), the Washington Legal Foundation filed an amici curiae brief in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan in support of Michigan's position in ACORN v. Miller, a suit brought to force the state to carry out the unfunded mandates in the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (the "motor voter" law). WLF argued that the Act is not within the power of Congress to determine the "Times, Places and Manner of holding elections for Senators and Representatives." Among other mandates, the Act requires a state to offer assistance in completing a voter registration form to all clientele visiting welfare and unemployment agencies. <P>

<b>Supreme Court Urged To Limit Abusive Class Action Suits</B><P>

In a brief filed in the Supreme Court in Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. Epstein, WLF argued that a corporation should not have to defend against more than one class action suit based on alleged violations of securities law where the different lawsuits arise from the same transaction. When a corporation settles with one group of plaintiffs who purport to represent shareholders, another group of plaintiffs should not be permitted to extort additional settlement funds by claiming to represent the same shareholders, WLF argued.<P>

<b>Limits On Judicial Campaign Contributions Proposed</B><P>
WLF filed a petition with California Bar authorities recommending that trial lawyers be prohibited from making judicial campaign contributions. Studies cited by WLF show that in California and elsewhere, plaintiffs' trial lawyers have contributed enormous amounts to judges before whom they practice, creating the impression that justice can be bought. Fifteen top California trial lawyers gave almost $1 million to candidates for judicial office.<P>

<B>FDA Requested To Ease Rules on Direct-to-Consumer Ads</B><P>
A citizen petition filed by WLF with the Food and Drug Administration urged the agency to adopt a policy recognizing that direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription drugs can play a helpful role in providing consumers with truthful information about prescription drugs and also recognizing that truthful, non-misleading advertising of prescription drugs receives significant protection under the First Amendment. WLF recommended that the agency replace its current case-by-case review of such advertising with rules setting out "a very limited, very clearly-defined" set of improper advertising practices, giving manufacturers fair notice of what advertising is impermissible.

<html><title>No Free Lunch for Lobbyists -- Heritage</title>
<center><img src="/heritage/thf_log2.gif"></center>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center><h2>September Insider : No Free Lunch for Lobbyists</h2><br></center>
  by Charles P. Griffin, Deputy House Liaison at the Heritage Foundation<p><hr><P>

The best-kept "dirty little secret" in Washington these days may be the millions of taxpayer dollars that are siphoned off each year to fund welfare for lobbyists. Over the past forty years, Congress has helped create a vast patronage network of organizations that enjoy tax-preferred status, receive federal funds, and engage in legislative or political advocacy.<P>
Almost every interest in America from agriculture to zoology has one or more organizations receiving government funding. Recipients range from the American Association of Retired Persons, which received over $73 million in a one-year period, to the American Bar Association, which received $2.2 million. This subsidy forces the taxpayer to foot the bill for a range of ideologically driven organizations.<P>
The coercive power of the federal government should not be used to force taxpayers to finance organizations which lobby Congress or other government entities.Taxpayer funding of advocacy organizations is wrong fiscally, morally, and logically. It is fiscally irresponsible to spend federal revenues on activities that provide no meaningful return to the American people. It is morally wrong for the government to take sides in any public policy debate by assisting the advocacy activities of an elite few. And it is logically wrong for the government to fund activities that often result in lobbying for increased federal expenditures. <P>
Every federal dollar frees private resources to be spent on political, lobbying, and other advocacy activities. Moreover, federal funds make the organization appear to be a larger force in the political arena than it would if it were totally reliant upon private contributions. For example, the National Council of Senior Citizens receives more than $70 million 96 percent of its funding from the federal government. While enjoying a generous federal subsidy, this proponent of big government actively engages in a broad range of overtly partisan political activity.<P>  
Unfortunately, the NCSC is but one of many advocacy organizations receiving federal funds. The National Trust for Historic Preservation received approximately $7 million from the federal government in FY 1994, 22 percent of its budget. In addition to opposing economic development nationwide, the Trust recently sent a letter to members of Congress urging them to "vote no" on a possible amendment in the House to reduce their taxpayer subsidy. It is no wonder that this nation has a multi-trillion dollar debt when federally-funded organizations can so blatantly lobby Congress for more money.<P>
Existing auditing of federal grants by the government does not provide the level of scrutiny needed to root out abuse. The following should be essential parts of any congressional efforts to curb current abuses:<P>
To solve this problem, no advocacy organization that receives federal funds should be permitted to engage in anything but incidental lobbying activities, except on issues directly related to its tax status. The consequences for violating the prohibition on federally subsidized lobbying must be sufficient to discourage organizations from violating the standards. Under no circumstances should any organization that willingly and knowingly violates the prohibitions receive further federal funding.<P>
In addition, to shed more light on this "dirty little secret," witnesses testifying before Congress should be required to divulge in their oral and written testimonies whether they receive federal funds and, if so, for what purpose and in what amount. This will permit committees to view the testimony in an appropriate light<P>.
It's time for this Congress to end welfare for lobbyists. Taxpayers should no longer be forced to subsidize political activity with which they disagree. Thomas Jefferson anticipated this debate over two hundred years ago when he correctly stated, "To compel a man to furnish funds for the propagation of ideas he disbelieves and abhors is sinful and tyrannical."<P>
Mr. Jefferson must be spinning in his grave.<P>

<b>NATO's Role in European Stability</B>,edited by Stephen A. Cambone
<br>The Center for
Strategic & International Studies<p>

The Center for Strategic
and International Studies addresses the current political debate
over the redefinition and transformation of NATO, which dates
back to the very beginnings of the post-Cold War era. The report
examines the question of how to restructure the transatlantic
partnership in light of the recent discussions surrounding the
future membership of Eastern European nations into NATO. The report
also considers how NATO should have responded to the situation
in Bosnia. CSIS compiles the opinions of various academics and
foreign policy experts on the rightful course for NATO during
its transformation period. Walter Slocombe, US undersecretary
of defense for policy, lists four basic principles that must be
kept in mind during NATO's expansion: &quot;First, NATO is an
effective alliance, not a system of paper guarantees. Second,
it is an alliance of free nations and is committed to the principles
of liberty. Third, it works by consensus. Fourth, NATO is ultimately
a military organization.&quot; 67 pp. CONTACT: The Center for

<b>The
B-2 Bomber: Failure to Buy More Could Compromise Security in the
Next Century</B>, by Jim Courter and Loren Thompson
<br>Alexis de Tocqueville
Institution<p>The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution presents the
case for why the production of the B-2 bomber, popularly know
as the stealth bomber, should not be curtailed as it is essential
to the maintenance of US security. The report warns against terminating
the production of the B-2 after the government has committed over
$20 billion to its development since the last decade of the Cold
War. The study concludes that it would be more cost effective
to continue the production of the bomber, despite its high price
tag, because the cost of every available alternative that can
achieve future military objectives is considerably higher. Courter
and Thompson also espouse the belief that possession of the B2
is critical to US security in light of the trend towards the globalization
of advanced technologies; this suggests that the present generation
of US aircraft will be outdated by early next century. 53 pp.

<b>From
Shadows to Substance: an Action Plan for Transatlantic Defense
Cooperation</b><br>The Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies<p>

The
Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies issues a conference
report from their February 1995 conference held to discuss the
prospects for transatlantic defense cooperation in today's political
environment. Policy makers, industrialists, and academics met
to investigate the possibilities of establishing cooperative measures
between the US and Europe in the areas of military research, development,
and production. In this report, CSIS attests to the positive gains
made toward establishing transatlantic partnerships for future
US defense programs, to enable more programs to come to fruition.
The conference did conclude, however, leaving some ambiguity:&quot;the
interoperability argument for transatlantic defense cooperation
has shifted from enabling allied forces to meet a possible joint
threat in a cohesive and efficient manner to enabling alliance
members to undertake multinational operations outside NATO's area.&quot;

<b>The Purposes of Russian Aid: Supporting Democratic
Capitalism</b>, by Ariel Cohen
<br><a href="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/bg1041.html">Backgrounder No. 1041</a>, The Heritage
Foundation<p>

Ariel Cohen, a Salvatori Fellow in Russian and Eurasian
Studies at The Heritage Foundation, advocates re-examining the
aid that the US plans to give to Russia and the Newly Independent
States in FY 1996 and in FY 1997 which will be up for a vote in
the Senate shortly. Cohen points out that US-Russian cooperation
is ebbing due to the following: Russia's intervention in Chechnya,
Moscow's refusal to end the sale of nuclear reactors to Iran,
and the lack of free-market reforms that have been enacted, since
Gorbachev's perestroika began ten years ago. The author recommends
that the Senate preface the allocation of the aid based upon six
contingencies: &quot;1) demand that the Administration suspend
negotiations to reschedule the Russian and Soviet debt to Western
creditors if the proposed sale of nuclear reactors to Iran is
completed; 2) condition US support for IMF credits to the Russian
government on a cease-fire in Chechnya; 3) create an independent
board to manage aid to Russia and the NIS; 4) reprogram $225 million
to develop democracy in Russia and the NIS by abolishing the Commodities
Import Program and the Russian Officer Resettlement Program; 5)
make democratic development a top priority; 6) target grants directly
to democratic institutions in Russia and the NIS.&quot; 13 pp.

<b>The United States and Future Bosnias</B>,
Jonathan G. Clarke
<br>Foreign Policy Briefing No. 36, Cato Institute<p>
Foreign
policy studies research fellow Jonathan Clarke of the Cato Institute
equates the importance of US foreign policy towards Bosnia as
setting the precedent for future policy towards other Eastern
European nations where conflict is erupting. Thus, according to
the author, the manner in which the US proceeds is paramount.
The author advocates a policy of nonintervention towards Bosnia
based on three main arguments: 1) the war in Bosnia is an intracommunal
dispute and is not an aberration from past, present, or future
conflicts that comprise Europe's history; 2) unlike Nazi Germany
and the Soviet Union, conflicts such as Bosnia do not pose a threat
to US security; 3) intracommunal conflicts make it difficult for
the US to distinguish between the aggressor and the victim. Clarke
concludes that &quot;failure to draw the appropriate lessons from
the Bosnian debacle will cause the United States to end up repeating
the same mistakes elsewhere in Europe.&quot; 12 pp. CONTACT: The

are still needed despite the latest round of base closing, which
insufficiently reduced the size of military forces, personnel,
and budgets down to the size recommended by the Defense Base Closure
and Realignment Commission. The author explains that insufficient
base closings pose a very grave threat to US security; moneys
spent maintaining excessive bases only detract from vital military
readiness and modernization programs. Thus, the author advocates
extending the base closure process for another two rounds to ensure
that base infrastructure, which has only been reduced by 15 percent
since 1985, approaches the 25 percent cuts in military personnel
during the same time period. The paper also recommends that additional
oversight be made in any upcoming base closings so that the procedure
does not become politicized by the upcoming presidential race;
the electoral map and presidential politics should not influence
which bases are selected to be closed. 8 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis,

<b>Venezuela:
The Quiet Crisis Deepens</b>, by Mark Falcoff
<br>Latin American Outlook,
American Enterprise Institute
<p>Venezuela has long since passed its
days of economic prosperity that it enjoyed in the 1960s and 70s.
Mark Falcoff, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute,
outlines the causes of  this collapse and the political, social,
and economic policies that continue to sabotage efforts to put
Venezuela back on track. The author reveals that President Caldera
has supported dangerous economic reforms that include the following:
1) price controls that will increase shortages of basic foodstuffs
and articles on necessity; 2) foreign exchange controls that hurt
businesses by creating shortages of needed raw materials and parts;
3) and finally, a deliberate effort to stall any effort that move
towards privatization. These policies do not bode well for the
Venezuelan economic crisis that continues to worsen, fostering
even more support for a military coup that could truncate Caldera's
presidency. 4 pp. Contact: American Enterprise Institute, 1150

<b>How to
Close Down the Department of Transportation</b>, by Ronald D. Utt
and Wendell Cox
<br><a href="/heritage/library/catagories/bugettax/bg1048.html">Backgrounder No. 1048, The Heritage Foundation</a>
<P>
Ronald
Utt, visiting Heritage Fellow, and Wendell Cox, director of state
policy and legislation for the American Legislative Exchange Council,
present the process through which the Department of Transportation,
created in 1966, has grown into the enormously inefficient bureaucracy
that exists today. Utt and Cox state that this fiscal year's budget
allocates $39 billion to the DOT, with nearly $19 billion going
to highways. According to this study, much of the department's
spending is derived from the Highway Trust Fund, which is replenished
by the federal fuel tax paid by motorists at the gas pump, and
the Aviation Trust Fund, financed largely by a passenger ticket
tax and several lesser aviation taxes. Utt and Cox demonstrate
that the DOT has remained mostly unchanged in its structure and
purpose since 1966; however both the Congress and the White House
now agree that major reform is necessary. Even modest reform proposals
have met opposition with House Republicans, but the Senate Republicans
have proven their commitment to fundamental reform, urging greater
privatization and federalism in transportation issues. This report
argues that the reforms emerging from conference are not enough,
further reforms in the following areas are necessary: surface
transportation; the end of federal mandates which have inflated
state transportation costs and deterred the development of creative,
low-cost transportation solutions; and urban mass transit. This
paper suggest the elimination of the Federal Transit Administration;
privatizing Amtrak; privatization of air traffic control and the
devolution of federal control to the states; and the transfer
of Coast Guard responsibilities to the Department of Justice.

C. Weinstein, and John D. Graham<br>
Risk Analysis Vol. 15 No. 3, Harvard
Center for Risk Analysis<p>
The team of experts who produced this
important paper gathered information on the cost-effectiveness
of life-saving interventions in the United States from publicly
available economic analyses. &quot;Life-saving interventions&quot;
were defined as any behavioral and/or technological strategies
that reduce the possibility of premature death among a specified
target population. This paper defines cost effectiveness as the
net resource costs of an intervention per year of life saved.
The 587 interventions identified in this work ranged from those
that saved more resources than they cost, to those costing more
than $10 billion per year of life saved. This paper finds the
median intervention costs $42,000 per lifeyear saved; the median
medical intervention costs $19,000 per life-year saved, the median
injury -eduction costs $48,000 per life-year, and toxin control
costs $2,800,000 per life-year saved. 21 pp. CONTACT: The Harvard

<b>Time to Reopen the Clean Air Act: Clearing Away the

Policy Analysis
No. 233, Cato Institute<p>
K.H. Jones, president of Zephyr Consulting
Company, and Jonathan Adler, associate director of environmental
studies at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, maintain that
the national policy on the control of urban smog is misguided
because it fails to account for current pollution trends and is
based on the anomalous meteorological conditions of 1988. This
misguided policy, according to this paper, has led to &quot;regulatory
overkill&quot; by the Environmental Protection Agency. Jones and
Adler state that this particularly affects the Ozone Transport
Region, the twelve states from Virginia to Maine, imposing emissary
control strategies that are not only unnecessary, ineffective,
and expensive, but are also scientifically insupportable. The
authors write, &quot;control for control's sake pollution control
strategies pursued by the EPA and the OTC are largely inappropriate
because they are neither costeffective nor equitable means of
achieving emissions reductions, even should such reductions be
necessary.&quot; The authors conclude that legislative action
is necessary to alleviate unneeded and costly regulatory mandates.

Alan Reynolds, the Hudson Institute's
director of economic research, has adapted his testimony before
the House Republican Joint Economic Committee and House Republican
Policy Committee Briefing on the Dollar to produce this paper.
Reynolds gives a &quot;graphic&quot; demonstration of how the
federal government's policies are driving the US economy toward
a new boat of stagflation. This paper compares the state of the
current economy with the conditions of 197475, 197982, and 199091.
Current actions by the federal government point towards stagflations:
America's increasingly hostile tax climate for domestic savings
and foreign investment. Reynolds suggests that the decline of
the dollar is not the result of budget deficit or the Federal
Reserve's interest rate; but that the steady decline may be halted
with appropriate tax and monetary policies, including tax incentives

the fact that the earned income tax credit (EITC) was designed

accounting to look at the future stream of government taxes, transfers,
and expenditures. The findings suggest that Canada's current fiscal
policies are unsustainable. Good explains why the Canadian government
sector, with enormously higher unfunded future liabilities is
overspending at a vastly greater rate than the US. The paper recommends
a &quot;freeze and growth through productivity&quot; policy, which
means that at each age, an individual's taxes are increased at

<b>A Guide to Medicare Reform Proposals</b>,

Heritage policy
analyst John Liu describes the need for action in Medicare when
Congress returns from its summer recess. Liu writes, &quot;To
avoid the collapse of program, Congress has only two choices:
1) Do not change significantly the way Medicare is run by the
government, and assure future new revenues through higher payroll
taxes and other taxes or by diverting money from other programs;
or 2) Fundamentally change the way Medicare is run so that benefits
are delivered more efficiently, thereby avoiding future tax increases
or a diversion of money from other programs. This approach would
aim to slow the rate at which costs are anticipated to grow. This
paper assesses the proposals from the Clinton administration,
Brookings Institution, Heritage Foundation, National Center for
Policy Analysis, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security
and Medicare, United Seniors Association, and major organizations
representing health care providers. Liu presents the approach
of the various groups' proposals, and shows how they address the

Patrick
Fagan, the William H.G. Fitzgerald Senior Fellow in Family and
Cultural Issues at The Heritage Foundation, argues that adoption
must be part of any plan to reform welfare. Fagan cites statistics
which show outofwedlock births reaching nearly 40 percent by the
year 2000 and 50 percent by the year 2012, and he questions why,
out of the 500,000 children in the foster care system, only 50,000
were cleared for adoption each year. Fagan suggests that adoption
addresses many of the current problems with the welfare system:
unwed mothers, children in abusive homes, children in foster care,
and costs to the state and federal governments. Fagan argues,
&quot;Adoption increases the emotional, physical, and cognitive
capacities of the children who are adopted. It improves the life
chances of the biological mother. It saves vast amounts of money
for the taxpayer. It brings much happiness to the adopting parents.
It is good for all involved. Adoption works.&quot; 30 pp. CONTACT:

<b>Should
We Worry About Ozone</b>, by Jane S. Shaw and Richard L. Stroup<BR>
Policy
Report No. 191, National Center for Policy Analysis<P>Jane Shaw and
Richard Stroup, senior associates with the Political Economy Research
Center, challenge the theory held by some scientists that the
depletion of stratospheric ozone is substantial and will grow
to alarming levels unless the use of CFCs and some related chemical
compounds is eliminated. The authors argue that the theory of
largescale depletion caused by human use of these chemicals is
not yet supported by solid scientific evidence. This paper presents
five areas of unresolved issues regarding the ozone: 1) it is
not clear that stratospheric ozone is being significantly depleted
worldwide, or that any depletion that may have occurred is permanent;
2) if the ozone layer is being depleted, it is not clear that
CFCs are the major cause or that reducing their use now will stop
or even slow depletion; 3) it appears that the &quot;ozone hole&quot;
above Antarctica is caused by unique conditions, and it is uncertain
whether additional or reduced chlorine from CFCs would affected
it; 4) even if ozone depletion does occur, there is no reliable
evidence that it will represent a grave threat to living things
on earth; and 5) the cost of eliminating CFCs for refrigeration
and cooling are higher than most people realize, with estimates
reaching nearly $100 billion over the next 10 years in the United
States alone. The authors conclude that the Montreal Protocol
banning CFCs should be changed to make the phaseout more gradual,
and the costs (including such social costs as the loss of safety)
of halting CFC production should be weighed against the small
and uncertain benefits. 21 pp. CONTACT: National Center for Policy

<B>Progressive Environmentalism: Principles for Regulatory
Reform</b>, by Kent Jeffries<BR>Policy Report No. 194, National Center
for Policy Analysis<P>

National Center for Policy Analysis senior
fellow Kent Jeffries suggests that any regulatory reform bill
approved by Congress will only be a first step toward removing
governmental abuses without sacrificing overall environmental
quality. Jeffries argues that Congress must still reauthorize
or review a host of environmental programs individually, including
Superfund, pesticide regulations, the Endangered Species Act,
the Clean Water Act, and the Clean Air Act. This paper recommends
three guiding principles with which to examine these programs:
the federalism rule, which requires regulatory decisions to be
made by the smallest possible government entity; the costbenefit
rule, which considers whether the costs of a proposed regulation
reasonably reflect it benefits; and the compensation rule, under
which property owners are compensated for their losses if property
rights are taken or diminished by a regulation. Jeffries writes,
&quot;The regulatory reform bill is important, but if Congress
is to make the reform truly meaningful, it must define a role
for government in environmental regulation that gives people the
right incentives, that protects property rights, and that spends
the public money wisely.&quot; 44 pp. CONTACT: National Center

<B>Beyond the Grazing Fee: An Agenda for
Rangeland Reform</b>, by Karl Hess Jr. and Jerry L. Holecheck<BR>Policy
Analysis No. 234, Cato Institute<P>
Karl Hess, Cato senior fellow
in environmental studies, and Jerry Holecheck, professor of rangeland
studies at New Mexico State University, argue that the results
of more than a century of grazing on public land are testimony
to the failure of landuse socialism. This paper asserts that taxpayers
have paid for federally supervised and subsidized grazing, and
ranchers, the intended beneficiaries, have gained little except
debt, insecurity, and mountains of regulations, while environmental
quality has suffered. Hess and Holecheck address Interior Secretary
Bruce Babbitt's plan, arguing that &quot;it ignores the institutional
impediments that have made overgrazing and land abuse official
programs of the federal government, and it leaves unchanged the
federal policies that discourage rancher stewardship and pay stockmen
to overgraze and reward them for poor management practices.&quot;
This article presents four methods of reform: 1) placing the fiscal
burden of maintaining these lands on the ranchers; 2) opening
access to these lands for purposes other than grazing livestock;
3) decentralizing control over federal lands in selected areas
on a trial basis; and 4) extending the local control and opening
debate on partial or full divestiture of public rangelands. 27

A Half Step in the Right Direction</b>, by William H. Lash III<br>
Contemporary
Issues No. 73, Center for the Study of American Business<P>
William
Lash, adjunct fellow at the Center for the Study of American Business,
finds that Congress, fearing an &quot;economic apocalypse where
millions of fleeced investors withdraw from securities markets
that fail to adequately protect them&quot; is reluctant to pass
pending legislation that would provide some protection to companies
facing groundless securities litigation. Lash proposes six aspects
of reform: 1) institute a loser pays all court cost provision;
2) require a meaningful investment by plaintiffs in strike suits;
3) require specific allegations of actual fraud or recklessness;
4) abolish RICO liability for securities suits; 5) limit the number
of lawsuits that may be brought by professional plaintiffs to
five cases in a three year period; and 6) require the Securities
and Exchange Commission to adopt rules providing a &quot;safe
harbor&quot; for corporations making positive, forwardlooking
statements in their corporate reports, so that companies are not
forces to play down bright prospects to investors simply to protect
the firm from possible frivolous securities lawsuits. Lash concludes
that the constant specter of groundless securities litigation
deters many worthy individuals from joining corporate boards and
wastes corporate resources while rewarding a handful of unscrupulous
attorneys. 20 pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business,

1995 Crime Bill: Is the GOP the Party of Liberty and Limited Government?</b>,
by Jarett B. Decker<BR>
Policy Analysis No. 229, Cato Institute<P>
Jarett
Decker, a Minnesota attorney, accuses the new Republican Congress
of fighting crime by expanding federal power, just like past Democratic
Congresses. Decker argues that, despite the April 26 Supreme Court
ruling on the Lopez case, the 1995 GOP crime bill continue the
trends of recent years by making every local crime a federal crime.
According to this paper, federal prosecutors would be given even
more power under the GOP crime bills, while the rights of defendants
and the powers of judges would be curtailed. The authors demonstrates
that &quot;both the House and Senate bills give a green light
to government lawlessness,&quot; weakening constitutional protections
against invasions of private homes, raids on businesses, and detentions
of citizens in the course of criminal investigations. Decker concludes
that the 1995 crime bills are a step in the wrong direction, further
removing the US from constitutional checks and balances toward
a regime of unchecked power. 33 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000

<B>Crime
and Punishment in America</B>, by Morgan O. Reynolds<br>
Policy Report
No. 193, National Center for Policy Analysis<P>

Morgan Reynolds, director
of the Criminal Justice Center at the National Center for Policy
Analysis, reports that the rate of serious crime has tripled since
the 1960s, and the author suggests that one explanation lies in
the fact that &quot;crime pays.&quot; Expected punishments have
been steadily declining, roughly an 80 percent decline since the
1950s. This paper uses Texas' and California's imprisonment rates
as examples of the correlation between crimes and expected punishments.
The author demonstrates that the cost of building and maintaining
prisons is high, but the investment pays off with lower levels
of crime. 26 pp. CONTACT: National Center for Policy Analysis,

strengthen the American family by restoring religious equality,
allowing local control of education, promoting school choice,
protecting parental rights, providing familyfriendly tax relief,
restoring respect for human life, encouraging support of private

Douglas Kmiec, professor at the Notre Dame Law
School, addresses the need for a rediscovery and a rededication
to standards of personal and cultural virtue that seem to elude
American society today. Kmiec suggests that change should be practical,
starting with Americans learning how to talk, not shout or insult
or present categorical demands. The author presents realistic
suggestions to restore families to their rightful role and avoid

<B>Orphanages:
Did They Throttle the Children in Their Care?</B>, by Richard B. McKenzie<BR>
Center
of the American Experiment<P>

Economist Richard McKenzie presents
his preliminary findings from a survey of several hundred former
orphans, all of whom are now middleaged or older. Despite the
claims of child care professionals who condemn orphanages, the
survey found that when compared to their counterparts in the general
population, the orphans have: a lower divorce rate; a higher level
of education; a higher mean income; a far lower unemployment rate;
a far lower poverty rate; a minuscule rate of reliance on public
assistance; a minuscule arrest rate; a substantially lower rate
of mental and emotional disorders; and a higher rate of participation
in elections. McKenzie also reports that the majority of orphans
state that they prefer the way they grew up to the way they would
have grown up in foster care or in their own families. The author
contrasts the success of the orphans with the lowered expectations
of child care professionals for those growing up in orphanages.

<b>Cornell Professor
Sues Over Harassment Conviction</b><br>
The Center for Individual Rights
has filed a lawsuit against Cornell University on behalf of Professor
James B. Maas.  The lawsuit demands $1.5 million in damages for
Cornell's actions in finding Maas guilty of alleged &quot;sexual
harassment.&quot;<p>
Jim Maas, a professor of psychology, is one of
Cornell's most prominent faculty members.  He has a record of
31 years of distinguished service to the Cornell community.<P>
The
lawsuit, filed today in Tompkins County Supreme Court, demands
redress for a yearlong, ruinous witch hunt against Maas.  In a
proceeding over sexual harassment charges filed by former students
in May 1994, Maas was convicted as a &quot;sexual harasser&quot;
on stale and unproven charges; was subjected to an adjudicatory
&quot;process&quot; that was administered by fanatical faculty
members devoid of even the most basic elements of procedural fairness;
was forced to watch helplessly as unsubstantiated rumors and halftruths
were peddled to the local, national, and international press,
besmirching his reputation and severely damaging his ability to
function as a teacher and a scholar; and was ignored by Cornell's
feckless administrators when he protested the egregious violations
of Cornell's established procedures and of the confidentiality
rules that were supposed to govern the proceedings in his case.<P>

<b>Oral
Arguments Made in Hopwood v. State of Texas</b><br>
On Tuesday, August
8, the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit heard oral arguments
in the case of Hopwood v. State of Texas.  The case was brought
by Cheryl Hopwood and three other unsuccessful applicants for
admission to the University of Texas Law School.  The plaintiffs,
who are white, claim that the law school discriminated against
them by maintaining a racebased admissions system that was intentionally
biased in favor of black and Mexican American applicants.<P>
The case
is an appeal from a decision handed down by US District Court
Judge Sam Sparks in August 1994.  The judge found that the Law
School had indeed operated a racially discriminatory admission
system in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's equal protection
clause, noting that the school had maintained separate admissions
committees to evaluate applications from members of different
racial groups.  The judge also observed that blacks and MexicanAmericans
were presumptively admitted with test scores and college grade
point averages lower than those set for the presumptive rejection
of whites.<P>
Nevertheless, Judge Sparks refused to order the plaintiffs'
admission to the law school because they failed to prove that
they would have been admitted except for the unconstitutional
program.  Moreover, the judge refused to award damages of more
than one dollar, finding that the law school had acted in &quot;good
faith&quot; when it violated the plaintiffs' rights.  And because
the judge found the law school's admission program no longer to
be in violation of the equal protection clausebecause it had discarded
the segregated admission tracks and separate admissions committees
by the time the case went to trialhe refused to order any change
in the school's admissions procedures.<P>
The law school, however,
has never disavowed the use of race as a factor in its admissions
process; indeed, it continues to treat an applicant's status as
black or MexicanAmerican as a &quot;plus.&quot;  Such preference
is given automatically, without regard to the applicant's socioeconomic
background, and to both Texas residents and nonresidents.<P>
During
the oral argument, the plaintiffs asked the Fifth Circuit to order
the law school to offer them admission.  In addition, the plaintiffs
asked the appellate court to remand the case so that they may
seek an award of nontrivial monetary damages.  Most significantly,
however, the appeal asks that the law school be prevented from
using race as it currently does as a criterion in student admissions.
 In this respect, the case presents the Court of Appeals with
an opportunity to clarify the meaning of University of California
Regents v. Bakke, a 1978 Supreme Court ruling having to do with
the constitutionality of racebased admissions procedures at a
statesupported medical college.<P>

<b>Institute
Comes to the Defense of School Choice</b><br>
The American Civil Liberties
Union (ACLU) and the Milwaukee Teachers Education Association
(MTEA), joined by People for the American Way and Americans for
the Separation of Church and State, filed lawsuits in early July
in state court in Madison challenging the constitutionality of
the recently expanded Milwaukee Parental Choice Program.<P>
The Institute's
petition to intervene as defendants on behalf of the grassroots
group Parents for School Choice and eight lowincome families who
will participate in the program, was granted Friday, August 4.
 Landmark Legal Foundation will represent another group of lowincome
families from its previous lawsuit.  On August 17, the Wisconsin
Supreme Court granted the Governor's petition for original action
jurisdiction and will promptly consider the plaintiffs' motion
for preliminary injunction.<P>
The ACLU lawsuit challenges the program
under the religion clauses of the United States and Wisconsin
constitutions.  The MTEA lawsuit adds claims under the &quot;private
or local&quot; bill provision of the Wisconsin Constitution and
the &quot;Public purpose&quot; doctrine.  The suits have been
consolidated and the plaintiffs are seeking injunction before
the school year starts.<P>

<b>Freedom Hits the Streets of Denver</b><br>
The Institute's
efforts to break through the taxicab monopoly in Denver bore fruit
on August 1st with the grand opening of Freedom Cabs.  Run by
Leroy Jones, Ani Ebong, and Girma Molalegne, Freedom Cabs is the
first new cab company to open its doors in Denver since 1947.<P>
 The entrepreneurs first challenged Denver's taxicab monopoly
in January 1993 when they joined with the Institute to file a
lawsuit against the Colorado Public Utilities Commission, which
regulates taxis in the state.  Later, due to the lawsuit's high
visibility, the Colorado legislature passed a law opening the
Denver taxi market.<br>This lawsuit is part of a comprehensive effort
by the Institute for Justice to restore judicial protection for
&quot;economic liberty&quot;the basic civil right of every American
to pursue a business or profession free from arbitrary or excessive
government regulation.<p>

<b>Institute Files Amicus Opposing Civil Forfeiture<br></b>
The
Institute filed an amicus in Bennis v. State of Michigan, fighting
the government's ability to forfeit the property of wholly innocent
owners.  The state forfeited Ms. Bennis' interest in her automobile
because her husband used the car for prostitution.  Ms. Bennis
committed no wrong and had no knowledge of the illegal use of
her property.  Nevertheless, the State of Michigan provides no
recourse for innocent owners.<P>
The Institute's brief critiques civil
forfeiture from a property rights perspective and argues that
forfeiture of property held by truly innocent owners is unduly
oppressive and violates the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth
Amendment.  Furthermore, the law should not place affirmative
obligations on individuals to police the actions of third parties.
 Rather, the burden should be on the government to demonstrate
that an owner negligently entrusted property to another in order
to expose that individual to civil forfeiture.  The Institute
will also fight the forfeiture of Ms. Bennis' rights in the automobile
on the ground of taking of private property without just compensation.<p>

<h3>National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation</h3><p>
<b>Virginia Supreme Court Upholds Redskins' Right
to Work</b><br>
The Supreme Court of Virginia refused a petition for appeal
by National Football League Player Association (NFLPA) union officials
to overturn a lower court's ruling barring the NFLPA from seizing
forced dues from sixteen current and former Washington Redskins
players, National Right to Work Foundation attorneys announced
today.<p>
The ruling upheld a lower court decision by Loudoun County
Circuit Judge Thomas D. Horne.  Horne last year ruled that it
is a violation of Virginia's Right to Work law for NFLPA union
officials to force Redskin players to pay union dues as a condition
of employment.<p>
Horne's ruling permanently barred player union officials
from requiring former Redskins tight end Terry Orr and other players
to pay union dues.  Orr and fifteen former and current Redskins
players were represented in their legal action by attorneys from
the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation.<p>
  &quot;This
is another enforcement action to guarantee employee rights under
Virginia's Right to Work law, &quot; said Foundation VicePresident
Timothy McConville.  He added, &quot;Every step of the way in
this case, we've prevailed and protected employees' right not
to pay compulsory union dues just to keep their jobs.&quot;<P>

In
December of 1993, NFLPA union officials nearly forced the Redskins
to forfeit their final regular season game by threatening to have
the players who exercised their Right to Work suspended.<p>
The union
claimed that the Redskins were employed in Washington, DC, where
they play their home games, and therefore not covered by Virginia
law.<p>
But the lower court declared that because the Redskins spend
the overwhelming majority of their work time at Redskins Park
in Loudoun County, Virginia, they are Virginia employees, protected
by the state's Right to Work law.<p>
In contrast, players typically
spend only 60 hours before, during, and after home games working
in the District of Columbia.<p>

<h3>The Rutherford Institute</h3><p>
<b>Supreme
Court Allows Student Initiated Graduation Prayer</b><br>
On June 26 the
Supreme Court vacated the decision of the Ninth Circuit Court
of Appeals in Harris v. Joint School District.  The court's decision
effectively upholds the right to studentinitiated prayer at public
high school graduations.  The Rutherford Institute represented
students in the case.<P>
The case began in 1991, when the ACLU filed
suit against the public high school in Grangeville, Idaho, for
allowing studentinitiated prayer at their graduation ceremony.
 The high school gave complete control over the ceremony to seniors
who voted to include a benediction and invocation.  Initially,
a federal district court ruled in favor of the school, but the
court of appeals reversed the decision, holding that graduation
prayer violated the first amendmentregardless of whether or not
the prayers were studentinitiated.  The Ninth Circuit's decision
was in direct conflict with an earlier decision from the Fifth
Circuit upholding student-initiated graduation prayer.<p>
&quot;The
Supreme Court's refusal to hear the case on the merits means that
the uncertainty over the legality of student-initiated prayer will
continue,&quot; said Rutherford staff attorney Mark Beutler. 
&quot;I am pleased nonetheless that the Court vacated the Ninth
Circuit's decision.  Now students in western states can once again
decide to include prayer in their graduation ceremonies.&quot;<p>
<b>Rutherford
Sues California Superintendent Delaine Easton</b><br>
California State
Superintendent of Schools Delaine Easton as well as a half dozen
other school superintendents have been named defendants in a lawsuit
against the state of California regarding administration of the
California Learning Assessment Systems (CLAS) test.  Despite Governor
Pete Wilson's veto on funding for the controversial CLAS tests,
schools continue to administer test materials without parental
consent or notice.<p>The complaint was amended on Monday, June 19,
to argue that the state violated not only parental rights guarded
by the Constitution, but also federal civil rights laws.  A court
date has been set for October 23, 1995.<p>The original suit, filed
April 21, 1994, sought a temporary restraining order to stop six
San Bernardino County School districts from giving the CLAS test.
 The test requires children to answer personal questions about
their family values, practices, and beliefs as well as questions
pertaining to their relationship with their parents.  Children's
answers may then be referred to Child Protective Services without
ever notifying parents how the test results are being used.  Not
only parents, but also state senators, school board members, and
teachers were denied the opportunity to examine the test before
it was administered.  The defendants in the lawsuit continue to
assert that they have done nothing wrong, insisting that parents
have no right to shield their children from questionable materials
found in public schools.<p>
&quot;This battle will not end until the
State Department of Education is forced to recognize the rights
of parents to guide the education of their children,&quot; said
Frank J. Mistretta, Jr., an attorney handling the case, adding,
&quot;Now is definitely not the time to drop the ball on defending
parents' rights.&quot;<p>
<b>Rutherford Institute Defends School Against
ACLU Suit</b><br>
On June 30, The Rutherford Institute filed a posttrial
brief on behalf of Upshur County Board of Education and Superintendent
Lynn Westfall in response to a lawsuit brought against the school
by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU).  The ACLU sued the
school administration for allowing a citizen group to place a
box of free Bibles for students on school property.<p>
The posttrial
brief filed by The Rutherford Institute requests the court to
rule in favor of the school.  The brief argues that the school
acted neutrally by permitting religious materials to be made available
on the same terms and under the same conditions as nonreligious
materials.<P>
The case began on December 6, 1994, when the school
board voted to permit a citizen group comprised of local businesses
to place boxes of Bibles in the Upshur County Public Schools on
February 27, 1995, for students to pick up on a voluntary basis.
 As a result, on February 23, 1995, the ACLU on behalf of several
parents, sued the school and obtained an order forbidding the
school from permitting anyone to make Bibles available to students
while the case was pending.<p>
&quot;We are hopeful that in light
of the Supreme Court's decision in Rosenberger and Pinette, the
court will not require the school to treat private religious speech
occurring during the school day differently than nonreligious
speech,&quot; said Dean Whitford, The Rutherford Institute attorney
handling the case, along with Attorney Michael D. Lorensen.<P>

of an employee drug testing program adopted by the City of Glendale,
California.  The city adopted the program in response to the results

<b>Supreme Court Asked To Review Decision on &quot;Green&quot;
Ad Ban</b><br>
WLF filed a brief urging the U.S. Supreme Court to hear

environmental claims in advertising.  For example, no product
may be labeled or advertised as &quot;recyclable&quot; unless
convenient recycling facilities for the product exist in every

<b>Protection
of Civil Liberties In OSHA Investigations Sought</b><br>
A petition for

Administration (OSHA) argued that the agency should adopt procedures
for protecting the civil liberties of employers during inspections
and investigations.  The petition urged OSHA to provide a &quot;statement
of employers' rights and responsibilities&quot; prior to every
inspection.  Currently, OSHA does not require its inspectors to
inform employers of any of their rights.  WLF's proposed statement
explains employers' rights, including the right to refuse an inspection
that is not authorized by a warrant or its equivalent, to consult
one's legal counsel, and to accompany the inspector throughout
the inspection.  The petition is in response to the results of
WLF's research into OSHA inspection procedures, which disclosed
that OSHA lacks adequate regulations or internal rules for protecting
civil liberties.<p>

<title> Robbing Peter to Pay Grandma
 -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<h2>August <i>Insider</i> -- Robbing Peter To Pay Grandma</h2>
<i><b>by John Liu</i></b>
<hr>

<p>Sunday, July 30, 1995, marked the 30th birthday for one of the federal government's largest and most costly programsMedicare, the huge national health insurance program that covers over 37 million elderly and disabled Americans. Medicare was heralded by proponents as both "historic" and "fiscally responsible." Now, however, Medicare is essentially bankrupt, and its ability to maintain the quality of its services is in doubt. What is not in doubt, is the harsh reality that liberals must face up toMedicare is anything but a fiscally responsible program. The hospitalization insurance (HI) trust fund is projected to be insolvent by the year 2002. Equally important, the cost of the Medicare Supplemental Medical Insurance (SMI) program is exploding. 
Furthermore, U.S. demographics guarantee enormous future burdens on working families. In 1965, when Medicare was enacted, there were almost six workers to every retiree. Today, there are only four. And by 2030, when the nation's 77 million "baby boomers" are well into their retirement, there will be only two workers for every retiree.
<p>
There is a solution to this looming crisis. A solution based on free market principles allowing for consumer choice among competing plans offering different benefits. One prominent model for the reform of the Medicare program, recommended by Heritage scholars, is the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), the system that currently serves 1.6 million retired Members of Congress and federal workers.
<p>
<br>
<h3>Planning and Price Controls</h3>
<p>
While federal government officials have not been successful in accurately projecting the true costs of the Medicare program, they have had even less success in controlling them. Government bureaucrats have embarked on a quest to find the "right price" for thousands of different medical procedures and treatments or specialists and other providers. In some instances, Medicare pays doctors and hospitals and other health care "providers" too much; in other cases, "too little." Such a system encourages doctors and hospitals and other medical "providers" to engage in more or less elaborate attempts to "game" the price control system. Given its current structure, taxpayers should not be surprised that Medicarecannot control costs. The incentives of the current Medicare system conspire to drive costs up.
<p>
Just how expensive will it be to fund Medicare fully under the current system? The 1995 Medicare Trustees (a federal government board) Report provides some sobering information on how payroll taxes (which finance the HI program) would have to rise to keep the program afloat without reform. "To bring the HI program into actuarial balance even for the first 25 years," a new 1.3 percent payroll tax would have to be added to the current 2.9 percent Medicare payroll tax. Based on the trustees' estimates for revenues under the current tax rate, this would raise payroll taxesand hence the cost of employing Americansby an estimated $263 billion over five years and $388 billion over seven years. A worker earning $45,000 would have to pay an additional payroll tax of $585 per year. To achieve long-term actuarial balance of the HI trust fund without reforming the programthat is, to put it on a permanently sound footingan immediate additional payroll tax of 3.52 percent would need to be levied on top of today's 2.9 percent rate. That would raise taxes by $711 billion over five years and $1.050 trillion over seven years. The payroll taxes of a worker earning $45,000 would increase by $1,584 per year.
<p><br>
<h3>A New Model</h3>
<p>If Members of Congress want to retain the single payer, government-run structure of the Medicare program, then they must resort to either much higher taxes or even more draconian controls on doctors and hospitals, including a direct limitation of available services, in a fashion not unlike the British National Health Service.
<p>
If private employer-based insurance is not the best model for the reform of the Medicare system, Members of Congress can always examine their own system, the popular Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). This is the option proposed by The Heritage Foundation as a model for reform. It is also the model now proposed by the American Medical Association (AMA). 
Unlike Medicare, congressional and federal retirees do not have a government standardized benefits package imposed on them with the FEHBP program, but can pick and choose from a wide variety of plans and options. Medicare, on the other hand, offers almost no meaningful choices. And, in terms of economic efficiency, Medicare's bureaucratic and highly centralized system cannot even begin to compete with the market-based system that currently covers retired Members of Congress and federal employees.
<p>
While Medicare costs have been rising almost 11 percent per year, this year's overall private sector costs rose just 4.4 percent and FEHBP premiums costs actually declined by 3.3 percent. Since the free market forces have proven to work well for Members of Congress and retired Members of Congress, there is no reason why the FEHBP model can't work for our nation's elderly.

Book Review: Martin Malia: The Soviet Tragedy
 -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<h2>August <i>Insider</i> -- In Focus: Book Review</h2>
<I>by Elizabeth Edwards Spalding</i>
<hr>
<b>
The Soviet Tragedy: A History of Socialism in Russia, 1917-1991<br>
Martin Malia (New York: The Free Press, 1994)</b>
<p>
While good books on American history and domestic politics continue to multiply, the same cannot be said of international politics and American foreign policy. For those who are interested in the central conflict of the twentieth century -- the Cold War -- there is good news in the form of Martin Malia's The Soviet Tragedy. A respected, former professor of history at Berkeley, Malia may be best known as Z, the author who exposed the distortions of revisionist Sovietologists and analyzed the potential for the crumbling of the Soviet regime in his 1990 article "To the Stalin Mausoleum." Now Malia offers a masterful study of Western Sovietology and its translations of the Soviet regime and its practices.
<p>
Two models have dominated the field of Soviet studies: first, the totalitarian school that was pioneered in the 1950s, which argued that the Bolshevik revolution was communist and imposed in fact by an intellectual elite and that Lenin and Stalin established and extended a totalitarian state; second, the anti-totalitarian school, which, as it gained momentum in the 1960s and 1970s, maintained that pluralism, consensus building, and compromise characterized the Soviet Union, Lenin, and Stalin's successors. The revisionist anti-totalitarian model has influenced several generations of scholars, students, journalists, and policymakers, many of whom continue to contend that the Cold War ended with Stalin or, certainly, under Khrushchev. They foresaw and generally applauded a convergence between democracy and socialism, and they adduced dtente under Brezhnev as evidence. In this view, Ronald Reagan caused a second Cold War, and Mikhail Gorbachev deserved every accolade as man of the decade. Noteworthy exceptions to revisionism --such as Robert Conquest, Richard Pipes, and Malia-- constitute a pilloried minority.<P255D>
<p>
According to Malia, the totalitarian model is more correct than the anti-totalitarian model. To qualify as a totalitarian dictatorship, the classic definition requires an elaborate ideology, a single mass party, terror, a technologically conditioned monopoly of communication, a monopoly of weapons, and a centrally controlled economy. Malia never disputes the totalitarian nature of the Soviet system. But he qualifies his approval of the totalitarian model, since the rigidity of this model does not explain well "the obvious mellowing of the Soviet system in the decades after Stalin's death."
<p>
Malia suggests that Eastern European intellectuals, such as Poland's Adam Michnik, and other survivors of communism supply the deficiencies of the totalitarian model. Eastern Europeans applied totalitarian to a regime in which total control was the basic aspiration, while realizing that such a regime did not have to (and could not) exercise total control over its population. Explains Malia: "It did not mean that such regimes were omnipotent in performance, but rather that they were omnicompetent in their institutional structure. In short, it was not Soviet society that was totalitarian; rather, it was the Soviet state." While seeing the whole of the totalitarian objective, it is possible to distinguish between the "high totalitarianism" of Stalin and the routine totalitarianism of Brezhnev.
<p>
Malia imparts a lucid history of Soviet domestic and foreign policies, which is especially detailed where newly released information bolsters his argument. Throughout his discussion, he threads a sophisticated analysis of the Hegelian and Marxist foundations to socialism. Academic or not, readers will benefit particularly from his assessments of 1939-1953, 1982-1988, and 1989-1991. Unlike most other Western Sovietologists, Malia grasps that the Cold War began in 1917, that the Soviet Union made great gains during World War II, and that the East-West conflict then hardened in the postwar era. He also verifies the impact of Reagan's policies on the USSR, including SDI as a "technological and economic challenge the Soviets could neither ignore nor match." To explain the death throws of the USSR, Malia draws the important distinction between the profound and proximate causes of the great crash of 1989-1991. He does not make the mistake of attributing the demise of the USSR only to internal economic factors; rather, he assays that economic decline and its discrediting of ideology are the most important proximate causes. It is crucial to see these proximate causes of the Soviet collapse as "parts of a pattern arising from the nature of that system itself." As Malia concludes, socialism was founded on the profound Myth of radical egalitarianism and then transformed into the Lie: "In sum, there is no such thing as socialism, and the Soviet Union built it."
<p>
For those not embroiled in the ongoing academic warfare over the Cold War, Malia's points may seem manifest. The documents that are now available vindicate his position. To date, however, Malia's book --with its combined understanding of the Soviet regime and its practices, its rise and fall, and its interpretersis unique in the study of the Cold War.

<i><h3>National Security and Foreign Policy</h3></i>
<p>
<b>Clinton's ABM Treaty Muddle,</b> by Kim R. Holmes and Baker Spring<br>
<i>Committee Brief No. 16</i>, The Heritage Foundation
<p> 
Heritage vice president Kim Holmes and policy analyst Baker Spring focus on the inconsistencies in the Clinton administration's approach to the ABM Treaty. This brief, presented to the Senate Armed Services Committee on July 7, suggests five steps to overcome the confusion in the administration's policies: 1) Recognize that maintaining the ability to confront, and if need be destroy, the means of attack that may be used against the American people, their territory, their forces overseas, and their vital interests, will be the cornerstone of strategic stability in the post-Cold War world; 2) Recognize that the distinction between strategic and theater defenses is an arbitrary one; 3) Recognize that missile defense is an indispensable part of an effective counterproliferation policy; 4) Seek a cooperative approach with Russia and others for transcending the ABM Treaty; and 5) Seek genuine cooperation with Congress regarding missile defense and the future of the ABM Treaty. Holmes and Spring maintain that these steps will resolve the contradictions in the President's approach to the ABM Treaty. 7 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

<b>The Mystery of Japanese Growth,</b> by Ramesh Ponnuru<br>
<i>Rochester Paper No. 4,</i> Centre for Policy Studies and American Enterprise Institute
<p>
Ramesh Ponnuru, a student at Princeton University, examines the cause of Japan's economic strength and why, according to the author, America and Europe falsely believe this strength threatens their own economies. Ponnuru writes, "Neither a concern about trade imbalances nor fear of Japan's potential to surpass the economic might of other nations justify the adoption of self-destructive policies by those nations. America and Europe should refrain from raising their drawbridges against Japanese commerce, setting targets for trade in specific sectors, or indeed for overall trade balances, or forcing Japan to cut its savings rate." The author argues that many critics of Japan falsely credit Japan's success with the interventionist policies of its government. Ponnuru unequivocally believes that, on balance, interventions in the Japanese marketplace have hindered rather than helped Japan's economy. 47 pp. CONTACT: Centre for Policy Studies, 52 Rochester Row, London SW1P 1JU, 071-828-1176.

<b>Soviet in Public, Azeri in Private: Gender, Islam, and Nationalism in Post-Soviet Azerbaijan,</b> by Nayereh Tohidi<br>
<i>Working Papers No. I-95-9,</i> Hoover Institution
<p>
Nayareh Tohidi, research fellow and visiting scholar at the Hoover Institution, focuses on the intersection of gender, state socialism, nationality, and religion in Soviet and post-Soviet republic of Azerbaijan. The interplay between the Soviet state policy towards the "national question" and the "woman question" is demonstrated in the Muslim Azerbaijani context. It shows that, although Muslim Azeri women have accomplished an impressive level of emancipation, their overall status remains flawed with contradictions and duality. Similar to women of several other countries in the Muslim world confronting colonial domination or semi-colonial intrusion, Azeri women's liberation has been held hostage to their assigned responsibility as the primary repositories of tradition, ethnic, and national identity. In conclusion, gender dynamics of recent changes and a new search for national identity in the ethnically contested and war-stricken context of newly independent Azerbaijan is briefly explored. 30 pp. CONTACT: Hoover Institution Press, Stanford University Press, Stanford, CA 94305-6010, 415/723-3373.

<b>Keeping America Great: Toward a New Foreign Policy Doctrine,</b> by Malcolm Wallop<br>
<i>Heritage Lecture Series No. 526,</i> The Heritage Foundation
<p>
Former Senator from Wyoming and distinguished fellow at The Heritage Foundation Malcolm Wallop describes, in his remarks to Heritage's Annual Board Meeting in San Diego, how America, since the Bush presidency, has allowed her role as world leader to slip away. Wallop describes the effects of the "utter vacuum of [foreign] policy." The administration's focus on the economy led to further cuts in the military and lack of policy definition, and Wallop states, "No great nation can remain great, free, and prosperous without strength, purpose, and courage. Today America has the latter, some of the former, and none of the middle." To reconcile this situation, Wallop names six essential components of a new doctrine: "First, the safety of the homeland is the paramount obligation. Second, America has an interest in a world at peace, if only for economic reasons. Third, we are a trading nation needing markets as well as access to supplies. Fourth, we are a communicating nation, and that means access to space. Fifth, we are a nation of travelers and scholars. Sixth, we are a nation of conscience and freedomnot to impose it, but surely to support it." 5 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

<b>Do Sanctions Work? Economic Sanctions as a Tool of US Foreign Policy</b>
<i>Conference Summary,</i> American Enterprise Institute
<p>
This summary provides the comments of two separate panels, the first entitles "SanctionsImportant or Ineffective Tool of Foreign Policy." Shaun Donnely, deputy assistant secretary for energy, sanctions, and commodities for the US Department of State, described sanctions as the answer to situations where diplomatic initiatives are insufficient, but military action is not justified. Julius Katz, president of Hills & Company, points out that sanctions, in their historical context, have rarely worked. Zalmay Khalilzad, director of the Program for Strategy, Defense and Force Structure for RAND Project AIR FORCE, clearly regards sanctions (including the embargo of military technology) as an important instrument foreign policy in the post-Cold War era. Richard Perle, resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute uses the reasons to support sanctions which had been presented by Shaun Donnely and argues that they are exactly the reasons to oppose sanctions. Perle suggests that the US resorts to sanctions rather than a military effort is when it is not prepared to "bear the costs of real and effective action." The second panel, "The Efficacy of SanctionsThe Iraq, Iran, and Cuba Cases" examines the results of sanctions in these three countries. Micheal Eisenstadt, military fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy; James Kinnear, former president and CEO of Texaco Inc.; and Otto Reich, director of the Brock Group offer their differing views. 8 pp. CONTACT: American Enterprise Institute, 1150 17th St., NW, Washington, DC 20036, 202/862-5800.

<b>Commerce, Infrastructure & Regulation</b>
<b>Fair Lending Enforcement: How the Government Micromanages Banking,</b> by David J. McPherson<br>
Washington Legal Foundation
<p>
David McPherson, a banking and real estate attorney, argues that the recent fair lending enforcement campaign by the Department of Justice sets a disturbing precedent of the executive branch legislating by consent decree. This monograph discusses the legal basis for the Department of Justice enforcement actions and describes how, by prosecuting lending institutions for alleged discriminatory lending practices and forcing these institutions into consent decrees, the Justice Department has gone far beyond what is required by the federal fair lending laws and has confused sound lending practices with racial discrimination. McPherson advocates the cessation of attempts by the Justice Department to micromanage lending institutions and the encouragement in careful and consistent regulation and voluntary fair lending compliance by the lending community. 41 pp. CONTACT: Washington Legal Foundation, 2009 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20036, 202/588-0302.

<b>The Menace of Regulation,</b> by Michal Tosovsky<br>
Klub Mediator
<p>
Michal Tosovsky, president of the Czech Government Office for Standards, Metrology and Testing, defines the problems of regulation, focusing on Czech legislation since 1989, developments in the European Union, and experience gained from over-regulation in the United States. Tosovsky cites examples of excessive Czech legislation in the last five years: the Trading Act, Construction Act, Act on Authorized Architects and Engineers, Consumer Protection Act, Act on Czech Business Inspection Bureau, and the Act on State Testing. This paper examines these pieces of legislation and demonstrates the precedent they set for future increased regulation. The author concludes by recommending improvement of private legal mechanisms, implementation of EU regulations, coordination of deregulation measures and increased private deregulation initiatives. 23 pp. CONTACT: Klub Mediator, Box 115, 110 01 Praha 1, CZECH REPUBLIC, 42 2/539 568.

<b>The Myths and Realities of Trade Deficits,</b> by Bryan T. Johnson<br>
<i>Backgrounder No. 1039</i>, The Heritage Foundation
<p>
Heritage policy analyst Bryan Johnson argues that the driving force behind the Clinton Administration's threat of trade sanctions against Japan and its other managed trade policies is a misguided belief that trade deficits are harmful to the economy. Johnson states that the administration's managed trade policies are based on a number of faulty assumptions and myths about trade deficits including: trade deficits are harmful and trade surpluses are beneficial; trade deficits cost jobs; Japan's prosperity is based on trade surpluses generated by managed trade policies; since the US is unable to sell some goods and services in Japan, their markets must be closed; and trade sanctions to redress imbalances will protect American jobs. Johnson challenges each of these assumptions and others, proving that trade retaliation, in most cases, has failed to open markets while costing American consumers billions in higher prices. 7 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

Warren and Jones point out that this represents a 3.3 percent real increase, even after adjusting for inflation. This report also predicts that staffing figures will reach a new peak in 1996132,000 regulators. Warren and Jones conclude that the Clinton budget for 1996 appears to ignore the public's desire for less regulation and the administration's talk of reinventing government and streamlining the regulatory system has yet to be translated into action. 36 pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington University, Campus Box 1208, St. Louis, MO 63130-4899, 314/935-5630.

<b>Trade Policy Ahead: Three Tracks and One Question,</b> by Ernest H. Preeg<br>
Center for Strategic and International Studies
<p>
Ernest Preeg, the William M. Scholl Chair in International Business at CSIS, asserts that the structure of world trade has changed fundamentally in three ways since the early 1980s: 1) international trade in goods and services has become increasingly related to the international flow of capital, technology, and laborthe factors of production; 2)national economies and corporate strategies are increasingly dependent on international markets due largely to information-based technological change; 3)the polarization of the global industrialization process into three regions (Western Europe, North America, and East Asia) has intensified, one-half of world trade now takes place within these three regions. Preeg demonstrates that the changed structure has been reinforced by another change in the international trading systemfrom a multilateral yet, according to the author, narrowly drawn GATT to a system of multilateral commitments, regional free trade agreements, and selective bilateral accords.<i> Trade Policy Ahead </i>poses the question of how to manage the three tracks in a consistent, mutually reinforcing way toward broadly established goals. Preeg writes, "The time is finally ripe to include international investment policy within the framework of the multilateral trading system . . . and a central objective should be to launch negotiations for expansion of the WTO to a WTIOa World Trade and Investment Organization." 75 pp. CONTACT: The Center for Strategic and International Studies, 1800 K St., NW, Suite 400, Washington, DC 20006, 202/887-0200.

<b>The Great Tax Debate: Making Sense of Competing Tax Plans,</b> by Raymond J. Keating<br>
Small Business Survival Foundation
<p>
Raymond Keating, chief economist for the Small Business Survival Foundation, evaluates the current tax system and the leading proposals for reformthe flat tax, national retail sales tax, consumed-income tax, and the value-added tax (VAT). Each tax plan is analyzed according to eight criteria: ability to promote economic growth, rate of capital taxation, inflation factor, clarity of the tax system, simplicity, limits to bureaucracy and intrusiveness, minimized incentives for tax avoidance, and limitations to government spending. Keating offers a simple scoring system, assigning one point for each criteria fulfilled, a half point for each partially met, and zero points for those not met at all. From highest to lowest, the plans scored as follows: flat tax, national retail sales tax, VAT, consumed income tax, and the current income tax. The author concludes by recommending reducing the size of the federal government substantially and moving to a low, flat income tax of 10 percent, with no taxation of capital gains, dividends, interest from savings, or business income. Keating ultimately suggests repealing the 16th Amendment and replacing the income tax with a nation retail sales tax of less than 10 percent. 38 pp. CONTACT: Small Business Survival Foundation, 1320 18th Street, NW, Suite 2000, Washington, DC 20036, 202/785-0238, fax 202/822-8118.

<b>A Citizen's Guide to the State Budget Mess: A Menu of 217 Proposals to Reduce State Government Spending,</b> by Tom McClintock<br>
<i>Briefings</i>, The Claremont Institute
<p>
Former California Assemblyman Tom McClintock presents 217 specific reductions that could be made in the 1995-1996 California budget. Total savings from these proposals, which include contracting out services, abolishing obsolete agencies and programs, controlling the growth of the bureaucracy, and operation reforms, amount to more that $11.7 billion, including $1.2 billion in proposals by the Legislative Analyst's Office in 64 items. This work breaks the budget down into ten areas, from state and consumer services to health and welfare to youth and adult corrections. The author identifies many of the smaller, less costly programs that often get "lost" in the process of compiling large budgets. The savings amount to 13 percent of all funds proposed to be spent in the Governor's budget, or 18 percent of General and Special Funds. These proposals would also eliminate $725 million in fees to California citizens. 51 pp. CONTACT: The Claremont Institute, 2012 H St., Suite 101, Sacramento, CA 95814, 916/446-7924.

<b>What To Do About Medicare,</b> Stuart M. Butler, Robert E. Moffitt, and John C. Liu<br>
<i>Backgrounder No. 1038</i>, The Heritage Foundation
<p>
Stuart Butler, vice president and director of domestic and economic policy studies, Bob Moffitt, deputy director of domestic policy studies, and John Liu, policy analyst, demonstrate that for the Medicare system to achieve long-term actuarial balance without reform, the trust fund would require an immediate payroll tax increase of 3.52 percent, which would raise taxes by $711 billion over the next five years. This increase would only fund the hospital program, not the fund for physicians' services. This paper suggests, "Instead of trying to tighten current controls on deregulation, the proper reform is to create a very different dynamic and set of incentives to drive the Medicare program. Specifically, the bureaucratic, standardized, command-and-control structure of today's Medicare must be replaced with consumer choice among competing plans offering different benefits." Butler, Moffit, and Liu recommend offering the a plan modeled after the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. The major difference between this and the current system is that the government would make a defined financial contribution to the plan of the retiree's choice, rather that reimbursing Washington-approved service according to a fee schedule. This paper concludes that if Congress fails to institute fundamental reform, either the elderly will be faced with a dramatic reduction in health service or working families will be forced to pay sharply higher payroll taxes. Reform would provide a new Medicare system based on consumer choice, with security for both today and tomorrow's retirees. 22 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

<b>Medical Savings Accounts: Answering the Critics</b>, by Michael Tanner<br>
<i>Policy Analysis No. 228</i>, Cato Institute
<p>
Michael Tanner, director of health and welfare studies at Cato, seeks to answer the concerns of the critics of consumer-based health care. Tanner addresses four questions often raised by those who oppose MSAs: claims that health care has become so complex that consumers are unable to make cost-conscious decisions about their treatment; claims that consumers will forgo necessary or preventative care to save money in their medical savings accounts; claims that MSAs would attract the healthy, while the sick remain in conventional insurance programs; and claims that MSAs are regressive, providing benefits primarily to the wealthy. This paper provides the information that supporters of MSAs require to rebut the arguments of those opposing reform. The author admits that MSAs are not perfect, but maintains that they represent a significant step toward solving the cost and access problems of our health care system. 18 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20001, 202/842-0200.

<b>The Private-Sector Health Care Revolution: How It's Controlling Costs Across Florida and America,</b> by Melanie S. Tammen<br>

<p>
James Madison Institute research associate Melanie Tammen reveals that, despite the failure of Medicare and Medicaid, Florida Governor Lawton Chiles and President Clinton continue to promote plans which will force more and more people into government-intermediated health care programs. This paper maintains that Chiles' Florida Health Security Plan would dramatically expand the scope of the state's 11 new regional purchasing alliances by having them sell government subsidized health plans to low and middle-income residents. Tammen recommends reforms that facilitate universal coverage and affordability in marketplace, rather than plans to provide universal coverage along with large, expensive, taxpayer-financed programs. Tammen encourages Florida legislators to oppose Florida's new health care bureaucracy, the Community Health Purchasing Alliances, and pursue measures to further development of private sector reform. 16 pp. CONTACT: The James Madison Institute for Public Policy Studies, P.O.

Allan Bruce and Sandra Hill, both of Glasgow Caledonian University, focus on how health care moneys are to be managed and acknowledge the conflict between the managerial and clinical goals of the National Health Service in Scotland. This paper surveys opinions and beliefs of health managers and doctors in the West of Scotland. Bruce and Hill demonstrate that future reforms will require the input of both managers and doctors, in order to define a common agenda. This work begins the process of discovering the views of doctors, managers, and consultants towards research, management, medical direction, clinical direction, and training and preparation of doctors for management.

<b>Government in Health Care: Lessons from the UK</b>, by W. Duncan Reekie<br>
The Smith Center for Private Enterprise Studies
<p>
Duncan Reekie, the Bradlow Professor of Business Economics at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, criticizes, as one who grew up under Britain's National Health Service (NHS), the Clinton administration's approach to health care. The proponents of NHS used the same arguments used by the Clintons, and the author investigates these arguments, revealing their flaws from 1948 and now. Reekie recognizes that the Clintons' plan is substantially different from the NHS and that most of the alternate plans in Congress are subject to market-based objections as well. The author discusses why he believes a Clinton health care program, like the NHS, would lead to a politicized health care system dominated by special interests, "fostering not trust but distrust between patient and physician." Reekie demonstrates that once a government-dominated health care system is in place, it is nearly impossible to abolish. This paper warns the American electorate of the perils of national health care and urges Americans to learn from the mistakes of the UK. 116 pp. CONTACT: The Smith Center for Private Enterprise Studies, School of Business and Economics, California State University, Hayward, CA 94542, 510/885-3275, or fax 510/885-4442.

The current<i> Critical Issues Bulletin </i>attempts to document the extent to which lines are being used as a means of adapting to the conflict between limited budgetary allocations and potentially unlimited demand for free health care in the Canadian health system. Ramsay and Walker compiled data based on the waiting time in hospitals across Canada. The results suggest, based on the increased waiting times and the increased concern of the government to continue to supply the norm of health care services, that waiting lists have become an alternative to rising prices by restraining health care expenses in a system where prices have been systematically eliminated and neither physicians nor patients have any economic incentive to consider the costs of their decisions. 50 pp. CONTACT: The Fraser Institute, 626 Bute St., Vancouver, BC, CANADA V6E 3MI, 604/688-0221.

<b>Welfare Reform: Allow Welfare to Wither So Charities Can Bloom,</b> by Stuart Anderson<br>
<i>Issue Brief</i>, The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution
<p>
Stuart Anderson, policy director at the Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, suggests that public policy analysts should pose two questions: in what areas are charitable organizations superior to the government in providing sevices to those less fortunate? and how can American society put more resources into the hands of charitable organizations to provide those services? This paper recommends that these decisions be made at a local level, and therefore the federal welfare system must give states flexibility to design their own approaches without interference from Washington. This study presents three significant findings: 1) the non-profit group Community for Creative Non-Violence spent $365,000 in 1992 to house 1400 homeless individuals on a nightly basis, while the DC government spent $26.4 million to house 2280 homeless people nightly in government shelters; 2) over a period of years, the city government paid the Pitts Hotel the $12.48 per person, per day for food, which amounted to 78 times the cost of three meals provided by the charity-run DC Central Kitchen (with donations and food purchased from local food banks, the DC Kitchen can serve meals at a cost of 16 cents per person.); and 3) advocates for the poor are restricted by regulations that  limit flexibility and creativity. 8 pp. CONTACT: The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, 2000 15th Street North, Suite 501, Arlington, VA 22201, 703/351-4969, or fax 703/351-0090.

Milton Friedman addresses the immediate need to reconstruct the education system at both the elementary and secondary levels to offset the growing wage differential crisis in the United States. He recommends privatizing a large segment of the school system, allowing for the creation of a for-profit education industry. This plan would offer effective competition to public schools by creating a free-market for choice in education. The system he proposes enables parents to select the schools their children attend by means of a universal voucher system that would be sufficient to cover the costs of a high-quality education. 7 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC 20001, 202/842-0200.

<p>
Allyson M. Tucker, policy council director at the National Policy Forum, and William F. Lauber aid to Representative Chris Cox (R-CA); both former Heritage Foundation analysts, report strong evidence that concludes that the school choice movement is gaining ground at the state level. Their argument originates from the strong results pro-school choice candidates had at the polls in the 1994 elections, indicating that 1995 could be the year that school choice legislation will make significant gains. Lisa Graham was elected for state superintendent of schools in Arizona, with 59 percent of the vote, on a platform centered on school choice. At the gubernatorial level, candidates such as George W. Bush of Texas, George Pataki of New York, and John Rowland of Connecticut won as advocates of school choice. Proponents of choice can also expect action from Congress in 1995. Debate is going on in both chambers on "how the federal government can help states implement choice." Discussion is expected to focus on using funds from Chapter One for vouchers. Chapter One is the largest federal aid program for poor elementary and secondary students. Other articles address the tax status of the NEA and deregulating schools. 3 pp. CONTACT: The Heartland Institute, 800 East Northwest Highway, Suite 1080, Palantine, IL 60067-6516, 708/202-3060, or fax 708/202-9799.

Marshall advocates the theory that parents, as opposed to government bureaucrats, are more able to select the schools their children attend based upon: the values they embrace, the teachers they employ, and the curriculum they uphold. The author also provides an in-depth section in his paper devoted to rebutting the attacks school choice opponents most commonly use to halt the movement. He debunks fifteen myths surrounding the school choice debate, including: 1) school choice is unconstitutional at state and local levels; 2) choice carries a heavy price tag; 3) school choice will wipe out the gains made in desegregation; and 4) choice will relegate poor children to the worst schools. 52 pp. CONTACT: Floridians for Educational Choice, P.O.

While debate continues on the educational benefits of returning control of education to state and local governments, Berthoud's paper makes the case for the potential cost savings of such decentralization. Terminating the department would eliminate the cost of maintaining a separate bureaucracy and the interest group pressures to increase spending. Alexis de Tocqueville Institution also reported the following findings: 1) eliminating the U.S. Department of Education would save taxpayers $15.7 billion dollars over a five-year period; 2) since education became the 12th cabinet department in 1979, the department's spending has risen three times as fast as the non-defense discretionary budget; and 3) taxpayers would have saved 5 billion dollars since 1979, if federal education spending had grown at the same rate as non-defense discretionary spending. 17pp. CONTACT: The Alexis de Tocqueville Institution, 2000 15th Street North, Suite 501, Arlington, VA 22201, 703/351-4969, or fax 703/351-0090.

As Congress attempts to repair the damage of Superfund legislation, Mahoney suggests Ten Points of Resolution: retroactive liability should be retained as in the current law; insurance issues should be left to settlement by the parties involved; joint and several liability would be replaced by proportionate liability; the highest priority is the completion of Superfund's Emergency Removal program; no new additions should be made to the Superfund NPL list during the life of the Emergency Removal program; Superfund sites should be divided into two categories, those where containment is satisfactory and those whose future use is yet undetermined or unlikely to be industrial; a substantial amount of Superfund moneys would be allocated to proposals to develop cost-effective, neighbor-friendly permanent remediation; communities should be empowered and funded for full participation in the Superfund Trust; minor participants at sites should be relieved from all future liability upon payment of a nominal share; and minority and/or poor communities would receive preferential priority. Mahoney suggests that these Ten Points of Resolution represent an outline for Superfund reform and provide a basis for tradeoffs among the various parties' interests. 9 pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington University, Campus Box 1208, St. Louis, MO 63130-4899, 314/935-5630.

<p>
K.H. Jones, president of Zephyr Consulting Company, and Jonathan Adler, associate director of environmental studies at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, argue that the national policy on the control of urban smog is misguided because it fails to account for current population trends and is based on the anomalous meteorological conditions of 1988. This paper describes how this is particularly important in the Ozone Transport Region, the 12 states from Virginia to Maryland. The regulatory programs being proposed resemble the low-emission vehicle standards in California. The authors write, "The sort of control for control's sake' pollution control strategies pursued by the EPA and the Ozone Transportation Commission are largely inappropriate because they are neither cost-effective nor equitable means of achieving emissions reductions, even should such reductions be necessary."

Wittman and Griffin write, "Taxpayer funding of advocacy groups is wrongfiscally, morally, and logically. It is fiscally irresponsible to spend federal revenues on activities that provide no meaningful return to the people. And it is logically wrong for the government to fund activities that often result in lobbying for increased federal expenditures."

Defenders of Property Rights has come to the aid of Pennsylvania farmer Bob Brace, who is being prosecuted by the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. He has been accused of violating federal wetlands statutes. Defenders has filed an amicus brief in support of Mr. Brace's petition to have his case heard by the U.S. Supreme Court. The government claims Brace violated Section 404(f) of the Clean Water Act when he upgraded his farm's drainage system in 1977. This improvement, which allowed him to farm thirty acres of land that was previously useful for little more than pasture, was cited as an unpermitted discharge of fill. The EPA ordered him to remove the drainage system to allow the land to return to its alleged "natural state" as a wetland. Failure to do so could subject him to fines as high as $25,000 a day.
Mr. Brace contends his changes to the property are permitted by the Clean Water Act. Section 404(f) states that discharge permits are not required for "normal farming activity," specifically stating "the maintenance of drainage ditches...is not prohibited by or otherwise subject to regulation under this section."<br>
Brace can expect word from the high court as to whether whey will hear his case sometime this fall.

<b>Rhode Island's Interference with Consumer Choice</b><br>
The Institute filed an<i> amicus</i> brief in the pending U.S. Supreme Court case, <i>44 Liquormart v. State of Rhode Island.</i> This commercial speech case concerns a challenge to Rhode Island's prohibition on advertising the price of alcoholic beverages. The Institute's brief critiques the prohibition from the perspective of the ultimate beneficiary of commercial information: the consumer. Drawing on the works of Hayek, Friedman, and Stigler, the brief also documents the essential role of price information and advertising in a market economy. The brief concludes by arguing that commercial speech should be granted full constitutional protection.

<b>New Jersey Reform Confronts Another Hurdle After Big Victory</b><br>
The Legal Services Corporation of New Jersey has filed an appeal in response to a federal district court ruling, on March 4, in favor of the state's family cap welfare reform experiment. The Institute will continue to defend New Jersey's plan in the third circuit.<br>
The lawsuit in 1993 by Legal Services of New Jersey and others had asked the judge to block the cap and vacate the federal waiver that permitted it, on the ground that the federal waiver was unlawful and the reform violated procedural and constitutional rights. The Institute filed an<i> amicus</i> brief on behalf of American Legislative Exchange Council, Independent Women's Forum, The Empowerment Network, and five New Jersey AFDC recipients; and played an activist role in defending the program.

<b>Landmark Files Academic Freedom Case Against University of Kansas</b><br>
Former University of Kansas Law School professor Emil A. Tonkovich is suing the University for pursuing a politically correct agenda designed to discredit the professor, a political and philosophical conservative. Landmark Legal Foundation is representing Professor Tonkovich, who was fired for allegedly sexually harassing a student.<br>
The controversy began I May of 1991, when a female student initially accused Tonkovich of making "a pass" at her following a school party three years ago. He has vehemently denied the charge. Several months later, this accusation mushroomed into an allegation of sex and sexual harassment. The allegation was uncorroborated and was contradicted by other female students.
"The widespread use of smear tactics to drive politically incorrect professors off campuses poses a dangerous threat to academic freedom in this country," said Landmark President Jerald L. Hill. "This lawsuit will help send the message that conservative professors will not be silenced."<br>

<b>New England Legal Foundation</b><br>
Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court Strikes Down Scheme that Raised Utility Costs
In a case in which the New England Legal Foundation filed a friend of the court brief, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court struck down an ordinance enacted by the city of Somerville which required utilities to pay a single contractor chosen by the city to do all excavation and paving work on city streets. The chosen contractor had used its government-created monopoly to charge utilities twice the rate it charged for such work in neighboring towns.<br>
The "City Contract Representative" was chosen by the city but paid by any utility that had to do street work. Bid specifications were so narrowly drawn that only one contractor qualified for the job. Utilities which refused to use the Representative were denied needed permits. The Representative had no incentive to work quickly nor, because its pay is based on the amount of asphalt used, efficiently. Because the city instructed the Representative to put the street into better condition than it was before being opened, it was able to make utilities and, ultimately, their customers pay for routine street work.<br>
An <i>amicus  </i>brief filed by NELF argued that the Somerville ordinance was not only unwise but that it exceeded the city's legal authority to maintain public streets and conflicted with state's supervisory power over utility regulation. In effect, NELF argued, Somerville had imposed an unauthorized and illegal tax on all utility customers. The Supreme Judicial Court has now agreed.

<b>NELF to File Brief in Connecticut Trespasser Tort Case</b><br>
In Hartford, Connecticut, a thief decided to steal from what appeared to be an abandoned electric switchbox, despite bold-faced warning signs posted in English and Spanish. When the thief was shocked and seriously injured, he sued the utility, claiming that it should have taken more care to protect potential thieves from possible injuries. A Superior Court judge in Connecticut threw out the case; the thief is appealing.<br>
NELF will file an<i> amicus </i>brief supporting the lower court. In this case, as in other recent Rhode Island and Vermont cases, NELF will argue that the traditional common law rule, that landowners are not obliged to spend money making their property safe for trespassers, is both good and sound public policy. Furthermore, NELF will argue that a state PUC rule, which requires utilities to take reasonable precautions to ensure that consumers and others are not endangered by company equipment, did not require anything more than the clear and visible warnings which the company did post.<br>

<b>Fighting Against Government Extortion</b><br>
<i>Ehrlich v. City of Culver City.</i> In June, PLF filed a friend of the court brief in the California Supreme Court in one of the most important "regulatory takings" cases to come before the state justices in 17 years. Since 1992, PLF has been supporting Richard Ehrlich's attempt to invalidate "mitigating" fees imposed on him as a condition for receiving a permit to construct a housing development.<br>
For several years, Mr. Ehrlich operated a private tennis club but was unable to make a financial success of it. In 1988, he closed the facility and donated most of the movable equipment to the city and proposed a town-house condominium project on the property. The City Council approved the building project on the condition that Mr. Ehrlich pay $280,000, which the city estimated was the cost of building replacement tennis courts.<br>
PLF contends that the fee is unconstitutional because it fails the rough proportionality test laid down last June by the U.S. Supreme Court in<i> Dolan v. City of Tigard.</i> In<i> Dolan,</i> The Supreme Court invalidated a condition by the City of Tigard, Oregon, that a landowner give 10% of her property for public use in exchange for a permit to expand her plumbing supply store. Such conditions for a permit are justifiable only if local officials can show that there is a reasonable connection or essential "nexus" between the conditions and any harm caused by the project being permitted. The extent of the exaction must also be "roughly proportional" to the project's impact on the community.<br>
PLF helped Mr. Ehrlich win an order from the U.S. Supreme Court that 1) vacated a Court of Appeal ruling upholding the city's fees, and 2) sent the case back to the appellate court with instructions to reconsider in light of the <i>Dolan</i> decision. The Court of Appeal affirmed that development fees must meet the high level of scrutiny required by <i>Dolan.</i> Unfortunately, it misapplied the<i> Dolan </i>test to the facts of this case and held that the fee was related to the impacts caused by a change in land use designation needed for the construction of the condominiums.<br>
PLF also will assist Mr. Ehrlich's attorney in preparing for oral argument before the state Supreme Court.
<p>
<b>U.S. Supreme Court Strikes Down Congressional Ballot Access Restrictions</b><br>
<i>U.S. Term Limits v. Thorton.</i> In a major setback for term limit proponents, the U.S. Supreme Court held on May 22, that voter-enacted ballot access restrictions on members of Congress are unconstitutional. In a 5-to-4 ruling, the Justices held that the qualifications for congressional services set forth in the Constitution are "fixed" in that they may not be supplemented by Congress or the states. PLF, on behalf of Citizens for Term Limits filed friend of the court briefs in the case urging the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case and arguing in support of Arkansas' ballot access measure, Amendment 73.<br>
Amendment 73, an amendment to Arkansas' constitution, prohibited the name of an otherwise eligible candidate for Congress form appearing on the general election ballot if that candidate had already served three terms in the House of Representatives or two terms in the Senate. That person could run as a write-in candidate, however. PLF attorneys argued, among other things, that the U.S. Constitution permits states to regulate the "time, place, and manner" of elections. They asserted that measures like Amendment 73 do not bar anyone from running for office, but only restrict ballot access in certain circumstances.<br>
The High Court ruled that the Constitution is the exclusive source of qualifications for members of Congress and that states may not add qualifications. Even though Amendment 73 allows congressional candidates to run as "write-in" candidates and serve if elected, the Court nevertheless considered this to be an indirect attempt at evading the Qualifications Clause's requirements.
The ruling has absolutely nothing to do with term limits on state officeholders. But according to recent news stories some term limit opponents are claiming the decision may open the door to a renewed challenge to term limits imposed on state legislators and constitutional officers. PLF successfully represented the proponents of California's Proposition 140 (state term limits) before the California and United Sates Supreme Courts. Any attempt to relitigate and overturn that settled victory will be met by a forceful defense by PLF attorneys.

<b>Important Rent Control Victory in New York Upheld</b><br>
<i>Manocherian v. Lenox Hill Hospital</i>. Late May, the U.S. Supreme Court denied review and let stand a key property rights decision by New York's highest court. Last October, the New York Court of Appeals struck down a provision of the state's rent control law relating to the subleasing of rent-stabilized apartments as applied to nonprofit hospitals. PLF filed a friend of the court brief in support of the property owner.<br>
Lenox Hill Hospital leases rent-stabilized apartments in New York and subleases them to its nurses as an employee benefit. Ten years ago, Lenox Hill Secured passage of a law that required apartment owners who lease apartments to the hospital to offer lease renewals directly to Lenox Hill rather than to the individual nurses who occupy the apartments. Because Lenox Hill has a perpetual corporate existence, this law has the effect of denying the owners any expectation of being able to reoccupy their property, as they could if their primary tenant was a natural person. <br>
New York's highest court declared the law to be unconstitutional for "not substantially advancing a closely and legitimately connected State interest."<br>
In its majority opinion, the Court of Appeals returned again and again to <i>Nollan's </i>requirement that property regulations be closely related to the advancement of a legitimate governmental interest. <i>Nollan </i>and other recent Supreme Court cases are seen to lay down "a constitutional minimum floor of protection which this Court lacks authority to diminish under the Supremacy Clause."<br>

<b>ACLU Sues School for Making Bibles Available to Students</b><br>
The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued the Upshur County Board of Education and Superintendent Lynn Westfall because they agreed to allow a citizen group to place a box of free Bibles for students on school property. The Rutherford Institute represented the school board and the superintendent in the case tried before U.S. District Court Judge Irene M. Keeley.<br>
The case began on Dec. 6, 1994 when the school board voted to permit a citizen group comprised of local businesses to place boxes of Bibles in the Upshur County Public Schools on Feb. 27, 1995, for students to pick up on a voluntary basis. As a result, on Feb. 23, 1995, the ACLU on behalf of several parents, sued the school and obtained an order forbidding the school from permitting anyone to make Bibles available to students while the case was pending.<br>
The Rutherford Institute asked the court to recognize that a public school's decision to permit outside groups to make free written materials available to students does not violate the Establishment Clause merely because the outside group chooses the Bible as the material to make available.

<b>Red Cross Retracts Attack on Religious Freedom Law</b><br>
The Red Cross has amended its motion to dismiss a religious discrimination case against it to exclude its prior argument that the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) is unconstitutional. The Red Cross had included this argument in its April 1995 motion to dismiss the lawsuit filed against it in Federal District Court by Herbert Hall, A Rutherford Institute client denied Red Cross instructor certification in a government funded AIDS awareness program because he is involved in a Christian ministry.<br>
Because Hall was denied instructor certification in February 1993, The Rutherford Institute filed a complaint in February 1995 against the Red Cross in the Central District Court of California. In response, the Red Cross moved to dismiss the case, stating that RFRA is unconstitutional.

<b>Valedictorian to Deliver Religious Speech at Graduation</b><br>
DeSoto, Texas, May 22, 1995--Late yesterday, the DeSoto Independent School District agreed to allow valedictorian Shannon Leigh Welch to deliver an unedited graduation speech containing references to God and to religion. Gregory P. Gorman, a participating attorney with The Rutherford Institute, represented Welch. <br>
On May 18, 1995, Welch submitted her speech to the school's English Department for grammatical editing. As a result, school officials informed Welch that school policy required her to remove religious references and the words "God" and "Jesus Christ" from her speech. School officials also advised Welch to rewrite her speech.<br>
The Rutherford Institute, on May 21, 1995, hand delivered opinion letters to the school board, superintendent and principal, informing them that they were violating Welch's constitutionally guaranteed free speech rights by forcing her to remove religious references from her speech. In response, the school district reversed its position.

<b>WLF Assists Texas in Death Penalty Case</b><br>
At the request of the Texas Attorney General's Office, WLF filed a brief in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas supporting the state's effort to carry out the death sentence imposed on a murderer who argued, in a <i>habeas corpus</i> petition, that it would be cruel and unusual punishment to execute him after his 12 years on death row. WLF's brief in the case, <i>Lackey v. Scott,</i> pointed out that his argument has no basis in the text of history of the Eight Amendment and that the inmate himself is responsible for creating the delay by availing himself of state and federal review procedures.
<p>
<b>Federal Court Asked to Dismiss Suit on "Three-Fifths" Rule for Tax Votes</b><br>
WLF filed a brief on behalf of itself and 22 Members of Congress urging the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to dismiss <i>Skaggs v. Carle, </i>a suit filed by Democratic Members of Congress to invalidate new House Rules that would make it more difficult for Congress to raise taxes. House Rule XXI (c)requires a three-fifths vote to raise taxes, and House Rule XXI (d) prohibits consideration of retroactive tax increases. WLF argued that the case is not justifiable and that each House of Congress has the power to set the rules of its own proceedings. WLF further pointed out that by the plaintiffs' reasoning, numerous long-standing congressional rules and practices would also be unconstitutional, including the Senate's cloture rule.
<p>
<b>WLF Supports Landowner in Fight Against Confiscatory Regulation</b><br> 
In <i>Ehrlich v. Culver, </i>WLF urged the Supreme Court of California to reverse a lower court decision that allowed a city to require a developer to pay for the construction of public tennis courts as a condition for letting the developer erect townhomes on his property. The city argues that because the developer was closing his private tennis club, the city needed money from him to replace his tennis courts. WLF argues that the U.S. Supreme Court's decision last year in<i> Dolan v. City of Tigard </i>allows a municipality to consider only the future effects of a development in assessing development exactions, not the property's prior use.<br>

Whitburn.</i> Under benefits for the first six months of their Wisconsin residence as if they were in their former state. WLF's brief opposes the suit brought by Legal Action of Wisconsin, which claims that the program violates the recipients' constitutional right to travel and that federal statutory and regulatory requirements governing research experiments on human subjects require Wisconsin to obtain the consent of all welfare recipients who are affected by the program.

<b>Constitutionality of "Official English" Defended in Ninth Circuit</b><br>
In <i>Yniguez v. State of Arizona, WLF </i>filed a brief on behalf of itself and the Center for Equal Opportunity in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in support of Arizona's "Official English" 1988 ballot measure, which amended the Arizona Constitution to require that the state and local governments of Arizona must act in English (with exceptions to protect public health or safety, to protect the rights of crime victims or criminal defendants, or to comply with federal law, such as federal requirements that mandate bilingual education). Following passage of the measure, Arizona was sued by a state employee who claimed she has a First Amendment right to continue to practice conversing with Spanish-speaking malpractice claimants in Spanish and to continue filling out release-of claim forms in Spanish--a language that her supervisor did not understand, leaving him unable to review the forms. WLF's brief was filed before the Ninth Circuit sitting en banc, which will review the panel decision that accepted the employee's position and struck down the amendment in its entirety.<br>

<p><b>Retreat or Reform? Russia's Struggle for Democracy,</b> by Robert Halfon<br>
<i>Occasional Paper No. 62,</I> Institute for European Defence and Strategic Studies
<p>Robert Halfon, director of research at Market Access International, a leading public affairs consultancy in the UK, points out that the re-emergence of hardline communism as a significant political force is a matter of great concern. He suggests that the real danger lies in the way in which Vladimir Zhirinovsky and his Liberal Democratic party justify Russian "sabre-rattling" in Iraq and the former Yugoslavia, for the purpose of intimidating the West into accepting policies which may prove detrimental to its interests. Halfon cites the military-industrial complex and the former KGB leaders as other areas where communists still present an obstacle to liberalization. Therefore, the author concludes, western democracies have a crucial role to play in identifying and promoting Russian democratic groups and leaders and encouraging their political programs. 50 pp. CONTACT: The Institute for European Defence and Strategic Studies, St. George's House, 14/17 Wells Street, London, ENGLAND, W1P 3FP, 0171/637-2152, or fax 0171/637-2155.

<p>Philip Gold, a Discovery Institute Senior Fellow and director of their Aerospace 2010 project, analyzes the spending habits of the military establishment since the end of the Cold War. This paper questions the ability of the military to deal effectively with the New World disorder, in light of recent cutbacks. Gold also explores why increased spending will be necessary in certain technological areas. The author argues that, in the long run, the proper course is not to spend more but to spend more wisely.

<p><b>The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act: Helping to Create a Free and Prosperous Cuba,</b> by Bryan T. Johnson<br>
<i>Issue Bulletin No. 208,</i> The Heritage Foundation
<p>Policy Analyst Bryan Johnson examines the possible effects of the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity Act, which is currently before the Senate. He encourages the Senate to take this opportunity to strengthen the bill which passed the House by including several measures: 1) strengthen the provision prohibiting international financial institutions from providing loans and guarantees to Castro's Cuba; 2) create a provision designating as a hostile act any move by Castro to unleash a mass exodus of illegal emigrants; 3) restore Cuba's share of US sugar import quotas to near its 1958 level once Castro is gone and a democratic transition government is in place; 4) eliminate language authorizing the President to provide government-subsidized financing and other programs to a post-Castro Cuba; 5) direct the President to seek a free trade area agreement with a post-Castro Cuba; and 6) require that the President begin processing the 25,000 refugees at Guantanamo for controlled entry into the US. Johnson proposes that these measures will tighten the existing embargo and help end Castro's 40 year nightmare in Cuba. 10 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

<p><b>NATO and US Interests, </b>by W. Bruce Weinrod<br>
<i>Commonsense, Vol. 2 No. 1,</i> National Policy Forum
<p>W. Bruce Weinrod, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for European and NATO Policy in the Bush administration, outlines and addresses the serious questions being raised about the relevance and future of NATO. As the United States and its European allies enter a new era in international politics, NATO must decide how its role and membership reflect this new era. Weinrod writes, "The best way for NATO to help assure a Europe 'whole and free' is to bring the democratic nations of Europe closer to NATO, with the objective of making them members." In order to clarify these decisions for NATO, the US must first clarify many of the foggy points of its own foreign policy, and the current administration must be willing to exert its leadership over this process. 13 pp. CONTACT: National Policy Forum, 229<P8M><$E1/2><P255D> Pennsylvania Ave., SE, Washington, DC 20003, 202/544-2900.

<p><b>Do We Need the IMF and the World Bank?,</b> by Sir Alan Walters<br>
<i>Current Controversies No. 10,</i> The Institute of Economic Affairs
<p>Before embarking on any new initiatives for either the IMF or the World Bank, Walters suggests, these two powerful institutions are overdue for a performance re-examination. Walters, having formerly served as an economic advisor to the Prime Minister, points out that attempts to downsize the Fund and the Bank always end up making them larger. The author also acknowledges that both institutions, besides outgrowing their original purposes, have become increasingly political particularly in the case of Russia, where normal conditions have been relaxed. Walters concludes, "ideally the Bank and the Fund should be abolished. If central banks want a central bankers' bank they (not governments) should control it."

<p><b>About-Turn in Hungarian Foreign Policy,1990-1994, </b>by Ivn Bba<br>
<i>Occasional Paper No. 2,</i> Windsor Klub
<p>Once known as the Happiest Barracks in the Camp, Hungary did more than any other ex-Warsaw Pact state after 1989 to undo the legacy of the international order created by the Cold War. Guided by the statesmanlike vision of Prime Minister Jzsef Antall, Hungarian foreign policy between 1990 and 1994 consistently pursued the aims of Euro-Atlantic integration and regional co-operation. Despite the break-up of no less than three neighboring countries (Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and the Soviet Union), Hungary remained an important source of stability and pro-Western resolve. In this study, the deputy state secretary at the foreign ministry for these years assesses the successes and failures of his country's policies and considers the impact that last year's electoral victory by the Socialist Party will have on Hungary's acceding to such institutions as NATO and the EU. 29 pp. CONTACT: Johnathan Sunley, Windsor Klub, Falk Miksa utca 12.I.1a, Budapest 1055, HUNGARY, 361/112-3701

<p><b>The Minimum Wage: No Way to Help the Poor,</b> by Deepak Lal<br>
<i>Occasional Paper 95,</i> The Institute of Economic Affairs
<p>Deepak Lal, a professor of International Development Studies at UCLA, examines the controversy among economists about the effects of a minimum wage. Despite the many recent studies which apparently support the views of politicians in Britain and the US, minimum wages would have widespread effects on labor markets: they would, for example, reduce human capital formations because they would compress the wage structure and undermine incentives to acquire skills. Thus, support for a minimum wage is "at odds with the desire to promote skill accumulation by unskilled workers particularly the young and females. The author suggests that those who fear a situation where workers do not properly market their skills should still be wary of the minimum wage since "there is not obvious technocratic solution which would be better than that discovered by the market." 38 pp. CONTACT: Institute of Economic Affairs, 2 Lord North St., London, England  SW1P 3LB, 071/799-3745.

National Institute for Labor Relations Research
<p>James Bennett's study reveals that residents of Right-to-Work states have higher real incomes on average than the residents of states where workers are forced to pay union dues. In his report Bennett shows that after adjusting for state and local taxes and inflation, the average family in a Right-to-Work state has $2,852 more in purchasing power than a family in a forced-unionism state. The author writes, "In states without Right-to-Work laws high taxes and the high cost of living erode the purchasing power of income so much that families in states with Right-to-Work laws are, on average, better off."

<p><b>The Urgent Need to Finish Farm Trade Reform,</b> by Thomas J. Duesterberg<br>
<i>Hudson Briefing Paper No. 177,</i> Hudson Institute 
<p>Senior Fellow and Director of the Competitiveness Center Thomas Duesterberg demonstrates that the developing world is experiencing a tremendous growth in demand for bulk foodstuffs and processed foods, as the economies of these countries continue to prosper. Duesterberg forecasts that the US agricultural industry is one of the few in the world that can meet this growing demand in an environmentally friendly way. Despite considerable obstacles in much of the developing world including outright bans on many Asian countries, severe restraints, and high tariffs US agricultural exports achieved record sales in 1994. This paper concludes that the US, in order to take advantage of the coming increase in worldwide food demand, must unshackle US producers, and US trade negotiators must take aggressive steps to remove barriers to worldwide trade in bulk and processed agricultural products. 12 pp. CONTACT: Hudson Institute, Herman Kahn Center, P.O.

<b><p>Jobs, Growth, Freedom and Fairness: Why America Needs a Flat Tax,</b> by Daniel J. Mitchell<br>
<i>Backgrounder No. 1035,</i> The Heritage Foundation
<p>The Armey flat tax proposal has been wildly popular with American taxpayers, not only due to its simplicity but also because of its fairness and potential for producing economic growth. But many taxpayers are not aware of other positive effects of the flat tax: 1) the flat tax would boost national wealth by $1 trillion, since investments would be guided by profitability rather than tax status. 2) a flat tax would treat people equally, no longer penalizing taxpayers based on success or income. 3) Armey's plan would end micromanagement and political favoritism, ridding the tax code of all deduction, loopholes, credits, and special preferences. 4) the flat tax would increase civil liberties by increasing the rights of a taxpayer under IRS investigation. 5) the flat tax would increase tax collections from the wealthy, since the proposal includes incentives to earn and report taxable income. Mitchell concludes that the most important benefit from the flat tax proposal is the reduction of the power of the federal government in taxpayers' lives and businesses. 35 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

<p>Director of Economic Research Alan Reynolds demonstrates why the capital gains tax is an extremely inefficient method of raising revenue. Reynolds claims that  the capital gains tax is easy to avoid, and reporting and monitoring costs are high. The paper reveals that an even worse effect is that the tax decreases the market value of investments and real estate and hinders the economy's allocation of capital assets to their most effective uses.

<p><b>Why You Can't Trust the IRS,</b> by Daniel J. Pilla<br>
Policy Analysis No. 222, Cato Institute
<p>Daniel Pilla, a tax litigation consultant, forecasts that some 40 million Americans will have had an adversarial confrontation with the IRS by the end of this year. In a rising number of cases, the taxpayer is right, and the IRS is wrong. This study finds that despite a doubling of its budget over the past 10 years and a nearly 20 percent increase in enforcement personnel, the IRS is increasingly incapable of administering and enforcing the nation's tax law. This report cites several reasons the IRS can no longer be trusted, including: 1) the IRS telephone taxpayer assistance program provides about 8.5 million Americans the wrong answers to even the most basic inquiries about tax laws; 2) this year roughly 10 million Americans will receive correction notices from the IRS assessing about $4 billion in fines and penalties about half of these notices will be wrong; 3) about 40 percent of the revenues the IRS collects through penalty assessments are abated when citizens challenge the penalties in 1993 taxpayers were overcharged $5 billion; and 4) a General Accounting Office audit of the IRS in 1993 found widespread evidence of financial malfeasance and gross negligence; the IRS could not account for 64 percent of its congressional appropriation. Pilla reasons that since the IRS fails to meet the standards of financial accountability that it imposes on the citizenry, it can no longer be trusted with the authority to police American businesses and taxpayers. 32 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Ave., NW, Washington, DC  20001, 202/842-0200.

<p><b>The Coming Taxpayer Bailout of Social Security,</b> by Gary and Aldona Robbins<br>
<i>IPI Policy Report No. 130,</i> The Institute for Policy Innovation
<p>This study argues that the disappearance of the Social Security Trust fund is due to two factors. First, the US economy has performed more poorly than expected. The last recession, combined with expectations of slower future growth, has caused almost one-quarter of the payroll tax base to evaporate. Second, the Social Security program is making promises it cannot keep, committing to replacing about 42 percent of the average worker's salary in retirement, as contrasted with the one-third of salary replacement promised during Social Security's first three decades. Meanwhile, Medicare benefits are also growing at an even more alarming rate. The authors point out that the revenues necessary to support this rapid growth in Social Security and Medicare will claim almost 15 percent of the US economy within the next 35 years, giving the federal government even greater control over the productive resources of Americans than it already has. The report states that the only way to secure the retirement of the baby boomers is to boost US economic growth and slow the rate of benefit growth. 24 pp. CONTACT: The Institute for Policy Innovation, 25 South Stemmons, Suite 306, Lewisville, TX  75057, 214/219-0811.

<p><b>The Pension Funds Bail-Out: The Biggest Boondoggle Ever,</B> by Steven Plaut<br>
<i>Policy View No. 12,</i> The Shalem Center
<p>Plaut, a professor of Business Administration and Economics at the University of Haifa, analyses the Israeli government's proposed bail-out of the Histadrut Labor Federation's collapsed pension funds and how to solve the problem. Plaut asserts that passage of the deal would be an unprecedented blow to the Israeli economy: the price tag is estimated at $33 billion, about 40 percent of Israel's annual GDP. This is roughly 15 times the size (proportionally) of the American saving and loan bailout of the 1980s. This study shows that the worst part of the bail-out is the plan's inability to address the causes of the crisis. The bail-out leaves the management of the pension funds in the hands of the very people who oversaw the creation of the present actuarial deficits. It does nothing to change the monopolistic, uncompetitive structure of the pension industry in Israel, nor does it address the lack of independent supervision of the pension industry. Plaut recommends that free entry and competition should be allowed among pension plans; issuing subsidized government bonds to the pension funds must end at once; actuarial solvency must be made mandatory, and an independent supervisory body must be established to shut down plans not in compliance. 17 pp. CONTACT: The Shalem Center National Policy Institute, 5 Eliash St., Jerusalem, ISRAEL, 02/254-185, or fax 02/256-720.

<p><b>Integrated Systems in Frontier Health Care Delivery: The Unique Needs of Wyoming,</b> 
edited by Sheryl R. Fox and Alexander T. Hunt<br>
The Center for Strategic and International Studies
<p>This report provides an overview of frontier health care delivery issues from varying perspectives and suggests possible technological and structural solutions to reform health care delivery systems in rural and frontier states. Specifically, the report examines the potential for telemedicine to improve rural health care systems and assesses both the economic implications of telemedicine for health care providers as well as obstacles to its implementation. Contributors raise several key points: First, national health care reform, by its very nature, will be anti-rural, transferring rural wealth to urban areas through whatever taxes are used to extend coverage to the uninsured. Second, in reforming health care, states like Wyoming will most likely need to develop networks based on providers to maximize access to health services. Third, telemedicine, the transmission of image and data via communications technology used by health care providers for treatment, diagnosis, and education of patients irrespective of distance, offers a way to bridge the health care gap in frontier states. This report is the summary of the CSIS Health Care Forum Series. 39 pp. CONTACT: The Center for Strategic and International Studies, 1800 K St., NW, Suite 400, Washington, DC  20006, 202/887-0200.

The Evergreen Freedom Foundation
<p>Stephen Barchet, chairman of the Washington Medical Savings Account Project, presents his findings from a study to evaluate whether Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) are a viable health care alternative. The study was completed through on-site investigations of companies using MSAs, and their research revealed the following facts: 1) reduced health care expenditures to both the sponsor/employer and employees; 2) wiser use of health services by consumers; 3) greater use of preventative services; 4) increased consumer involvement in health care decisions and purchases; and 5) strong employee participation and satisfaction. Barchet also finds that the sick and poor are better served than in many "managed-care" programs, since they have the same access to health care as everyone else. This study confirms that people controlling their own health care dollars with MSAs do not need huge central bureaucracies to make intimate health care decisions for them. MSAs allow patient choice, high quality medical service, and lower spending all of the benefits government plans promise without the costly, inefficient invasion of a centrally run bureaucracy. 54 pp. CONTACT: The Evergreen Freedom Foundation, P.O.

<p><b>SSI: The Black Hole of the Welfare State,</b> by Christopher M. Wright<br>
<i>Policy Analysis No. 224,</i> Cato Institute
<p>Christopher Wright examines why the current reforms of the Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program fall far short of the dramatic overhaul that the open-ended entitlement program needs. The author states that the ultimate goal should be to privatize disability insurance programs. In the meantime, any serious attempts to reform the system, according to Wright, should include the following: 1) ending automatic cost-of-living adjustments; 2) eliminating retroactive lump sum payments; 3) abolishing all SSI assistance to drug addicts and alcoholics; 4) establishing an enrollment cap for SSI. This study concludes that unless the program's costs are brought under control, by the year 2000 SSI will be larger than Aid to Families with Dependent Children, food stamps, subsidized housing, the earned income tax credit, and all other forms of public assistance except Medicaid. Major reform, and ultimately privatization, are needed to rein in this costly and corrupt entitlement program. 35 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20001, 202/842-0200.

This report call for a departure in the way America administers its social welfare programs, stating that what most poor people want are opportunities and responsibilities, not just rights and entitlements. As a result of their findings, the task force has found three principles fundamental to turning the tide of poverty: first, funding and authority for designing and providing services to the poor should be devolved not just from the federal government to the state level, but to the community-based organizations that demonstrate success in dealing with the problems of poverty. Second, individuals and communities must be empowered to create their own solutions through policies that emphasize personal and financial asset development. Third, the present maintenance-focused welfare system must be replaced by policies that promote strong families and emphasize personal responsibility and the development of self-sufficiency. 25 pp. CONTACT: National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, 1367 Connecticut Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20036, 202/331-1103.

by Jed L. Babbin and Thomas Earl Patton<br>
<i>Critical Legal Issues: Working Paper Series No. 63,</i> Washington Legal Foundation
<p>This working paper argues that the Clinton Administration's bid protest reform proposal is flawed in its reliance on faulty statistical analysis and its failure to recognize the importance of bid protests in the government procurement process. The authors demonstrate how the flaws in the data underlying the administration's recommendations include overstatement of the number of contract awards actually protested and exaggeration of the amount of time protested contracts are delayed. This paper claims that the Administration's opposition to these recommendations overlooks the General Services board of Contract Appeals process, which allows judges dealing with a complex information technology protest to be experienced in technical issues, providing a suspension mechanism to compel and agency to stop performance of the contract during the protest period. The authors suggest some solutions to bid protest problems, including the imposition of liability for frivolous protests, disallowing protest costs for protests that are not granted in their overhead pools, and requiring alternative dispute resolution before proceeding with protests to the General Services Board of Contract Appeals or the General Accounting Office. 23 pp. CONTACT: Washington Legal Foundation, 2009 Massachusetts Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20036, 202/588-0302.

<p><b>The Case for Fundamental Tort Reform,</b> by Michael J. Horowitz<br>

<p>Horowitz maintains that the lawyers' monopoly of access to the courts allows them to impose a 33.33 to 40 percent toll charge on all damage recoveries, even in cases in which defendants are willing to pay on a rapid, no-dispute basis. Contingency fees, the near-uniform means of compensating tort claim attorneys, can provide risk-free windfall of profits to lawyers while harming defendants, plaintiffs, and the economy as a whole. Horowitz demonstrates that true reform of the US tort system should include early offer reforms, which seek to ensure the settlement of large numbers of cases before expensive trials and pretrial proceedings, and contingency fee reform, which protects clients from having to pay their attorneys windfall fees far out of proportion to the work performed and the risks assumed in taking a case. 8 pp. CONTACT: The Hudson Institute, Herman Kahn Center, P.O.

<p><b>Punitive Damages: Once Is Enough,</b> by Richard J. Mahoney<br>
<i>Occasional Paper 150,</i> Center for the Study of American Business
<p>Richard Mahoney, a distinguished executive in residence at the Center for the Study of American Business, states that, under certain limited conditions, granting punitive damages can have merit. However, the author warns, the current practice of allowing punitive damages to be awarded over and over again to different plaintiffs against the same defendant for essentially the same issues is illogical. Mahoney presents the results of an informal survey conducted among a large group of American firms: a representative group of 43 large corporations reported that in the past five years a total of $4.4 billion was involved in settlements driven by punitive damages. Mahoney suggests the most practical answer available is legislation at the federal level, like the Hatch bill, that would forbid the repeated award of punitive damages for the same issue. In addition, in order to protect potential claimants against a single punitive award foreclosing a later, larger amount, judges would be empowered to permit punitive damages a second time if the first award was held to be an "insufficient deterrent." 14 pp. CONTACT: Center for the Study of American Business, Washington University, Campus Box 1208, One Brooking Drive, St. Louis, MO 63130-4899, 314/935-5682.

<p><b>The 1995 Crime Bills: Is the GOP the Party of Liberty and Limited Government?, </b>
by Jarett B. Decker<br>
<i>Policy Analysis No. 229,</i> Cato Institute
<p>Attorney Jarett B. Decker asserts that everyday crime that disrupts American life is largely a local problem, best handled by state and local law enforcement agencies. Despite this, Congress has become increasingly involved in fighting crime on a federal level, in order to be perceived as being active on the issue of crime. Decker states that the 1995 GOP crime bills introduced in the House and Senate promise more of the same, but with unprecedented provisions what would threaten freedom and undermine the fair administration of justice: the Senate bill includes a provision that would exempt federal prosecutors from the rules of legal ethics; both the Senate and House crime bills would enable federal agents to invade homes, raid businesses, and conduct humiliating body searches without legal justification, while reaping the benefits of evidence collected through such illegal searches; and the Senate bill would enable federal agents to detain citizens, hold them incommunicado, interrogate them for day, weeks or months, and use any of their statements in any subsequent prosecution. 41 pp. CONTACT: Cato Institute, 1000 Massachusetts Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20001, 202/842-0200.

<p><b>Slashing Congressional Spending, Part I: Congressional Pay, Pensions, Perks, and Staff,</b> by Dan Greenberg<br>
<i>Backgrounder No. 1034,</i> The Heritage Foundation
<p>Heritage Congressional Analyst Dan Greenberg states that, despite the initial cutbacks imposed on the Congress by the new Republican leadership, further steps are necessary to reduce perks, reform pensions, and further trim staff. This paper cites several problems with these initial reforms: 1) automatic pay raises are still scheduled each year; 2) Congressional pensions far exceed most private sector plans and benefits exceed those of most other federal employees; 3) taxpayer-funded mailings, travel, and other perks are abused to promote incumbents' reelection bids; and 4) Congress remains the most heavily staffed legislature in the world. Greenberg addresses each of these continuing problems and warns the new Congress not to become complacent. 15 pp. CONTACT: Julie Davis, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts Ave., NE, Washington, DC 20002, 202/546-4400 ext. 565, fax 202/544-0961, e-mail 74157.372@compuserve.com.

<p>John Whitehead, a constitutional attorney and president of the Rutherford Insititute, questions where to draw a line between the wordly call for political correctness and God's call for "biblical" correctness. This booklet gives its readers four ways to fight religious censorship: 1) fully understanding one's religious beliefs; 2) supporting freedom of expression for all; 3) asserting one's rights and those of others; 4) teaching values to children. Whitehead writes, "In a society where secularism rules and tolerance is the greatest value, Christianity has become a target."

Loury writes as a "veteran of the academic culture wars" and describes a balance between fulfilling the expectations of others and living with integrity. The author explores various philosophical aspects of the racial debate both on American campuses and in America and describes victimization as the one constant, uniting feature of minority Americans. Loury unequivocally states that "whites do not need to be shown how to fear black youths, they must be taught to respect them."

<p><h2><i>Legal Action</h2></i>

<b><p>INSTITUTE FOR JUSTICE
<p>New Jersey Family Cap Found Constitutional</b><br>
On May 4, 1995, a federal judge ruled in favor of New Jersey's family cap welfare reform experiment.  The lawsuit filed in 1993 by Legal Services of New Jersey and others had asked the judge to block the cap and vacate the federal waiver that permitted it, on the grounds that the federal waiver was unlawful and the reform violated procedural and consitutional rights. The judge stated in his decision that the cap "does not violate any statutory or constitutional mandate," thus upholding the validity of the federal waiver and the program. 
The Institute for Justice filed an amicus brief on behalf of American Legislative Exchange Council, Independent Women's Forum, The Empowerment Network, and five New Jersey AFDC recipients; and played an active role in defending the program. 17 states are currently pursuing similar programs to reform their welfare systems.

<p><b>Institute Challenges Barriers to Interracial Adoption</b ><br>
On April 13, 1995, the Institute for Justice launched a nationwide challenge to "race matching" by state agencies to establish a rule of law that racial discrimination in adoptions is unconstitutional. Its first two test cases are in Texas and Tennessee. In Austin, Texas, the Institute filed a class action lawsuit against the Texas Department of Protective and Regulatory Services, the agency charged with protecting abandoned and neglected children. In Memphis, Tennessee, the Institute joins as co-counsel in an ongoing federal class action, Reisman v. Tennessee Dept. of Human Services. In Reisman, the plaintiff class of minority children in the custody of the Tennessee Department of Human Services challenges the use of racial classifications in the adoptive placement process. Joining the Institute as co-counsel in Texas will be Harvard Law Professors Elizabeth Bartholet, Randall Kennedy, and Laurence Tribe.

<p><b>Repealing the Davis-Bacon Act: Round I</b><br>
In an order released on May 8, federal judge William B. Bryant denied the government's motion to dismiss a constitutional challenge to the Davis-Bacon Act, filed by the Institute for Justice on behalf of minority contractors and public housing tenant groups on the ground that the law is racially discriminatory. The law, which requires "prevailing wages" on nearly all federal contracts, was passed in 1931 and aimed at restricting minority entrepreneurs and workers from competing with mainly white construction unions. The US Department of Labor, which is defending the law, argued that the law was not enacted for discriminatory purposes and asked the court to dismiss the lawsuit. In a one page order, the court refused to do so, allowing the case to proceed.

<p>University of Virginia Restores Conservative Student Magazine's Funding</b><br>
A conservative student magazine at the University of Virginia won its appeal of a decision to defund the publication because it was a "political organization." With the assistance of Landmark Legal Foundation, students who publish <i>The Virginia Advocate</i> fought the student council decision citing their constitutional rights to free speech and equal protection of the laws.</i> The Virginia Advocate</i> is the only conservative student publication at the University of Virginia.
The students' appeal was heard on May 3, 1995 by the University's Student Activites Committee, whose chairman is dean of students Robert Canevari.<i> The Virginia Advocate</i>'s editor, Ellen J. Riegel, argued the magazine's appeal. Landmark's attorney, Pete Hutchison, provided a legal memorandum to the committee outlining the constitutional infirmity of the decision.
Landmark told the committee that the student council's decision "violated the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection of the laws to the students who publish<i> The Virginia Advocate </i>through viewpoint discrimination." The Foundation also pointed out student council funding of such groups as Straight and Gay for Equality, which promotes candidates and legislation advancing a liberal agenda, and a wide range of other organizations promoting a liberal agenda.

<b><p>NATIONAL RIGHT TO WORK LEGAL DEFENSE FOUNDATION, INC.

<p>Foundation Sues Clinton to Enjoin Strike Order</b><br>
National Right to Work attorneys filed a lawsuit to halt enforcement of a Clinton executive order prohibiting federal contractors from hiring permanent replacement workers during a strke. The order enacted the policies of the so-called "Anti-Striker Replacement" legislation which Congress has twice rejected.
"The President trampled on the rights of workers by unilaterally enacting policies to punish workers who choose to work during a strike. He's sweeping the Constitution under the rug so he can please his Big Labor friends," said National Right to Work Foundation Vice President Timothy McConville.
Attorneys from the Foundation filed the suit in US District Court in Washington, DC, on behalf of Representatives John Doolittle (CA), David Funderburk (NC), Ernest Istook (OK), and Harris Fawell (IL). The complaint charges that by issuing the executive order, President Clinton has usurped the constitutional authority soley vested in the Congress to make laws and regulate commerce.
"Most observers agree the result will be more strikes, McConville said. "Union officials would call any strike they want and win every strike they call as easily as pushing a button. With more strike powers, the union officials will have more power to force workers to pay union dues, busting holes in state Right to Work laws."

<b><p>NEW ENGLAND LEGAL FOUNDATION

<p>NELF Coalition Wins Complete Victory in RI Tidal Land Litigation</b><br>
Four years ago the Rhode Island Supreme Court released an opinion which implied that land ever below the median high tide mark ("tidal land") might be subject to a "public trust." That decision raised the threat that the state might be allowed to charge fees or impose public access requirements for use of such land. Because the commercial heart of Providence is tidal land, the implications of the court's decision on the state's economy were troubling. Title insurance and mortgage for this land became difficult to purchase.
NELF responded to this challenge over the next four years by organizing a coalition of the state's major landowners. The coalition decided that the best way to resolve the uncertainty brought about by the court decision was to initiate a second, test case which would give the court a chance to clarify and, hopefully, minimize the scope of the public trust. NELF helped prepare the test plaintiff's brief and filed its own amicus brief on behalf of a number of major Providence landowners.
The first major development in the case came last year when the state conceded that the most important part of the Providence tidal land, the "cove," was free from trust. Last month the Rhode Island Supreme Court decided the remaining issue, the status of the remaining "harbor line" tidal lands. This final decision is a complete victory landowners. The court held that all land which a landowner has filled out to a legislatively established harbor line becomes completely free from any trust. Downtown Providence's landowners have now been confirmed in the full ownership rights they thought they had possessed all along.
<p><b>Connecticut Court Joins Chorus Striking Down Ban on Phone Companies' Entry into Cable TV</b><br>
In a case in which NELF filved an amicus brief on behalf of the Connecticut Business and Industry Association (CBIA) and the New England Council, the US District Court in Hartford, Connecticut has joined the growing number of federal courts which have struck down the ban on local telephone companies' entering the cable television industry. NELF, CBIA, and the Council argued that the ban violated the first amendment rights of not only the local telephone company, Southern New Telecommunications, but it also unconstitutionally limited the television choices that should be coming available to consumers. As the entertainment and communication industries grown ever closer, NELF intends to work to ensure that local telephone companies can become major sources of innovation and competition in the telecommunications industry.
<p><b>NELF to Enter Massachusetts Employment Sex Harassment Case</b><br>
NELF will file an amicus brief in the Massachusetts Appeals Court supporting the dismissal of an employee's sex harassment case. The case was dismissed because of the plaintiff's failure to have used the comprehensive procedures of the Massachusetts employment discrimination act, Mass. G.L. c. 151B. A Superior Court judge held that this failure precludes her suing her employer on any "corollary claim" arising out of the same facts. In this case that meant that the employee's claims of statutory sexual harassment, violation of equal rights, negligence, breach of contract, and intentional infliction of emotional distress were all barred. the court's reasoning followed closely two Massachusetts Supreme Judiciial Court cases in which NELF was involved last year.

<p>Supreme Court Lets WLF Civil Rights Victory Stand</b><br>
On May 22, the U.S. Supreme Court announced that it would not review the pathbreaking Fourth Circuit decision in favor of WLF's client, a Hispanic student, in his suit against the University of Maryland's black-only scholarship program.  The Court had been urged by the Clinton Administration and more than 60 interest groups and universities to reverse WLF's victory, which calls into question the legality of race-based scholarship programs at public universities across the country.  The suit was part of WLF's effort to oppose government programs that classify citizens by race.

<p><b>WLF Appeals in Challenge to Texas IOLTA Program</b><br>
WLF has asked the Fifth Circuit to strike down Texas's Interest on Lawyers' Trust Accounts (IOLTA) program, which requires attorneys to turn over interest generated by their clients' trust accounts to fund legal services organizations.  In 1992, more than $150 million was raised by IOLTA programs nationwide, nearly $10 million in Texas alone.  WLF argued that the program violates the First Amendment by forcing Texans to associate with political causes with which they disagree and that it violates the Fifth Amendment by taking their property without just compensation.  WLF's suit, now on appeal, was rejected by a federal district judge in January.

<p><b>WLF Supports Virginia Against EPA</b><br>
WLF has filed a brief in the Fourth Circuit supporting Virginia's lawsuit against the EPA over the agency's requirement that Virginia change its rules for standing in its state courts.  The EPA has ordered Virginia to allow third parties the right to obtain judicial review of emissions permit approvals, whether or not the parties would have standing to sue under state law.  The EPA's position, if upheld, would enable groups such as the Sierra Club to impede the expansion or modernization of plants even where the state has given its approval.  WLF argued that Congress never intended the Clean Air Act to require this radical expansion of the availability of third-party standing in state courts.

<b><p>WLF Brief Opposes Racial Gerrymandering</b><br>
WLF, representing Congressman Gary Franks, urged the Supreme Court in Miller v. Johnson to strike down Georgia's redistricting plan on the grounds that it improperly drew lines so as to segregate black and white voters into separate congressional districts.  Under pressure from the Justice Department, the Georgia legislature created a district in 1992 with a strange layout, having uninhabited "land bridges" as little as a mile wide to connect black sections of urban areas.  WLF argued that such racial gerrymandering is unconstitutional and also pointed out that black candidates such as Rep. Franks have won elections in majority-white districts.

<b><p>WLF Urges Court to Recognize Constitutional Limits On Punitive Damages</b><br>
WLF filed a brief in the U.S. Supreme Court arguing that the Court should strike down an Alabama court's $2 million punitive damages award against BMW.  The suit was brought by a physician who learned that BMW had refinished the car to repair slight paint defects incurred during shipment to the United States. WLF argued that the award, which was 500 times the amount of the economic damage suffered by the car buyer, was clearly excessive and violated due process.<br>

<b>The Return of George Sutherland: Restoring a Jurisprudence of Natural Rights<br>
Hadley Arkes (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1994)
</b>
<P>
   Conventional histories of the Supreme Court
describe George Sutherland, who was seated at the Court from 1922
to 1938, as a mainstay of the "Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse"
 a sinister reactionary whose blunt, ideological dissents were
blindly devoted to business interests but failed to engage or
accept the emerging reality of the New Deal constitutional revolution.
Hadley Arkes's remarkable intellectual history, "The Return
of George Sutherland: Restoring a Jurisprudence of Natural Rights,"
reveals a far more subtle and textured portrait of Sutherland:
a sophisticated political thinker who was able to intellectually
outflank his philosophical adversaries and was willing to follow
the logic of his principles even when they drove him outside of
the respectable opinion of his day. Arkes's book is a compelling
portrait of a life animated by ideas, ideas that inspired Sutherland,
at the age of twenty, to copy paragraphs of natural rights theory
into his commonplace book (one of its pages is reproduced as Arkes's
frontispiece) and, at a more advanced age, to import its abstractions
into the often dry details of the law.     But the law, and the
controversies that it raises, are anything but dry when Arkes
describes them. He discusses a hidden Sutherland, one who led
the fight in the Senate for women's suffrage by making Lincolnesque
arguments about natural rights. On the Court, Sutherland reading
the categorical language of the First Amendment argued that the
Constitution categorically barred Congress from placing any limits
on the freedom of the press. In short, for a reactionary, he was
surprisingly progressive even, in some respects, radical.    
<P>
 Arkes sketches a compelling profile of Sutherland and the philosophical
tradition that he represents, demonstrating how the opinions of
the preRoosevelt Court that are generally held to embody a reactionary,
probusiness agenda turn out to benefit employees and the general
public as much or more than they benefit employers. The Old Court
struck down Arizona's law requiring that 80% of a business's workers
be nativeborn; without Court action, Mike Raich  an Austrian immigrant
 would have been out of a job. Sutherland's opinion, in a case
in which a minimum wage for women (but not for men) was struck
down, permitted women to hold onto their jobs, rather than being
displaced by men legally empowered to work for less money. But
the key to understanding Sutherland's jurisprudence is precisely
that he avoided making judgments of constitutionality on utilitarian
grounds, insisting that a coherent theory of natural rights would
lead to a compelling constitutional vision. Sutherland steadfastly
refused to take judicial notice of the happy coincidence that
his constitutional theories would also benefit the public.   
<P> Arkes, through his examination of Sutherland, makes plain what
the reserved language of Sutherland's judicial opinions are sometimes
only able to hint at: that the intellectual foundations of the
modern welfare state rest only on thin air. The knowledge of the
details of complex commercial enterprises that its regulations
presume are rarely to be found in those who would draft them.
The justice of the benefits and burdens that price regulation
attaches arbitrarily to various activities is difficult to justify
or discern. Arkes's description of Brandeisian jurisprudence,
an almost perfect foil to Sutherland's work, is penetrating, even
withering, especially when Arkes sketches how painfully oblivious
Brandeis is to contrary arguments.
  <P>
   Arkes also demonstrates
how Sutherland's fidelity to the bounded nature of the concepts
and texts judges must work with determines his decisions in the
cases before him. Sutherland's strict attention to the history
and meaning of such terms of constitutional art as "commerce,"
"delegation," and "general welfare" and, more
generally, to the necessary implications of the structure of the
Constitution guards against an interpretive slippage that leads
to unlimited government discretion. His method is a refreshing
change from much constitutional law today, which uses crucially
unmoored concepts like "dignity" to get the Court where
its judges want it to go. A problem with this approach  one which
Sutherland's more formal approach solves  is that, without careful
attention to the meaning and limits of words in the law, they
function much like Rorschach inkblots, revealing more about the
way their witnesses think and what they want to do than anything
else.
<P>
      Arkes's book makes a persuasive case that we need more
of Justice Sutherland's radicalism in the world today  a radicalism
that Arkes sets against both the common law's remnants of sympathy
for regulation as well as its continuation in the modern New Deal
state. It is a radicalism that should find many sympathizers.
Those who are deemed unfit to provide for themselves and for their
families because of the terrifying dangers of unregulated taxicabs,
haircuts, and shoeshine stands  as well as other victims of the
regulatory state would likely be sympathetic to Sutherland's views
that people have natural rights to occupational freedom.  
<P>
   It
is difficult in a brief review to give more than a glimpse of
this powerful book, but its fascinating mixture of political theory
and constitutional law provides an intellectual drama that is
rarely seen in books about the Court. Those who seek a model to
get today's Court back on track and in philosophical trim will
benefit from Arkes's readable study.

<b>They're Back!</b><br> 
The Harvard freshman orientation seminar is back alive and kicking. In 1994 the Heritage Foundation had succeeded in killing it off with its own alternative orientation for freshmen Republicans. Encouraged by the new House leadership, enough freshmen opted for Heritage over Harvard that Ivy League school canceled its event altogether. At the time, it was good riddance. Going to Harvard right after becoming a congressman was always exactly the wrong way to get started, enduring huge doses of goo-goo liberal good government and stern lectures about working together and bi-partisanship right off the bat. But now, in another sign of the return to "normalcy" in Washington and American politics, Harvard is back. The good news is that most Republican freshmen are still staying away: 35 Democrats and six Republicans attended the Harvard event. They heard from such luminaries as former Dole chief of staff Sheila Burke (now the executive dean of the Kennedy School), outgoing Clinton flack and media darling George Stephanopoulos, and former Bush policy advisor Roger Porter who best captured the spirit of the hapless Bush Administration and would allegedly judge applicants for White House policy jobs on the basis of their tennis games. Anyone who learns about Washington from this crew may never recover. The six Republicans who attended, according to a Harvard list, were: Merrill Cook (Utah), James Gibbons (Nevada), Asa Hutchinson (Ark.), Charles Pickering (Mississippi), Joe Pitts (Pennsylvania) and John Sununu (N.H. ). Count it as one strike against them.

<b>Media Bias Revisited</B><br>
A while back we discussed William Powers's maiden effort as <I>The New Republic</I>'s media critic. We complained that liberals who acknowledge the existence of anti-conservative media bias feel that they must simultaneously slam conservatives for having a crude , conspiratorial view of that bias. In fact, we observed, most conservative press critics understand the sociological reasons for media bias and accept that it is generally not deliberate or orchestrated. One of our readers kindly passed along an article  from <I>NR</I>'s special issue on the press (June 21, 1993)  that nicely makes the point. Ted J. Smith III wrote: "In short, by any reasonable standard, the case for widespread bias in reporting has been made. This does not imply, as some members of the press seem to imagine, that journalists have been found guilty of consciously slanting the news to make it conform with their ideological perspectives. While this may occur on occasion, what is more commonand more insidiousis the sort of bias that reflects the  unconscious assumptions of the writer. This emerges in such things as the kind of adjectives he employs, the kind of 'experts' he quotes, the kind of organizations he considers authoritative, and the kind of issues he thinks important." . . . And while we 're on the subject: Brent Bozell's Media Research Center Awards for the worst quotes of 1996 will be out by the end of the week. Our own Kate O'Beirne was one of the judges.

<b>Musical RNC Chairs</b><br>
The race for RNC chairman is getting more crowded. Texas GOP chairman Tom Pauken has announced his candidacy, which is being promoted by the conservative weekly <I>Human Events</I>. Pauken is smart, principled, and in Texas he has successfully knit together the  social and economic wings of the conservative movement. Announcing his candidacy, Pauken said: "Under my leadership the RNC will be a member-driven organization with an increased emphasis on rebuilding the grassroots Reagan coalition of economic and social  conservatives. By reactivating the Reagan coalition as well as forming other coalitions with those who believe in economic liberty, limited government, and the traditional American values that made our country great, the Republican Party will be able to  retain and increase its control of Congress in 1998 and make a unified effort to reclaim the presidency." Also entering the race is ex-RNC co-chair Jeanie Austin, who flirted with the interesting idea of running on a joint ticket with Rep. J. C. Watts, but  Watts declined. Austin will appeal to those convinced the party needs more high-profile women to combat its "gender gap" problem. Austin says that's not why she's running, but noted: "I have devoted a good part of my career in the Republican Party, recruiting women into the party, and getting women elected to office. I think our party needs to pay closer attention to what women are saying, and we need to listen to their ideas and concerns." The Christian Coalition has flagged Pauken, ex-New Hampshire Gov. Steve  Merrill, and California GOP chairman John Herrington as its preferred candidates. At this point the race is wide open, but the RNC insiders who will be doing the voting at the winter meeting on Jan. 17 are likely to favor one of their own, a fellow insider. This certainly spells trouble for Pauken and Merrill.

<b>Cohen-Head</b>
The cabinet pick Republicans should be happiest about (at least from a cynical political perspective) is probably Bill Cohen at Secretary of Defensealthough not for the reasons the Clinton Administration thinks. The bi-partisan bounce Clinton will get from this pick will last about two weeks; as soon as Cohen is confirmed the honeymoon ends. Then Clinton gets to deal with side of Cohen Republicans are so familiar withthat is his unreliable, disloyal side. The <I>Washington Post</I>'s Al Kamen recently provided a run-down of his record: Cohen broke with other Republicans during Watergate to vote to send articles of impeachment against Nixon to the House floor; during the Reagan Administration he constantly undercut the Administration's position on Nicaragua; he was skeptical of the Gulf War and at one point told Bush: "We visited the Kuwaitis, we saw the Kuwaitis, and we realized that Kuwaitis are willing to fightuntil every U.S. soldier has dropped." Cohen reportedly got the job on the strength of his interview with the President. But he has no management experience and beginning today all his cachet with Republicans is shot; Clinton is about to learn the limits of a pleasant conversationalist as Secretary of Defense.

<b>Fourth-Floor, Hardcore</b><br>
Hard-core House conservatives have made a concerted effort to get office space together on the fourth floor of the Cannon House office building, the better to coordinate their strategy in the next session of Congress. Get a load of this: on one corridor of the fourth floor of the Cannon building the line-up is John Hostettler (Ind.), John Shadegg (Ariz.), Tom Coburn (Okla.), Todd Tiahrt (Kan.), Steve Largent (Okla.), Gil Gutknecht (Minn.), Zach Wamp (Tenn.), Walter Jones (N.C.), Mark Souder (Ind.), Steve Stockman (Tex.), Mark Neumann (Wisc.), Jon Christensen (Neb.), John Ensign (Nev.), and, right around the corner, Ed Bryant (Tenn.). Whew! Texas Democrat Lloyd Doggett was briefly angling for space on Cannon's fourth floor, but when he realized who surrounded him he gave it up. Look for New Jersey Democrat Frank Pallone, plopped down in the middle of this right-wing real estate, to begin to look for new accommodations soon too (or maybe he'll convert). The House leadership, not eager to face pressure from the Right, can't like the idea of having all these guys together. Says one House aide: "They're going to post sentries, I think, on either end of the hallway."
<P>
<b>Tidbits and Outrages</b><br>
<I>The Washington Monthly</I> has a soporific reputation. It's concentrated for the last several years on nuts-and-bolts policy analysis - more nuts than bolts, if you ask us. Now the magazine has embarrassed itself by giving its monthly journalism award to Donald Barlett and James Steele for their interminable <I>Philadelphia Inquirer</I> series "America: Who Stole the Dream?" which has now, inevitably, been released as a book. It's been hooted by columnists right and center for its ludicrous and often self-contradictory arguments, its primitive "analysis," and its ignorance of basic economicsthemes that, alas, run through Barlett and Steele's work. <I>The Washington Monthly</I>, however, not only gave B&S an award, but excerpt their book in the same issue. This odd sort of self-dealing appears to be a pattern at the monthly: in his section of the magazine, editor Charlie Peters takes the <I>California Journal</I>'s side in a legal dispute with the <I>Wall Street Journal</I>; later in the magazine, the <I>California Journal</I>'s managing editor has a long article.

<b>The Senate's Only Democratic Committee Chairman</b><br>
Bad news for conservatives in the Senate. Indiana Sen. Dan Coats has decided not to challenge Vermont Senator James Jeffords for chairmanship of the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee. The committee has always been a trouble spot, featuring some of the Democrats' most liberal Senators and some of the Republicans' most accommodating members. Retiring "Clueless in Kansas" Sen. Nancy Kassebaum was the last chairman, and with Jeffords taking over for her, if anything, the panel will get worse. Jeffords was the only Republican sponsor of the Clinton health care bill. His AFLCIO rating (45 per cent) is nearly as high as his U.S. Chamber of Commerce rating (55 per cent). In short, he's just the type of legislator who helped make the U.S. Senate a graveyard for House initiatives over the last two years. But disloyalty apparently has its rewardnow he's going to be chairman of one of the Senate's most important committees.

<b>Bias Squared</b><br>
"What every conservative press critic preaches, and almost every reporter denies, is largely true: the mainstream press is liberal," writes William Powers in the cover story of this week's <I>New Republic</I>. ". . . When conservatives huff about the cabal of liberal journalists that is constantly plotting to slant coverage, they are right about the effects but wrong about the cause. There is no plotting at all: liberal bias flows from principles so deeply held they're mostly unconscious." It's nice, we guess, to get another admission of liberal media bias by a non-conservative. But somehow such admissions always come wrapped in layers of condescension. No serious conservative press criticcertainly not L. Brent Bozell and his colleagues at the Media Research Center, perhaps the most prolificmaintains that reporters are "constantly plotting to slant coverage." (Notice, by the way, the pejorative choice of verb, "huff," which is a standard <I>TNR</I> technique for parroting an observation and slamming the observer simultaneously.) Most conservatives think that for a variety of sociological reasons journalists tend to be liberal, and this fact affects their coverage. Evidently Powers agrees. Couldn't he just say that on this point, conservatives are unambiguously right?

<b>Sin Tax Sins</b><br>
Libertarian <I>Washington Post<I/> columnist James Glassman today defends liquor companies' right to advertise their product. Guardians of the public health, he suggests, ought to try to raise beer taxes instead. He writes that "we don't tax beer nearly enough. Currently, the United States earns"surely he means "takes"?as much in excise taxes from a single bottle of scotch as it does from 39 cans of beer, according to Congressional Budget Office figures." Say it ain't so, Jim! Repeat after us: Beer isn't undertaxed; scotch is overtaxed.

Jeff Rosen's gargantuan cover story in the <I>New Republic</I> on "O.J. Simpson, critical race theory, American law, and the triumph of color over justice" is attracting a lot of attention. Hilton Kramer and Maureen Dowd have both called it "brilliant." We're fans of Rosen, but this time we must demur. The essay's critique of critical race theory is neither novel nor sufficiently pointed. The article's only original insight is the linkage between that theory and the Simpson trial, which is sort of obvious. Finally, his critique is more aesthetic than intellectual or moral. He uses the word "crude" more often than "wrong" to describe arguments. . . . 
<P>
In the same issue, Jacob Heilbrunnthe only person who has identified himself as one of the folks who joined Michael Lind's alleged exodus of intellectuals from the Righthas a shoddier article on "a startling new species: fellow travelers on the right" who apologize for anti-democratic regimes like Lee Kuan Yew's Singapore. Some of the examples are howlers: outgoing Sen. William Cohen ("R.," Me.) can hardly be described as part of the Right. A more glaring weakness is that Heilbrunn's proposed parallelism between the leftist attachment to Marxist regimes and revolutionaries and the right's alleged embrace of "Asian values" ignores the distinctioncentral to conservative foreign-policy thought for a decade and a halfbetween authoritarian and totalitarian regimes. Some conservatives may defend dictatorships on grounds that amount "to a relativistic multiculturalism." But a much older tradition of conservatism looks askance at the notion that there is one best set of political arrangements that works everywherenot because sound values vary from place to place, but because circumstances do. And lastly, Heilbrunn should have noted that plenty of conservatives have criticized Singapore's regime. Its censorship of reporter Christopher Lingle, an incident Heilbrunn mentions, was, for instance, the subject of a story in <I>National Review</I>.

<b>Investment Advice</b><br>
Jim Glassman's "Your Money" column in the Sunday <I>Washington Post</I> focuses on Jim Grant's bearish views. Grant says the stock market has entered its "absurd phase." Yields on dividend-paying stocks have fallen to 2.2 per cent, "even below their level just before the October 1987 crash." The average Standard & Poor p/e ratio recently hit 20, where it was only 15 last year. (Glassman doesn't note that some analysts think structural changes in the economy are raising the trendline p/e ratio.) And then Glassman adds a cute point: "Another danger is that nearly all market advisers think that stocks will keep rising. That's proven to be a negative sign in the past." Grant "believes a decline in the market is imminent, and, if it occurs, investors will not ride it out. They'll sell their funds. Managers will have to dump shares to meet the redemptions, driving prices down further." Glassman thinks, on the other hand, that investors should hold on to their stocks but not buy any new ones.

<b>Boys Will Be Boys</b><br>
For some reason, <I>Washington Times</I> columnist Wesley Pruden delights in sexual slurs against his assorted enemies: "They're not real men" is his constant theme, even when he's discussing women. Normally this is harmless enough. But it takes a particularly ugly twist in today's column, "Trashy talk can have its rewards." Pruden writes, "Only this week a court in Eau Claire, Wis., awarded a 21-year-old man a million dollars for 'pains and slights' suffered at the hands of his high-school chums, who razzed him because he was a homosexual who prefers lads to lassies. Such a deal. An award of a million dollars just to be the butt of a joke is enough to make anyone cheerful, if not gay. This kind of stuff could be catching, and there's even a government agency to make whiners feel good about themselves." Pruden's version of events is misleading on several counts. The award was $900,000; and it was an out-of-court settlement. But the real distortion is his out-of-context use of the phrase "'pains and slights'" and his own words "razzed" and "whiners." The man in this casea boy at the time, let's rememberwasn't just "razzed." He was shoved, spat upon, beaten, and urinated on. He was kicked in the abdomen so many times he required surgery. A good case can be made that awards and settlements shouldn't be this generous. But Pruden doesn't advance that case. Nor does he do a service to those conservatives who harbor moral objections to homosexual behavior and are unjustly accused of vile bigotry.
<P>
<b>Affirmative Distraction</b><br>
The latest <I>New Yorker</I> includes an essay by Alan Wolfe on affirmative action. Like a lot of writing on the subject, it focuses on race preferences to the exclusion of gender preferenceswhich is odd, since the latter is far more significant by many measures. The article has its insights, but it is marred by conceptual confusions and ignorance of the conservative movement. 
<P>
Most of the article is devoted to exploring the alleged implications of corporate America's attachment to racial preferences. He writes that "the right doesn't want to admit that affirmative action has the blessing of the marketplace." "In fact, there are no conservative arguments against the most effective and prevalent forms of affirmative action in America, those implemented by companies." This is, at the very least, muddled. It is simply erroneous to assume that all practices in the private sector are necessarily free-market phenomena: like HMOs, race preferences are at least partly an adaptation to an environment created by the government. Quotas, that is, prevent lawsuits alleging the infringement of state-created "rights." Quite a few conservatives would not have (political) objections to truly voluntary affirmative action, which would be neither required nor encouraged by the government. Clint Bolick, a leading libertarian foe of preferences whom Wolfe never mentions, has said as much; Dinesh D'Souza incorporated an argument along those lines in the conclusion of his much-excoriated <I>The End of Racism</I>.
<P> 
Wolfe's argument becomes slippery when he writes that "conservatives have only two choices: to become liberals if they are to reject affirmative action in the private sector, or to accept such affirmative action if they are to remain conservatives. So why haven't more conservatives endorsed affirmative action? One answer is that a surprising number of them haveor, at least, did. Even the Reagan Administration, for all its professed opposition to affirmative action, adopted the practice of 'race-norming'; that is, raising the scores of minorities on standardized tests to make them more comparable with the scores of whites." He then writes about the Nixon Administration's role in fostering preferences, which he says conservatives don't like to admit. This entire passage is, not to put too fine a point on it, nonsense. The practice of "race-norming" is not the sort of "affirmative action in the private-sector" that conservatives are supposedly obligated to support; and conservatives, who have no love for Nixon's domestic politics, almost always mention his role in the history of race preferences when they write about the subject.
<P> 
Wolfe's thesis collapses at the finish line. "Without governmental enforcement," he writes, "some private companies may indeed drop their enthusiasm for diversity and retreat to 'birds of a feather' hiring policies." If that's the case, how can it be said that affirmative action "has the blessing of the marketplace"? Plenty of conservatives, though not all of us, would have no problem with Wolfe's conclusion that "while it makes sense for government to aspire to color blindness in order to underscore the importance of universality, companies and private universities ought to be free to take race into account for reasons of pluralism." Here is what <I>NR</I> said about the subject in its August 14, 1995 issue: "Conservatives may argue among themselves over whether purely voluntary, private affirmative action should be banned (as adherence to the Civil Rights Act of 1964 would require), but market forces would probably minimize such discrimination once [government regulations encouraging it were eliminated]." Wolfe is clearly the type of liberal who likes to think that ideas that complex never occur to conservatives.

<b>Ominous News</b><br>
American Enterprise Institute pollster Karlyn Bowman isn't sure what to make of the trend, but it appears that public opinion toward government is softening. This could be, she says, a "prosperity effect": people tend to worry less about runaway government during good times. But might it also suggest a general flabbiness in Republicans' pressing the limited-government case these days?
<P>
<b>For Worse</b><br>
The <I>Washington Post</I> Style section today carries a front-page story on a wedding, titled "Every Girl's Dream." That ought to be enough information for our readers to figure out that the wedding concerned pairs two lesbians. (Heterosexual marriages don't warrant Style treatment unless they involve celebrities.) One woman's family plans to attend; the other woman's family is torn between, guess what, love and prejudice. You could, in other words, write the article half-asleep. ABC's <I>20/20</I> did a segment on same-sex marriages, cleverly titled "For Better or Worse," a few weeks ago. ABC at least allowed family members opposed to same-sex marriage to have a say; but of course, none of them were articulate. Under no circumstances is an articulate traditionalist case allowed on the air. Since it looks like the gay-rights side is going to win in a matter of years anyway, why not say conservatives surrender now, and spare ourselves an endless stream of saccharine documentaries?
<P>
<B>Word to the Wise</b><br>
<I>National Review</I> is sponsoring a forum at the Heritage Foundation next Tuesday, 24 p.m., on the politics of abortion. Does the Republican Party's pro-life stance hurt its political prospects, as is often claimed? Ann Stone, head of Republicans for Choice, and Jim Pinkerton will argue that it does and should be changed. Columnist Maggie Gallagher and Frank Cannon, of Lehrman Bell Mueller Cannon, will argue the contrary position. Karlyn Bowman of the American Enterprise Institute will walk us through poll data on the subject. And <I>NR</I>'s own Kate O'Beirne will moderate. Come one, come all.

<B>TNR Notes</B><br>

The latest <I>New Republic</I> includes an inaugural "TRB" column from its new editor, Michael Kelly, fresh from the <I>New Yorker</I>. It's as well written as ever, but more pointed and open in its political position: that of a chastened, centrist liberal. . . . We've had fun with Michael Walzer's effusions in the <I>New Republic</I>'s "The Hard Questions" column before. This week's isn't particularly amusing; it's just daft. Walzer argues that "the right way out of the 'culture wars'" is to provide government funding for groups like the Gay Men's Health Crisis and black Baptist nursery schools, in order to make these institutions as strong as groups like Catholic Charities and Lutheran Social Ministries, the expressions of an older "multiculturalism." Where to begin ticking off the conceptual problems here? Making independent organizations as government-dependent as Catholic Charities is a recipe not for a vibrant civil society but a neutered and standardized one. Moreover, diversity of "religion, ethnicity, race, and region" is not the same as multiculturalism and has never been so considered by its prominent latter-day critics. Catholics never demanded separatist group rights or their own language; Farrakhanites and Hispanic lobbies do. For them to demand state funds is to ask a polity to fund its own dissolution. And lastly, the phrase "culture wars" most importantly denotes conflicts over competing visions of justice, morality, human personhood, and their implications for such practices as abortion. Converting the Federal Government into a large Ford Foundation isn't going to make those conflicts disappear.

<B>The Bi-Partisan Trap</B><br>
Newt Gingrich and Dick Gephardt held a joint press conference over the weekend that was full of talk of reconciliation, and completing the people's work, and bi-partisanship. Which is fine as far as it goes. There is no need for Republicans to be gratuitously partisan or confrontational with the Administration. But Republicans should also keep in mind that President Clinton built his political recovery on smart, well-managed partisan confrontation on the issues of his choosing: Medicare, the balanced budget, the government shut-downs. People hate partisan conflict in theory, but will endorse it in practice as long as it is marshaled against something they oppose (like the Clinton health-care bill back in 1993). Republicans might want to apply this lesson to the President's proposed intervention in Zaire. There is no national interest at stake, nor is it clear what goals U.S. troops would have in a mission there. Over the weekend the Administration had to re-consider the mission when Rwandan refugee began departing refugee camps in Zairewithout U.S. helpto head back to Rwanda; helping them make this trek was one of the goals of the U.S. intervention. The deeper problem in Zaire is that the government there is essentially non-existent, and if any intervention is going to have any long-term impact it will have to involve perilous and difficult "nation building." But that clearly is more than the American people will support; anything less thought is just a band aid. So why are American troops going to Zaire? And why aren't Republicans vocally opposing the idea?

<b>Newt: Should He Stay or Should He Go?</b><br>
	


The hot controversy inside Washington today was sparked by Kate O'Beirne's column in the current issue of <I>National Review</I> suggesting that perhaps it might be in the best interests of the Speaker Gingrich to temporarily step down from his leadership post, and if he did so a good replacement would be Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde. The column made ABC News, the <I>Washington Post</I>, the newspaper <I>Roll Call</I>,  and prompted remarks by Rep. Steve Largent (Okla.) that it might indeed be advisable for Newt to take a hiatus. Feelings against Gingrich do seem to run high among Republican freshmen who feel they were led astray by Gingrich over the last two years (many of them were shot at with bullets with Newt's name on them in the just-completed campaign). Also, the feeling that Gingrich has become a liability runs high among GOP opinion-makers in Washington, but until now has gone unspoken. The Gingrich forces were so worried about the stir that they reportedly called Hyde's office to see if he was collecting 
votes to challenge Gingrich in next week's internal Republican leadership elections. Such a challenge won't be forthcoming from Hyde, or anyone else for that matter. If Gingrich is going to go, he would indeed have to step aside voluntarily. But the Speaker is still in a precarious position. Yesterday liberal Republican Rep. Chris Shay (Conn.) announced he won't vote for Gingrich for Speaker in Januarythe public, official voteif the ethics committee report on Gingrich has not yet been made public. It seems a sensible demandbut, then again, Gingrich allies suggest this will only give Democrats on the committee reason to stall. Whatever happens, it will be a much reduced Speaker Newt Gingrich come the start of the new Congress, and Republicans have to be willing to think about the possibility in a few months of there being no Speaker Gingrich at all.

<b>Spare the Rod</b><br>
	
Conservative activist and strategist Jeff Bell's Parental Rights Amendment, which some social conservatives think of as a silver bullet, was tested in battle in Colorado on Tuesday. It lost, big. Bell explains that the PRA was unable to win any support from Colorado elites, including conservative elites. The Rocky Mountain News, Vincent Carroll, and Bill Armstrong all came out against it. Nobody with authority was willing to counter the canard that the PRA would license child abuse. (Although there really isn't any doubt on that score: previous legal findings of parental rights have had no problems distinguishing between legitimate parental authority and abuse.) Undecided voters tend to break against ballot initiatives; this conservative instinct was mobilized against a conservative reform. Still, Bell isn't too discouraged. He notes that term limits lost its first test, when Washington voters rejected it after a similarly alarmist and misleading campaign. (Washington was supposedly going to lose the benefits of seniority, and then California's delegation would take all its water rights away.) In any case, the point of the PRA campaign is not to win and generate litigation as much as it is to educate the public about the depredations of modern liberalism. The campaign, in other words, is the point. And the campaign continues

<b>NR Washington's Election Predictions</b><br>
	Pundits all around the country are weighing in with their election predictions, here is NR Washington's Stab at Prognostication:
<P>
	The Presidency: Bill Clinton, of course, wins in a walk, but a closer walk than people think. The president will be held below 50 per centprobably the 4748 rangedealing a blow to his plans to claim an election mandate (the press may well give him one anyway). Dole has been closing in recent days thanks to the Indonesian scandals. The word is that Dole internal polls have him within 6 points in California, which he must win if he is going to pull off his electoral-vote inside straight. But it's too late for him to win there. The campaign has also been taking heart from the Reuters/Zogby poll which has Dole down by just 4 point nationally. But most other tracking polls have Clinton up by 9-16 points, and with the President leading in Republican states like Arizona and Florida he is assured a very pleasant election evening. The Senate: Republicans gain two or three seats. Republicans will pick up seats in the South; they will certainly win the open Howell Heflin seat in Alabama, are likely to win the David Pryor seat in Louisiana, and have a chance to win Democratic open seats in Georgia (Republican Guy Millner has pulled even with Max Cleland) and Louisiana (Republican Woody Jenkins is tied with Mary Landrieu). Meanwhile, the only Republican incumbent who will lose is Sen. Larry Pressler who is trailing in South Dakota. Sen. Bob Smith will pull it out in New Hampshire, and Sen. Jesse Helms will be fine in North Carolina. Get ready for some more troops for Trent Lott (and they'll be more conservative too). The House: Republicans lose 5-7 seats tops and could even make some gains. The tide has clearly shifted the Republicans' way at the congressional level, thanks in part to a huge barrage of negative advertising against the Democrats. There are only 10 or so Republican freshmen who seem sure to lose. There are another nearly 30 seats where the Democrats have a chance, but these potential Democratic gains are easily offset by 10 Democratic seats where the GOP seems likely to make pick-ups and another roughly 20 where the Republicans have a chance. When all the dust settles the situation in the House will look much the way it does nowwith one important exception. By early summer, one way or another, Newt Gingrich will no longer be Speaker.

<b>"California Pandering"</b><br>
The <I>New York Times</I>'s latest insult to the intelligence of its readers was Thursday's editorial denouncing California's Proposition 209, the initiative to ban racial and gender preferences in state contracting, employment and university admissions. <I>The Times</I> complains that Bob Dole, "who voted for the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964, and a stream of race-conscious Federal laws since then, could now be heard complaining that all of these efforts, including many he had supported, had turned out to be a 'blind alley.' " We will eat an entire edition of the <I>Times</I> if Mr. Dole can be proved to have repudiated the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Notice also the slippery elision between that act and race-conscious laws that followed: some of the language, and the entire spirit, of Proposition 209 is borrowed from the 1964 act, which was a historic blow against "race consciousness." But it gets worse. The <I>Times</I> blasts Dole for having "tossed around code words like 'preferences' and 'quotas.' " Oh, so these things are figments of the right-wing imagination. (Have you noticed, by the way, that the word "liberal" increasingly appears in quote marks, as in "the 'liberal' Paul Wellstone," as if only a shameless partisan opponent would think to attach that label to moderates like the Senator from Minnesota?) Then we learn that "Proposition 209 is a retrograde measure that would deprive state authorities of what little leverage they have to promote true equality of opportunitya point President Clinton has grasped." These are the depths to which standards of argument have fallen at West 43rd St. Clinton is further congratulated for having "defused an angry national debate over affirmative action" with his " 'mend it, don't end it' policy." In fact, Clinton has done nothing to alter the practice of race and gender preferences, and his Justice Department has tried to extend them. "Mend it, don't end it" is a slogan, not a policy. But perhaps in the Clinton era, the <I>New York Times</I> can't tell the difference. 
<P>
<b>Affirmative Reaction</b><br>
The <I>New York Times</I> is on to something, though. The political battle over the California Civil Rights Initiative has featured a veritable avalanche of sleaze and misinformationall coming from its opponents. Take the new ad campaign against it. One ad features Candace Bergen saying, "If 209 passes, we could lose maternity benefits. . . . 209 will cut funding for rape crisis centers." In another, Bruce Springsteen exhorts the "working men and women" of California to vote against the proposition because it "will legalize discrimination against women and girls in jobs, in education, and in sports." Ellen De Generes's ad makes a bizarre link between the initiative and "the anti-choice boys" of "the religious right." A. Woodard appears in yet another ad quoting Gloria Steinem: "209 could wipe out maternity benefits." All these claims have something in common: they are lies, deliberate and utter fabrications. Bubble-headed Hollywood types may not know any better, but the people who write their lines surely do . The campaign to preserve race and gender preferences ought to be ashamed of itself. Here's hoping California voters won't be fooled. But if they are, it will not be proof that preferences are popular; it will be proof that they can only be sustained by a campaign of vicious demagoguery and simple lies.

<b>Holding The House and Senate?</b>
All right: here's some (possible) good news for a change. As of yet there's no sign of a national Democratic tide that would sweep the party back into control of the Senate and House. Although Republicans are still warily eyeing Clinton's final all-out campaign push, they are encouraged by trends in Senate and House races. In Senate races in Nebraska, Montana, and Iowa Republicans have made big gains in the last week in seats being defended by the Democrats. Presumablyalthough no one can say anything for surethe trend would be the opposite if Clinton were building a national Democratic wave. In the House the trend is similar. The kind of freshmen Democrats will have to beat to regain the majority have built leads over their opponents in recent weeks: Phil English and Jon Fox in Pennsylvania and Bob Ney, Steve Chabot and Steven La Tourette in Ohio. Republicans think a number of factors are working in their favor as the campaign draws to a close. 1) The message that Bill Clinton shouldn't be given a "blank check" with a Democratic Congressthe National Republican Campaign Committee is running ads to this effect in 50 House racesseems to be taking hold. 2) The continuing high-profile Asian fundraising scandal increases uneasiness with Clinton and supports the idea he can't be trusted with a Democratic Congress. 3) The Republican national committees are finally unleashing a tide of spending across the country, the National Rifle Association is kicking in a late $1.5 million independent expenditure, and Republican candidates have tended to save their resources, until now, for the final push. 4) The Christian Coalition will presumably be turning out voters big-time in an election everyone agrees will hinge largely on turn-out. 5) Perot seems to be gaining ground, and if his voters show up at the polls they will tend to vote for GOP congressional candidates. But Republicans should hold their breath until they actually cross the finish line. What they all dread is a smashing Clinton victory in the East, trumpeted by the networks around 8 p.m. eastern-time or so, which keeps Republicans away from the polls everywhere else. If that happens, despite everything, it might be time to start saying "Speaker Gephardt." (Uh, that's the bad news.)

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>1. Why does FRC exist and what do they stand 
for?</h2></center>

<p>

The Family Research Council's primary reason for existence is
to reaffirm and promote nationally and particularly in Washington,
DC, the traditional family unit and the Judeo-Christian principles
upon which it is built.  To accomplish this task we will:

<p><ul>

<li>Promote and defend the family in the media.
<li>Develop and advocate legislative and public policy initiatives
which strengthen and fortify the family and promote traditional
values.
<li>Establish and maintain an accurate source of statistical and
research information which reaffirms the importance of the family
in our civilization.
<li>Inform and educate citizens on how they can promote biblical
principles in our culture.

</ul><p>

<h3>FRC stands for:</h3>

<p><ol>

<b>The American Family</b>

<p>

<li>To ease growing economic pressures on families, federal and
state tax policy should allow parents raising children to keep
more of the money they earn.

<li>Fathers play an irreplaceable role in the upbringing of their
children.   They should take these responsibilities seriously.

<li>The natural, married-couple family is the best environment
to bear and raise children.  Public policy should protect the
two-parent family.

<li>America's child protection policies should be reformed to
be more sensitive to the rights of the parents.

<li>The best child care program is one a child receives in his
or her own home, from his or her own parents.  Congress and employers
should therefore adopt policies which make it easier for parents
to care for their own children.

<li>Adults should make every effort toward reconciliation before
considering divorce.  Congress and the state should encourage
this by limiting or repealing current &quot;no fault&quot; divorce
policies.

<p>

<b>The Preservation and Sanctity of Human Life</b>

<p>

<li>Human life is sacred and should be protected -- from conception
until natural death.

<li>Adoption should be strongly advocated, particularly as an
alternative to abortion.

<li>Taking organs from aborted children for experimental purposes
is morally repugnant.  The medial community should find alternatives
to this practice.

<p>

<b>Making our Schools Great Again</b>

<p>

<li>Parents should be free to direct their children's education;
government should respect the right of parents to choose safe and effective
schools for their children.

<li>A child's performance in school should be judged by academic
achievement, not whether the child becomes &quot;politically correct.&quot;

<li>Voluntary student-initiated prayer should be allowed in public
schools.

<li>Schools should teach abstinence before marriage and fidelity
within marriage, keeping in mind that parents bear the primary
responsibility for their children's sex education.

<p>

<b>Pro-Family Health Care Reform</b>

<p>

<li>America's health care system should be flexible enough to
meet each individual family's needs and should also respect the
right of each family to make its own health care choices.

<li>The best method for controlling the spread of AIDS is for
people to change their behavior, avoiding activities which would
put them at risk of acquiring the HIV virus.

<p>

<b>The Family and Society</b>

<p>

<li>Homosexual activity is immoral, unhealthy, and destructive
to individuals, families and societies.  Homosexuals should not
be granted special rights based on their sexual preference.  &quot;Gay
rights&quot; should not be equated with civil rights.

<li>Homosexuals should be treated with compassion, not bigotry.
We should provide support and healing for homosexuals who want
to change their way of life.

<li>It is destructive for military morale, readiness, and effectiveness
to permit homosexuals into the armed forces.

<p>

<b>Family</b>

<p>

<li>Tax dollars should not be used to fund obscene or indecent
art.

<li>It is essential that concerned citizens take part in the
political process, not just be passive observers.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>2. What does FRC think about AIDS funding?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that funding and AIDS prevention should be redirected
in ways commensurate with the threat to the entire population.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> AIDS is a serious threat that has already
claimed a quarter million lives.  However, it enjoys a much higher
share of available prevention, research and treatment dollars
than other equally devastating diseases, and this must change.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> In Fiscal Year 1996, the Department
of Health and Human Services will spend $5.35 billion directly
on AIDS, the highest per-victim expenditure for any of the nation's
10 most lethal diseases.

<p>

AIDS ranks near the bottom of the list of the top 10 mortal diseases
and last year accounted for about 42,000 deaths.  Meanwhile, heart
disease claimed 730,000 lives, and cancer killed 520,000.  Yet
this year, HHS will spend more on research for each AIDS death
($33,333) than for each death from heart disease ($1,201) or cancer
($4,615).

<p>

The point is not that AIDS should cease receiving serious attention.
HIV is a contagious and uniformly fatal disease, and its victims
deserve compassion and help.  Funding should continue for treatment,
prevention and care.  However, AIDS funding must be brought into
line with expenditures for other life-threatening diseases, and
the money must be redirected toward more effective approaches.

<p>

For many years, AIDS policy has been driven by the demands of
HIV-infected people who dominate AIDS organizations.  Their situations
are tragic, and their focus on finding a cure is understandable.
But because of their considerable influence, the lion's share
of AIDS funding has been spent for treatment of end-stage HIV
(AIDS) and not on the full spectrum of HIV disease.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Far more Americans die each year from cancer or
heart disease than AIDS.  Government should allocate resources
in proportion to the need.  To defeat the AIDS epidemic, government
must focus a larger share of AIDS funding on prevention.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>3. What does FRC think about adoption?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC encourages and promotes the adoption of children by two-parent
families as a superior alternative to abortion, out-of-wedlock
parenting, and foster care.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> (1) Passage of a $5,000 adoption tax credit
for couples who choose to adopt a child.  (2) Removal of policy
barriers which discourage interracial adoptions.  (3) Amendment
of the 1978 Indian Child Welfare Act so that Indian tribes would
no longer be able to retroactively overturn an adoption which
was approved by the child's biological parents.  (4) Encouragement
of crisis pregnancy centers, maternity homes, and family planning
clinics to provide adoption counseling for their unmarried pregnant
clients. (5) Shortening the time frame for biological parents
to make custodial claims so that children do not languish for
years in foster care, but are eligible for adoption sooner.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> Adoption typically provides children
with a permanent, stable, and loving home.  It helps to break
the cycles of illegitimacy, single parenthood, abortion, and welfare
dependency.  And for foster care children, adoption also acts
as a preventative measure against being involved in crime, being
incarcerated, or becoming welfare-dependent.

<p>

Public opinion polls show that the American people consistently
support the choice of adoption.  For example, the Family Research
Council's &quot;1995 Family Issues Survey&quot; found that, when
presented with four options to resolve out-of-wedlock pregnancies
(adoption, marriage to the birthfather, single parenthood, or
abortion), more respondents chose adoption as the best option
than any of the others.  In reality, however, 46 percent of all
nonmarital pregnancies in 1991 ended in induced abortion, 10 percent
ended in miscarriage, and 44 percent were carried to term, of
which only 2 percent were placed for adoption.  So while the number
of potentially adoptable children is theoretically large due to
the high number of out-of-wedlock births and crisis pregnancies,
there remains a relatively small number of adoptable children.
Consequently, an estimated one to two million prospective parents
are still waiting to adopt a child.

<p>

Currently, there are 500,000 children in foster care, only a portion
of whom are legally adoptable at any one time.  Of these foster
children, 50,000 who are &quot;free&quot; to be adopted remain
in foster care for months or years.  Furthermore, every year,
15,000 children &quot;graduate&quot; from the foster care system
by turning 18 with no permanent family.  That these children languish
in foster care year after year is primarily attributable to two
reasons:  (1) The overriding emphasis on race-matching the child
with his/her adoptive parents has often led to major delays or
denials of adoptions, even when transracial adoptive homes are
available; and (2) The foster care system places an undue, and
often misguided, emphasis on returning children to their biological
parents, even when there are clear indications that the biological
parents have forfeited their custodial claims by abusing or neglecting
their children.  Thus, these children languish in foster care
even when adoptive homes are available.  If they are finally released
for adoption, many of them are much harder to place because they
are older and have generally acquired more behavioral problems.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Adoption benefits everyone.  It benefits the young,
unmarried birthmother and her life chances to finish school and
escape the welfare-dependency cycle.  It meets the child's needs
for stability and has a positive effect on the child's physical,
emotional, and psychological health.  It benefits the adoptive
parents who desire to have a family.  It benefits American society
because the children are reared in solid, two-parent homes without
cost to the American taxpayer.  It also provides a superior alternative
to out-of-wedlock parenting and abortion.  By promoting and enabling
adoptions to occur more easily, more children will have the opportunity
to be raised in loving, two-parent homes rather than to suffer
the vagaries that come with being wards of the state through
foster care or welfare-dependency.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>4. What does FRC think about child care?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that federal child care policies must respect a range
of private choices without undermining intact families or placing
an undue tax burden on middle-class parents.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> Resistance to calls for the creation of
a new federal child care entitlement; protection of the voucher
provisions in the existing child care and child development block
grant (with the proviso that vouchers may be used at sectarian
institutions); passage of tax credits that do not discriminate
against either non-commercial care or one-career families.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> Federally-funded child care programs
are a staple of the liberal agenda to replace the nuclear family
with the total state.  It is no coincidence that the opening shot
in the political battle over the family was the passage in 1971
of Senator Walter Mondale's Comprehensive Child Development bill.
An archetype of liberal social engineering, the Mondale bill
sought to place as many children as possible under the care of
federally-funded child advocates and day care centers.  In his
veto message, President Nixon wrote that &quot;good public policy
requires that we enhance rather than diminish both parental authority
and parental involvement with children -- particularly in those
decisive early years when social attitudes and a conscience are
formed, and religious and moral principles are first inculcated.&quot;

<p>

While acknowledging that not all mothers can choose to stay at
home with children, contemporary child care policy must preserve
as many choices as possible -- including at-home care, church-based
care, and other informal arrangements.  Any expansion of federal
oversight, by definition, will limit options and pose regulatory
entanglements.  New federal funding will inflate the tax burden
on two-parent families and force many parents to spend more time
at the job site -- less time with the children.

<p>

Welfare reform that imposes stiff work requirements on mothers
of preschool children threatens to distort child care policy by
creating new sympathy for greater federal intrusion.  To reduce
the need for day care services -- and to assimilate welfare recipients
into the labor force more successfully -- welfare reform must
focus first on the mothers with older children in school.  Research
studies on various &quot;workfare&quot; experiments show a low
success rate for sustained employment by unmarried mothers with
preschool children, who face much greater role strain and task
overload than mothers with school-aged children.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> While decentralization ensures flexibility and
greater responsiveness to individual needs, vouchers ensure that
parents themselves retain maximum say in determining what is best
for their children.  Advocates of greater federal involvement
operate instead on the assumption that bureaucrats and licensed
&quot;experts&quot; know best.  Policymakers must acknowledge
that no paid worker can be an adequate substitute for a loving
parent -- and work to eliminate both the tax burden and the culture
of poverty that restrict families' economic freedom to care for
their own children.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>5. What does FRC think about China having &quot;most 
favored nation&quot; trade status?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that the United States should take a strong stand
against China's human rights violations and revoke their &quot;most
favored nation&quot; trade status.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> Revoke &quot;most favored nation&quot;
trade status for China.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> China's atrocious record on human
rights is indisputable.  Its blatant disregard for the sanctity
of human life has led to such abuses as the massacre of democracy-seekers
at Tiananmen Square, the exploitation of prisoners as slave laborers,
women being forcibly aborted or sterilized, female infanticide,
and the systematic intimidation, torture, and imprisonment of
Christians.

<p>

For the last 15 years, the United States has extended &quot;most
favored nation&quot; trade status to China.  Some have argued
that, by opening up our economic doors to China, the United States
will wield greater influence in reversing China's horrific human
rights record.  However, in the last 15 years, not even one of
these human rights abuses has been halted or abated.  Indeed,
China's human rights abuses have only worsened over that time,
and the Chinese government has grown more stubborn in its control-by-force
and intimidation tactics.

<p>

In addition to the myriad human rights abuses which alone should
disqualify China from receiving MFN status, in the last year alone
China has also threatened war with Taiwan, risking a military
confrontation with the United States; sold missiles and nuclear
technology to rogue nations (some of whom fund terrorists); and
balked at talks with the U.S. and South Korea.  Furthermore, because
the United States is currently running a $33.8 billion trade deficit
with China, there is reason to believe that revoking China's MFN
status may help to make an impact on China's leaders.

<p>

The Clinton administration has recently signaled that it will
extend MFN to China again this year.  Since the president will
not stand up to China, it will be up to Congress to pass legislation 
with a two-thirds majority in both Houses to overturn the president's 
decision by the end of August.  The oppressive nature of this Chinese 
government regime is well-known.  If the United States has not succeeded
in using the &quot;carrot&quot; of economic markets to encourage
China to meet a humane standard, then the &quot;stick&quot; should
be the revoking of China's trade privileges.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Revoking China's MFN trade status is a modest,
but significant step that the United States must take in order
to demonstrate tangibly that it will not tolerate the large-scale
human rights abuses taking place in China.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>6. What does FRC think about crime prevention?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC supports and encourages efforts to combat crime at all levels
to ensure that law-abiding Americans feel safe in our streets.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> (1) Sentencing and prison reform. (2) Reforms
in criminal procedure. (3) More aggressive enforcement.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b>

<p>

(1) <I>Sentencing and prison reform</I>:

<p>

Serious repeat violent felons must be put away permanently.  Recidivism
figures show clearly that many criminals, once released, return
to a life of crime.

<p>

Government must protect the public by keeping violent criminals
behind bars for their entire sentences and eliminating bail for
suspects.

<p>

Adolescents who commit &quot;adult&quot; crimes should be tried
as adults and subjected to adult penalties.

<p>

Criminals must be punished, not pampered.  Recidivism is high
among violent offenders partly because the price they pay for
crime is too low.

<p>

Other means of punishment, such as restitution, might be used
for less-serious offenses.  This could help relieve an overburdened
prison system.

<p>

No one advocates cruelty or harsh, meaningless labor such as the
old &quot;making little rocks out of big ones.&quot;  But prisons
should be places of punishment, not weight-lifting and entertainment
centers.

<p>

(2) <I>Reforms in criminal procedure</I>.

<p>

The death penalty, affirmed by the Supreme Court in 1976, must
be used where it is justified if it is to deter crime.

<p>

Habeas corpus loopholes that permit criminals to exploit the courts
must be closed.  The impact of the Comprehensive Terrorism Act
of 1995 must be carefully monitored to ensure that the loopholes
have been closed.

<p>

The exclusionary rule should be changed.  The exclusionary rule
was created by the courts to implement the Fourth Amendment (all
persons have the right to be secure from unreasonable searches
and seizures) thus protecting the public from police abuses. 
But the rule has been used to unfairly favor criminals.  It must
be modified to deny freedom to the guilty, give incentives for
police professionalism and protect civil liberties.

<p>

Jury reform is long overdue.  Jury members ought to be able to
ask questions that trial attorneys and prosecutors may miss. 
They should also be informed of the defendant's past criminal
history, especially during sentencing considerations where either
mitigating circumstances or a track record of incorrigible behavior
is significant.

<p>

(3) <I>More aggressive enforcement</I>.

<p>

Increase the prison population to reduce crime.  Statistics show
that most crime is committed by a core of chronic criminals. 
Keeping these criminals in jail for longer periods will make society
safer.

<p>

More local police -- to guard our schools, neighborhoods and commerce
-- are necessary to free our citizens to go about their daily
lives without fear.

<p>

Government must protect law-abiding citizens from recidivist sex
felons.  An example of this is the recently-passed &quot;Megan's
Law.&quot;*   It requires state governments to disclose information
and notify communities about convicted sex offenders who are released
from prison.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Crime costs America half-a-trillion dollars every
year.  It leaves thousands of killed and injured people in its
wake.  In order to prevent the next decade's much-anticipated
youth crime explosion, major anti-crime reform is desperately
needed.

<p>

* &quot;Megan's Law&quot; amends the Violent Crime Control and
Law Enforcement Act of 1994.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>7. What does FRC think about defunding public arts and 
humanities that support cultural decay?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that most of America's troubles stem more from moral
decline than from economic problems.  Part of FRC's goal is to
spark a cultural renewal that will be evident in music, arts,
literature, film, television, and other parts of our culture.
FRC believes there should be an end to taxpayer funding of public
arts and humanities and broadcast programs that attack the family,
religion and traditional values, and/or promote an ideological
agenda.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b>  Defunding the National Endowment for the
Arts (NEA), the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), and
the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB).

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> The National Endowment for the
Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities began in 1965
with budgets of $2.5 million.  The two agencies' budgets reached
more than $175 million each per year in the 1990s.  NEA was cut
to just under $100 million in fiscal 1996,  to be phased out after
1997.  NEH was cut to $110 million in fiscal 1996, with a planned
phaseout after 1998.

<p>

Unlike any other arts sponsor, the federal government has unique
authority and responsibility.  A federal grant instantly conveys
the stamp of approval of the federal government and the American
people.

<p>

Federal arts funding, an unconstitutional expansion of government 
power, has skewed the art market toward questionable projects.
NEA continues to fund such venues as the Franklin Furnace Archive
theater in New York, where artists engage in scatological, sexually-explicit,
anti-religious and anti-family &quot;performance&quot; works.
NEA Chairwoman Jane Alexander told the pro-gay <I>Advocate</I> magazine
that she intended to use the NEA to &quot;introduce people gently
to gay themes all across the country.  And I mean gently, because
if you start with a very overt thing, people get scared.&quot;
Alexander also defended a performance at an NEA-funded art center
in which an HIV-positive man sliced another man's back with a
knife, mopped up blood and sent it over the audience on clotheslines.

<p>

At the NEH,  money has been wasted on politically correct projects
such as the promotion of &quot;cultural diversity&quot; and the
&quot;National Conversation on American Pluralism and Identity.&quot;
When one activist used the latter forum to state that, &quot;There
is nothing about me that is American.  I don't want to be an American,&quot;
NEH Director Sheldon Hackney exulted, &quot;What an American thing
to say -- squarely in the great tradition of American dissent.&quot;

<p>

In 1967, Congress created the Corporation for Public Broadcasting,
overseer of the Public Broadcasting Service and National Public
Radio.  CPB's budget grew to nearly $285 million by fiscal 1996.
In fiscal 1997, CPB is to receive $260 million, with a request
for $296.4 million for 1998.  No phaseout has been enacted.

<p>

America has more than 11,700 radio stations, 3,100 television
licensees, 109 cable networks and another 6,963 translators and
boosters, plus the Internet. There is no reason to tax hardworking
American families to subsidize PBS or NPR shows.  Although PBS
and NPR have some worthy fare, there is a drumbeat of anti-family
and anti-religious programming.  Political bias is rampant.

<p>

CPB subsidies are not needed.  <I>Sesame Street</I> can make it
on its own, while bad programs would and should fail in an open
market.  Some congressmen have talked about creating a $1 billion
trust fund for PBS without any congressional oversight.  More

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>8. What is FRC's stand on divorce reform?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes there needs to be revisions in public policy that
would increase the commitment of society to the institution of
marriage, the protection of children and justice for innocent
parties.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> Reform of the current no-fault divorce
laws in every state by establishing fault for grounds and dissolution
where there is no mutual consent.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> The current situation began in
1969 when California passed the first &quot;no-fault&quot; divorce
law.  Intended to remove animosity during divorce, reduce perjury
and collusion, establish standards for alimony and property awards
and give relief to marital conflict, no-fault laws passed in 45
states in the next five years.  By 1985, all 50 states had passed
laws establishing no-fault divorce.

<p>

What have been the results of such a significant shift in the
way that we view the marriage contract?  We have shifted from
a culture of marriage to a culture of divorce.  Divorce rates
have surged 34 percent from 1970 to 1990.  It is estimated that
one half of all new marriages will end in divorce.  The United
States is the divorce leader of the industrialized world.  What
are we communicating when it is easier to divorce your wife of
25 years that it is to let go that employee you hired two weeks
ago?

<p>

More specifically, no-fault divorce has had a detrimental affect
on the innocent parties involved, especially the children.  No-fault
divorce reduces the protection and negotiating rights of the spouse
who wants to maintain the marriage.  Divorced women experience
a 30 percent drop in income the first year after a divorce.  Three
out of four teen suicides are committed by children from broken
homes.  Children of divorce are also 70 percent more likely to
have been expelled or suspended from school, and are twice as
likely to drop out of school.  Of juveniles and young adults serving
time in long-term correctional facilities, 70 percent came from
broken homes.

<p>

No-fault divorce has not only added to societal problems, but
it has not remotely addressed the problems it originally set out
to solve.  Animosity during divorce has simply shifted to animosity
during the settlement.  Fights over custody and support are more
prevalent today and just as humiliating as those over grounds.
In the overwhelming majority of cases before the adoption of
no-fault grounds, there was no litigation at all, let alone hostile
litigation.  Perjury and collusion have also just shifted from
the grounds arena to the collateral arenas of custody and visitation.

<p>

Dr. Allen Parkman has summed it up this way:  &quot;Seldom in
U.S. history have laws been enacted with higher hopes and poorer
results than the no-fault divorce statutes.&quot;  Not surprisingly,
in a recent FRC survey, by a margin of 55 percent to 31 percent,
Americans said that they favor divorce reform to strengthen the
rights of spouses who want to save their marriage.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Divorce reform will strengthen our families and
society by increasing the incentive for spouses to invest in their
marriage.  It will offer justice for those who are unwilling parties
of divorce, especially for any children involved.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>9. What national drug abuse policies does FRC 
support?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that:

<p><ol>

<li>The President must give the drug war a high priority.
<li>Congress must hold federal drug spending at current levels
until there is strict accountability, and then consider increasing
budget authority.
<li>The drug czar must be made subordinate to the attorney general
to coordinate all drug interdiction.
<li>Local communities must be allowed to tailor treatment and
prevention programs to local needs.

</ol><p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> America has successfully cut drug
abuse in half since 1979, but now it is rising again and emboldened
drug legalization proponents are calling for a surrender in the
drug war.  The drug war needs leadership, a unified national interdiction
effort, and a local prevention and treatment focus.

<p>

The absence of committed Presidential leadership has contributed
to the problem. President Clinton has been virtually silent about
drug abuse.  He has mentioned drugs in less than three percent
of the public speeches made during the first three years of his
administration.

<p>

The lack of Presidential attention to this issue tracks with a
growing view that illegal drugs are less dangerous and more acceptable.
This shift can be attributed to fewer news stories about the
risks of drugs, more pro-drug information, more legalization discussions,
and glamorization of drugs by pop culture.  In fact, last year,
the major television networks ran only 40 drug stories compared
to nearly 400 per year during the Reagan administration.

<p>

Drug abuse costs the nation perhaps half-a-trillion dollars annually.
The federal government will spend $13 billion fighting the drug
war this year, but much of this money will be spent without close
accountability.  This must change.

<p>

The federal drug effort is complicated by too many programs. 
There are 140 federal programs each with its own bureaucracy and
tangled set of procedures.  This scattershot approach isn't working.
The federal part of the war must focus on interdiction and turn
the rest over to local communities.

<p>

The drug czar should be subordinate to the attorney general just
as the surgeon general falls under the Secretary of Health and
Human Services.  That would eliminate redundancies and improve
the use of taxpayer dollars.  The drug czar should coordinate
the U.S. drug interdiction effort and speak out against abuse.

<p>

Other than the President providing the vision for a drug-free
America, drug treatment and prevention are issues the federal
government is poorly equipped to handle.  Consolidate federal
drug bureaucracies, streamline procedures and send authority and
resources to the local level.  Local communities working with
citizen-run groups can do a far better job than the federal government
at tailoring programs to meet local needs.

<p>

Include faith-based programs in the local solution and take steps
to ensure that government does not interfere in their religious
mission.  They have a proven record of long-term drug abuse recovery
and prevention effectiveness.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Drug abuse ruins lives, acts as a drag on our
economy, damages every American's quality of life via drug-related
crime, and robs America of its intellectual edge in a competitive
world.  This is a national crisis and deserves top priority.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>10. How does FRC believe we can improve the public education
system in America?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that America must restore decision-making authority
over school policy and finance to parents, locally elected school
boards and taxpayers, relieving them of the layers of bureaucracy
that hinder education renewal.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> The federal role in education, now amounting
to several hundred programs, should be terminated and the billions
of dollars spent annually returned to taxpayers.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> Education has been traditionally
-- and constitutionally -- a responsibility of states and localities.
But since the U.S. Education Department was created in 1979,
it has followed the iron law of bureaucracies, seeking to expand
its range and influence.  Today, more than 760 education programs
exist in 39 federal agencies, totalling $120 billion in annual
expenditures.

<p>

A new height of federal intrusion into local education was reached
with the passage of Goals 2000 in 1994.  Goals 2000 prescribes
to states how they will run their educational systems and meddles
in their curricular issues by creating national standards and
assessments.  But Goals 2000 also pushes a liberal social agenda,
covering everything from prenatal health care systems to mandatory
community service to comprehensive health education.

<p>

Goals 2000 must be repealed as the first step toward restoring
local schools in America.  Republicans in the 104th Congress demonstrated
their commitment to eliminating wasteful, inappropriate federal
programs and to improving education by seeking to end Goals 2000.
The House voted to eliminate funding for the program in FY '96,
and the House Budget Committee resolved to do so again for FY '97.

<p>

As control has been seized by the centralized education bureaucracy,
local apathy has increased, just as Alexis de Tocqueville predicted
over 150 years ago.  Liberals seek to dictate parental and community
involvement in education through federal law, ignoring the fact
that their own cumbersome programs choke off any meaningful participation.

<p>

Only when the federal role in education is ended will we see a
revitalization of the community involvement that characterized
schools before the advent of the education bureaucracy.   The
proposal to free schools from federal control received a hearty
response in the 104th Congress, where some 120 members of the
House sponsored the Back-to-Basics bill, the first concerted effort
to shut down the U.S. Education Department bureaucracy in the
last decade.

<p>

As part of their freedom to participate fully in their children's
education, parents should be permitted to choose a safe and effective
public, private, religious or home school.  When parents freely
choose the kind of education they seek for their children, employers
will get the qualified employees they want, and policymakers will
see the healthy schools they envision coming to life as a result
of competition.

<p>

Blaise Pascal told us that seeking to obtain by one means what
can only be achieved by another is tyranny.  We have witnessed
in the past three decades an ever-expanding attempt to solve educational
problems from Washington, D.C.  The resulting nationalization
of education has only exacerbated the problems of local schools.
Parents, teachers and schools must be freed from the burdens
of the federal education bureaucracy.  Only then will America
experience the educational renewal that will keep this nation
a leader in the 21st century world.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> The elimination of the federal role in education
will allow state and local education to flourish without regulatory
bondage, reestablish the authority of parents and taxpayers over
education, and bring about the education renewal parents desire
and their children need for future success.  Tax relief will allow
families to increase their buying power for current educational
services and to save for future educational needs.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>11. What solutions does FRC see for affordable health 
care?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that families should have access to affordable, portable
health care and insurance for families.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> Enactment of tax-free medical savings accounts
(MSAs) as an important cost-saving and freedom-of-choice component
of any health care reform measure.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> A radical overhaul of our nation's
health care system, which is one of the finest in the world, is
not necessary.  Rather, there are certain aspects, such as affordability
and portability, that are amenable to reform without inviting
wholesale federal interference in health care.  Tax-free medical
savings accounts (MSAs) for working families and individuals,
as passed in the House-Senate Balanced Budget Act and the House
health care reform package, constitute one such reform.  MSAs
are similar to IRAs in that pre-tax dollars up to a certain limit
may be set aside for certain medical expenses.  MSAs are controlled
by individuals and families, not by governments or insurance companies.
MSAs usually supplement high-deductible (catastrophic) health
insurance coverage, helping to cover lower-level medical expenses
before the insurance deductible is reached, co-payments, and other
qualified expenses.  Because families and individuals are directly
responsible for the use of their health care dollars, MSAs guard
against the overutilization of health care services, thereby helping
to curb skyrocketing health care costs.  Moreover, families reap
the rewards of managing their health care dollars wisely and of
practicing good health habits, for any monies not spent by the
end of the year may be kept by the individual as taxable income,
or kept in the account for future health care needs.  Since most
individuals spend less than $2,000 per year on medical expenses,
funds in the account would be portable and available in-between
jobs, at the next job, or when bigger unexpected medical costs
come up in the future.

<p>

Companies that offer MSAs have found that they are most popular
among lower-income families.  Under conventional insurance plans,
low-income employees typically have to meet their $250 or $500
deductible with after-tax dollars before they can access their
insurance.  A single mother earning $14,000 or $15,000 a year
may find it difficult to meet the deductible when rent, transportation,
taxes, grocery bills and other needs for her children are pressing.
An MSA allows these low-income earners first dollar coverage,
permitting them to get medical care when they or their children
need it.  This feature alone could significantly reduce 
the level of emergency room utilization for non-emergency care.
Low-income wage earners would have, in effect, first-dollar coverage
for medical care up to the amount in their MSA.

<p>

MSAs also promote greater autonomy in health care choices.  Because
MSA funds may be used toward any medical expenses, including those
not expressly covered within the insurance policy, a family has
more flexibility to choose health services and providers and has
more portability of coverage.

<p>

More and more private sector employers are offering MSAs to their
employees, with great response, even though our federal tax code
discriminates against this practice.  Fifteen states have passed
laws granting favorable tax treatment to MSAs.   In March 1996,
the House of Representatives passed an MSA provision that would
allow comparable tax treatment to other forms of employment-based
insurance, as part of their health care reform package, H.R. 3103.
A similar Senate bill, S. 1028, did not contain an MSA provision
so this issue must be worked out in a House-Senate conference
committee.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> MSAs empower families to make their own health
care decisions by choosing their own doctors and spending their
own money for such care.   MSAs are a bipartisan solution and
a practical free-market alternative to address the problems of
escalating health care costs and lack of portability between jobs.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>12. What is FRC's response to the homosexual 
agenda?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that homosexuality is unhealthy, immoral and destructive
to individuals, families and societies.  <I>Compassion</I> --
not bigotry -- impels us to support healing for homosexuals who
want to change their orientation.

<p>

FRC opposes any attempts to equate homosexuality with civil rights
or to compare it to benign characteristics such as skin color
or place of origin.

<p>

The Family Research Council opposes sex education programs that
treat homosexuality and heterosexuality as equally desirable,
that teach that any sexual behavior between consenting people
is a human right, and that idealize homosexuality and the homosexual
lifestyle.  FRC also opposes attempts to make the adoption of
children by homosexuals an accepted practice.

<p>

Much of the data used to support claims by homosexual activists
is flawed:  the debate has been clouded by faulty research and
surveys taken out of context.  FRC supports efforts to promote
public policy -- based on scholarly research -- that undergirds
traditional values and families, rather than attempts to provide
special treatment for homosexuals.  The Family Research Council
applauds the efforts of men and women who provide counseling and
support for people who wish to leave the homosexual lifestyle
and find fulfillment in a healthy lifestyle.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>13. What is FRC's position on the military's homosexual 
ban?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that the military should enforce the law  [10 U.S.C.
&#167; 654] that denies military service to homosexuals.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> Rewrite the Pentagon's inconsistent method of 
implementing regulations which ignore the law's intent to deny service to 
homosexuals. Additionally, reinstate the question asking if a candidate 
is a homosexual, which the law permits to be asked of all recruits.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> In 1993, Congress held hearings to determine
whether to keep the military's 200-year-old homosexual ban.  Experts
testified that homosexuals threaten unit cohesion and morale --
key combat components.  Their defining behavior is illegal in
the military, and as a category homosexuals create an unacceptable
health risk to themselves and others.  Science has found that
homosexuals experience higher rates of sexually transmitted diseases,
including the AIDS virus, and higher rates of drug abuse than
heterosexuals.

<p>

On November 30, 1993, President Clinton signed into law the military's
long-standing ban on homosexual military service.  The law [ 10
U.S.C. &#167; 654] Congress passed is very clear: no homosexuals
in the military.  But this binding expression of the will of the
American people has not stopped the Clinton administration from
creating regulatory loopholes through which homosexuals not only
serve, but serve openly in the military.  This end run around
Congress has not gone unnoticed.

<p>

This spring, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit
in <I>Thomasson v. Perry</I> identified the regulatory loopholes.
In this case, a homosexual sailor challenged both the law passed
by Congress and the Clinton administration regulations on homosexuals
in the military.  Six of that court's judges declared that the
administration deliberately mischaracterized the law and deliberately
shaded its answers to Congress when concerned members tried to
pin down exactly what the White House was up to in regard to 
&quot;implementing&quot; the law on homosexuals in the military.

<p>

Besides revising the regulations to be consistent with the law,
the services must also return to asking recruits about their sexual
orientation and past homosexual conduct. Asking the questions
kept honest homosexuals out and sent a clear message that to serve,
others must keep their homosexuality a secret.  In 1993, the Clinton
administration ordered this practice stopped.  The new law, however,
permits the Secretary of Defense to reinstate the questions. 
Asking new recruits and those reenlisting is a prudent step to
warn would-be service members that homosexuals are not eligible
for service in the military.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> The law and the regulations are inconsistent.
This undercuts the constitutional authority of Congress to set
the rules and regulations for the military and puts the courts
in the position of having to force the executive branch to do
its constitutional duty to &quot;faithfully execute the laws&quot;
of the land.  Rewriting the regulations will result in the restoration
of a consistent policy that will survive constitutional challenge,
avert the manifold medical and morale-related problems occasioned
by the Clinton administration's social experimentation, and put
to rest an issue that has disrupted the clear and workable policy
that served the nation well for generations.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>14. What does FRC think can be done to restore the sanctity
of human life?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that society must acknowledge and restore the sanctity
of human life for those born and unborn.  Society must protect
innocent unborn children and mothers facing a crisis pregnancy
from government funding and promotion of abortion in the U.S.
and abroad, and protect the elderly from physician-assisted suicide
and euthanasia.  We can accomplish these goals through various
protective measures through all branches of government:  executive,
legislative, and judicial.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> Enactment of specific pro-life legislation,
such as the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act and other measures
that protect unborn children from abortion, reduce the overall
number of abortions, and restrict taxpayer funding and sponsorship
of abortion.  Encouraging the President to appoint, and the Senate
to confirm, pro-family judges who believe that unborn children
have an inalienable right to life and deserve full legal protection.
Adopt a human life amendment to the Constitution.  Encourage
policies to restrict physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> Thomas Jefferson said:  &quot;The
protection of human life and happiness, and not their destruction,
is the first and only legitimate object of good government.&quot;
However, the unborn child is not considered a &quot;person&quot;
according to seven members of the Supreme Court in the <I>Roe
v. Wade</I> decision (1973).  Since the legalization of abortion
through all nine months of pregnancy in 1973, there have been
more than 33 million abortions.  One-third of these were performed
on teenage girls.  Out-of-wedlock pregnancies, sexually-transmitted
diseases [particularly chlamydia, syphilis, human papillomarvirus
(HPV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)], and abortion rates
have all dramatically increased since that time.  Abortion is
never a healthy solution to a problem pregnancy.  To that end,
government and, principally, communities and churches, must encourage
and promote public policies and programs that reduce the demand
for, and total numbers of, abortions; promote adoption; promote
parental involvement; and offer practical assistance to teens
and women in a crisis situation.  Our tax dollars should never
fund or actively encourage abortions using taxpayer dollars or
fund organizations with pro-abortion policy goals or objectives.

<p>

Opinion polls consistently show that the majority of Americans
oppose most abortions.  A 1994 Gallup poll commissioned by CNN
and <I>USA Today</I> found that 65 percent of Americans believe
that abortion should either be &quot;illegal in all circumstances&quot;
or &quot;legal under certain circumstances.&quot;  A January 1995
CBS/<I>New York Times</I> poll found that 60 percent believe that
abortion should either &quot;not be permitted&quot; or have &quot;stricter
limits.&quot;

<p>

Specifically, the president should sign the Partial-Birth Abortion
Ban Act, a bill that would limit a particularly horrible late-term
abortion method that is basically infanticide.  Congress should
adopt, and send to the states for ratification, a human life amendment
that applies the protection of the 14th Amendment to unborn children
and assures recognition of their fundamental, individual right
to life.  In addition, various government agencies, such as the
Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of
Health, Department of Education, State Department, and Agency
for International Development must not indirectly or directly
fund or encourage abortions, fund domestic or international organizations
that promote or perform abortion as a method of family planning,
fund &quot;comprehensive&quot; school-based health clinics, fund
or encourage abortion-related research on drugs like RU-486, or
promote or fund physician-assisted suicide and euthanasia.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Promoting the sanctity of human life is vital
to maintaining a great nation and strong civil society.  We see
in alarming crime rates and shocking killings the inevitable result
of abortion cheapening human life.  Society and political parties
must recognize the value and inherent worth of each individual
person from the moment of conception to natural death.  Unborn
children, the infirm, the handicapped and the elderly must all
be protected.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>15. How does FRC view immigration reform?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that the immigration laws should reflect this country's
heritage as a &quot;nation of immigrants&quot; while also placing
emphasis on fairness and orderly procedure, recognizing that regulation
is necessary to protect our national sovereignty.

<p>

<b>Actions Needed:</b> (1) Support measures which halt illegal
immigration, e.g., increasing border patrols, halting welfare
payments to illegal aliens, permanently denying readmission to
aliens who are caught illegally residing in the U.S., etc.  (2)
Support pro-family measures regarding legal immigration, e.g.,
reuniting nuclear families first before other family and work
categories, enforcing policies which hold U.S. citizens and residents
financially responsible for the family member(s) they &quot;sponsor&quot;
for entry into the U.S., deporting and permanently excluding aliens
who have been convicted of an aggravated felony, and providing
asylum to victims of religious persecution and/or coercive population
control policies.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> Immigration reform is badly needed
in order to correct the unwise policies of the past (i.e., providing
amnesty to all illegal aliens) and to provide a framework to meet
present and future challenges, especially those which address
the ever-growing problem of illegal aliens crossing into the U.S.

<p>

The problem of illegal immigration must be addressed on the principles
of ensuring adherence to the law and administering justice.  The
United States must not reward illegal aliens whose first act in
this country is to break the law.  Thus, we support efforts to
halt illegal immigration by increasing border patrols, enforcing
the expedited deportation of illegal aliens, increasing criminal
penalties for those who create or distribute fraudulent identification
documents, and permanently denying readmission to aliens who are
found to illegally reside in the U.S., among others.

<p>

In terms of legal immigration, the United States should preserve
its policy of welcoming legal immigrants, acknowledging the fact
that we are a &quot;nation of immigrants.&quot;  However, in recent
years, public opinion has been antagonistic towards immigrants
-- both legal and illegal -- due to the influx of illegal immigrants
and the notion that legal immigrants are not &quot;paying their
own way&quot; once they enter the U.S.  Thus, we support policies
which help legal immigrants &quot;play by the rules,&quot; such
as deporting and permanently excluding aliens who are convicted
of felonies, and enforcing &quot;sponsorship&quot; policies which
hold U.S. family members financially responsible for those immigrants
they sponsor to enter the U.S.

<p>

Finally, the United States must preserve its commitment to refugees,
particularly those who are victims of religious persecution or
coercive population control policies.  We support current U.S.
policy which does not impose a numerical limit on refugees because
America needs the flexibility to respond appropriately to future
humanitarian crises and because refugees currently comprise only
about 8 percent of total immigration to the U.S. every year. 
Most important of all, the United States must maintain its tradition
of moral leadership, reminding other nations that adherence to
universally-recognized human rights matters.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> The American people already want immigration reform.
Implementing wise immigration reform policies -- halting illegal
immigration and regulating legal immigration -- will be vital
in order to restore Americans' confidence in the immigration system
as well as in changing the current negative public perception
about immigrants as a whole.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>16. What is FRC's position on the Legal Services 
Corporation?</h2></center>

<p>

To protect American families and businesses from frivolous, damaging
litigation and to end the annual waste of millions in taxpayer
dollars, FRC believes that the Legal Services Corporation should
be defunded.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> The complete defunding of the Legal Services
Corporation.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> The Legal Services Corporation
was founded in 1965 with the purpose of expanding welfare benefits
to the poor through test cases and impact litigation.  That and
much more occurred as the program was commandeered by left-wing
lawyers with anti-family agendas.

<p>

The family is the foundation of society, yet in case after case
LSC has attempted to make the individual, instead of the family,
the basic unit of welfare policy.  This goal undermines the family
by replacing parents (especially fathers) with welfare programs
and discouraging self-reliance in favor of federally-funded dependency.

<p>

Examples of legal services' hostility to the family are legion.
They include:

<p><ul>

<li>In 1994, the National Center for Youth Law, a major LSC grantee,
played a key role in overturning California's parental consent
law on abortion.

<p>

<li>In 1993, Karla and Leland Swenson were forced to sell their
home to fight the Idaho Legal Aid Society's effort to seek custody
of their adopted son for the sister of the boy's biological father.
Neither of the boy's biological parents was seeking custody.

<p>

<li>In 1995, Lehigh Valley Legal Services of Pennsylvania tried
to give a teenage rapist custody of a child he fathered by his
rape of a 13-year-old even though a psychologist concluded he
would endanger the child.

<p>

<li>Also in 1995, Legal Services of Greater Miami joined forces
with the ACLU and homosexual activists to fight for a homosexual
couple's bid to adopt a child.

</ul><p>

Congress has already called for LSC's phasing out by 1998, starting
with a 30 percent funding cut for fiscal 1996 from $400 million
to $283.5 million.  In addition, several restrictions have been
placed on LSC, prohibiting its grantees from filing class-action
lawsuits except with the approval of the Corporation.

<p>

Legal services lawyers will no longer be allowed to represent
prisoners, illegal aliens, and public housing residents being
evicted for drug-related crimes.

<p>

Unfortunately, restrictions can be circumvented.  Several grantees
have already set up new groups to receive LSC grants while using
non-federal or private grants to carry out continued assaults
on the family.  The inclusion of the Cohen amendment in the omnibus
spending bill was a victory for LSC.  It allows grantees to comment
on legislation as well as become involved in legislative rulemaking
-- a major loophole for legal services lawyers to engage in lobbying
activities.  As these incidents show, nothing short of the outright
abolition of LSC will solve the problem.

<p>

The private bar can and must assume responsibility for meeting
the needs of poor Americans for legal services not covered by
public defender programs across the United States.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Defunding the Legal Services Corporation will
provide protection to the American family, slow the expansion
of the welfare state, and cut federal spending by billions of
dollars over the long-term.  It will help get politically-motivated
&quot;public interest&quot; lawyers off Americans' backs and shift
power and money back to local governments -- and the American
people.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>17. What is FRC's opinion on the redefinition of 
marriage?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC opposes the radical redefinition of marriage and the erosion
of societal protections for marriage.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b>  Passage of the federal Defense of Marriage
Act (DOMA), continued enactment of state laws that define marriage
as the union of one man and one woman, and resistance to the institution
of  &quot;domestic partnership&quot; benefits and privileges to
same-sex or unmarried couples.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b>  Because of its crucial role, marriage
has a special status within the culture and the law.  Its essence
-- the joining of one man and one woman in a uniquely exclusive
legal, sexual, economic and spiritual bond with the procreation
of children as a desirable and common result -- had not been seriously
challenged for thousands of years.

<p>

Now, homosexual activists are on the verge of radically redefining
marriage and family through judicial fiat.  If they succeed, all
distinctions based on sex will fall, and the worst aspects of
the rejected Equal Rights Amendment will be imposed.  Homosexuals
will gain the &quot;right&quot; to adopt children; schoolchildren
will be taught that homosexual sex is the equivalent of marital
love between husband and wife; employers will be forced to subsidize
homosexual relationships; churches will be pushed outside the
civil law; and government power will be directed against anyone
who believes that homosexuality is wrong.  Likewise, any government
institution of  &quot;domestic partnerships&quot; will harm the
moral order by raising homosexuality and fornication to protected
status, thereby undercutting societal support for marriage.

<p>

In August, a Hawaiian court is expected to strike down that state's
law limiting marriage to &quot;one man and one woman.&quot;  
Despite widespread opposition within Hawaii (recent polls show
that 74 percent of Hawaiians reject same-sex &quot;marriage&quot;)
homosexual activists hope to impose their agenda through compliant
courts.  Because the U.S. Constitution's Full Faith and Credit
Clause calls for states to honor each other's licenses, homosexuals
are planning to fly to Hawaii, &quot;marry,&quot; and return to
the mainland to claim &quot;married&quot; status.  More than 30
states now have efforts underway to protect marriage, and nine
-- Alaska, Arizona, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Kansas, Oklahoma,
South Dakota and Utah -- have enacted laws protecting marriage.

<p>

At the national level, DOMA would protect the military, Social
Security and all federal agencies from radical redefinition of
wedlock, as well as protect states from having their marriage
laws invalidated by an adverse court ruling or enactment in another
state.

<p>

The marriage battle is being fought while several key cases involving
the homosexual agenda are being decided.  The Supreme Court recently
struck down a voter-approved Colorado state constitutional amendment 
to bar any city or county from enacting special rights
based on sexual orientation.  Several cases challenging the military's
ban on homosexuality are being heard around the nation.  In Georgia,
a federal appeals court ruled in favor of a lesbian fired from
her job at the state attorney general's office after she announced
that she had  &quot;married&quot; her lover.  In New York, the
state's high court opened adoption proceedings to homosexual couples
and unmarried heterosexual couples, thus devaluing marriage and
jeopardizing children.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> If marriage is radically redefined, or domestic
partnerships instituted, the entire moral code will unravel. 
Polls show that the American people overwhelmingly expect public
officials to defend marriage unequivocally.  This effort can advance
the cause of judicial reform, halt the judicial assault on traditional
morality and stall the homosexual activist agenda, which has gone
far beyond mere &quot;tolerance.&quot;

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>18. What does FRC do to support military families?
</h2></center>

<p>

FRC created the Military Readiness Project (MRP) to oppose the
induction of homosexuals into the military because their known
presence destroys morale and personal privacy and introduces sexual
tension into the barracks.  FRC opposes attempts to subvert the
law barring anyone with homosexual &quot;propensities&quot; from
military service.  The MRP has been actively engaged in providing
&quot;friend of the court&quot; briefs in key federal court cases
dealing with this issue.

<p>

The Family Research Council believes in the unique gifts and capabilities
of women, and opposes the pitfalls of a military that is gender
blind.  Some combat exemptions have already been eliminated, but
if the erosion continues, women may be placed in direct combat
roles &quot;on the same terms as men,&quot; a position supported
by barely a quarter of the American people.  The country -- and
its women -- are not well-served by placing women in combat positions.
FRC has worked hard to maintain a combat exemption in today's
military.

<p>

FRC has also tackled the issue of pornographic materials sold
in taxpayer-supported military stores.  The Family Research Council
sees this practice as one that undermines military discipline
and is at odds with the fundamentals of leadership and service.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<center><h2>19. How does FRC view the rights and responsibilities 
of parents?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that the rights of parents to direct the upbringing
and education of their children without unwarranted interference
from the government should be protected.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> Statutory recognition of the fundamental
right of parents to direct the upbringing and education of their
children.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> The past century has witnessed
a subtle shift in the role of child rearing from a private matter
to a matter of increasingly public concern.  At the turn of the
century, courts began to examine and uphold state compulsory education
laws; today, government bureaucrats display an arrogant &quot;we
know best&quot; attitude that manifests itself in such ways as
compulsory-attendance, value-free sex education classes for elementary
school children.

<p>

While the Constitution does not explicitly address the parent-child
relationship, the Supreme Court has historically regarded the
right of parents to direct the upbringing and education of their
children as a fundamental right under the Fourteenth Amendment.
In the 1920s, the Supreme Court affirmed its high regard for
the integrity of the parent-child relationship in two landmark
cases:  <I>Meyer v. Nebraska</I> and <I>Pierce v. Society of Sisters</I>.
In <I>Meyer</I>, the Court stated that the liberty guaranteed
by the Fourteenth Amendment denotes &quot;the right of the individual
to marry, establish a home and bring up children.&quot;  The Court
declared in <I>Pierce</I> that the child is not a mere creature
of the state, and that &quot;those who nurture him and direct
his destiny have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize
and prepare him for additional obligations.&quot;

<p>

A new law is needed because although the Supreme Court's intent
to protect parental rights is unquestionable, lower courts have
not always followed the Supreme Court's strong mandate for the
parent-child relationship.  For example, parents from Falmouth,
Massachusetts recently lost a case in which they challenged their
school board's installation of condom machines in high school
bathrooms and school-nurse distribution of condoms to junior high
schoolers. Many public schools conduct psychological testing of
children under the guise of standardized &quot;tests&quot; and
&quot;surveys&quot; without parental consent.  Court challenges
to these policies have been met with mixed results.  Parents in Georgia
are fighting a legal battle against school administrators who
drove their daughters to a health clinic for gynecological tests
and birth control prescriptions without notification or consent.

<p>

The legal recognition of parental rights is also a children's
rights issue, because a child's first and most important right
is to have a parent who is in charge of raising him or her with
love and direction.  To say that parents have the primary role
in raising children is to say that parents are irreplaceable.
Stable, intact families rearing children with both love and direction
have never been in shorter supply or more desperately needed.
Parents need the legal standing to defend their fundamental right
to direct the upbringing and education of their children.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Statutory recognition of the fundamental right
of parents to direct the upbringing and education of their children
would ensure that, when parents and government fight for the right
to make important decisions about child rearing, parents' preeminent
and unambiguous rights will prevail.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>20. What is FRC's opinion of pornography?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC strongly opposes pornography, especially child pornography.
Pornography has a corrupting influence on individuals, turns
natural desires into unnatural cravings, and reduces human beings
to anonymous tools for the stimulation and gratification of those
cravings.

<p>

Contrary to a widespread perception, pornography no longer consists,
if it ever did, primarily of soft air-brushed photos of smiling
young women in various states of undress, or of movies depicting
cheerful, consensual coupling.  Exploiting the phenomenon of customer
desensitization, today's pornographers have turned to themes such
as bondage, mutilation, torture, bestiality, and others.

<p>

Does pornography contribute to rape, battery, and child molestation?
Supporters of pornography say it does not, but the evidence suggests
otherwise:  studies have shown that exposure to pornography
leads to a generalized predisposition toward violent and sexual
acts.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>21. What does FRC think should be done to combat 
pornography?</h2></center>

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> (1) National standards for the determination
of obscenity should be developed.  (2) The law should require
compensation for the victims of pornography.  (3) Obscenity should
be treated as contraband.  (4) Strict liability should be the
legal standard for child-porn possession and distribution.  (5)
Computer networks should be family-friendly.  (6) Cable porn should
not be available on anything other than an opt-in basis.  (7)
All child porn should be made illegal:  pseudo, morphed, sketched,
or written.  (8) Indecency laws should be updated to include cable
and satellite transmission.  (9) Ordinary citizens should have
legal standing to seek injunctions against pornographers.  (10)
Pornography should be banned from U.S. government property, such
as on military bases both in America and abroad.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> The policy steps listed above can
be taken to strengthen the hand of law enforcement against obscenity.
In 1970, the U.S. Postal Service identified 25 mail-order companies
across the country which sent unsolicited, sexually-explicit material
to homes across the country.  By March 1988, the number had grown
to 100 such companies.  Sex movies now make up more than 27 percent
of national video rental revenue.  Rentals and sales of adult
videos soared to $2.5 billion in 1994, and one analyst predicted
a 15 percent increase in that figure when 1995 figures become
available.

<p>

Pornography is also rampant on the worldwide computer system called
the Internet.  In June 1995, a team at Carnegie-Mellon University
released the results of a quantitative analysis of more than 900,000
items on the Internet.  The results:

<p><ul>

<li>83.5 percent of pictorial images available on Usenet newsgroups
devoted to images are pornographic;

<p>

<li>More than 48 percent of all &quot;downloads&quot; from 
&quot;adult&quot; commercial outlets are child porn;

<p>

<li>The two most-frequently-accessed picture categories on the 
&quot;adult&quot; market are child porn and bestiality.

</ul><p>

Dr. Dolf Zillman of Indiana
University, who has conducted research on attitudinal changes
caused by &quot;soft-core&quot; pornography, wrote, &quot;Whatever
the specific contents of standard pornography, there can be no
doubt that effects are created, and consistently so.  There can
be no doubt that pornography, as a form of particularly male entertainment,
promotes the victimization of women in particular.&quot;

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> The enforcement of laws against obscenity and
the development of more legislation to protect our communities
from pornography in all its forms will result in a more family-friendly
world in which to raise children.  When parents and their children
enter the world of television, movies, radio, cyberspace, video
stores, and magazine shelves, the landscape will no longer resemble
fields of land mines.  Women will be protected, as will the institution
of marriage itself.  The deterioration of neighborhoods which
pornography brings will be reversed.  Incidents of date rape and
sexual harassment will be significantly reduced.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>22. What can be done to promote premarital sexual abstinence
and responsible sex education?</h2></center>

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> National and local acknowledgment of parents
as the primary sex educators of their children.  National and
local publicity for and support of grass-roots initiatives which
promote abstinence and secondary virginity, especially those which
are faith-based in their approach.  Local school boards that cooperate
with parents to determine which, if any, sex education curriculum
should be implemented.  Most importantly, parents that give special
attention to personally teaching their own children about sexual
abstinence.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> In recent years, encouraging premarital
abstinence has not been a national priority.  Rather, parents
have often had to single-handedly defend their values to their
children against the onslaught of media, school sex education
programs and school-based clinics, federal family planning initiatives,
and the rhetoric of national leaders which irresponsibly condone
out-of-wedlock sexual activity and attempt to separate premarital
sexual behavior from its inevitable and devastating consequences.

<p>

While there are many federal initiatives which promote &quot;family
planning&quot; and other types of sex education which undermine
the pre-marital sexual abstinence message (i.e., Title X of the
Public Health Service Act, the National Campaign to Prevent Teenage
Pregnancy, etc.), only Title XX of the Public Health Service Act
has devoted any monies and resources to promoting sexual abstinence.
Title XX funding has hovered around $6 million for several years
now, but only about one-third of these monies are dedicated to
abstinence education programs (as opposed to the nearly $200 million
appropriated for Title X alone).  More recently, $75 million was
appropriated for abstinence education in the welfare bill, but
President Clinton vetoed the measure.

<p>

While the Family Research Council supports measures that would
promote pre-marital sexual abstinence, FRC is firmly committed
to the principle that those who are best equipped to guide our
nation's children towards sexual abstinence and other moral and 
character values are their parents first and their community second. 
We believe that the proper role of the government and the media is 
to acknowledge the primary role of parents and to support their 
efforts.

<p>

Promoting premarital sexual abstinence makes good sense in a day
and age when out-of-wedlock pregnancies, illegitimacy, abortion,
and sexually-transmitted diseases are rampant, especially among
the young.  Not only does premarital abstinence help young people
to successfully avoid these physical and societal scourges, it
also increases the likelihood that they will experience an enduring
marriage, sexual satisfaction, and emotional and psychological
health.

<p>

For those young people who do not have the benefit of an intact,
two-parent home,  community programs which promote abstinence
are vitally important.  For example, the Washington, D.C.-based
<I>Best Friends</I> program has successfully helped more than
400 girls aged 10-18 to preserve their virginity and rise above
the teen motherhood and welfare dependency to which so many of
their peers have fallen victim.  In addition to <I>Best Friends</I>,
church-based initiatives such as <I>True Love Waits</I> and school-based
programs such as <I>Teen-Aid</I>, <I>Choosing the Best</I>, and
<I>Teen Choice</I> have all been effective in helping young people
make a commitment towards premarital sexual abstinence.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Enabling parents, churches, and communities to
promote and encourage pre-marital sexual abstinence will strengthen
the American family, especially in the long-term as today's abstinent
young people grow up to form healthy marriages and families. 
Promoting abstinence will also help reduce the incidence and prevalence
of sexually-transmitted diseases, out-of-wedlock pregnancies,
illegitimacy, and welfare-dependency.  Furthermore, the focus
on parents and grass-roots community activism away from government
directives will cost taxpayers less money and will result in better
outcomes for our nation's youth, families, and local communities.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>23. What is FRC's position on spousal benefits?</h2></center>

<p>

In an effort to help alleviate the financial burden on families
in which one spouse stays at home, and to recognize the important
contribution that non-employed spouses make to the income production
of employed spouses (an acknowledgment commonly made in divorce
settlements), FRC fully supports spousal benefits.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b> Legislation allowing expansion of IRA benefits
to non-employed spouses.

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> Complementing the attractive idea
of expanding the uses of IRAs to help free up family finances
(e.g., penalty-free withdrawals to cover major housing, education,
and health expenses) is the proposal to broaden the eligibility
of IRAs to include non-employed spouses.  While broadening the
eligibility of IRAs in general would primarily benefit upper-middle-
and upper-income taxpayers, a more targeted broadening of the
eligibility to non-employed spouses would provide relief primarily
to middle-income families with children -- those most in need
of pro-family tax relief.  Currently, two-earner couples can claim
almost twice the benefits of single-earner couples, penalizing
those families who choose to stay at home with their children
and ignoring the significant contribution the full-time homemaker
makes to the income production of the employed spouse.

<p>

The acknowledgment of the non-employed spouse as a contributor
to the income production of the employed spouse is one already
made in divorce settlements, and is an important principle for
Congress to reinforce.  For families with children, current IRA
benefits financially reinforce families where both parents work
outside the home, while penalizing those families who choose to
have one spouse stay at home to care for the children.

<p>

Legislation broadening IRA eligibility was passed in both the
House and Senate, but vetoed by President Clinton in the proposed
budget for 1996.  Passage of legislation to help level the playing
field for single-earner families is a key step to providing relief
to American families.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> The passage of legislation increasing pro-family
spousal benefits is key to underscoring the importance of the
family and to providing tangible aid to middle-class American
families.  Broadening IRA benefits to non-employed spouses would
give hard-working middle-class families help, by providing savings
and income options for families where one parent stays home to
raise children.

<title>Family Research Council FAQ</title>

<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#000000">

<center><h2>24. Does FRC support Title X of the Public Health Service
Act?</h2></center>

<p>

FRC believes that defunding Title X is the first step in removing
the federal government's imprimatur on out-of-wedlock sex and
to halt its role in distributing contraception to minors without
parental consent.  Defunding Title X is justifiable and necessary
because the program has failed to achieve the goals of reducing
out-of-wedlock pregnancy and abortion.  Indeed, since the inception
of Title X, both the out-of-wedlock pregnancy and abortion rates
have increased dramatically.

<p>

<b>Action Needed:</b>  Zero out funding of Title X of the Public
Health Service Act.  If complete defunding is unsuccessful, support
efforts which cut funding of the program and/or insert &quot;strings&quot;
such as requiring parental notification or consent for any contraception
given to minors, or requiring outcome evaluations of clinics which
receive Title X funds to show their impact on pregnancy, STD,
and abortion rates among clinic &quot;clients.&quot;

<p>

<b>Summary and Rationale:</b> Title X of the Public Health Service
Act was enacted in 1970 as a grant program to fund family planning
projects throughout the country.  It has been funded by Congress
every year through the Labor/HHS Appropriations bills which Congress
considers and passes every summer as part of the federal budget.
The program helped to spawn the proliferation of family planning
clinics within states, granting federal sanction to the distribution
of contraception to unmarried women and to minors without parental
consent.  Title X received more than $193 million last year and should
be defunded altogether.

<p>

The reasons to defund Title X are numerous.  First of all, Title
X is a failed program.  Since the inception of Title X, out-of-wedlock
births, pregnancies, and abortions have all risen dramatically,
particularly in the populations Title X is supposed to have targeted.
Consider the teenage population alone.  Since 1970, the teenage
out-of-wedlock pregnancy and birth rates have doubled, the teenage
abortion rate has more than doubled, and many sexually-transmitted
diseases among teenagers have increased dramatically.  While not
all of this can be directly tied to Title X funding, it is certain
that the federal government's sanction for such programs has led
to an undermining of moral standards by accepting premarital sex
among teenagers as a cultural norm.

<p>

Secondly, Title X should not continue to receive federal funding
because it is an unauthorized program.  Its authorization expired
in 1985.

<p>

Third, Title X is duplicative.  Several other programs such as
Medicaid and the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant provide
family planning to low-income and other targeted populations.
There is no clear basis for the federal government to run a categorical
family planning program when state governments have the capability
to set health care priorities within the parameters of an alternative
block grant.

<p>

Finally, Title X's contraceptive approach leaves many vulnerable
girls open to abuse.  New studies show that most teenage mothers
are not &quot;sexually active&quot; ingenues, but rather victims
of sexual exploitation by much older men.  Title X's contraceptive
approach does not protect these young girls, it only &quot;equips&quot;
them for continued abuse.

<p>

<b>Impact:</b> Defunding Title X will help to uphold the first
principle of the Hippocratic Oath to &quot;do no harm.&quot; 
It will place limits on the wrongheaded attempts of the government
to redefine family life and the social parameters regarding out-of-wedlock
sex.  It will also help to lessen the large monetary advantage
that so-called family planning programs have over abstinence programs,
which have demonstrated superior ability to promote healthy attitudes
and behaviors in the young.
