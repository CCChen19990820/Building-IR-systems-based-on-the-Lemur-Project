Computer Science Students at the University of Utah Reap Benefits of Practical Experience and Enhanced 
Marketability </center>
</b>
<P>
May 1996

<P>
LEGO and Fischertechnik toys aren't just for children at the University of Utah. Students in the Software 
Engineering Lab manipulate these building blocks with hardware devices controlled by programs they've 
written in Visual Basic&reg; and Visual C++&reg;. And while the result of their class projects may 
involve a toy car chasing a toy robot, the knowledge the students gain about programming techniques, 
working in teams, and the entire development cycle transfers into real-world job skills.
<P>

<b>Background</b><BR>

Software Engineering Lab (CS 451, 452, and 453) at the University of Utah is designed to give senior 
undergraduates a chance to spend a year doing software engineering. The course is required for all 
computer science majors. 
<P>
In the past, the course focused on a single, year-long project. Now, it follows a highly structured, software 
engineering curriculum, with the Microsoft&reg; Visual C++ development system and the Visual Basic 
programming system playing important roles. Utilizing software from the Microsoft Instructional Lab 
Grant Program and hardware provided by Hewlett-Packard, the class gives students "very practical 
experience in working with the kinds of computers and systems that are out there and where there are jobs 
available," said Associate Professor Robert Kessler.

<P>
<u>Software Engineering: A Practitioner's Approach</u>, by Pressman, is required reading for the 
course. <u>Visual Basic Superbible</u>, by Potter, Maxwell, and Scott is recommended.
<P>

<b>Fun and competition increase learning</b><BR>

The present course is the brainchild of Professor Kessler and Martin Griss, a technical scientist at HP 
Labs, who was appointed an Adjunct Professor at the University. Their goals are to get students out of 
UNIX&reg; and into the PC world, teach them about team-based software development and fundamental 
software engineering techniques, help them learn disciplined software development, impress on them the 
capabilities of software reuse, and improve their skills in technical communication and writing.
<P>

When designing the course, Kessler and Griss decided to go outside the computer and chose controlling 
children's toys as the primary task of class projects. "This turned out to be a great idea," said Professor 
Kessler. "It is fun and exciting and really gets the students into the competition of building the best 
solutions, which helps them to work harder and learn more."

<P>

<b>Students gain practical experience in developing software with Visual Basic and Visual 
C++</b><BR>


Class lectures and discussion cover more than programming techniques -- they include project 
management, software quality assurance, and software maintenance. Laboratory projects also prepare 
students to deal with real-world development issues. For example, one assignment asks students to update 
applications when system requirements change to include new features. 
<P>

Technical communication is an integral part of the class, so students make extensive use of Microsoft 
Office Professional. They use Microsoft Word to write up their analysis and design results, Internet 
Assistant to aid in the development of Web home pages, and the Microsoft PowerPoint&reg; presentation 
graphics program to present their results. 
<P>
But programming is definitely the key to the course. Students use Microsoft Visual Basic, Professional 
Edition as a glue/development language, Visual C++ to develop reusable software components, and the 
Visual SourceSafeTM version control system to manage development projects. A typical programming 
task involves creating a large, multiple-processor application to control several devices simultaneously. 
"Students have developed OLE controls, data-link libraries, and several different applications," said 
Professor Kessler. 
<P>
Is the class working? "Students have said that they learned the kind of information that helped them to 
land jobs," said Professor Kessler. "So, I think it has enhanced their marketability greatly."
<P>
<blockquote><i>
"The whole environment and technology provided by Visual Basic and Visual C++ is worlds ahead of 
what students are used to coming from the UNIX environment."

<b>
At Wayne State University, a Mathematics Course Teaches Students Probability -- Plus Valuable Visual 
Basic Skills 
</b></center>
<P>
May 1996

<P>
Today, automobile manufacturers and local employers in Detroit are listing computer skills in job 
descriptions that previously required only mathematics and probability. As part of its effort to help 
students succeed in this competitive job market, Wayne State University decided to integrate computing 
tools such as Microsoft&reg; Visual Basic&reg; into its mathematics and statistics courses. 
<P>

<b>Background</b><BR>

Before fall 1995, Introduction to Probability (MAT 570) was a standard, intermediate-level probability 
course for math majors and students in applied sciences at Wayne State University. However, as part of an 
initiative carried out throughout the Mathematics department, Professor Robert Berman redesigned the 
course to include computer programming. The tool of choice? The Microsoft Visual Basic programming 
system.
<P>
The course is an elementary introduction to the mathematical theory of probability. It is designed for 
mathematics majors as well as for students who seek degrees in other sciences. MAT 570 is an elective for 
mathematics majors and a requirement for a master's degree in statistics.
<P>
The math course teaches students how to use Visual Basic and the Microsoft QuickBasic&reg; 
development system to do combinatorial calculations and to simulate probability experiments. Required 
reading includes <u>Probability</u> by Jim Pitman. In addition, Professor Berman recommends that 
students read two additional texts: <u>Microsoft QBasic, 3rd Edition</u> and <u>An Introduction to 
Programming Using Visual Basic</u>, both by David Schneider. 
<P>

<b>Students enjoy working with Visual Basic</b><BR>

Topics covered during the semester include probability spaces, conditional probability, independence, the 
law of large numbers, and central limit theorems. In the class, students study a variety of probability 
models and learn how to do computer simulations of them. Examples include poker, the lottery, and 
Monte Carlo methods for computing integrals.
<P>

"I thought it would be interesting and enjoyable for students to work in the Windows&reg; environment 
and use Visual Basic," Berman said. According to the class, he made the right choice. "It turned out that 
this is one of the most enjoyable aspects of the course for the students," he said. 

<P>

<b>Knowledge of Microsoft software valued by local employers</b><BR>

The students in this course usually plan careers in applied mathematics, science, and computer-related 
areas. According to Berman, the automobile industry -- which hires many Wayne State University 
graduates -- frequently asks for knowledge of computers, as well as of probability and statistics, in their 
job descriptions. When they mention specific software product knowledge, says Berman, "along with 
certain statistical packages, Microsoft software is the most commonly mentioned."
Besides Visual Basic, the Microsoft Instructional Lab Grant Program enables students to use Microsoft 
Excel, the Microsoft Windows 95 operating system, and Microsoft Word. 
Professor Berman chose Microsoft products because they are widely used and easy to learn. "Visual Basic 
has a special appeal since it makes programming in the Windows environment possible for non-experts," 
he said. "This allows students to learn to create Windows-based applications at the same time as they 
learn the nuts and bolts of probability."

<P>
<blockquote><i>
"The use of Visual Basic instead of traditional programming languages allows students to take full 
advantage of the graphical user interface and to link their programs with other computing tools. The 
result is that they can create more powerful, user-friendly programs."
</i><p>

<B>At the University of Massachusetts Lowell, Students Use Visual
Basic and Visual C++-and Get an In-Depth Understanding of Microsoft
Windows</B>
<P>
June 1996
</CENTER>

<P>
<I>When CS professors at the University of Massachusetts Lowell
realized they needed solid programming tools for students, they
decided to add Microsoft  Visual Basic  and Microsoft Visual C++
to their Microsoft Windows programming courses. Students in CS
91.353, the first course in a series, use these development tools
to learn how to program. As an added benefit, students also gain
a working knowledge of the Microsoft Windows operating system.</I>
<P>
<B>Background</B>
<P>
University of Massachusetts Lowell Computer Science course 91.353-GUI
Programming for Windowing Environments I-is an introduction to
the design and implementation of interactive programs for Microsoft
Windows. The class covers Windows techniques and style as well
as the basics of program implementation. Taught by Associate Professor
Jesse Heines, the class is an intermediate-level course that is
an elective for computer science majors.
<P>
Required reading for the course includes<I> Guide to Visual Basic
4 for Windows 95 </I>by Peter Norton, Harold Davis, and Phyllis
Davis. <I>Inside Visual C++ Version 4</I>, by David Kruglinski,
is also required. Professor Heines uses selected articles from
the &quot;Visual Basic Programmer's Journal&quot; and the &quot;Microsoft
Systems Journal&quot; to supplement the textbooks. 
<P>
<B>VB helps students see the forest <I>and </I>the trees</B>
<P>
The class begins by looking at Windows through the medium of the
Microsoft Visual Basic programming system. Professor Heines starts
with Visual Basic rather than the Microsoft C++ development system
because, he says, &quot;diving right into C++ programming causes
one to miss the forest for the trees.&quot; He adds, &quot;Even
though we all think we know what the Windows graphical user interface
is and how it works from a user point of view, one needs to understand
it more thoroughly before one can begin writing programs for this
environment.&quot;
<P>
To help students gain that understanding, Professor Heines devotes
the first third of the class to Visual Basic. &quot;Visual Basic
[is] a very valuable Windows programming tool in its own right,&quot;
says the professor. Studying it first also allows students to
learn Windows capabilities and message passing thoroughly before
they &quot;get into Visual C++ programming to understand the innards.&quot;
<P>
<B>Programming assignments give students skills to land jobs</B>
<P>
During the course, students write at least two programs in Visual
Basic and three in Visual C++. Most assignments are enhancements
to the programs in David Kruglinski's book.
<P>
Students also submit a final project and present it to the class.
During that presentation, students describe the problems they
ran into during program development and the techniques they used
to deal with those problems. 
<P>
By the end of the course, students are expected to be able to
trace Windows message-passing routes, write highly interactive
programs in Visual Basic, call functions in the Windows API and
other data link libraries (DLLs) from Visual Basic, develop simple
programs in Visual C++, and use Visual C++ to create DLLs that
can be called from Visual Basic. In addition, students learn the
functionality of all basic graphical user interface (GUI) components,
plus the major user interface and architectural differences between
Windows 3.x and Windows 95.
<P>
Why did the computer science department choose Microsoft products
to support its Windows programming courses? The overriding concern
was to teach classes using tools that are standard in the industry.
&quot;We had previously used a different programming product,&quot;
explains Professor Heines, &quot;but the Microsoft Foundation
Class Library is more widely used than [others].&quot;
<P>
The main benefit for students who know how to program with Microsoft
tools is increased job opportunities. &quot;We are in the Massachusetts
high-tech corridor,&quot; says Professor Heines, &quot;where there
are many jobs for students with Windows programming skills.&quot;
<HR>

<P>
<blockquote><I>&quot;We tackled OLE  this spring, and that was really an amazing
growth experience for the instructor as well as the students!&quot;</I>

d technologies.  Although many teachers see the value of
students learning about computers and other technologies,
some are not aware of the resources technology can offer
them as professionals in carrying out the many aspects of
their jobs.

o  Although some schools have made progress in helping
teachers to use basic technological tools such as word
processing, they still struggle with curriculum integration,
which is central if technology is to become a truly
effective educational resource. Yet integration is a
difficult, time-consuming, and resource-intensive endeavor.

o  Technology can be a valuable resource for improving
teacher education.  It can bring models of the best teaching
live from the classroom into the colleges of education, or
provide video case studies of teaching styles and
approaches.  It can forge stronger connections among student
teachers, mentor teachers in the field, and university
faculty.

o  Despite the importance of technology in teacher
education, it is not central to the teacher preparation
experience in most U.S. colleges of education today.  Most
new teachers graduate from teacher preparation institutions
with limited knowledge of the ways technology can be used in
their professional practice.

o  The federal government has played a limited role in
technology-related teacher development compared with states,
universities, and school districts.  Even so, past federal
programs have piloted innovative educational applications of
technology for teachers by providing significant support for
professional development (especially among mathematics,
science, and special education teachers) and by providing
funding for technology-related professional development in
school districts that could not have supported it on their
own.

o  The federal government and the private sector have tended
to focus more on technology assistance and funding to K-12
schools than to colleges of education.  This approach may
address current needs but does not greatly influence teacher
preparation or quality over the long term.

POLICY OPTIONS

The array of technology for education is diverse, changing,

strategy for the federal role in educational technology
across the government, and a framework for an environment of
experimentation, evaluation, and sharing of results.

Federal regulatory actions could include establishing
priorities or bonus points related to technology in
competitive grant programs, issuing policy statements
highlighting expenditures for technology and professional
development where the law permits, and eliminating
unnecessary nonstatutory restrictions on the use of funds
for technology or training purposes.  This could be a
particularly strong policy tool for leadership in areas
likely to continue to receive substantial funding, such as
the Title I program for disadvantaged students.

Research, development, and dissemination

Funders might be willing to make greater investments in
educational technology and related professional development
if there were better research suggesting the conditions
under which such investments would be most effective, and if
the results of available research were more widely
distributed.  Educational research and dissemination has
traditionally been a federal role.

Congress could direct the Department of Education or some
other entity to undertake research that examines the
effectiveness of various technology tools and applications,
including whether and how technologies work for teachers.
Fertile areas of federal research could include
investigations on whether using technology changes teaching
and, if so, for which teachers and under what conditions;
research on teachers as members of work groups and how the
teacher's work life is changed by technologies; and
alternate models of assigning teachers their time and duties
when technology takes over some roles.

It is widely believed that educational applications of new
technological developments often lag behind other
applications. Congress could direct federal executive branch
agencies to increase their support for continuing research
and development necessary for the production of powerful,
flexible learning tools and applications. The development of
the next generation of integrated curriculum products can
work hand-in-hand with proposed educational standards in all
curricular areas and could be undertaken as a national
research priority.  The federal government's seed money for
product development can be said to have resulted in a
sequential form of public-private partnership as technology
products or projects have been developed, tested, and
evaluated with federal support and later made commercially
available.

Alternatively, the federal government could opt not to
increase its role in education research and development, and
encourage development of new education technologies by the
private sector.  If Congress or the executive branch took
this approach, it would be worthwhile to study  whether K-12
schools and colleges of education,  with their persistent
constraints on resources, represent enough of a market for
educational technology product developers and how this
market might be aggregated.

In education there is a large gap between research findings
and their applications in day-to-day practice.  If it wants
teachers to use technologies wisely, Congress could continue
to encourage the use of technology--especially
telecommunications networks--as a dissemination tool to
share research results and get the results into the
classroom where teachers can use them.

Educating new teachers, professional development, and
teacher support

The executive branch could encourage states, universities,
and school districts to consider integrating technology into
various professional development activities--inservice and
preservice--supported under existing education legislation.
Particular attention should be focused on the recently
revised Eisenhower professional development program
(emphasized in P.L. 103-382), which calls for a larger
federal teacher professional development effort in several
subjects.  The use of technology as a tool to provide more
effective professional development  could be given greater
focus in all such programs.

Congress or the executive branch could require that all
applications for federal grants that include technology show
adequate budgets for preparation of staff and continuing
support. This could help to assure that teachers will be
given support over the long term, not just when the
technology is brought in the door.  Similarly, schools and
districts could seek such support from private sector
businesses.

The executive branch could on its own (or under Congress's
direction) encourage and support technology applications
when considering funding requests from schools and colleges
of education. Schools and colleges of education should be
encouraged to adopt teaching with technology so that new
teachers learn by example.

School access to the emerging telecommunications
infrastructure

The 104th Congress is once again considering revisions to
the Communications Act of 1934.  If Congress wants schools
and teachers to have access to the emerging national and
global telecommunications infrastructures, it may need to
consider carefully how different  approaches will affect
access by those in education.

It is becoming clear that access goes well beyond sheer
numbers of machines and includes access to information
available on those machines. Over the next decade, many
individual, local, state, federal, and business decisions
will determine whether this resource is broadly available or
greatly restricted.  Given the large federal role in
interstate telecommunications issues, if schools are not to
be left behind, Congress will need to pay close attention to
this issue as it debates regulatory and subsidy measures.

It is important to note that none of the options for federal
action discussed in this report necessarily requires a major
new investment of federal funds or a major direct federal
role. For example, none of them suggests that the federal
government step in and install new technologies in all K-12
schools or colleges of education, or create a new
bureaucracy for training teachers, or directly transfer
resources from the telecommunications sector to educational
institutions.  The options presented here--federal, private,
and local--are designed to support collaboration and
voluntary efforts by those schools and districts that desire
or require additional resources--and national
encouragement--to take advantage of and experiment with, new
educational technologies that show promise for teachers and
teaching.

TEACHING AND TECHNOLOGY: THE BARRIERS

Lack of teacher time to

o  Experiment with new technologies

o  Share experiences with other teachers

o  Plan lessons using technology

o  Attend technology courses or meetings

Access

o  Hardware and software are limited

o  Upgrades, support, and training are continuing costs

o  Technologies may not be located in or near the classroom

o  Much of the hardware in schools is old and cannot handle
newer applications

o  Telecommunications requires new or updated wiring or
phone lines

Vision or rationale for technology use

o  Schools and districts need technology planning and
leadership

o  Teachers need an understanding of curricular uses of
technology

o  Teachers lack models of technology for their professional
use

o  Messages on best uses change as technologies change

Training and support

o  Districts spend far less on teacher training than on
hardware and software

o  Training focuses on the mechanics, not on integrating
technology into the curriculum

o  Few schools have a full-time, school-level computer
coordinator

Current assessment practices

o  Standardized tests may not reflect what students learn
with technology

o  Teachers are held immediately accountable for changes
that take time to show results

ALTERNATIVE COCA REDUCTION STRATEGIES IN THE ANDEAN REGION--
REPORT BRIEF

Recommended Citation: U.S. Congress, Office of Technology
Assessment, Alternative Coca Reduction Strategies in the
Andean Region, F-556 (Washington, DC: U.S. Government
Printing Office, July 1993).

GPO stock #052-003-01329-1; 220 p.; $12.00.
NTIS order #PB93-218899.
***********************************************************
Cocaine trafficking and abuse are formidable problems that
disrupt social, economic, and political systems.  In
Alternative Coca Reduction Strategies in the Andean Region,
OTA identifies opportunities and constraints to coca
reduction and explores potential policy directions to
improve the effectiveness of ongoing activities.

Despite national commitments and international treaties,
stopping the flow of cocaine through international black
markets to date has proven impossible.  Strong demand
continues to promote coca production and cocaine processing
in supplying nations.  For nearly 20 years, the United
States has invested in a broad array of supply reduction
activities in the Andean region.  There has been little
local popular Andean support for some of these efforts,
which often have been viewed as heavy-handed and intrusive.

Coca has been important in South America for nearly 4,000
years and remains a critical element in traditional Andean
and Amazonian cultures.  Most coca currently is produced in
Peru and Bolivia (87 percent) and Colombia (13 percent),
where the cocaine industry fuels and is fueled by social
inequities and political and economic unrest.  In some
instances, coca also has played a large role in national
economies (e.g., the coca economy has generated as much as
98 percent of Bolivia's foreign exchange from exported goods
and services).  Although earnings at the producer level are
no more than 2 percent of the wholesale value of cocaine,
they are nearly twice that of identified high-value crops
and at least four times that of other traditional crops.

***********************
*  CROP SUBSTITUTION  *
***********************

Development-oriented strategies for coca reduction, such as
crop substitution, have focused on providing high-value crop
production options for those involved in the coca trade.
Diversifying and intensifying agricultural production
systems through incor- porating high-value crops (e.g.,
tropical fruits and nuts, coffee, and spices) and expanding
production area are the driving forces behind current crop
substitution efforts.  A blend of these approaches
integrated systems of high-value and staple crops could
provide a basis for reducing food imports, entering
international markets, and thereby increasing agricultural
profitability.  Inherent in this strategy is the use of
transitional systems that provide for the farmer's basic
needs as the new production system is developed.

The Andean countries have a wide range of renewable
resources that could be developed to increase economic
options.  While much attention has been placed on narrowly
defined agricultural opportunities, less emphasis has been
directed toward the potential for expanding sustainable
exploitation of other resources such as forests, wildlife,
wildlands, or fisheries.  Indeed, many coca-growing areas
are more suitable for some of these options than
agriculture.

***********************************************
*  SUPPORTING ALTERNATIVE PRODUCTION OPTIONS  *
***********************************************

Whatever the product, supporting technologies are needed to
enable producers to compete in national and global markets.
Key needs in the Andean region include:

	o  Research, extension, and access to improved
technologies;

	o  Processing, transport, handling, storage, and
communication infrastructure; and

	o  Increased product quantity and quality and trade
programs to increase competitiveness of Andean products.

Meeting these needs is the ultimate challenge facing
national and international development organizations.

Research and extension play an enormous role in developing
suitable technology packages for coca farmers.  Existing
research and extension systems are not well-equipped to
fulfill this role, and economic disparities and political
conditions restrict the level of national funding for these
efforts.  Technology transfer can provide assistance in this
arena, but improvements are needed.

Adequate infrastructure is critical to support production
and marketing of alternative crops.  The ability to move
necessary inputs into producing regions and raw or processed
materials out to wider markets depends on reliable
transportation.  The lack of affordable credit hinders
private sector investment in infrastructure, and servicing
of international loans constrains government investment in
comprehensive infrastructure projects.

Production of alternative crops is not yet at a level where
Andean producers can enter international markets
effectively, largely because of the small production units.
Marketing agricultural products also can be complicated by
the strict product quality and safety requirements of
importing nations.  Such restrictions can be difficult to
meet without proper training and assistance programs.  A
market-driven approach is evident in the U.S.-Bolivia
Cochabamba Regional Development Project (CORDEP), but the
support structure necessary to sustain alternative
livelihoods is lacking or inadequate.

*****************
* COCA CONTROL  *
*****************

Coca eradication has been an intermittent companion to
development and primarily has been accomplished by manual or
chemical means.  Currently, there is renewed interest in
applying biological control (biocontrol) technology the use
of living organisms to reduce a target pest population to
narcotic crops.  At least 44 arthropods, 24 fungi, 1
nematode, and 1 virus are known to attack the major cocaine-
producing species (i.e., Erythroxylum coca var. coca).  In
fact, two of these pests, Eloria noyesi and Fusarium
oxysporum, have been linked to losses of nearly 30,000 coca
hectares in Peru.

Biocontrol is based on a density-dependent balance as the
target numbers decrease so does the control agent
population.  Further, only about 48 percent of biocontrol
projects have achieved a measurable degree of success and
only under conditions without security risks or likelihood
of countermeasures.  The potential for achieving similar
success within the framework of a narcotics control program
may be less likely.  Thus, while application of biocontrol
methodology could reduce coca in target areas, it is not
likely to result in coca eradication.

Crop substitution and control efforts are inherently slow.
The extent and importance of the coca economy in the Andean
nations strongly influence the ability of narrowly focused,
short-term efforts to achieve promising results in coca
substitution.

BENEFIT DESIGN IN HEALTH CARE REFORM:
PATIENT COST-SHARING BACKGROUND PAPER--REPORT BRIEF

Recommended Citation: U.S. Congress, Office of Technology
Assessment, Benefit Design in Health Care Reform: Patient
Cost-Sharing, BP-H-112 (Washington, DC: U.S. Government
Printing Office, September 1993).

GPO stock #052-003-01339-8.
NTIS order #PB93-231348.
***********************************************************
Patient Cost-Sharing examines the health services and
economics research literature to learn what is known about
how patient cost-sharing affects the use of health care
services, expenditures, and, ultimately, health outcomes.
The background paper focuses on cost-sharing in the form of
deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments for basic physician
and hospital care (Box A).

OTA found that the available research on patient cost-
sharing has significant limitations (see Box B). However,
the patient cost-sharing literature does offer some
fundamental lessons about the impact of patient cost-
sharing, primarily on the use of health care services in a
generally healthy, nonelderly population operating within an
unmanaged fee-for-service payment and delivery system. A
close examination of the patient-cost-sharing research can
also be used to challenge some commonly held notions about
cost-sharing (see Table 1).

The cost-sharing literature makes very clear a basic lesson
of human nature: people will use services, even health
services, less often when they have to pay for them. By
keeping people out of the health care system altogether,
coinsurance requirements have been found to substantially
reduce health care spending that is, expenses reimbursed by
health insurers as well as out-of-pocket costs for covered
services borne by the participants. However, conventional
wisdom to the contrary, there is no evidence that people
make better choices and decisions about their health care
when they bear some of the cost.

The conventional wisdom is that there are no health effects
from patient cost-sharing, but a close examination of
available research reveals reasons to be cautious about the
extent to which cost-sharing is relied on to control costs,
especially for sick, low-income individuals. These
individuals are the most likely to benefit from receiving
health care services at no out-of-pocket cost and the most
likely to be harmed by patient cost-sharing requirements. In
addition, the lack of information on how patient cost-
sharing affects children and adults in poor health,
regardless of their income, is worrisome.

Finally, available research on patient cost-sharing sheds
little light on a number of important policy issues,
including: the effects of deductibles and flat copayments;
patient cost-sharing in managed care; whether there are
specific services or patient populations that should be
considered for exemption; the health impacts on people with,
or at high risk for, chronic illnesses; balance billing; and
whether it is administratively feasible to base patient
cost-sharing on income.

This background paper is one of a series of publications on
benefit design in health care reform being issued as part of
the Office of Technology Assessment's evaluation of
Technology, Insurance, and the Health Care System.

The overall assessment is being conducted in response to a
request from the Senate Committee on Labor and Human
Resources (Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Chairman), which was
endorsed by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce
(Congressman John D. Dingell, Chairman), the House Committee
on Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health (then-Ranking
Minority Member Willis D. Gradison), and Senator Charles
Grassley, a member of OTA's Technology Assessment Board.
Congressman Dingell asked OTA to assess the extent to which
a minimum benefit package could be designed based on
information about health effects and cost-effectiveness.
************************************************************
BOX A--WHAT IS PATIENT COST-SHARING?

Cost-sharing for patients insured by traditional indemnity
or fee-for-service (FFS) health insurance plans typically
consists of:

	o  an initial deductible, that is, the amount of
covered health care expenses that must be incurred by a
health insurance plan enrollee and his or her dependents
before any health benefits become payable by the health
insurer,

	o  plus a percentage of covered expenses each time a
service is rendered (e.g., 20 percent), referred to as
coinsurance,

	o  up to a maximum annual dollar limit on covered out-
of-pocket expenses (deductible and coinsurance requirements)
incurred by the health plan enrollee.

	Members of staff and group-model health maintenance
organizations (HMOs) are rarely subject to deductibles or
coinsurance but increasingly pay a flat copayment for visits
to health care providers (e.g., $10) and sometimes for
hospitalization (e.g., $100).

	Deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments are all
designed, in part, to make people "think twice" before
seeking care and to forgo the use of services that are
expected to bring little benefit.

	Aside from requirements for cost-sharing for covered
services, insured individuals can have other, sometimes
substantial, out-of-pocket health care costs (e.g., for
uncovered services, in balance billing).
************************************************************
BOX B--IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS OF THE BEST OF THE PATIENT
COST-SHARING RESEARCH LITERATURE

Of the limited amount of research literature on the health
care utilization, cost, and health effects of patient cost-
sharing, the Rand Health Insurance Experiment (HIE) provides
policymakers the richest information. The Rand HIE is, for
example, the only available study of the health effects of
patient cost-sharing. Nonetheless, there are significant
limitations to the experiment's relevance to today's health
reform deliberations. These limitations result largely from
three factors: the dramatic changes in American health care
delivery and financing since the time of the experiment
(1974 through 1982), the relatively small size of the HIE
study population, and the unique nature of the health
coverage provided to HIE participants. It is important to
know that the HIE was essentially a study of the effects of
coinsurance on the average use of traditional, fee-for-
service medical care by generally healthy, nonelderly
individuals who were either well- or very well-insured. The
most critical limitations are outlined below:

	o  The HIE health plans were atypically comprehensive;
for example, prescription drugs and preventive care were
fully covered.

	o  HIE participants had complete freedom of choice of
providers and there were no limits on providers' discretion
to order services for patients hardly typical of today's
increasingly restrictive managed-care environment.

	o  The sample size was too small to adequately measure
how the experiment affected the health of low-income
children and adults, adults with chronic conditions such as
cancer and rheumatoid arthritis, and children with chronic
diseases such as asthma, with congenital anomalies, or with
life-threatening conditions.

	o  "Low income" was defined differently in the various
Rand HIE analyses, sometimes including individuals with
family incomes as great as two times the Federal poverty
level (FPL).

	o  All the participants in the experiment were
protected to some extent by income-based limits on their
out-of-pocket costs. This feature of the experiment probably
moderated the effect of cost-sharing on low-income
participants.

	o  Any possible long-term health effects of cost-
sharing could not be identified with confidence because
participants were followed for a maximum of five years.

	o  The HIE could not examine how providers might
respond to large-scale changes in patient cost-sharing.

	o  Finally, the HIE and the cost-sharing literature in
general offer almost no insight into how cost-sharing
influences use of care and health outcomes in a managed-care
environment.

BENEFIT DESIGN IN HEALTH CARE REFORM: REPORT--CLINICAL
PREVENTIVE SERVICE--REPORT BRIEF

Recommended Citation: U.S. Congress, Office of Technology
Assessment, Benefit Design in Health Care Reform: Report--
Clinical Preventive Service, H-580 (Washington, DC: U.S.
Government Printing Office, September 1993.)

GPO stock #052-003-01340-1.
NTIS order #PB93-231330.
***********************************************************
Preventive health care services are often portrayed as "good
investments" and thus are often considered potentially good
candidates for health insurance coverage. The Office of
Technology Assessment's Report, Benefit Design in Health
Care Reform: Report #1--Clinical Preventive Services,
examines this perception and considers the role that
information regarding the efficacy of such services and
their cost-effectiveness can, and cannot, play in choosing
specific clinical preventive services to cover.

The Report focuses primarily on screening services for
apparently healthy people. Screening services are designed
to detect disease at an early stage. Some other preventive
services such as immunization and contraceptive programs are
also reviewed. The purpose of the Report is to place the
issue of using scientific evidence regarding clinical
preventive services at the forefront of the health care
reform and insurance coverage debates.

***********************
*  MAJOR CONCLUSIONS  *
***********************

	o  Many clinical preventive services have not been
evaluated in terms of their efficacy or cost-effectiveness.
Therefore, their value is unknown.

	o  Some screening services are apparently effective in
that they reduce or delay the incidence and burden of
disease for some patients. However, very few provide a net
savings in medical costs to society when the screening
services are provided to persons who face only an average
risk for developing the condition.

	o  Even when preventive services are found to be "cost-
effective," that does not mean there will be a net savings
in health care expenditures. Cost-effectiveness is always a
statement about the costs of an intervention relative to its
success in reducing the incidence of an illness or condition
and its consequences.

	o  If policymakers wish to save money or improve the
health of the population, or both, they will need to
carefully consider the criteria for supporting preventive
services, taking into consideration the characteristics of
the patient population, the frequency of screening, and
attendant costs. The costs and cost-effectiveness of
clinical preventive services can vary greatly, depending on
the targeted population's underlying risk for the condition
and the circumstances under which the intervention is
applied.

	o  Examples of clinical preventive services that
evidence shows are effective include: screening for breast
cancer (mammography and clinical breast examination) in
women 50 years of age and older; screening for cervical
cancer (Pap smears) for women who are or have been sexually
active; cholesterol screening for certain individuals;
selected smoking cessation interventions; hypertension
screening for certain individuals; adult immunizations for
certain individuals; and screening for sexually transmitted
diseases for certain individuals. Although these services
are effective--in the sense that they are likely to result
in net benefits to health--all have been found likely to
increase financial costs to society when applied to
populations that are only at average risk for the specific
condition (with the exception of screening for sexually
transmitted diseases which has not been extensively
evaluated using cost-effectiveness analysis).

	o  Examples of clinical preventive services that are
effective and also can reduce (societal) medical care costs
include: most childhood immunizations; newborn screening for
some congenital disorders (hypothyroidism and
phenylketonuria); and prenatal care for poor women.

	o  Insurance for preventive care is provided primarily
to encourage the use of preventive interventions, rather
than to protect against the risk of catastrophic medical
costs. Available evidence suggests that insurance coverage
will increase the use of such services, but not to optimal
levels. Whether insurance coverage--or some additional or
other means--should be used to help encourage the use of
clinical preventive services is in part a scientific
question. It is also a philosophical question and depends on
what one considers the purpose of health insurance to be--to
spread financial risk or to encourage utilization.

************************
*  ISSUES AND OPTIONS  *
************************

Analysis of alternative approaches to insurance coverage for
preventive services suggests that the question is more
complicated than "to cover or not to cover."  The
accompanying figure outlines key prevention-related policy
issues facing Congress as it considers health care reform.
Each of these issues and related options are discussed in
OTA's Report.

This Report is one of a series of publications on benefit
design in health care reform being issued as part of the
Office of Technology Assessment's evaluation of Technology,
Insurance, and the Health Care System. The other
publications in the benefit design series deal with patient
cost-sharing (September 1993), mental health and substance
abuse treatment services (in preparation), and general
policy issues (in preparation).

The overall assessment is being conducted in response to a
request from the Senate Committee on Labor and Human
Resources (Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Chairman), that was
endorsed by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce
(Congressman John D. Dingell, Chairman), the House Committee
on Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health (then-Ranking
Minority Member Willis D. Gradison), and Senator Charles
Grassley, a member of OTA's Technology Assessment Board.
Congressman Dingell asked OTA to assess the extent to which
a minimum benefit package could be designed based on
information about health effects and cost-effectiveness.

BIOPOLYMERS: MAKING MATERIALS NATURE'S WAY--REPORT BRIEF

***********************************************************
As policymakers search for new approaches that address solid
waste problems and other ecological concerns, the natural
world may offer some important solutions.  An emerging class
of biologically derived materials with potential
applications in virtually every industrial sector may soon
play a role in transforming patterns of resource use and
waste generation.  In coming years, the possibility of using
proteins, carbohydrates, and other natural substances to
meet the materials requirements of an expanding economy is
likely to receive increasing attention. The OTA Background
Paper Biopolymers: Making Materials Nature's Way provides an
overview of these new materials and describes the principal
technical and economic challenges affecting biopolymer
commercialization efforts.

Throughout history, humans have relied extensively on
biological materials like wool, leather, silk, and
cellulose. (These four materials are natural polymers.
Polymers are substances composed of repeating structural
units linked together to form long chains.)  Today, such
natural polymers can be tailored to meet specific needs.
The advent of modern biotechnology has fundamentally changed
the way scientists view organisms and the materials they
produce.  For example, the genetic manipulation of some
plant species could give rise to a new source of structural
polymers that supplant traditional commodity plastics.  By
harnessing the enzymes found in nature, or modifying
agricultural or marine feedstocks, a new class of
biodegradable, biocompatible, and renewable materials is
being introduced.

Polymers play a central role in modern industrial economies.
Synthetic polymers such as nylon, polyethylene, and
polyurethane have transformed daily life. From automobile
bodies to packaging, compact discs to clothing, and food
additives to medicine, humanmade polymers pervade virtually
every aspect of modern society. However, the growing
reliance on synthetic polymers has raised a number of
environmental and human health concerns. Most plastic
materials, for instance, are not biodegradable and are
derived from nonrenewable resources. The very properties of
durability and strength that make these materials so useful
also ensure their persistence in the environment and
complicate their disposal.  In addition, the synthesis of
some polymeric materials involves the use of toxic compounds
or the generation of toxic byproducts.

These problems have focused increased attention on polymers
that are derived from biological precursors or are produced
using the methods of modern biotechnology.  Such biopolymers
may prove to have a variety of environmental benefits.
Possible applications range from agriculturally or
bacterially derived thermoplastics that are truly
biodegradable, to novel medical materials that are
biocompatible, to water treatment compounds that prevent
mineral buildup and corrosion. However, because materials
typically have many different properties, in certain
applications biopolymers may not necessarily provide
environmental advantages over conventional polymers. In
practice, it is extremely difficult to develop testing
methods that assess the environmental characteristics of
materials.

In recent years, a number of significant technical
developments, particularly in the area of genetic
engineering, have enhanced the commercial prospects of
biologically derived polymers. The advent of recombinant DNA
technology has allowed researchers to exercise unprecedented
control over the purity and specific properties of polymers.
Recombinant DNA technology allows direct manipulation of the
genetic code of individual cells. The ability to direct
which genes are used by cells permits the creation of
biological materials with customized physical and chemical
properties. For example, researchers have created new
protein polymers that have extraordinary tensile strength
and elasticity.

Advances in genetic engineering have also enabled scientists
to study how biological systems produce complex polymers.
It is remarkable that living organisms are able to create
sophisticated materials (e.g., spider silk) at normal
temperature and pressure in water-based environments,
without causing ecological disruption. In contrast, many
humanmade materials are synthesized at high temperature and
pressure, consuming a great deal of energy, and require
toxic substances at various stages of processing. Thus,
biopolymer research could also lead to the development of
new environmentally sensitive manufacturing methods.

Biopolymers are a diverse and extremely versatile group of
materials. For example, they can be used as adhesives,
absorbents, lubricants, soil conditioners, cosmetics, drug
delivery vehicles, orthopedic implants, food additives,
textiles, high-strength structural materials, water
treatment chemicals, biosensors, and even computational
switching devices. Currently, many biopolymers are still in
the developmental stage, but important applications are
beginning to emerge in the areas of packaging, food
production, and biomedicine.  Some biopolymers can directly
replace synthetically derived materials in traditional
applications, whereas others possess unique properties that
could open up a range of new commercial opportunities. Novel
biopolymer compounds are being investigated by established
agricultural and chemical firms, as well as small
biotechnology enterprises.

********************************
*  Commercialization Barriers  *
********************************

Yet, despite the promise of these new materials, a series of
economic and engineering hurdles may impede their market
introduction in the near term. Even if some biopolymers are
shown to have environmental characteristics that are
preferable to conventional polymers, much work needs to be
done to bring down the costs of biologically derived
materials. Commercially available biopolymers are typically
2 to 5 times more expensive than synthetic resins. In only a
few specialized applications, such as biomedicine, are the
relatively high costs of biopolymer materials not likely to
impede market growth. Since many biopolymers are in early
phases of development, it is difficult to determine whether
economy-of-scale manufacturing will be able to bring down
the current high production costs for these materials. The
commercialization difficulties facing biopolymers in many
ways resemble the problems confronting other emerging
technologies, such as photovoltaic cells and fuel cells.
Production costs for new technologies can be lowered by
ramping up manufacturing capacity, but without market
demand, it is not possible to make the necessary
investments to achieve those low costs.

**********************
*  The Federal Role  *
**********************

Because biopolymers have applications in many different
sectors of the economy, their widespread use could have
important competitive implications. Japan and the European
Community are currently sponsoring major programs in
biopolymer science and manufacturing. In contrast, U.S.
Government-sponsored research and development (R&D) efforts
in the biopolymer area are relatively limited in scope.
However, for the moment, the United States is well
positioned in some areas of biopolymer development because
of its strong agricultural base, expertise in polymer
engineering, and active biotechnology sector. The relative
competitive position of the United States could be enhanced
by fostering greater collaboration among researchers in
government, industry, and academia. For example, the efforts
of the private sector to overcome technical barriers might
be aided by such Federal programs as the Advanced Technology
Program of the Department of Commerce, or the cooperative
research and development programs (CRADAs) of the Department
of Agriculture and the various Department of Energy national
laboratories. Fundamental research barriers in the
biopolymer field could also be better addressed by bringing
greater coherence to the R&D efforts of the different
Federal agencies.

***********************
*  Regulatory Issues  *
***********************

There are a number of existing or potential regulatory
factors that could affect biopolymer development and
commercialization efforts.  These include the Food and Drug
Administration approval process for medical products that
use biopolymers, the development of legal definitions for
biodegradable materials, regulations affecting the use of
genetically engineered systems for producing biopolymers,
and requirements regarding the introduction of new
industrial chemicals.

Regulatory uncertainties, along with the economic and
technical obstacles facing biopolymers, pose difficult
challenges for industry managers and policymakers alike.

REPORT BRIEF
September 1994
*

*
CIVILIAN SATELLITE REMOTE SENSING: A STRATEGIC APPROACH
*

Over the past two decades, data from Earth sensing
satellites have become important in helping to predict the
weather, improve public safety, map Earth's features and
infrastructure, manage natural resources, and study
environmental change. In the future, the United States and
other countries are likely to increase their reliance on
these systems to gather useful data about Earth.

U.S. and foreign satellite remote sensing systems often have
overlapping requirements and redundant capabilities. To
improve the nation's return on its investment in remote
sensing technologies, to meet the needs of data users more
effectively, and to take full advantage of other nations'
capabilities, Congress may wish to initiate a long-term,
comprehensive plan for Earth observations. A national
strategy for the development and operation of future remote
sensing systems could help guide near-term decisions to
ensure that future data needs will be satisfied. By
harmonizing individual agency priorities in a framework of
overall national priorities, a strategic plan would help
ensure that agencies meet broad-based national data needs
with improved efficiency and reduced cost.

*
ELEMENTS OF A STRATEGIC PLAN
*

A comprehensive strategic plan would endeavor to:

o  incorporate the data needs of both government and
nongovernment data users,

o  improve the efficiency and reduce the costs of space and
data-handling systems,

o  involve private operators of remote sensing systems,

o  incorporate international civilian operational and
experimental remote sensing programs, and

o  guide the development of new sensor and spacecraft
technologies.

*
MEETING DATA REQUIREMENTS
*

To provide the foundation for a strategic plan, the federal
government should aggregate and consider specific data needs
from all major data users. Options for strengthening the
process for setting data requirements include:

o  developing methods to increase the interactions among
users, designers, and operators of remote sensing systems,

o  involving a broader range of users in discussions of
requirements, and

o  developing a formal process for revising agency satellite
programs in response to emerging capabilities and needs from
a broadened user base.

*
PRIVATE SECTOR
*

A strategic plan for Earth observations should capitalize on
the expertise resident in private industry. The collection
of private firms that supply data-processing and -
interpretation services is small but growing rapidly. In
setting requirements for future remote sensing systems, the
federal government may wish to take into account the needs
of private-sector data users, who provide an important
source of innovative applications of remotely sensed data.

U.S. firms are now developing land and ocean sensing systems
with new capabilities. If private systems succeed
commercially, they are likely to change the nature and scope
of the data market dramatically. Congress could assist the
remote sensing industry and enhance its international
competitiveness by:

o  directing federal agencies to purchase data rather than
systems from private industry,

o  providing oversight to ensure that federal agencies do
not compete with industry in developing software, providing
analytic services, and developing remote sensing systems,
and

o  supporting the development of advanced technologies to
assist government remote sensing programs and private-sector
needs.

*
INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION
*

To reduce costs and improve the effectiveness of remote
sensing programs, a strategic plan should include mechanisms
for exploiting international capabilities. The open exchange
of data is essential to international cooperation in remote
sensing, especially for weather forecasting, global change
research, ocean monitoring, and other applications that
require data on a global scale. To enhance the benefits of
international cooperation in remote sensing, the United
States could consider pursuing one or more of the following:

o  increase U.S. efforts to promote sharing of data gathered
from national systems,

o  participate in a formal international division of labor,
which would allow countries to specialize in the types of
data they collect, and

o  support development of an international remote sensing
agency, to which each participating nation would contribute
funding to develop an international satellite system.

*
DATA COLLECTION
*

As part of its strategic plan, the United States needs to
improve its programs for:

o  collecting atmospheric data to support weather
forecasting and severe-weather warning,

o  monitoring the land surface,

o  monitoring the oceans and ice caps,

o  collecting data to support research on global
environmental change, and

o  monitoring key indicators of global change and
environmental quality over decades.

*
CONVERGING THE POLAR-ORBITING
METEOROLOGICAL SATELLITE SYSTEMS
*

The Clinton Administration's plan to consolidate the two
polar-orbiting systems operated by the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Department of
Defense (DOD) is one important component of a broader
strategic plan. DOD, NOAA, and NASA will contribute
personnel and funding to an Integrated Program Office within
NOAA, which will operate the converged polar-orbiting
system.

This proposal arose from the desire to reduce program
redundancy and costs. Yet, convergence of the agencies'
satellite programs into a single program could have several
benefits even if it achieved no cost savings. These include
the institutionalization of mechanisms for moving research
instruments into operational use, the development of long-
term environmental monitoring programs, and the
strengthening of international partnerships.

The convergence plan would continue U.S. cooperative
relationships with Europe through Eumetsat, which plans to
operate the METOP-1 polar-orbiting meteorological satellite
system beginning in 2000. The plan also increases U.S.
dependence on Europe for meteorological data. DOD's desire
to control the flow of data from U.S. sensors aboard the
Eumetsat METOP during times of crisis may impede the
completion of a U.S.-Eumetsat agreement. In the future, the
United States and Eumetsat may wish to expand their
cooperative satellite program by including Japan and/or
Russia as partners.

The U.S. government has few examples of successful long-
term, multiagency programs. Ensuring stable funding and
stable management in programs that now involve multiple
agencies and multiple congressional authorization and
appropriations committees will challenge Congress and the
Administration. Nevertheless, convergence of the polar-
orbiting programs could serve as an important experiment in
determining the feasibilty of developing and executing a
long-term strategic plan for Earth observations.

*
LAND REMOTE SENSING
*

Despite significant advances in remote sensing technology
and the steady growth of a market for data, the United
States continues to approach the Landsat program more as a
research effort than a fully operational one. As currently
structured, the Landsat program is vulnerable to a launch-
vehicle or spacecraft failure. It has also suffered from
instability in management and funding. The current
management arrangement, in which responsibility for
satellite procurement, operation, and data distribution is
split among NASA, NOAA, and the U.S. Geological Survey,
risks failure should differences of opinion about the value
of Landsat arise among these agencies or the appropriations
committees of the House and Senate.

High system costs have prevented the U.S. government from
committing to a fully operational land remote sensing
system. To reduce taxpayer costs, the government could:

o  return to an Eosat-like arrangement, in which the
government supplies a system subsidy but allows the firm to
sell the data at market prices,

o  contract with industry suppliers to provide data of
specified character and quality,

o  create a public-private joint venture in which the
government and one or more private firms cooperate in
developing a land remote sensing system, and/or

o  lead the development of an international land remote
sensing system with one or more foreign partners.

*
OCEAN AND ICE REMOTE SENSING
*

The United States may eventually wish to provide ocean and
ice data on an operational basis. Not only do NASA, NOAA,
and DOD have applications for scientific and operational
data, but so also do ocean fishing companies, private
shipping firms, and operators of ocean platforms. Europe,
Japan, and Canada are emerging as primary sources of ocean
and ice data for research and operational purposes. If
Congress wishes to support a U.S. commitment to civilian
operational ocean and ice monitoring, it could direct NASA,
NOAA, and DOD to:

o  broaden their scope for monitoring ocean and ice on
existing systems,

o  develop a comprehensive national ocean observation
system,

o  take part in developing an international ocean monitoring
system,

o  purchase data from commercial satellite operators, or

o  rely primarily on data exchanges with other countries.

***********************************************************

For more than two decades physicians, researchers, and
government officials have claimed that the most costly
result of the U.S. medical malpractice system is the
practice of defensive medicine.

Such claims notwithstanding, the extent of defensive
medicine and its impact on health care costs remain matters
of controversy.

This Office of Technology Assessment (OTA) report explores
the extent to which defensive medicine influences medical
practice and examines how various system reforms might alter
these behaviors.

OTA addressed the following questions:

o  What is defensive medicine and how can it be measured?

o  What are the causes of defensive medicine?

o  How widespread is defensive medicine today?

o  What effect will current proposals for malpractice
reform have on defensive medicine?

o  What are the implications of other aspects of health
care reform for defensive medicine?

**************************************
*  DEFINITION OF DEFENSIVE MEDICINE  *
**************************************

OTA defines defensive medicine as follows:

When doctors order tests, procedures, or visits, or avoid
high-risk patients or procedures, primarily (but not
necessarily solely) to reduce their exposure to malpractice
liability.

When physicians do extra tests or procedures primarily to
reduce malpractice liability, they are practicing positive
defensive medicine. When they avoid certain patients or
procedures, they are practicing negative defensive medicine.

Some important points to remember about this definition are:

o  Fear of malpractice doesn't have to be the only factor
influencing a clinical decision for that decision to be
defensive.

o  Physicians may not be conscious that they are
practicing defensive medicine because over time practices
that were originally motivated by fear of liability become
medically accepted.

o  Defensive medicine is not always of no benefit.  OTA
found that concerns about malpractice liability push
physicians' tolerance for uncertainty to their lowest
possible limits.

*************************************************
*  FULL EXTENT AND COSTS OF DEFENSIVE MEDICINE  *
*        CANNOT BE MEASURED ACCURATELY          *
*************************************************

There is simply no acceptable method for measuring the full
extent and national cost of defensive medicine. Anyone who
claims to estimate such costs fails to acknowledge the
shortcomings of the methods and data available. All such
estimates known to OTA are unreliable and may either grossly
under- or overestimate the extent or costs of defensive
medicine.

Consider, for example, the many surveys that ask physicians
directly how often they practice defensive medicine.  These
surveys, conducted by numerous state and national physician
societies in the past 10 years or so, inevitably prompt
physicians to respond with the answer most likely to elicit
a favorable political response and thus probably exaggerate
their true level of concern about medical malpractice.

Not only are they likely to exaggerate the true level of
defensive medicine, but physicians are also very sensitive
to the wording of questions.  In 11 surveys conducted by
state medical societies in the 1980s, between 21 and 81
percent of responding physicians said they practiced
positive defensive medicine.

Cost estimates based on surveys such as these cannot be
relied upon. But there are equally important problems in all
approaches to measuring the extent and costs of defensive
medicine. The best that can be done, OTA concluded, is to
develop a rough estimate of certain components of defensive
medicine.

OTA estimated an upper bound on the percentage of diagnostic
procedures that are caused primarily by physicians'
conscious concern about malpractice liability.  This
estimate should be viewed as qualitative, since there is no
way of knowing exactly how many diagnostic procedures are
consciously done because of fear of liability only that it
is likely to be less than the upper bound. Furthermore, an
upper bound on the percent of diagnostic testing
attributable to conscious concern about malpractice
liability does not translate into an upper bound on the cost
of that testing. One cannot know the exact mix of diagnostic
tests performed for defensive medicine reasons.

The upper bound on the frequency of diagnostic defensive
medicine was derived by OTA using clinical scenario surveys.
Based on physicians' responses to these surveys, OTA
concluded that less than 8 percent of diagnostic procedures
are consciously defensive in nature. (See the next section
for a description of OTA's scenario surveys.)

*************************************
*  OTA's CLINICAL SCENARIO SURVEYS  *
*************************************

OTA collaborated with three medical specialty societies to
survey their member physicians about the clinical actions
they would take in selected hypothetical clinical
situations. These "clinical scenario" surveys presented
physicians with descriptions of simulated patients and asked
them to choose among specified clinical actions.

One big advantage of this approach over the more general
surveys of defensive medicine is that the potential for
prompting may be lower if malpractice liability is only one
among several listed reasons. Another advantage is that
scenarios can focus in on areas where defensive medicine is
thought to be a major problem. Finally, because they ask
more concrete questions about particular clinical
situations, scenario surveys may be more reliable indicators
of the extent of defensive medicine in those particular
situations.

Yet this approach is not perfect. Even when physicians are
asked in a neutral survey questionnaire what clinical
actions they would take and why, they might be influenced by
the mere mention of "malpractice concerns" as a listed
reason.  And, to the extent that physicians are not
consciously aware of the role that liability concerns played
in setting the standards by which they practice, they will
underestimate its importance in a survey of this kind.

****************************
*  CHOOSING THE SCENARIOS  *
****************************

The clinical scenarios were developed by expert panels
convened by each of the three specialty societies. Panel
members were asked to identify as many clinical scenarios as
they could in a two-hour period in which defensive medicine
was likely to play a major role in their own or their
colleagues' clinical decisions.

The three panels identified over 75 scenarios, all of which
involved a patient presenting with a probable minor
condition but with a small chance of a potentially very
serious or fatal condition.

Each candidate scenario was assessed by the panel, and two
or three scenarios were selected for use in the society's
final survey. Table 1 gives examples of three out of the
nine specific clinical scenarios selected for the surveys.

CHEST PAIN (AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY)

Patient history:  A 42-year-old man arrives at the emergency
room complaining of chest pain.  The pain is on his left
side and is worse when he changes position.  While it is
sore to the touch, he states that it feels "deep."  The pain
has persisted for one hour.  He has not experienced chest
pain previously.  He jogs three times a week and does not
smoke.  He had a normal routine physical examination a week
ago.

Physical examination:  The patient is tense and anxious.
His BP (blood pressure) is 140/80; heart rate 80.  The
anterior chest wall is tender over the left sternal border.
Examination of the heart and lung is normal.

Additional data:  A 12-lead ECG (electrocardiogram) and CXR
(chest x-ray) are normal.  Laboratory tests including a cbc
(complete blood count) electrolytes and cardiac enzymes are
normal.

HEAD TRAUMA (AMERICAN COLLEGE OF SURGEONS)

History of present illness:  A 15-year-old boy fell from his
skateboard after riding over a crack in the sidewalk.  He
hit his head, got up and skated home.  Thirty minutes after
the fall he told his mother about the incident and she
brings him to the ER.  In the ER, the patient admits to
light-headedness and some tenderness at the site of impact.

Physical examination:  There is an area of tenderness and
swelling at left parietal area.  Mental status and
neurological exam are normal.

ACOG COMPLICATED DELIVERY (AMERICAN COLLEGE OF OBSTETRICIANS
AND GYNECOLOGISTS)

History:  A 36-year-old primigravida presents at 36 weeks
gestation after an uncomplicated pregnancy.

Clinical course:  The patient has had 12 hours of labor, and
is now 3 hours into the second stage.  She has been
receiving oxytocin augmentation for secondary arrest of
dilation since 7 cm.  She is completely dilated and effaced
at +2 station, ROP (right occiput posterior position).
There has been no change in the exam for over an hour.
Moderate variable decelerations have been present for the
last 30 minutes with good beat-to-beat variability.
Estimated fetal weight is 7.5 lbs. and clinical pelvimetry
is adequate.  The patient is fatigued and can no longer
push.

SOURCE:  Office of Technology Assessment, 1994.
***********************************************************

********************
*  SURVEY RESULTS  *
********************

Across the scenarios, between 5 and 29 percent of all
responding physicians cited malpractice concerns as the
primary reason for choosing at least one clinical action.
The scenario with the greatest evidence of defensive
medicine was that of a 15-year-old boy with a minor head
injury resulting from a skateboard accident.  In that case,
almost one-half of all respondents reported that they would
order a computed tomography (CT) scan, and 45 percent of
those who said they would order it would do so primarily out
of concern for malpractice.

Across all of the 54 possible "interventionist" clinical
actions in the nine scenarios, excluding waiting or doing
nothing, 23 had rates of defensive medicine in excess of 10
percent.  Across these 23 clinical actions, physicians who
said they would order the procedure said they would do so
primarily out of concern about malpractice between 11 and 53
percent of the time (figure 1).

In one-half of the 54 clinical actions, 8 percent or more of
the physicians who said they would take the action would do
so out of concern about malpractice.  In the other one-half
of all clinical actions, less than 8 percent would do so out
of malpractice concern.

Because these scenarios were explicitly chosen to evoke
concern about liability and two of the three specialty
societies have relatively high exposure to malpractice
liability, OTA is confident that the actual proportion of
diagnostic testing that is consciously defensive is less
than 8 percent of all diagnostic procedures.  How much less,
however, is impossible to know.

Little as is known about what aspects of the malpractice
system actually drive physicians to practice defensively.
Thus, predicting the impact of any proposal for malpractice
reform on defensive medicine is very difficult.

Do physicians practice defensively because they dislike
having their clinical decisions called into question?  Is it
court trials that physicians fear, or is it the possibility,
no matter how remote in reality, of being financially ruined
by a malpractice suit?  Or is it the belief that the legal
system offers no clear guidelines on how to avoid liability?

The importance of each of these factors in explaining why
doctors practice defensively will determine the effect of
specific reforms on defensive medicine. For example, if
physicians are afraid mainly of court proceedings and jury
trials, reforms that eliminate court trials might reduce
defensive medicine. But if physicians abhor the prospect of
having to defend their clinical actions in any forum, then
moving malpractice claims out of the court system might do
little to alter defensive practices.

******************************
*  TRADITIONAL TORT REFORMS  *
******************************

Over the past 20 years, almost every state has passed some
type of medical malpractice tort reform. The "traditional"
tort reforms enacted by many states have, for the most part,
tinkered with the details of the existing system, leaving
malpractice cases in the court system.

The goal of most of these state-level reforms has been to
reduce malpractice insurance premiums by limiting the number
of claims, the costs of resolving a claim, or the damages
that can be paid.

The traditional reforms adopted most widely include:

o  shortening the statute of limitations,

o  limiting plaintiffs' attorney fees,

o  requiring or allowing pretrial screening of claims,

o  placing caps on damages,

o  amending the collateral source rule (requiring or
permitting the jury to reduce awards by amounts received
from other insurers), and

o  periodic payment of damages (instead of upfront lump-
sum payment).

All but 12 states have in place one or more of three popular
reforms (figure 2).  Although some conventional reforms
effectively reduce malpractice insurance premiums, evidence
of their effect on defensive medicine is weak.

The best evidence that physicians' behavior can be altered
by reducing the frequency of claims or the amounts that can
be recovered comes from a study of the impact of malpractice
risk on Caesarean delivery rates in New York State in 1984.
That study found a systematic relationship between the
strength of various malpractice risk measures (i.e., claim
frequency and insurance premiums) and Caesarean delivery
rates. It is unknown how far these findings can be
generalized to other states, specialties, clinical
situations, or procedures especially given that other
studies funded by OTA failed to find a correlation between
malpractice risk and clinical behavior.

The major problem with the traditional tort reforms is that
their effect on defensive medicine is not very well
targeted. While they may reduce physicians' general
anxieties about being sued, these reforms do not send
specific signals about which defensive practices are more or
less appropriate. Thus, to the extent that they do reduce
defensive medicine, they may do so indiscriminately,
reducing appropriate as well as inappropriate practices.

**********************************
*  CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES  *
**********************************

One malpractice reform that can target wasteful and low-
benefit defensive medicine is to enhance the evidentiary
status in court cases of clinical practice guidelines
covering situations in which defensive medicine is a major
problem.

The use of clinical practice guidelines as the legal
standard of care is being tested in a small number of
states. In Maine, for example, 17 guidelines developed by
the state's physicians can be used as a complete defense
against an allegation of negligence if it can be shown that
the defendant adhered to the guidelines (see table 2).

Evidence is beginning to emerge that the Maine initiative
has reduced defensive medicine in selected procedures (for
example, cervical spine x-rays in emergency rooms).  Because
the number of clinical situations to which such guidelines
can apply is limited, however, this approach is not likely
to have a big impact on total health care costs.

***********************************************************

*********************
*  OTHER PROPOSALS  *
*********************

Recent proposals for malpractice reform involve changes in
the relationships among the parties to malpractice suits or
in the process of resolving the suit. They include the
following:

Enterprise Liability, in which the health care institution
assumes responsibility for physicians' malpractice claims.

Alternative Dispute Resolution, in which arbitrators or non-
judicial forums substitute for court proceedings.

Selective No-Fault, in which certain injuries are
compensated automatically.

These approaches to malpractice reform have not been
adequately tested, and the net direction of their potential
effects on defensive medicine is uncertain.

********************************************************
*  DEFENSIVE MEDICINE IN AN ERA OF HEALTH CARE REFORM  *
********************************************************

For all its problems, the medical malpractice system is
designed to hold the medical profession to an acceptable
level of quality by deterring negligence.  Whether the
current system achieves this objective is a matter of
debate. Nevertheless, a "reformed" health care system may
establish new incentives to do less rather than more.
Simultaneous reform of the medical malpractice system could
remove a deterrent to providing too little care at the very
time such mechanisms are most needed.

Ultimately two questions must be answered as the United
States moves to a new health care system:

o  What level of medical risk are the American people
willing to bear for the sake of cost containment?

o  What quality assurance mechanisms should be used to
decide on and enforce adherence to that level?

Under the malpractice system as it is currently configured,
juries help decide the acceptable level of medical risk.
Better methods may, indeed, exist, but until such
alternatives are tried and tested, the advisability of major
changes in the malpractice system is a policy issue that
deserves careful consideration.

********************
*  POLICY OPTIONS  *
********************

A reasonable goal of federal policy would be to reduce
physicians' ability or incentives to engage (either
consciously or unconsciously) in defensive practices whose
benefits to patients are not worth their costs.  Finding
specific policies that move the health care system toward
that goal is not so easy, however.

Below are four specific options for addressing the problem
of defensive medicine.  Each is imperfect, some more so than
others. Certain of these options provide a sharper scalpel
than others for excising the "bad" defensive practices while
retaining the "good."

OPTION 1:  Reduce the strength of the malpractice signal by
mandating traditional tort reforms that limit plaintiffs'
access to the courts or potential compensation.

Any tort reform that makes it more difficult to prove
liability or less remunerative for a plaintiff to pursue a
malpractice case should reduce claim frequency or payouts.
That malpractice premiums are lower in the presence of these
reforms is therefore not surprising. But small changes in
frequency of claims or premiums probably will not have a
significant impact on behavior. And traditional reforms do
not target the defensive medical practices that are the
least medically beneficial.

OPTION 2: Consider permanent changes in malpractice law only
after the structure of the health care system under federal
health care reform has been settled.

A "go-slow" approach to malpractice reform would permit
state and federal policymakers to assess the incentives and
quality assurance mechanisms inherent in health care reform
before changing the basic structure of the malpractice
system. But this approach could also put the malpractice
system in direct conflict with the incentives inherent in
health care reform. The physician could be pushed to
conserve resources without being provided legal protection
for those decisions. This could lead to new tensions among
physicians, patients, and patients' health plans.

OPTION 3: Promote predictability in the legal standard of
care for defensive clinical situations using practice
guidelines.

The development and enhanced use as evidence in the courts
of clinical practice guidelines covering situations in which
defensive medicine plays a substantial role will be useful
regardless of the shape of health care reform.

The overall impact on health care practices is likely to be
small, however, because only a few clinical situations
permit the development of guidelines with sufficient
specificity to provide clear-cut clinical guidance and legal
protection.

OPTION 4: Establish demonstration projects of malpractice
reforms that either remove or limit the physician's
involvement in the litigation process.

Because of many uncertainties about the impact of reforms
such as enterprise liability, alternative dispute
resolution, or selective no-fault on defensive medicine,
malpractice costs and the quality of health care, state-
level demonstrations may be warranted to evaluate these more
innovative alternatives before full-scale commitment to any
particular model.

Union, has taken similar steps. The United States and Russia
have pledged to continue their programs of weapons
retirement and warhead dismantlement, and are discussing
methods of defining and achieving long-term goals.

Existing and pending international agreements do not require
that any warheads be dismantled, only that they be removed
from delivery systems. The Nation's massive nuclear
stockpile is now partly dismantled, partly in temporary
storage, partly in transition, and partly deployed. The
status and future use of materials removed from warheads is
uncertain. Numbers of weapons in the active stockpile, and
numbers to be retired and dismantled, are contained in
classified documents not available to the general public.

Such efforts are unprecedented and challenging; they require
resources and talent as well as enduring dedication within
Government institutions. People are concerned that the work
be conducted so as to avoid the types of adverse
environmental and health impacts that resulted from nuclear
weapons production in the past. Experts have been
investigating how to use, control, or dispose of the nuclear
materials--plutonium and highly enriched uranium (HEU)--that
are recovered from dismantled warheads and could pose long-
term environmental, safety, and health risks. The OTA report
Dismantling the Bomb and Managing the Nuclear Materials
analyzes the current programs and policies and evaluates the
prospects for future success.

Although current Federal efforts are adequate for the
present, they are insufficient to meet the long-term
challenge ahead. OTA concludes that the success of future
warhead dismantlement and materials management requires a
focused, high-level governmental effort to develop a
comprehensive national policy. It also requires an open
decisionmaking process and capable institutions to set and
implement long-range goals and plans. OTA suggests
initiatives that Congress could consider to establish a
national policy, determine the next steps in warhead
dismantlement and nuclear materials management, approach
decisions on the ultimate disposition of nuclear materials,
enhance the institutional capabilities necessary to ensure
success, and encourage sound dismantlement and materials
management in Russia.

******************
*  KEY FINDINGS  *
******************

	o  Ongoing Federal programs and plans within the
Departments of Defense and Energy for retirement and
dismantlement of nuclear weapons are currently treated as a
short-term modification of past missions of weapon
production and stockpile maintenance when, in fact, there is
a new type of mission focused on stockpile reduction. There
is no national policy to define and guide this new mission.

	o  A continuing lack of public credibility on the part
of Federal agencies and limited public access to relevant
information may adversely affect progress in dismantlement
and in implementing key operational decisions. Yet, despite
new public participation initiatives, DOE has yet to develop
adequate communication with the public, ensure access to
environment, health, and safety information, involve the
public before making key decisions, or effectively address
public concerns.

	o  It is likely that significant portions of the HEU
and plutonium recovered from dismantled warheads will need
to be stored for decades, regardless of the ultimate
disposition option chosen for them, and a broadly based
planning process should begin soon to identify and resolve
critical storage issues.

	o  Decades will be required for making disposition
decisions and formulating policies; for planning, designing,
funding, building, and testing even the most available
technology; for gaining regulatory and public acceptance;
and for actually processing quantities of materials.
Consensus is lacking about whether surplus warhead materials
should be stored indefinitely, converted into forms usable
for commercial power generation, or disposed of as waste,
and about the technical, economic, and political merits of
various disposition options and technologies. A process for
openly discussing and reconciling diverse governmental and
nongovernmental perspectives on these issues is needed.

	o  The U.S. program to assist Russia with nuclear
warhead dismantlement has initiated important cooperative
work but has not addressed the broader issues of mutual
goals and interests in stockpile and materials reduction or
control, nor has it had a significant effect on Russian
dismantlement. There is little linkage between Russian
economic, environmental, or social needs and U.S. programs
to assist and encourage Russian dismantlement or related
activities. A focused, coordinated strategy within the
Federal Government is needed to develop approaches
acceptable to both nations.

************************
*  Policy Initiatives  *
************************

Congress could implement--or the Administration could
undertake to implement--the following policy initiatives:

********************************************
*  Initiative 1--A National Dismantlement  *
*  Policy                                  *
********************************************

Develop and announce a national policy that sets goals for
warhead dismantlement and materials management, and
specifies the amount of plutonium and HEU from dismantled
warheads that will not be needed to support future stockpile
requirements.

*************************************
*  Initiative 2--Strengthening DOE  *
*  Management                       *
*************************************

Implement a DOE management system that gives priority to
protecting the environment, health, and safety; and expand
and strengthen external oversight of DOE dismantlement and
materials management activities by independent outside
entities.

*********************************************
*  Initiative 3--Nuclear Materials Storage  *
*********************************************

Establish an interagency task force that includes Federal
agencies with expertise in regulatory, international, and
public involvement matters to recommend a plan for safe,
secure storage of nuclear materials, and to develop a
process acceptable to the interested public for siting new
or modified storage facilities.

*************************************
*  Initiative 4--Nuclear Materials  *
*  Disposition                      *
*************************************

Create a national commission to recommend goals, policies,
and programs for ultimate disposition of surplus plutonium
and HEU from warheads, and to provide a basis for developing
an ultimate disposition policy for these materials.

***********************************
*  Initiative 5--A New Materials  *
*  Management Organization        *
***********************************

Create a new organization outside DOE to manage surplus
materials from warheads, or establish a new organization for
this purpose within DOE or some other existing agency.

**************************************
*  Initiative 6--Information Access  *
**************************************

Review and possibly revise the existing legal basis for
restricting access to information in light of today's post-
Cold War national security objectives, and accelerate
efforts to increase access to information relevant to
warhead dismantlement and materials disposition.

*******************************************
*  Initiative 7--Cooperation with Russia  *
*******************************************

Strengthen the relationship between U.S. assistance to
Russia for materials disposition and other programs in which
assistance is desired by Russia; develop a means for joint
assessment of plutonium disposition technologies; and
negotiate mutual disclosure of information and reciprocal
materials monitoring arrangements.

*      ELECTRONIC ENTERPRISES:  LOOKING TO THE FUTURE     *
***********************************************************

Electronic transactions are now commonplace in the U.S.
business environment.  Consumers use electronic technologies
daily to transfer funds, make credit card purchases, buy
stock, and browse electronic catalogues.  Businesses, too,
rely heavily on electronic technology for recordkeeping,
accounting, inventory control, production management, and
purchasing and sales.  OTA's Electronic Enterprises:
Looking to the Future concludes, however, that this use of
networked information technology barely hints at its full
potential for improving U.S. economic performance.

Competition from abroad has forced American businesses to
seek new, more productive ways to organize their operations
and carry out their work. These include total quality
control, customer-driven planning, lean production, agile
manufacturing, just-in-time manufacturing, and electronic
integrated enterprises.  An advanced communication and
information infrastructure, such as that embodied in the
concept of a National Information Infrastructure (NII),
could greatly enhance these new management and production
tools and improve overall U.S. economic performance.

This report identifies and frames the technological,
economic, and social issues related to the use of electronic
networks for business and commerce.  It focuses on the
features that must become part of an NII, as well as the
social and economic conditions needed to support it.  In an
electronically networked economy, the design and underlying
architecture of the global information infrastructure will
have a major impact on national economic growth and
development.  However, if all American businesses--large and
small, national and multinational, service and
manufacturing--are to fully benefit from electronic
commerce, national infrastructure policy must also consider
the social and economic factors associated with its use.

**********************************************
*  POTENTIAL IMPACTS OF ELECTRONIC NETWORKS  *
**********************************************

Networked information technologies are especially useful in
helping firms to restructure and reengineer their operations
to become more competitive.  Businesses are using these
technologies to reorganize their activities into more
versatile and flexible networks and teams.  Some businesses,
for example, are using networking technologies to build
long-term, integrated business relationships with their
customers and suppliers.  Others are teaming up with outside
firms for specific, short term ventures.  Some of these
business relationships, operating through electronic
networks, cross national as well as organizational
boundaries.  Networking technologies such as wide area
networks (WANs), videoconferencing, computer-integrated
engineering and manufacturing, and electronic data
interchange (EDI) are necessary to support these flexible
business arrangements.

While information and communication technologies have an
impact on how firms conduct their business, they will also
affect the size, structure, and openness of markets.  As
these technologies are integrated into reliable commercial
networks, more trade will take place online in electronic
markets.  How these electronic markets evolve and the form
they take will have significant consequences for the
functioning of the economy as a whole.  Electronic markets
can reduce the net costs of doing business, and thus improve
overall efficiency and expand trade.  However, if these
networks fail to interconnect, or are unevenly deployed,
they could create technological barriers to trade and
restrict competition.

************************************
*  TECHNICAL CRITERIA FOR SUCCESS  *
************************************

The "architecture of electronic networks will be critical in
determining the impacts of electronic commerce.  Information
networking technologies will need to be varied, flexible,
open, and easily interconnected if they are to serve
business and the nation's needs.  Flexibility and choice
allow businesses to move quickly and strategically to
respond to changing circumstances and market demand, and to
mix and match network components to develop new products and
services.  Open, interoperable systems, which can be easily
interconnected, reduce business transaction costs and
barriers to market entry.  Technology diffusion will also
occur faster and more broadly because interoperable
components are cheaper and easier to use.  In addition,
interoperable systems provide a standard platform for the
innovation and development of new components and
applications.

If everyone is to share the benefits of electronic networks,
the technology must also be widely deployed.  The first
developer of a commerce network can gain a significant
competitive advantage, if investment costs are high and the
market is limited.  Potential competitors may be unable to
attract enough users to justify the cost of establishing
additional networks.  Latecomers in the business network
game will also be disadvantaged because hey lack the hands-
on experience needed for network development and operation.
Although the profits gained from an early competitive
advantage may stimulate further network investment, this
competitive advantage could lead to anticompetitive behavior
if too many newcomers are discouraged or locked out of the
market.

************************************
*  TECHNOLOGY ALONE IS NOT ENOUGH  *
************************************

The most sophisticated technology and the best designed
network architecture will not achieve their potential payoff
unless businesses change their attitudes and business
procedures.  Fortunately, new communication and information
technologies are subversive; they can serve as agents of
change, helping firms to make the necessary adjustments.  In
a networked business environment, cooperation among firms
can prove more rewarding than unbridled competition, and
information-sharing more fruitful than information control.
Moreover, with the rapid social, economic, and technology
changes taking place, the most successful businesses will
likely be those that use information technologies to adapt
to their changing environment, rather than to control
situations and events.

The shift from mass production to customized, flexible
production will require a highly skilled and flexible
workforce.  Information technologies can affect the
workplace in one of two entirely different ways.  Management
can use technology counterproductively to monitor workers,
reduce skill levels, or replace permanent workers with
contingent labor.  Or these same technologies can be used
beneficially to improve workers' skills, integrate employees
into the decision process, and encourage team participation.
If the benefits of electronic commerce are to be realized,
business strategies will need to foster job quality, wages
to support a high living standard, and a collaborative work
environment.

****************************************************
*  IMPLICATIONS OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY CHOICES  *
****************************************************

The age-old adage that "knowledge is power" is nowhere more
applicable than in a knowledge-based society. Whether in
work relationships within a firm, competition in the
marketplace, or trading relations among nations, having
access to information and the ability to use it are the keys
to success or failure.

What is different today is the extent to which knowledge is
now embedded in information and communication technologies.
As a result, choices about the design, architecture and
structure, or the rules and regulations of network
technologies will be irreversible in the short- to medium-
term.  This is particularly true for networked information
technologies, which require huge amounts of sunk capital and
social investment.  Thus, this period of rapid technological
advancement provides a rare opportunity to assess and direct
technological developments and the economic and social
relationships associated with them.  With the stakes high,
and the potential for winners and losers, care must be given
not only to the choice of technologies, but also to the
participants in the decisionmaking process.

************************************
*  POTENTIAL ROLES FOR GOVERNMENT  *
************************************

With major changes in the world economy, all nations are
rethinking their government's responsibility for maintaining
their economies.  Russia and the Republics of the former
Soviet Union and Eastern Block are undergoing the most
dramatic readjustment to free markets.  Europe is struggling
with the transition to a single, unified market where
national governments play a lesser role.  Japan is
experiencing similar doubts and reservations about its
economic future, while trying to sort out its government's
role in pulling the country out of a severe recession.

The United States faces its own global readjustment.  This
will require moving beyond the unproductive debate about
whether the nation should have an "industrial policy" to
identifying the joint interests of business and government
and how they can mutually support one another.  Government
has always had a role--and cannot avoid its involvement--in
structuring economic relations and outcomes.

In the context of the National Information Infrastructure,
the private sector clearly has the primary role for
developing, deploying, and operating the NII.  In the
government's role as regulator, it will need to ensure that
electronic markets are evenly deployed, open, and accessible
on an equitable basis.  Acting as a broker, the government
can bring together potential, but disparate, network users,
thereby helping to generate a critical mass. As a promoter,
the government can take steps to overcome market failures.
As an educator, the government can promote electronic
commerce by fostering demand through the effective use of
networking technologies.  Finally, and most importantly, the
government can create an institutional environment that
strives to assure that electronic commerce is conducted in a
manner consistent with the nation's overall social and
economic objectives.

ENERGY EFFICIENCY: CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR ELECTRIC
UTILITIES--REPORT BRIEF

***********************************************************
America's electric utilities are finding that helping their
customers use energy more efficiently can be a cost-
effective and reliable alternative for meeting electricity
demand growth. The opportunities for efficiency improvements
are myriad and potential savings real, but consumers and
utilities have been slow to invest in the most cost-
effective energy-efficient technologies available. OTA's
report, Energy Efficiency: Challenges and Trends for
Electric Utilities, examines the prospects for advancing
U.S. energy efficiency through technology improvements and
regulatory changes in the utility sector and related Federal
and State initiatives.

The energy efficiency of today's buildings and electric
equipment and appliances falls far short of what is
technically attainable. This efficiency gap has been
attributed to a variety of market, institutional, technical,
and behavioral constraints. Electric utility energy
efficiency programs have great potential to narrow this gap
and achieve significant energy savings.

Utility energy efficiency programs also promise savings for
consumers and utilities, profits for shareholders,
improvements in industrial productivity, enhanced
international competitiveness, and reduced environmental
impacts. But along with opportunities, greater reliance on
energy efficiency as a resource to meet future electricity
needs also entails risks_that efficient technologies will
not perform as well as promised, that anticipated savings
will not be truly cost-effective in practice, and that the
costs and benefits of energy-efficiency programs will not be
shared equitably among utility customers.

**************************************
*  MEETING FUTURE ELECTRICITY NEEDS  *
**************************************

In 1992 utility power generation accounted for 36 percent of
total primary energy use in the United States, and
electricity consumption is growing faster than overall
energy use. Current growth forecasts range from 1 to 3.5
percent per year over the next decade.  Meeting this new
demand could require construction of the equivalent of 50 to
220 new 1,000-megawatt powerplants over 10 years. The
differences in estimated new capacity needs reflect hundreds
of billions of dollars for utility ratepayers. Of course,
future electricity demand growth rates are uncertain, adding
to the risks that utilities face in planning and building
for the future.

Energy efficiency advocates have long maintained that it can
be cheaper for ratepayers and better for the environment and
society to save energy rather than build new powerplants.
This view is now embraced by many utilities, regulators,
shareholders, and customers and is already shaping our
future. With more than 10 years of experience with utility
energy efficiency programs, initial results are promising,
but many uncertainties remain.

Efforts to harness the utility sector to achieve greater
energy efficiency have focused on three strategies:

	o  Demand-side management (DSM) programs_utility-led
efforts intended to affect the timing or amount of customer
energy use. Examples include rebates, loans, energy audits,
utility installation of efficient equipment, and load
management programs.

	o  Integrated resource planning (IRP)_a technique used
by utilities and regulators to develop flexible plans for
providing reliable and economic electricity supply through a
process that explicitly compares supply- and demand-side
resource options on a consistent basis and usually has
opportunities for public participation.

	o  Regulatory incentives for investment in energy
saving technologies adopted to offset the bias against
energy efficiency investments in traditional ratemaking
methods. Typically, utility profits have been based on the
total value of capital invested and the amount of power
sold_creating a strong financial disincentive against energy
efficiency or other investments that could reduce power
sales and utility revenues. Examples include mechanisms
decoupling utility revenues from power sales, cost recovery
or ratebasing of efficiency program expenditures, and
performance bonuses and penalties.

Over 30 States have adopted utility IRP and DSM
requirements, and programs are being developed rapidly in
most of the remaining States.

********************
*  ENERGY SAVINGS  *
********************

There are ample untapped and cost-effective opportunities to
use electricity more efficiently in all sectors of the U.S.
economy. Energy efficiency investments  allow consumers to
avoid the costs and pollution from new powerplants while
still enjoying the same level of energy services_warm
showers, cold drinks, comfortable surroundings and a
vigorous economy.

The most promising energy-saving opportunities include
improved building thermal integrity, more efficient electric
equipment, high-efficiency lighting technologies, energy
management control systems, and net energy savings from
converting industrial processes from fossil fuels to
electricity.

According to various estimates, full adoption of currently
available efficiency technologies could save from 20 to 45
percent of present electricity use by the year 2000. The
higher estimates would require replacing much of the
existing stock of electric equipment with the most efficient
models available and mobilization of staggering amounts of
capital to finance the transition even though it could
result in significant long-term savings in energy costs.

Even without such aggressive action, present trends in
energy efficiency gains due to energy prices, standards,
technological advances, and existing utility DSM efforts
will yield energy savings. As a result of these trends,
electricity use in 2000 is projected to be about 9 percent
less than what it would be if efficiency levels were
"frozen" at current levels. Many energy analysts believe
that energy efficient technologies can cut electricity
demand growth further and perhaps even reduce overall
electricity demand in the future.

*************************************
*  UTILITIES AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY  *
*************************************

Increasingly, utilities are finding that energy efficiency
programs make good business sense. Investments in customer
DSM measures and more efficient generation and transmission
technologies can provide reliable, flexible, and lower-cost
alternatives to conventional generating options, improve the
economic operation of existing powerplants, reduce financial
risks, and create goodwill among customers. Energy
efficiency also can be an effective environmental compliance
strategy to cut emissions of sulfur dioxides, nitrogen
oxides, carbon dioxide, and other pollutants.

With the growth of State regulatory incentives for DSM
investments, utility energy efficiency programs offer new
profit opportunities. Utility DSM programs have in fact
become big business with an estimated $2 billion spent on
DSM measures in 1991 and plans to spend significantly more
in years to come.

Utility energy efficiency investments also offer benefits to
the Nation in improved productivity, lower energy costs, and
enhanced international competitiveness of U.S. businesses.
The availability of DSM measures to displace oil-fired
generation in emergencies helps lessen our oil import
vulnerability. Moreover, demand-side efficiency investments
tend to create more jobs for lower-skilled workers than
conventional supply-side construction projects.

Well-designed and implemented utility energy efficiency
programs have demonstrated sustained, reliable, and cost-
effective electricity savings. But, there have been
disappointments, too. In many programs, participation rates
have been low and actual savings have been well below cost-
effective technical potential. Even the best programs have
experienced some gaps between technical potential and actual
savings. In part this is due to the recent vintage and
limited scope of many utility programs. In coming years,
utilities will have to narrow the savings gap and expand
customer participation to make energy efficiency programs
the true equal of new generating units and other supply-side
options in meeting customer energy needs.

DSM programs entail both technology and regulatory risks
that the savings will not be as high or as durable as
expected or that consumers will be asked to pay more than
necessary to achieve them. DSM programs and IRP methods are
evolving to take advantage of lessons learned and to target
a broader range of electricity saving opportunities.

************************
*  POLICY INITIATIVES  *
************************

Because of their jurisdiction over utility resource
decisions and retail operations, State agencies will play a
dominant role in encouraging utility energy efficiency
programs. Many States already have aggressively pursued
energy efficiency initiatives through the utility sector.
There remain, however, a number of areas where the Federal
Government can contribute. Policy initiatives for some of
these are listed in the box above.

***********************************************************

Promoting the transition of former East Bloc countries
into market-oriented, democratic partners is one of the most
important foreign policy issues facing the United States. A
successful transition can convert former enemies into
friendly trading partners, but failure could lead to the
rise of nationalistic, authoritarian regimes and dangerous
international stability.

However, the United States has limited direct influence on
the policies of these countries, especially those in Russia.
Successful economic and political reforms depend largely on
internal measures. OTA's report Fueling Reform: Energy
Technologies for the Former East Bloc concludes that energy-
related technology transfer can support U.S. objectives, but
it will be fully effective only in countries that have made
significant progress toward reform.

Improving the production and use of energy will be one of
the most critical factors in reviving these economies.
Petroleum is by far the most important export from the
region, but Russian production is declining rapidly.  In
addition, energy is used very wastefully in all the formerly
centrally planned economies, and reducing waste will relieve
them of a major financial burden.

Technology Choices

Almost the entire energy sector requires massive upgrading.
Particularly attractive opportunities for U.S. technology
include: oil and gas exploration and production, nuclear
safety, pollution control, and efficient energy use.
However, imports of equipment and technology are limited by
a lack of capital and, particularly in Russia, competition
from domestic suppliers, even those whose equipment is
distinctly inferior.

Outmoded technology has contributed to the precipitous
decline in former Soviet Union oil production.  Western
technology and resources could play an important role in the
rehabilitation of existing oil wells and the development of
new fields.  However, only a small fraction of the full
potential will be realized unless political and economic
barriers to energy technology transfer are removed.

Nuclear energy continues to be a source of serious concern.
Soviet-designed reactors are well below Western safety
standards, but they are still operated because the power is
needed.  U.S. assistance in improving safety reduces the
chance of a catastrophic nuclear accident and benefits U.S.
equipment suppliers.  However, some critics argue that no
amount of assistance will make these plants safe enough and
that any help will encourage their continued operation.

The former East Bloc contains some of the most polluted
areas of the world, and energy production and consumption
are responsible for a significant share of the problem.
Technologies to burn coal more cleanly (e.g., coal cleaning
processes and flue-gas desulfurization equipment) can
dramatically reduce the pollution.  However, assuring that
U.S. suppliers get an appropriate share of the market will
require significant government involvement.

Providing information and financial support for upgrading
energy efficiency is one of the most effective forms of
assistance.  The potential for reducing energy waste appears
to be greater than the potential for increasing energy
production, especially in the near term. Improved energy
efficiency also reduces pollution.

U.S. Policy

Energy specific goals toward the former East Bloc include:

o	market reform in the energy sector,

o	modernization of facilities and technologies in the
energy sector,

o	advancing U.S. energy-related business interests,

o	reducing energy-related pollution and threats to the
environment, and

o	augmenting world fuel supplies.

The U.S. government has already initiated a variety of
programs to support these goals.  These programs address
appropriate targets, but Congress could consider policy
options to improve the effectiveness of current activities
or expand programs that are producing the best results, as
shown in the table.  In addition, some goals conflict under
certain conditions, and Congress could provide guidance as
to the highest priorities.  In particular, options to
promote U.S. exports can interfere with efforts to promote
economic and political reform.

Policy Options

Improve Effectiveness of Current Programs

o	Upgrade administration of U.S. aid and   trade programs
by:

	--Procuring more regional expertise and   improving
sensitivity to local needs.

	--Improving coordination among agencies.

	--Streamlining procedures.

Expand the Following Effective Programs

o	Government-to-government policy assistance.

o	Business and organizational training.

o	Energy-efficiency programs.

o	Energy-related technical assistance and demonstration
programs.

o	Trade-promotion programs in countries making progress
toward reform.

Resolve Conflicting Priorities for Countries not yet
Decisively Reforming

o	Choose between two policies:

	--Support near-term economic stabilization through
expansion of energy production:  increase U.S. export-
finance programs to maximize energy output  and provide
foreign exchange, regardless of progress on economic reform.
This option aggressively emphasizes short-term U.S. exports,
but it may encourage recipients of U.S. goods and services
to avoid making hard choices necessary   for long-term
growth.

--Support long-term energy sector modernization and systemic
market reform as overriding goal: strengthen conditionality
in U.S. programs, refusing export financing and insurance to
firms and governments not reforming.  This option may limit
U.S. exports in the short term.

Improved energy technology will be a critical factor in
modernizing the economies of the former East Bloc, and the
transfer of energy technology will be an important asset in
achieving U.S. national goals.  However, internal
constraints will limit Western investment and sales of
equipment and services.  A strong and active U.S. government
role is necessary to expedite the transition to market
economies and democracy and to assure that export markets
are available for U.S. industry.  The policy options listed
above, if implemented skillfully and with adequate funding,
can help very significantly.  Congress will face the issue
of whether increased efforts are warranted in light of other
U.S. national priorities and uncertainties over progress
toward reform in Russia and other countries of the former
East Bloc.

<title>The Fusion Energy Program</title>
<H3><STRONG>Subject:</STRONG> The Fusion Energy Program</H3><PRE><H5>February 1995


Office of Technology Assessment

REPORT BRIEF

*
THE FUSION ENERGY PROGRAM:
THE ROLE OF TPX AND ALTERNATE CONCEPTS
*

Critical budgetary and strategic decisions confront the
U.S. fusion energy program.  For over four decades, the
federal government has supported research to develop fusion
for commercial electric power production (see figure 1).
Proponents note that the supply of fusion fuels is virtually
inexhaustible and that environmental impacts may turn out to
be less than those of other energy sources.  Recent
experiments at the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory's
(PPPL) Tokamak Fusion Test Reactor (TFTR) produced
unprecedented levels of fusion power, attesting to continued
progress in fusion research.

However, even the most optimistic supporters of fusion
energy concede that many scientific, engineering, and
economic challenges remain.  Whether these challenges can be
overcome is by no means guaranteed.  Just developing a
prototype commercial powerplant may require tens of billions
of dollars in research and new facilities over the next
several decades.  In fact, current plans for developing the
tokamak (the most advanced fusion energy concept) by the
middle of the 21st century imply a doubling or more of the
U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) annual fusion energy
budget from today's $373 million (see figure 2).

If current plans are pursued, the greatest single budgetary
requirement for the fusion energy program in the next
several years would be the U.S. share to build the
International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER).  If
successful, ITER would be the first device to demonstrate
controlled ignition of fusion fuel.  No decision has been
made by the ITER partners (the United States, Japan, the
European Community, and the Russian Federation) on whether
to actually build the device, estimated to cost on the order
of $10 billion, once the engineering design is completed in
1998.

More immediate than decisions on ITER, Congress must
determine the fate of two other fusion energy research
activities: 1) the Tokamak Physics Experiment (TPX), an
approximately $700 million device awaiting a congressional
decision to begin construction at PPPL; and 2) the alternate
(nontokamak) concepts research effort, which could examine
fusion energy concepts that are less scientifically and
technically developed than the tokamak, but that also
involve less costly next steps.

TOKAMAK PHYSICS EXPERIMENT

Should TPX be built on its proposed schedule, experiments
could begin in 2001.  Proponents note that TPX would provide
a focus for U.S. fusion research after TFTR retires in 1995,
and that experience building major systems such as
superconducting magnets could give U.S. industry an edge in
competing to construct ITER.  More importantly, TPX would
provide advances ultimately needed for a tokamak powerplant:
operating at near-steady state conditions, exploring
advanced operating modes that could reduce the size and cost
of a tokamak reactor, and using only superconducting
magnets.

While none of the TPX advances would be essential to ITER,
TPX experiments in near-steady-state, advanced operating
modes may shorten the schedule for such experiments at ITER,
allowing ITER to move more quickly into research areas for
which it is uniquely suited.  The savings could be
substantial given ITER's likely high operating costs and
lower flexibility.  TPX could offer tangible benefits to
ITER, but the magnitude is uncertain, and DOE has not
estimated their value.  Notably, no other partner in the
ITER project has found it essential to pursue a device with
TPX's capabilities as part of the program for successful
development of ITER.

TPX's value to the fusion energy program could increase if
ITER's schedule is delayed by several years.  TPX research
findings could then be more critical in determining tokamak
feasibility.  However, the present scheduling overlap makes
it impossible to take full advantage of TPX results in the
design and construction of ITER.  For example, potentially
costly decisions to build flexibility into ITER to explore
advanced operating modes will be made long before TPX
results would be available.

ALTERNATE CONCEPTS

Most of the effort in fusion energy research has been
devoted to the magnetic confinement approach, which uses
magnetic fields to control the fusion plasma under extremely
high temperatures and pressures.  Different magnetic fusion
energy (MFE) confinement concepts such as the tokamak, the
stellarator, the field-reversed configuration and the
reversed-field pinch have been investigated, the most
advanced of which is clearly the tokamak.  Considerable
effort has also been devoted to inertial confinement, in
which a pellet of fusion fuel would be compressed by intense
lasers or ion drivers to such high densities that the fuel's
own inertia is sufficient to contain it.  Much of the
research on inertial fusion energy (IFE) has been performed
by DOE's defense program for its applications to nuclear
weapons physics.  A variety of more novel fusion energy
concepts have been suggested that take fundamentally
different, and more scientifically speculative, approaches
including electrostatic confinement and colliding beams.

Over the past decade the fusion energy program was narrowed
to focus on the tokamak primarily for budgetary rather than
technical reasons. Operation of several existing
experimental MFE devices was restricted.  In fiscal year
1994, the civilian IFE budget was reduced by 50 percent to
$4 million, well below the level needed to continue
development despite previous successful experiments. There
is a widely held view that this narrowing of the fusion
energy program was premature and did not reflect the
benefits of pursuing alternate concepts.  There are clear
reasons for supporting an alternate concepts program
including the desire to provide a fusion energy option
should the tokamak prove technically or commercially
infeasible.

Dependence on experimental research to verify theory can
make fusion energy concept development expensive.  However,
information providing a firmer basis for future, more costly
alternate concept efforts could be developed at a modest
cost relative to the tokamak effort.  For example, with less
than 10 percent of the current fusion energy budget, broad-
ranging theoretical studies to screen prospects could be
done, use of existing alternate concepts facilities could be
resumed or accelerated, and collaborative international
efforts could be pursued.

One advanced alternate concept involving costly next steps
is IFE using a heavy-ion driver.  Its proponents suggest
that a development path for a demonstration IFE powerplant
could be substantially more flexible and less costly than
that planned for the tokamak.  While considerable
scientific, technical, and development cost uncertainties
exist, these proponents envision a civilian effort of about
$4 billion (with another $8 billion from defense programs)
spread over several facilities.  In contrast, ITER alone is
expected to cost more than that, and is only one of the
major tokamak facilities needed.  One next step for IFE is
to explore ignition physics, and depends on the National
Ignition Facility (NIF), a proposed $1 billion research
facility being pursued under DOE's defense program.
However, whether NIF is built will probably depend more on
weapons-related reasons and budget concerns than its
potential energy benefits.

In summary, while alternate concepts provide no panacea for
fusion energy, there is merit in examining them as part of a
broad fusion program.  However, as with the tokamak effort,
the overall direction of the fusion energy program and its
role in meeting long-term energy needs, are critical issues
for the direction of alternate concepts research.

OVERALL DIRECTION

Decisions for TPX and alternate concepts research must be
made in the context of three critical questions facing the
fusion energy program.  First, what is the potential role of
the fusion energy program in meeting long-term energy needs,
and what level of research effort is justified by that role?
Many energy technologies ranging from nuclear fission
reactors, to photovoltaics, to fossil energy production
methods, to more energy-efficient devices will continue
improving over the next several decades.  These present an
increasingly challenging market environment for future
fusion powerplants, and need to be carefully considered in
setting the direction of fusion energy research.

A second critical question for the program results from the
tremendous budget pressures facing the federal government.
What goals for the fusion energy program could be
accomplished under scenarios of flat or declining budgets?
The current program goals and directions, including
construction and operation of large new tokamaks, are
inconsistent even with moderately increasing budgets; the
possibility of declining budgets sharpens the issue.
Potentially valuable work can be performed under a wide
range of research budgets, but doing so most productively
would require extensive change in program direction.

Third, can cost-sharing through international collaboration
in fusion energy research be more effectively pursued? Due
to the very high estimated cost of some fusion facilities
such as ITER, the domestic fusion energy program is pursuing
a few collaborative efforts with several countries.  Methods
to more fully coordinate and integrate other aspects of the
U.S. program into a broader world effort could be important
considerations in any next steps for the U.S. fusion energy
program.

HARMFUL NON-INDIGENOUS SPECIES IN THE UNITED STATES--REPORT

***********************************************************
Harmful non-indigenous species (NIS)--those plants, animals,
and microbes that are found beyond their natural
geographical range--annually cost the Nation millions to
billions of dollars and cause significant and growing
environmental problems, says a new report from the Office of
Technology Assessment, Harmful Non-Indigenous Species in the
United States.  At the same time, beneficial NIS form the
backbone of American agriculture and are important in
horticulture, fish and wildlife management, biological
control, and the pet industry.  OTA's work takes a
comprehensive look at the damaging species.

******************
*  WHAT'S WHERE  *
******************

The movement of plants, animals, and microbes is much like
biological roulette.  Once in a new environment,  an
organism may die.  Or it may take hold and reproduce with
little noticeable effect.  But sometimes a new species
spreads, with devastating results.

Almost every part of the country faces at least one highly
damaging NIS--like the zebra mussel, gypsy moth, or leafy
spurge (a weed).  They affect many national interests:
agriculture, industry, the protection of natural areas, and
human health.  The melaleuca tree, for example, is rapidly
degrading the Florida Everglades system by replacing
sawgrass marshes, forests, and other natural habitats with
single species stands.  In Hawaii, NIS are responsible for
extinctions and replacements of indigenous species; they now
make up at least one-half of the State's wild plants and
animals.

Naturally occurring movements of species into the United
States are rare.  Most organisms arrive with human help.
Numerous NIS entered the country as unintended contaminants
of commodities, packing materials, shipping containers, or
ships' ballast.  Others were intentionally imported as
crops, ornamental plants, livestock, pets, or aquaculture
species--and later escaped.  For example, at least 36 of the
West's 300 weeds escaped from horticulture or agriculture.
A number of NIS were imported to improve soil conservation,
fishing and hunting, or biological control but caused
unexpected harm.

*****************************************
*  THE GOOD, THE BAD, THE "WHO KNOWS?"  *
*****************************************

Some NIS (like soybeans and most pets) are clearly
beneficial; some (like gypsy moths, Russian wheat aphids,
and crabgrass) are clearly harmful.  Some are both,
depending on location.  And value is in the eye of the
beholder.  Purple loosestrife, for example, is an attractive
garden plant and a major wetland weed.

At least 4,500 NIS of foreign origin have established free-
living populations in the United States, a much larger
number than were present 100 years ago.  Approximately 15%
of the total species trigger severe harm.  Most species'
economic impact is not recorded.  However, from 1906-1991,
just 79 NIS caused documented losses of $97 billion, mostly
in control costs and losses of marketable goods.  A worst
case scenario for 15 potentially high-impact NIS adds
another $134 billion in future economic losses.  This figure
likely represents only a fraction of the total costs because
many species and kinds of effects are uncounted.  Harmful
NIS also have exacted a significant toll on U.S.  natural
areas, ranging from wholesale changes in ecosystems to more
subtle ecological alterations.

The rate of harmful introductions fluctuates in response to
social, political, and technological factors.  This rate
does not appear to be increasing, although it is far higher
than the natural rate of introductions.  The cumulative
number of foreign NIS in the United States, however, is
climbing steadily and swiftly--creating an ever greater
economic and environmental burden.  Just since 1980, over
200 foreign species were first introduced or detected and at
least 59 of these are expected to be harmful.Uncertainty in predicting types and levels of risk remains a
problem.  Past intentional and accidental fish and wildlife
introductions, for instance, have had about equal chances of
turning out badly.  Uncertainty can be reduced, or at least
be made explicit, using methods such as risk analysis,
benefit/cost analysis, environmental impact assessment, and
decisionmaking protocols.  The central issues for NIS and
genetically engineered organisms, a special subset of this
group, are the same: how to match an organism's potential
for harm to pre-release scrutiny, how to treat high-risk
species, and how to anticipate effects in new environments.

*****************************
*  AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION?  *
*****************************

For some species, prevention is the best strategy.  However,
port inspection and quarantine are fallible, with
diminishing returns above a certain point.  Also, some
organisms are more easily controlled than intercepted.  So
aiming for a standard of "zero entry" is unrealistic,
especially if prevention comes at the expense of control.
When prevention fails, rapid response is essential.  So far,
such quick action has prevented establishment of the Asian
gypsy moth, a major threat to Pacific Northwest forests.
Managing non-indigenous pests presents hard choices because
funds, technology, and other resources are often limited.
Sometimes this means not controlling already widespread
organisms, or those for which control is very expensive, or
those having lower impacts.

Chemical pesticides play the largest role now in containing,
suppressing, or eradicating NIS and they will remain
important.  An increased number of biologically based
technologies can be predicted.  Genetic engineering will
increase the efficacy of some.  Those who develop biological
and chemical pesticides face the same difficulties--ensuring
species specificity, slowing the development of pest
resistance, preventing harm to non-target organisms,
clearing regulatory hurdles, and providing profits for
manufacturers.

***************************
*  A PATCHWORK OF POLICY  *
***************************

The Federal Government has responded to harmful NIS with a
largely uncoordinated patchwork of laws, regulations,
policies and programs.  Many only peripherally address NIS,
while others address the more narrowly drawn problems of the
past.  At least 20 Federal agencies are involved, with the
U.S.  Departments of Agriculture and Interior playing the
largest roles.  Federal laws leave both obvious and subtle
gaps that most States do not fill adequately.  Significant
gaps exist for fish, wildlife, animal diseases, weeds,
species in non-agricultural areas, and vectors of human
diseases.  Many of these gaps also apply to genetically
engineered organisms because they are commonly regulated
under the same laws.

Federal agencies manage about 30% of the Nation's lands,
many with grim NIS problems.  Yet management policies are
often inconsistent or inadequate.  Even the National Park
Service, with fairly strict rules, finds invasions
threatening the very characteristics for which some parks
were founded.

Federal and State agencies cooperate on many programs
related to agricultural pests, but their policies can also
conflict, e.g., when agencies manage adjacent lands.
Sometimes Federal law preempts State law, more often
regarding agriculture than fish and wildlife.  Conflicts
between States also occur, often without forums for
resolving disputes.

State laws are relatively complete for agricultural pests
but spotty for invertebrate and plant pests of
nonagricultural areas.  The State role is most critical for
the import and release of fish and wildlife.  These laws use
a variety of approaches and vary from lax to exacting.
While many fish and wildlife laws are weak and inadequately
implemented, others present exemplary approaches.  Harmful
NIS have hit Hawaii and Florida particularly hard  because
of their distinctive geography, climate, history, and
economy.  Cooperative efforts have sprung up in both places.
Increasingly, State and Federal agencies, nongovernmental
organizations, agricultural interests, and universities see
harmful NIS as a unifying threat and public education as an
important tool to alleviate it.

***************************
*  CONGRESSIONAL CHOICES  *
***************************

Congress can select many ways to better protect U.S.
resources.  Specific actions might include amendments to the
Lacey Act and the Federal Noxious Weed Act.  Congress might
require stricter screening for invasiveness for federally
funded efforts using NIS.  Congress could direct more funds
to weed management on public lands and to resource
management in the national parks.  Congress could expand
environmental education and provide Federal agencies with
adequate authority for emergencies.

Imposing new responsibilities without providing money for
them does not work.  Entrance or user fees could fund more
rigorous and scientific decisionmaking and additional
control.  Fines, levied on those who bring harmful NIS into
the country or spread them to new States, could more closely
match the real costs of publicly funded management.  Federal
policy cannot succeed without State help.  Model State laws
or national minimum standards could ensure that all States
have authority to regulate harmful NIS adequately.

NIS are here to stay and many of them are welcome.  Problems
due to harmful ones are likely to worsen, however.  Human
migration and population growth, increasing trade and
travel, and, possibly, climate change propel species'
movements.  Countervailing trends--toward stricter screening
and more sophisticated control--are weaker.  We can envision
a future in which harmful NIS are so widespread that
economic costs snowball and one place looks much like
another.  Or we can imagine a future in which beneficial NIS
contribute much to human well-being, harmful ones are
effectively limited, and indigenous species are preserved.
Choosing this vision, rather than another, is ultimately a
cultural and political choice--a choice about the kind of
world we value and in which we want to live.

OTA REPORT SUMMARY
IDENTIFYING HEALTH TECHNOLOGIES THAT WORK: SEARCHING
FOR EVIDENCE
*

Most of the technologies used in everyday health care
have never been rigorously tested to determine exactly
how well they work, or whether they work better than
alternatives.  But maintaining this level of ignorance
has become a luxury.

Many of today's health reform proposals rely on
research into the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness
of medical technologies, along with clinical practice
guidelines backed by this research, to support the
changes they envision.  These proposals include
strategies such as:

o  linking insurance benefits to the effectiveness and
cost-effectiveness of particular technologies and
services;

o  increasing the use of managed-care providers, who
often look to information on cost-effectiveness and
clinical practice guidelines to establish efficient
internal management strategies; and

o  using "report cards" to judge and compare health
care providers and plans, a strategy that uses
published indicators intended to represent how well
those providers adhere to practices known to be
effective.

Underlying all of these strategies is the expectation
that the ongoing federal investment in research to
evaluate health care technologies, as carried out
through the activities of a number of different
government agencies, can accurately identify what works
best.

*
IDENTIFYING EFFECTIVE HEALTH TECHNOLOGIES
*

Conceptually, "effectiveness research" encompasses
research efforts aimed at identifying broadly effective
care--care that is effective not just under ideal and
highly controlled test conditions but under ordinary
circumstance, when applied to ordinary patients in
everyday practice.

In Identifying Health Technologies That Work: Searching
for Evidence, the Office of Technology Assessment (OTA)
found that the hopes for effectiveness research are not
misplaced, but they have been overly optimistic and
often misdirected.  Successfully implementing the
findings of valid effectiveness research will probably
improve the quality of health care.  It will not
necessarily reduce health care costs significantly.
Effectiveness research will be a good "buy" if it can
improve health care while paying for its own research-
related costs through targeted health system cost
reductions.

The focal point of federal effectiveness research is
the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR),
which was created by Congress in 1989 specifically to
further the evaluation of current clinical practice.
And at the forefront of AHCPR's research are its
Patient Outcomes Research Teams (PORTs), each of which
focuses on identifying the most effective management
for a particular health condition.

Contributions of the federal effectiveness research
effort thus far include:

o  creating a fertile environment for research on
existing technologies, by describing the outcomes of
current health practices and highlighting the
variations and uncertainties in their use;

o  emphasizing the measurement on outcomes that matter
to patients (e.g., physical functioning) rather than
intermediate measures (e.g., lab test scores), and
furthering the development of these measurement tools;
and

o  developing and demonstrating important research
tools, particularly new research applications of large
administrative databases and meta-analysis and other
systematic reviews of the literature.

Thus far, however, the federal effort has been largely
unsuccessful at its initial charge: evaluating the
comparative effectiveness of alternative treatments.
The analysis of large databases, a technique that has
been emphasized in past PORT research, has proved not
to be a particularly useful tool in providing valid,
believable answers about comparative effectiveness.
Experimental study designs (e.g., variations on the
randomized controlled trial design) that could provide
more valid results have been underused.

*
NEEDS AND OPTIONS:
*

1.  Improve the efficient production of meta-analyses
and other systematic overviews of existing studies, to
make the best use of past efforts at clinical
evaluation.

o  Increase funding targeted to systematic reviews
(e.g., through specific grants, PORTs, or the U.S.
participants in the Cochrane Collaboration, an
international network of researchers and coordinating
centers).

o  Require investigators proposing new studies to
demonstrate, through references to meta-analyses or
other systematic reviews, that the research is not
unnecessarily redundant.

o  Encourage the National Library of Medicine to
maintain a commitment to establishing comprehensive
databases of published controlled clinical trials.

2.  Conduct more, and more efficient, clinical trials
that yield valid comparative information on existing
technologies, with results directly useful to patient
and clinician decisionmaking; and make valid, well-
designed comparative studies an intrinsic part of
ordinary practice in every setting.

o  Encourage collaboration among AHCPR and National
Institutes of Health (NIH) researchers, particularly
regarding the wider use of broad outcome measures   in
more NIH-sponsored clinical trials.

o  Establish and maintain a comprehensive database of
ongoing clinical trials sponsored by the federal
government (and, where possible, private industry).

o  Invest in a nationwide, community-based research
infrastructure that could be used for conducting large,
community-based clinical trials on topics of broad
interest to practitioners and patients.

3.  Encourage greater comparative evaluations of newly
introduced technologies.

o  Offer incentives to manufacturers to conduct
comparative studies.

o  Encourage or require payers, including government
insurers, to link health insurance coverage for new
technologies with structured, monitored evaluations of
those technologies.

o  Expand the government's role in sponsoring
comparative evaluations of new technologies.

*
USING INFORMATION ON COST-EFFECTIVENESS
*

Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) can improve
decisionmaking by structuring and making explicit the
full range of costs and health effects relevant to a
decision that involves choices between health
interventions. The production and use of CEAs are
increasing, particularly in the private sector, spurred
by cost-conscious managed-care administrators and other
prudent health care purchasers.

Several federal agencies occasionally sponsor CEAs and
research into underlying techniques. Given the
government's role as a purchaser and regulator of
health care and health products, however, the level of
federal activity in this area is surprisingly weak.

As CEA comes of age, and the results of CEA are
increasingly finding their way into health care
decisionmaking, this technique and its findings deserve
new scrutiny.  Purchasers and regulators of health care
and health care products--e.g., the health insurers and
the Food and Drug Administration--will need to become
educated users and reviewers of CEA claims.  Public
policymakers, too, have a vested interest in access to
high-quality, comparable CEAs as a tool for
decisionmaking.

OPTIONS:

o  Coordinate and underwrite efforts to improve the
comparability of CEAs being produced in both the public
and the private sectors.  Inconsistencies among
analyses in the approaches and assumptions they use
will confuse policymakers and hinder the practical use
of CEA.  U.S. and international efforts to address this
issue, through better standardization of at least some
aspects of CEA, deserve attention and support.

o  Increase sponsorship of policy-relevant CEAs and of
underlying methodological research, particularly
research that examines the different impact of
different methods on analytic results.

HEALTH TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT

The findings of effectiveness research and cost-
effectiveness analysis are crucial inputs to
assessments of the broader impact of health
technologies.  As defined in this report, health
technology assessment is a structured analysis of a
health care technology, a set of related technologies,
or a technology-related issue that is performed for the
purpose of providing input to a policy decision.

One of the most remarkable developments in the field of
health technology assessment has been the explosive
growth in the private market.  As the demand for
technology assessments by health care providers and
payers has grown, so too has the supply of both in-
house and independent producers of assessments.

AHCPR's Office of Health Technology Assessment (OHTA)
is the main source of assessments of individual
technologies for government health insurance programs.
In the face of the greatly expanded private-sector
capability for assessments, the future role for OHTA-
and other government-sponsored assessments could take
several possible paths.

OPTIONS:

o  Expand the breadth of OHTA assessments (e.g., to
more technologies) and the breadth of government
programs that can request OHTA assessments (e.g.,
Medicaid programs) but continue to perform assessments
primarily at the request of government decisionmakers.

o  Expand the government's intramural assessment
capabilities to accommodate the needs of private-sector
users.

o  Sponsor private technology assessments or assessment
centers.

Extending OHTA's responsibilities to include many
assessments for private- as well as public-sector users
has the potential advantages of efficiency and
consistency in assessments, particularly those used by
insurers for making coverage decisions.  Limiting
OHTA's responsibilities to requests from public-sector
users, on the other hand, has the advantages of being
less expensive and continuing to encourage the
production of multiple assessments that could be
compared, discussed, and targeted more specifically to
users' needs.

*
CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES
*

Many federal agencies sponsor and issue clinical
practice guidelines (see table).  These guidelines,
usually developed by expert advisory panels, are
another manifestation of the need to assess the impacts
of health technologies; they constitute decisions about
the best use of medical technologies that are
implicitly supported by the federal government.

The various guideline development efforts operate
entirely independently, and different agencies
sometimes issue conflicting guidelines on the same
topic.  The methods they use to develop the various
guidelines also differ tremendously.

There is some evidence to suggest that linking
guideline recommendations to good evidence improves the
validity of guidelines and the likelihood that panels
of experts will agree on the recommendations.  The
composition of the panel and the discussion and
decision process it uses become increasingly important
determinants of the recommendations as evidence
declines.

In general, however, the implications of using
different methods to produce guidelines are very poorly
understood.

OPTIONS:

o  Develop better methods and clearer rationales for
prioritizing guideline topics.

o  Document and test alternative methods and models for
guideline development--e.g., whether formally
considering cost and cost-effectiveness when developing
the guidelines affects the recommendations, the impact
of those recommendations on clinical practice, and the
overall effects for patients and payers.

o  Strengthen federal investment in the development of
tools that can be used by guidelines panels, public and
private alike (e.g., methods to identify and assess the
causes of variations in practice for use in
prioritizing guideline topics).

o  Coordinate guidelines efforts across agencies.

CHANGING CLINICAL PRACTICE

In the federal medical effectiveness initiative,
clinical practice guidelines were envisioned as the
final step in translating research results into changes
in practice.  Passive dissemination of guidelines to
clinicians, however, often has no effect.  Raising the
likelihood of change requires more active strategies.
In general, multi-pronged, intensive, targeted
strategies are most likely to have an impact, but they
are neither cheap nor easy.

Financial and administrative mechanisms can be powerful
agents of change but, unless the guidelines they
promote are extremely compelling or issued by
organizations credible to clinicians, they may have
unintended effects as clinicians try to circumvent
them.

Strategies that rely more on education and voluntary
change--e.g., the use of "opinion leaders" to promote a
particular guideline's recommendations--can also be
effective, under certain conditions. Clinicians are
most likely to find  credible those clinical practice
guidelines in whose development they have participated,
and those produced by organizations with which they are
affiliated.

On the other hand, guidelines developed by heavy users
of a procedure--e.g., clinical specialists--are more
likely to promote use of the procedure than guidelines
produced by persons representing a broader range of
perspectives.  Thus, guidelines that more accurately
represent broader values may be less likely to lead to
voluntary changes in clinical practice.

Practice profiling--comparing patient outcomes or
procedure rates across providers--is increasingly used
as a tool to promote practice change.  To lead to
better (as opposed to merely different) care, however,
profiling must be based on good information about the
most effective practices--i.e., valid effectiveness
research.

*
DIRECTING AND COORDINATING THE FEDERAL EFFORT
*

AHCPR does not currently have the mandate, the
commitment, the resources, or the leverage either to
fill the gaps entirely itself or to successfully
coordinate the effectiveness research and clinical
practice guideline efforts of other agencies. Filling
the gaps in the overall federal effort to identify
health technologies that work will require greater
coordination among agencies.  It will also require
changes in the perceived responsibilities of agencies,
particularly AHCPR and NIH, along with either new
resources or shifts in the priorities and purposes to
which existing resources are committed.

OPTIONS:

o  Designate a single lead agency to perform
effectiveness research activities and coordinate
guideline activities.  Alternative strategies for
achieving this centralization would be to fold AHCPR
into a new, larger agency with a broader mandate and
more resources; or to change AHCPR's mandate (or the
mandate of another agency) to designate that agency as
the lead agency for coordinating guideline efforts, for
conducting comparative effectiveness trials, and for
filling some of the other most pressing needs.

o  Do not establish a single lead agency, but clarify
the roles of existing agencies in effectiveness
research and encourage or require collaboration among
agencies through administrative mechanisms.  For
example, a possible mechanism for collaboration might
be to require NIH institutes to give high priority to
funding research studies on topics identified by
guideline panels, PORT findings, or advisory bodies at
AHCPR.

Designating a single, larger agency as the focal point
to fill the gaps in effectiveness research and related
activities would eliminate the need for cumbersome,
time-consuming, and haphazard coordination across
agencies.  However, this strategy also has substantial
disadvantages, including the disruption of creating (or
re-creating) another new agency, and the difficulty any
single agency will have in being able to encompass all
relevant activities.  The agency would also need to
find funding to expand these activities; without
substantial additional resources, any new agency will
be unable to improve significantly on the current
commitments of AHCPR.

Clarifying and respecifying the roles of existing
agencies to fill the gaps in effectiveness research is
a much less expensive and, in some ways, a simpler
strategy.  Implementing this option, however, would
require a shift in funding between or within agencies
toward studies performing comparative research on
existing practices and technologies, rather than toward
development of new technologies or descriptive studies.
The organizational and institutional barriers to
shifting either resources or research priorities are
themselves substantial and would probably require a
legislative directive to overcome.

CHALLENGES AND BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES--REPORT BRIEF

***********************************************************
Environmental problems are capturing worldwide attention at
a time of intensifying global economic competition. As a
result, according to a recently released report from the
Office  of Technology Assessment, Industry, Technology, and
the Environment: Competitive Challenges and Business
Opportunities, society faces the need to understand and
address links between environmental policies and those of
trade, technology, and competitiveness. Technology and
policies that promote technological innovation and
efficiency are key to resolving many pressing environmental
problems, to boosting the long-term export potential of U.S.
environmental firms, and to making it less costly for firms
to comply with environmental regulations.

Industry is increasingly affected by changing competitive
realities shaped by the environmental expectations of their
customers and the societies in which they operate. This
study focuses on competitive challenges and opportunities
for two kinds of American industries that are affected by
environmental regulation: 1) environmental technology and
service firms; and 2) manufacturing firms in general that
are responding to requirements for reduced pollution.

In the first case, U.S. environmental firms may be able to
benefit from unprecedented opportunities to expand into new
markets likely to develop in the years ahead as more
countries establish or tighten environmental standards. U.S.
firms currently are competitive in most environmental
sectors but face intensifying competition from firms in
Europe, Japan, and some newly industrialized countries. Some
predict huge worldwide markets for environmental
technologies and services--perhaps exceeding $300 billion
per year by the end of the decade. Most of this demand will
be filled locally. However, trade is still sizable, and
prospects for increasing U.S. exports are probably greatest
for relatively sophisticated equipment and services. While
the growth in U.S. jobs related to such an increase may be
modest, many of these jobs will be high-wage technical or
engineering jobs.

As for U.S. manufacturing firms, the environmental
regulations that benefit society as a whole represent a
competitive challenge. While pollution control is not a top-
ranking factor affecting competitiveness, it does add to
manufacturing costs. U.S. manufacturers have faced stiff
competition from able foreign competitors in the last
decade, and differences in pollution control compliance
costs between the U.S. and other nations have the potential
to affect relative competitive positions. Compliance costs
incurred by U.S. manufacturers for pollution control are
among the highest in the world, apparently exceeding those
in Japan and many European nations. Moreover, some countries
provide their companies with greater financial and technical
help in complying with pollution abatement requirements.

A major economic and environmental opportunity for the
future will be to integrate environmental concerns into the
next generation of manufacturing technologies. Cleaner, more
cost-effective production technologies could help U.S.
manufacturers reduce compliance costs while still meeting
U.S. environmental standards, which are likely to remain
among the toughest in the world. Such technologies also
could be a key to maintaining a highly competitive
environmental industry with the strong export potential
needed to generate jobs for U.S. workers.

Cleaner production technologies also are critical for
progress toward the goal of sustainable development--an
overriding global need for the long term. More cost
effective than conventional controls alone, they have the
potential to ease conflicts between economic and
environmental goals.

Debate is under way about the U.S. Government's role both in
promoting development and trade in environmental technology
and in helping U.S. firms meet environmental standards more
cost effectively. Government regulations both create markets
for environmental technologies and the compliance conditions
faced by industry. The report discusses experiments with new
forms of regulation (including economic incentives) that
might make it easier or cheaper for manufacturers to meet
environmental requirements. Another issue is how to ensure
that the Federal Government's sizable research and
development budget for environmentally  preferable
technologies produces commercial, as well as environmental,
benefits for U.S. society. Other policy areas, including
manufacturing research and development, industrial
extension, and export promotion, also could affect
development, diffusion, and trade in environmental
technologies.

This report examines the pros and cons of more than 30
policy options that Congress may wish to consider. Among
them:

	o  devise a strategy to promote development and
widespread domestic diffusion of environmentally preferable
technologies;

	o  create mechanisms to integrate environmental
objectives into government support for manufacturing
industry R&D;

	o  develop regulatory approaches that allow firms that
are first rate environmental performers more choice in how
they meet environmental requirements;

	o  use export promotion and development assistance
programs to encourage export of environmentally and
developmentally sound U.S. technologies; and

	o  work toward bilateral or multilateral agreements
that help other nations achieve environmental goals, lessen
the likelihood of adverse competitive impacts for U.S. firms
and workers, and expand opportunities for U.S. environmental
firms abroad.

The American public wants better services from government at
less cost. This is a tough order at a time when demand is
growing and budgets are tighter. The administration's
"National Performance Review (NPR)" and "National
Information Infrastructure (NII)" initiatives place high
hopes on information technology to help improve the overall
performance of the Federal Government. OTA's Making
Government Work: Electronic Delivery of Federal Services
concludes that computer and telecommunications technologies
will play an important role, but emphasizes that
improvements in service delivery are by no means assured.

Will information technology make it easier for all
Americans--rural and urban, young and old, affluent and
impoverished--to obtain the government services to which
they are entitled? Or will electronic delivery further
widen--rather than narrow--the gap between the information
technology "haves" and "have-nots" and simply increase the
advantages that educated, technically proficient citizens
have over those less so? Many of the potential social
benefits of electronic delivery will be lost if information
technology is not widely accessible, usable, and affordable.

Will electronic delivery simplify the provision of
government services and improve cooperation among Federal
agencies and their State and local government counterparts,
resulting in less costly and more effective delivery? Or
will electronic delivery add yet another complication to the
already confusing, cumbersome manner in which governments
organize and deliver many services?  Many of the potential
economic benefits of electronic delivery will be lost if the
Federal Government fails to capitalize on opportunities for
innovation or does not develop economies of scale and scope
through partnerships among Federal, State, and local
agencies and the private sector.

These challenges are immense. The administration's NPR and
NII initiatives provide important vision and general
direction, but neither offers detailed policy guidance and
actions that are needed to speed the transition toward cost-
effective and equitable electronic delivery.

****************************
*  A STRATEGY FOR SUCCESS  *
****************************

OTA identifies seven key strategic elements of successful
electronic delivery. These would, if implemented, constitute
the backbone of a governmentwide electronic service delivery
initiative and a shift towards a creative, accessible,
citizen- or client-centered approach to service delivery.
These elements include:

	o  involving local citizens and recipients of Federal
services at the grassroots level;

	o  developing the community infrastructure of schools,
libraries, community centers, and other local agencies that
can facilitate electronic delivery through training,
education, and implementation;

	o  encouraging innovation by Federal agency employees,
clients, and others in trying new ways of delivering
services electronically;

	o  creating directories to agency services (including
information services and information about other services);

	o  creating alternative futures for electronic delivery
by generating new ideas for the use of information
technology and matching electronic opportunities with agency
missions;

	o  strategic partnering between Federal and State/local
government agencies; voluntary, not-for-profit, or
philanthropic organizations; and commercial companies
engaged or interested in electronic delivery; and

	o  pre-operational testing of electronic delivery
systems on a regional or national scale prior to full
deployment, including explicit early attention to
performance evaluation and policy development.

Congress could: a) require that these strategic elements be
included in Federal agency plans and budgets for electronic
delivery; b) reinforce their importance when reauthorizing
the Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) and through annual
appropriations; and c) work with, and monitor, the Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) to develop detailed guidance for
delivery of government services. A possible set of
directives (table 1) includes specific budget set-asides (a
proportion of each agency's information technology budgets)
for grassroots involvement, community infrastructure
development, innovation, and pre-operational evaluation--
activities that otherwise are likely to be underfunded.

*********************************
*  OTHER CONGRESSIONAL ACTIONS  *
*********************************

Citizens need to know what services exist and how to obtain
them. They also must be able to access the electronic
systems needed to receive the services. Congress could
direct the executive branch to develop directories or
"electronic road maps" to help citizens identify and locate
needed services and direct OMB to review agency activities
to assure access for citizens who might otherwise fall
through the cracks of electronic delivery.

The management structure for Federal information technology
applications is outdated and needs to be redesigned, as some
States have begun to do. This will be a difficult process.
Significant change is needed to jump-start the Federal
Information Resources Management (IRM) bureaucracy in
directions that emphasize service to the citizen and
electronic delivery. Congress could use amendments to the
PRA, or equivalent legislation, to provide a clear sense of
legislative intent. (See table 2.)

The telecommunications infrastructure is an essential part
of electronic delivery. (See figure 1.)  The Federal
Government has not linked electronic service delivery needs
and opportunities with the capabilities offered by private
sector vendors. For electronic delivery to reach its
potential, citizens need easily available and affordable
access to advancing telecommunications and computer
networking. Congress must play an active role to achieve
this.

Federal information policies are becoming more and more
outdated as the trend toward electronic delivery
accelerates. This requires that statutes on privacy,
security, records management and archiving, procurement,
open government, and freedom of information be updated.

Congress also can use electronic delivery for its own
purposes: videoconferencing for committee hearings;
electronic bulletin boards for hearing schedules and
legislative materials; and computer conferences for public
input and dialogue. Delivering services electronically could
further open Congress to the people, strengthen the role of
Congress as the people's branch of government, and, in the
process, set an example for the executive branch and the
Nation.

***********************************************************
                OTA REPORT SUMMARY

    MULTINATIONALS AND THE U.S. TECHNOLOGY BASE
***********************************************************

Multinational enterprises (MNEs) are business organizations
that underpin much of the U.S. economy and the international
system of trade and investment.  They are increasingly
global in their origins, sourcing, communications,
production, and outlook.  The foreign affiliates of MNEs
control a substantial portion of the world economy, perhaps
as much as one-quarter of all economic activity in their
host countries.  Intrafirm trade (IFT) may account for as
much as 40 percent of all U.S. merchandise trade.1

Even though MNEs exert an increasingly profound influence on
technology development in the United States, the U.S.
government currently does not have the institutions or the
capability to monitor and analyze foreign direct investment
(FDI) on a global basis, or to evaluate fully the
investments by foreign-based companies in the United States.
Clearly, a comprehensive understanding of the operations of
MNEs is necessary to facilitate their benefits to the U.S.
technology base, as well as to inform future U.S. economic
policies, both foreign and domestic.

At the level of the firm, successful companies know that
product design must follow consumer preference, and both
vary from market to market around the world.  These firms
recognize that local markets require a local presence, which
has led to wider distribution of the assets of many MNEs.
But local presence, even manufacturing, does not often
translate into local technology development, which has
remained--with a few important exceptions--stubbornly
resistant to the globalization phenomenon.

*
Finding 1:
*

*
Multinationals Develop Core Technology at Home
*

o  Unlike other principal activities of MNEs, research and
technology development tends to be concentrated in the
country of national origin. U.S.-based MNEs, for example,
conduct less than 13 percent of their manufacturing R&D
abroad. Although no comparable data exist for European and
Japanese MNEs, the available evidence suggests that they
conduct similar if not smaller percentages of their R&D
overseas than do U.S. firms.  R&D conducted by foreign
affiliates continues to increase, especially in such sectors
as chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and electronics; however, it
tends to be focused on product design and customization.

o  Foreign affiliates account for a small but rapidly rising
share of all business R&D spending in the United States.
That share increased from 9.4 percent ($4.5 billion) in 1982
to 16.4 percent ($10.7 billion) in 1992. Much of this
growth, however, resulted from unusually heavy foreign
acquisition of U.S. firms in the late 1980s.  Among our
major trading partners, Japanese affiliates in the United
States exhibit by far the lowest level of R&D intensity,
which is the ratio of R&D spending to sales (see figure 1).

o  In sharp contrast to other advanced industrial nations,
the United States typically exports four times more
technology than it imports.  Most of this trade is conducted
within MNEs. Japanese firms, however, acquire considerably
more technology from unaffiliated U.S. firms than do their
European counterparts.  In 1992, for example, 43 percent of
all U.S. technology sales to Japan were conducted between
unaffiliated firms, compared with 11 percent for Europe.2

o  Japanese firms spend more on technology development as a
percentage of GDP than do their U.S. or European
counterparts.  Between 1981 and 1993 industry-financed R&D
expenditures in Japan grew at an average rate of 8.0
percent.  The average growth rate for U.S. firms was 3.9
percent.  That number for the United Kingdom, Germany, and
France was 1.6, 3.9, and 4.6 percent respectively.

*
Finding 2:
*

*
Trade Follows Investment in the 1990s
*

o  Affiliates of foreign-based MNEs account for a
substantial portion of U.S. merchandise trade and the
greatest share of the U.S. merchandise trade deficit.  In
1991, for example, the trade deficit of foreign affiliates
in the United States was larger than the total U.S. trade
deficit (see figure 2).  Across the United States, Europe,
and Japan, affiliates of foreign-based MNEs have a greater
propensity to import than do domestic firms. In the absence
of foreign affiliates, however, it is possible that the U.S.
trade deficit would be even greater than it is.

o  Over the past decade, the U.S.-European direct investment
relationship has been relatively symmetrical in scale and
composition. Japanese investment in the United States,
however, exceeds U.S. investment in Japan by a factor of
three to one.  Moreover, it is far more concentrated in
wholesale operations (and less concentrated in
manufacturing) than is European or American FDI.  As global
FDI expanded dramatically in the 1980s and 1990s, U.S.
direct investment in Japan failed to keep pace with the
overall trend (see figure 3).

o  International trade among affiliated firms tends to
reflect the balance of investment between the United States
and its respective trading partners.  Between 1983 and 1992,
intrafirm trade (IFT) between the United States and Europe
was roughly equivalent, accounting for 43 percent of all
U.S.-European merchandise trade.  Of that IFT, 43 percent
was conducted by U.S.-based MNEs and 57 percent by European-
based MNEs (see figure 4).

o  Intrafirm trade between the United States and Japan is
far less balanced than U.S.-European IFT.  Over the past
decade, IFT accounted for 71 percent of all U.S.-Japan
merchandise trade.  Of that, fully 92 percent was conducted
by Japanese MNEs and only 8 percent by U.S.-based MNEs (see
figure 5).  These figures indicate that the majority of U.S.
trade with Japan takes place within and is dominated by
affiliated networks of Japanese firms.

*
Finding 3:
*

*
Corporate Governance and Finance Diverge Across the Triad
*

o  Despite the current blurring of national economic
boundaries, the competitive strength of individual MNEs
continues to be shaped by circumstances prevailing in their
home countries. Critically important distinctions persist in
the ways corporations govern themselves and raise long-term
capital across the United States, Germany, and Japan.

o  American capital markets are the largest, most
decentralized, open, and transparent in the world. Japanese
and German capital markets are changing somewhat, but they
are likely to remain relatively concentrated and opaque.

o  The ability to raise capital at competitive terms and to
deploy it effectively is crucial to both the long-term
success of particular MNEs and to the development of
critical technologies for individual nations. Long-term
capital remains more patient in Germany and Japan than in
the United States. Foreign firms enjoy full access to U.S.
capital markets; however, firms based outside Japan and
Germany are less able to benefit from the strengths inherent
in these capital markets.

o  Distinctive cross-shareholding and corporate banking
relationships shape the business strategies and development
trajectories of Japanese and many European MNEs.  These
institutional arrangements can provide stable foundations
for the commercial adaptation, incremental improvement, and
optimal diffusion of new technologies.

o  For the foreseeable future, it is likely that differences
in national systems of corporate governance and corporate
financing will be a source of increasing friction in the
complex economic relationships evolving among the United
States and several of its major trading and investing
partners.

*
Policy Issues
*

Taken together, the findings presented above suggest that
the United States has a clear interest in the success of
U.S.-based firms, both at home and abroad, in proportion to
the commitment that such firms make to the U.S. technology
base.  To the extent that foreign-based companies also
contribute to U.S. technology development, the United States
has a direct interest in their success as well.  More
technological innovation and development in the United
States can lead to more jobs for Americans.  Furthermore,
the higher-skill, higher-wage jobs of the future are likely
to reside in technology-intensive industries.

U.S. policy could pursue three basic strategic responses to
the international asymmetries in global trade, investment,
and finance identified by this assessment.  It could:

1.  Seek to expand existing multilateral trade agreements to
encompass obstacles to foreign direct investment,
restrictive business practices, and other barriers to
comparable market access.

2.  Create a two-tiered policy regime, one that grants
national treatment when comparable market access exists, and
another that places conditions on national treatment in
response to enduring formal or informal market barriers.

3.  Augment a broad multilateral strategy with domestic
measures designed to (a) improve U.S. technological
capabilities and (b) reform U.S. trade and investment
policies to meet the demands of increasingly global
commerce.

The specific policy options identified by this assessment
are divided into three broad areas:  technology development,
foreign direct investment, and the ways in which MNEs govern
and finance their operations.  They range, for example, from
creating a uniform national benefits test for participation
in U.S. technology policy programs to harmonizing national
financial regimes.  Policy issues and options are discussed
in detail in chapter 2 of the report.

<title>The National Space Transportation Policy</title>

OTA Report Summary

*
THE NATIONAL SPACE TRANSPORTATION POLICY;
ISSUES FOR CONGRESS
*

For nearly four decades, the United States has relied on its
national space transportation technology and industrial base
to support a multitude of national security, civil, and
commercial needs. This base has produced the rockets to
explore the planets and land the first man on the moon;
assured the nation's strategic nuclear deterrent; and
supplied policymakers with intelligence, geodesy, weather,
navigation, and other important information. It has
generated new technologies, supported new space-based
businesses, and helped the U.S. balance of trade.

Recent events and trends, however, are forcing this vital
industry to restructure. The end of the Cold War has reduced
the demand for defense and intelligence space launches and
halted new development of long-range ballistic missiles.
Federal budget deficit and debt concerns have put additional
pressure on government departments and agencies to be more
efficient and to reduce the cost of civil and national
security space launches. And policymakers have begun to
debate the proper balance between public and private
investment in space transportation.

In the commercial market, the aging U.S. domestic fleet of
expendable launch vehicles (ELVs) is facing stiff global
competition from the commercially focused European Ariane
rocket, as well as from Russian and Chinese ELVs that
benefit from hidden real costs and low-wage labor forces.
Meanwhile, entrepreneurs in the telecommunication,
navigation, and remote sensing satellite industries project
a moderate increase in demand for small and medium ELVs to
support their business ventures.

In response to these challenges, the Clinton Administration
released a new National Space Transportation Policy (NSTP)
on August 5, 1994. This policy established the President's
strategic vision for space transportation and directed the
Department of Defense (DOD), the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration (NASA), and the Departments of
Transportation and Commerce to prepare detailed
implementation plans supporting the new policy within 90
days.

OTA's report, The National Space Transportation Policy:
Issues for Congress, examines the new Clinton Administration
policy and supporting implementation plans and raises issues
that Congress may wish to consider as it debates the future
of U.S. space transportation.

DOD AND NASA DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AND PROCUREMENTS

The NSTP divides the government's primary responsibilities
for space transportation between DOD and NASA: DOD is in
charge of ELV development and NASA is in charge of Space
Shuttle operations and reusable launch vehicle (RLV)
development. This division will increase the need for both
organizations to coordinate with one another, as well as
with the private sector.

DOD and NASA have collectively proposed a sizable portfolio
of new space transportation development programs (see table
1). Although this multitrack approach may reduce the overall
risk of developing new space transportation systems, it may
also lead to conflicts and redundancies and higher overall
costs. For example, development of a commercially
competitive Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) by DOD
could undercut NASA's effort to commercialize a follow-on to
the X-33 by reducing the incentive for private investors to
fund a technically risky RLV.

DOD currently spends $1.6 billion of its $1.9 billion space
transportation budget on the heavy-lift Titan IV launch
vehicle. Therefore, DOD plans to focus cost reductions on
the heavy end of its EELV family of launch vehicles. This
focus, however, ignores the need of U.S. launch providers to
develop a commercially competitive launch vehicle in the
hotly contested medium ELV market. While the EELV program
may reduce medium-lift costs by as much as 10 percent, such
a cost reduction would probably not help the EELV
manufacturer recapture a significant portion of the global
market for launch services.

Moreover, if NASA develops a low-cost, medium-to-heavy RLV,
it may compete with some members of the EELV family for
payloads. If so, this would reduce or eliminate savings
generated by the EELV program.

Other potential conflicts and redundancies also exist. In
particular, NASA's Med-Lite vehicle might eventually compete
with the EELV for medium payloads, further reducing the
benefits of EELV launch vehicle consolidation. In addition,
NASA has proposed to phase in any newly developed RLV
follow-on to the X-33 between 2005 and 2012, while
continuing to fly the Space Shuttle in support of the
International Space Station.

At present, it appears that DOD and NASA will attempt to
resolve these conflicts through negotiations on a case-by-
case basis, possibly with some mediation by a third party
within the executive branch. Such negotiations may succeed
in keeping both DOD and NASA satisfied, but could fail to
account for the interests of all relevant parties,
especially those in the private sector.

USE OF FOREIGN LAUNCH VEHICLES AND COMPONENTS

The NSTP encourages federal agencies to take advantage of
foreign technologies in U.S. space transportation systems.
It also limits the flight of U.S. government payloads to
U.S. space transportation systems, in effect removing U.S.
government payloads from the available international
marketplace for launch services. In this, the NSTP follows
past policy. In addition, the policy allows the launch of
government payloads on foreign launch vehicles if they are
made available on a no-exchange-of-funds basis and if they
support cooperative scientific programs.

The use of foreign, especially Russian, technologies in U.S.
space transportation systems may improve the efficiencies of
U.S. launch systems, assist U.S. access to space, and
improve U.S. competitiveness in the international space
transportation market. With the important exception of the
Space Shuttle and its main engines, the United States has
done relatively little launch system research and
development since the 1960s.

On the other hand, U.S. national security interests demand
that the United States maintain a viable national space
transportation technology and industrial base. The use of
foreign technologies might reduce the incentives for
maintaining portions of the domestic base, making the United
States vulnerable to material disruption or cutoff.

Methods to protect component supply, such as stockpiling
critical components or duplicating production lines in the
United States, would likely result in higher costs to the
government, but might ensure that the United States would be
able to fulfill its space-related national security needs in
times of crisis.

Experts disagree over the extent to which cooperation with
the Russian government and industry on space projects would
affect U.S. competitiveness and the retention of U.S. jobs.
Some industry officials, for example, express concern that
the United States could lose jobs in the launch services
industry if U.S. launch systems used Russian technology
extensively. Others have argued that skillful incorporation
of Russian technologies in U.S. systems could save taxpayer
dollars in publicly funded programs like the International
Space Station and boost U.S. international competitiveness
in commercial programs. Greater competitiveness might
generate new jobs in space transportation and space-related
fields, partially or fully offsetting job losses resulting
from the use of foreign technology.

The simple purchase of either vehicles or launch services
appears to be less attractive than joint ventures, co-
production of vehicles and/or systems, and analogous
business arrangements, as ways of harmonizing these
differing interests. Cooperative ventures, however, risk
transferring domestic technologies that could be used to
strengthen a competitor's position in the international
aerospace market and to assist belligerent countries in
developing the means of delivering weapons of mass
destruction (nuclear, chemical, and biological weapons).
Experts disagree over how effective measures to prevent such
transfer can really be, but present policy clearly moves
toward loosening trade restrictions.

In keeping with broader U.S. international trade principles,
the NSTP seeks to achieve free and fair trade in launch
services. However, as a result of the close connections
between defense technologies and launch system technologies,
all spacefaring nations subsidize their launch services
industry to some extent. Because the economic structure of
each country is different, it is difficult to determine the
true extent of subsidy each extends to its launch industry.
In addition, each spacefaring country generally reserves
government payloads for its own launch systems.

During the late 1980s, the People's Republic of China and
Russia (then the Soviet Union) began to offer launch
services on the international market, increasing the
competitive pressure on U.S. commercial launch services.
Faced with growing competition in launch services,
increasing concern that launch systems built in non-market
economies would unfairly compete with U.S. launch systems,
and pressure from U.S. satellite manufacturers to allow the
launch of U.S.-built satellites on Chinese and Russian
launch systems, the United States sought and obtained launch
service agreements with China and Russia.

While these agreements protect U.S. launch providers from
unfair competition, they also raise the overall cost of
access to space. U.S. satellite manufacturers have begun to
lobby for a relaxation or elimination of existing
restrictions on the number of Russian commercial launches
allowed between now and the end of the century. They have
been joined by the U.S. partners of Russian launch
companies.

USE OF EXCESS BALLISTIC MISSILES

The Clinton Administration's policy continues the Bush
Administration's policy of tightly restricting the
conversion of surplus long-range ballistic missiles for use
as small ELVs. Some analysts argue that making these
missiles more widely available for use as space launch
systems would not only save much needed government
resources, but could also demonstrate the viability of new
markets for small ELVs. Others argue, however, that although
such a scheme might save the taxpayers money in the short
term, it would also flood the market and drive U.S.
commercial small ELV producers from the market.

Policymakers lack data on how much it would cost to convert
surplus ballistic missiles for new payloads, how useful
these missiles might be for more delicate payloads, and how
launch vehicle producers might maintain their ability to
develop new systems should ballistic missiles be priced
below current small ELVs. Those questions must be answered
before the debate on how to use excess ballistic missiles
can be resolved.

In contrast to American policy regarding surplus missile
assets, former Soviet enterprises are promoting a number of
converted long-range ballistic missiles for commercial use.
If these enterprises are successful in marketing surplus
ballistic missiles, U.S. launch service providers will face
international competition from former Soviet excess
ballistic missiles, whereas the U.S. government will receive
none of the benefits of selling its own stockpiles of
surplus missiles.

AN INCREASED PRIVATE-SECTOR ROLE

An added dimension to the current effort to develop new
space transportation systems is the enhanced role of the
private sector. The Clinton Administration expects the
private sector to play a crucial role in accomplishing many
national space transportation goals. The NSTP and the
supporting implementation plans, for example, depict private
firms as a source of 1) significant funding in a fiscally
constrained budget environment; 2) expertise to manage space
launch activities more efficiently; and 3) innovative ideas
and products in the design and development of future space
transportation systems.

Placing greater reliance on the private sector is in keeping
with general trends that emphasize reducing government's
responsibilities in areas in which the private sector might
reasonably be expected to provide the desired goods and
services.

Closer cooperation between government and industry raises
serious questions about who decides what research topics to
pursue, which efforts will be funded, who will own the
technical data rights resulting from this partnership, and
how these rights might be transferred if such transfer
appears to benefit the government.

The designated government advocates for increased commercial
participation are the Departments of Commerce and
Transportation, but with little money and small staffs,
these two Departments are likely to play a limited role.
NASA needs private sector investment to build a new, medium-
to-heavy RLV to replace the Space Shuttle, as well as a
smaller RLV for planetary probes. NASA has streamlined its
program management, changed funding rules, and made changes
in the use of its research staff in order to work better
with industry.

DOD, in contrast to NASA, does not have as critical a need
for a new space launch vehicle to perform its missions. Its
current capabilities are more costly and less flexible than
desired, but they still perform well enough to meet the
Department's fundamental mission requirements. DOD,
therefore, appears less concerned about developing a close
partnership with industry than is NASA, although it too is
adopting more commercial business practices.

Many in industry, however, continue to express concern that
new launch vehicles will be burdened with rigid government
space launch and payload requirements.

The willingness, and indeed, the ability of private sector
firms to fulfill the roles suggested in the national space
transportation planning documents depend in many instances
on factors that possess a great deal of uncertainty (e.g.,
the size and character of the future commercial space
transportation market) and that are highly dependent on
actions taken by the government.

In the absence of a major increase in the government's space
transportation budget, private sector investment is
essential for the development and production of a commercial
follow-on to the X-33 RLV possessing the characteristics
desired by NASA. But any private sector investment is
dependent on the potential for sufficient return on that
investment to make it attractive. The assessment of the
size, character, availability, and relationship (potential
overlap) of future space transportation markets is therefore
critical to industry's attitude toward new launch vehicle
development programs and government cost-sharing
arrangements.

Current analysis indicates that the government is likely to
continue to be the largest single market for U.S. space
transportation for at least the next 10 to 15 years.
Expansion of the existing commercial market in such things
as communications and Earth observation is probable, but the
size and rapidity of such expansion are uncertain. A number
of potential new markets such as space manufacturing and
tourism may be on the horizon, but the size and speed of
development of these markets are also uncertain.

With estimates on the cost of development and production of
a future X-33 follow-on RLV ranging from $6 billion to $20
billion, many in industry argue that government guarantees,
such as anchor tenancy and termination liability, are
essential for reducing the overall risk to the private
sector. Skeptics counter that such arrangements could amount
to providing a "risk free" business environment.

PRESERVATION OF LONG-RANGE BALLISTIC MISSILE CAPABILITIES

Neither the NSTP nor the implementation plans address the
preservation of long-range ballistic missile capabilities.
The U.S. Navy plans to procure the last long-range ballistic
missile in the strategic nuclear arsenal in 2005. Currently,
there are no plans to produce any additional missiles after
that time. Without producing missiles, however, the United
States' ability and capacity to design and produce long-
range ballistic missiles will deteriorate unless significant
efforts are made to preserve them.

Both the U.S. Air Force and the Navy have preservation
programs underway, but they are limited to a small set of
critical components. Solid rocket motor technology may be
particularly threatened. At present, all U.S. long-range
ballistic missiles use solid rocket motors. If both the EELV
and RLV designs use only liquid-fueled engines, and if
liquid-fueled boosters replace the Space Shuttle's solid
rocket motors, the market for large solid rocket motors in
the United States may disappear.

THE INVISIBLE LOWER INDUSTRIAL TIERS

The NSTP also largely ignores the lower tiers of the space
transportation industrial base. Firms in these tiers provide
most of the subsystems, components, and materials that the
prime contractors integrate into new launch vehicles. OTA
estimates that roughly fifty cents of every procurement
dollar for space launch services flow down to these lower-
tier firms.

An OTA workshop found that may of these firms are
pessimistic about their chances of survival.(1)  They are
not convinced that the government is committed to the actual
completion of new launch vehicles, and worry that research
and development money will not find its way past the prime
contractors.

If all the companies that produce a particular component or
material critical to the space transportation industry go
out of business because of either a lack of funds from the
upper-tier firms or foreign competition, it could be very
difficult and expensive to regain the capability to produce
that component again.

CRITICAL DECISION POINTS

Each of the space transportation policy implementation plans
was accompanied by an idealized timeline. While each agency
was careful to say that their timelines were not set in
stone, these timelines do provide policymakers with some
sense of important impending decisions and also some of the
hidden problems they may face in a few years. Table 2 lists
some of the more critical decision points and their
potential implications. Changes in political leadership, new
space program goals, stretched out or terminated programs,
unforeseen technical difficulties, and launch failures are
just a few of the events that could dramatically alter the
timing of these important decisions.

1 A background report on this workshop is forthcoming,
summer 1995.  A complete assessment of the space
transportation technology and industrial base is schedules
to be published in spring 1996.

PREPARING FOR AN UNCERTAIN CLIMATE--VOL. 1--REPORT BRIEF

***********************************************************
Concern about climate change has become so great that 166
countries recently agreed to take steps to reduce production
of the greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming.
Despite these efforts, some climate change is likely to
occur, although there is considerable uncertainty about
where, when, or how much.

Uncertainty is often cited as the reason for not preparing
for climate change. OTA concludes that uncertainty is in
fact why we must prepare. Delay may leave the Nation poorly
prepared to deal with changes that do occur and may increase
the possibility of irreversible impacts and costly
surprises.

The OTA report Preparing for an Uncertain Climate examines
the ability of natural-resource-based systems--specifically,
coastal areas, water resources, agriculture, wetlands,
preserved lands, and forests--to adapt to climate change and
considers means by which adaptation can be enhanced by
public policy.

Predicted climate changes include increased temperatures,
rising sea levels, changing patterns of precipitation, and
increased evaporation. Combined, these factors could
significantly alter the Nation's natural resources. Sea
level rise could increase the erosion of shorelines and
accelerate the loss of coastal wetlands. Changes in
precipitation could lead to more floods or droughts and to
disruption of water supplies. In regions that become drier,
interior wetlands could be lost. The ideal ranges for plants
and animals might shift hundreds of miles to the north as
temperatures increase, leading to losses of unique
assemblages of plants and animals in nature preserves.
Shifts in the range of agricultural crops and commercial
tree species could lead to disruptions in rural communities.
More frequent fire and die-back may occur on   forests
stranded outside their ideal climate range.

Depending on the resource, adaptation is currently
constrained by limited information, lack of available
technology, or institutional barriers. OTA considers more
than 100 options in the report that could overcome these
problems and assist adaptation. Many of these options would
simultaneously help deal with the problems that already face
our natural resource systems, including normal climate
variability, growing populations, and the ongoing
fragmentation of natural habitat. Policy options can be
organized under four categories of problems that are faced
by several or all of the resource systems (see box):

	1.  fragmentation--both institutional and geographical,

	2.  inadequate communication of information to improve
response to climatic risks,

	3.  lack of contingency planning to prepare for extreme
events or weather surprises, and

	4.  information gaps in various key scientific and
policy areas.

All four problem areas have been recognized to varying
degrees in the past, but progress toward addressing them
successfully has been slow. Far-reaching policy changes
could be required to eliminate these problems, but
collectively, many smaller, incremental actions by Congress,
the executive branch, and the private sector could also lead
to major improvements.

*******************
*  Coastal Areas  *
*******************

Sea level rise associated with climate change will probably
exacerbate flooding and erosion problems that already occur
along a significant proportion of U.S. coastlines. At the
same time, as coastal populations grow, the exposure of
people and property to these hazards--and to the risks posed
by extreme events, such as hurricanes--is steadily
increasing. Key impediments to climate change adaptation in
the coastal zone are institutional. Improvements are needed
in the National Flood Insurance Program, disaster-assistance
programs, coastal zone management, and public education.

*********************
*  Water Resources  *
*********************

In many parts of the country, water resources have long been
under stress, and growing competition among a wide variety
of  uses and users of water is exacerbating the situation.
Climate change is likely to cause some parts of the country
to become hotter and drier, thereby adding to their
problems. Solutions  to many water-quantity and -quality
problems are available and include greater use of
conservation, water marketing, basin-wide reservoir
management, and expanded use of modeling tools. Even so,
many institutional impediments--including the complex system
of water rights and lack of incentives to conserve--will
need to be assessed and adjusted to aid  adaptation to
climate change.

*****************
*  Agriculture  *
*****************

Market incentives and the annual planting cycles make
agricultural systems quite responsive to change. As long as
there are continued efforts in research and technology to
expand the base on which adaptation can proceed, coping with
climate change should be relatively easy for agriculture--
barring catastrophic changes. Yet, whether adaptation is
optimal may depend greatly on our ability to remove certain
institutional incentives that may encourage uneconomical
farming of areas where climatic risks are high. Farm
subsidies and disaster-assistance programs need review and
adjustment.

**************
*  Wetlands  *
**************

Degradation and destruction of wetlands is continuing
despite an ambitious "no-net-loss" policy. Lack of clear
statutory goals and fragmentation of authority governing
wetland protection have placed these systems at significant
risk. Sea level rise and changes in precipitation will
exacerbate ongoing losses. Efforts to reduce current wetland
loss, to restore degraded wetlands, and to acquire and
protect the most valuable wetland systems will lower the
risk to wetland habitat from future climate change. Federal
policies and programs should be reviewed and modified to
remove incentives that encourage wetland loss. Revising the
Clean Water Act during its current reauthorization provides
a target of opportunity to clarify statutory authority for
wetland protection.

*************
*  Forests  *
*************
A rapid warming might lead to severe decline of forest
species and ecosystems, with widespread losses from fires,
insects, or disease. Actions that would best guard against
these impacts include: increased monitoring of forest
health, preparation of contingency plans for dealing with
threats to forest health, development of an expanded program
of storage for forest seeds and genetic resources, and a
redirection of forestry incentive programs to encourage the
protection of ecologically valuable private forest lands
rather than to promote timber production.

***************
*  Preserves  *
***************

Climate change will shift the habitat range of plants and
animals, but the boundaries of national forests, parks,
reserves, and wildlife refuges are stationary. Species may
adapt to the new environment, migrate, or go extinct. As
preserves change, biodiversity, species protection, and
recreational opportunities could diminish. Limited
understanding of ecological processes will hinder efforts to
facilitate adaptation. The proposed National Biological
Survey could augment incomplete survey and monitoring data
of preserved areas. Research on maintaining, restoring, and
transplanting natural systems--research tasks that may
require decades of effort--is also needed. Strategic
acquisitions of land, purchase of land easements, and
innovative partnerships with adjacent landowners could
enhance adaptability to climate change.

************************************
*  Global ChangecResearch Program  *
************************************

The United States has put in place an ambitious Global
Change Research Program (USGCRP) to "observe, understand,
and, ultimately, predict global and regional climate
change."  However, this effort is overwhelmingly a physical
science program. As currently structured, it does not
address natural resource management, identify ecosystem-
level effects of climate change, or provide practical policy
guidance for mitigation or adaptation.

Policymakers must continue to reauthorize environmental and
other legislation, manage natural resources, develop energy
policy, and direct national science policy while scientists
continue to reduce uncertainties associated with climate
change. Establishing assessment mechanisms for integrating
research results, identifying and filling research gaps, and
translating research results into policy-relevant terms
would help to ensure that decisionmakers use the best
available information to chart policy paths.

U.S. CONGRESS
REPORT BRIEF

September 1994


PROLIFERATION AND THE FORMER SOVIET UNION

With the end of the Cold War, the direct threat that the
Soviet Union's nuclear and  other  weapons  of  mass
destruction posed to the United States was dramatically
reduced.  As the OTA report "Proliferation and the Former
Soviet Union" explains, however, the Soviet Union's breakup
introduced new potential dangers for the proliferation of
weapons of mass destruction.  In spite of the continuing
desire of most of the states that succeeded it to support
nonproliferation goals, these states face severe internal
challenges:  social and economic disruption are rampant and
the degree of central governmental control is often
questionable. Of particular concern are economic hardship
and low morale among many individuals with access to vital
weapon information or sensitive facilities--a situation that
is aggravated by as-yet inadequate national systems to
account for and secure nuclear materials, to control
exports, and to police borders.

The severity of the problems facing Russia and the other
newly independent states places limits on the ability of the
United States and other Western powers to help remedy
proliferation dangers. This study describes how U.S.
assistance may nevertheless reduce specific proliferation
risks. The consequences of failing to stem these risks
furnish a strong imperative for helping the newly
independent states address them.

FINDINGS

o  Over the last year, prospects have improved significantly
for the implementation of two major arms control agreements
by the four nuclear inheritor states of the former Soviet
Union (i.e., those states still having strategic nuclear
weapons on their territories): Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia,
and Ukraine. All these states have ratified START I and
three have ratified the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty
(NPT).  Although Ukraine has not yet ratified the NPT, it
has agreed to remove nuclear weapons from its territory,
eliminating a major stumbling block to NPT ratification. The
United States played an important part in  eliciting these
commitments from Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Ukraine.

o  All the nuclear inheritor states, however, are
experiencing difficulties in managing nuclear materials and
in controlling exports of equipment that could be used to
make nuclear weapons.  These states need to develop
expertise in nuclear safeguards and institute effective
export controls and customs services.

o  For both economic and technical reasons, external aid is
vital to bringing control over nuclear materials and
sensitive goods up to international standards in the
shortest possible time.  Consequently, delays in
implementing U.S. assistance mean delays in mitigating
proliferation risks. The problem is particularly serious if
these delays are not resolved before the authority to
obligate the funds expires.  For example, more than $200
million in assistance in fiscal year 1992 lapsed before the
funds could be allocated, and over $300 million in
additional funding is in danger of lapsing when this fiscal
year ends on September 30, 1994.  Delays in implementing
U.S. assistance have originated within the United States as
well as the former Soviet Union (FSU).  In the United States
they originate within Congress as well as the executive
branch.  These delays have dampened expectations among
scientists and political leaders in the FSU that significant
U.S. help will be forthcoming.

o  Aid that helps assure a minimal living standard for
custodians of nuclear materials, weapons, and weapon-related
expertise in the FSU will help prevent diversion or
misappropriation of sensitive goods and information. Much of
the morale problem among such individuals is due to low
salaries, delayed paychecks, and poor living conditions.
For this reason, spending some U.S. aid funds directly in
the FSU, rather than continuing the current practice of
spending nearly all of it on U.S. contractors, would be
productive.

o  Many Russian nuclear and missile experts are reported to
be working for the Chinese government, possibly with the
knowledge of Russian officials.  The consequent transfer of
technology could significantly improve China's ability to
produce and deliver nuclear weapons, which could have a
destabilizing influence on regional and global security.
Given the possibility of retransfers outside  China, such
Russian assistance might also contribute to development or
the improvement of nuclear weapons in other states.

The recent agreement by the United States and Russia to
verify mutually their nuclear weapon dismantlement will
strengthen the nuclear nonproliferation regime by
instituting an international arrangement to protect and
monitor the nuclear material recovered from the weapons.
This agreement was an important step by the two nations to
assure each other that nuclear weapons are indeed being
dismantled, as called for by the parallel nuclear
dismantlement initiatives of Presidents Bush and Gorbachev.
Inspections--at least of material storage sites, if not
actual dismantlement operations--are now planned on a
bilateral basis, and the International Atomic Energy Agency
is actively considering what role it might play in
monitoring nuclear materials recovered from weapons.

OPTIONS

o  The United States could expedite its assistance for
improving the managerial control, accounting, and physical
protection of nuclear material. The longer nuclear material
is inadequately protected in the FSU, the greater the
chances are for its diversion.  The most straightforward way
to reduce these risks would be to implement international
nuclear safeguards agreements between the nuclear inheritor
states and the International Atomic Energy Agency, and other
related assistance, as soon as possible.  To do this, a
large amount of preparation is needed in all four inheritor
states.  U.S. and other international help is essential if
this goal is to be accomplished quickly.

o  The United States could spend more of its assistance
funds directly in the former Soviet Union, thus helping to
stabilize the economic situation of individuals and
organizations that might otherwise face temptations to sell
sensitive information or materials to which they have
access.  Distributing U.S. funds in this way could be done
either by the Department of Defense taking a more permissive
interpretation of legislation requiring the use of U.S.
technology and experience "where feasible," as urged by
Congress in the fiscal year 1995 Defense Authorization bill,
or by explicit amendment of the original legislation.

o  The United States could consider the establishment in
Belarus and Kazakhstan of independent science and technology
centers, such as have been set up in Russia and intended for
Ukraine. A large number of nuclear scientists at the former
Soviet nuclear weapon test site in Kazakhstan are currently
at loose ends.  These scientists are seeking scientific
collaboration with the West and have identified a number of
opportunities for joint research.  Like elsewhere in the
former Soviet nuclear weapon complex, there is concern about
the consequences if the living and working conditions of
these scientists continue to deteriorate.

o  The United States and its partners may seek to expand and
expedite scientific cooperation with the FSU in ways other
than by establishing new science and technology centers.
For example, they may wish to expand the role of the
existing International Science and Technology Center in
Moscow or the center to be established in Kiev, and they may
wish to facilitate direct laboratory-to-laboratory
collaborations. Establishing close contacts and engaging in
collaborative activity with FSU scientists can reduce
temptations for them to work with would-be proliferant
states.  Moreover, joint research projects can give rise to
mutual scientific and economic benefits.

o  If reports of Russian/Chinese weapon collaboration are
confirmed, the United States could take the issue up in
contacts with the Russian government.  On the other hand, if
the United States were to press this issue, the Russians
might demand an increase in U.S. assistance to make up for
any resources that would be foregone if these collaborations
were to be terminated.

PROLIFERATION OF WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION: ASSESSING THE
RISKS--REPORT BRIEF

Recommended Citation: U.S. Congress, Office of Technology
Assessment, Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction:
Assessing the Risks, ISC-559 (Washington, DC: U.S.
Government Printing Office, August 1993).

GPO stock #052-003-01335-5; 132 p.; $7.00.
NTIS order #PB94-107612.
***********************************************************
Their indiscriminate and large-scale devastation--
particularly against unprotected civilians--differentiates
mass-destruction weapons from conventional ones. As
described in the OTA report, Proliferation of Weapons
of Mass Destruction: Assessing the Risks, a single nuclear
weapon can destroy a city. Chemical agents--poisons that
incapacitate, injure, or kill--can be deadly in amounts as
small as a few milligrams. Toxins, which are toxic
biological substances, are even more potent. But pound for
pound, infectious biological agents such as bacteria and
viruses can be the deadliest of all.

Even without sophisticated delivery systems, weapons of mass
destruction can be highly threatening. Deadly microorganisms
spread by terrorists, for example, might kill even more
people than if delivered by missile. Nevertheless, states
with highly capable delivery systems can inflict massive
damage quickly and reliably. At the same time, such delivery
systems--taken here to be ballistic missiles, cruise
missiles, and combat aircraft--are more amenable to
international controls than are less sophisticated delivery
systems such as ships, trucks, or civil airplanes.

******************************
*  THE PROLIFERATION THREAT  *
******************************

Although relatively few states currently appear to be
developing weapons of mass destruction, for the most part
these countries are located in unstable regions of the
world--the Middle East, South Asia, and the Korean
peninsula. For at least the next decade, few if any of these
states will be able to deliver such weapons more than a
thousand kilometers or so in a reliable and timely manner.
Therefore, the greatest threat posed by these states is to
their nearest neighbors and to regional political stability.
Despite the current limitations of their military delivery
systems, however, proliferant states--in principle--can
threaten any country on Earth using less sophisticated means
such as covert delivery or civil transportation systems.

*****************************************
*  RISKS FROM THE SOVIET UNION BREAKUP  *
*****************************************

The breakup of the Soviet Union has added a dangerous twist
to global security concerns. First, the new states of
Belarus, Kazahkstan, and Ukraine have Soviet nuclear weapons
within their borders; Belarus has committed itself to return
them to Russia, but the intentions of the other two states
are less clear. Second, if the nuclear custodial system in
Russia itself were to fail, nuclear weapon materials or
actual weapons might leak to potential proliferants
elsewhere in the world. Third, former Soviet republics might
export equipment, technology, or expertise useful for
producing weapons of mass destruction.

*************************************************
*  TECHNICAL ISSUES FOR PROLIFERATION CONTROLS  *
*************************************************

	o  The greatest single obstacle most countries would
face in the pursuit of nuclear weapons is obtaining
fissionable nuclear weapon material (enriched uranium or
plutonium). Although nuclear material production, weapon
fabrication, and testing require specialized equipment, in
many cases proliferants can make this equipment themselves
using tools and instruments that also have civilian uses.

	o  Most of the equipment needed to produce chemical
weapons has civilian applications. Some chemical-warfare
agents are simple to produce with widely available
equipment. Moreover, most of the same chemicals, or
precursors, used to make chemical agents are also used in
commercial products.

	o  Virtually all the equipment for producing biological
and toxin agents has civil applications and has become
available worldwide. Since militarily significant
quantities of biological agents could be produced in a short
time in small facilities, long-term stockpiles are not
needed. Biological agents can be disseminated crudely over a
broad area with commercially available equipment, but
sophisticated, precise delivery systems present major
technical obstacles. However, the United States overcame
these hurdles by the 1960s.

	o  Export controls will remain an important component
of nonproliferation policy. However, increased international
flows of technical knowledge, high-technology goods, and
trained specialists are eroding the ability to prevent
states of proliferation concern from acquiring technologies
relevant to producing weapons of mass destruction.

*******************************
*  NONPROLIFERATION POLICIES  *
*******************************

Three international treaties codify strong, if not yet
universal, norms against weapons of mass destruction. Some
150 nations have renounced nuclear weapons by joining the
Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as non-nuclear-weapon
states. The United States and many other nations have
forsworn chemical and biological weapons completely, even in
retaliation for in-kind attack, by joining the Chemical
Weapons Convention (more than 140 signatories) and the
Biological Weapons Convention (125 parties). Strengthened
nonproliferation norms might help deter potential
proliferants. More importantly, they also improve the
prospects of strong, coordinated world action to inhibit
proliferation and punish violators.

Strategies for inhibiting proliferation have four broad
elements:

	o  obstacles range from protection of weapon-related
information, to export controls, all the way to preemptive
military attack against production or storage facilities;

	o  punitive or deterrent measures include economic
sanctions or diplomatic isolation imposed on countries
developing these weapons, and on states, firms, or
individuals who assist in such developments;

	o  rewards such as development assistance (financial or
technical) that is tied to nonproliferation increase the
attractiveness of forgoing these weapons; and

	o  global or regional security improvements reduce the
perceived needs for the weapons.External obstacles and
disincentives can play an important
role in raising the costs of proliferation to a state
considering it, possibly tipping the balance towards
nonproliferation. Such coercive measures can also buy time
for other diplomatic or political measures to forestall the
development of weapons of mass destruction. However, in the
long run, the most effective nonproliferation measure is to
convince states that it is in their own best interests to
forgo weapons of mass destruction.

*****************************
*  ADDITIONAL PUBLICATIONS  *
*****************************

A separate background paper, Technologies Underlying Weapons
of Mass Destruction (to be released in fall, 1993), examines
the technical bases for nuclear, chemical, and biological
weapons, along with their delivery systems, and seeks to
identify opportunities to control or to monitor their
production. Another background paper, The Chemical Weapons
Convention: Effects on the U.S. Chemical Industry (released
in August 1993), discusses the implications of that treaty's
reporting and inspection requirements. A final publication,
to be issued in 1994, will provide more complete
specification and analysis of selected nonproliferation
policy options.

PROTECTING PRIVACY IN COMPUTERIZED MEDICAL INFORMATION--
REPORT BRIEF

Recommended Citation: U.S. Congress, Office of Technology
Assessment, Protecting Privacy in Computerized Medical
Information, TCT-576 (Washington, DC: U.S. Government
Printing Office, September 1993).

GPO stock #052-003-01345-2; 168 p.; $10.00.
NTIS order #PB94-107646.
***********************************************************
The Clinton administration's health care reform proposal
places substantial reliance on telecommunications and
information technology to reduce costs and improve health
care delivery. By linking computerized health information
through a national network, the system envisioned in the
proposal would allow an efficient exchange of information.
This capability could potentially improve patient care and
expand resources for medical research and education, while
lowering health care costs. While automation may or may not
achieve these goals, it will raise serious concerns about
individual privacy and proper use of the health care
information system.

Protecting Privacy in Computerized Medical Information
analyzes the implications of computerized medical
information and the challenges it brings to individual
privacy. OTA found that the present system of protection for
health care information offers a patchwork of codes, State
laws of varying scope, and Federal laws applicable only to
limited kinds of information. The present legal scheme does
not provide consistent, comprehensive protection for privacy
in health care information, and it is inadequate to guide
the health care industry with respect to obligations to
protect the privacy of medical information in a computerized
environment. The legal system fails to confront the reality
that, in a computerized system, information will regularly
cross State lines, and will therefore be subject to
inconsistent legal standards.

******************************************************
*  Why Is Privacy in Medical Information Important?  *
******************************************************Health information and the medical record reveal some of the
most intimate aspects of an individual's life. In addition
to diagnostic and testing information, the medical record
includes the details of a person's family history, genetic
testing, history of diseases and treatments, history of drug
use, sexual orientation and practices, and testing for
sexually transmitted diseases. Subjective remarks about a
patient's demeanor, character, and mental state are
sometimes a part of the record.

The medical record is also the primary source for much of
the health care information sought by parties outside the
direct health care delivery relationship. These data are
important because health care information can influence
decisions about an individual's access to credit, admission
to educational institutions, and his or her ability to
secure employment and obtain insurance. Inaccuracies in the
information, or its improper disclosure, can deny an
individual access to these basic necessities of life, and
can threaten an individual's personal and financial well-
being.

At the same time, accurate and comprehensive health care
information is critical to the quality of health care
delivery, and to the physician-patient relationship. Many
believe that the efficacy of the health care relationship
depends on the patient understanding that the information
recorded by a physician will not be disclosed. Without these
assurances, many patients might refuse to provide physicians
with certain types of information needed to render
appropriate care.

********************************************
*  The Computerization of Medical Records  *
********************************************

The health care industry is currently moving toward linking
institutions through a proposed information infrastructure
and communications networks. Linkages would allow transfer
of patient data from one care facility to another to
coordinate services, and would allow collation of clinical
records of each patient over time among providers and at
various health sites to provide a longitudinal record, one
that forms a cradle-to-grave view of a patient's health care
history. Electronically connecting the health care industry
by an integrated system of electronic communication networks
would allow any entity within the health care system to
exchange information and process transactions with any other
entity in the industry.

As a result of the linkage of computers, patient information
will no longer be maintained, accessed, or even necessarily
originate with a single institution, but will instead travel
among a myriad of facilities.

Smart cards have also been proposed as a means to
computerize and maintain health care information. Smart
cards can function to store information, which can be
accessed when a patient presents the card to a health care
practitioner, and/or as an access control device, carrying
out security functions to maintain a more secure and
efficient access control system for health care information
computer systems.

A major focus of security and confidentiality measures for
these systems is preventing privacy invasion by trusted
insiders. For online computer systems, security is generally
provided by use of user identification names and passwords,
and by menus to control access to computer system functions.
Some systems also use audit trails to record significant
events on a system. However, technology alone cannot
completely secure a system. Organizational education,
policies, and disciplinary actions supplement technical
protection for confidentiality. Smart cards can serve as an
access control device, providing the security functions that
are normally carried out by the user.

**********************************************************
*  Issues in Computerization of Health Care Information  *
**********************************************************

All health care information systems, whether paper or
computer, present confidentiality and privacy problems.
Computerization can reduce some concerns about privacy in
patient data and worsen others, but it also raises new
problems. Computerization increases the quantity and
availability of data and enhances the ability to link the
data, raising concerns about new demands for information
beyond those for which it was originally collected. The
potential for abuse of privacy by trusted insiders to a
system is of particular concern.

In addition, special policy problems are raised by
computerization. Proposed use of a unique patient identifier
assigned at birth and retained throughout a patient's
lifetime raises concerns among privacy advocates, who claim
that if the Social Security number is used for this purpose,
linkage of a wide variety of information resulting in
dossier type files on individuals would be possible.
Policies governing requirements for informed consent could
be challenged as well, since currently patients have limited
access to their health care record and may have little
choice in consenting to its disclosure for certain purposes.

***************************
*  Congressional Options  *
***************************

Health professional organizations, privacy advocates, and
academics specializing in health information privacy believe
that as computerization of patients' records goes forward,
Federal legislation is necessary to address issues of
patient confidentiality and privacy. Congress may wish to
enact a comprehensive health care information privacy law.
Such a law could:

	o  define the subject matter of the legislation,
"health care information," broadly, including the range of
information generated, collected, and maintained about
individual patients;

	o  provide criminal and civil sanctions for improper
possession, brokering, disclosure, or sale of health care
information with penalties sufficient to deter perpetrators;

	o  establish rules for patient education about
information practices as applied to health care information,
including access to information, amendment, correction and
deletion of information, and creation of databases;

	o  establish requirements for informed consent by
patients to disclosure of health care information;

	o  structure the law to track the flow of health care
information, incorporating the ability of computer security
systems to alert supervisors to leaks and improper access to
information so that the law can be applied to the
information at the point of abuse, not simply to one "home"
institution; and

	o  establish protocols for access to health care
information by secondary users, and determine their rights
and responsibilities in the information they access.

Congress may also wish to establish a special committee or
commission to oversee the protection of health care data; to
provide ongoing review of privacy issues arising in the area
of health care information; to keep abreast of developments
in technology, security measures, and information flow and
to advise Congress about privacy matters in the area of
health care information.

OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT
U.S. CONGRESS

OTA REPORT SUMMARY

***********************************************************
TEACHERS AND TECHNOLOGY: MAKING THE CONNECTION

Technology is a fact of American life. Computers, video,
television, telephones, radio, and telecommunications
networks exert an incalculable influence on how we live,
work, and play--an influence likely to expand as hardware
and software become more powerful and affordable.

New technologies are already essential tools for doing
business and are quickly becoming a primary means for people
to acquire information. Recognizing their responsibility to
prepare students to live and work in this technological
society, the nation's schools have often enlisted as
resources the most relevant technological innovations
available, whether television or telecommunications,
calculators or computers. OTA estimates that every year in
the past decade, schools have added between 300,000 and
400,000 computers to their inventories. Total public K-12
technology expenditures for 1993 were estimated at $2.13
billion.

"Teachers & Technology: Making the Connection", a newly
released report from the congressional Office of Technology
Assessment, suggests that, in the process of acquiring
hardware and software for students to use, teachers--perhaps
the most valuable part of the education equation--often have
been overlooked.

Given the nation's interest in improving education for
students, the lack of attention to teachers and technologies
is ironic, for at the center of effective use of
instructional technologies by students are those who oversee
the daily activities of the classroom--the teachers.  To use
new technologies well, teachers need more than just access
to these resources, they also need opportunities to discover
what the technologies can do,  to learn how to operate them,
and to experiment with ways to best apply them in their
classrooms.

There are 2.8 million teachers in K-12 public and private
schools today, and an estimated 3.3 million teachers will be
needed in schools by 2003.  Yet, the implications of how
technology can improve the preparation of new teachers or
enhance the continuing professional development of those
already in the field, are rarely considered. When teachers'
needs are discussed, the focus is often on providing short-
term, one-shot training to familiarize teachers with a
specific application or encourage general computer literacy.
Seldom have policy discussions or initiatives centered on
the relationship between technology and the teacher's role.
Seldom have they articulated a vision of how technology can
empower teachers to carry out all parts of their jobs--not
only the teaching, but administrative tasks, communication
with parents, and continuing professional development.

Making the connection between teachers and technology could
be one of the most important steps the nation can take to
make the most of past and continuing investments in
educational technology.  Helping teachers effectively
incorporate technology into the teaching and learning
process may not only help students become competent
technology users, but may also help them become more
accomplished learners overall, with skills necessary for the
information age.

OTA conducted this study at the request of the Senate
Committee on Labor and   Human Resources, with endorsement
by the House Committee on Education and Labor (now the House
Committee on Economic and Educational Opportunities) and by
a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee.  This
report seeks to underscore the connection between teachers
and effective implementation of technology in schools.

KEY FINDINGS

Some key findings include:

o  By spring 1995, schools in the United States will have an
estimated 5.8 million computers, or about one computer for
every nine students.  Almost every school in the country has
at least one television and videocassette recorder, and 41
percent of teachers have a TV in their classrooms, but only
one teacher in eight has a telephone in class and less than
1 percent have access to voice mail.  Classroom access to
technologies like CD-ROM and networks is similarly limited.
While 75 percent of public schools have access to some kind
of telecommunication capabilities (i.e., local- or wide-area
networks), and 35 percent of public schools have access to
the Internet, only 3 percent of instructional rooms
(classrooms, labs, and media centers) are connected to the
Internet.

o  Despite technologies available in schools, a substantial
number of teachers report they do not use computers and
other technologies regularly for instruction.

o  While technology is not a panacea for all educational
ills, today's technologies could be essential tools of the
teaching trade.  To use these tools well, teachers need
visions of the technologies' potentials, opportunities to
apply them, training and just-in-time support, and time to
experiment.

o  A majority of teachers report feeling inadequately
trained to use technology resources, particularly computer-
based technologies.  Although many teachers see the value of
students learning about computers and other technologies,
some are not aware of the resources technology can offer
them as professionals in carrying out the many aspects of
their jobs.

o  Although some schools have made progress in helping
teachers to use basic technological tools such as word
processing, they still struggle with curriculum integration,
which is central if technology is to become a truly
effective educational resource. Yet integration is a
difficult, time-consuming, and resource-intensive endeavor.

o  Technology can be a valuable resource for improving
teacher education.  It can bring models of the best teaching
live from the classroom into the colleges of education, or
provide video case studies of teaching styles and
approaches.  It can forge stronger connections among student
teachers, mentor teachers in the field, and university
faculty.

o  Despite the importance of technology in teacher
education, it is not central to the teacher preparation
experience in most U.S. colleges of education today.  Most
new teachers graduate from teacher preparation institutions
with limited knowledge of the ways technology can be used in
their professional practice.

o  The federal government has played a limited role in
technology-related teacher development compared with states,
universities, and school districts.  Even so, past federal
programs have piloted innovative educational applications of
technology for teachers by providing significant support for
professional development (especially among mathematics,
science, and special education teachers) and by providing
funding for technology-related professional development in
school districts that could not have supported it on their
own.

o  The federal government and the private sector have tended
to focus more on technology assistance and funding to K-12
schools than to colleges of education.  This approach may
address current needs but does not greatly influence teacher
preparation or quality over the long term.

POLICY OPTIONS

The array of technology for education is diverse, changing,
and flexible.  These characteristics enable development of
hardware, software, and learning environments that can suit
special needs, allow new approaches to teaching and
learning,  and create excitement in the classroom.  This
broad and expanding range of educational technologies
complements the diversity of the American education system.
While the appropriate federal role in education has always
been debated, policy decisions regarding technology can
allow for variation, change, experimentation, and differing
goals, building on the strong traditions of state and local
control of education and on emerging examples of public-
private partnerships.

If the federal government wants to support the expansion and
appropriate use of technologies in K-12 schools and colleges
of education, federal policy must go beyond funding.
Leadership; a commitment to research, development, and
dissemination; an increased emphasis on teachers; and
attention focused on issues related to the challenge of
school access to the emerging electronic telecommunications
infrastructure are equally critical. The private sector also
can play a greater role than it has in the past.

Federal leadership: legitimizing, funding, and targeting
technology

Legislation passed by the 103d Congress gave the signal that
technology is not only welcome but necessary in schools, and
that the federal government has a leadership and
coordinating role to play.  Programs authorized under the
Improving America's Schools Act (P.L. 103-382), especially
the major new technology education initiative under Title
III of the amendments to the Elementary and Secondary
Education Act of 1965 (ESEA) and Title II of the ESEA, the
Eisenhower Professional Development Program, could be the
centerpieces of a stronger federal role in providing
technology-related teacher development, ensuring greater
access and equity in the area of technology, and
demonstrating and disseminating several promising
educational applications.

The Office of Educational Technology--authorized in the 103d
Congress and given multiple responsibilities in the
Improving America's Schools Act--created a federal focal
point for educational technology for the first time. While
greater efforts to link teachers and technology were not
absolutely required, legislative language and the targeted
funds appropriated for fiscal year 1995 provided more
explicit congressional directives than ever before for
making those connections.

If the current Congress chooses to maintain support for
these activities, whether through new appropriations or
other  sources, it would send a signal that could strongly
influence state and local decisions over the next few years.

Regardless of what the Congress decides, the executive
branch has opportunity to provide the much-needed spotlight
on technology, to coordinate programs, and to take the lead
in evaluating and disseminating research results. For
example, the national long-range technology plan under
development by the Secretary of Education in accordance with
Goals 2000 (P.L. 103-227) offers a powerful policy tool for
federal leadership.  This plan could provide a long-overdue
strategy for the federal role in educational technology
across the government, and a framework for an environment of
experimentation, evaluation, and sharing of results.

Federal regulatory actions could include establishing
priorities or bonus points related to technology in
competitive grant programs, issuing policy statements
highlighting expenditures for technology and professional
development where the law permits, and eliminating
unnecessary nonstatutory restrictions on the use of funds
for technology or training purposes.  This could be a
particularly strong policy tool for leadership in areas
likely to continue to receive substantial funding, such as
the Title I program for disadvantaged students.

Research, development, and dissemination

Funders might be willing to make greater investments in
educational technology and related professional development
if there were better research suggesting the conditions
under which such investments would be most effective, and if
the results of available research were more widely
distributed.  Educational research and dissemination has
traditionally been a federal role.

Congress could direct the Department of Education or some
other entity to undertake research that examines the
effectiveness of various technology tools and applications,
including whether and how technologies work for teachers.
Fertile areas of federal research could include
investigations on whether using technology changes teaching
and, if so, for which teachers and under what conditions;
research on teachers as members of work groups and how the
teacher's work life is changed by technologies; and
alternate models of assigning teachers their time and duties
when technology takes over some roles.

It is widely believed that educational applications of new
technological developments often lag behind other
applications. Congress could direct federal executive branch
agencies to increase their support for continuing research
and development necessary for the production of powerful,
flexible learning tools and applications. The development of
the next generation of integrated curriculum products can
work hand-in-hand with proposed educational standards in all
curricular areas and could be undertaken as a national
research priority.  The federal government's seed money for
product development can be said to have resulted in a
sequential form of public-private partnership as technology
products or projects have been developed, tested, and
evaluated with federal support and later made commercially
available.

Alternatively, the federal government could opt not to
increase its role in education research and development, and
encourage development of new education technologies by the
private sector.  If Congress or the executive branch took
this approach, it would be worthwhile to study  whether K-12
schools and colleges of education,  with their persistent
constraints on resources, represent enough of a market for
educational technology product developers and how this
market might be aggregated.

In education there is a large gap between research findings
and their applications in day-to-day practice.  If it wants
teachers to use technologies wisely, Congress could continue
to encourage the use of technology--especially
telecommunications networks--as a dissemination tool to
share research results and get the results into the
classroom where teachers can use them.

Educating new teachers, professional development, and
teacher support

The executive branch could encourage states, universities,
and school districts to consider integrating technology into
various professional development activities--inservice and
preservice--supported under existing education legislation.
Particular attention should be focused on the recently
revised Eisenhower professional development program
(emphasized in P.L. 103-382), which calls for a larger
federal teacher professional development effort in several
subjects.  The use of technology as a tool to provide more
effective professional development  could be given greater
focus in all such programs.

Congress or the executive branch could require that all
applications for federal grants that include technology show
adequate budgets for preparation of staff and continuing
support. This could help to assure that teachers will be
given support over the long term, not just when the
technology is brought in the door.  Similarly, schools and
districts could seek such support from private sector
businesses.

The executive branch could on its own (or under Congress's
direction) encourage and support technology applications
when considering funding requests from schools and colleges
of education. Schools and colleges of education should be
encouraged to adopt teaching with technology so that new
teachers learn by example.

School access to the emerging telecommunications
infrastructure

The 104th Congress is once again considering revisions to
the Communications Act of 1934.  If Congress wants schools
and teachers to have access to the emerging national and
global telecommunications infrastructures, it may need to
consider carefully how different  approaches will affect
access by those in education.

It is becoming clear that access goes well beyond sheer
numbers of machines and includes access to information
available on those machines. Over the next decade, many
individual, local, state, federal, and business decisions
will determine whether this resource is broadly available or
greatly restricted.  Given the large federal role in
interstate telecommunications issues, if schools are not to
be left behind, Congress will need to pay close attention to
this issue as it debates regulatory and subsidy measures.

It is important to note that none of the options for federal
action discussed in this report necessarily requires a major
new investment of federal funds or a major direct federal
role. For example, none of them suggests that the federal
government step in and install new technologies in all K-12
schools or colleges of education, or create a new
bureaucracy for training teachers, or directly transfer
resources from the telecommunications sector to educational
institutions.  The options presented here--federal, private,
and local--are designed to support collaboration and
voluntary efforts by those schools and districts that desire
or require additional resources--and national
encouragement--to take advantage of and experiment with, new
educational technologies that show promise for teachers and
teaching.

*           TECHNOLOGIES FOR UNDERSTANDING AND            *
*        PREVENTING SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND ADDICTION         *
***********************************************************

The abuse of legal and illegal drugs represents a major
public health problem in the United States.  Direct costs
include thousands of premature deaths annually due to drug-
related illnesses, accidents, and homicides; economic
burdens related to health care, criminal justice, and lost
productivity; and the mental and physical pain suffered by
millions of Americans.  Many ills plaguing American
society--including the AIDS epidemic, increased crime and
violence, and homelessness--are linked to many Americans'
dependence on a variety of abusable substances.
*****************************
*  NECESSARY PRECONDITIONS  *
*****************************

No single or general set of variables explains the misuse of
alcohol and other drugs for every individual; in other
words, there are no "root causes" for substance abuse that
universally apply to everyone.  Nevertheless, OTA identified
three major sets of necessary preconditions that must be
present in order for substance abuse and addiction to occur:
biology and pharmacology, availability, and use and
transitions to abuse and dependency.

The first major set of preconditions includes biological and
pharmacological factors, without which drug abuse and
dependency would be impossible. Underlying all alcohol and
drug problems are the actions and effects that drugs of
abuse exert on the brain.  Biological factors that
contribute to substance abuse and addiction fall into two
groups: the effects drugs of abuse exert on the individual
in general, and the biological status of specific
individuals taking drugs. The effects the drugs exert can be
either acute or chronic and will vary depending on the drug
and its route of administration.  Most drugs of abuse
influence the brain's reward system.  The pleasurable
sensations that drug use can produce reinforce drug-seeking
and drug-taking behaviors.  These actions differ with
different drugs; thus, some substances have greater
potential for abuse and addiction than others.  Prolonged or
chronic use of a substance or substances can produce both
biological and behavioral changes (some long-lasting).
Biological changes can include sensitization and/or
tolerance to a substance and, if use is discontinued,
withdrawal.  Based on family, twin, and adoption studies,
most researchers agree that genetic factors play some part
in the acquisition of alcohol problems and, although less
clear, other drug problems.  However, no conclusive evidence
has been found to explain precisely what is inherited or the
overall importance of the inherited material.  It has been
hypothesized that numerous genes (as opposed to one)
interact in complex ways, and expression of those genes is
affected by a myriad of environmental factors.

Availability is the second precondition for drug abuse and
dependency.  A person cannot become a drug abuser unless a
drug is physically available. In addition, however,
availability is affected by social norms (e.g., factors
within the community conducive to drug use, including level
of parental or guardian supervision, lack of consequences
for alcohol and drug offenses, lack of alternative
activities, and portrayals of alcohol and other drug use by
friends and the media as a glamorous and healthy activity),
prices (economic availability), and personal values
(subjective availability).

The third set of preconditions for drug abuse and addiction
is drug use, including the progression to heavier and more
harmful use.  Researchers have focused on stages in the
progression of drug use in several ways.  They have studied
stages in the initiation of the use of different drugs,
finding a sequence that moves from the use of cigarettes and
wine or beer, to the use of marijuana, then hard liquor, and
finally other illicit drugs.  Because most individuals who
use drugs do not go on to abuse drugs, and because the use
of drugs at one level does not guarantee the use of drugs at
a higher level, these stages are descriptive but not
predictive.
************************
*  INDIVIDUAL FACTORS  *
************************

Much of the research on the causes of substance abuse and
addiction has focused on identifying individual risk factors
for alcohol and other drug use, specifically among
adolescents and young adults. Risk factors are those
cognitive, psychological, attitudinal, social,
physiological, and developmental characteristics that foster
initiation of drug and alcohol use and/or abuse by an
individual. Protective factors are those characteristics
that reduce the risk of substance use and abuse and promote
positive development, such as appropriate role models,
involvement in positive peer groups, and a positive self-
image and outlook for the future.

Researchers have studied individual risk and protective
factors from a number of perspectives, including
demographics (e.g., age, gender, or race and ethnicity of a
population), socioeconomic status (e.g., income, schooling,
neighborhood characteristics),and psychological and
behavioral characteristics (e.g., conditions such as
aggressiveness, delinquency, and mental disorders). While
research has revealed associations between certain
characteristics and patterns of substance use, it has not
revealed causality.
************************
*  COMMUNITY CONTEXTS  *
************************

A growing body of research is focusing on factors and
interventions relevant to the onset and prevention of
substance use, abuse, and dependency in the four principal
community activity settings: homes and families, schools and
peers, workplaces, and recreational settings.  In framing
prevention programs with divergent populations, researchers
are attempting to better understand qualitative as well as
quantitative research methods, and the variety of settings
in which substance abuse and addiction can take place and
can be combated.

Despite the promise of community-based research, several
problems exist.  First, much of the research does not
address substance abuse and addiction per se, but rather
risk and protective factors that can lead to a number of
outcomes, including substance abuse and addiction.  Second,
research studies vary widely in method, making it difficult
to draw scientifically valid conclusions.  Third, rigorous
evaluation of many prevention research programs is missing,
leaving open to debate whether such programs are effective.
********************
*  POLICY OPTIONS  *
********************

Issues related to substance abuse and addiction have long
occupied the attention of the American public and the
federal government.  A total of 12 executive branch
departments, four independent agencies, one multiagency
program (Weed and Seed), one White House office (the Office
of National Drug Control Policy--ONDCP), and the Judiciary,
all receive federal funding as part of national drug control
strategy.  Federal programs include drug interdiction,
treatment, and prevention programs.  The federal substance
abuse control policy has as its primary focus the
eradication of the supply of drugs.  Congress currently
appropriates more than $12 billion annually on antidrug
efforts, with approximately two-thirds of this amount
supporting drug interdiction and law enforcement activities,
and the remainder supporting demand-side activities, such as
drug treatment, research, and prevention programs.

OTA, in conjunction with the General Accounting Office,
surveyed federal agencies identified as having substance
abuse prevention efforts. OTA finds that substance abuse
prevention efforts are scattered over a number of federal
agencies, and that federal prevention efforts are dictated
by statutory mandates, rather than directed at identifying
causes of substance abuse and addiction per se.  ONDCP,
charged with coordinating federal antidrug efforts, lacks
the statutory mandate to forcibly integrate or alter the
multitude of programs that make up the federal government's
war on drugs.
Congress faces several fundamental difficulties in
addressing the causes of substance abuse and addiction:

o  No scientific consensus exists as to what is the driving
cause of substance abuse and addiction. A range of risk and
protective factors have been associated with drug use,
abuse, and addiction.

o  Federal antidrug efforts, though coordinated by ONDCP,
are spread among many federal agencies, whose authorization
and appropriations are the subject of action by numerous
congressional committees and subcommittees. ONDCP efforts in
drug demand reduction efforts alone involved the efforts of
federal agencies across at least 11 Cabinet-level
departments. This makes coordinated legislative action
difficult to achieve.

o  The federal budget deficit is an obstacle to the creation
of new domestic programs or enhancement of existing programs
that target known risk and protective factors in individuals
and communities. The framework and literature reviews
presented in this report make clear that substance abuse and
addiction can arise and be influenced by multiple factors in
individuals, groups, and communities.  Thus, effective
intervention requires prevention practitioners to select
from a variety of options, so they can target the specific
factors that are especially important for the particular
populations and communities they are addressing.  This does
not mean that everything must be done at once nor that
everything be known in advance of taking action.  To the
contrary, policymakers and practitioners can take small
steps at a time, and then, as resources and new knowledge
permit, take additional steps that address a fuller range of
factors and contexts in greater depth.

o  Current drug prevention programs lack scientifically
accepted standards for determining their success or failure.
Whatever methods are developed, tested, and incorporated
into prevention programs, a critical component of success
should be careful, rigorous evaluation.  Answering "what
works?" is essential in making advances in preventing
substance abuse.

In choosing which policy issues to address, OTA focused on
those areas directly addressed in this study.  OTA
identified a series of policy issues in four broad
categories: federal focus and prevention program structure,
research needs, community activity settings, and
availability. A number of policy questions and options for
congressional action emerge from these four categories. A
full discussion of the policy issues and options for
congressional action can be found in chapter 9 of the full
report.

THE CONTINUING CHALLENGE OF TUBERCULOSIS--REPORT BRIEF

Assessment, H-574 (Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing

***********************************************************
After declining for over 30 years, the number of new cases
of tuberculosis (TB) reported each year in the United States
is now on the rise, having increased 20 percent since 1985.
In The Continuing Challenge of Tuberculosis, OTA synthesizes
current scientific understanding of TB in this country and
considers the Federal role in its control.

In addition to the 26,673 reported cases in the United
States in 1992, an estimated 10 to 15 million people are
infected with the bacteria that cause TB but are not sick.
Over the years, TB has also become more concentrated among
particular portions of the population, especially
economically-disadvantaged people, racial and ethnic
minorities, and foreign-born individuals. Particularly
disturbing is the emergence of TB strains resistant to the
most commonly used drug treatments.

Unchecked, these recent trends represent a serious threat to
communities already saddled with poor health, poverty, and
other social problems. This threat is greatest for people
with HIV. Furthermore, the disease could become an
additional major burden to the Nation's health care system.

No one single factor has brought about this new threat.
Rather, it has multiple causes, including HIV, homelessness,
incarceration, immigration from countries with high levels
of TB, and reduced resources available for TB control.

************************
*  ABOUT TUBERCULOSIS  *
************************

To develop active TB that is contagious and causes illness,
an individual must first be infected with the bacillus
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb.). On average, only 10
percent of otherwise healthy adults infected with M.tb. ever
develop active TB. People with higher risk are children,
people with HIV, and those with chronic illnesses. Active TB
can affect various parts of the body, with the lungs being
the most common. If untreated, TB can result in destruction
of affected parts of the body and death.

********************
*  MAJOR FINDINGS  *
********************

Here are some of the report's other major findings:

******************************
*  The Risk of Tuberculosis  *
******************************

	o  To be infected, an individual must breathe an
airborne particle containing M.tb. expelled by a contagious
person. Brief, casual contact with an infectious person is
unlikely to lead to infection, but the risk is not zero.

	o  Co-infection with HIV greatly increases an
individual's chances of progressing to active TB to an
estimated 8 percent chance per year. Drug-susceptible TB is
treatable among most people with HIV except during the most
advanced stages of HIV disease.

	o  The full extent of multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB)
is unknown because the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) only began regularly collecting drug-
susceptibility data on each reported case of TB in 1993.

****************
*  Prevention  *
****************

	o  The effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of
individual infection control technologies--including various
types of masks, ventilation devices, and germicidal
ultraviolet lights--have not been well studied for their
ability to reduce risk of M.tb. infection in clinical
settings.

	o  Screening for M.tb. infection and the provision of
preventive therapy could be an effective strategy to control
drug-susceptible TB among high-risk individuals under 35 and
uninfected with HIV. Implementation has been limited by the
availability of funding and other resources, and a lack of
knowledge about the most cost-effective methods of providing
these services.

***************
*  Treatment  *
***************

	o  The prices of drugs to treat drug-susceptible TB
have increased at an average annual rate of about 9 percent
per year since 1986. Prices of some drugs used to treat
drug-resistant TB have increased at a higher rate.

	o  On average, 75 percent of U.S. TB patients complete
treatment within a year, although completion rates vary
greatly across the country.

	o  Treatment failure can result from prescribing
errors, a lack of resources for accessible, high-quality TB
services, and patients' unwillingness or inability to
complete treatment. To design better TB services, there is
great need to document the relative importance of each of
these factors.

	o  A combination of treatment strategies, including
supervised treatment, is needed. However, the extent of
supervision necessary to achieve higher rates of treatment
completion is uncertain and probably varies by community.
Little systematic evidence on the cost-effectiveness of
alternative approaches exists to guide the design of such
services.

	o  One form of supervised treatment, directly observed
therapy (DOT), can be very effective in achieving treatment
completion. However, at a cost of $2,000 to $3,000 per
patient above that of unsupervised therapy, it probably
would not be the most cost-effective strategy for patients
who appear to be completing treatment through less intensive
strategies.

*************************
*  Federal Involvement  *
*************************

	o  TB control is primarily a public health task that
will not be achieved or greatly helped by reform of health
care insurance and financing.

	o  The Federal Government provides major funding,
technical expertise, leadership, and coordination of the
Nation's TB control efforts with CDC playing the lead role.
Although the executive branch has detailed the efforts
necessary to combat TB in a national action plan, it has not
requested sufficient funds from Congress to implement these
plans.*************************
*  OPTIONS TO CONSIDER  *
*************************

Among the congressional options OTA identifies and analyzes
in its report are the following:

	Option:

	Fully fund the public health activities

	identified in the CDC's 1992 National

	Action Plan to Combat Multidrug-

	Resistant Tuberculosis.

Full funding of the 1992 National Action Plan, estimated to
be $484 million for CDC alone in 1994, would dramatically
increase resources available for TB control and alert the
country to the threat posed by this disease. On the other
hand, the public health and research infrastructure may
currently lack the capacity to absorb such a large influx of
cash as efficiently as it could if the increases came more
gradually.

	Option:

	Establish a mechanism for direct Federal intervention
in cities and other jurisdictions with extraordinarily high
levels of active tuberculosis, MDR-TB, or HIV and TB
coinfection.

This option would require that the Federal government define
more precisely the criteria by which it would decide to
intervene and how it would staff such an effort. In
addition, decisionmakers would need to consider whether
Federal intervention would be more cost-effective than local
governments and private organizations acting alone.

	Option:

	Directly purchase anti-tuberculosis drugs and
distribute them to State and local authorities.

CDC currently has the statutory authority to purchase all
anti-TB drugs used by State and local governments. Shifting
the cost of drug purchasing to the Federal government would
provide additional funds to State and local governments for
other purposes. Although CDC estimates that such purchases
would cost $80 million in 1993, the actual cost-savings that
could be achieved through such large-volume purchases are
difficult to predict. The pharmaceutical industry has
suggested that centralized, discounted purchases would
provide a disincentive for firms to invest in research to
develop new anti-TB drugs by limiting revenues needed to
recoup initial research and development expenses for these
new drugs.

	Option:

	Support the creation of additional regional "centers of
excellence" for TB treatment, research, and training.

It is not clear that additional "centers of excellence" are
the most efficient means of achieving their goals. In
addition, it is not clear what number of such centers would
be commensurate with the threat posed by TB.

********************************************************
The Social Security Administration distributes benefit
payments to more than 47 million people each month, and
about $350 billion in total benefit payments each year.
Millions of older, disabled, and/or low-income Americans
depend on SSA benefits to make ends meet. Over 200 million
people have Social Security numbers that are widely used for
recordkeeping and identification purposes.  And SSA tracks
the earnings and accrued benefits of over 140 million
working Americans.

An ever-increasing workload, combined with staff reductions,
threatens SSA's ability to meet congressional and public
expectations for service delivery.

To carry a growing workload, SSA is placing high hopes on
its next round of technology modernization--a 5-year,
$1.125-billion automation investment fund commonly referred
to as the IWS/LAN Technology Program. IWS/LAN is short for
intelligent workstation (IWS) and local area network (LAN).
The workstations are current generation, off-the-shelf
microcomputers (i.e., personal computers or PCs),
and the LANs are a widely implemented means of
interconnecting microcomputers in local networks that can,
in turn, be tied together into larger networks.

**************
*  FINDINGS  *
**************

In its report The Social Security Adminis-tration's
Decentralized Computer Strategy: Issues and Options, the
Office of Technology Assessment concludes that SSA's planned
evolution from "dumb" terminals (with only minimal local
processing or storage capability) to networked
microcomputers is well within widely accepted government and
private sector practice. Many agencies and companies have
already made this transition.

It is important to emphasize, however, that SSA's IWS/LAN
technology planning and testing are well ahead of the
agency's understanding of how to use IWS/LAN to upgrade
service delivery. SSA's strategic and information systems
planning has improved markedly in recent years, but service
delivery planning is lagging. A tighter connection needs to
be made between the technology and the expected improvements
in service delivery to make best use of IWS/LAN.

To strengthen the planning for service delivery, it will be
necessary to allocate more staff to the planning group and
assure that the group has authority for integrated strategic
planning and management that cut across all SSA offices and
programs. Also, while SSA's current electronic delivery
program is exploring or using a wide range of technologies
and applications, it is underfunded and is missing some key
information technology opportunities--such as online
services (see figure).  As a consequence, SSA is not
developing a complete understanding of what role IWS/LAN
technology should play in the larger context of electronic
delivery.  And SSA's planning and budgeting system is not
yet being used to estimate the costs, benefits, and
performance impacts of IWS/LAN.  This will be difficult to
do well until service delivery planning improves.

Determining eligibility for disability benefits is
acknowledged as the most troubled SSA service and is the
current focus of SSA's reengineering efforts. OTA's review
indicates that the states strongly support the modernization
of state Disability Determination Service offices, but have
concerns about a range of technical and procurement matters.
SSA has addressed these concerns over the past year.  But
continuing differences in federal and state perspectives
suggest that a joint SSA-state review is needed to further
streamline the modernization process and make best use of
available funds.

*********************************
*  POLICY OPTIONS FOR CONGRESS  *
*********************************

The primary congressional policy options relevant to this
OTA review involve the timing, levels, allocations, and
conditions of funding for SSA's current automation program.

Options for Obligation of FY 1994 Appropriation

Congress could:

	1.  Request SSA to defer the IWS/LAN procurement (and
obligation of funds appropriated for FY 1994);

	2.  Allow SSA to proceed as planned; or

	3.  Permit SSA to proceed with a modified procurement
that reflects the results of the agency's interim
reengineering and service delivery planning, this OTA
review, and the General Accounting Office's continuing
evaluation.

Early milestones that would increase OTA's confidence in the
agency's ability to fully utilize IWS/LAN technology and
significantly improve service delivery include the SSA: 1)
satisfactorily completing the disability reengineering
report; 2) strengthening its service delivery planning
process; 3) improving the balance and funding for its
portfolio of electronic delivery projects; and 4) initiating
an SSA-state review of the disability modernization program.

SSA could reprogram a percentage of FY 1994 funds (e.g., 5
percent) for use in reengineering and in implementation of
the Agency Strategic Plan--including service delivery
planning and testing.

SSA also could reprioritize the FY 1994 IWS/LAN procurement
to cover offices and locations that offer the greatest near-
term leverage for improving services, and are most likely to
remain stable under a range of reengineering and
reorganization scenarios.

Options for FY 1995 Appropriation

Congress could:

	1.  Provide zero funding for IWS/LAN in FY 1995;

	2.  Provide the requested funding ($130 million) with
no strings attached;

	3.  Provide FY 1995 or 1995-96 funding ($130 million or
$385 million) with strings attached; or

	4.  Provide full multiyear funding ($825 million for FY
1995-98).

OTA believes that SSA may be able to justify the $130
million for FY 1995 if the agency continues to improve its
service delivery planning, among other areas.  Appropriating
FY 1995 (and perhaps FY 1996) funds with conditions and
modifications would allow SSA to continue generally on
schedule, but with added incentives to assure the best use
of available monies.  This option should help keep the
IWS/LAN program on track while, at the same time, permitting
more effective congressional oversight and holding SSA more
accountable for performance.

In OTA's judgment, the advisability of appropriating FY
1995-96 monies in the FY 1995 budget cycle depends
significantly on SSA's ability to meet early milestones for
use of the FY 1994 appropriation.  Appropriations beyond FY
1996 are not prudent at this time, in OTA's view, given the
lack of clarity and documentation for use of the out-year
funds.

Congress also could attach conditions to SSA's general
operating funds. These funds total about $5 billion (of
which about $400 million funds the SSA annual information
technology budget)--all separate and apart from the 5-year,
$1.125-billion SSA automation investment program. Funds
could be reprogrammed or prioritized within the SSA
operating budget to cover reengineering and service delivery
priorities.  Funds might also be used to strengthen SSA's
strategic management, which OTA believes is key to SSA's
ultimate success in improving service delivery.

<title>U.S.-Russian Cooperation in Space</title>

REPORT BRIEF

*
U.S.-RUSSIAN COOPERATION IN SPACE
*

The end of the Cold War, the collapse of the  Soviet Union,
and  the  changing world order have provided new
opportunities and new incentives for the United States and
other countries to cooperate with Russia in space science,
space applications, and human spaceflight.  A new OTA
report, U.S.-Russian Cooperation in Space, examines these
opportunities and discusses potential benefits and risks
to the United States.  Although U.S. attempts to cooperate
on space activities with the Soviet Union began more than
30 years ago, intense political and military competition
between the two countries severely limited the scope and
duration of such activities.  Today, the United States
government is actively pursuing cooperation with Russia
on a wide range of space activities, including the
International Space Station.  In addition, U.S. aerospace
firms have entered into joint ventures, licensing
agreements, and cooperative technical agreements with
a variety of newly organized Russian counterparts.

The emergence of Russia as a major cooperative partner for
the United States and other spacefaring nations offers the
potential for a significant increase in the world's
collective space capabilities.  Expanding U.S.-Russian
cooperation in space since 1991 has begun to return
scientific, technological, political, and economic benefits
to the United States.  Yet, Russia is experiencing severe
economic hardship and its space program has undergone major
structural changes.  The future success of U.S.-Russian
cooperative projects in space will depend on:

o successful management of complex, large-scale bilateral
and multilateral cooperative projects;

o progress in stabilizing Russia's political and economic
institutions;

o preservation of the viability of Russian space
enterprises;

o flexibility in managing cultural and institutional
differences;

o continued Russian adherence to missile-technology-
proliferation controls; and

o additional progress in liberalizing U.S. and Russian laws
and regulations in export control, customs, and finance.

-----------------------------------------------------------
KEY RUSSIAN ELEMENTS IN THE CRITICAL PATH OF THE
INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION

o  Guidance, navigation, and control of the Phase Two
station depends on the Functional Cargo Block (FGB)
module, purchased from Khrunichev Enterprise by
Lockheed.

o  Reboosting the space station, to prevent premature
reentry caused by atmospheric drag, will depend on a
series of Russian Progress-M and Progress-X cargo
spacecraft (the latter is an enlarged version that
does not yet exist).

o  Russia will be responsible for crew-return ("lifeboat")
capability in the period before planned space station
completion (1997-2002).

o  Fuel resupply is also a Russian-only function, under
current plans.

Research Service Issue Brief 93017, Washington, DC,

-----------------------------------------------------------

FOREIGN POLICY BENEFITS AND RISKS

Russia's technical contributions to the International Space
Station offer a substantial increase in planned space
station capabilities.  Just as important to the United
States are the foreign policy gains from this and other
human spaceflight projects, such as the Shuttle-Mir
dockings.  U.S. officials expect cooperative activities to
help promote economic and political stability in Russia.
For example, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's (NASA's) purchase of nearly $650 million in
goods and services from Russia during fiscal years 1994-97,
by far the largest transfer of U.S. public funds to the
Russian government and private organizations, is an
important signal of U.S. support for Russia's transition to
a market economy.  These purchases should help preserve
employment for Russian engineers and technicians in at least
some of Russia's major space-industrial centers, thereby
inhibiting proliferation through "brain drain" and helping
to sustain Russian adherence to the Missile Technology
Control Regime.  Moreover, NASA's purchases improve the
chances that Russia will be able to meet its obligations to
the space station project, thereby enhancing prospects for
success.

Nevertheless, such purchases entail some political risk in
the United States, as well as the risk to the space station
if the Russian government and enterprises are not able to
perform.  Some U.S. observers question the wisdom of
supporting any part of the Russian aerospace industry, which
provided much of the technological substance for the Soviet
threat to the United States; others believe that U.S.
officials have made adequate provision to ensure that U.S.
funds remain in the civil space sector.

OTHER BENEFITS AND RISKS

NASA is exploring cooperative space research and development
with Russia in virtually every programmatic area.  Aside
from the space station, activities include flights of
instruments on each other's spacecraft and joint missions
using Russian launch capabilities with U.S.-built
spacecraft.  Public sector cooperation in space science and
Earth observations is developing well for the most part.
The political, technical, and administrative risks involved
are somewhat higher than they are in NASA's traditional
cooperative relationships, but--except for the space
station--Russian contributions are not in the "critical
path" to completion of key projects; program managers
understand the risks involved and have made contingency
plans to minimize long-term risks.

Cooperation on projects involving human spaceflight involves
both potentially greater programmatic benefits and higher
risks than it does in space science and applications.  The
United States stands to gain new experience in long-duration
spaceflight and a better understanding of Russia's
technology and methods.  On the other hand, the United
States risks possible project failure if Russia proves
unable to perform as promised.

Placing the Russian contribution in the critical path to
completion of the space station poses unprecedented
programmatic and political risks.  The Russian elements must
be delivered on time and within budget; failure to do so
could cause serious difficulties, both programmatically and
in NASA's relations with its other partners and with
Congress.  Knowledgeable observers express concern about the
stability and staying power of the Russian aerospace sector,
about the Russian track record in delivering new spacecraft,
and about the condition of the Baikonur launch complex (used
to launch Proton and Soyuz vehicles).  On another level,
observers worry that political and/or military events within
Russia or between Russia and other countries could cause
either party to seek to amend the space station program or
withdraw from it.

Given the significance of the Russian contribution to the
space station, the U.S. ability to make up for delays or
failure to deliver is severely limited by available U.S.
resources.  However, participants in current cooperative
ventures suggest some other precautions that could be taken,
both in the space station project and in space robotic
cooperation:

o Seek better understanding of the larger political and
economic forces that could affect Russian ability to deliver
on commitments, perhaps through further systematic analysis
of  Russian aerospace industry developments.

o Maximize open and frank communication.  To avoid as many
technical and managerial surprises as possible, seek (and be
willing to allow) a high degree of communication and
interpenetration between the U.S. and Russian programs.

o Be prepared for delays and reverses.

o Be aware of and manage cultural differences effectively.

COMMERCIAL COOPERATION

Because of the potential for diverting civilian space
technologies to enhance Soviet military capabilities, during
the Cold War, the federal government effectively precluded
U.S. aerospace firms from entering into cooperative business
agreements with Russian entities.  Now, most large U.S.
aerospace companies are pursuing some form of joint venture
or partnership with Russian concerns, especially in launch
services and propulsion technologies.  Although several of
these emerging commercial partnerships show promise, and
some could result in large revenues, none of them yet appear
to be profitable, and it is too early to tell how successful
they will be.  Here, too, the risks are larger than they are
in cooperative ventures with Japanese and Western aerospace
firms because of unstable Russian political, economic, and
legal conditions and potential linkage to U.S.-Russian
political relations.  The U.S. government could assist U.S.
industry by further liberalizing U.S. export-control laws
and regulations.

RUSSIA, THIRD PARTIES, AND THE UNITED STATES

The French experience in cooperating with the Soviet Union
and Russia since 1966 largely parallels and confirms that of
the United States.  The European Space Agency has budgeted
over $320 million for space cooperation with Russia, largely
for European-built hardware that will be installed in the
Russian portion of the International Space Station.

The U.S. decision to bring Russia into the space station
partnership initially caused considerable strain in
relations with the existing partners, already frayed by
years of U.S. design changes and cost increases and
aggravated by a general cooling of public enthusiasm for
human spaceflight.  Challenging negotiations remain to
complete the realignment of the agreements covering the
station's construction and utilization, but the working
relationships now appear to be developing more smoothly.

DOMESTIC ECONOMIC IMPACT

Experts disagree over the nature and extent of the effect
that expanded cooperation with Russia will have on the U.S.
aerospace industry, and particularly on the retention of
U.S. jobs.  Some industry officials have expressed concern
that U.S. aerospace employment could be lost and the
technological base adversely affected by use of Russian
technology in the U.S. space program.  Others have argued
that skillful incorporation of Russian technologies into
U.S. projects could save taxpayer dollars in publicly funded
programs such as the space station and could boost U.S.
international competitiveness in commercial programs.  Both
could happen and have to be weighed against each other.

Russian launch vehicles and related systems have the most
obvious potential for U.S. commercial use, but using them
could adversely affect the U.S. launch industry.  This
industry is the subject of upcoming OTA reports.

U.S. TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES IN EUROPEAN MARKETS--
REPORT BRIEF

Recommended Citation: U.S. Congress, Office of Technology
Assessment, U.S. Telecommunications Services in European
Markets, TCT-548 (Washington, DC: U.S. Government Printing
Office, August 1993).

***********************************************************
American telecommunications companies are rushing to enter
European markets--and finding they have a competitive edge.
Experience in deregulated markets has taught them to respond
to corporate users' needs with innovative services, while
some European counterparts are still resisting market
liberalization.

In U.S. Telecommunications Services in European Markets, OTA
notes that only 15 percent of the aggregate
telecommunications market in Europe has so far been opened
to U.S. competition--primarily cellular communications,
cable television, and some enhanced services. In most
countries, basic telephone services are still a monopoly of
the state-owned Public Telephone Operators (PTOs).

The European market is, OTA concludes, likely to be forced
open by growing pressure from European business users, whose
needs the PTOs have been slow to meet. Other factors are
also operating to liberalize markets: the GATT negotiations
on trade in services, advances in network technology, and a
European Community Open Network Directive. The Directive
opens the door for large users to bypass public switched
networks if PTOs remain recalcitrant.

*************************************
*  A PLUS FOR THE NATION'S ECONOMY  *
*************************************

The consistent U.S. surplus in trade in services partially
offsets the larger continuing deficit in merchandise trade.
Increased export of value-added telecommunications services
can help to swell that surplus. The European markets for
these services are projected by OTA to grow much faster than
U.S. markets, which show signs of saturation. Growth
opportunities for U.S. carriers may depend heavily on
success in foreign markets.

Delivery of services to foreign customers also encourages
them to buy U.S. telecommunications equipment, providing
even more leverage for the U.S. economy. In addition, U.S.
carriers and their global networks strengthen the
competitiveness of other U.S. services industries--such as
airlines, hotels, and banks--in European markets.
Participation in world markets by high-tech services firms
stimulates growth and innovation and tends to create, rather
than destroy, domestic jobs.

***********************************
*  A MINIMUM ROLE FOR GOVERNMENT  *
***********************************

There appears little need for government action to stimulate
U.S. firms to enter foreign telecommunications services
markets--other than to continue to press trading partners to
increase market access for U.S. firms. Negotiators are
struggling to resolve the imbalance in markets: there are
relatively few restrictions on foreign firms in U.S.
telecommunications markets, while some European nations are
insisting on preserving their PTOs' monopolies on basic
voice services.

In the mid-1980s, the Bell operating companies entered
European markets in part because they were restricted from
engaging in some activities at home by court order (long-
distance service, equipment manufacturing, information
services), or by legislation (cable television). The current
debate over ending or reconfirming these restrictions need
not, however, turn on considerations of international
competitiveness. Growing, liberalized European markets would
continue to attract U.S. carriers even if domestic
restrictions were lifted. If that occurred, the Bell
operating companies expect that their experience in building
and operating cable systems in Europe could be turned to
advantage in the United States.

*****************************************
*  TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND TRADE POLICY  *
*****************************************

Intelligent networks using computerized switching and
sophisticated databases, rapid data transmission, and
multimedia services are destroying traditional distinctions
between "basic" voice services and value-added services, and
between public and private networks. These distinctions are
deeply embedded in existing regulations and in negotiating
positions developed by the Office of the U.S. Trade
Representative (USTR). Trade agreements based on such
obsolete distinctions will rapidly become either ineffective
or overly restrictive. This problem is serious because the
USTR has assumed the dominant role in formulating
international telecommunications policy.

The United States lacks a comprehensive international
telecommunications policy incorporating a vision of the
global networks of the future. The dispersed
responsibilities and competing agendas of several executive
branch agencies and the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) encourage "forum-shopping" by carriers, services
providers, and large users. The Department of State's Bureau
of International Communications and Information Policy (CIP)
has the legislated responsibility for coordinating agency
programs and initiatives, but is largely ineffective in this
role for structural, political, and institutional reasons.
USTR has filled the gap, but because international
telecommunications policy has become overly subordinated to
trade policy, other objectives (e.g., standards setting,
inter operability, universal service) have been neglected.

*****************************************************
*  OVERSEAS INVESTMENT AND DOMESTIC INFRASTRUCTURE  *
*****************************************************

Direct (electronic) export of value-added communications
services will increase. In order to get the full benefits of
the European Community's "one market," however, most
European activities of U.S. carriers will continue to be
through joint ventures and other forms of partnering with
European firms. This increasing investment overseas by U.S.
carriers has raised concerns that it drains capital from
investment in domestic infrastructure modernization and in
research and development.

Policymakers do not have reliable information to evaluate
that speculation. Because of deregulation and a decline in
reporting requirements, available data are not adequate to
definitively determine whether infrastructure investment has
significantly declined since foreign investment began, and
if so, whether it is declining because of increasing foreign
investment or other causes, such as divestiture and
deregulation. The risk can neither be documented or
dismissed; its potential importance means that steps are
needed to improve the information available to State and
Federal legislators and regulators.

**************************
*  OPTIONS FOR CONGRESS  *
**************************

Congress could improve the evaluation of the effects of
foreign investment by regulated carriers, at little
additional cost to industry, through alternative means:
mandating additional FCC monitoring, asking for a
restructuring of data currently collected by the Bureau of
the Census, or initiating a cooperative program with State
utility regulators. Congressional action may also be needed
to strengthen the policymaking structure for international
telecommunications, if this is not done by the
Administration, either by taking steps to enhance the
ability of the State Department's CIP, or by legislation
eliminating CIP and lodging the coordination function in the
Executive Office. Finally, Congress itself could articulate
a more comprehensive U.S. policy for international
communications.

<H2>802.5 16/4 Token Ring Network Interface Cards</H2>

<H4>Models: M8116/SA, M8117/SA, M8118/SA, M8119/SA, M8120/SA,
M8121/SA</H4>
<HR>

<H3>SUMMARY</H3>

<P>
The Racore <I>Server Accelerator Series is</I> designed to increase
the throughput in network servers and &quot;power user&quot; workstation
applications. The Server Accelerator Series 16/4 Mbps switchable
Token Ring network interface cards are designed for the 16-bit
ISA bus, the 16/32-bit PS/2 Micro Channel bus system, and the
32-bit EISA bus.
<P>
Racore Token Ring adapters will operate in virtually any Token
Ring network environment, offering true compatibility, fast performance
and flexibility.
<P>
Utilizing the onboard processor of the Texas Instrument's TMS38OC2X
chipset, Racore 16/4 adapters are compatible with the IEEE 802.2
and 802.5 standards. Racore adapter cards can be used exclusively
or intermixed with currently installed IBM Token Ring or other
vendor adapter cards.
<P>
Racore Token Ring network interface cards with the appropriate
drivers are compatible with software packages such as IBM PC Network
Program or the Advanced Program-to-Program Communications (APPC)
package.
<P>
Racore's high speed bus master DMA 1/0 takes control of the computer
bus and transfers data directly into memory. The CPU is off-loaded,
minimizing 1/0 bottlenecks. Data transfer rates are improved,
providing enhanced performance in busy server environments. With
the addition of the Frame Processing Accelerator co-processor,
data throughput soars on overloaded networks.
<P>
Racore seff-configuring drivers and Flash diagnostics are easy
to install and use. The Flash ROM consumes only 8K of system ROM
space.
<H3>FEATURES</H3>

<UL>
<LI><B>Frame Processing Accelerator</B>
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Frame Processing Accelerator feature can dramatically eliminate
receive congestion errors on a network. The small packet throughput
is double that of the highly rated Racore Workstation Series of
network adapters. The Server Accelerator series of network adapters
has a co-processor that manages the adapter buffers, communicates
with the host system, and transmits and receives frames, vastly
improving throughput and overall network performance.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<UL>
<LI><B>802.2 LLC, plus RPL</B>
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
802.2 Logical Link Control (LLC) is standard as a Flash-based
feature. LLC provides access to ISO and SNA protocols, supplying
compatibility with the following software environments: IBM PC
Network Program, IBM OS/2 Extended Services, IBM LAN Server, Novell
NetWare 286, Novell NetWare 386, Novell OS/2 Requester, and Microsoft
LAN Manager (NDIS), Artisoft LANtastic, Banyan VINES for workstations
&amp; support for APPC/PC, NETBIOS and 3270 emulation. Remote
Program Load (RPL) is also standard.

<UL>
<LI><B>Onboard Memory</B>
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Racore 16/4 Token Ring adapters accommodate user requirements
for servers with 512K RAM standard. This feature provides the
extra data buffering needed in a heavily loaded, high speed 16Mb
network and enables support of maximum link stations for bridges
and servers under heavy network traffic.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<UL>
<LI><B>Onboard Connection</B>
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
An onboard DB9 connector provides connection to Type 1 STP cabling
on all of the Server Accelerator series adapters. An onboard Type
3 UTP media filter is a standard feature for the M8116/SA, M8119/SA,
and the M8120/SA for inexpensive connection to unshielded twisted
pair cabling. Connection to Type 3 UTP cabling is provided through
an RJ45 (RJl 1 compatible) connector. Fiber Optic connection is
standard on the M8117/SA, M8118/SA and the M8121 /SA.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>RACORE PRODUCT LINE</H3>

<P>

<H1>Corporate Overview</H1>
<HR>

<H3>The Company</H3>

<P>
Racore designs, develops, manufactures, and markets a full line
of Local Area Network products, with emphasis on Token-Ring. Since
its inception in 1983, the company's focus has been to introduce
products based on leadingedge technology that benefit users with
increased performance as cost-effectively as possible.
<P>
Privately held, Racore's corporate sales and marketing headquarters
are located in Los Gatos, California, with its design, development,
and operations facilities in Salt Lake City, Utah. European operations
are based in Cambridge, United Kingdom.
<H3>Customers and Distribution Channels</H3>

<P>
Racore's products serve a virtual &quot;who's who&quot; of industria1,
financial, and telecommunications companies, worldwide. A few
examples of end users standardizing their mission-critical networks
on Racore LANs include: one of the world's most extensive travel
reservations systems, North America's largest commercial banks,
and the top telephone service provider in Canada. Racore products
are also widely used at universities, military installations,
and in agencies at all levels of government.
<P>
Racore markets its &quot;off-the-shelf&quot; products through
a broad international network of distributors, value added resellers,
and systems integrators who sell, install, and support the full
product range.
<P>
Additionally, Racore has established key business alliances with
major multinational companies in the computing and data communications
industries for which Racore produces private label and custom
designed networking products and technologies on an OEM basis.
Racore's partners include the biggest names in bridges, routers,
PC workstations, and other key LAN elements. For instance, Texas
Instruments, one of the leading Token-Ring semiconductor suppliers,
offers Racore software with their chipsets through a cooperative
agreement between the two companies.
<H3>History</H3>

<P>
Racore was founded in 1983 with the mission to create innovative
products to enhance the performance of the emerging PC. Quick
to recognize the benefits of interconnecting PCs, the company
introduced its first networking product, LANpac, prior to the
advent of TokenRing standards. The LANpac product line, operating
at 16 Mbps, was the world's fastest and most economical connectivity
product for Novell networks. LANpac continues to enjoy market
acceptance today, with an continually expanding installed base.
<P>
A pioneer in the LAN arena in the 1980s, Racore helped define
Token-Ring as a member of the IEEE 802.5/802.2 committees. The
company was one of the first to deliver TokenRing adapters conforming
to this new standard, while offering significantly better performance
and more economical prices than IBM or other suppliers of compatible
products. Racore has consistently received superior ratings.
<P>
In 1990, Racore was once again at the forefront of the industry
as one of the first companies to ship products incorporating the
newly defined 16 Mbps Token-Ring standard. The following year
Racore again demonstrated technology leadership with the introduction
of a series of adapters based on the 802.5j Fiber Optic TokenRing
specification, as well as the first <I>diial</I><I>protocol </I>adapter,
which combines both TokenRing and Ethernet.
<P>
During the early 1990s, Racore's business base expanded significantly
with several additional major OEM contracts. During the same period,
compatibility certifications were obtained from Microsoft, Novell,
and the Token-Ring Interoperability Lab (TRIL). Racore was the
first major supplier to announce a standard lifetime warranty
for adapter products.
<P>
Most recently, Racore enhanced its family of adapters with the
introduction of its exceptionally high performance <I>ServerAccelerator
Series, </I>designed specifically to increase throughput in client/server
and multimedia applications. The company also expanded its product
line to include a selection of MAUS, repeaters, and other physical
layer network elements, offering a degree of systems integration
to its customers.
<H3>The People</H3>

<P>
Racore's employees maintain their high standards of quality under
the leadership of a dynamic team which directs the company's business
with a focus on perfor7nance-enhancing innovation in the LAN arena.
<P>
The senior management team is comprised of a group of seasoned
professionals averaging over 25 years of experience in the global
information technology and communications industries.
<H3>Product Summary</H3>

<P>
Racore is best known for its extensive line of Token-Ring adapters,
the most complete in the industry. The company offers a model
to suit virtually every application, ranging from lowcost workstation
connectivity, to super high throughput EISA server attachment.
All IBMcompatible bus architectures are supported, as are all
cabling media types, includingcopper shielded and unshielded twisted
pair and fiber Optic.
<P>

<P>
In addition to its adapter line, Racore offers a full complement
of physical layer products including MAUS, jitter Attenuators,
and Repeaters. These products enable customers to build completely
integrated, standards-based network solutions from a single supplier.
<P>

<H3>FAST ETHERNET LAN PROPOSAL</H3>
<HR>

<P>
<B>For Release February 21, 1994</B>
<H3>Company Joins AT&amp;T, HP, IBM, and Others to Support New
LAN Standard to Deliver 100 Mbit/s Performance to the Desktop
<B></B></H3>

<P>
Los Gatos, Calif., February 21, 1994 - Racore Computer Products,
Inc., a leading supplier of Token-Ring network products, joins
AT&amp;T Microelectronics, HewlettPackard, and other industry
leaders in supporting the emerging 10OVG-AnyLAN high speed standard.
Racore joins other AnyLAN supporters in a group formed to accelerate
the development of 10OVG-AnyLAN products. The AnyLAN standard
is designed to allow compliant products to be fully interoperable,
as wen as being compatible with the ftarne formats used in today's
Token-Ring and Ethernet networks. Other supporters of the proposed
standard include IBM, Ungermann-Bass, and other players in the
Token-Ring and Ethernet LAN markets.
<P>
Racore will incorporate the new 10OVG-AnyLAN technology into its
product line later this year with the introduction of a family
of network adapters.
<P>
&quot;Racore has large customers actively developing applications
that will require far more network capacity to the desktop than
their LANs can presently handle. These users will benefit from
the economical migration path to 100 Mbit/s on-demand performance
that AnyLAN offers,&quot; said John LaPorta, Racore president
and CEO.
<P>
The AnyLAN standard is currently being drafted by the 802.12 working
group of the IEEE committee. As an active participant in the IEEE
committee, Racore will support the proposal through all steps
of the standards process.
<P>
The 100VG-AnyLAN Demand Priority Access Protocol will facilitate
the transmission of data, voice, and video at 100 Mbit/s over
the same Category 3 unshielded twisted-pair and other copper and
fiber optic cable types used in installed Token-Ring and Ethernet
networks. Preserving the existing network topology will enable
cost-effective implementation of traffic-intensive applications,
such as multimedia, which require higher bandwidth than is currently
available.
<P>
For over a decade, Racore has focused on providing high-performance
LAN solutions. The company's LANpac product line was the world's
first 16 Nfbit/s LAN solution for Novell NetWare connectivity.
Racore subsequently contributed to the IEEE 802.5 and 802.5(j)
standards for 16 Mbit/s Token-Ring and became one of the first
companies to deliver products conforming to those specifications
for both twisted pair and fiber optic networks.
<P>
Racore designs, develops, manufactures, and markets a full line
of Local Area Network products, specializing in Token-Ring. Racore's
products are available through an extensive international network
of distributors, value added resellers, and systems integrators.
In addition, Racore produces private label and custom-designed
products and technologies through key business alliances with
major multinational networking and computing companies.
<P>
Founded in 1983, Racore is privately held. Its corporate offices
are located in Los Gatos, California, with facilities in Salt
Lake City, Utah, and Cambridge, United Kingdom.

<P>
<B>For Release October 25</B>
<P>
<B>New Server Token-Ring Interface Cards Relieve Bottleneck, Provide
Increased Throughput Needed to Support Workgroup Users </B>
<P>
<B>Los Gatos, Calif., October 25, 1993 - </B>Racore Computer Products,
Inc. today introduced a new family of exceptionally high-performance
network adapters designed to support the special demands of chent/server
and multimedia applications. These applications greatly increase
the amount of traffic a server must manage. Racore is a leading
supplier of Token-Ring network products.
<P>
Racore's Server Accelerator Series increases throughput by offering
special server adapters that significantly improve end-to-end
network response by relieving a major bottleneck at the server's
network interface.
<P>
&quot;Chent/server computing is a welcome application strategy
for users and software designers, but it is creating headaches
for the network administrator,&quot; said John LaPorta, Racore
president and CEO. &quot;Our Server Accelerator Series is a costeffective
solution that allows servers to keep pace with the ever increasing
demands being placed on them.&quot;
<P>
Racore's Server Accelerator Series' performance breakthrough is
achieved by a hardware implementation of functions that are normally
provided by much slower adapter software. The company used a new
IC from Texas Instruments in the design. Measured network throughput
has been doubled in systems using Racore Server Accelerators.
They can transmit and receive more than 25,000 packets per second
to support the high volume of network traffic that is prevalent
in client/server and multimedia applications.
<P>
&quot;The new Racore cards are without a doubt the fastest we
have tested,&quot; said Corey D. Schou, Chairman of Idaho State
University's Computer Information Systems. Idaho employs i486
servers to support an advanced group decision support application,
a single session of which can have 64 users each accessing the
network four times per second for up to twelve hours. Each access
can result in the transmission of 25 4,000-byte packets. Professor
Schou added, &quot;the installation of Racore's Server Accelerator
Series has enabled us to provide significantly improved performance
to the faculty and students of the College of Business.&quot;
<P>
Network administrators will appreciate how easy and inexpensive
it is to upgrade to the Server Accelerator Series. Adapters displaced
from the server can be reused in new clients as they are added
to the network.
<P>
&quot;The Server Accelerators represent a logical complement to
our existing line of high performance Token-Ring adapters,&quot;
LaPorta added.
<P>
&quot;Racore understands Token-Ring networking. We have worked
very closely with Racore to develop the T12000 software driver
suite which we distribute with our TMS380 chipset,&quot; said
Joe Valente, TI's LAN program manager. We are pleased to see that
they are one of the first companies to deliver products based
on our new PacketBlaster technology.&quot;
<P>
The Server Accelerator Series comes in six configurations, supporting
ISA, MCA, and EISA PC bus architectures with a choice of two media
interface options shielded plus unshielded twisted pair; or shielded
twisted pair plus fiber optic. Standard features on all models
include 512KB of RAM, Remote Program Load (RPL), 802.2 LLC (for
IBM host connectivity, and diagnostics stored in Flash ROM. Selfconfiguring
software drivers are included for all major network operating
system environirnents.
<P>
The Server Accelerator Series adapters are available immediately
and are priced from $745 U.S. fist ($641 in 10-packs).
<P>
Racore designs, develops, manufactures, and markets a full line
of Local Area Network products, specializing in Token-Ring. Racore's
products are available through an extensive international network
of distributors, value added resellers, and systems integrators.
In addition, Racore produces private label and custom-designed
products and technologies through key business alliances with
major networking and computing companies worldwide.

For more than 200 years the medical profession has been aware of an illness characterised by extreme tiredness and aching muscles.
<P>
Victorian terms, such as 'the vapours' or neurasthenia, have been applied to what is now popularly called myalgic encephalomyelitis, or ME. 
<P>
Although debate has raged over whether ME really exists, the Department of Health recognised it as a ''debilitating and distressing condition'' in 1991. The World Health Organisation has classified it as a disease of the nervous system. 
<P>
A recent report from the Royal Colleges of Physicians, Psychiatrists and General Practitioners, published in October, argues that the term 'ME' be abandoned in favour of CFS, adopted in 1988, ''which is accurate and free from unproven aetiological claims''.
<P>
The name ME indicates symptoms of muscle pain (myalgic) with inflammation of the brain and spinal cord (encephalomyelitis). Although the Royal Colleges' report recognises that 'ME' emphasises the physiological aspects of the condition, the inclusion of the term 'encephalomyelitis' ''erroneously endorses the existence of a specific pathological process for which, in the context, there is no evidence''.
<P>
However, by choosing the term Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS), it should be remembered that chronic fatigue, in general, is seen as a symptom with incidences of between 20 and 30 per cent in the community. Concern has been expressed that 'CFS' could underestimate the severity of the condition, but the report's authors suggest that the term can cover ''a spectrum of severity''.
<P>
<H3>Symptoms</H3>
The image of sufferers of ME tends to be that of the young adult with a certain degree of affluence ('Yuppie flu'), but it can develop at any age, regardless of social status.
<P>
There are estimated to be between 150,000 and 200,000 sufferers in the UK, or between 1 and 2 per cent in primary care. The majority of diagnosed cases of CFS occur in white women. Patients tend to be between 25 and 45-years-old. However, diagnosis may reflect differences in culture and factors such as access to medical care.
<P>
An important criterion for diagnosis of CFS is that symptoms should be chronic, and have lasted six months or longer.
The main symptoms are characterised by a disabling, exercise-induced muscle fatigue, myalgia, often a severe flu-like malaise, an abnormal exhaustion unrelieved by sleep, and various mental and sensory symptoms.
<P>
These include loss of concentration and short-term memory, dyslexia, nausea, ataxia, light and noise sensitivities, and depressive symptoms. Bladder control and bowel disturbance may also result.
<P>
Patients may complain they cannot move for the pain and are not able to sleep properly. Some days the pain can be so severe that even lying in bed is too painful. Body temperature may also fluctuate.
<P>
Depression may develop as a reaction to other symptoms rather than as a primary symptom, but is seen in up to 80 per cent of patients.
<P>
It is difficult to advise on the prognosis. For some, the illness can improve, with full health returning in time. For others, it can get progressively worse. Often, the illness follows a cyclical course, alternating between periods of illness and relatively good health. Others may improve but not return to full health.
<P>
<H3>Causes</H3>
The real causes of CFS are unknown, but viral infection, either as a cause or a trigger, and chemicals have been implicated. A disturbance in serotonin levels has been established, especially in relation to receptors in the hypothalamus.
<P>
Genetic make-up and environmental factors may play a significant part in whether a person develops CFS. Other theories include endocrine disturbances, poor blood absorption in the brain stem, reduced cranial blood flow, or a chronically-activated immune system (upregulation), brought about by infection, stress or other transient traumatic conditions.
<P>
In many patients, it is possible to identify elevated titres of antibodies to viral and bacterial infection, such as herpes, Epstein Barr Virus, cytomegalovirus, rubella, enteroviruses and Borrelia (Lyme disease). However, serological testing cannot be used for diagnosing CFS, as there is significant overlap with control subjects. Glandular fever has been believed to develop into ME if not treated appropriately.
<P>
Some believe that CFS can be caught, as there have been cases in which more than one member of the family is affected. The current thinking is that it is unlikely that CFS is communicable, either by casual or intimate contact in humans, or that animals are involved in its transmission.
<P>
However, patient clusters may indicate that there has been exposure to a common causative agent or carrier. US research indicates that if CFS or its causative agent is infectious, then sufferers become less infectious or non-infectious after the first year. However, the majority of cases occur in single members of family groups. 
<P>
The Royal Colleges' report says CFS should be regarded as being multifactorial in origin. Evidence for viral infections as risk factors in CFS are limited to the fatigue syndrome following 10 per cent of EBV infections.
<P>
A report to be published this month implicates organophosphates (OPs). Professor Peter Behan of Glasgow University says tests on animals and humans show the same abnormal pattern in brain hormone levels in both patients poisoned by OPs and those suffering from CFS.
<P>
Of particular concern is the use of OPs found in house-hold insecticides such as dichlorvos and malathion. OPs are also being implicated in Gulf War Syndrome, another illness characterised by chronic fatigue and myalgia. 
<P>
Persons with allergies may show some predisposition to CFS, but many sufferers are allergy-free. Symptoms may fluctuate with the monthly hormonal cycle in women sufferers.
<P>
<H3>Treatment</H3>
Without knowing the cause of CFS, it is difficult to identify effective treatments. The old adage that the greater the number of remedies the less likely there is a cure seems to hold good in this case. 
<P>
Several methods of treating CFS have been tried using drugs and non-drug therapies, such as cognitive behaviour therapy and psychotherapy. A review concluded that ''although there had been reports in limited numbers of patients claiming benefit for various treatments, none had consistently proved to be effective''.
<P>
Drug therapy tends to be for symptomatic relief. It has included antidepressants, due to the high incidence of depressive symptoms in CFS sufferers, as well as immunoglobulins (Igs) and evening primrose oil with marine fish oil. PolyI poly C is also being studied.
<P>
However, the Royal Colleges say: ''The list of treatments for which therapeutic claims are made in the context of CFS is a source of concern. There is no systematic evidence supporting any drug regime for CFS.''
<P>
Antidepressants that have been studied with reference to CFS include fluoxetine, phenelzine and moclobemide. Other antidepressants used include prothiaden and sertraline.
<P>
Evening primrose oil has been cited because it contains the essential fatty acid (EFA), gammalinolenic acid. Viral infections can deplete the body's supply of EFA. A controlled study looked at evening primrose and marine fish oil in a ratio of 4:1 given in a capsule (Efamol Marine), with liquid paraffin as the placebo. 
<P>
Almost three-quarters of those taking the EFA combination in the trial rated themselves better compared to only 17 per cent in the control. It may be that EFAs inhibit viral replication of viruses, which acquire their lipid envelope from the host cell membranes. EFAs may also promote the action of interferon.
<P>
Magnesium deficiency was linked to CFS in one study, but this has not been confirmed by others. It seems unlikely that dietary magnesium deficiency can be a cause when the average diet contains a third more than the recommended daily amount of 300mg.
<P>
Another study reported improvements in patients given magnesium injections over six weeks. However, magnesium therapy is not widely supported as there is still insufficient evidence.
<P>
Folic acid was found to be deficient in 50 per cent of patients in one study, but there is little evidence to suggest other vitamin deficiencies are involved
<P>.
Immunotherapy may be of use, but it is not clear whether immunostimulants or immunosuppressants would be more effective. The upregulation theory would support the latter, but if the CFS is being caused by an infective agent, then immunoglobulins may be of use. Trials of Igs have not been conclusive, but some doctors will prescribe intramuscular injections of Igs. Steroids, such as prednisolone, to control upregulation or to increase depleted blood levels of cortisol are discouraged.
<P>
The Royal Colleges see no role for Igs, antihistamines or other immunostimulants, saying: ''There is no compelling evidence linking immune dysfunction with disability.'' They would prefer immunotherapy to be given only as part of controlled clinical trials.
However, they are supportive of treating depression and anxiety in CFS patients.
<P>
Other drug therapies in which there is anecdotal evidence of benefit include calcium antagonists in severe myalgia and antivirals.
CFS symptoms can worsen after exercise or other activity. The severe pain that may develop two to three days after exercise deters patients from doing any more.
<P>
<H3>To exercise or not?</H3>
The benefits of exercise in stimulating muscle mass have to be balanced with the increase in metabolites within the muscle which cause the myalgia after exercise. Ultimately, the psychological effects dissuade the patient from any activity and lead to prolonged periods of inactivity.
<P>
Patients may, therefore, benefit from a programme in which there is gentle exercise without the need for prolonged rest, avoiding extremes in both activity and inactivity. Although the activity may cause some pain, the patient can expect it to be transient rather than prolonged, as would follow more extreme activity. This forms the basis of cognitive behavioural therapy in which the patient recognises why the pain develops and alters their expectations of the disease and their behaviour.
<P>
Complementary therapies have included acupuncture, homoeopathy, herbal treatment or metabolic therapy. Soft tissue massage, reflexology or aromatherapy may be of benefit.
<P>
Above all, the patient will respond to an empathic approach. Any doubts that the illness is all in the mind should be discarded, as for them the illness is very real. Use the term for the illness the patient uses  CFS for some patients is too vague, but ME is a 'real' illness.
<P>
Bear in mind the medica-tion they may be taking, such as anti-depressants, if asked to counter prescribe. As there is no specific 'cure', be supportive if the patient wants to try alternative therapies. By doing this, the patient may gain a more positive attitude to treating the illness.
<P>
CFS in children should be approached in a similar way to adults. However, the situation can be more emotive with the social and family concerns involved.

<BODY>
<br><br>


Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a shorthand term for symptoms of intestinal dysfunction whose cause is unknown but unlikely to be organic. However, the scale of the problem is huge, affecting up to a quarter of the population and accounting for around 40 per cent of referrals to gastroenterologists.
<P>
Its psychological and social impact was highlighted earlier  this year. A survey of 2,500 sufferers published during 
IBS Awareness Week in June revealed that almost three-quarters of respondents believed IBS had a negative effect on their lives. Over half said they had to cancel social engagements as a result of an attack and nearly a third said it had a negative impact on relationships at home.
<P>
That said, community pharmacists are the health professionals most likely to come across many of these patients. Although many are managed by their GPs, it is estimated that for every patient who consults, another two do not.
<P>
<H3>Presentation</H3>
IBS can be a very distressing combination of intermittent abdominal pain and irregular bowel habits, such as alternating diarrhoea and constipation. It occurs when the normal involuntary muscular contractions, which move the bowel contents smoothly through the intestines, become strong and irregular.
<P>
It usually begins in early or middle adulthood. The group of people most commonly affected are those aged between 20 and 60 years, with most sufferers being women. Although symptoms subside and can disappear for long periods, they usually recur throughout life.
<P>
The most prevalent symptoms of IBS are:
<li>Colon spasticity: inevitably painful, often colicky in nature and can occur anywhere in the abdomen, although the iliac fossa is usually the primary site. Pain can be relieved by defecation, although it can be more severe after eating or at night.
<P>
<li>Altered bowel habit: may present as alternating constipation and diarrhoea. The latter may be watery and painless.
<P>
<li>Audible intestinal rumblings: or borborygmi, often associated with increased flatus or a distended abdomen. For sufferers, a small amount of wind may be more distressing and an excessive amount of belching may occur.
<P>
<li>Tenesmus: a feeling of incomplete emptying of the bowels after defecation. These symptoms often lead to patients being misdiagnosed as suffering from constipation or diarrhoea.
<P>
<li>Proctalgia fugax: a brief sharp pain felt low in the rectum which may be associated with further abdominal pain and colicky pain.
<P>
<H3>Diagnosis</H3>
Gastroenterologists use the internationally accepted Manning criteria for diagnosing IBS, which can be useful for other health professionals (see Box 1). 
<P>
Looking for possible causes (such as those outlined in Box 2) is also important as some of these can be treated. Such patients should be advised to consult their GP. 
<P>
Pain associated with IBS can have features which distinguish a functional origin from organic disease. Functional pain comes and goes. It can be felt in several different places, including some unusual areas, such as the subcostal regions, the loins, the back and the top of the thighs. On the other hand, pain from organic disease tends to be more localised and stereotyped.
<P>
There are other disorders which can overlap with IBS associations. These have also been suggested with other gastro-intestinal disorders, such as dyspepsia and constipation, as well as other disorders, like fibromyalgia, irritable bladder and chronic fatigue syndrome. Classical migraine tends to co-exist with IBS in both individuals and in families.
<P>
Patients who are able to date their IBS symptoms to an attack of traveller's diarrhoea or other ineffective diarrhoea are those who are most likely to recover completely. One of the most controversial areas of IBS is whether some cases are true cases of food intolerance. Psychological food aversion is much more common than true food intolerance and it has been difficult to prove that physical intolerances exist. Specifically, lactose intolerance has recently been disproved as a cause of IBS.
<P>
<H3>Options for treatment</H3>
Treatment for IBS is symptomatic as there is no cure. For many patients, an explanation of the origin of symptoms and a reassurance that it is not a serious condition will be enough to allow the patients to live with the symptoms. Emphasis on the fact there is no underlying pathology is extremely important.
<P>
<li>Fibre Pharmacists can advise patients to include more fibre in their diet or to take bulking agents, such as bran, ispaghula or sterculia, or synthetic alternatives, such as methycellulose. Many gastroenterologists recommend trying dietary manipulation before resorting to bulking agents.
<P>
<li>Anti-diarrhoeals Diarrhoea should be treated by using bulking agents, but a short course of an anti-diarrhoeal can be recommended for acute cases.
<P>
<li>Anti-spasmodics The most effective drugs for relieving the abdominal pain of IBS are the anti-spasmodics, which work by reducing the spasm of the muscles in the intestinal tract. These drugs can be divided into the anti-cholinergics and the direct-acting smooth muscle relaxants.
<P>
The anti-spasmodic action of anti-cholinergics is also used in the management of diverticular disease. They work by damping the transmission of nerve signals to the bowel wall, blocking the action of acetylcholine and relaxing the intestinal wall muscles. Their use is associated with a high incidence of cholinergic side-effects such as dry mouth and blurred vision. They are contra-indicated in glaucoma, prostate hypertrophy and intestinal obstruction. Dose titration is recommended in the elderly.
<P>
Buscopan (hyoscine butylbromide) and Kolanticon are indicated for IBS or gastro-intestinal spasm and have OTC licences. Merbentyl (dicyclomine hydrochloride) and Pro-banthine (propantheline bromide) are both POMs, but dicyclomine can be sold OTC provided the maximum single dose is 10mg and maximum daily dose is 60mg. Patients should be warned to use these products only on an 'as necessary' basis to avoid dependence. 
<P>
The direct-acting smooth muscle relaxants alverine citrate, mebeverine and peppermint oil are thought to have a direct local effect on the GI tract relieving spasm caused by IBS.
<P> 
Peppermint oil also has a carminative action to relieve pain caused by bloating but may cause heartburn. OTC products include Colpermin and Mintec. OTC preparations of alverine citrate include Spasmonal and Alercol (also contains sterculia). Fybogel Mebeverine is POM, as is mebeverine on it own (Colofac).
<P>
<H3>Non-drug therapy</H3>
Advising patients on self-help techniques is more time-consuming than dispensing a preparation, but many patients have benefited hugely from non-medical interventions.
<P>
Most patients respond to a careful explanation of their symptoms and the importance of self-help, which involves encouraging them to eat more healthily. Lifestyle changes, including taking regular physical exercise, yoga, t'ai chi or meditation, help some people cope with IBS related to stress.
<P>
Physical exercise has a direct effect on intestinal motility and may help to reduce constipation and abdominal distension, as well as to therapeutically reduce anxiety (see Box 4).
<P>
<H3>Latest research</H3>
There is increasing evidence that the basic problem in functional gastro-intestinal disorders is a heightened sensitivity of the gut rather than motility disorders. This is thought to be the case for a range of problems from heartburn to dyspepsia through to irritable bowel.
<P>
Although a clear understanding of the pathogenesis is some way off, signals from the gut penetrate the consciousness more readily in patients with these problems - either because of a fault in gut wall sensory receptors or in the synapses in the afferent pathways. The problem could also lie in the higher centres. 
<P>
<H3>Self-help groups</H3>

Acne vulgaris is the most common form of acne, but it is important to be able to distinguish it from the lesser-known types discussed below.
<P>
The major cause of acne vulgaris is the increased sex hormone production at puberty, although acne can continue into middle age. Hormonal changes in the female cycle may provoke an acne attack, which is most pronounced just before menstruation. Despite anecdotal stories, diet is not thought to be implicated in the condition. Other causes are listed in Box 1.
<P>
<li><STRONG> Acne keloidalis</STRONG> This is a common form found in people with strong, tightly-curled hair, particularly Afro-Caribbean men. The direction of hair growth frequently results in their penetrating the follicular wall. This leads to blockage of the follicle preventing normal sebum flow to the surface and the formation of a fibrous tissue in the dermis with concurrent inflammation. The area often becomes infected and thus shows typical acne symptoms. 
<P>
Treatment includes keeping the area clean, using topical and/or systemic antibiotics and removing offending hairs.
<P>
<li> <STRONG>Acne rosacea</STRONG> This is not true acne but a chronic inflammatory disorder, which is characterised by diffuse erythema of the face, sometimes accompanied by papules and pustules, the presence of which links it to acne. 
<P>
The cause is obscure but may be related to vascular damage from ultraviolet or infrared radiation, release of inflammatory chemicals in the skin, or even a mite. The flushing is exacerbated by hot drinks, alcohol, emotional stress, exposure to UV or IR radiation and certain drugs. Treatment primarily involves long-term antibiotics, low-potency topical steroids and, for the pustules, benzoyl peroxide.
<P>
<H3>Incidence </H3>
Being sex hormone-related, the initial appearance of acne vulgaris starts with the onset of puberty and gradually subsides with age. The Proprietary Association of Great Britain's survey in 1988 found that 35 per cent of males and 41 per cent of females aged between 15 and 19 had acne symptoms in a two-week period. It is a common problem and the pharmacy is often the first, and sometimes only, port of call.
<P>
<H3>Pathophysiology</H3>
Sebaceous glands produce sebum, an oily material, which lubricates and maintains hydration of the skin and hair. The two main factors which result in acne are increased sebum secretion and blocking of the sebaceous duct. Both of these are influenced by hormone levels. 
<P>
At puberty there is increased androgen production in both sexes, which leads to increase in the size and activity of the sebaceous gland, with larger amounts of sebum being produced. At the same time, increased adrenal glucocorticoid production encourages hyperkeratinisation of the follicular wall. Both these factors encourage blocking of the duct by a sebum 'plug' which results in acne.
<P>
It should be noted that acne sufferers do not have higher levels of these hormones than non-sufferers: it is postulated that the target organs are more sensitive to stimulation.
<P>
The plug is a 'whitehead'. If is reaches the surface, it collects melanin pigment and gives rise to 'blackheads' - the black colour is not the result of dirt collection or oxidation of sebum.
<P>
Infection of blocked ducts is common and leads to pustular acne. The most common infective agents are propionibacterium acnes and various staphylococci, both commensals of skin. An inflammatory reaction follows which, together with blocking of the duct, frequently causes permanent damage to the duct and potential visible pitting or scarring.
<P>
<H3>Patient presentation</H3>
The presentation of acne by patients is usually not challenging. Either the patient or their mother (less common nowadays) asks for advice as to which is the best product for 'spots'. However, as the onset coincides with the period of sexual self-awareness, there is always some degree of emotional and psychological involvement, which necessitates a considerable degree of tact in handling the patient.

<li> Questions to ask
How long have you had acne?<br>
Is it infected (pustular)?<br>
Are you taking any medicine?<br>
Do you use cosmetics?<br>
What have you tried?<br>
Is it restricted to the face, back and chest?<br>
<P>
<H3>Diagnosis</H3>
<li>Symptom complex Whiteheads, blackheads and pustules are the characteristic signs of acne. The skin in the area of the eruptions is frequently greasy.
<li> <STRONG>Region</STRONG> Acne vulgaris is specifically found only on the face, back and chest. The pathophysiology indicates that the sebaceous gland is involved and this is sited within a hair follicle. If there is strong hair growth, acne will not occur at that site: the fast and strong growing hair keeps the duct free of excess sebum. Hence, acne is not found on the scalp of the average patient, occurring more commonly where there is fine or no hair growth (face, back and chest). 
<li> <STRONG>Universal factors</STRONG> Provoking factors: onset is associated with puberty and in females the condition may be worse during the second half of the cycle. Hot, humid conditions may exacerbate the condition as may covering the skin with thick, greasy cosmetics.
<P> 
Relieving factors: as the patient moves out of their teens, the condition frequently resolves spontaneously but many patients may suffer into their 20s and even beyond. 

<li><STRONG>Time/intensity</STRONG> Pharmacists must ensure that serious cases are referred early enough to ensure scarring and pitting does not become a problem. 
<li><STRONG>Natural history</STRONG> Onset is normally insidious and the condition is rarely constant in intensity, with acute attack followed by clear skin. It may flare up due to stress and this should be taken into account.
V <STRONG>Your current medication</STRONG> For females the contraceptive Pill may be implicated. Consideration should be given to the drugs listed in Box 1. Selenium-containing shampoos (for dandruff) should be avoided.
<P>
<H3>Management</H3>
The diagnosis of acne is relatively straightforward and, in general, pharmacists will be able to recommend suitable initial treatment. Treatment decisions will be influenced by various factors, which are disclosed during application of the CARE mnemonic.
<li><STRONG> Chronic/risk group/age</STRONG> As pharmacist-recommended treatments are topical, there are very few classes of patients who cannot be treated. However, all infants and children below the age of puberty should be referred and caution should be exercised for diabetic patients in view of potential problems due to poor micro circulation. If the condition is seen in patients who are more than 40 years old and the acne is not an isolated outbreak of a few spots, referral is necessary.
<li> <STRONG>Allergies </STRONG>Before recommending external preparations, it is important to ensure there are no pre-existing allergies to the product.
<li> <STRONG>Reaction of proposed medication</STRONG> One of the major agents used to treat acne is benzoyl peroxide (see below) and reaction to this chemical is well established. Thus, caution should be exercised.
<li> <STRONG>Establish patient preference</STRONG> A wide range of formulations to treat acne are available and patients frequently have individual preferences as to whether they favour a cream, a wash, gels or masks. 
<P>
<H3>Product selection</H3>
One major factor in the control of acne is ensuring the sebaceous ducts and final skin pores are free of obstruction. This can be encouraged by deep cleansing the skin regularly to prevent clogging in the first place, or by drug treatment.
<P>
A realistic time frame for healing should also be made clear to the patient - get them  to think in terms of three to six months. Some experts have the two-month rule: try washes for two months and if these fail move on to local applications and/or antibiotics for two months. If no improvement is seen, try an alternative antibiotic for a further two months. If this also fails, refer to a skin specialist.
<P>
Pharmacists ought to be aware of this rule and also the potential permanent damage acne can do. Assuming the patient presents with a few spots (mild acne), they should recommend washes and treatments discussed below. However, if the acne is severe or does not respond to simple treatment, they must refer the patient to the general practitioner: it is not a waste of the doctor's time.
Antiproliferative agents, drugs which reduce sebum production, antibiotics (as antibacterials), anti-androgens and corticosteroids are available on prescription, some to be prescribed only by dermatological consultants.
<P>
The major agents present in OTC acne products are kerolytics and antimicrobials, some of which also contain abrasives.
<P>
<STRONG>a) Kerolytic agents</STRONG> Benzoyl peroxide is one of the most effective kerolytic agents available OTC and has mild antibacterial action. It reduces the breakdown of sebum into irritant fatty acids, induces peeling of the skin and encourages comedone removal. It also has a direct bactericidal action on propionibacterium acnes, one of the prime causative bacteria of acne pustule infection.
<P>
Benzoyl peroxide is available in various concentrations from 2.5 to 10 per cent. Patients must be warned that it commonly causes initial irritation with reddening and soreness at the site. The skin rapidly adapts to the chemical and subsequent applications cause no problems. Because of this initial effect, it is advisable to begin treatment with the lower 2.5 per cent concentration product, working up to the 10 per cent strength if required. 
<P>
As oxygen is released from benzoyl peroxide when it comes into contact with the skin, it may act as a bleaching agent both on clothing, skin and hair. 
<P>
Salicylic acid, resorcinol and sulphur are kerolytics of long standing and are present in some acne products. Their use has decreased with time and there is little evidence that they increase efficacy when combined with benzoyl peroxide. 

<STRONG>b) Topical antibacterials</STRONG> The rationale for the use of antibacterial agents in topical OTC acne products is that they may decrease the bacterial count on the skin, reducing the possibility of blocked pore infection. 
<P>
Many such agents are surfactants and their prime mode of action is to reduce surface sebum and aid the removal of 'debris' from the skin, thus reducing comedone formation. This also accounts for many acne lotions containing various alcohols (both as antibacterials and degreasing agents). The use of such combination products to wash appears both sensible and useful.
<P>
<STRONG>Non-drug therapy</STRONG>
The expression 'cleanliness is next to godliness' is especially applicable to acne sufferers. Primary advice should be centred on this aspect of treatment as removal of excess sebum is the mainstay of non-drug treatment. Washing once or twice a day with a detergent is recommended. 
<P>
The use of mild abrasives, both in cream form and as cleansing pads, is useful but care must be taken not to overuse these. Scrubbing and excessive massage may increase sebum production and damage the skin surface.
<P>
A second significant consideration should be to address the psychological state of the patient. It is important not to deride the sufferer's view of their appearance but worthwhile to try to put it in perspective. They should be assured that complete healing occurs in most cases, although rapid improvement should not be expected.
<P>
Covering unsightly blemishes is common for the sensitive teenager but should be discouraged. However, banning cosmetics is unrealistic: instead, suggest occasional rather than continuous use.
<P>
Although diet (chocolate, fatty foods, 'convenience' foods) is frequently cited as a contributory factor in acne, there is no convincing scientific evidence to substantiate this.

Acute low back pain not only causes considerable suffering and disability but also costs this country millions of pounds in terms of lost working days. The treatment of the condition is an important issue to both patients and healthcare professionals.
<P>
This article aims to review the clinical guidelines on the management of acute low back pain and to show how we pharmacists can audit, whether we are following the guidelines and whether we are referring appropriately.
<P>
<H3>Guidelines</H3>
In July last year, the NHS Executive commissioned the Royal College of General Practitioners to develop evidence-based clinical guidelines for the management of acute low back pain. The guidelines were to be based on a review of all the latest evidence on the best ways of managing this condition. The RCGP worked in collaboration with four other bodies  the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy, the Osteopathic Association of Great Britain, the British Chiropractic Association and the National Back Pain Association. 
<P>
After an extensive review of the literature, a draft set of guidelines were produced which were then subjected to formal reviews by a wide range of professionals and organisations (including the RPSGB). The resulting clinical guidelines represent the most up to date evidence and recommendations on management.
<P>
<H3>Pharmacist input</H3>
Community pharmacists are often the first port of call for patients wishing to treat themselves. Part of our role is to assess the patient and decide whether they need to see their GP or if it is safe and appropriate for them to self-treat. The RCGP guidelines include an initial assessment of the patient to rule out more serious problems, together with suggestions on drug therapy (most of which are available over the counter) and advice to patients. The community pharmacist is in a good position to carry out these roles. However, it is important that we ensure that we are following best practice and that our advice coincides with that given by other local healthcare professionals.
<P>
<H3>Potential problems</H3>
The majority of cases of low back pain that a community pharmacist sees will be simple backache. However, it is important that community pharmacists are able to spot potential problems and refer them on to the GP as soon as possible. The use of simple questioning techniques, such as the WWHAM questions, will enable the pharmacist to exclude potential serious diagnoses.
At the end of your questioning of a patient presenting with symptoms of acute low back pain, you should know: 
<P>
<li>the approximate age of the patient
<li>where the pain is
<li>the cause and nature of the pain
<li>any medical history
<li>medication being taken
<li>whether the patient is unwell
<li>any signs of neurological problems, such as numbness, tingling.
<P>
If any potential serious symptoms are noticed or there is any doubt about the diagnosis, the patient should be referred to their GP. In doing this, it is important not to worry the patient, while at the same time ensuring that your advice is followed.
<P>
Once serious problems are excluded, the patient can be reassured that there is nothing to worry about and that backache is very common. Research into the guidelines showed that psychosocial factors were important in the patient's response to treatment: what the patient believes about back pain and their attitude to coping with the pain and rehabilitation are important factors in their recovery. The RCGP guidelines listed some of the key points to get over to the patient when offering advice. The key patient information points are listed in Box 3.
<P>
<H3>Drug therapy</H3>
The suggested drug therapy is simple analgesic at regular intervals. The guidelines suggest that paracetamol is used initially and if that is inadequate to try non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen. If these are not sufficient, then combined paracetamol and weak opioid compounds, such as co-dydramol or co-proxamol, can be tried. The drug recommended by the pharmacist will depend on what the patient has already tried and the severity of the pain. It is also worth suggesting the local application of heat or cold which may provide temporary relief of pain, although it has no long-term effect on the outcome.
<P>
<H3>Audit of guidelines</H3>
All too often in primary care, healthcare professionals find themselves working along similar but slightly different lines. This is confusing for patients and undermines their confidence in the primary healthcare team. A patient with acute low back pain may initially see any one of a number of healthcare professionals depending on how much they know about their condition and who they think can best help them.
<P>
Some patients will decide that they can treat themselves with painkillers and present at the pharmacy; others will decide that they need to see a chiropractor, osteopath or physiotherapist to sort out back problems. Other patients will think that they need to see their GP and get a prescription or a referral to a specialist. It should not matter who they go and see initially, as each patient should receive the same advice and the most appropriate treatment.
<P>
In order to check whether we are all acting as a team, we should agree local guidelines and audit whether we are all following them. This would mean meeting with our local GPs, osteopaths, chiropractors and physiotherapists to agree what the local treatment guidelines and referral procedures should be. 
<P>
Local guidelines should be based on the national guidelines and should clearly determine when a patient should be referred from one professional to another. This process may be done at a local practice level or at a health authority level through local representative committees like the local pharmaceutical committee.
<P>
An audit can look at different aspects of the guidelines, such as the initial assessment, what advice is given and the referrals between professionals. The following cases are two examples of how an audit can be carried out.
<P>
<STRONG>1 Audit of initial assessment</STRONG> The diagnostic triage will decide which patients need referring to a GP and which can safely self-treat (Box 2).
<P>
An audit of diagnostic triage would look at whether sufficient information was obtained from the patient to exclude potential serious diagnoses. It is best to concentrate on what information is obtained from the patient rather than the questions asked.
<P>
The results will give a picture of what you and your staff are doing for patients with low back pain and whether sufficient information is being obtained from the patient to ensure a safe diagnosis.
<P>
The form may be used as a simple tick sheet to show that the information established is suggestive of simple backache. Any symptoms which suggest any other diagnosis should be noted on the form separately. The outcome can be coded according to the following codes:
<P>
A Analgesic given
D Advice given
G Referred to GP
O Referred to osteopath
C Referred to chiropractor
P Referred to physiotherapist 
<P>
<STRONG>2 Audit of referrals</STRONG> It is equally important to ensure that any referrals made are helpful and not just wasting time for a colleague. It is possible to follow up any referrals made, so long as a formal referral note is used, such as the one produced by the National Pharmaceutical Association. If this is used, a simple form can be attached to the referral note for the GP to give you feedback.
<P>
Any audit of this nature should be multi-disciplinary with each professional looking at his or her own practice and sharing the results, so that everyone involved learns from the process. Similar audits of both the initial assessment and referrals can be conducted by each profession.

<BODY>
<br><br>
Malaria continues to pose a serious risk to the health of the traveller and it is essential that anyone involved in giving travel health advice is aware of the changing risks from this deadly disease.
<P>There are more than 100 million cases of malaria every year worldwide, resulting in over a million deaths. In the UK, more than 2,000 cases of malaria are imported each year, including a growing number of cases of the potentially fatal<EM> falciparum</EM> strain.
The world malaria situation has deteriorated over the past 20 years as the<EM> falciparum</EM> parasite developed widespread resistance. <P>We have relatively few drugs in our armoury to fight this disease and, combined with the growing resistance of the host mosquito to insecticides and an increase in the number of potential breeding sites, it has become a serious problem.
<P>During the same period, the holidaymaker has been forsaking traditional Mediterranean destinations for more exotic and often malarious holiday spots.
<P>Most of those who died of malaria recently had taken inadequate or no chemoprophylaxis, though some deaths can be accounted for by delay in diagnosis.
<P>So far this year there has been a significant rise in the number of cases of malaria compared with 1995. This is worrying and could be due to two significant factors. First, the NHS subsidy was withdrawn from antimalarial drugs last year, which may have led travellers to simply 'risk it' and do without. Second, recent media scares about antimalarial drug side-effects may have damaged compliance particularly with Mefloquine, the newest and now widely recommended chemoprophylactic.
<P>
<br><H3>What is malaria?</H3>
<P>Malaria is a parasitic disease caused by a protozoan from the genus<EM> Plasmodium</EM> of which there are four human species: <EM>P falciparum</EM>,<EM> P vivax</EM>, <EM>P ovale</EM> and <EM>P malariae</EM>.
<P>The organism splits its lifecycle between the human host and the female anopheles mosquito which feeds on blood. Malaria transmission occurs when a female mosquito inoculates sporozoites from its salivary gland into the human bloodstream. Within 30 minutes, the sporozoites travel to the liver and develop into hepatocytes inside liver cells. Seven to ten days later, new forms of merozoites are released into the blood and invade the red blood cells, where they undergo further division and development into sexual forms. When a mosquito bites again, these sexual forms are ingested by the insect where further development occurs to complete the lifecycle.
<P>Although all species of<EM> Plasmodium</EM> have an initial liver phase, only <EM>vivax</EM> and <EM>ovale</EM> leave behind dormant forms which can lead to late relapses of malaria up to three years after exposure.
<P>
<br><H3>Disease prevention</H3>
<P><EM>Falciparum</EM> malaria usually presents ten days after the infective bite, with flu-like symptoms, sweating, fever, aching limbs and shivering. The red blood cells at this stage may be sticking to blood vessel walls and slowing blood flow. This 'sludging' can have serious consequences and lead to renal failure or coma (cerebral malaria) with death ensuing rapidly.
<P>Examination of the blood at this stage (microscopy of thick and thin films) will show up the parasite. However, a negative film does not exclude the diagnosis, and ill patients must be admitted to hospital. Death has occurred when patients have been dismissed with an erroneous diagnosis of flu, resulting in rapid deterioration.
<P>Malaria is also a great mimic and may present itself as cough, diarrhoea, confusion, jaundice and even psychiatric illness. Any illness in a patient returning from a malarious area must be taken very seriously.
<P>
<br><H3>Treatment of infection</H3>
<P>Malaria is a medical emergency that requires urgent hospital treatment. Drug resistance to modern synthetic drugs, such as chloroquine, is such a problem that the tried and tested original quinine is used to treat <EM>falciparum</EM> malaria. However, both mefloquine and halofantrine are also used. Shock, renal failure and other complications of malaria may necessitate intensive therapy nursing in some situations.
<P>Some travellers may be visiting remote parts where prompt medical attention is impossible. They can be provided with drugs for self-treatment. Suggested regimes are:
<P>1 Quinine 600mg three times daily for a period of three days followed by three tablets of fansidar (pyrimethamine plus sulfadoxine).
<P>2 Mefloquine as a single dose of 1,000mg or 15mg/kg, whichever is lower, if not used as a prophylactic.
If standby treatment is being prescribed, it is important that a patient is properly advised on signs and symptoms of malaria and how to use the drugs appropriately; there is good evidence that most patients who take their standby treatment turn out not to have malaria.
<P>Standby treatment is not a substitute for seeking urgent medical attention.
<P>
<br><H3>Chemoprophylactics</H3>
<P>The saying 'prevention is better than cure' holds very true when it comes to malaria and there are several options available. 
<P><li><STRONG>Chloroquine</STRONG>
<br>Well tolerated but of limited use on its own because of widespread resistance, but it can be used in areas such as Central America where malaria is still sensitive. Safe, minor side-effects can include GI upset and exacerbation of psoriasis. It can be taken in pregnancy but must be used with caution in the epileptic. Long-term use is linked to retinal damage but this tends to be with the much higher doses used in rheumatoid arthritis. 
<P><li><STRONG>Chloroquine and proguanil</STRONG>
<br>Chloroquine 300mg (as base, two tablets) weekly plus proguanil 200mg (two tablets) daily is a safe, well tolerated and efficacious regime but needs strict compliance. Satisfactory for the pregnant traveller who insists on visiting a malarious area.
<P>Proguanil is rapidly absorbed, converted to cycloguanil (the active drug) in the liver and has a short half life of six to eight hours. Good levels of protection can be achieved if used correctly but side-effects include mouth ulcers and GI disturbance. If administered in pregnancy, folate supplements are advised. It should be used with caution in renal or hepatic insufficiency. 
It was recommended much more extensively in the past in multidrug-resistant areas where mefloquine is currently the drug of choice. However, the chloroquine/proguanil combination is good for the patient in whom mefloquine is contraindicated.
<P><li><STRONG>Mefloquine</STRONG>
<br>Mefloquine has been available in the UK since 1990 and has been prescribed prophylactically to an estimated 10m travellers worldwide. It is the preferred drug for multidrug-resistant malaria in sub-Saharan Africa.
<P>Experience with mefloquine is growing all the time and recommendations for its use are more widespread, particularly for longer durations. This drug has been the subject of recent adverse media publicity in relation to its side-effects. This is unfortunate and may have something to do with the increase in report-ed cases of malaria we have seen this year. Serious side-effects include psychiatric disturbance and convulsions which have been reported in one in 10,000 users. Less serious side-effects include nausea, vomiting, dizziness, rash and sleep-disturbance.
<P>Mefloquine should not be given to anyone with a history of psychiatric illness or epilepsy or to women in the first trimester of pregnancy. Women should be advised to avoid pregnancy for at least three months after the last dose. It should also be avoided in severe hepatic or renal impairment.
<P>This drug is highly effective and is taken as a single 250mg tablet weekly which aids compliance. Resistance to mefloquine is unfortunately growing in some regions of South East Asia.
<P>Problems with mefloquine highlight the need for protocols when recommending chemoprophylaxis for malaria to keep adverse effects to a minimum.
<P><li><STRONG>Maloprim</STRONG>
<br>Contains pyrimethamine 12.5mg and dapsone 100mg. It is used infrequently now in the UK for prophylaxis but can be useful in areas where<EM> falciparum</EM>-resistant strains occur, such as Oceania. It is usually taken once weekly in combination with chloroquine. It can cause severe bone marrow depression and other toxic effects so is no longer a first-line drug.
<P><li><STRONG>Doxycycline</STRONG>
<br>A tetracycline antibiotic, it is taken prophylactically as a 100mg daily dose but its use in the UK is limited. It is used more widely in Australia and New Zealand for areas of multi-resistant <EM>falciparum</EM> malaria, but is worth considering for mefloquine-resistant areas in SE Asia, such as the Thai/Cambodian and Thai/
Myanmarian border areas. Side-effects include diarrhoea, rash and photosensitivity. It should not be used for pregnant women or children.
<P>
<br><H3>Resistance in the future</H3>
<P>Chloroquine was introduced in 1934 and for many years was the most valuable prophylactic agent available. The WHO had hoped chloroquine would play an important strategic role in its malaria eradication programme but this was not to be.
<P>Chloroquine-resistant<EM> plasmodium</EM> <EM>falciparum</EM> first appeared in SE Asia in 1978 and since then has swept across the world.
<P>Unfortunately, resistance to other drugs is beginning to follow the same pattern.
<P><P>In SE Asia, multiple drug resistance (chloroquine, paludrine, Fansidar, mefloquine) is common and reduced sensitivity to quinine is reported in Thailand, Myanmar, Cambodia and Vietnam. In some parts of Thailand, treatment failure rates with mefloquine are as high as 50 per cent. Resistance to halofantrine appears to be following the path of mefloquine.
New research includes:
<P><li>Artemesia derived from the Chinese herb Qinghaosu. Chinese troops in Cambodia use the drug for prophylaxis and it has been in use in China for over 20 years but this has largely been ignored by the West.
<P><li>Azithromycin is being investigated for prophylactic use
<P><li>Spf66 is a synthetic copolymer vaccine developed in Columbia by joining <EM>plasmodium</EM> merozoite proteins.

<BODY>
<br><br>
Headache is a symptom rather than a disease. Fortunately, the vast majority of the headaches presented at the pharmacy are of minor significance. However, careful consideration should be given to each presentation to exclude serious underlying pathology.
<P>Patients present with a 'headache' when they have a pain in the head. Pharmacists should reserve the term 'headache' to pain in the region of the cranial vault; facial pain should be excluded. There are many causes for headaches and this makes interpretation of the underlying cause complex. It is convenient for pharmacists to consider headaches under the headings: tension, vascular and traction.

<P><br>
<H3>Incidence</H3>
The incidence of headaches is high, it being the second most common (59 per cent) reported problem experienced over a 12-month period, exceeded only by colds (66 per cent). About a quarter of the adult population suffer from a headache every two weeks and it is not surprising that the oral analgesic represents a substantial proportion of the OTC medicine market: 15 per cent in 1994.
<P>Migraine, on the other hand, affects about 5 to 10 per cent of the population. It usually starts between the ages of ten and 30. 
<P><br>
<H3>Types of headaches</H3>
<P><li><STRONG>Tension</STRONG>
<br>This is the most common form and is also known as a nervous or psychogenic headache. It is the result of some internal stress, anxiety or tension which may even be at a subconscious level. Physical stress may also be a cause. Prolonged mental concentration may also trigger a tension headache. 
<P>Tension headache is thought to be the result of contraction of some of the muscles in the back of the neck and scalp. Traditional theory suggests that this increased pressure stimulates pain receptors. Alternatively, there are changes in blood supplies to the area, which causes pain. 
<P><br>
<li><STRONG>Vascular</STRONG>
<br>Changes in blood flow to the brain may cause head pain. These changes result in the second most common form of headache.
<P>A change in blood flow in the cranial region may be due to either vasoconstriction or vasodilatation. Although patients believe hypertension is a significant cause of a headache, this is rarely true. An increase in temperature results in vasodilatation and this is a common cause of headache associated with febrile conditions.
<P>Migraine, both classical and common, is the result of changes in cranial blood flow.  There is initial vasoconstriction of the vascular tree 
giving rise to transient ischaemia, which gives rise to the prodomal symptoms such as the tingling sensation and visual disturbances. Increased platelet aggregation occurs during this initial phase with an increased serotonin level. This may reduce vascular tone reduction and the arteries pulsate. Dilation or distension of the vasculature, especially the meningeal and extracranial arteries follows which produces the pain.
<P>The causes of migraine are many and varied, often provoked by various foods, drugs and external factors, including TV and emotional stress (see diagnosis). There is a genetic component, since it tends to run in families. Furthermore, about three times as many females have classical migraine compared to men.
<P>Vascular headaches, which are the symptom of more serious conditions, are rare but include various intracranial haemorrhages.
<P><br>
<li><STRONG>Traction</STRONG>
<br>There are no pressure sensory nerve endings in brain tissue. However, pressure receptors are present within the cranium and any space occupying material (haemotomas and tumours) will press against structures within the skull, causing pain. One cause of a haemotoma is trauma, like a blow on the head. Inflammation may cause headaches by causing irritation of the meninges, the protective coat of the brain and spinal cord.
<P>In general, traction headaches represent a potentially serious threat to the patient and all should be referred. 
<P><br>
<H3>Patient presentation</H3>
Pharmacists must be aware that the public may present with headache whenever a pain develops anywhere in the head region. Thus it is essential to consider headache and sinusitis simultaneously. Temporal arteritis and trigeminal neuralgia are usually presented as facial pain, but pharmacists must be aware of this potential problem.
<P><br>
<H3>Diagnosis</H3>
Diagnosis can be made easier using the mnemonic SCRUTINY (Update June 1):
<P><STRONG>Symptoms/Complex</STRONG>
<br>In tension headache, pain should be the major symptom present. The pain is often described as a tightness or a dull constant ache but rarely throbbing or pounding. Sometimes shoulder and neck muscle pain and tension are present. Because emotional factors are frequently involved, poor appetite, tiredness, emotional outbursts and instability may be reported. 
<P>Migraine presents as a symptom complex which typically includes nausea and vomiting. Classical migraine has a characteristic set of prodomal (warning) symptoms, which include visual disturbances (blurring, flashing lights and zigzag patterns) and parathesia (tingling, pins and needles). Common migraine presents with the headache, which might be severe with nausea and vomiting, but the prodomal symptoms are absent.
<P>Traction headaches are continuous, severe and dull but feel deep-seated and seldom throb. They are aggravated by lying down and patients often wake up with this type.
<P>If there is an elevated temperature, consideration must be given to the cause of the pyrexia and frequently, the underlying condition requires referral. 
<P>While the symptoms listed below are rare, if any are present, patients must be referred:
<li>skin rash, especially purple
<li>photophobia (note that migraine causes some degree of photophobia)
<li>severe stiff neck 
<li>unconsciousness at any stage
<li>visual problems which are not the prodomal symptoms of migraine
<li>CNS involvement (loss of co-ordination, personality changes, drowsiness)
<li>vomiting, when it bears no relationship to food, with no preceding nausea.
<P>
<STRONG>Region</STRONG>
<br>Location, in conjunction with the description of the pain, provides one of the best diagnostic pointers to the cause of a headache. Tension headaches are usually bilateral, situated in the occipital region (back) and may radiate to form a tight band around the head. Classical migraine pain is initially hemispherical (one side) but may progress to both sides. Common migraine does not present unilaterally. The pain of traction headache often overlies the site of the problem.
<P><STRONG>Universal factors</STRONG>
<br>The major diagnostic features in this area of concern are the trigger factors.
<P><EM>Relieving factors</EM>: headaches usually either spontaneously remit or require minor drug treatment. Migraine may be relieved by resting in a darkened room. 
<P>There is no seasonal or diurnal component with headaches. However, eye strain may (but rarely) cause headaches and a visit to the optician may be valuable.
<P><STRONG>Time/intensity</STRONG>
<br>The majority of headaches presented to the pharmacist are mild and self-limiting. Migraine may be so severe as to preclude work. Also severe and requiring urgent referral is the traction headache. 
<br><P><STRONG>Natural history</STRONG>
<br>Migrainous cluster headaches are more common in men and are characterised by intense pain, especially around one eye. They occur for short periods (20-60 minutes) at varying intervals for hours or rarely for days. Rhinorrhoea may also be present. They recur irregularly, with long periods between successive attacks. Tension headaches are more common as the day progresses since tension increases with time.
<P><STRONG>Your current medication</STRONG>
<br>Few drugs, with the exception of vasodilators, cause headaches. Alcohol is another culprit.
<P><br>
<H3>Management</H3>
<P>Pharmacists can recommend treatment for tension and migrainous headaches; traction headaches require referral. Treatment decisions can be made using the mnemonic CARE (see Update June 1).
<P><STRONG>Chronic/risk group/age</STRONG>
<br>All children with headaches must be referred. The elderly also need special consideration, as should hypertensive patients. 
<P><STRONG>Allergies</STRONG>
<br>Sensitivity to aspirin should be considered here.
<P><STRONG>Reaction of proposed 
medication</STRONG>
<br>Reaction to some of the drugs used to relieve headaches is significant. Aspirin and ibuprofen cause stomach irritation. Asthmatics should also avoid these. Chronic use of analgesics can result in rebound headaches.
<P><STRONG>Establish patient preference</STRONG>
<br>As headaches are so common, many patients have their favourite proprietary preparations, which need to be taken into account.
<P><br>
<H3>Product selection</H3>
The three drugs that constitute the mainstay of drug treatment for headache are systemic analgesics. 
<P><STRONG>Aspirin and ibuprofen</STRONG> interfere with the production of prostaglandins, which play a significant part in the pain and inflammatory process. They also inhibit cytoprotection of the gastric musoca, leading to gastric irritation. Hypersensitivity occurs in some patients, especially those with asthma (about 5 per cent of the population).  
<P>Patients taking low-dose aspirin to reduce platelet aggregation should not take the larger analgesic dose: paracetamol or ibuprofen should be considered. 
<P><STRONG>Paracetamol</STRONG> has overtaken aspirin as the main minor analgesic. It is thought to act through selective inhibition of central cyclo-oxygenase. While it has little gastric effect, damage due to overdose is irreversible and care must be taken to avoid polypharmacy problems.
<P><STRONG>Codeine and dihydrocodeine</STRONG> act centrally on the opioid receptors. Although the dose of codeine in OTC preparations maybe at sub-therapeutic levels, its benefits may be synergistic and there is no doubt that patients frequently prefer combination analgesic products. The major side action of these drugs is constipation.
<P>Caffeine acts as a stimulant but at the dose employed it probably has little effect. Antimusarinics (cyclizine and buclizine) are used in preparations for migraine for their anti-emetic effect.

</center>

<br>
<br>
The use of performance enhancing drugs in sport is not new. In 1865, canal swimmers in Amsterdam were accused of taking a mixture of heroin and cocaine, and in the early years of this century alcohol and strychnine were taken by boxers and a marathon competitor. 
<P>
Top athletes are often so caught up with striving for that extra margin of success that they may resort to any method that seems to bring this goal nearer. In some countries, drug abuse in sport may be routinely incorporated in elite training programmes. At the British Pharmaceutical Conference in London two years ago, the audience sat spellbound as an East German doctor systematically catalogued the programme of drug abuse that had been promoted by the authorities in his country before the fall of communism. He explained the practice of 'drug holidays' where athletes ceased to take drugs at set periods before competition so that the risk of detection was minimised.
<P>
Much of the initial work on drug testing in sport was accomplished by a pharmacist-run laboratory at King's College, London, where an International Olympic Committee-accredited drug testing service is provided for many national and international meetings1. Of the many classes of drugs available only a relative few have been implicated in enhancing performance or masking the use of banned drugs, and consequently placed on a banned or restricted list by the IOC. Here are some of the more widely-abused drugs.
<P><br>
<H3>Stimulants</H3><P>
<li> <STRONG>Amphetamines </STRONG>
<br>Amphetamine sprays were originally prescribed for the treatment of nasal congestion (through vasoconstriction). They are powerful central nervous system stimulants and have been taken to increase the heart rate and allay inhibition before competition. Amounts of 14-21mg of amphetamine administered two to three hours before an event have been shown to improve performance in three-quarters of a sample of swimmers, runners and weight throwers2.
<P>
The drug causes blood to flow from the skin and is particularly dangerous during intense exercise in hot climates. There are numerous reports of cyclists suffering fatalities after taking amphetamines.
<P>
<li><STRONG> Cocaine</STRONG>
<br>Amphetamines have largely been replaced in sport by cocaine, the regular use of which can lead to anxiety, agitation, insomnia and, ultimately, coronary occlusion and death.
<P>
<li> <STRONG>Sympathomimetics </STRONG>
<br>Adrenaline and the sympathomimetics, ephedrine and isoprenaline, are also considered to be stimulants and are banned.  These compounds have many therapeutic applications, notably in the treatment of asthma, and together with some of their derivatives (for example, pseudoephedrine and phenylpropanolamine, etc) are often present in the formulas of OTC medicines, too -  Aller-eze Plus, Lemsip Cold Relief and Day Nurse all contain banned ingredients.Salbutamol and terbutaline are permitted, subject to written notification by the team physician, but they may only be administered by aerosol. Sodium cromoglycate, used mainly to treat allergic asthma, is also allowed
<P>
<li><STRONG>Caffeine </STRONG>
<br>Caffeine produces a mild central stimulation. Maximum urinary levels of 12mg/ml are set by the IOC. The drug is claimed to counteract the reduction in performance caused by fatigue and is popular in rallying, particularly at night. It is thought to work by enhancing fat utilisation, thus sparing glycogen3. As few as four cups of filter coffee or six cans of a famous cola drink may cause a positive dope test.
<P><br>
<H3>Anabolic steroids</H3>
 <P>First used in 1954, anabolic steroids are mainly chemically-derived alternatives to the natural male hormone testosterone. They are designed to separate the anabolic and androgenic features of the hormone and to improve its availability. The drugs achieved spectacular notoriety at the Seoul Olympics in 1988 when Ben Johnson's gold medal was withdrawn after he tested positive for stanozolol. 
<P>
Anabolic steroids constitute nearly half of all positive samples detected by IOC-accredited laboratories. They are used to increase muscle mass, especially in the presence of high protein intake, as well as improving power and speed after intense physical training. There is some discussion as to whether they act directly on muscle tissue or whether they encourage muscle development indirectly by helping prolonged exercise. Performance may be enhanced by increased erythrocyte formation allowing an increased oxygen uptake. 
<P>
Side-effects include hepatic malfunction, coronary heart disease, cancer, sterility and uncontrolled aggressive behaviour4. An increased incidence of tendon damage has also been noticed among athletes taking anabolic steroids due in part to competitors neglecting accepted techniques within their chosen sport. Clenbuterol is a banned compound related to the anabolic steroids that was 'in fashion' for a time. It has been shown to stimulate the deposition of body protein in animals. However, drug testing has not proved to be foolproof. British athlete Diane Modhal, who originally tested positive for testosterone, was later cleared because of possible false results due to degradation of sample.
<P>
<br>
<H3>Beta-blockers</H3>
<P>These drugs are used to lower blood pressure and slow the heart rate. Although they reduce the ability to perform physical exercise and are therefore not the subject of drug testing in endurance events, they help allay anxiety and steady the nerves, and therefore may help competitors in archery, darts, shooting, bowls and snooker. Side-effects include cold extremities, fatigue and, in extreme cases, heart failure.
<P>
<br>
<H3>Diuretics</H3>
<P>Diuretics are sometimes used where a specific weight is needed   for example, with jockeys and boxers. Diuretics shed weight quickly by excessive water loss and by acting as a blocking agent to dilute urine and therefore prevent detection of drugs in other sports. Compounds such as acetazolamide, amiloride and triamterene are banned.
<P>
<br>
<H3>Narcotic analgesics</H3>
<P>Included in this class are a number of drugs related to morphine. They are used as moderate to severe analgesics.  The IOC Medical Commission believes there is evidence that these compounds have been abused in sport and, as there are many other non-narcotic drugs available, they should be banned. Over the counter products containing codeine should not be offered to athletes. Most of these drugs have major side-effects, including respiratory depression and dependence. Dextromethorphan and pholcodine are not banned and can be used as antitussives.
<P>
<br>
<H3>Peptide hormones</H3>
<P> Human growth hormone (hGH) is naturally produced by the body to invoke maturation and physical development. It is now produced synthetically and may be used to increase body mass. Some male athletes use hGH to stimulate testosterone production, increasing aggression and competitiveness. As yet it is undetectable.
<P>
A reverse approach is to use brake drugs, which are generally hormonal and are used to block physical and sexual maturation. They are very popular with female gymnasts. Other banned substances include human chorionic gonadotrophin5, corticotrophin (ACTH) and erythropoietin (EPO).  The latter, a genetically-engineered substance, mimics the effects of training at high altitude by regulating the synthesis of erythrocytes, but in excess can cause fatal blood clots. Five years ago, the drug was blamed for the death of 18 German cyclists from circulation problems.
<P>
The drug disappears rapidly from the body and detection has proved difficult in the past, but recently a new test has been announced. Other drugs are subject to certain restrictions. For example, alcohol and marijuana are not banned, but the presence of both can be tested. There are restrictions on the use of local anaesthetics and corticosteroids.
<P>

<br><H3>Pharmacy advice</H3>
<P>Pharmacists must be vigilant when recommending OTC remedies. This is particularly important for elite and sub-elite athletes who may be subject to drug testing during training, as well as competition. Sports Councils in the UK produce handy cards listing the banned classes of drugs with examples, and a supply is available for customers. There is also a comprehensive guide available, entitled 'Drugs and Sport'. It details all the banned and permitted products.
<P>
Another solution is to recommend complementary remedies. The Sports Council warns that some herbal preparations may contain banned substances from naturally-occurring plants. For example, ginseng root does not contain banned substances, but it is known that marketed tablets (tablets, solutions, teas, etc) bearing the name 'ginseng' may contain other undeclared ingredients, such as ephedrine. The Olympic sprinter Linford Christie took ginseng some years ago and subsequently tested positive for a banned substance. 
<P>
There is no requirement for a comprehensive listing of ingredients in nutritional supplements making it difficult to determine whether doping regulations are liable to be breached. No such risk is involved in recommending homoeopathic remedies and they are not subject to any IOC controls. There is a range of about 30 generic remedies known as 'polychrests' that have a wide spectrum of activity and can be administered to sportspersons safely and effectively, without affecting any concurrent or subsequent treatment. Table 1offers some suggestions for treating common problems. Discussions are in progress with the British Association of Sports Medicine to identify how pharmacists' contribution to sports care can be increased.

<BODY>
<br><br>

The term 'indigestion' is of practical value, but unfortunately means many things to many people. Patients complain of it when they become aware of a pain, discomfort or unpleasant sensation in the upper abdomen or lower chest. Sometimes nausea, vomiting, disturbance of appetite and diarrhoea are presented as indigestion. 
<P>
Because the definition of 'indigestion' is vague, incidence rates will vary. In one survey, 34 per cent claimed to have had indigestion or heartburn in the last year, while 40 per cent said they had stomach upset. About 10 per cent of the population suffer from peptic ulcers at some time and this increases with age. 
<P><BR>

<H3>Causes</H3>
<P>
Indigestion as a term is of little value to the pharmacist and a diagnosis needs to be made. There are two major anatomical areas that are affected by indigestion: 
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Stomach:</STRONG> the pain of indigestion of stomach origin (gastric irritation indigestion) is due to stimulation of the nerves. One mechanism of stimulation is through a disturbance of the gastric mucosa allowing the normal acid content access to these nerve endings, exemplified by ulceration and erosions. Gastric inflammation may be the result of dietary intake exemplified by certain foods, alcohol, smoking and some drugs. Incomplete mastication may be a factor, so defective teeth and hasty meals should be considered.
<P>
There are stretch receptors in the stomach which when stimulated by, for example, overeating or wind, present the patient with the pain of indigestion.
<P>
Physical and mental stress can also cause ulceration.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Oesophagus:</STRONG> the mucosa of the oesophagus is sensitive to acid, and reflux of the stomach contents, which has a low pH, causes pain. 
<P><BR>

<H3>Pathophysiology</H3>
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Stomach related:</STRONG> it is useful to recognise some of the factors involved in the maintenance of a healthy stomach lining, and factors which cause damage. 
<P>
The gastric mucosa is protected from autodigestion by a mucus layer and bicarbonate secreted by epithelial cells maintains this layer at a neutral pH. The histamine mediated release of acid from the pariatal cells is blocked by H2 antagonists. Proton pump inhibitors also reduce acid secretion.
<P>
If a small area of the gastric mucosa is injured, it regenerates within 30 minutes. Prostoglandins appear to promote this repair process and stimulate gastric blood flow. This would account, in part, for the damage caused by the NSAIDs.
<P>
Distension of the stomach will stimulate stretch receptors giving rise to pain. The normal flatus volume ranges from 400 to 2,400mls per day and this is removed by up to 14 episodes of relief which are not apparent. Distension will occur if this normal volume is not relieved or excess 'wind' is not relieved rapidly enough. 
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Oesophageal related:</STRONG> reflux of the stomach content into the oesophagus may be due to an excessive food load, but is more normally the result of incompetence of the lower oesophageal sphincter. This can result from drugs and other substances which reduce muscle tone. 
<P>
Physical displacement of the oesophageal/stomach junction, which is a common feature of hiatus hernia, will reduce the sphincter's efficacy. Pregnancy may displace the stomach and cause temporary sphincter impairment. 
<P>
When a patient lies down, reflux can occur, especially in patients with hiatus hernia. Another factor is being overweight. 
<P><BR>


<H3>Patient presentation</H3>
The SCRUTINY and CARE procedure outlined in the introductory article (<EM>C&D</EM> June 1, pI-II) should be used to respond to symptoms. Patients will present with a variety of terms to describe their symptoms, including indigestion, heartburn, dyspepsia, upset stomach, sour or bitter taste in the mouth, bloating, gas, burning pain in the chest, etc. 
<P><BR>

<H3>Questions to ask</H3>
<STRONG>Diagnosis:</STRONG>
<LI>How long have you had this pain?
<LI>Where is the pain?
<LI>Are there other symptoms?
<LI>Is onset related to food or drugs?
<LI>What relieves the pain?
<LI>Is the pain brought on by physical activity?
<LI>Is your stool colour normal?
<P>

<STRONG>Management:</STRONG>
<LI>What medicines are you currently taking?
<LI>What have you tried for the pain? Did it work?
<LI>Do you suffer from any chronic condition?
<LI>Do you prefer tablets or a liquid?
<P><BR>

<H3>Diagnosis</H3>
<LI><STRONG>Symptom Complex</STRONG>
<BR>Pain is present in all cases of 'indigestion'. The pain may be described as burning, gnawing, bloating or windy. The pain is usually constant and not spasmodic or 'colicky'. The description of the pain may well provide a clue to its cause: burning, in conjunction with retrosternal location and bitter taste in the mouth, points to reflux oesophagitis.
<P>
It is not possible to differentiate between gastric and duodenal ulcers from a description of the type of pain, nor is it within the pharmacist's remit.
<P>
A bloated or 'windy' feeling suggests either excess food or flatulence.
<P>
Nausea and vomiting are rarely present with any form of indigestion and diarrhoea is similarly absent.
If the indigestion is related to excess alcohol, headaches may be present. However, headaches accompanying 'indigestion' should be regarded with care, as should a raised temperature.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Region</STRONG>
<BR>There are two sites for indigestion: the stomach and the oesophagus. Patients can distinguish between epigastric and retrosternal pain, and this may provide a clue to which of the various of the types of indigestion is implicated.
<P>
The term 'heartburn' is related to retrosternal pain and, if this site is indicated, it is essential to consider other reasons for a pain near to the heart such as angina pectoris.  (see Universal Factors).
<P>
Patients often refer to diarrhoea and lower abdominal pain as an 'upset tummy' and the location of the problem will enable the pharmacist to distinguish between potential gastro-enteritis and indigestion.
<P>
<LI><STRONG>Universal Factors</STRONG>
<BR>Provoking factors often provide a clear indication that the pain is the result of indigestion. The major factors to be considered are those related to recent food and drug intake. Food that is 'off' is more likely to result in lower gut problems and diarrhoea. Examination of the drug data sheets and the BNF show that almost all drugs can cause gastro-intestinal symptoms (see Tables 1 and 2).
<P>
Oesophageal reflux may result from overeating, especially in someone with an incompetent lower oesophageal sphincter. Similarly, a patient with hiatus hernia may suffer reflux and thus the pain of heartburn.
<P>
Excess wind may be the result of eating foods that ferment when ingested to produce gas. This is common with pulse vegetables and initially with patients on a high fibre content diet. Bad chewing habits or poor dentition may also result in air being swallowed.
If the indigestion is acute, one of the most important relieving factors is time. Chronic indigestion could well be the result of ulceration and, although healing progresses with time, it is more usual to actively treat the condition with drug therapy.
<P>
Indigestion that is the result of gastric mucosal damage will be relieved by simple antacids, H2 antagonists and proton pump inhibitors. 
<P>
Reflux oesophagitis caused by hiatus hernia is frequently relieved by gravity. Patients who report that their attack occurs when lying down in bed often state that sitting up is helpful.
<P>
Indigestion-caused flatulence may be relieved by eructation (burping). A similar effect is achieved by drinking hot or fizzy drinks.
Pain due to ulcers, especially gastric ulcers may be relieved by eating. However, it is not possible to use the time interval for pain to be relieved by food intake as a diagnostic indicator of whether an ulcer is either gastric or duodenal. The time relationship to ingestion of foods, drink and drugs may provide useful clues to the cause of indigestion.
<P><BR>

<LI><STRONG>Time/Intensity</STRONG>
<BR> Indigestion may be either acute or chronic. Acute indigestion usually lasts for no more than a few hours and often resolves itself spontaneously. However, the pain can be severe even in stomach mucosal indigestion, causing patients to become 'doubled up'. Such cases could represent a serious condition, such as a perforated intestine or severe gastro-enteritis, and referral is required.
<P>
Oesophageal reflux usually causes less pain, but severe symptoms may represent oesophageal ulceration and referral is necessary.
<P>
Chronic indigestion of gastric origin may have a prolonged history, with bouts of severe pain interspersed with less active episodes. Referral is again required.
<P><BR>

<LI><STRONG>Natural History</STRONG>
<BR> Acute indigestion has little natural history. Its onset is rapid and duration short. There are few if any changes in the site, type or even intensity of pain experienced by the patient. It is usually self-limiting.
<P>
Chronic indigestion manifests itself by recurrent pain of varying intensity, usually at the same site. Onset may be associated with events listed under 'Universal Factors'.
<P><BR>

<LI><STRONG>Your Current Medication</STRONG> 
<BR>Any drug may induce gastric indigestion (see Universal Factors). Establishing recent drug history is important as this may point to causation. Oesophageal indigestion is less associated with current drug use, but antimuscarinic, the xanthines and alcohol reduce sphincter control.
<P>
It is important to check if the patient is self-treating: if no relief is obtained from reasonable therapy, indigestion may not be the problem. 
<P>
Patients will frequently self-diagnose indigestion and try many of the OTC remedies. Angina pectoris should always be considered if OTC antacids or H2 antagonists fail to provide relief for retrosternal pain. The most significant pointers to angina are that the pain is induced by physical exercise; it may radiate to the left shoulder and down the left arm; the pain is of short duration if the patient physically rests; sitting down may reduce or eliminate the pain; it is not related to food or drug intake.

<BODY>
<br><br>

A sexually transmitted disease is one that can be spread from one person to another through sexual activity, whether vaginal, anal or oral.
<P>
The most infamous of all STDs is HIV/AIDS and the Government's hard-hitting 'Don't die of ignorance' campaign of the mid-'80s perpetuated the concept of safe sex and put an end to the liberated sexual attitudes that the Pill had fired off in the '60s. Sex was no longer care-free: it could kill.
<P>
The campaign also led to a greater openness about sex and a general awareness of STDs. People were no longer embarrassed to use a condom and this helped to stem the spread of other STDs.
<P><BR>

<H3>Health of the Nation</H3>
<P>
The Government prioritised sexual health and HIV/AIDS in its Health of the Nation targets and set itself the following objectives: 
<UL>
<LI> to reduce the incidence of sexually transmitted disease, other than HIV/AIDS
<LI> to develop further monitoring and surveillance 
<LI> to provide effective services for the diagnosis and treatment of STDs.
</UL>
<P>
The Government set itself a target of reducing the incidence of gonorrhoea (a marker of penetrative sex) among men and women aged 15-64 by at least 20 per cent by 1995 (from 61 new cases per 100,000 population in 1990 to no more than 49 cases).
<P><BR>

<H3>Why treat STDs?</H3>

<P>
It is important to diagnose and treat STDs immediately for the following reasons: 


<OL>

<LI>Painful, distressing and contagious acute symptoms
<LI>Psychological effects of having an STD 
<LI>Long-term consequences (sequelae), such as infertility, ectopic pregnancy and genital cancers
<LI>The need to inform partners and stop further transmission.
</OL>



<P>
Evidence from developing countries has shown that STD associated with ulcers may facilitate the transmission of HIV infection. 
<P>
Genito-urinary medicine (GUM) clinics, rather than GP surgeries, are the best place to manage STDs, but there is, unfortunately, a stigma attached to them.
<P><BR>

<H3>Common STDs</H3>
<P>
Suspected bacterial infections are initially treated with antibiotics, and diagnosis is confirmed by taking swabs for analysis. Contact tracing is an integral part of the management of STDs, since partners are usually also affected and may even be asymptomatic. Patients presenting with one particular STD may be screened for other pathogens as they often co-exist.
<P>
It is important to be clear about the symptoms of thrush, a non-sexually transmitted condition caused by the yeast <EM>candida albicans</EM> commonly presented in the pharmacy and simply treated over the counter with imidazoles such as clotrimazole. 
<P>
In women, the symptoms include a thick white vaginal discharge, swelling of the vulva, soreness and pain on urination and sex, and itching. In men, thrush may present as a swelling of the penis.
<P><BR>

<H3>Gonorrhoea</H3>
<P>
Gonorrhoea is caused by<EM> neisseria gonorrhoea</EM>. The bacteria is present in cervical, urethral, rectal and throat secretions and is transmitted through direct sexual 
contact.
<P>
Although most women are asymptomatic, only a small percentage of men are and they tend to present with symptoms within three to five days. These include urethral discharge, burning pain on passing urine and sometimes irritation or discharge from the anus. Complications can lead to inflamed testicles, causing abscesses that may result in castration.
<P>
In symptomatic women, purulent vaginal discharge, anorectal discomfort and frequent urges to pass urine are common. 
<P>
Gonorrhoea can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, which presents with lower abdominal pain, tenderness and fever. It is important to start treatment immediately to avoid the late complication of infertility.
Gonorrhoea can also be transmitted through non-sexual activity such as during pregnancy.
<P>

<LI> <STRONG>Treatment </STRONG>

<BR>
Amoxycillin (or ampicillin) with probenecid. In penicillin-resistant organisms or in penicillin allergy, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin or deep intramuscular injections of spectinomycin. 
<P><BR>

<H3>Syphilis</H3>
<P>
Syphilis is a systemic disease caused by <EM>treponema pallidum</EM>, a motile corkscrew bacteria which is transmitted through blood transfusions and sexual contact. It is found in blood and lesions of affected people. 
<P>
Primary symptoms appear two to four weeks after exposure to the pathogen as papules on the penis, labia, cervix or anus, which ulcerate to form painless, hard sores. The secondary symptoms follow two to three months after the sores have healed and include red/brown non-itchy rash across the whole body; warty, plaque-like lesions in the prianal area; and ulcers in the mouth and on the external genitalia. A combination of fever, sore throat, painful joints and general malaise can also be expected. 
<P>
If left untreated, syphilis will progress to the tertiary stage, presenting as bone and viscera lesions and can even lead to neurological and cardiovascular problems. Congenital syphilis can occur.
<P>

<LI><STRONG> Treatment</STRONG>

<BR>
Procaine penicillin injections (tetracycline or erythromycin if penicillin-allergic) for 10-21 days depending on syphilis phase.
<P><BR>

<H3>Genital warts</H3>
<P>
Warts are caused by certain forms of the human <EM>papillomavirus</EM> and have been of particular concern because of their association with cervical cancer. 
<P>
Warts do not always appear immediately after infection and may be missed if they are hidden inside the vagina, the anus or on the cervix. They appear as small non-malignant growths that feel gritty and hard.
<P>

<LI> <STRONG>Treatment</STRONG>
<BR>

Genital warts often clear up by themselves, but there are several topical treatment options available, both physical and chemical, most often administered in clinics. Treatment removes visible warts only and does not get rid of the underlying wart virus completely. Recurrences after successful treatment can occur in as many as one in three people.
<P>
Chemical treatments: keratolytics (such as lactic or salicylic acid); podophyllum and podophyllotoxin; injections of 5-fluorouracil are due for launch.
<P>
Physical treatments: cryotherapy (freezing the wart with liquid nitrogen); cauterisation (burning the warts with an electrically-heated probe); laser treatment (useful for large areas); surgery.
<P>
Women who have had warts or whose partners have been affected are advised to have annual smear tests.
<P><BR>

<H3>Herpes</H3>
<P>
Genital herpes is caused by the Herpes simplex virus, primarily HSV-2. However, HSV-1 (cold sore virus) has been implicated in 10 per cent of cases and can be transmitted through oral sex. 
<P>
The virus is carried in the fluid of blisters found on the mouth or genitals of an infected person. Once infected, the virus travels to the nerve cell bodies where it stays dormant until reactivated again by trigger factors, such as stress, menstruation, fatigue and sexual intercourse. Recurrent attacks tend to be shorter and less severe.
<P>
First episode genital herpes lasts several weeks and tends to be more severe in women. The infection presents as painful multiple lesions, beginning as vesicles and progressing to ulceration, crusting before they heal. Systemic symptoms are also common and include fever and malaise, and sometimes aseptic meningitis and dysuria.
<P>
Neonatal infection can be acquired during birth but Caesarean section can avoid this happening.
<P>
<LI> <STRONG>Treatment</STRONG>
<BR>
There is no cure for herpes, but an anti-viral, such as aciclovir, famciclovir and valaciclovir, can help minimise the severity and length of the first attack, and can be taken for recurrent attacks when prodromal symptoms appear. 
<P><BR>

<H3>Hepatitis B</H3>
<P>
About 500-600 cases of acute hepatitis B are reported in the UK each year, but the World Health Organisation states that up to 80 per cent of cases worldwide go unreported. It is transmitted through similar routes to HIV but is about 100 times more infectious. 
<P>
The first symptoms of hepatitis appear between one and six months after contact and include general flu-like symptoms, severe tiredness, loss of appetite and painful joints. Hepatitis may result in inflammation of the liver, jaundice and long-term liver damage, such as cirrhosis and even liver cancer.
<P>

<LI> <STRONG>Treatment:</STRONG>
<BR>
There is no treatment and, once infected, the virus stays within the body. Acute attacks will need bed rest. Vaccines are recommended for people at risk, such as travellers, hospital staff and policemen.
</UL>
<P><BR>

<H3>Other STDs</H3>
<P>

<LI>Non-specific genital infection
<BR>
This is normally caused by bacteria that are generally found in small numbers in the genital area but which have multiplied excessively. Symptoms include discharge and inflammation around the genital area, and pain on passing urine. Antibiotics are the answer but vaginal preparations that re-establish normal vaginal flora may help. Antibacterial vaginal creams are used in mixed bacterial infections.

<P>
<LI> Chlamydia
<BR>
This caused by <EM>chlamydia trachomatis</EM>. There are usually no visible signs of infection but women may have vaginal discharge or pain on passing urine. Tetracyclines, macrolides and some quinolones are successful at treating the infection, and more recently doxycycline, erythromycin and azithromycin. 
<P>
<LI> Trichomoniasis
<BR>
This is caused by trichonomad parasites and is usually found in the vagina and urethra. Men have no symptoms, while women may experience itching, irritation and discharge. The organism may be transferred through sex and close body contact. Metronidazole is the drug of choice but tinidazole is also effective.
<P><BR>

<CENTER><H3>Protecting against disease</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The condom is the essence of safe sex and provides the only protection against HIV/AIDS and other STDs. Around 160 million condoms are bought every year by 23 per cent of the population and sales over the last five years have almost doubled.
<P>
Pharmacisits have a vital role in sex health promotion; offering advice on STDs and condoms; and on referring suspected STDs. The following needs to be considered when advising on which condoms to use:
<P>
<LI>anal or vaginal sex - stronger condoms are needed for anal sex. Condoms for vaginal penetration come in a range of thicknesses depending on personal preference. Durex is planning to introduce polyurethane condoms, which are thinner and stronger than standard latex condoms
<P>
<LI>allergies to latex - hypoallergenic condoms should be recommended
<P>
<LI>lubricants and spermicides - some condoms are coated in one or the other or both. If additional lubricants are to be used, they must be water-based as oil-based formulations may weaken condoms
<P>
<LI> anatomically-shaped condoms - these are thought to aid compliance by providing a better fit

Cannabis sativa is a herbaceous annual plant which contains psychoactive constituents known as cannabinoids, of which the most psychoactive is delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). These are found in a resin secreted by the plant.
The earliest writings about the use of cannabis date back to ancient China when it was banned as a liberator of sin. The ancient Indian culture worshipped its effects and the present-day Rastafarians have integrated the weed as part of their religion.
Cannabis is used widely in the UK and six million people in Britain are estimated to have tried the drug. Home Office data for 1994 have shown seizures by the police and other authorities of cannabis products rising from nearly 16,000 in 1983 to around 69,000 in 1993 (Home Office 1995).
<P><BR>
<H3>Modes of ingestion</H3><P>
Cannabis is usually either smoked in a joint or reefer either as pure dried herb, or the herb, resin or oil mixed with tobacco. It may also be eaten, often incorporated into food such as biscuits or cakes. The onset of action will depend on the route of administration, as will the metabolism and duration of effects. 
<P>
A typical joint contains 50-150mg of THC with a bioavailability of around 5-25 per cent. It has been estimated that only 2-3mg is needed for the occasional user to obtain a desired effect, although some heavy users in the West Indies are estimated to use above 400mg per day (<EM>Hall et al</EM> 1994).
THC is very lipid soluble, stored in the fat reservoirs and slowly released into the bloodstream. It has been reportedly detected in the bloodstream at least 28 days after use and has implications for individuals undergoing drug testing procedures.
<P><BR>
<H3>Cannabis effects</H3><P>
Acetylcholine may be implicated in mediating the effects of the drug, and the dopaminergic mechanism, prostaglandins and cyclic AMP may also be involved (<EM>Dollery</EM> 1991).
<P>
The effects of cannabis vary between individuals and depend on the dose, the route of administration and also the conditions under which observations are made. 
<P>
The psychoactive effects are split into desirable and undesirable, but it is the physical effects that have been exploited when finding new ideas for its use. 
<P>
<STRONG>Desirable effects:</STRONG> include mild euphoria, relaxation, distortions of time and space, increased tendency to laugh and talk.
<P>
<STRONG>Undesirable effects:</STRONG> include anxiety, panic, paranoia, depression, tachycardia. Hallucinations are rare and are only seen at high doses. There have been no reports of acute cannabis poisoning.
<P>
The drug has an effect on psychomotor performance and may interfere with skilled tasks. However, reports state that drivers who have taken cannabis tend to drive more slowly and take fewer risks than those on alcohol.
<P>
<STRONG>Chronic effects:</STRONG> these are reported at the cellular level where it interferes with cell metabolism. There is not, as yet, any clear evidence of the effect of chronic use on the immune system. Its use in pregnancy and women trying to conceive should be dis-couraged as it may interfere with foetal development. 
<P><BR>

<H3>Psychotic episodes </H3><P>

Prolonged use may give rise to symptoms of chronic bronchitis, such as wheezing, sputum production and cough, and psychological dependence and tolerance. Cannabis use can infrequently cause acute psychotic episodes, appearing as confusional states. Although evidence that cannabis has a role in chronic psychotic or affective disorders is not convincing, the drug may modify the course of an already established illness (<EM>Thomas</EM> 1993). 
<P>
A link has also been established between cannabis use and relapse in schizophrenia with users having significantly more and earlier psychotic relapses (<EM>Linszen et al</EM> 1994).
A recent letter to the <EM>British Medical Journal</EM> reported on psychosis among methadone patients who have taken skunk - the product of plants which have been selectively bred for their high THC content - often as little as an average-sized joint (<EM>Wiley et al</EM> 1995).
<P><BR>

<H3>Drug interactions</H3><P>

Cannabis interacts with antimuscarinic agents, tri-cyclic antidepressants (tachy-cardia), alcohol, disulfiram (isolated case of hypomanic-like reaction), fluoxetine (isolated report of mania), theophylline (in cannabis smokers who may need higher doses of theophylline as it is cleared more quickly). (<EM>Stockley</EM> 1994.)
<P><BR>

<H3>Medical uses</H3>
<P>
Currently, two derivatives of cannabis are licensed for use in the UK. Both are anti-emetics, which are considered to be as effective as phenothiazines, but have a high incidence of side-effects and, in theory, may cause immunosuppression (<EM>Ashton</EM> 1987).
<P>
<STRONG>Nabilone:</STRONG> a synthetic cannabinoid, is licensed as an anti-emetic in patients receiving chemotherapy. One report looked at the effectiveness of Nabilone on nausea and vomiting after total abdominal hysterectomy, using a prospective, double-blind study of 60 women. Results showed no significant difference between Nabilone and metoclopramide for post-operative nausea and vomiting <EM>(Lewis et al</EM> 1994). 
<P>
Nabilone has been shown to be effective in intractable nausea and vomiting in AIDS; one patient was given 1mg of Nabilone twice a day after the failure of other drugs. The drug caused complete cessation of the symptoms and the patient generally felt more comfortable (<EM>Green et al</EM> 1989).
<P>
There have been reports of Nabilone being used for other conditions, for example in multiple sclerosis. In a study of a single patient, there was a striking reduction in pain from muscle spasm, frequency of nocturia and an improvement in wellbeing compared with placebo <EM>(Martyn et al</EM> 1995). 
<P>
Due to the cardiovascular and behavioural effects of cannabinoids, Nabilone should be used with caution in patients with cardiovascular and psychiatric disorders, and may interact with diazepam, barbiturates, CNS depressants and codeine. 
<P>
<STRONG>Dronabinol:</STRONG> recently in the UK, the cannabinoid has been made available on a named patient basis.
The drug, marketed in the US as Marinol as an oral preparation, is used as an anti-emetic on cancer chemotherapy and to treat anorexia in AIDS patients. It contains synthetically produced dronabinol and will be licensed for use as an anti-emetic in cancer chemotherapy (<EM>PJ</EM>, 1995).
<P>
<STRONG>Cannabis:</STRONG> smokable marijuana or oral THC has been used to treat nausea and vomiting in cancer patients. Schwartz and Beveridge, in their survey of American oncologists, found that smokable or oral cannabis was the ninth most preferred treatment for mild symptoms and the sixth in severe symptoms.
<P>
Oncologists who had prescribed it felt it had been effective in 50 per cent of patients, although they estimated that one in four had experienced side-effects. Interestingly, only 8 per cent would prescribe more widely if the legal restrictions were removed (<EM>Schwartz & Beveridge </EM>1994). 
<P>
Other indications for cannabis use include the treatment of glaucoma, appetite stimulation, treatment of asthma, anticonvulsant properties, anti-spasmodic effects in disorders such as multiple sclerosis, anti-anxiety. 
<P><BR>

<H3>R&D into cannabis</H3>
<P>
Research into cannabis is hampered in part by the fact that the drug is classed under Schedule 1 of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 1985, and any research requires a Home Office licence. In spite of this, reports in the medical literature show that work is being carried out. 
<P>
In the mid-1980s, canna-binoids were tested for their ability to reduce intra-ocular pressure in the rabbit. Derivatives of delta-9 and delta-8 THC were found to be effective (<EM>ElSohly et al</EM> 1984). Other research has shown that cannabinoids can reduce aqueous humour formation and increase outflow (<EM>McLaughlin & Chiou</EM> 1985).
<P>
Synthetic non-psychotropic cannabinoids have been produced which have anti-inflammatory activity and low level of side-effects. Given orally, they were successful at reducing oedema in mice paws caused by inflammatory agents (Burstein et al 1992). 
Cannabinoids may also have a powerful effect on spasticity and ataxia in multiple sclerosis, as was shown in a study of a patient who had improvements in symptoms when he smoked marijuana cigarettes (<EM>Meinck et al</EM> 1989). THC and cannabidiol have both been reported to have antibacterial activity (<EM>Dollery</EM> 1991)
<P>
The problems of using cannabis and cannabis derivatives long-term are not yet known. As mentioned before, the use of cannabis may have a negative effect on outcomes in psychotic illness. Other research has shown there to be effects on the immune system. The drug also affects the heart by increasing workload, postural hypotension and increased plasma volume, and so could be unsuitable for patients with concurrent cardiovascular problems. The drug is also believed to interfere with hormonal secretions and may disrupt gonadal function in the male, according to animal studies.
 <P><BR>

<H3>Legal issues </H3>
<P>
The issues surrounding the legalisation or decriminalisation of cannabis are never far from the news. However, more recently, 
there have been calls to review the law for cannabis regulating its use for medical rather than leisure purposes, so that more research can be undertaken into its potential uses. 
<P>
The Internet currently has a whole host of information on Cannabis and Medicine, giving both personal opinions and references to support these views 
(<A HREF="http://www.foobar.co.uk/users/ukcia/medicine.html">http://www.foobar.co.uk/users/ukcia/medicine.html</A>). Conditions for which cannabis is considered to be useful by the authors of this Internet site are: asthma, insomnia, kidney dialysis, antimicrobial effects, antinutritional effects, dystonias and alcoholism. Such views are not necessarily, however, supported by the literature on current research.
<P><BR>
<H3>Pharmacy role</H3>
<P>
The community pharmacist may not often come into contact with patients being treated with cannabinoids for medicinal purposes. However, they may get asked for information on cannabis by members of the general public, for example parents concerned about their children using the drug. The community pharmacist, in addition to providing advice on such matters, should be aware of where their local information sources are and any agencies that may be suitable for referring the request onwards. 
<P>
In addition, they may have to advise patients on the concurrent use of cannabis with either prescribed or over the counter medication.

<BODY>
<br><br>
Careful data gathering as outlined in the first article <a href="uptummy.html">(C&D August 3, pi-ii)</a> will have led to a diagnosis of indigestion. Differentiation between oesophageal and stomach indigestion is not difficult, but management strategies may differ. 
<p>
Before proposing a management plan, it is essential to consider specific problems related to the patient as indicated by the mnemonic CARE.
<p>

<b>Chronic/Risk Group/Age </b>
<br>
Patients at either end of the age scale must be considered with extreme caution. Babies with 'indigestion' may be suffering from colic and the use of adult indigestion preparations is inappropriate. If the problem is not colic or wind, referral is required. Children (2-16 years) do get indigestion, mainly of the stomach type and may be treated if the cause is food indiscretion. Drug-induced problems can occur and may be treated in the normal manner. Refer to the GP in the case of a prescribed drug or for advice on an alternative preparation.  
<p>
The elderly often present with indigestion and the choice between treatment or referral will depend on the type of indigestion, its duration and its cause. Drug-related problems are more common simply because they tend to take more medicines. Patients may be treated symptomatically so long as care is taken in selecting a suitable preparation. 
<p>
Patients with chronic diseases do not present a problem except those with diabetes (change in food absorption) and epilepsy (change in drug absorption).
<p>
<b>Allergies</b>
<br>
This is of little significance in this disease state.
<p>
<b>Reaction of proposed medication</b>
<br>
Interactions with either the patient or current medication must be considered (<a href="#tableone">see Table 1</a>).
<p>
<b>Establish patient preference</b>
<br>
 Antacids are frequently available in either a solid or liquid form. Although the liquid form may have a faster onset of action, bottles tend to be bulkier and less convenient for travel. Tablets which are sucked or chewed may have a long duration of action. In some cases, there is a difference in composition between formulations of the same named preparation: Gaviscon liquid is higher in sodium than tablets; Aludrox tablets contain magnesium which is absent in the liquid version.

<p><br>

<H3>Product selection</H3>
There are four groups of OTC indigestion remedies: antacids, H2 antagonists, gastric rafts and antiflatulants.
<p>
The pain of gastric irritation indigestion is associated with decreased pH. Antacids and H2 antagonists used are designed to either raise the hydrogen ion concentration or reduce acid production. 
<p><br>

<H3>Antacids </H3>
These preparations are based on sodium, calcium, magnesium, aluminium and bismuth. They are indicated for acute gastric irritation indigestion, providing rapid relief by neutralising excess acid in the stomach. Their side-effects make them unsuitable for long-term use.
<p>
The various salts have differing powers of neutralisation and are systemically absorbed to differing degrees. 
<p>
<li><b>Sodium</b><br>
Sodium bicarbonate may be used on its own and is also a common ingredient of many antacid preparations. It has a very rapid onset of action but has poor neutralising power, produces gas which may lead to distension, causes rebound hyperacidity and leads to hypernatraemia. It is not ideal and should be avoided by patients on restricted sodium intake and those with hypertension.
<p>
<li><b> Calcium and magnesium </b><br>
 These have good neutralising capacity and are widely employed. Calcium may have a constipating effect while magnesium may lead to diarrhoea. Combination of the two metals' ions utilises their opposing actions to produce a bowel-neutral product.
<br>
Hypercalcaemia may be a danger with calcium containing products if the patient also has a high calcium intake from other sources. Magnesium is excreted via the kidney and should be avoided in patients with renal problems.
<p>
<li><b> Aluminium</b><br>
The hydroxide has a good neutralising capacity and is commonly used. There is no link between Alzheimer's and aluminium in medicines due to the short treatment duration and low solubility of aluminium complex formed in the stomach. 
Aluminium is usually combined with magnesium salts to reduce absorption, increase the combined neutralising capacity and the duration of action.
<p>
<li><b> Bismuth </b><br>
There are very few preparations containing bismuth. It is not an antacid, but its primary use is as an antidiarrhoeal, although the suggested indications include indigestion. Bismuth chelate is one of the ingredients of 'triple therapy' eradication of <EM>Helicobacter pylori</EM>.
<p><br>

<H3>H2 antagonists</H3>
Use of antacids should be regarded as the first-line treatment for relief of the symptoms of gastric irritation indigestion. Long-term use is not encouraged, but many patients use them on a day to day basis without serious adverse effects.
<p>
The introduction of OTC H2 antagonists has provided pharmacists with a suitable drug to treat chronic indigestion. However, the product licences of these preparations specifically state that they should not be used for more than two weeks. They block histamine-mediated gastric acid secretion. It should be noted that the strength of OTC H2 antagonists is half the common strength of the drug when prescribed. 
<p>
Unlike ranitidine and famotidine, cimetidine retards liver drug metabolism. This has implications for patients on warfarin, phenytoin and theophylline who should not be counter-prescribed cimetidine. Famotidine is slowly absorbed with a long half-life. This means that while its onset of action is slow (about one hour), it remains active for a long time (eight to nine hours), making once or twice daily dosage a possibility in many patients.
<p>
The H2 antagonists are also licensed to treat heartburn (oesophageal reflux). Combination with an alginate controls the symptoms better that using it alone. 
<p><br>

<H3>Gastric rafts</H3> 
In contact with water (or stomach content) alginic acid and its salts form a gel. Preparations containing alginates also contain sodium bicarbonate which reacts with stomach acid to form a 'floating raft'. In theory, this raft will be the first of the stomach content to be forced passed the oesophageal sphincter and acts to coat the sensitive oesophageal lining with a protective coat. These preparations are of value to sufferers of gastric reflux. 
<p><br>

<H3>Antiflatulants </H3>
Dimethicone is a non-absorbed surface active agent which causes small gas bubbles trapped in the stomach content to coalesce into larger units which are more easily expelled (eructation, belching). 
<p>
Volatile oils, such as peppermint, anise and other carminatives, may relieve flatulence, but little is known of the pharmacology underlying their use. They are less popular now and tend to be aimed at infant colic and minor gastric discomfort.
<p><br>

<H3>Other products </H3>
Peppermint is also indicated for irritable bowel syndrome as is alverine citrate. Anti-spasmodics which have an antimuscarinic effect reduce muscle tone and gastric motility. However, their side-effects limit their use, especially in the case of oesophageal reflux when they reduce the efficacy of the lower oesophageal sphincter. There appears to be little justification in the use of aspirin in a effervescent formulation for indigestion.

<CENTER><b>Table 2: referral</b></CENTER>
<p>

Referral is required if an adequate explanation of the pain cannot be established. Consideration should be given to food and drink intake, drugs, eating, emotional stress and activity.
<br>Specifically, referral is advisable if:
<li> symptoms persist after treatment with appropriate product
<li> symptoms have lasted for more than three days (continuous)
<li> pain is severe, especially if not spasmodic in nature
<li> vomiting present
<li> weight loss
<li> infants (the problem not being wind or colic of short duration)
<li> children (not related to excess food intake)
<li> any blood loss from rectum or in vomit
<li> pain associated with physical effort (especially if pain radiates to left shoulder and arm)
<li> pain not restricted to epigastrium or sternum
<li> the problem is prescribed drug-related

Currently there are 22 diuretics listed in the BNF and this does not include combination products. The range available is excessive and within the three main diuretic groups there is often very little to choose between drugs.
<p>
Pharmacists who are advising local GPs on formulary development need to consider which diuretics to include on a prescribing list. With so many products to choose from, there is intense competition between companies and claims can often be very persuasive. This article will include the basic principles in choosing a diuretic; a suggested list for inclusion in a practice formulary; adverse drug reactions; drug interactions; and cases of inappropriate diuretic use.
<p>
<br>

<h3Mode of action</h3>
A diuretic is any substance that increases urine and solute production. A therapeutically-useful diuretic therefore must increase the output of sodium - the body's most important solute - as well as water.
<p>
Diuretics can work outside the kidney. For example, by inhibiting the release of anti-diuretic hormone which happens with alcohol. Increasing cardiac output and renal blood flow - as a result of using digitalis, for example - will also cause diuresis. However, in clinical practice, the kidney is the most important organ through which diuresis is effected. 
<p>
The normal glomerular filtration rate is about 300 litres daily, yet the daily volume of urine is just over 1 litre. The balance - over 99 per cent being re-absorbed by the renal tubules - is a considerable feat. Clinically-useful diuretics act on the renal tubule and not on the glomerulus, since effects here would have major cardiovascular repercussions.
<p>
Diuretics are classified by the site on which they affect the renal tubule:
<p>

<li><b> Proximal convoluted tubule</b>
<br>
Here most of the glomerular filtrate, sodium plus water, is re-absorbed (60 per cent of filtered sodium). As a result, there is no change in sodium concentration in the fluid remaining in the tubule. Osmotic diuretic manitol and urea act here by preventing water, and therefore sodium, re-absorption. They are seldom used in clinical practice.
<p>

<li><b>Loop of Henle</b>
<br>
Here sodium is actively re-absorbed without water, so that a concentration gradient develops between the urine and the blood. The net effect is absorption of water into the blood. Diuretics inhibit the transport of chloride ions in the ascending limb of the loop of Henle and consequently sodium ions are excreted back into the tubule to preserve the cation/anion balance. The result is more sodium in the urine, less of a concentration gradient, less water re-absorbed, and more urine produced. There is also increased potassium loss.
<br>
Diuretics that act here - the loop diuretics - are the most potent and include frusemide and bumetanide.
<p>

<li><b> Thick ascending limb of loop of Henle</b>
<br>
This is the main site of action of the thiazide diuretics, but loop diuretics also act here. They reduce sodium absorption but are less powerful compared to the loop diuretics.
<p>

<li><b>Distal convoluted tubule</b>
<br>
This is the site of action of the potassium-sparing diuretics. Since only 5 per cent of sodium re-absorption takes place in the distal tubule, these drugs only produce weak natriuresis by blocking the exchange of sodium for potassium - they produce a weak diuresis, but their use results in potassium retention.
<p>
<br>

<h3>Indications</h3>

<li><b>Acute heart failure</b>
<br>
Thiazide diuretics used alone are the treatment of choice in mild uncomplicated acute failure when sinus rhythm is preserved. For more severe heart failure the loop diuretics are preferred. Where there are low glomerular filtration rates, a combination of a loop diuretic with the thiazide metazolone is often successful. If there is pulmonary oedema, then high doses of loop diuretics may be given. Heart failure is regarded as severe when the dose of frusemide needed to control symptoms reaches 80mg daily.
<p>

<li><b> Chronic heart failure</b>
<br>
For the maintenance of mild or moderate failure the thiazides are usually adequate and are well tolerated.
<p>

<li><b> Hypertension</b>
<br>
The use of thiazides in hypertension is currently being reappraised, as an adverse effect on plasma lipids has been added to their other well known biochemical disturbances. But they still remain the first-line drug for mild to moderate hypertension. Lower doses of thiazides are effective and there is a flat dose response curve: there is often little benefit in prescribing bendrofluazide 5mg daily as a maximum response can be achieved with 2.5mg daily.
<p>
<br>

<h3>Choice of diuretics</h3>

<li><b>Thiazides</b>
<br>
Thiazide diuretics are more effective than loop diuretics in the management of hypertension, and are preferred in cases of mild oedema because of their gentler action. Bendrofluazide is the least expensive agent and is appropriate for routine use. In renal failure, their effectiveness is markedly reduced since they have less access to their site of action - the renal tubule.
Thiazide-related compounds include xipamide (Diurexan) and indapamide (Natrilix). Xipamide has a maximal effect similar to frusemide but with a longer duration of action. It is unclear if it has advantages over other thiazides. 
<p>
Indapamide at low dose has a low diuretic action, but due to its direct effect on vascular smooth muscle tone, it effectively reduces blood pressure. It has recently been shown to have a positive effect in reducing/regressing ventricular hypertrophy, an independent risk factor in coronary heart disease. It also has a negative effect on blood sugar and lipids.
<p>

<li><b> Loop diuretics</b>
<br>
Frusemide and bumetanide are potent short-acting diuretics and their potency is dose-related. They remain effective in renal disease with low glomerular filtration rates. At the recommended dose these drugs are equipotent. Frusemide is the drug of choice in patients requiring a loop diuretic.
<p>

<li><b> Potassium-sparing diuretics</b>
<br>
Spironolactone is no longer licensed for the treatment of essential hypertension or idiopathic oedema. Amiloride and triamterene conserve potassium by direct action on sodium and potassium transport. These agents have a minimal diuretic effect alone, but are mainly used in combination with thiazide and loop diuretics to conserve potassium in patients at risk of hypokalaemia.
<p>
<br>

<h3>K+ supplements</h3>
Most patients on thiazide and loop diuretics do not develop clinically-significant hypokalaemia. The risk of hypokalaemia is dose-related and is increased by a high sodium intake - a clear reason why patients should be encouraged to adopt a low-sodium diet.
<p>
The frequency of hypokalaemia is less in patients with heart failure than in patients with hypertension because the former have a higher serum potassium before treatment.
<p>
Mild hypokalaemia may be hazardous and potassium supplementation might be considered in:
<br>
<li> oedamatous patients with cardiac or hepatic failure, particularly those receiving digoxin
<li> the elderly and the chronically sick who frequently have an inadequate amount of potassium in their diet
<li> diabetic patients and patients receiving concomitant therapy with corticosteroids or carbenoxolone.
<p>
Potassium supplements at recommended doses are relatively ineffective in rectifying potassium depletion. They also carry the risk of oesophageal erosion. Diuretic preparations that contain a potassium supplement (Burinex K) have too little diuretic to cause hypokalaemia and too small a dose of potassium to correct it, making their use irrational.
<p>
A diuretic with the addition of a potassium-sparing diuretic is now considered the most appropriate method of conserving potassium when this is required. The lowest dose should be used, as at high doses there exists the possibility of developing hyperkalaemia. This may be provided by the regimen or the use of a fixed-ratio combination such as Moduretic or Navispare. The lowest possible dose should be used.
<p>
<br>

<h3>Formularies </h3>
Most practice formularies are designed to satisfy the bulk of practice needs - for example the needs of 80 per cent of patients. This allows the list of drugs included to be very selective so that, with difficult cases, GPs are allowed to go outside the list. Also where a drug is included, it would be available in all strengths and forms.
<p>
The following might be a suitable list for most practice patients:
<br>
<li> Bendronfluazide
<li> Frusemide
<li> Moduretic and Moduretic 25
<li> Frumil and Frumil LS
<li> Amiloride.
<p>
<br>

<h3>Adverse reactions</h3>
The most common side-effect of diuretics is postural hypotension, which is dependent on the drug, the dose and the patient. For example, a loop diuretic at a high dose in an elderly patient is likely to produce falls due to postural hypotension.
<p>
As with all drugs, mild gastro-intestinal effects are also common, but should be less problematic as the patient becomes accustomed to the drug.
<p>
Impotence is a reversible side-effect that disappears on withdrawing the drug. It is particularly problematic for many men who find difficulty seeking help for a problem they do not readily identify as an adverse drug reaction. Communicating the possibility of this side-effect by way of a readable product insert or leaflet will avoid embarrassment and might help more men to seek advice and, where necessary, have the medicine altered.
<p>
Photo-sensitivity is an infrequent but troublesome side-effect, particularly with thiazide diuretics and patients should therefore be warned to avoid exposure to strong sunlight.
<p>
The metabolic side-effects that frequently occur with thiazides result in hyperglycaemia which must be avoided in diabetic patients. They also cause a rise in serum cholesterol levels but the clinical significance of this is controversial. 
<p>
It has been argued that the rise in serum cholesterol caused by these drugs outweighs the benefits of treating hypertension resulting in no net gains in patient survival. Where a patient has a high serum cholesterol level greater than 7mmol/L, then the GP is best to avoid a thiazide.
<p>
Treatment with thiazide diuretics is often associated with the appearance of secondary gout. This painful condition will cause the patient to refer back to the doctor or the pharmacist. The condition can appear within days of starting a thiazide diuretic and the GP will have little option but to change such patients onto an alternative diuretic and manage the inflammation.
<p>
<br>

<h3>Drug interactions</h3>
Diuretics as a drug class are involved in a number of interactions with other drug groups. Taken concomitantly with ACE inhibitors and antihypertensive agents (alpha-blockers and calcium channel blockers) they enhance the hypotensive effect. When taken in conjunction with NSAIDs (most notably indomethacin), oestrogens or a progestogen, there is an antagonism of the diuretic effect and a greater possibility of hypokalaemia with potassium-sparing diuretics.
<p>
When lithium salts are taken in combination with thiazide and loop diuretics, there are increased plasma lithium concentrations with the risk of toxicity.
<p>
The following drugs, when taken in combination with thiazides, increase the risk of hyperkalaemia: anti-arrhythmic agents, alpha-blockers, corticosteroids, sympathomimetics and the ulcer-healing drug carbenoxolone.
<p>
<br>

<h3>Inappropriate use</h3>
Diuretics are over-prescribed in the elderly. They are used at too high a dose, for too long and are often used for inappropriate indications, such as gravitational oedema, which usually responds to activity such as walking. Lack of monitoring in this age group results in the appearance of more side-effects and pharmacists play a useful role in being alert and referring to the GP where appropriate.
<p>
Diuretics are also used by women to relieve fluid retention often associated with hormonal changes in the menstrual cycle. Some women use diuretics in the misguided notion that they reduce weight. Pharmacists should be alert to this abuse and discourage it.

Eating disorders lead to a lifestyle in which eating or not totally dominates a person's thinking. Yet starving or binge eating are not just about food but are symptoms of underlying emotional and psychological distress. It can be a way to avoid facing painful issues, or of exerting control when you feel other people are running your life. It can also be a reaction to unresolved stress, possibly going back many years to childhood traumas.
<P>
Eating disorders have one of the highest mortality rates of all psychiatric illnesses. Over 10 per cent of sufferers die, either from starvation or as a result of suicide.
<P>
The starting point is often a desire to lose weight, but obviously not all slimmers develop eating disorders. The trigger may be unhappiness and emotional difficulty. Dr Bob Palmer, consultant psychiatrist at the Leicester General Hospital, says the reasons why people decide to slim may be complex and indicate more than a dissatisfaction with body shape. In his booklet, 'Understanding eating disorders', he explains how people who restrict their food intake can get caught up in a vicious circle in which fear of failure traps them into developing anorexia or bulimia. But the reasons why some people are more susceptible than others is unclear.
<P>
Family influences seem to play a part, but again their exact role is not known. Both anorexia and bulimia tend to run in families, although the evidence for a genetic link is stronger with anorexia. Children also learn about eating behaviour and attitudes from their parents.
<P>
There is great social pressure to be slim and attractive, although Dr Palmer believes the influence of fashion, advertising and the media is not enough on its own to explain why some women develop eating disorders but most do not. Athletes, models and dancers who need to keep their weight down are particularly prone.
<P>
Most sufferers have a low self-esteem and many find it difficult to express their emotions. It is a myth, says Dr Palmer, that anorexia is a problem of the so-called upper and middle classes and that those with bulimia are ''striving, upwardly mobile types who live life in the fast lane''.
<P>
People with eating disorders are often afraid to ask for help or feel they do not want to be helped. But the sooner the problem is recognised, the better the long-term prognosis, although recovery may take a long time. Only about half those diagnosed as having an eating disorder have recovered after five years.
<P>
The Royal College of Psychiatrists estimates that at least 60,000 people are known to be suffering from anorexia and bulimia at any one time. The Eating Disorders Association suggests that the true figure is nearer 150,000-200,000.
There are two main eating disorders - anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa.
<P><br>

<H3>Anorexia nervosa</H3>
Anorexia is a relentless pursuit of thinness through starvation and a fear of becoming fat. Anorexics are not trying to starve themselves to death but are attempting to cope with living. Sufferers are terrified of being out of control; weight loss is one area of their lives they can regulate.
<P>
The peak age for anorexia nervosa is in the mid to late teens, although symptoms are being seen increasingly in children as young as eight, and it can occur for the first time in women in their 30s or later. It is much more common in females than males. The sex ratio is between 9:1 and 20:1.
<P>
The main symptoms of anorexia nervosa are:

<LI>severe weight loss
<LI>a distorted body image - people believe they are fat when they are dangerously thin
<LI>excessive exercising
<LI>amenorrhoea
<LI>insomnia
<LI>irritability
<LI>feelings of worthlessness
<LI>symptoms of starvation - severe constipation, abdominal pain, dizziness, swollen stomach, face and ankles
<LI>secret vomiting/purging
<LI>growth of downy hair on the body.


Eventually, loss of weight can lead to electrolyte imbalance, circulatory problems, infertility, osteoporosis and kidney failure.
<P><br>

<H3>Treatment of anorexia</H3>
Treatment concentrates on trying to resolve emotional difficulties and establish a more settled pattern of eating. Pressurising an anorexic into eating can cause rebellion and further relapse. To tell a sufferer she looks well or to congratulate her on gaining weight may prompt her to start dieting again in case she gets fat. 
<P>
Starvation also results in a decreased metabolic rate, so the sufferer tends to put weight on rapidly at first until the metabolism returns to normal. This, too, can prompt fears of uncontrolled weight gain.
<P>
It may take many months for the patient to restore their weight and learn to keep this weight. Psychotherapy tries to help the patient feel safe enough to change and should certainly continue after the weight is regained. Weight recovery by itself does not constitute a cure. 
<P>
Hospital admission may be necessary if the patient feels unable to change without constant support. On the other hand, they might resent going into hospital as it makes them feel even more out of control.
<P>
Some psychiatric hospitals or departments have units specialising in the treatment of eating disorders. Self-help groups, details of which are available from the Eating Disorders Association, also play a useful part in rehabilitation.
<P>
As for drug treatment, Dr Jill Welbourne of the Eating Disorders Clinic, Bristol Royal Infirmary, says: ''The proper treatment for anorexia is food - either solid food or liquid supplements. Many doctors get carried away with antidepressants, but overlook the bread and cheese. Of course, anorexics get anxious, depressed and sleepless, so the judicious use of tranquillisers, antidepressants and hypnotics is helpful. But the metabolism of patients who have adapted to starvation is often unpredictable.''
<P>
As absorption is impaired, it could take eight hours for a drug to act. Giving another dose in the meantime could lead to serious problems when both doses are finally absorbed. Starved patients are more sensitive to bone marrow depression with drugs such as chlorpromazine. Similarly, they are more sensitive to the disinhibiting effects of diazepam, becoming extremely unrealistic and feeling they can 'float off balconies'. This is something pharmacists could warn about if they are dispensing for anorexic patients.
<P><br>

<H3>Bulimia nervosa</H3>
Bulimia nervosa is a condition in which sufferers eat exceptionally large amounts of food in a short time then try to rid themselves of it by vomiting, laxatives, diuretics or starvation. One diagnostic criterion is that over-eating must be occurring at least twice a week for at least three months - it is not just a single over-indulgence. The sufferer's life becomes dominated by thoughts of shopping, cooking, bingeing then getting rid of food. 
<P>
Bulimia tends to occur later than anorexia, typically in the late teens and early 20s, and is uncommon under the age of 15 years. The peak age of onset (16-18 years) is a time when many young people are leaving home or moving from school to higher education.
<P>
As with anorexia nervosa, there is an excessive fear of being too fat, although body weight may be high, low or average because of the balance between bingeing and restraint.
<P>
People with bulimia may appear to have more normal eating habits than those with anorexia nervosa, as their problem is more easily kept secret. Symptoms also include:

<LI>feeling guilty, helpless, lonely and out of control
<LI>menstrual disturbances
<LI>sore throat and tooth decay through regular vomiting
<LI>dehydration and poor skin
<LI>mood swings
<LI>secretive behaviour.

Other effects in the long-term include general digestive problems, throat ulcers, enlarged salivary glands, electrolyte imbalance, bowel damage from laxative abuse, kidney and heart failure.
<P><br>

<H3>Treatment of bulimia</H3>
The main treatment is short-term psychotherapy, usually cognitive-behavioural therapy in which the therapist works with the patient to reduce undesirable behaviour, such as bingeing and vomiting, and to establish more normal eating patterns. Treatment is usually on an outpatient basis, although hospital admission may be necessary if bulimia is complicated by other problems, such as excessive drinking or self-mutilating behaviour. Generally it is better for sufferers to learn to change their own behaviour instead of it being imposed on them.
<P>
Antidepressants may help if bulimia is accompanied by clinical depression. Prozac, in doses higher than those used for clinical depression (60mg daily), seems to reduce the urge to binge. A recent study (Goldstein et al, 1995, BJ Psych 166:660-66) concluded that at these doses, for up to 16 weeks, fluoxetine was safe and effective. It seemed to improve patients' quality of life because they felt their eating was more in control and they were less preoccupied with thinness. Fluoxetine may cause weight loss, but the data sheet says that only rarely has the drug been withdrawn for this reason in depressed or bulimic patients.
<P>
A practical guide to the treatment of bulimia nervosa, based on patients keeping diaries and monitoring their own eating patterns, was outlined by Christopher Freeman in the Journal of Psychosomatic Research (1991, 35, Suppl 1, 41-49). He used fluoxetine mainly when measures such as behaviour therapy, cognitive therapy and self-help groups had failed.
<P>
If side-effects were a problem with 60mg in the morning, he found that just 20mg at 6.00pm could help because the main bingeing times were in the evening. The antibulimic effects could take over 10-14 days to develop and treatment should be continued until patients were eating relatively normally and had considerably changed their attitudes to bingeing and vomiting.
<P>
He suggested there was little or no place for the conventional tricyclics or MAOIs in treating bulimia nervosa except in clear-cut depressive illness accompanied by bulimia. Many of these drugs caused weight gain, which was particularly distressing. He thought that, as serotonin was intimately connected with control of feeding, behaviour and appetite, the use of highly-specific serotonin re-uptake blockers could be an important development.
<P>
Dr Jill Welbourne agrees that fluoxetine is not a first-line treatment but can be useful at a later stage as an adjunct to counselling and educational programmes, providing it is given at the recommended dose of 60mg.
<P><br>

<H3>How to help</H3>
So what can pharmacists do to help? Margaret Duncum of the Eating Disorders Association, says: ''People with eating disorders can be very secretive and reluctant to make themselves vulnerable to pharmacists for advice. But it would be useful if pharmacies displayed our leaflets and poster, which explain where they can get help.''
<P>
Anxious parents might ask for ways of making ordinary foods more nutritious by adding high calorie supplements.
<P>
''This is a difficult area as it has to be done without the patient's knowledge,'' she warns. But it is worth referring the parent to the GP for advice; although high energy and modular supplements are not specified as Borderline Substances for the treatment of anorexia, GPs may prescribe them for ''disease-related malnutrition''.
<P>
Dr Welbourne says carers might find it easier to persuade patients to take high-energy supplements than food, as supplements may seem more like medicines.
<P>
''It might be easier to say 'Here is your medicine' than to have a battle over eating up the stew and greens,'' she says.
Over the counter supplements of calcium and vitamin D may give useful protection against osteoporosis while the body weight is low, she adds.
<P><br>

<H3>OTC abuse</H3>
Dr Welbourne also warns pharmacists to be on the look-out for people who could be overdosing on sleeping aids such as diphenhydramine.
<P>
''They are not intending to commit suicide but are trying to become unconscious so they do not binge,'' she explains.
Youngsters who buy large quantities of OTC diuretics should also arouse suspicion. And excessive use of ginseng can be dangerous to someone who is not eating, particularly if taken with lots of black coffee.
<P>
Pharmacists can also watch out for laxative abuse and help patients give up these products. Many abusers do not appreciate that laxatives do not cause weight loss because calories are quickly absorbed. Laxatives simply cause dehydration and loss of important vitamins, minerals and electrolytes.
<P>
The EDA has a 'Coming off laxatives' advice sheet, which suggests that people who have been taking laxatives for a short while should try to stop at once. Other people may find a gradual approach is better, say, a 10 per cent reduction a week or keeping certain days of the week laxative-free.
<P>
They should try to increase the amount of fibre in their diet by eating high-fibre foods rather than large amounts of bran.
'Don't panic if you become constipated,' the leaflet states. 'Rebound constipation is a common, but not inevitable, side-effect of laxative abuse and will ease with time and with a healthy and normal-sized diet.'
<P>
Some people find their weight increases when they stop taking laxatives or they feel bloated, but this is only temporary. 
Another EDA leaflet, 'Bulimia and your teeth', explains that stomach acid washing over the teeth (through frequent vomiting) wears away the enamel. Many sufferers make the mistake of brushing their teeth after being sick, which increases the risk of erosion. <P>
Instead they should rinse the mouth thoroughly with water, then wait several hours before brushing or eating anything acidic, such as fruit. If they feel compelled to brush immediately, they should avoid toothpaste and just use water.
<P>
Dr Welbourne advises rinsing with a dilute solution of sodium bicarbonate and then using a weak fluoride mouthwash intended for daily use.

<br><br>



The two-part article will be looking at coryza (the common cold) - its symptoms, pathophysiology and management. Although the public see coughs as part and parcel of the cold infection, the inclusion of a cough is just a reflection that the disease is multisymptomatic.
<p>
<br>
<H3>Incidence</H3> 
Coryza, one of the most common acute minor ailments, is rarely serious and accounts for many lost working days. The incidence varies with age, being more frequent in infants (as many as six episodes per year in the up to six-year-olds), and decreasing with age as individuals develop a more efficient immune system.
<P>
The incidence of a cold varies with the time of the year, having three peaks in autumn, winter and early spring. In the UK, 66 per cent of adults state they had a cold in the past year: practitioners will not be surprised by this figure. The PAGB survey shows that 15 per cent of adults had a cold in the last two weeks, which may be compared to the 27 per cent of children under 15 years old. 
<p>
<br>
<H3>Pathophysiology</H3>
Coryza is an upper respiratory tract infection caused by a virus. Over 200 viruses, including rhinoviruses, coronoviruses, adenoviruses, echo viruses, parainfluenza viruses 1-4 have been shown to cause the common cold. The first two listed account for about 50-60 per cent of all attacks. 
<P>
Cold viruses enter the body through the nasal mucus membranes. Following penetration, they shed their coat, release their nucleic acid and replicate. The incubation period varies according to the specific virus involved: about one to two days for the rhinoviruses, three to four days for the coronoviruses. As the virus spreads, the body produces an inflammatory reaction in target organs.
<P>
The cold viruses target organ is the respiratory epithelium. This results in oedema, and increased secretion and the release of inflammatory mediators (including histamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine). The major target organ is specific for each virus. This accounts for the different types and sequences of symptoms that each cold attack displays.  
<p>
<br>
<H3>Patient presentation</H3>
Because the condition is multisymptomatic, patients present with a wide variety of symptoms, including a sore throat, a cough and a runny or congested nose. Since influenza may have serious consequences for some patients, it is essential to distinguish between the two in certain situations (see below).
<P>
The frequency of cold attacks and their multisymptomatic nature may result in practitioners not paying sufficient attention to patient presentations. It is important that pharmacists and their medicine counter assistants are aware of any potentially serious condition, which may present as one of the cold symptoms (Table 1).
<p>
<br>
<H3>Questions to ask</H3>
<STRONG>Diagnosis</STRONG>
<li>What are the symptoms?
<li>How long have you had the problem?
<li>How have the symptoms changed?
<li>Do you have a frontal headache?
<li>Have you been abroad within the last year (in case of malaria)?
<li>Do you have swollen neck or axillary glands?
<li>Do you have a sore throat; are you taking any medication for it?
<li>Do you suffer from allergies?
<li>What is your temperature?
<br><STRONG>Management</STRONG>
<li>Which major symptom do you wish to relieve?
<li>Is the cough productive/non-productive?
<li>Any earache involvement?
<li>Do you have hypertension, glaucoma, urinary problems or thyroid problems?
<p>
<br>
<H3>Diagnosis</H3>
The pathophysiology of coryza indicates that each specific virus has its own major target organ. Also, there appears to be a sequence of different target organs which are attacked in differing order for each virus. The major target organs are the throat, nose and lung. Problems may be experienced in the eyes and ears and a slight general malaise may be present. 
<P>
In view of this complex presentation, the region and symptoms associated with that location can best be considered together. The lungs are, strictly speaking, part of the lower respiratory tract.
<P>
<li><STRONG>Symptom complex/region sore throat:</STRONG> a sore throat is frequently the first symptom of a cold. A dry, scratchy feeling may be reported. Remember that a sore throat without other symptoms may be caused by more serious pathologies and care must be taken to exclude these. 
<P>
In the later stages, catarrh may be experienced. This is the result of post-nasal drip. Post-nasal drip is the nasal mucus dripping down from the back of the nose to collect in the tonsil area, causing discomfort. The discharge may become infected with a secondary bacterial attack. 
<P>
<STRONG>Runny/congested nose</STRONG>: the problem starts with the production of a large quantity of thin watery mucus. With time the mucus thickens and nasal congestion then becomes the problem.
<P>
<STRONG>Cough/chest:</STRONG> coughs are frequently presented as the prime symptom. They may be either productive (mucus in chest, with or without expectoration) or non-productive (no mucus in chest) and may change from one to the other over a period of time.
<P>
Caution should be exercised in assessing whether a cough is non-productive as many patients will report a cough as dry if they do not expectorate, even if phlegm (mucus) is present. Secondary bacterial infection may occur with the mucus becoming yellow, green or brown.
<P>
Tracheitis, inflammation of the trachea, may cause a dry cough due to the increased sensitivity. This condition may or may not be associated with a cold. The cough is most pronounced when the patient moves from one environment to another, exemplified by going from inside a house to the colder air outside.
<P>
Note that measles has prodomal features, which include pyrexia, a dry cough and general malaise. The typical rash may not appear until the third day.
<P>
<STRONG>Headache: </STRONG>a common problem associated with a cold is sinusitis (see part two of the article), which may be presented as a headache.
<P>
<STRONG>Earache: </STRONG>as the pathophysiology of coryza includes oedema of nasal and throat tissue with increased secretions in these areas, it is not surprising that the eustachian tube may become obstructed. This may result in slight hearing loss and a specific sensation reported as an echo or 'wax or water in the ear'. 
<P>
Pain in the ear may be due to bacterial infection. Such pain will be continuous and hearing loss may not be present. These patients must be referred.
<P>
<STRONG>Runny eye:</STRONG> eye problems are only rarely reported with a cold. Allergic rhinitis is a more common cause of eye involvement, but sometimes eyes become 'hot' and watery with coryza. Conjunctivitis due to bacterial infection of the excess watery secretions, which cannot drain due to nasolacrimal blockage, is common especially in infants and children.
<P>
<STRONG>General malaise/pyrexia:</STRONG> viral infections produce a general feeling of being unwell, but with a cold this is usually mild. Similarly, pyrexia may develop, again mild and not above 38deg C. If there is more severe malaise and the temperature is greater than 38.5deg C then influenza should be considered.
<P>
<li><STRONG>Universal factors</STRONG> Although colds are more prevalent during autumn, early winter and spring, they can occur at other times throughout the year, thus their seasonality has little significance in diagnosis. Influenza is normally episodic and this may provide a clue to the patient's condition.
<P>
Cold viruses are spread to a new host by direct contact, usually hand contact. The viruses are carried in respiratory secretions, such as those expelled during a cough or sneeze. Surprisingly, airborne transmission via droplets is less efficient, as is saliva contact. Cold weather itself is not a significant factor in transmission, nor are wet feet or reduced body temperature, as is often thought. However, local environmental temperature variation induces vasomotor responses in the nasal membranes, increasing watery secretion, making these cells more permeable to the virus.
<P>
Although there is no clear evidence that emotional stress, poor nutrition or general poor health contribute to a cold attack, the elderly are more prone to infection, possibly because of the latter of these factors.
<P>
<li><STRONG>Time/intensity</STRONG> The symptoms of a cold are usually mild. Slight malaise and pyrexia may be present. However, patients may not agree that these symptoms, along with the cough and problems with the nose, are insignificant. More serious malaise and pyrexia indicate influenza. 
<P>
It is said that a cold lasts '14 days with treatment and two weeks without'. This timescale is not that far out. However, some colds last up to three weeks and unless the patient is at either end of the age spectrum or in some way compromised, this should not cause concern.
<P>
<li><STRONG>Natural history</STRONG> The natural history of a cold is significant. A typical cold starts with a sore throat, which lasts for about two days. This progresses to a runny nose with a slight general malaise. Coughs associated with colds frequently start as unproductive, the cough being a result of pharyngeal irritation. This may be described as a dry, tickly cough. The cough gradually changes to be productive and patients find it easy to expectorate as the phlegm is fluid. 
<P>
The next stage is frequently a gradual thickening of nasal mucus giving rise to a blocked nose. By this time the patient may well feel better (the malaise having subsided) but nasal congestion and the cough become troublesome, especially as the phlegm becomes more viscous. Catarrh is common at this stage and this, together with a productive cough, may continue for two to three weeks.
<P>
<li><STRONG>Your current medication</STRONG>
The majority of cold symptoms are not the result of current medication. There are two exceptions to this, a dry cough caused by ACE inhibitors and a runny nose due to overuse of local sympathomimetic amines in the nose (rhinitis medicamentosa). The latter is also known as rebound congestion

Inhaler devices deliver drugs directly to where they are needed, yet poor compliance is a major cause of treatment failure in asthma. Dr Martin Johnson, a general practitioner with a special interest in asthma, based at the Ashville Medical Centre, Barnsley, gives an overview of the devices available and looks at how pharmacists can help patients improve inhaler technique

Asthma is a disease of the lungs and airways, so the most obvious and direct route for delivering drugs to treat the condition is by inhalation. This provides direct delivery to the site of action in the airways and a way to achieve rapid response to bronchodilator drugs. Inhalation also enables lower doses of drugs to be used than if they were taken by mouth, reducing the risk of systemic side-effects.
<P>
Inhaled therapy has been used for a long time. Hippocrates was supposed to have prescribed the first inhalation device over 3,000 years ago, but things have come a long way since then. The metered dose inhaler, developed in the 1950s, is still the most commonly-used asthma device, but a wide range of devices exists today.
<P>
It is vital that the inhaler is matched carefully to the patient's needs and abilities. The priority is to ensure that patients are given an inhaler they can and will use, otherwise all efforts are wasted. Ideally, the health professional would be able to monitor whether the device is being used and used correctly.
<P>
<br>
<H3>Inhaler device types</H3>
The actual dose of medication reaching the lungs from most inhaler devices (used by themselves) is only about 10 per cent of that delivered. Much of the drug is lost in the device, while some particles are too large to reach the lungs, impacting instead on the back of the throat, with the potential for system absorption. This is particularly important for inhaled steroids. 
<P>
However, even though the lung dose delivery is relatively low, drug delivery by inhalation is usually highly effective if the correct technique is used.
<P>
There are four basic types of inhaler available, each with specific advantages and disadvantages, making them suitable for certain groups of patients.<P>

<P>
<br>

<CENTER><STRONG>Which inhalation device for which patient?</STRONG><br>

<TD><EM>(based on: Asthma, P J Barnes, S Godfrey, M Dunitz, 1995)</EM></TD><TR>

</TABLE></center>


<p>
<br>
<H3>Metered dose </H3>
Metered dose inhalers (MDIs) contain medication mixed with a propellant. A controlled dose is emitted as a spray when the device is activated. The advantages of MDIs are that they are quick to use, small and portable, and relatively cheap.
<P>
However, there are several disadvantages with MDIs. Research has shown that around 50 per cent of patients using an MDI experience problems1. Perfect technique is essential for correct drug delivery. This can be quite difficult to achieve, requiring good co-ordination between activating the device and inhalation. Because of this, it is considered that MDIs are generally unsuitable for children under the age of about six and for many elderly patients or those with problems such as arthritis, which can impair manual dexterity. The education and subsequent reinforcement required for MDIs is considerable.
<P>
Another problem with MDIs is that the cold jet of propellant can irritate the throat, which in turn causes coughing. Also, many MDIs contain chlorofluorocarbon propellants (CFCs), which are now banned because of their effect on the ozone layer - alternative 'environmentally-friendly' propellants are now being introduced.
<P>
Newer types of MDIs, which are breath-actuated, release the drug when the patient breathes in. These require less co-ordination than traditional MDIs, but do require a certain level of inspiratory flow rate.
<p>
<br>
<H3>Spacer options</H3> 
Metered dose inhalers with spacers provide an option for patients who are unable to co-ordinate well enough to use an MDI correctly. Spacers are essentially holding chambers that are connected to the MDI. The drug is released from the MDI into the spacer, from where the patient can inhale. Spacers are available with face masks, which make them suitable to use with babies.
<P>
Using a spacer means that co-ordination is no longer so important and enables MDIs to be used by patients of all ages. They may reduce systemic absorption by ensuring that the drug is inhaled into the lungs rather than the stomach. Spacers may also be effective even in severe asthma. However, the disadvantages of spacers are that they are bulky, so inconvenient to carry about. The valves can sometimes stick or become incompetent.
<P>
There has been a great deal of controversy about whether the larger spacers are interchangeable between different makes of MDI. There are problems using spacers designed for use with specific products; for example, the Volumatic with a generic salbutamol inhaler, as these have not been developed to be used together. It is important that the right spacer is used with the right inhaler. There may be legal implications for both the prescriber and the pharmacist. Generally, it is best to follow manufacturers' instructions on choice of spacer and MDI to be used together.
<p>
<br>
<H3>Dry powder devices </H3>
Dry powder devices are activated by the patient's inspiratory effort so co-ordination is not a problem, although inhalation technique is still important. The drug is aerosolised by the airflow through a DPI created by the patient inhaling. They are easy to use and so are suitable for most ages. Newer multidose types of powder device, such as the Accuhaler, have a dose counter, which enables patients to check whether or not they have taken a dose and warns them when the inhaler is running out of doses by showing them exactly how many doses remain.
<P>
One disadvantage of dry powder devices is that patients need to be able to inspire reasonably rapidly to inhale the dry powder so these devices are not suitable for some younger children (under-fives, generally).
<p>
<br>
<H3>Nebuliser use</H3>
Nebulisers produce a cloud of medication by passing a jet of compressed air through a solution of the drug (jet nebulisers) or by dropping the drug solution onto a plate vibrating at high frequency (ultrasonic nebulisers).
<P>
Preparations of bronchodilators, sodium cromoglycate and steroids are available for use in nebulisers.Nebulisers have several advantages - co-ordination is unimportant so they can be used by patients of all ages, including young babies; nebulised therapy is effective in severe asthma, so is often used to treat acute exacerbations.
<P>
Disadvantages of nebulisers include the fact that they are cumbersome, expensive (both the machine and the drugs), noisy and treatment takes a long time - often around ten minutes. All these factors tie the patient down.
<p>
<br>
<H3>Match-making</H3>
Matching the inhaler to the patient's requirements is highly important because the right choice will improve compliance and so achieve optimal asthma control.
<P>
Features of inhalation devices which may aid compliance:
<li>easy to use
<li>reliable, delivering reproducible doses
<li>portable
<li>range of therapies and strengths available
<li>dose monitoring to indicate whether dose has been taken and number of doses left 
<li>aesthetically pleasing/unobtrusive
<li>acceptable cost
<P>
Poor compliance with asthma medication is a major problem, which can result in exacerbations of asthma symptoms and increased consultations. If a patient finds their device difficult to use or awkward to carry about, then he or she will fail to benefit from the treatment and feel that is doing no good. They may then stop taking the drug altogether, risking deterioration of asthma control, which may lead to a serious attack requiring hospitalisation. Many of the 1,800-2,000 deaths every year from asthma are caused by undertreatment.
<P>
For many patients and parents of asthmatic children the ability to check whether they have taken the dose and how many doses have been taken makes dose monitoring an important asset in asthma devices. Thus using a device with a dose monitoring facility can lead to an improvement in compliance.
<P>
Children aged 4-11 in my practice recently took part in a study comparing steroid use from a dry powder device with a dose counter (the Accuhaler) with a more traditional device lacking this facility. Encouragingly, more than 90 per cent of them found the Accuhaler 'very easy' or 'easy' to use. A similar high proportion thought it was important to be able to tell how many doses were left in their inhalers2.
<P>
The aesthetic appearance of a device is also important, particularly to teenagers. Some patients prefer dry powder devices as they can be operated unobtrusively without making a noise. Once a device has been found which suits a patient, it is best if all the asthma drugs they require - which may include a bronchodilator for symptom relief and a corticosteroid for preventing inflammation leading to asthma attacks - can be given by the same type of device.
<P>
This can be achieved with several devices; for example, the Accuhaler is available for salbutamol, salmeterol and fluticasone, and the Turbohaler for terbutaline and budesonide. It is also useful to give patients two or three inhalers for each medication so they can keep them in different places, perhaps one at home and one at work.
<p>
<br>
<H3>Teaching techniques </H3>
Teaching patients to use their inhalers correctly is crucial, otherwise most of the drug will be lost into the device, the air or in the patients stomach. Health professionals, including pharmacists, looking after asthma patients should ideally be able to explain how to use and demonstrate correctly all the different devices available (see guidelines below).
<P>
Calls from patients to the National Asthma Campaign information line show that many patients find their asthma devices difficult to use. They often feel awkward about going back to their doctor or practice nurse, especially if that involves waiting for an appointment. In these situations, an interested and well informed pharmacist can really help by checking that someone is using their inhaler correctly, or in suggesting they go back to their GP if there is a major problem.
<P>
Pharmacists are also a major source of help in issuing emergency supplies for patients who run out of their treatment and need a replacement inhaler immediately. This could potentially be a life-saving service.
<P>
Pharmacists also have a vital part to play in checking the prescriptions of people with asthma. Certain common drugs, such as aspirin, ibuprofen and beta-blockers (both eye drops and tablets), are dangerous to patients with asthma. Pharmacists who know their regular customers or who keep records of prescriptions collected are often able to spot when someone has inadvertently requested a prescription which may be inappropriate.
<P>
Patient education is a central part of good asthma management. This is an area in which pharmacists can really help by explaining some of the basics which people soon forget after leaving the GP's surgery. It may be helpful for pharmacies to stock some patient leaflets on asthma.

 There is growing interest in complementary therapies, particularly traditional medicines. In some ethnic cultures, the use of natural products as medicines is firmly based in written and oral tradition. For about 80 per cent of the world's population traditional medicines are the only accessible treatment. 
<P>
In China, the use of vegetable (including herbal) drugs to treat disease was first described in the 'Inner Classic of the Yellow Emperor' (300-100BC). During the past 15-20 years, traditional Chinese herbal medicine practitioners in the UK have had remarkable success in treating eczema and serious skin disease which have been too severe to treat with corticosteroids.
<P>
<br>
<H3>Principles </H3>
Chinese herbal medicine is part of a broader branch of medicine, called Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), from which shiatsu and acupuncture have evolved.
<P>
Diagnosis and treatment is based on different principles from those in the West and diseases are perceived as syndrome complexes, not as single clinical entities. There are references to Chinese philosophy, arts, astronomy, religion and ethical codes, all combined into a unified concept of health and disease. 
<P>
The end product - the medicine - is effective for use  even in serious disease and is now being subjected to the gold standard of controlled clinical trials to establish safety and efficacy. TCM follows the principles laid out below:<br>
<li><STRONG>Chi and meridians</STRONG> TCM believes a finite amount of energy, chi, circulates our body through invisible channels called meridians. Chi can be depleted by certain lifestyles and stresses leading to disease.
<li><STRONG>Yin and yang</STRONG> Disease is perceived as a disharmony in the balance between yin and yang - opposite yet complementary aspects which regulate bodily systems. 
<li><STRONG>The five elements</STRONG> TCM believes the universe is made of the five elements: wood, fire, earth, metal/air and water. These form our dynamic energetic relationships - orbits of function - with the different components of the human body. When well tuned, the orbits of function are associated with good health, but when in disharmony, they lead to disease. 
<li><STRONG>Plant medicines</STRONG> Another characteristic of TCM is the use of various plant-derived  medicines, such as flowers, roots and stems. Although Chinese medicines are normally brewed as a tea, other formulations, such as granules, pastes and tablets, also exist. 
<P>
<br>
<H3>Application</H3>
During a consultation, the practitioner takes a detailed case history, examines the presenting condition and looks at other factors affecting the disease, until a pattern of disharmony is established. The practitioner then chooses from a range of materia medica to construct a prescription. By constructing a bespoke prescription for each patient, TCM practitioners achieve a high level of therapeutic benefit. 
<P>
TCM appears to be particularly effective in certain conditions and diseases. One example is immune system dysfunction. Orthodox medicine is currently less than satisfactory and often involves the use of corticosteroids and immune suppressants, by default.
<P>
<br>
<H3>Mode of action</H3>
The success of TCM makes investigating mode of action a stimulating challenge. For many years, the way in which anaesthesia is produced by acupuncture was unknown but can now be understood in terms of the release of endorphins by stimulation of specific nerve tracts or meridians.
<P>
The mode of action of Chinese herbal medicine is based on immunology and pharmacodynamics. 'Complex' prescriptions contain a number of botanical species: some, like liquorice, are known in Western pharmacopoeias, others, like peony, rehmannia (Chinese foxglove) and dittany, are related to ornamental species in the West. Others are exotic species which only grow in South East Asia. 
<P>
These 'complex' prescriptions contain a hierarchy of component vegetable drugs, which include principal agents as well as additive/synergistic components to reduce toxicity. Attempts to take apart a prescription to identify the active component have so far shown that the total prescription is greater than the sum of the parts.
<P>
Establishing mode of action and active substances therefore is not a priority when trying to explain efficacy. Chinese practitioners would claim that in seeking a specific active constituent we are asking the wrong question. A first priority has been to demonstrate that the medicine works and is safe under the controlled conditions of clinical studies in Western hospitals. 
<P>
The question to ask is what standardised formulas could be used to provide benefit to a majority of patients in a defined therapeutic category, so that the Western disciplines of statistical evaluation of a controlled trial could be brought to bear.
<P>
<br>
<H3>Quality control</H3>
For Western standards of quality control to be used it is necessary to look in terms of quality, safety and efficacy. One way this can be done is by carrying out instrumental tests, such as thin layer chromatography, which gives a characteristic fingerprint. Where the active ingredient is not known, it is possible to provide reassurance on quality by using marker substances.
<P>
While the aim of the research is to define a molecule that is responsible for the useful clinical activity, it is also possible to provide instrumental data showing consistency and stability from batch to batch. However, it should be noted that climate, horticultural factors, harvesting, processing and storage conditions may all affect batch consistency. 
<P>
TCM is based on careful clinical observation. The window of safety of efficacy which has been defined serves to regulate the doses and conditions under which TCMs are used. Unfortunately, this type of evaluation and surveillance is not sufficient to justify the unregulated use of TCM in Western medicine and it is necessary to provide objective data on quality, safety and efficacy.
<P>
One pharmaceutical company, Phytopharm, is committed to research into this field and has found that TCM does work in major therapeutic areas and there is a satisfactory risk/benefit ratio. To ensure high standards Phytopharm has devised an instrumental regime of quality control tests which complement the Good Manufacturing Practice standards for the preparation of products.
<P>
<br>
<H3>Zemaphyte</H3>
The first product to be studied and trialled by Phytopharm according to Western principles is Zemaphyte (trademark), a standardised formulation of ten herbs which is widely used in Chinese medicinal plants to treat people with severe, steroid-resistant atopic eczema.
<P>
Although the majority of cases of eczema are mild and respond satisfactorily to simple topical treatments, in a significant number of cases the disease is more troublesome and, at its worst, may require hospitalisation. This type of eczema is poorly treated with existing therapies and it was decided to carry out clinical studies at Great Ormond Street Hospital for Sick Children, the Royal Free Hospital and the Middlesex Hospital, which are all tertiary referral centres for the most severe type of eczema. 
<P>
A full-scale placebo-controlled clinical study was undertaken, and clinical studies have subsequently been carried out in other UK hospitals. The first trials with Zemaphyte, given either as a decoction or as taste-masked granules of dried decoction, showed a statistically highly-significant and clinically-important decrease in erythema and skin surface damage in groups of the most severely effected patients. 
<P>
The studies also provided information on safety of the treatment. The incidence of adverse events (mainly transient GI tract disturbance) has been about 15 per cent. The incidence of liver function test abnormalities was around 2 per cent. The adverse events are reversible when treatment is withdrawn and most cases are not considered severe. 
<P>
The definition of safety is important in establishing the treatment in an area of disease where the alternatives are associated with a high degree of adverse events, or a low ceiling of efficacy. Phytopharm has recently submitted a product licence application for this product to the Medicines Control Agency. Meanwhile, Zemaphyte is available on a named patient basis in granulated form.
<P>
<br>
<H3>Other TCM products</H3>
The positive response by clinicians, and the high degree of acceptance by patients, has encouraged Phytopharm to develop additional products based on TCM in skin disease. 
<P>
Possible modes of action have been explored3 and the investigative work has taken Phytopharm to the cutting edge of immunological science and investigation at a sub-cellular level. It has shown that Zemaphyte can inhibit the proliferation of low affinity IgE (CD23) receptors in Langerhans cells in the skin. However, the activity of Zemaphyte is limited to eczema with no effect on asthma or hayfever. 
<P>
In addition to its work in treatments for eczema, Phytopharm is looking at the treatment of psoriasis, and, more broadly, at wound healing, asthma, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis and Alzheimer's disease. These treatments come from a range of traditional medical cultures.
<P>
<br>
<H3>Qualified sceptics </H3>
There is some concern about the use of unstandardised TCM by practitioners who may or may not be adequately trained in their use. Pharmacognosy has disappeared from the pharmacy curriculum, and phytochemistry provides only part of the information required for an understanding of medicines derived from vegetable drugs.
<P>
The past 10-20 years has seen an almost exponential increase in the number of traditional medicine practitioners in Western Europe. Some are immigrants, others are being trained here by organisations such as the National Institute of Medicinal Herbalists (Middlesex University), which includes a section on TCM in its curriculum. A more comprehensive course is offered at the School of Chinese Medicine, based in Church Westcote, Oxfordshire. There is renewed interest in some of the schools of pharmacy for this area of research - which is where pharmacy started.
<P>
Western medicine, like TCM, is based on careful clinical observation and owes a great debt to TCM. It is fascinating that we now have the tools to explain some of the ways in which these treatments work in serious disease, nearly 3,000 years after they were first used.<P>

<br><br>




Diagnosis of coryza is not usually difficult, as was discovered in the first part of this article (C&D October 5), but its management can only provide symptomatic relief. There are four major symptoms which sufferers wish to relieve: general malaise with slight pyrexia, the cough, nasal problems and a sore throat. Before discussing these, it is essential to consider patient factors outlined by the mnemonic 'CARE'.
<P>
<LI>Chronic/Risk Group/Age
<br>	
As usual, all patients at either end of the age scale should be treated with caution. Although some authorities do not accept infants under six months can get a cold, there is no doubt that infants do get 'the snuffles' and they may be managed with simple remedies to relieve the major problem at that age: the blocked nose.
<P>
Teenagers suffering from a persistent sore throat and feeling 'poorly' may have glandular fever (infectious mononucleosis), especially if the glands in the neck, axilla and groin are enlarged. These patients should be referred.
<P>
The elderly have had considerable experience of cold symptoms and they are often in the best position to decide if referral is required. Ask if they feel the current attack is different from previous attacks; if it has lasted longer; if it is more severe; or if they are unhappy with their current condition. If so, they should be referred. 
<P>
Risk groups of patients include asthmatics, bronchitics, patients with emphysema and cystic fibrosis. This is because there is a possible decrease in lung efficiency in these patients. Management strategies may be influenced by patients with hypertension and diabetes.
<P>
<LI> Allergies
Sensitivity to aspirin is well established in some patients and should be considered when proposing drug treatment.
<P>
<LI> Reaction of proposed medication 
Reaction to some of the drugs used to relieve the general malaise and headache is significant. Aspirin and ibuprofen cause stomach irritation. Asthmatics should also avoid these. Some compound cough medicines contain antihistamines which cause idiosyncratic stimulation, especially in children. Sympathomimetic amines should not be taken shortly before bedtime as they can cause sleeplessness.
<P>
<LI> Establish patient preference 
There is a tremendous diversity of products marketed to relieve cold symptoms. Some are targeted to specific organs, while others have a broad spectrum of activity. Further-more, the pharmaceutical forms vary. 
<P>
Allow patients to select the product which most closely matches their wants: their needs are probably less important as colds are self-limiting minor ailments. As many cold remedies contain headache relieving drugs, it is important to establish potential interactions (see 'Headache', Pharmacy Update C&D July 6).
<P>
<H3>Product selection</H3>
It is not surprising that OTC medicines to relieve the symptoms of colds represent the largest category of sales, with a value in excess of 215 million (17 per cent of the entire OTC market) in 1994. There are four major concerns of sufferers: cough, nasal problems, sore throat and general malaise (with slight pyrexia). 
<P>
<H3>Cough</H3>
Non-productive coughs (about 20 per cent) are less common than productive and provide little benefit to body function. However, productive coughs remove unwanted material from the lungs. While it is reasonable to use cough suppressants for the non-productive cough, they should not be prescribed for productive coughs.

<P>
<LI> Suppressants: opiate derivatives codeine, pholcodine and dextromethorphan 
These act directly on the cough centre of the brain to depress the cough reflex. The major problems with opiate derivatives is the potential for addiction and constipation. Pholcodine and dextromethorphan are the drugs of choice. At the doses employed for cough suppression, little respiratory depression occurs.

<P>
<LI> Antihistamines: pheniramine, diphenhydramine, promethazine, triprolidine These owe their activity to their antimuscarinic, rather than their antihistaminic, effects. They partially exert their action by reducing stimulation of the cough reflex. Their antimuscarinic action also reduces bronchial and nasal secretions. Their sedative properties may be of benefit to some patients, especially to help induce sleep. Diphenhydramine is stated to have a direct suppressive action on the cough centre. Drug interactions and other problems are shown in Table 1. These compounds are also of value to relieve other cold symptoms (see later).
<P>
<LI> Expectorants: guaiphenesin, ammonium salts, ipecacuanha and others 
At high doses, all the expectorant drugs induce vomiting and it is postulated that at the lower dose they stimulate bronchial gland secretion. Thus their mode of action is reputed to be to increase watery secretion in the lung, reducing the viscosity of mucus, thus assisting the natural cough process which removes phlegm. Guaiphenesin has no contra-indications and therefore may be safely employed with patients with hypertension and diabetes.
<P>
<LI>Demulcents: glycerol, honey, syrup
These are reputed to act by coating the pharyngeal area, thus offering some protection against inhaled irritants. Their major effect may be the patient's belief that they soothe the cough (placebo effect), but as they are pharmacologically inert and may have a positive action, they have some use in management. Since they have a high carbohydrate content, caution should be exercised by diabetics. They are frequently in the form of pastilles or lozenges.
<P>
<LI>Decongestants
These are divided into sympathomimetics, bronchodilators and inhalations. 
Sympathomimetics include pseudoephedrine, phenylpropanolamine and ephedrine. While these agents are bronchodilators, their presence in cough mixtures is probably more related to their vasoconstrictor property. This results in decreased blood flow to the mucus membranes and thus reduces secretion, both in the nasal passages and the lung. For cough relief they are used systemically while local application is valuable for nasal problems (see later).
<P> 
Their vasoconstrictor action has a direct effect on blood pressure. Thus they are not suitable for hypertensive patients. Pseudoephedrine has been shown to have little effect on normotensive patients while ephedrine has the most marked pressor activity.
<P>
They all have a direct effect on metabolism and should not be taken by diabetics or those with thyroid problems (see Table 1).
Theophylline is a bronchodilator which is included in some OTC preparations. It causes smooth muscle relaxation but its mechanism of action is not fully understood. The concentration employed in OTC cough remedies may be sub-therapeutic for adults but because of the low dose they are safe. However, pharmacists should ensure the patient is not taking a xanthine from another (prescribed) source.
<P>
Inhalations can help productive coughs by reducing phlegm viscosity. There are two approaches to this: by increasing oral fluid intake or by inhalation. A cool moist mist or water vapour (cooled steam) are suitable and probably as pharmacologically effective for a cough as inhalations containing the terpenes. 
<P>
<H3>Nasal problems</H3>
Both congestion and a runny nose respond to the same therapeutic agents. In many cases, the same class of agent may be for either topical or systemic administration.
<P>
<LI> Sympathomimetics
Includes all those listed above plus phenylephrine. All the comments above apply to their use as systemic nasal decongestants. 
Preparations for local administration may also contain the metazolines. These act locally by vasoconstriction, reducing blood flow and thus secretions. They are absorbed, but the blood drug level is normally sufficiently low to preclude serious patient/drug interaction. Thus they may be used with caution by the mildly hypertensive and orally controlled diabetic. The one contra-indication is for patients concurrently taking MAOIs.
<P>
Continual usage (more than five to seven consecutive days) may produce rebound congestion. Dosing frequency with the longer-acting metazolines is twice or three times a day, while the shorter-acting ones require three to four applications daily. Sprays are preferred for adults as the force required for administration results in better penetration of the medication.
Selection of the oral or local administration route is mainly patient dependent. 
<P>
<LI> Antihistamines
Products as listed above. These reduce secretions through their antimuscarinic action. They are usually employed in combination cold relief products and the nasal activity is a side action of the drug.
<P>
<LI>Terpenes and volatile oils These are used as inhalations and, although there is little evidence to suggest they have any pharmacological activity on the lung, recent work suggests that they have some antimicrobial action and may have a complex role in such therapy. Their main role is thought to make the carrying of water vapour and droplets of inhalations more acceptable to the patient. This does not explain their use on their own (inhalation capsules).
<P>
<H3>Sore throat</H3>
The majority of sore throats (80 per cent) are viral in origin and no products currently available have a strong antiviral activity. Cold-related sore throats are also originally viral but secondary bacterial infection may occur. As sore throat preparations have little pharmacological action against the causative agent, there is little to choose between them. Recently, formulations containing local anaesthetics have been marketed. 
<P>
<LI> Antibacterial agents
The major agents are either phenols or surfactants. Povidone iodine has a broad antibacterial spectrum and some antiviral activity. It must not be used by thyroid patients or those who are sensitive to iodine.
<P>
<LI>Demulcents
Gelatine and glycerol form the basis of these types of products. 
<P>
<LI>Anaesthetics
Benzocaine, lignocaine and amethocaine are the major agents. Benzylamine may be used because of its anti-inflammatory effect.
Lozenges and pastilles provide a suitable method of administration and their major benefit, apart from the placebo effect, is that they stimulate salivary flow, which acts as a demulcent and soothes the pharynx.
<P>
Gargles, mouthwashes and sprays have little anti-infective effect. Gargles mechanically remove bacteria from the throat but the bacteria returns to its original level within the hour. Local anaesthetic sprays and gargles are available.
<P>
<H3>General malaise</H3>
The general feeling of being ill with a slightly raised temperature is common with the common cold. Treatment is with either aspirin, paracetamol or ibuprofen (see 'Headache' article, C&D July 6).
<P>
Minor headaches may occur in the initial stage of coryza but sinusitis is common. It is worth remembering the following points:
<P>
<LI>aspirin is not suitable for children under 12 years old
<P>
<LI>ibuprofen may provoke asthmatics to have an attack
laspirin and ibuprofen cause stomach irritation
<P>
<LI>paracetamol is present in many products: be cautious on the maximum daily dose.
<P>
<H3>Combined products</H3>
Many of the commercially available cough preparations are various mixtures of the above agents. Although modern preparations are less prone to illogical combinations, unfortunately many still exist. Thus the combination of an expectorant with a suppressant is clearly dubious.
<P> 
Some older preparations contain 'galenicals', such as squill extract, capsicum tincture, acetic acid, valerian extract, lobelia tincture and so on. There is little evidence to suggest they act in any way other than by their placebo effect.
<P>
Similarly, the majority of cold remedies take a polypharmacy approach. Many are sensible but the set drug dose ratio may be inappropriate. The frequently-used 500mg dose of paracetamol is too low: doubling the preparation dose may increase the concentration of other drugs present in the combination product to an unacceptable level. Caffeine is often added to produce some stimulation. 
<P>
Ascorbic acid is present in some cold remedies. The value of ascorbic acid is controversial. Some research suggests that low doses may stimulate the immune response. However, large doses, especially if in the effervescent form with sodium bicarbonate, may cause renal stones and alter blood sodium levels (caution in hypertension).

<P>
<H2>Tackling the complication of Sinusitis</H2>

While this is not strictly a direct result of a cold, it is frequently present in patients who have coryza. The two major facial sinuses (frontal and maxillary) may become inflamed and painful. 
<P>
<H3>Incidence</H3>
Sinusitis is a common condition, 16 per cent of adults stated that they had had it within the last year and 6 per cent had reported it within the last two-week period. There is no sex differentiation.
<P>
<H3>Causes</H3>
The pain is usually caused by either increased pressure within the sinus or inflammation of the sinus walls. Inflammation may be the result of either bacterial or viral attack.
<P>
<H3>Pathophysiology</H3>
The sinuses involved are spaces in the bones around the nose, cheeks and eyes. They are lined with mucus glands which produce about 800ml of fluid each day. This fluid usually drains from the sinus through a duct into the back of the nose. This duct may become obstructed when patients have a cold or hayfever, which results in reduced drainage. Pressure then builds up in the sinus leading to sensory nerve pain. Viral or bacterial invasion of the sinus results in inflammation with a similar result. Frequently, both events occur simultaneously, the latter as a result of the former.
<P>
<H3>Patient presentation</H3>
Sinusitis is often associated with other symptoms, including those of the common cold, allergic rhinitis (seasonal or perennial) and a blocked nose. Presentation of a headache associated with some of the other symptoms of a cold is not unusual. The location of the headache is crucial.<br>
<STRONG>Questions to ask</STRONG>
 Where is the headache?	
 Is the pain worse on bending down?
 Is there any purient discharge?
 Do you have any nasal congestion?
<P>
<H3>Diagnosis</H3>
<li><STRONG>Symptom complex</STRONG><br>
The prime symptom is the headache. Nasal congestion or, more rarely, a runny nose. Nasal problems are not always apparent. Sometimes a purient nasal discharge.
<li><STRONG>Region</STRONG><br>
Frontal sinus region: above and below the eyes.
<li><STRONG>Universal factors</STRONG><br>
Often associated with a cold or allergic rhinitis. Made worse by increased head blood pressure by bending down (head lower). Worse on waking up in morning (nasal congestion at worst and sinuses least likely to drain).
<li><STRONG>Time/intensity</STRONG><br>
May be so severe as to incapacitate the patient. Insidious onset and may continue until the nose problem is resolved.
<li><STRONG>Natural history</STRONG><br>
Onset with nasal problems, little change with time, may be worse in morning or when laying down.
<li><STRONG>Your current medication</STRONG><br>
Very few drugs will induce this problem.
<P>
<H3>Management</H3>
<li><STRONG>Chronic/Risk Group/Age</STRONG><br>
Patients at either end of the age scale.
<li><STRONG>Allergies</STRONG> <br>
Patients sensitive to aspirin. 
<li><STRONG>Reaction of proposed medication</STRONG> <br>
Aspirin and ibuprofen can cause stomach irritation. Asthmatics should avoid these. 
<li><STRONG> Establish patient preference</STRONG><br>
Allow patients to select the product they prefer: systemic, drops or sprays. 
<P>
<H3>Product selection</H3>
The aim of treatment is to allow the sinus to drain and reduce the pain. Decongestants, systemic or topical, are reasonable. The pain may be controlled by any minor analgesic. Both these are discussed above and should be referred to.

Any drug which produces alterations in sensory perception and thought processes is termed a hallucinogen. However, such a definition does not embrace the range of effects which are produced by such drugs. These effects are best described as sensory distortions. Other terms which have been used to describe these effects include psychomimetic (ie psychosis mimicking), psycholytic (mind-loosening), psychodysleptic (mind-disrupting) and oneirogenic (causing dreams).
<P>
In 1956, psychiatrist Humphrey Osmond first coined a term which has become more widely associated with the hallucinogens and by which such drugs are often known: psychedelics.
<P>
<H3>Natural sources</H3>
Very little is known about the modern usage of hallucinogenic (or magic) mushrooms in the UK. The most recent statistics, from the British crime survey, reported that 10 per cent of those aged between 16 and 29 had used magic mushrooms.
<P>
The legal status of magic mushrooms and other natural hallucinogens is not straightforward. In their natural state, simple possession of the drugs, such as psilocin, is not illegal. It is only when the mushrooms are 'prepared', such as by boiling, crushing or even slicing the mushrooms, that the substances become controlled drugs.
<P>
These are the common naturally-derived hallucinogens.
<li><STRONG> Psilocybin and psilocin</STRONG><br>
Perhaps the most famous of the naturally-occurring hallucinogens are the so-called magic mushrooms. These toadstools, in particular Psilocybe mexicana, contain the hallucinogens psilocybin and psilocin.The most common variety of the mushroom seen in the UK is the 'Liberty Cap' (Psylocybe semilanceata). 
<li><STRONG> Bufotenine</STRONG><br>
This hallucinogen is found in the fly-agaric mushroom  (Amanita muscaria), which is also poisonous. As well as its hallucinogenic properties, bufotenine is also said to cause rages if taken in sufficient quantities.There is ample evidence suggesting that the native tribesmen of North East Asia and Siberia, and the Vikings used the fly-agaric mushroom.
<li><STRONG> Mescaline</STRONG><br>
This is derived from the peyote cactus (lophophora williamsii), which is native to Mexico and the south western United States. It has been used as part of religious ceremonies for centuries by the Aztec Indians who believed that peyote was a sacred herb placed on earth by the gods. Even today, peyotism is a recognised religion of native Americans and, since 1979, the religious use of peyote has been exempt from Federal US drug abuse laws. 
<li><STRONG> Other natural agents </STRONG><br>
Morning glory seeds contain lysergic acid amide, which is related to lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), though it is only about one tenth as potent. If the seeds are eaten, they pass through the tract without effect. However, if the seeds are chewed, then the effects come on within 90 minutes and are similar to those of LSD. 
Nutmeg is also known to contain hallucinogenic amphetamines, called elemicin and myristicin. The powder is eaten or snorted and low doses result in euphoria, light-headedness and CNS stimulation. However, high doses give rise to hallucinations coupled with agitation, anxiety or vomiting.
<P>
<H3>Synthetic drugs</H3>
The synthetic hallucinogens have attracted more attention with regard to drug misuse. These include the following drugs.
<li><STRONG> LSD</STRONG><br>
The most famous of the synthetic hallucinogens is undoubtedly LSD (d-lyseric acid diethylamide or LSD-25). It is derived from lysergic acid which is obtained from the ergot fungus that grows on rye and wheat. It was first synthesised in 1938. 
Five years later, Albert Hofman, a Swiss chemist, working for Sandoz in Geneva, accidentally experienced the first LSD 'trip' while searching for a respiratory stimulant. 
<li><STRONG> Phencyclidine</STRONG><br>
Also known as PCP, angel dust and hog. It was first developed in the 1950s as a general anaesthetic, though it was withdrawn in 1965 due to the undesirable side-effects it produced, such as convulsions and hallucinations. During the 1960s, the drug was re-marketed as an animal anaesthetic, but was soon offered for illicit sale (either snorted or injected).
The effects of PCP, which can be experienced with as little as 5-10mg, are similar to other hallucinogens, though dependence has been seen. However, once the effects wear off, it can produce an irritable depression. It is often found as an adulterant in street samples of LSD.
<li><STRONG> Ketamine</STRONG><br>
This is a shorter-acting anaesthetic, also known as Special K. This derivative of PCP was first made in 1962, and is still used today. It was first used illicitly in the US during the early 1970s, either snorted or smoked. In the UK, use of ketamine seems to have increased alongside the use of ecstasy. As with PCP, ketamine produces a dissociative state, making the user feel detached from themselves. It can also cause catelepsy, which results in the person being unable to move until the effects are worn off. Ketamine is currently not controlled by the Misuse of Drugs Act and it is believed that most of the drug is obtained by diversion from legitimate sources.
<li><STRONG> Antidepressants</STRONG><br>
There are reports of people injecting fluoxetine. The general availability of the newer anti-depressant drugs, such as seretonin re-uptake inhibitors, have created a new breed of substance misusers. While such drugs have a legitimate use, they are all too often freely available and subject to misuse.
<li> Other synthetic drugs
These are mainly phenylethylamines and related to the hallucinogenic amphetamines, such as ecstasy. These include DPM (2,5-dimethoxy-4methyl amphetamine) or, as it became known on the street, STP (Serenity, Tranquillity and Peace). Other hallucinogenic amphetamines include PMA (paramethoxyamphetamine) and TMA (trimethoxyamphetamine), though mescaline found in the peyote cactus is an amphetamine-based compound.
<P>
<H3>LSD use and misuse</H3>
In the 1950s, LSD was perceived as a psycho-therapeutic tool. It was used in a number of areas, such as treatment of alcohol and drug addiction, to give insight into the pathology of a condition, such as personality disorders, and to help in jogging the memory of repressed individuals. 
<P>
The potential use of LSD by military forces was explored by the CIA, which envisaged the drug being used to aid in the interrogation of captured enemies, as well as some sort of mind-controlling agent. Moreover, much of the academic research into LSD was fund by the CIA.
<P>
In the 1960s, the illicit use of LSD began to take over from its therapeutic application. At Harvard medical school, information on the effects of the drug was fed back to one of the psychology professors involved, Timothy Leary. He later conducted his own research into the effects of LSD and conceived the notion that the drug represented a chemical 'key' which opened up the mind to new levels of self-awareness. 
<P>
LSD became associated with the emerging 'hippy' culture and its use reached its pinnacle during the 1960s, with many famous writers and musicians being heavily influenced by the drug. LSD was made illegal in 1966 and, after the 1971 Misuse of Drugs Act, it was ranked as a Class A drug. 
<P>
Though the 1970s saw a decline in LSD use, interest in the drug seems to have grown (according to greater Customs seizures of the drug) during the late 1980s in line with the emergence of 'acid house' music. The recent British crime survey, reports that 9 per cent of respondents have used LSD.
<P>
Today, LSD is normally sold as microdots - blotting paper squares (around 1cm) impregnated with the drug. Each microdot costs 5-10, is  normally sucked, and carries colourful images. 
<P>
<H3>Mode of action</H3>
The precise mechanism of action of LSD and all the hallucinogens is not fully understood. All the hallucinogenic drugs can be divided into two chemical types - the indolylalkylalmines and phenylalkylamines. Both structural features are present in neurotransmitters.
<P>
It is important to understand how input of sensory information to the high centres of the brain is controlled in order to understand mode of action.
<P>
The level of brain activity is controlled by the ascending reticular system in the brain stem. Certain regions of the brain stem, such as the locus coeruleus (LC) and the raphe nuclei (RN) appear to play an important role to moderate the amount of sensory information which is received by the higher centres of the brain. It is known that 5HT (serotonin) is one of the main transmitters involved and acts to inhibit the flow of sensory information, possibly to protect the brain from sensory overload. 
<P>
LSD may work by removing the inhibitory action of 5HT, specifically in the RN, either pre-synaptically, post-synaptically (as an antagonist) or even by being a partial 5HT agonist itself. While each theory has some merit, the discovery of 5HT receptor sub-types and the fact that LSD causes the release of noradrenaline in the LC, makes a description of the action mode complicated.
<P>
It is currently thought that LSD acts as a partial agonist at the 5HT2 receptor since specific antagonists for this receptor, such as mianserin, can block many of the behavioural effects of LSD.
<P>
<H3>General effects</H3> 
The effects of LSD and other hallucinogens are well defined, though they are heavily dependent on the user's expectations and environment. Typically, LSD tablets contain 75mcg, though the dose required for a full-blown 'trip' is anything up to 150mcg. The effects start about 30 minutes after taking the drug and peak after about six hours. The effects gradually wear off over the next 12 hours.
<P>
There are few significant physiological changes which occur after taking LSD. After taking a dose, there is a slight rise in blood pressure, pupil dilation and increased muscle tension, which can result in tingling and numbness of the toes and fingers and slight ataxia.
<P>
In the long-term, LSD and other hallucinogens produce few adverse effects. In animal dependency models, LSD and other hallucinogens are not self-administered, suggesting that they are not physically addictive. However, tolerance to the effects and cross-tolerance with other hallucinogens does develop, which suggests a similar mode of action. While the hallucinogens are extremely potent, they are remarkably safe drugs. LSD has been used in doses of up to 400mcg and still not produced any changes in subjects. In fact, death from overdose is extremely rare and people have survived large doses.
<P>
<H3>Psychological</H3>
Most users report visual distortions and a sharpening of perception together with a sense of detachment. Others report pseudo-hallucinations and the person realises that their hallucinations are unreal. True hallucinations are rare, though there have been a few cases where users have died after believing they could fly and jumping off buildings.
<P>
Another effect which is often reported is synasthesia, where senses get mixed up and people start to 'hear' colours and 'see' music. It is worth noting that when LSD is taken in conditions of sensory deprivation, such as in a darkened room (or even by blind people), the visual hallucinations are not experienced or are severely reduced. It is likely that synasthesia can be explained by the effects of LSD on the 5HT system in the LC as discussed earlier.
<P>
One of the adverse effects is the potential for 'flashbacks', which normally last no longer than a few minutes (though they can last several hours) and can occur months after taking the drug. The flashbacks are harmless, but might come when the person is tired or stressed and can be disconcerting. Perhaps the most distressing potential adverse effect is the development of psychosis, though there is no convincing evidence that LSD or any other hallucinogen can induce psychosis. In cases where psychoses have developed in LSD users, it is likely the drug acts merely in a precipitative role in susceptible individuals.

Amphetamine was first synthesised in 1887, though it was not until sometime in the 1920s that it was used in humans. The amphetamine freebase is fairly volatile. It was originally marketed in 1932 by Smith Kline & French as a nasal decongestant inhaler for the treatment of colds and hayfever symptoms.
<P>
The stimulant effects of the drug did not go unnoticed and, as a result, amphetamine was soon used, and continues to be used, to treat narcolepsy  (a condition of uncontrollable sleepiness). Amphetamine use soon became widespread and by the late 1940s there were as many as 39 accepted medical indications for amphetamine.

<H3>Amphetamine abuse </H3>
The non-medical uses of the drug can be traced to World War II when British and German soldiers took it as a pep pill to maintain wakefulness and to counteract fatigue. It was not until 1956 that amphetamine was made a Prescription Only Medicine.
<P>
Although legislation in 1964 restricted the supply of amphetamines, a growing black market emerged. The prescribing of injectable methylamphetamine by doctors at the newly-established drug dependency units to treat cocaine addicts created further problems and in 1968 prescribing of injectable amphetamine was restricted to hospitals.
<P>
Amphetamines are in Class B of the Misuse of Drugs Act and Schedule 2 of the Misuse of Drug Regulations. However, if prepared for injection, this constitutes a Class A offence. 
<P>
Though prevalence varies throughout the country, official figures show that amphetamine users represented 10 per cent of those making contact with agencies in 1994. Home Office figures also show that in 1994 there were 13,000 amphetamine seizures and 8,500 amphetamine offences.
<P>
Today, amphetamine misuse is confined mainly to amphetamine sulphate (known as sulphate, speed or whizz), an off-white powder which is usually produced illicitly. 
<P>
Generally, the quality of illicit amphetamine is poor, sometimes as low as 2 per cent. It is diluted (or cut) with a number of compounds, including ephedrine (which is chemically similar to amphetamine), caffeine, glucose, vitamin C or sometimes chalk and talcum powder. 
<P>
Amphetamine can cost about 10-12 a gram (or 5 a 'wrap' or bag) and is either sniffed, swallowed, dissolved in alcoholic drinks or injected. Regular users may inject up to 8g a day and this can continue for several days in a so-called 'speed-run'.

<H3>Mode of action</H3>
The mode of action of amphetamine (and other CNS stimulants, such as cocaine) is still not entirely clear. On a simple biochemical basis, it is known that amphetamines increase the secretion and inhibit the re-uptake of noradrenaline, dopamine and serotonin. In addition, amphetamine is a weak agonist at post-synaptic amine receptors. However, it is the release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens, which is part of the mesolimbic dopaminergic pathway, which is responsible for the production of the pleasurable and mood-elevating effects of amphetamine. 
<P>
Nevertheless, it is not true to say that the mood-altering effects of amphetamines are solely attributable to the increase in dopamine in the nucleus accumbens, as such increases can also occur in the presence of food, sexual partners or other pleasurable stimuli. 
<P>
The elucidation of the mode of action of stimulants remains in its infancy and the failure of simple dopaminergic antagonists to treat addiction illustrates how little is known about how such drugs exert their effects. Nonetheless, the development of powerful imaging techniques, such as PET (positron emission tomography) and SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography), are beginning to shed light on the nature of receptor binding in human addict studies.

<H3>Amphetamine effects</H3>
The main reason why people use amphetamines is to become more alert, overcome fatigue since they provide more energy and generally produce a feeling of exhilaration. Because of these effects, amphetamines have been used by students (usually before exams to allow them to study all night) long-distance lorry drivers and shift works. 
<P>
Although now banned in sport, amphetamine use was popular among cyclists and  it is now becoming more popular with some body builders as a means of reducing fat.
<P>
Amphetamines exert both sympathomimetic and psychiatric effects: 
<P>
<li><STRONG> Sympathomimetic </STRONG>
Amphetamines increase 
heart rate, raise blood pressure, reduce appetite 
and saliva production and may produce an adverse effect in those people already taking sympathomimetic drugs. Pupil dilatation also occurs, causing some amphetamine users to become photo-phobic.
<P>
Users who inject the drug start to experience the effects almost immediately and will inject every two or so hours. Regular users may continue to inject for a few days and neglect both eating and sleeping. It is possible for some users to inject several grams of amphetamine and chronic users can use up to 15g in 24 hours. 
<P>
However, it should be remembered that the purity of street amphetamine is 
very low. Moreover, it is only the d-isomer which is 
psycho-active. 
<P>
<li><STRONG> Psychiatric</STRONG>
Perhaps one of the more famous effects of amphetamines is their ability to produce a psychosis which was originally mis-diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenia. The main difference between the amphetamine psychosis and the paranoid schizophrenic is that the former psychosis disappears a few days after the drug is no longer used.
<P>
The psychosis is characterised by feelings of persecution, abrupt mood swings and hallucinations. One particular hallucination is the belief that small insects are crawling all over their skin. This can be quite serious as users may cause themselves to bleed by their aggressive scratching. Such observations have also been produced in experimental animals exposed to amphetamine.

<H3>Withdrawal</H3>
Drugs such as opiates produce a well defined withdrawal syndrome consisting of a range of symptoms such as goose-flesh and sweating. These are physical symptoms which are thought to be due to enhanced adrenergic activity which is presumably suppressed by opiates. 
<P>
However, with amphetamines, the withdrawal syndrome is not so well defined, though chronic administration of amphetamines (or any other abused drug) does result in homeostatic adaptations and the consequent withdrawal effects produced in the absence of the drug have been attributed to reduced levels of dopamine. 
<P>
The amphetamine withdrawal syndrome is characterised by feelings of lethargy, extreme tiredness (often sleeping constantly for up to three days), a voracious appetite and sometimes suicidal tendencies. 
<P>
Withdrawal effects have been reproduced in laboratory animals which are given unlimited access to CNS stimulants. After a period of 72 hours they were found to be less likely to self-administer the drug.


<H3>Treating misuse</H3>
As mentioned earlier, some doctors in the 1960s attempted to treat cocaine addiction with methylamphetamine. Since 1988, the three reports from the Advisory Council on Drug Misuse, and even the Government's guidelines for clinical management of drug dependency, have stated that there is no place for the prescribing of substitute stimulant drugs. 
<P>
This seems unusual given that in certain areas of the country the main drug of abuse appears to be amphetamine and, while opiate addicts can receive a prescription for a substitute (methadone), there is no equivalent for amphetamine users.
<P>
In defiance of all accepted guidelines, several treatment agencies have instigated a policy of prescribing dexamphetamine to dependent users and this has met with considerable success. 
<P>
One particular area where amphetamine prescribing has been successful is Portsmouth. An on-going prescribing scheme was established in 1989. Addicts are offered 30mg or 60mg of dexamphetamine in tablet form and are initially assessed for suitability for inclusion into the scheme. Assessment involves providing evidence of recent injection sites and supervised urine samples must contain amphetamine. 
<P>
Other stimulants, such as methylphenidate, have also been used with some success. Other approaches have involved the prescribing of antidepressants, such as fluoxetine and desipramine.
<P>
One of the potential problems with prescribing amphetamines is that there is no data on the long-term effects of the drug and, with the risk of developing psychosis, some people have argued that this approach is unethical. However, the results from on-going studies are encouraging and are successful in so far as they appear to attract many clients into treatment and have been shown to reduce their incidence of injecting and needle sharing.
<P>
There is clearly a need to give some form of medical intervention to help the problem amphetamine user. The results to date indicate that substitute stimulant prescribing can and does offer enormous benefits to addicts. In addition, the prescription is best seen as the carrot that entices amphetamine users through the door of the treatment centre. If the potential of a prescription is enough to get people to come forward, then this in itself is a major step in reaching a group of problem drug users who, at present, see little hope in seeking help at drug treatment agencies.
<P>

<P>

<H3>classes of amphetamines </H3>
Amphetamine derivatives: 
<li> Dexamphetamine: dextro-isomer of amphetamine; the more potent psychostimulant which is commercially available as Dexedrine 
<li> Methylamphetamine: amphetamine derivative also known as Ice and Speed
<li> Methylenedioxmethamphetamine: MDMA, also known as Ecstasy. 
<P>
Compounds which are chemically related to amphetamine, but lack the psychostimulant properties include:
<li>Fenfluramine (Ponderax)
<li> Dexfenfluramine (Adifax)
<li> Diethylpropion (Tenuate dospan).
<P> 
These drugs are used clinically in the management of obesity and are not considered to be addictive, although more recently this premise has been challenged.
<P>
<hr size=1 width=400 align=center>

<P>


<H3>Ecstasy</H3>
Ecstasy or MDMA (methylenedioxmethamphetamine) is an amphetamine derivative first synthesised in 1913 by Merck Sharpe & Dohme as an appetite suppressant, but never used. It was thought to have been used later in the 1950s by the US army for military applications.
<P>
 During the early 1980s, MDMA is believed to have been used by psychiatrists and therapists in the US. Ecstasy use became widespread in the UK in the late 1980s with emergence of the all-night dance 'rave'.
<P>
<li> Effects: in 1992, research into the effects of MDMA found that it had positive effects on mood, with people reporting that it had a lasting positive effect on their social/interpersonal functioning, while others noted how it altered their spiritual outlook on life. In fact, some of these positive effects have been noted by those people who take fluoxetine. 
<P>
The effects of Ecstasy appear after about an hour and can last for several hours. It produces an amphetamine-like sense of euphoria and has similar sympathomimetic effects. It also has hallucinogenic effects and it is known to stimulate serotonin receptors. Research indicates that, when given over a long period of time to laboratory animals, it can lead to degeneration of seratonergic pathways.
<P>
<li> Presentation: Ecstasy is available as tablets, but can vary in shape, size and colour. The most common brands possess the impression of a bird and are known as 'doves'. As with many other drugs, there is always the problem of adulteration. Analysis of Ecstasy tablets has shown that the highest concentration was no more than 30 per cent, and many of these contained other ingredients, such as caffeine, ketamine, triprolidine and MDE (methlenedioxyethlamphetamine), which is not the methylamphetamine derivative.
<P>
<li> Fatalities: there have been many deaths attributable to Ecstasy. The deaths that have occurred have been mainly due to heat-stroke, heart attacks or cerebral haemorrhages. Ecstasy also causes the release of anti-diuretic hormone, which ultimately leads to fluid accumulation, especially in those who are drinking large amounts of water. It is important that users recognise the signs of heat-stroke, such as cramp pains in the limbs, vomiting and a sudden feeling of tiredness. 
<P>
<hr size=1 width=400 align=center>
<P>


<H3>Crack cocaine</H3>
<P>
Crack cocaine is the freebase form of cocaine. Normally, cocaine exists as a hydrochloric acid salt. The freebase (cocaine form) can therefore be produced by heating with an alkaline agent, such as bicarbonate and water.
<P>
Crack first appeared in the UK in 1988 and law enforcement agencies were warned of an impending epidemic produced by this highly-addictive drug. This epidemic failed to materialise, although more worrying was the emergence of reports in 1990 that crack was being injected. This represented a potential problem since research had shown that cocaine injectors were more likely to share equipment and so risk infection with HIV and hepatitis. Crack is prepared for injection by mixing it with vitamin C to produce an acid salt which is water-soluble.
<P>
<li> Effects: although short-lived, normally lasting for about 15 minutes, crack produces an intense high and users will often use large amounts. In general, crack is heated in pipes (normally soft drinks cans or plastic bottles) until it vaporises and the fumes are inhaled. The effects of crack and cocaine are similar to amphetamines, characterised by feelings of wellbeing and euphoria. In laboratory experiments, addicts were unable to determine whether they were given cocaine or amphetamines.
<P>
<li> Presentation: cocaine costs around 100 per gram and the heavy users might sniff up to 2g a day. Crack costs around 25 for a wrap (or bag) which contains about quarter of a gram. Generally, the purity of cocaine is between 60 and 80 per cent.

<H3><B>Government attitude puts sanctions on NPA agenda</B></H3>
<P>
Possible pharmacist sanctions are to be considered by the National Pharmaceutical Association.
<P>
Recent derisory pay offers, combined with the refusal to establish an independent review body to examine pharmacists' remuneration are just two examples of how Department of Health officials and ministers are failing to recognise and reward the valuable role that pharmacists play in helping to deliver the Government's healthcare targets, says April's NPA Board report.
<P>
It reveals that members' patience is wearing thin, with widespread anger and frustration at the lack of regard with which community pharmacy is seemingly held by DoH officials. 
<P>
As a consequence, a "serious debate on the use of sanctions" and the possible range of sanctions available is scheduled for the end of this month.
<P>
<B>Takeover bid</B> 
<P>
The NPA has appeared before the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's investigative committee into the proposed Lloyds' takeover bid, made by Unichem and Gehe. 
<P>
An NPA delegation comprising the director, Tim Astill, Peter Jenkins, Alan Cruickshank and Wally Dove met with the Committee this week to reiterate its view that the NPA's only concern was the possible loss of wholesaler choice in some areas.
<P>
<B>Peter Jenkins becomes chairman</B>
<P>
South Wales' pharmacist Peter Jenkins has been elected as the National Pharmaceutical Association's chairman for 1996-97. Mr Jenkins succeeds Wally Dove, who recently became the new chairman of the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee.
<P>
Alan Cruickshank (Scotland) replaces Mr Jenkins as vice chairman, with David Thomas (West Midlands) re-elected as treasurer.

<H3><B>Bigger but fewer pharmacies forecast</B></H3>
<P>
There will be a natural evolution towards bigger, and probably fewer, pharmacies, says the National Pharmaceutical Association in response to Pharmacy in a New Age.
<P>
Pharmacy proprietors should be encouraged by incentives to relocate or amalgamate, rather than be discouraged from doing so by disincentives, such as financial attrition.
<P>
In a 'steady as you go approach' the NPA emphasises a need for more resources which should be regarded as "an investment in healthcare" and may result in reduced hospital costs and improved quality of life.
<P>
Closer relationships between patients and pharmacists will form, removing a need for compulsory patient registration. However, the profession should be considering item of service or capitation fees, especially if patient registration were to become the norm.
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Pharmacists should be given the right to prescribe certain prescription medicines, within specified protocols, says the College of Pharmacy Practice in its Pharmacy in a New Age response. "It might be a requirement that pharmacists prescribed certain medicines for at least two years before they transferred to P status," adds the CPP. Pharmacists may also have a greater supervisory role with patients who are self-prescribing.

<H3><B>Labour man pledges backing for pharmacists</B></H3>
<P>
Community pharmacists are key players in the Labour Party's intention to create a caring community in the next millennium.
<P>
Speaking at the Scottish Pharmaceutical General Council's annual dinner last week, Labour's shadow secretary of state for Scotland, George Robertson, said: "The local chemist is a key player in the kind of caring, valuing, but prudent and prosperous community which has to be our model for Britain." Mr Robertson also pledged his party would be examining the fight to protect Resale Price Maintenance. 
<P>
SPGC chairman Andrew Taylor pointed out that there was further scope for the pharmacist as a key member of the primary healthcare team. He cited POM to P switches as offering potential for further changes, and suggested pharmacists become involved in discharge planning.
<P>
But such changes would require extra funding and a revamp of the remuneration system, commented Mr Taylor, adding that the SPGC would welcome discussions with Labour to "develop a system whereby the skills and knowledge of community pharmacists are most appropriately used".

<H3><B>Numark promises increased value for shareholders</B></H3>
<P>
Numark directors recommended an interest payment of 5 per cent per annum from February, 1995, on all shareholdings, in addition to 1995 allocations, at the company's first AGM in Birmingham recently.
<P>
The 1995 results show a surplus of 377,000 before allocations of 326,000 on a turnover for the period of 5,523,755. This represents a recovery of 84 per cent of the fee for the 11 months for the average shareholder. The highest sum paid in rebate to a single pharmacy shareholder was 1,255. It is the intention of Numark that the rebate should exceed 100 per cent in 1996.
<P>
The company commenced trading on February 1, 1995, with 820 pharmacies. The figure now stands at 900. Own-brand sales were up by 21 per cent on 1994. Twenty-nine products were launched and six relaunched. There was a 79 per cent increase on OTC earnings in 1995 over 1994.
<P>
An EPoS user group is being formed to offer information and guidance to shareholders, especially in matters of range, pricing and stockholding.
<P>
Terry Norris, Numark's managing director, told C&D that a data collection system from a user group representing different types of pharmacies is now in place. Analysis of the data will enable rapid merchandising advice to be provided. The system, which currently involves 30-35 users and is expanding, will be able to report on what is selling and what linear footage is being given to particular groups of products.
<P>
Some problems on reporting and communication arose in 1995, but these are being addressed in 1996. A programme of visiting shareholders is beginning this month.

<H3><B>Glaxo Wellcome 'to get closer' to community pharmacies</B></H3>
<P>
There was speculation this week that long-standing talks between Glaxo Wellcome and wholesalers on the company's agency scheme were reaching a crucial point with an imminent announcement possible. GW has been re-assessing trading agreements and has consulted the British Association of Pharmaceutical Wholesalers. 
<P>
However, a spokesperson for GW said aspects of the agreement were still being examined and a  strategy might not be finalised until later in the summer.
<P>
Meanwhile, GW is conducting a survey of community pharmacy. It has sent a questionnaire to all community pharmacists in what its believes is recognition of their importance as customers and "the need to get closer to them".

<H3><B>European challenge over parallel imports</B></H3>
<P>
Three research-based companies are taking the European Commission to court in a bid to prevent economic damage from the parallel importing of unpatented products from Spain and Portugal.
<P>
Glaxo Wellcome, Merck Sharp & Dohme and Organon filed an action on Monday with the Court of First Instance of the European Communities to challenge the Commission's decision to reject applications by ten member states for safeguards against distortions in the internal market.
<P>
The transition period in Spain's accession treaty, which allowed patent holders to block unpatented Spanish imports, is ending.

<H3><B>Sex shop links worry Society's Council</B></H3>
<P>
The Royal Pharmaceutical Society is concerned that pharmacies operating in close proximity with sex shops could bring the profession into disrepute.
<P>
The concern has prompted the Society's Council to warn pharmacists not to sell products "which may be detrimental to the good standing of the profession. The Council does not wish to be specific or exhaustive in listing the products, but considers that ... pornographic literature and videos are inappropriate".
<P>
Council is concerned that customers' perception of pharmacy might be adversely affected if they are unable to distinguish between the professional area and other parts of the pharmacy, as laid down in obligation 8.2 of the code of ethics.
<P>
The Society's director of legal services, Sue Sharpe, told C&D that a couple of cases had been brought to the Society's attention of pharmacies appearing to be combined with sex shops and selling goods that might be considered incompatible with professional healthcare services. 
<P>
The Council wanted to alert pharmacists to potential problems, but was unable to be more specific because it was difficult to define exactly what was unsuitable for a pharmacy. It would be left to inspectors to try to resolve problems locally before referring individual cases to Council and then, if necessary, to the Statutory Committee.
<P>
She added that Council statements such as this carried the same authority as the Code of Ethics and this one might eventually be incorporated into the Code.

<H3><B>NPA highlights pharmacy recruitment problems</B></H3>
<P>
The National Pharmaceutical Association has released the results of a survey which back its claim that there is a manpower problem in community pharmacy. Recruitment advertisements were monitored for five months. From a sample of 100 proprietors who had attempted to recruit a pharmacy manager during this period, 45 had failed to fill the post despite repeated adverts.
<P>
Just less than a third had to advertise on more than three occasions before being successful, and 14 admitted that the eventual appointee had not been their ideal choice.
<P>
The NPA's Board, meeting at the end of last month, considered that one possible explanation for the shortage of applicants was that pharmacists were opting for locum, rather than pharmacy manager, appointments. The demand for locums is currently so high that it affords a degree of 'job security' without management responsibilities. 
<P>
The findings of the survey will be presented to the Royal Pharmaceutical Society and shared with the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee to assist in pay negotiations with the Department of Health.

<H3><B>Persona's Boots exclusive deal cuts out independents</B></H3>
<P>
Unipath's decision to launch its new fertility diagnostic device, Persona, exclusively through Boots will deny independent pharmacies the chance to sell the product for at least 12 months. The one-year exclusive deal was struck with Boots because Unipath felt the company would be able to provide the high degree of support and commitment that the product needed.
<P>
European business group manager Scott Wotherspoon says letters are going out to independents to inform them of the launch, and interested pharmacists are to be recruited for a 'second phase' launch. Meanwhile, customer inquiries should be directed to Unipath's general information line on 0345 447744. 
<P>
''We believe we will work very strongly with independents, and it concerns us a great deal that there are worries for the [pharmacy] trade,'' says Mr Wotherspoon. The National Pharmaceutical Association says it is ''dismayed that Unipath has denied 10,000 pharmacies the opportunity to distribute its product by choosing to do an exclusive deal with Boots. We believe that their decision will prejudice themselves and consumers''. 
<P>
Many people will be asking at their local pharmacy for information about the new contraceptive and it is unrealistic to expect pharmacists to direct them to a major competitor, the NPA adds. One of a number of disappointed independent pharmacists is Harry Ganz of the Garden Pharmacy in London. He has stopped selling the Clear Blue brand as a consequence. ''Nearly all pregnancy tests are sold on a pharmacist's recommendation, and there are several brands on the market.''

<H3><B>NHS fee heads towards 44,500</B></H3>
<P>
Pharmacies in England received an average of 44,977 each in fees for dispensing NHS prescriptions in the year to March 31.The total fees were 440.2 million, a 3 per cent increase over the previous year. The average net ingredient cost in 1995-96 was 7.65, 4 per cent higher than the previous year.
<P>
The trend to multiple ownership has slowed. On March 31, 63 per cent of pharmacies were independent, 36 per cent belonged to chains (from five or six branches to large multiples) and over 1 per cent operated from health centres. On March 31, 1995, the figures were 65, 34 and 1 per cent respectively.
<P>
Over half (54 per cent) of the pharmacies in contract on March 31 received payment for supply of oxygen services and 3,491 were being paid to give advice to nursing and/or residential homes. By March 31, 10,532 of the 16,317 residential homes in England were receiving paid advice from a pharmacist.
<P>
The number of essential small pharmacies has risen from 150 in March, 1992, to 269 in March, 1996; 20 of these are multiples. Kensington, Chelsea & Westminster has the most pharmacies per head of population. The number of appliance contractors has been steadily decreasing, but the number of items dispensed increased 17 per cent to 908,200. On March 31, there were 244 in contract, but 43 did no NHS dispensing.

<H3><B>Grant puts CPD on the Web</B></H3>
<P>
A consortium in Wales has won a 30,000 award to develop a continuing education project for independent pharmacies on the World Wide Web. Pharmacists will be able to obtain 'books' on specific topics using an Apple Newton - a small, portable personal digital assistant which can access the WWW.
<P>
The project has been devised by the Welsh Centre for Post-graduate Pharmaceutical Education, community pharmacist Simon Whittaker and Memory Place, a company producing interactive multimedia products. Dr David Temple, WCPPE director, says that pharmacists will be able to download the centre's educational material on to the Newtons, which will be cheaper than paying for time on the Internet. 
<P>
The initial project, which runs until March, 1997, will develop appropriate software. It will be some time before the system will be available to pharmacists in Wales.
<P>
The award is part of a 2 million prize provided by the DTI's Information Society Initiative Multimedia Demonstrator Programme. The applicants had to demonstrate how their project could improve business performance through the creative use of multimedia technologies.

<H3><B>RPM challenged by new competition law</B></H3>
<P>
The director general of the Office of Fair Trading has yet to decide whether to refer the issue of Resale Price Maintenance on medicines to the Restrictive Practices Court. A decision is not expected before mid-October. However, should the DGFT decide not to refer the case, Price Maintenance will face a new challenge from Government plans to include RPM in its new Competition Law Reform Bill, the National Pharmaceutical Association Board has been warned. 
<P>
RPM on medicines would be prohibited unless it could be proved that it was uneconomic to do so. The 'public interest' argument for retaining RPM would no longer be available. If this legislation went through as proposed, RPM would be more vulnerable than ever. 
<P>
The NPA and the Royal Pharmaceutical Society have already met the Department of Trade to voice the profession's concerns over these proposals, and to make it clear that the Community Pharmacy Action Group will fight the issue should the legislation be put to parliament in its current form.
<P>
Meanwhile, CPAG's lobbying  campaign to preserve RPM is making a mark. It has received widespread support among MPs, and has been, or will be, present at all three major political party conferences. A meeting at the Liberal Democrats' conference was attended by over 50 delegates.

<H3><B>Rowland unveils 'new concept' pharmacy</B></H3>
<P>
L Rowland's new pharmacy located in central Wrexham is merchandising P and GSL products together as part of the chain's new approach to community pharmacy. Rowland, which owns 65 pharmacies in North Wales, Cheshire and Shropshire, says it wants to give equal emphasis to every medicine in the 800sq ft pharmacy.
<P>
The pharmacy's GSL products are on self-service shelves, while P products are protected by clear, acrylic-based shields, which carry the message: 'Please ask your pharmacist for advice'.
<P>
Products that a pharmacist would be expected to advise consumers on, such as laxatives, are also protected by acrylic covers. All the medicines are laid out in therapeutic groups and each group is identified by a header card. EPoS information has been used to decide which products the pharmacy should carry. 
<P>
Rowland says the new layout reflects two aims: to give medicines as much space as possible and to ensure the pharmacist is always involved when a consumer requests a medicine, whether or not it is classed P or GSL. The pharmacy's manager, Pamela Shimmin, checks the prescriptions and passes them to her dispensing assistant, who processes them and gives the dispensed items and stock containers to Ms Shimmin to be checked, bagged and handed to patients. 
<P>
Ms Shimmin also deals with requests for medicine and with advice about health issues. A counter assistant, who has been given training on medicines, operates the counter till. 
<P>
Ms Shimmin welcomes her role in the new-look pharmacy. ''The changeover to patient pack dispensing, which has already begun, will mean the process of dispensing will become even more mechanical. If we, as pharmacists, have a role to play in the future, we must be seen to be more proactive.''

Liam Fitzgerald, United Drug's general manager, says it is having ''extremely positive discussions'' with other manufacturers and that it hopes to seal two more deals by the end of the year.
<P>
Bristol-Myers' products will be distributed from UDG's central UK warehouse, close to Unichem's central warehouse in South Normanton, near Mansfield. Unichem says Bristol-Myers will benefit from outsourcing the central distribution of its high volume of goods, and that the company will also have a vertically-integrated 'downstream' distribution system stemming from Unichem and United Drug's own wholesale operations. United Drug remains Bristol-Myers' pre-wholesale distributor in Ireland.

<H3><B>Unichem joins card scheme</B></H3>
<P>
Unichem is set to be one of the first pharmaceutical wholesalers to take on Norton Healthcare's membership card scheme. The deal is an early triumph for Norton, which had aimed to involve Unichem and AAH in the membership card scheme (Norton Advantage) by the end of October. 
<P>
Pharmacies serviced by Unichem's Preston depot will be able to join the scheme by mid-October. Unichem's customers elsewhere should be able to join by the end of November. All members should be able to order and receive daily Norton generics and Baker Norton products through Unichem.
<P>
As well as receiving a 10 per cent discount on the products, members are awarded credits against their purchases. ''Our role is to ensure the success of the scheme by providing a consistent and frequent delivery service for pharmacists,'' says Martyn Ward, Unichem's sales and marketing director.

<H3><B>Pharmacy welcomes Malone's repeat and instalment scripts move</B></H3>
<P>
Health Minister Gerald Malone has announced plans for a pilot study of instalment and repeat dispensing. The sudden move has surprised pharmacy bodies, which have been requesting such an initiative for some time.
<P>
Mike King, assistant secretary to the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee, says the PSNC welcomes the proposal and will be meeting the Department of Health on February 7 to discuss it. 
<P>
Roger Odd, head of practice at the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, says: "We welcome the news and look forward to being involved in what is going on."
<P>
Mr Malone made his announcement following the "bathroom cabinet survey" carried out to determine the level of unused prescribed medicines in the home. Another report, "Patients not paper", has recommended the DoH introduces a system of "serial repeat prescriptions". 
<P>
Repeat dispensing would involve pharmacists providing repeat supplies without further authorisation from, but with prior agreement of, the doctor. Amounts would be for long-term treatment, eg monthly supplies. Instalment dispensing would involve smaller amounts, eg CDs.
<P>
The Minister has decided to set up "some pilot schemes to test whether allowing pharmacists to dispense prescriptions in instalments can reduce the amount of medicines which never get taken".
<P>
He believes that spending on unnecessary quantities of drugs will be reduced and thinks repeat or instalment prescribing may:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> improve patients' understanding of their medicines and how to take them through more frequent contact with pharmacists
<LI>reduce paperwork for GPs
<LI>cut the chances of accidental poisoning by reducing the amount of medicines in the home
<LI>allow pharmacists to play a more active role in the primary healthcare team.
</UL>
<P>
The NHS Executive aims to introduce pilot schemes in April. It is looking for doctors, pharmacists and patients to take part, but the initial number of trial sites is expected to be small.
<P>
A new prescription form will be issued for participants, but payments and remuneration still have to be settled.
<P>
The"bathroom cabinet", or Residual Medicines, report reveals:
<UL>
<LI>less than 1 per cent of prescribed medicines in UK homes remain unused
<LI>only 8 per cent remain partially unused
<LI>proportionately more anti-infective drugs were residual
<LI>information about how long a medicine should be taken for was missing from the label in 64 per cent of unused medicines and 51 per cent of those for future use
<LI>a quarter of households have no prescribed medicines, while 18 per cent have five or more. The average is 2.6 medicines per household
<LI>three-quarters of medicines were currently in use or not yet started. Over a tenth were partly used and being kept for the future
<LI>more of the residual medicines were for 16-44-year-olds, whereas more of those currently in use were for those of 55 or over
<LI>almost two-thirds of medicines were in solid dosage forms. Over 40 per cent had no information on the label about the length of time they should be taken for
<LI>central nervous system medicines account for 25 per cent of prescribed medicines in the home, cardiovascular for 21 and respiratory disorders for 16 per cent
<LI>only 6 per cent were to be taken for 15 days or less
<LI>56 per cent were for females
<LI>over a third of the medicines prescribed for those under 25 were for respiratory conditions 
<LI>three-fifths of central nervous system and gastro-intestinals were for females
<LI>half of the households normally throw away unused medicines, while a sixth return them.

<H3><B>NPA to launch RPM education campaign</B></H3>
<P>
The National Pharmaceutical Association's Board has approved plans for a campaign to highlight probable pharmacy closures if Resale Price Maintenance is lost.
<P>
The campaign will be aimed at educating the public and informing MPs and other decision-makers. It will also emphasise that medicines are "not ordinary articles of commerce".
<P>
The Board was disturbed to learn that a small survey of NPA members had shown that some, notably those who had qualified since 1970, lacked understanding of the RPM issue, nor did they fully appreciate the possible consequences of its abolition. 
<P>
A third explanatory document is currently being distributed to members, together with a questionnaire seeking information about the significance of sales of proprietary medicines in the pharmacies concerned.
<P>
The Board also agreed to maintain close liaison with other organisations interested in the subject.
<UL>
<LI>The Proprietary Association of Great Britain, which represents the interests of OTC medicine manufacturers, is looking to appoint a PR company to aid it in the defence of RPM.

<H3><B>Contract compensation scheme to get Council airing</B></H3>
<P>
A compensation scheme for pharmacists relinquishing their NHS contracts is to be presented to the Royal Pharmaceutical Society's Council next week.
<P>
The initiative is the brainchild of Council member and founder of the Pharmacy Support Group, Hemant Patel. He believes that control of entry and exit should be considered in tandem.
<P>
The first move would be to freeze the number of NHS contracts to the current level, including dispensing doctor contracts. Those who wished to give up their contract would sell them to a national contracts buying agency for a "market" price. 
<P>
The seller would also pay a fee into a "transfer fund" for administration costs. This levy would be set at around 1 per cent of the selling price.
<P>
"What this scheme would do is to enable those trapped with a contract and getting nothing for their investment to go into retirement with dignity," says Mr Patel.
<P>
New contracts would attract a "pharmacy premium", which would be used to pay for the relinquished contract. Mr Patel suggests a minimum figure of 35,000-40,000.
<P>
But existing proprietors will also benefit. "It adds financial security to the NHS contract, which improves both the ability to borrow and ability to borrow cheaply. The result is improvement in cash flow." In addition, there will be no increased local competition. But Mr Patel concedes the move may not be able to halt the demise of independents and may possibly lead to a rise in the number of multiples.
<P>
He adds that further money for research could be obtained by the PSNC setting aside 1 per cent of its total budget. He is to present his proposal to the Committee next month.

<H3><B>Another rural judicial review pending</B></H3>
<P>
Disputes between dispensing doctors and rural pharmacists continue unabated, with Yorkshire GPs now seeking leave to appeal against the granting of a pharmacy contract.
<P>
An unnamed dispensing doctor practice is seeking a judicial review of a decision by North Yorkshire Family Health to grant a pharmacy contract in the village of Dunnington, some eight miles outside York. The pharmacist is already on the health authority's pharmaceutical list and as such the application bypassed the prejudice to medical services test.
<P>
The GPs had no right of appeal against the FHSA's judgment. The National Pharmaceutical Association has pledged its full support for the pharmacist.

<H3><B>LPC elections in new health authorities</B></H3>

Nominations are being sought for pharmacists to stand for election to local pharmaceutical committees in 45 of the 105 new health authorities.
<P>
Elections for both contractors and employee pharmacists will occur where new HA boundaries differ from present family health services authorities" borders.
<P>
Any contractor (except those represented by the Company Chemists Association or the Co-operative Pharmacy Technical Panel) or employee pharmacist in affected areas yet to receive a nomination form should contact their LPC secretary.
<P>
Nominations should be returned to the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee by February 9. Voting papers will be issued by March 1, to be returned to the Electoral Reform Society by March 15. Results will be announced by March 29.

<H3><B>EC approves Kimberly-Clark/Scott merger</B></H3>
<P>
The European Commission has finally approved the proposed merger between Kimberly-Clark and Scott Paper. However, the companies must divest some brands in the UK and Ireland before they can go ahead.
<P>
The merger, which was announced in July, 1995, brings together a number of strong brands, including Kleenex, Andrex, Scottex and Kimwipes. Kimberly-Clark's strengths in facial tissues, nappies and feminine care are complemented by Scott's in toilet tissue and kitchen towels. 

In December, 1995, the EC allowed the companies to progress with the merger on condition that they manage their European operations separately pending a final decision. The EC has now said that Kimberly-Clark will not be able to combine its Kleenex and Scott's Andrex consumer tissue businesses in the UK and Ireland, because of the dominant market position that would arise.

The new company, which will have annual sales of around 12 billion, will concentrate on three core businesses:
<UL>
<LI>consumer tissue products
<LI>personal care products
<LI>away from home products.
</UL>
<P>
However, the companies must sell off Kimberly-Clark's Kleenex toilet tissue business. Whoever buys it will be able to use the Kleenex trademark for a maximum of ten years and Kimberly-Clark has undertaken not to re-enter the market using the trademark for at least 15 years. Similar arrangements will apply to Kimberly-Clark's branded consumer kitchen towels.
<P>
The parties must also divest Scott's Scotties and Handy Andies and will undertake not to use the Andrex trademark for consumer facials and handkerchiefs in the UK and Ireland for an indefinite period.
<P>
Kimberly-Clark must also sell its tissue mill and converting factory in Prudhoe, Northumberland, as well as the offices, warehouses and distribution centre at the site. It must also downsize its Larkfield mill in the UK. None of the divestments were part of the original merger plans. These sell-offs will bring Kimberly-Clark's tissue paper production capacity to below 40 per cent of the UK and Ireland market.
<P>
The company will open a new headquarters for the UK regional consumer and home away from home businesses, and new offices in Austria and Russia. Kimberly-Clark says that existing supply arrangements will continue while the integration of the companies takes place.
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Tambrands is to take over sales and distribution of Sancella's Bodyform and Pennywise towels and pantyliners. The agreement makes Tambrands the largest sanpro supplier in the UK. Sancella products were distributed by Scott, but this was reviewed after the company's merger.
</UL>
Tambrands has relocated its UK sales and marketing operation to its headquarters in Woking, Surrey. The agreement with Sancella will be complete by the end of April.

<H3><B>Searle pilots pharmacy support scheme</B></H3>
<P>
Searle Pharmaceuticals is spearheading an educational initiative in Croydon in a joint venture agreed through the local pharmaceutical committee.
<P>
As an extension of an existing educational support scheme for doctors called Searlecare, the company has decided to take it one step further, says medical editorial manager Karen Tait. "We feel that community pharmacists need the support and this is obviously something we can offer them."
<P>
Under the pilot project, all 72 pharmacists within Croydon Family Health Services Authority are to be offered a range of Searle-funded educational services. Pharmacists will choose from a list of five suggestions at a meeting next week, although all services will be available if the demand is there.
<P>
The first option is to offer all contractors an in-pharmacy health video library consisting of in-house Searle titles and pharmacist-requested topics. The service will be free, although pharmacists may elect to charge a small deposit to ensure return of borrowed videos, says Croydon LPC chairman Andrew McCoig. 
<P>
The participating pharmacists could also receive a Colour MIMS Index to aid identification of branded tablets. In addition, Searle is prepared to print and publish practice leaflets; provide information technology training in word processing, Windows and accounting; and give training in how to handle the new system of complaints procedures.
<P>
Feedback from Croydon pharmacists will determine whether the project is expanded. "If it is successful, then the intention is to look at where it would be useful," says Ms Tait. 
<P>
Mr McCoig says the project is very much a partnership approach and he is hopeful of an "excellent" attendance at next week's meeting. 
<P>
"It's a very bold project and, as there are no cost implications for pharmacists involved, I am eagerly anticipating what the response is going to be," says Mr McCoig.

<H3><B><I>Which?</I> blasts pharmacists' advice: to oppose more POM to Ps</B></H3>
<P>
Incorrect drugs or advice were given in nearly half of pharmacies visited by covert Which? researchers, reveals the Consumers' Association magazine's latest investigation.
<P>
In a survey of 50 pharmacies around the UK published this week, investigators revealed that the wrong OTC medicine was sold in 14 out of 30 cases and in 15 instances patients were not referred to a GP.
<P>
Stating that pharmacies can't cope with the "sheer pace of change" in the OTC sector, Which? asked for named drugs or advice for five complaints:
<P>
<UL>
<LI> Nurofen requested by a woman on methotrexate - seven out of ten pharmacies sold the product, with no questions asked in two cases and failure to query asthmatic status in 40 per cent.
<LI> Canestan requested by woman who had not used the product or experienced thrush before, who also had lower stomach pain, an indicator of pelvic inflammatory disease - GP referral in one case, no questions asked in two instances and in 60 per cent the cream variant was sold, "the least effective preparation."
<LI>Tagamet requested by a middle-aged man with his first indigestion attack, also on Phyllocontin - product sold in two out of ten cases, an alternative in seven cases and one GP referral.
<LI>Patient returned from Far East with recurring diarrhoea lasting several weeks - GP referral in seven out of ten cases, in two no referral and Imodium sold.
<LI>Patient on amitryptyline re-questing something for hayfever - terfenadine sold in five out of ten cases, with two pharmacists aware of amitryptyline use.</LI>
</UL>
Which? senior editor Charlotte Gann says: "The service is still not up to scratch. We want conclusive evidence that pharmacists are giving out the right advice." She adds that, until the organisation's concerns have been fully addressed, it will "oppose any further switches of medicines off prescription."
<p>
The Royal Pharmaceutical Society says it does not agree with all the report's conclusions, in particular criticism of the level and content of advice given and the provision of products "that it would have been perfectly proper for the pharmacist to supply in all the circumstances".
<P>
The Society believes it shows the public could have confidence in pharmacists, "who were clearly asking for more information from people requesting a medicine by name". But it is concerned where pharmacists are not asking any questions of people requesting OTC medicines.
<P>
The National Pharmaceutical Association's director, Tim Astill, agrees that there is room for improvement, but points out  that the ibuprofen and methotrexate interaction is "pretty rare", with most pharmacists having to look this up.
<P>
He adds: "Some 80 per cent of pharmacists refused to sell Tagamet. I wonder how many other retailers would refuse a sale?"
<P> 
Mr Astill welcomed the CA's advice to consumers to ask questions in the pharmacy. "We accept that the pharmacist and assistant should ask questions, but equally there is an obligation for customers to do the same."
<P> 
The report comes hot on the heels of a Radio 4 "You and Yours" report, which indicated pharmacy protocols are not being employed adequately. According to the programme, only 18 out of 40 pharmacists asked any questions when reporters requested Diflucan One or Do-Do tablets.
WWHAM questioning was used in only one of 40 pharmacies, with less than half asking any appropriate questions at all.

<H3><B><A NAME="d"></A>CPP accreditation for C&D's Pharmacy Update features</B></H3>
<P>
Chemist & Druggist has gained accreditation for its Pharmacy Update distance learning for pharmacists from the College of Pharmacy Practice.
<P>
Appearing in the first and third issues of every month will be a number of features carrying the College logo. They will be linked to a set of multiple choice questions (MCQs) carried in the second issue of the following month, designed to test knowledge uptake and retention.
<P>
Each feature will indicate how many hours of continuing education it is worth. There will be at least three hours every month. Completion of the 12 monthly modules will provide a minimum of 30 hours' continuing education, sufficient to meet the Royal Pharmaceutical Society's suggested annual target of 30 hours.
<P>
The first set of MCQs will appear in C&D February 9. Full details of the marking system, which will give a means of verifying a pharmacist's participation, will be provided shortly.
<P>
C&D has always sought to provide a comprehensive package for its community pharmacist subscribers, and our move to gain accreditation for Pharmacy Update keeps us at the forefront of developments in this area. Accreditation of Pharmacy Update is a natural ex-tension of the Cambridge Counterpart Pharmacy Assistants Course, co-sponsored by Whitehall Laboratories, which has been running monthly in C&D since last June.

<H3><B>Nutricia faces price controls</B></H3>
<P>
Nutricia will be required to restrict the prices of its gluten-free and low-protein foods after a report by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
<P>
The decision comes after Nutricia's merger with Valio International UK, now known as Scientific Hospital Supplies, last February. The MMC approved the merger and concluded that it would not have any effect on the enteral clinical nutrition product market. However, it expressed concern over Nutricia's market share for gluten-free and low-protein products. 
<P>
The merger gave Nutricia 88 per cent of the gluten-free and low-protein food markets - over 90 per cent for certain products, including breads, rolls and flour mixes.
<P>
The Commission has recommended that Nutricia should raise prices by no more than the change in the retail price index, minus 2 per cent, for the next four years.

<H3><B>C&D's Counterpart assistant training gains accreditation</B></H3>
<P>
Chemist & Druggist's Cambridge Counterpart Counter Assistant Development Programme has now been accredited by the College of Pharmacy Practice.
<P>
This means counter assistants successfully completing the course and having satisfactory communication skills meet the Royal Pharmaceutical Society's training requirements.
<P>
Certificates will be issued by the CPP (via course providers) to assistants who have satisfactorily completed an accredited course. There will be a 5 fee.
<P>
Six other courses have been accredited, each for three years. They are:
<P>
<UL>
 <LI>Medicines Counter Assistants Course (Buttercups Training)
 <LI>Medicines Counter Assistants Course (Lloyds)
 <LI>Medicines Counter Assistants Course (NPA) revised February, 1996
 <LI>Pharmacy Counter Assistant Development Programme (Pragmatic Training)
 <LI>Pharmacy Interact  (NPA)
 <LI>The Healthcare Assistant's Course (Boots).
</UL>
<P>
Course lengths vary between a few weeks and 18 months.
<P>
Accreditation details had not been released by CPP as C&D went to press, but it is anticipated that independent verification of candidates' course progress will be a condition for certification.
<P>
Registration with C&D's telephone marking system is one successful method of independent assessment already in use. Further information on how to join this scheme, and details of alternative marking methods, will be published in next week's issue.

<H3><B>Nine out of ten pass Society's first assistant examination</B></H3>
<P>
A 92.7 per cent pass rate has been achieved by the 2,657 "experienced assistants" who undertook the Royal Pharmaceutical Society's exam on January 25.
<P>
The results were sent out to supervising pharmacists this week. Candidates who narrowly failed the January sitting have been automatically re-registered for the second exam on May 23.
<P>
Those who failed by a wide margin have been advised to undertake an approved training course, although they can contact the Society to register for the next exam on May 23, with a final opportunity to sit on November 14.
<P>
Applications to sit the May exam should be made in writing to Room 309, RPSGB, 1 Lambeth High Street, London SE1 7JN by April 1. Applications received after this date will be registered for the November exam. 
<P>
Since a maximum of two attempts are permitted, pharmacists are encouraged to register their experienced assistants for the May exam. 
<P>
Papers for the May exam will be sent to supervising pharmacists on May 20. The 30-minute test will consist of 55 multiple choice questions and five case studies requiring true/false answers. The pass mark will be 80 per cent. An information pack containing the candidate's registration number, instructions and sample questions will be forwarded in mid-April.
<P>
The test can be taken at any time in the nominated pharmacy on May 23, under the strict control of the supervising pharmacist. Completed exam papers must be returned by May 24 together with a 10 exam fee and a declaration that the candidate meets the experience requirements for entering.Results and certificates will be despatched to supervising pharmacists by July 1.

<H3><B>PSNC rejects new 2.8% NHS pay offer</B></H3>
<P>
The Department of Health has made English and Welsh contractors a second pay offer of a 2.8 per cent increase in the global sum for 1996/97. The Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee is to reject the "unacceptable" offer, with the backing of the Local Pharmaceutical Committee Conference.
<P>
PSNC chairman David Sharpe is "cautiously optimistic" that the DoH will make a third offer within the next two to three weeks. "I think we are in protracted negotiations, but we will not accept this offer as it stands."
<P>
Godfrey Horridge, PSNC's financial executive, adds that this offer does not touch upon stipulations on script fees and professional allowance.
<P>
The letter admits that pharmacists' remuneration fell by 6 per cent in real terms between 1987-88 and 1995-96, but adds that the choice of base year is critical.
<P>
The offer was the subject of much debate at the LPC Conference, with PSNC member Hemant Patel pointing out that the 29 per cent increase in productivity seen since 1987-88 means "you are working free of charge for the DoH for 87 working days. That's January, February, March and ten days in April".
<P>
He called for the profession to tell the DoH "enough is enough, we are not prepared to accept this kind of rubbish" and also to "seriously consider taking very strident and even undignified action".
<P>
He suggested campaigning for a pharmacy review body via a three-pronged attack: petitioning the public; getting the public to send postcards to their MPs calling for a pay review body; and a vigil outside the secretary of state Stephen Dorrell's house. 
<P>
Suggestions from other delegates included: pharmacists working only their basic contracted hours; refusing to collect the prescription charge; initiating a petition to raise public awareness; and delegates walking en masse to Parliament.

<H3><B>David Sharpe to retire from PSNC chairmanship</B></H3>
<P>
The Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee chairman, David Sharpe, is retiring. "In these 18 years, I have made many friends and, I think, I have made a few enemies," Mr Sharpe announced at this week's Local Pharmaceutical Committee Conference (see p298).
<P>
As a National Pharmaceutical Association-nominated member of the PSNC, it was known that Mr Sharpe would step down once he retired from the NPA in 1998, although he will remain on the Committee until then.
<P>
Stephen Axon, PSNC secretary, says: "There is no doubt he will be missed because he has made such a tremendous contribution to the Committee."
<P>
The chairman of the National Pharmaceutical Association, Tim Astill, praises Mr Sharpe: "David Sharpe's contribution to the progress and wellbeing of pharmacy is incalculable. His decision to step down as chairman of PSNC marks the end of an era in NHS negotiations. He will be a hard act to follow."
<P>
Colleagues at the Local Pharmaceutical Committee Conference were quick to laud his work.
<P>
Hemant Patel, fellow PSNC and Council member, said: "Without him I could not have gone into pharmacy politics." Liverpool LPC chairman Jeremy Clitherow commented: "He has been an invaluable asset to the profession." Essex LPC chairman Bharat Patel was saddened by the announcement. "The man has put 18 years of thinking about pharmacy first. I think he has been a friend of pharmacy." Bradford's Ian Conquest was also sad. "He is loved and hated in various groups, but you can't doubt his ability."
<P>
The majority of those C&D spoke to tipped PSNC vice chairman Wally Dove for the top post. Mr Sharpe is the longest serving PSNC chairman.

<H3><B>Lloyds bid goes to Monopolies Commission</B></H3>
<P>
The Unichem bid for Lloyds Chemists has been referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
<P>
The decision means that the offer lapses until the outcome of the enquiry. The MMC must make its report by June 28. The UK authorities have also called on the European Commission to allow them to examine the rival Gehe offer for Lloyds. This falls under the jurisdiction of the EC Merger Regulations at the moment. The Commission has three weeks to respond to this request.
<P>
It is only the second time that the UK has requested that a case be referred back from the EC. In 1992, the Commission referred back the proposed merger of the building materials businesses of Tarmac and Steetley. Jeffery Harris, Unichem's chief executive, says that the company is "very surprised and naturally very disappointed" at the news.
<P>
"We strongly believe that the proposed acquisition will improve the efficiency of the distribution service to the independent pharmacist, and that the creation of a larger retailing chain will improve the competitiveness of our service," he said.
<P>
Shares in Lloyds fell by 24p to 459p, reflecting concerns that  the deal could now be drawn out for several months and that the MMC's enquiry could bar both Unichem and Gehe from their goal. Unichem shares fell 3p to 243p, reducing the value of its cash and shares bid.
<P>
When Unichem first made its move for Lloyds, it believed that it could satisfy the competition authorities with its plans to dispose of several wholesaling depots. However, the Department of Trade and Industry says that the deal raises concerns in the UK wholesale and retail pharmaceutical markets.
<P>
Unichem comments that it remains confident about the outcome of the enquiry and is "very keen" to complete the deal.
<P>
Meanwhile, the Gehe bid for Lloyds still stands, although it is widely expected to be only a matter of time before this is also referred. Gehe sent out its offer document to Lloyds' shareholders last Wednesday.

<H3><B>Nomad marketing falls foul of NPA</B></H3>
<P>
The National Pharmaceutical Association is warning its members about Surgichem's marketing methods for its Nomad medicines administration system. Surgichem, however, has vigorously defended its position.
<P>
The NPA says that despite its attempts to encourage Surgichem to work with its members, the company continues to make direct approaches to managers of nursing and residential homes. This compromises the position of pharmacists providing services to those establishments, the NPA believes.
<P>
Surgichem's approach effectively forces NPA members either to relinquish the business or to provide the Nomad system free of charge, concluded the NPA Board, meeting in February.
<P>
"Any possibility of negotiating a fee or the supply of a less costly MDS system was undermined by Surgichem's approach," says the Board.
<P>
Not only are approaches to the homes being made by Surgichem representatives without informing the supplying pharmacist but the company is also claiming NPA endorsement for such activity, continues the Board.
<P>
Surgichem managing director Norman Niven says he is shocked by the tone of the NPA's comments. Two complaints passed on by the NPA last year have been investigated, but both cases were beyond the company's control.
<P>
"The MDS market is a tough one and is driven by Boots. We need to maintain a certain level of activity to support Nomad and the independent pharmacist, many of whom are NPA members," says Mr Niven.
<P>
When presenting to care homes, Surgichem actively encourages the involvement of the pharmacist who services that home. This move was supported by the NPA, but there are times when the home will not give their names or want them involved.

<H3><B>US number one vitamin launched in UK by Whitehall</B></H3>
<P>
Centrum, the number one multivitamin supplement in the US, is being launched in the UK by Whitehall Laboratories.
<P>
The formula of 29 vitamins and minerals from A through to zinc also contains the complete antioxidant group of nutrients, folic acid and micro-nutrients. It has been adapted from the US formula and provides 15 vitamins and minerals at 100 per cent of the EC Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA), which the company says is more than any other brands currently on the market. Centrum is sugar- and lactose-free, and is also suitable for coeliac sufferers, as it is gluten-free.
<P>
Centrum is available in packs of 30 and 60 tablets, which retail at 3.89 and 6.95. A five-sided carton was selected to allow the maximum information to be displayed on-pack. Whitehall is offering stockists a POR of 33 per cent and standard discounts.
<P>
The total promotional spend for the launch of Centrum is 3 million, which will include TV, radio and press advertising. GPs and other members of the primary healthcare team will be targeted in a "recommender' programme. Point of sale material will include counter display units and information leaflets.
<P>
A nutritional advisory board, consisting of a GP, a pharmacist, a nutritionist and a health visitor, has been set up to advise the company on new clinical developments and current thinking on vitamin and mineral supplementation.
<P>
Product manager Jo Stopp says the new product is intended to remove confusion and make the selection of the right formula easy for everyone. <I>Whitehall Laboratories Ltd. Tel: 01628 669011.</I>

<H3><B>PACT course put into practice</B></H3>
<P>

At least two pharmacists who completed a course on PACT analysis and formulary production at Aston University this summer are already putting their knowledge into practice. Eli Lilly & Co, which sponsored the independently-taught course, is hoping to sponsor another in the first half of next year.
<P>
Lindsey Fairbrother, who works for the Co-op in Stoke-on-Trent, has gained funding from the health authority to spend her half day off helping a local surgery. She has had three meetings with the GPs, looking at their PACT data and suggesting ways they can save money. She has produced an antibiotics formulary, restricting prescribing to three- or five-day courses. The next step is to help make the practice's repeat prescribing process more efficient.
<P>
'I'm very pleased at the way things are going,'' she told C&D. 'Hopefully, now I'm at the surgery every week they will see me as part of the team.''
<P>
Caroline Galloway of Galloway's Pharmacy, Coventry, is working with a local surgery on PACT analysis and formulary development. She hopes to prove to the GPs that a pharmacist's input is worthwhile so they will then pay for her advice on a regular basis. She feels there is potential for a pharmacist's input at the surgery on at least half a day a week.
<P>
Other pharmacists who were on the course are making preliminary contacts with GPs. They met recently for the first in a series of quarterly updates at which they share experiences and receive further training on specific therapeutic areas.
<P>
The course at Aston University, which runs one day a week for five weeks, usually costs 300. Course organiser Sue Lunec told C&D that pharmacists whose local GPs had already expressed interest in advice on prescribing could try approaching the local health authority for funding. She hoped other universities would consider running similar courses in the future. Further details are available on 0121 359 3611 ext 4202.
<P>
Lilly's project development pharmacist, Andrew Platten, said that the company's representatives were often asked by GPs for help with PACT analysis and formulary work. There was now a pool of independently-trained pharmacists to whom they could be referred.

<H3><B>High-cost drug list proposed</B></H3>
<P>

Barnet Health Authority is to consider 'establishing a list of high-cost drugs which could be the subject of a separate contract'.The move, which is listed in its Purchasing Plan for 1997/98, comes with a proposed increase in the extra-contractual referral budget for high-cost prescriptions, such as for beta-interferon.
<P>
Pharmacists can also expect to see an HA-funded project to enable them to 'take a full part in health promotion and pursuit of the Health of the Nation targets'. These will concentrate on smoking prevention, obesity and physical activity to improve coronary heart disease figures.
<P>
Drugs awareness training may be given to health professionals, including pharmacists, as part of the Effectiveness Review of Services for Drug Misusers established by the Department of Health in May.

<H3><B>Diagnosis at the touch of a button</B></H3>
<P>

A touch-screen medical information system for patients and customers is to be developed for community pharmacies. Hadley Hutt Computing will also trial the system in doctors' waiting rooms.
<P>
Intouch with Health carries a much wider range of information than similar systems, covering medical conditions, surgical operations, an A-Z of the NHS, health news (including surgery/pharmacy and local health authority information), support groups (local and national), travel clinic (vaccinations, Government advice, etc), healthy living (Health Education Authority guidance) and health directories (a Yellow Pages of local complementary therapists and health services).
<P>
The Intouch unit is similar in size to a pharmacy personal weighing machine, with a privacy screen for viewing only by someone standing directly in front. Information provided on medical conditions is 'part of the body'-based and is intended to supplement the GP's diagnosis, not to be a diagnostic tool in itself. In preliminary trials, the doctor tells one in four patients to use the system after the consultation (a printout of the on-screen advice is available, and this can be charged for at the discretion of the doctor or pharmacist). 
<P>
Medication data is currently being added to Intouch, so that patients will be able to take away the equivalent of the patient information leaflet (PIL) pioneered in dispensary systems by Hadley Hutt. All data is updated nightly via ISDN lines. 
<P>
Sections of the database are interlinked so that the user can switch, for example, from the description of a surgical operation to recommended books, a video on recovery, and contacts for any local support group. Some health messages are reinforced by animated video clips.
<P>
When trials are completed, Intouch will be available for outright purchase plus data subscription, or on lease. However, health authorities have indicated an interest in funding the savings in GPs' time, and there are opportunities for sponsorship and advertising on the system which the UK developer, Brann, believes should make it self-financing.
<P>
Midlands' community and hospital pharmacists who saw the system recently gave the idea an enthusiastic welcome and endorsed additional pharmacy facilities resulting from experience with the system in the US and other countries. Hadley Hutt Computing can be contacted on 01905 795335.

<H3><B>Caught up in the net of the future</B></H3>
<P>

As more and more business is conducted electronically, even the greatest technophobe must admit that the Internet is set to have a huge impact on future electronic commerce. John Axtell, group IT director of Boots, predicts that his company will be dependent on the Internet for its success in the future. Information exchange is the key to developing partnerships with suppliers, wholesalers and trading partners worldwide through Internet technology, he says.
<P>
The traditional electronic exchange of documents in a structured form (EDI or electronic data interchange) is largely irrelevant when communicating with the wider business community, Mr Axtell continues. EDI is most commonly used for purchasing, EPoS, distribution, orders and invoices. It is generally costly for the smaller business, such as a pharmacy, as the retailer and the supplier both need compatible hardware and software to be able to communicate, and these systems tend to be cost prohibitive.
<P>
Boots, which has the largest EPoS system in Europe, is developing its own secure site on the Internet, rather than continue working on costly bespoke systems. Sharing information with business partners, says Mr Axtell, leads to cost savings, improved customer relations and greater efficiency.
<P>
The Electronic Commerce Association has a Health Interest Section, which is divided into two sub-groups: the Healthcare group promotes the use of electronic commerce techniques within the healthcare industry; the Health Trade group promotes the use of EDI and other electronic commerce technologies within the health trade industry, raising the awareness of the benefits of EDI applications. For further details, telephone 0171 432 2500.
<P>
Mr Axtell believes retailers that can operate without stores will be the winners in the future - for example, home shopping with home delivery. Whether he sees Boots travelling along this path is a matter for debate. The implications for pharmacy are also far-reaching.

Pharmacy is a massively under-used resource which the Liberal Democrats is determined to exploit to the full, said Mike Hadley, a pharmacist and health spokesman for the Party, as he unveiled its policy on pharmacy. 'The profession and Government need to work together to show that it is in the public interest to develop pharmacy as a pivotal professional service throughout healthcare.'
<P>
The Party's pharmacy policy  recognised particular areas in pharmacy that it wanted to develop and support to ensure cost-effective and safe use of medicines. But it also recognised that a remuneration package based on the services provided by each pharmacist was central to achieving this. 
<P>
'I believe there should be a standard basic salary supplemented by payments for every value service offered to patients and an additional element to reflect experience and expertise,' he said. Mr Hadley stressed that the Party was against abolishing Resale Price Maintenance and would only change its position if safeguards were put in place.
<P>
The Liberal Democrats policy on pharmacy includes:
<UL>
<LI>contributing to the Health of the Nation through management of prescribed medicines, chronic conditions and common ailments; promotion and support of healthy lifestyles; and being an information provider
<LI>encouraging pharmacist support by adequate training and education
<LI>establishing how pharmacists can contribute professionally in a competitive environment
<LI>raising public awareness of the pharmacist's role
<LI>encouraging POM to P switches
<LI>permitting generic substitution
<LI>encouraging use of technology
<LI>encouraging the RPSGB to review its policy on standards for pharmacy premises and practice.

<H3><B>US group plans 400 UK health stores</B></H3>
<P>

A US group - the General Nutrition Center - plans to open 400 health and vitamin stores in the UK. The group is valued at about $1.6 billion and is believed to be the market leader in the $5bn US health products market. 
<P>
Its 40 million investment programme for the UK, which is expected to create up to 2,000 jobs, has a target of six new stores before the end of the year, 60 by the end of next year and 300 by 1999.
<P>
The first of these, a 1,000sq ft outlet bearing the initials GNC (General Nutrition Center), was opened in Bristol last week. Another store opened in Oxford this week and a third is to open soon in Bath.
<P>
Lines in each store include vitamins, sports products, homoeopathy products, herbal medicines, drinks and formulas. The company does not stock medicines, however. Each store will be equipped with a touch-screen computer monitor to help customers choose lines that best suit their needs.
<P>
The UK business is headed by Margaret Peet, whose father founded the Health & Diet Group, a chain of 20 shops that GNC acquired for about 5m last year. 
<P>
Meanwhile, the US parent company is interested in acquiring Lloyds Chemists' Holland & Barrett healthfood stores. Lloyds bidder Unichem this week talked to all the parties interested in acquiring the chain. Bid rival Gehe has not ruled out selling Holland & Barrett if its move for Lloyds succeeds.
<P>
Holland & Barrett has close to 400 stores and is one of the better-performing groups in Lloyds' portfolio. The chain's profits grew 7.5 per cent to a record 7.8m for the year to June 30. Its turnover rose by 17.5 per cent to 90.6m.

<H3><B>ABPI broadens its appeal</B></H3>
<P>

The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry is broadening its appeal by creating a new 'affiliate membership' category. The move is intended to allow organisations, such as 'research boutiques', advertising agencies and finance houses, to benefit from the Association's expertise.
<P>
Interested parties face a membership fee of around 5,000. It is hoped that the initiative will be under way by Christmas.
<P>

<li>The pharmaceutical industry will approve the code of practice proposed by the Department of Health for disease management schemes.A consultation letter published in May and revised recently indicated how the DoH saw company-sponsored initiatives with health authorities being managed. 
<P>
Initially, the DoH wants to see pilot schemes developed on a local basis, and the industry will be happy to go along with that, says ABPI director Trevor Jones.

<H3><B>Company in focus: Kenneth R. Rutter</B></H3>
<P>

<STRONG> Who's he?</STRONG> Not who, but what. It's a chain of five pharmacies in Leeds and Harrogate, named after its founder, Kenneth Rutter. He opened his first pharmacy in 1947 and found time to become chairman of the National Pharmaceutical Association and a board member of Unichem before it became a plc. The chain's current managing director is Richard Rutter, his son. The company proudly boasts the ISO 9002 award for companies that have achieved rigorous standards of quality.
<P>
<STRONG>Why did Richard apply for it?</STRONG> Four years ago, while sitting as a pharmacy representative on a service case, he heard a complainant suggest that pharmacies needed quality procedures similar to those of BS5750. Richard liked that idea. He liked it even more when he found that the Department of Trade and Industry's Enterprise Initiative could help him financially to attain the award.
<P>
<STRONG>What did he do?</STRONG> First, Richard employed Modulus Consultancy to conduct an in-depth review of the chain and to draft a quality manual. All pharmacies, he says, should already have quality systems and built-in checking systems. Modulus Consultancy noted and related the chain's procedures to the requirements of the ISO 9002 standard. A number of Rutter's procedures were modified.
<P>
As Rutter's pharmacists were involved throughout the accreditation process, they found it easier to adopt the new procedures. Fifty per cent of the consultancy's fee was paid by the DTI. As an alternative, Richard could have attended a course of advisory meetings and written the quality manual 'in-house'.
<P>
<STRONG>How long did the process take?</STRONG> Two years.
<P>
<STRONG>Has ISO 9002 helped his chain?</STRONG> Richard says its dispensing process has become more accountable. As the ISO 9002 standard requires uniform procedures in the pharmacies, it helps relief pharmacists and it ensures that all procedures are consistent and identifies faults in the performance of its suppliers. He has also seen improvements on control of orders, credit requests and stock management.
<P>
<STRONG>Would it help me?</STRONG> Richard says: 'The ISO 9002 is becoming increasingly necessary for businesses which want to secure contracts with local authorities. In future, health authorities may also decide that ISO 9002 is an assurance that quality proceedings are in place, adhered to and can be monitored.'

<H3><B>SB to undertake major pharmacy training drive</B></H3>
<P>

Smithkline Beecham is setting up a programme to improve the retailing skills of pharmacists and their staff. The company has spent 500,000 on getting the scheme off the ground, including research that suggests that many pharmacists want to develop their business management and 'people' skills. It is currently running a pilot operation with six independent pharmacies. 
<P>
SB is finding out how many pharmacists want to be involved and it is determining how they would like to be taught. The completed scheme could offer various options, such as interactive workshops and audio cassettes. The company aims to ensure its courses are accredited by top professional bodies. It says it is too early to reveal any names.
<P>
Caroline Carter, SB's commercial education manager, says it wants to develop a more 'pro-active' approach to training pharmacists. 'Companies like ourselves must be more imaginative, instead of just talking about our own strengths,' she says. Pharmacists who want to be involved should contact Ms Carter on 0181 975 4400.

<H3><B>PHS launches expanded health promotion service</B></H3>
<P>
The Pharmacy Healthcare Scheme is introducing new services following its successful tender for Department of Health monies for health promotion through pharmacies.
<P>
''Winning the three-year tender,'' says the scheme's vice chairman, Colette McCreedy, ''has allowed us to build on the activities already in existence, which will help build on the pharmacist's role in health promotion.''
<P>
As well as producing a minimum of eight leaflets a year, PHS will also supply pharmacists with additional campaign information, such as posters, information sheets and booklets, and a twice-yearly newsletter. A leaflet re-ordering service will be available with a nominal 2.50 handling charge to cover postage and packing.
<P>
The PHS will also target health authority purchasers by offering a catalogue of its services and a disk library of the leaflets available to ease access. It will also undertake an evaluation programme involving pharmacist questionnaires for every leaflet and campaign and a questionnaire for decision-makers.
<P>
Plans to develop the health promotion arena in pharmacy will be based on the recommendations of two groups: one comprising pharmaceutical advisers and health authority decision-makers, which will devise a model for progressing community pharmacy-based health promotion; the second, communication experts who will try and produce a solution to the barriers of health promotion in pharmacy. The outcome will be subject to pharmacy peer review.
<P>
The final thrust is to set up centres of excellence by encouraging pioneer pharmacists to advise their colleagues. The scheme will operate through pharmacies in England, Wales and Northern Ireland; negotiations are under way to bring Scotland on board.
<P>
The leaflet programme for the rest of the year is: care of the elderly (July), medication and the elderly (September), depression and the elderly (October), safer sex 'cover up' and contraception for teenagers (December), healthy lifestyles for a healthy heart (January) and no smoking: lung cancer (February/March). 
<P>
The aim is to fund five of the leaflets with DoH money and the rest through sponsorship. The scheme is looking for the latter from companies and other bodies.

<H3><B>Tesco planning targets 'neighbourhood' ruling</B></H3>
<P>
Tesco is using the recent High Court ruling on what constitutes a neighbourhood in its application to open several new pharmacies (<EM>C&D</EM> June 1, p753). Pharmacy superintendent Mike Rudin says: ''We have applied for a contract at Wilmslow and have also placed a number of other applications under Justice Tucker's ruling.''
<P>
The judge ruled that a shopping centre can be considered a neighbourhood, entitled to be served by its own pharmacy in a test case brought by Boots the Chemists. The ruling is ''one of the most interesting decisions to come out of the High Courts in a long time'', says Mr Rudin. He is keen to see where the limits of definition of neighbourhood are drawn and what the ruling of 'necessary and desirable' means. 
<P>
The judge's decision has come shortly before new Department of the Environment guidelines on town planning, which were published last week. The Government's first objective outlined in 'Planning Policy Guidance', revised June, 1996, is ''to sustain and enhance the vitality and viability of town centres''. 
<P>
Although not binding, the guidelines ask local authorities to ''encourage appropriately-sized, local supermarkets and seek to retain post offices and pharmacies in existing district and local centres and discourage their inclusion in out of centre retail developments by imposing appropriate conditions''.

<H3><B>Asda buys nine Moss pharmacies</B></H3>
<P>
 It has been confirmed this week that Asda is to acquire nine pharmacies from the Unichem-owned Moss chain (<EM>C&D</EM> June 29, p900). Four of the pharmacies - at North Pentwyn, Hinckley, Great Yarmouth and Grimsby - have been open for less than a year. They are all mid-store pharmacies and it is understood that Moss has found it difficult operating such units. Most Moss outlets in Asda are positioned outside the checkout.
<P>
The other outlets have not yet opened under the Moss name, but it is understood they do have contracts. Although the deal has been agreed in principle, no official transfer date has been fixed. Asda said that it had purchased ten pharmacies at the announcement of its annual results last Thursday. 
<P>
These pharmacies are the first to be owned wholly by Asda and form part of its strategy to have a pharmacy in each of half of its 207 stores. It already has 85 pharmacy franchises sited on Asda premises. The sale of further Moss outlets to Asda in the immediate future is understood to be highly unlikely.

<H3><B>Pharmacist wholesaling co-op sets up in borders</B></H3>
<P>
A new wholesalers' co-operative run by independent pharmacists is due to commence business in the Borders area. The Carlisle-based Border Chemists Alliance has been registered as a company, and aims to offer a 'full-line' service in southern Scotland, north east England, Cumbria and north Lancashire. 
<P>
Plans are advanced for an early autumn operational start date. Over 70 independent pharmacists have signed up to the new co-op. A full business plan has been approved and supported by the Royal Bank of Scotland. The company also has options on several sites for depots. 
<P>
''Many independent pharmacists are feeling threatened by the big wholesalers,'' says chairman Jeremy Aspden. ''BCA will protect the pharmacists' independence, as it will be owned by members and run for them.
<P>
''There is a strong tradition of regional-based wholesalers in the North West,'' he adds. The possibility that the Daniels' wholesale company may disappear if Lloyds Chemists is bought by Gehe or Unichem has focused attention on it being ''the time for independents to become more independent'', he says.
<P>
The new wholesaler has the support of most of manufacturers, says Mr Aspden. It is also considering negotiating to become a Numark appointed wholesaler. Six other members will be appointed to the board to give regional representation. The BCA can be contacted via Mr Apsden's pharmacy at 132 Highgate, Kendal LA9 4HE. Tel: 01539 733353.

<H3><B>Boots to spend 300m on developing healthcare role</B></H3>
<P>
Boots the Chemists intends to make its pharmacists ''more accessible'' in a 300 million investment over the next four years. The company is to target the 45 per cent of people who suffer in silence rather than self-medicate with an OTC medicine. Boots is also establishing seven different pharmacy formats tailored to the needs of local customers.
<P>
 The trial of the Advantage loyalty card is being extended and the company is looking at ways of using 'smart card' technology to transfer repeat prescriptions from GP surgeries to pharmacies.
<P>
David Kneale, director of merchandise and marketing, said this week that one aim was to free pharmacists to spend more time with customers. While pharmacists would still supervise dispensing, some of the more routine procedures would be delegated to trained technicians. 
<P>
Boots was considering how counselling areas could be kept away from products and one possibility might be to have separate consulting rooms. Other plans to develop Boots' healthcare role included in-store advertising to target the 'non-treaters' and the 20 per cent of people who go to a GP rather than a pharmacy for advice on minor ailments.
<P>
 The company would continue to develop own-brands of OTC medicines and a new range to be launched next month would target different types of pain, such as dental pain, back pain, etc. Mr Kneale went on to describe how the company was using the power of the Boots' brand to encourage customer loyalty in prescription medicines. Eighty lines using the Boots name in association with a branded medicine, such as Boots Tagamet and Boots Floxapen, had already been launched. 
<P>
Other dispensing initiatives included looking at ways to transfer repeat prescription management from the GP to the pharmacy of the patient's choice. In-store services would be set up for those with chronic conditions, such as asthma. Ron Glaister, director of stores, told the press briefing that 70m would be spent this year on expanding the chain and developing existing stores; 130 of the 240 proposed new small stores had already opened and a further 40 would follow on this year. Eighteen central London branches would be significantly upgraded.
<P>
Three edge of town stores - in Salford, Bromborough and Cheshunt - had opened and there would soon be three more in Croydon, Craighleith (Edinburgh) and Fort Dunlop. Existing Boots' branches had not been 'cannibalised' by these openings so sales had probably been taken from grocery outlets. About a dozen edge of town branches will be opened over the next three years.
<P>
Managing director Steve Russell reiterated the company's commitment to the High Street, but said Boots wanted to be represented in out of town centres if that's where the customers were. Mr Glaister went on to explain that, until recently, the size of the store was the main factor in determining the merchandise offered, but sophisticated computer systems now enabled individual branches to be tailored to customer profiles and product needs. Over the next two or three years, all stores would be merchandised according to seven formats:
<P>
<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>edge of town
<LI>travel pharmacies, which would be mostly at airports, where the accent would be on holiday merchandise
<LI>pharmacies in or near surgeries, which would focus on dispensing and OTC sales
<LI>work stores, situated in railway stations or near large working populations, catering for morning, lunchtime and evening peaks
<LI>pop-in stores (600) catering for 'top-up' shopping between major shopping trips
<LI>small destination stores (400), mainly in market towns, which would offer a wide choice
<LI>large destination stores (100) in main city shopping centres carrying a full product range.
</UL>
<P>
A large store is expected to open in Dublin this autumn, but the directors could give no more information on plans for overseas expansion other than that the company is investigating various possibilities in both developed and developing countries. Press reports that the company is poised to open a chain in Holland did not originate from Boots, said Mr Russell. ''We will say more when we have carefully analysed the opportunities,'' he said.

Unichem has appointed a board for its wholesale division to create ''an experienced management team dedicated to supporting the independent pharmacy sector''.
<P>
Keith Slater is promoted to director of management services, Cliff Irwin to director of finance and Tony Jackson to director of operations. Jeff Harris remains managing director of the division, with Chris Etherington as deputy managing director. Martyn Ward has been appointed director of sales and marketing on the board. He has dealt with other independent retail sectors for 16 years. 
<P>
Neil Chapman has been appointed as a non-executive director. Mr Chapman is also a member of Unichem's board and operates his own independent pharmacy. Mark Thomas has been promoted to the newly-created group post of director of corporate development.

<H3><B>Birmingham welfare milks scheme resurrected</B></H3>
<P>
Birmingham Health Authority has reintroduced its pharmacy welfare milks scheme, two years after the Local Pharmaceutical Committee advised its members to withdraw from it following a pay dispute. This time round, the service meets with LPC approval.
<P>
 ''The welfare scheme through pharmacy proved very popular and was convenient for patients. We are very happy to offer it again through pharmacies,'' says LPC chairman John Nicholls. The new deal offers the 106 participating pharmacies a 200 annual fee, provided the pharmacist and one counter assistant attend a training session; plus 0.50 for every infant formula tin distributed to Birmingham residents; and 0.10 for those given to non-residents.
<P>
 Pharmacists will be reimbursed on a monthly basis, with any savings accrued fed back to contractors. Mr Nicholls believes the scheme is unique in that the HA will supply all stock, meaning pharmacists will not be out of pocket. The decision to restart the scheme was made for two reasons, says the HA's commissioning manager, Anne Wanklin.
<P>
 ''We wanted to get as wide an access for users as possible and pharmacists were a good outlet for providing welfare milks and advice.'' In addition to this, new Department of Health reimbursement levels required the situation to be re-addressed.

<H3><B>Scots settle for 3.13 per cent increase</B></H3>
<P>

Pharmacists in Scotland have settled for a 3.13 per cent increase in the global sum for 1996-97, subject to urgent discussions on the mechanism by which remuneration for oxygen services and methadone dispensing will be transferred to local negotiations. The deal ties up loose ends going back over three years from 1994-95 to 1996-97.
<P>
 The core sum available for community pharmaceutical services in Scotland for 1996-97 is 74.12 million, but some short-term fee reductions are being made to avoid an overpayment which would otherwise happen by March. Although the Scottish Pharmaceutical General Council argued that at this late stage in the financial year it was impossible to balance the books, the Scottish Office was determined to avoid the overspend which would result if current fees and allow-ances were permitted to run.
<P>
To achieve the required balance by March 31, the following will happen:
<li>the lower threshold for payment of the professional allowance will rise to 1,100 items per month and the upper threshold to 2,860 items per month from December 1
<li>as part of the 1995-96 settlement, from April 1, 1996, there will no longer be separate payments for maintaining patient medication records, but keeping PMRs will be a requirement for the professional allowance. Transitional arrangements will apply for 1996-97 to contractors dispensing less than 1,000 items a month
<li>Controlled Drug fees will be abolished from December 1. Fees will not be paid for dispensing Schedule 3 CDs. All Schedule 2 CDs will attract a single 1.75 fee for each dispensing. CDs not in Schedule 2 will attract the standard dispensing fee of 88p. This is because the massive growth in methadone dispensing has put pressure on the global sum. The Scottish Office has credited the costs of additional storage for temazepam in CD cabinets
<li>the discount recovery base rate for 1996-97 will be 7.093 per cent, although the discount deduction scale will remain in force until the end of the fiscal year to avoid the overspend
<li>the oncost on stock orders (GP10A) will be reduced to 17.5 per cent from December 1. This is the first stage in the Scottish Office's intention to reduce oncost on stock orders to 5 per cent over the next three years
<li>the Scottish Office no longer considers that serial dispensing fees are an appropriate use of NHS resources. From December 1 to March 31, the second and subsequent serial dispensing of an item on any one prescription (except Schedule 2 CDs) will attract a fee of 22p. The Standing Committee believes that, under current financial pressures, it is more appropriate for contractors to negotiate additional payments directly with the homes they supply, but will be discussing with the Scottish Office how a serial dispensing service can be provided to appropriate groups of patients.
<P>
The Scottish Office intends to recover 450,000 for 1994-95 and 1995-96 and discussions are continuing on how this will be carried out. There will also be further discussions on the SCRIPTS project for computerised prescription pricing. The Scottish Pharmaceutical Standing Committee believes the settlement is an acceptable conclusion to a complex and protracted set of negotiations. 
<P>
Chairman Andrew Taylor told C&D this week: ''We can now move forward with a clean sheet to challenging negotiations on the White Paper and Pharmacy in a New Age proposals.''

<H3><B>PSNI's assistant training deadline</B></H3>
<P>

The Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland is reminding members that all medicine counter staff must have completed, or be enrolled on, an accredited training course by January 1. The Society has, subject to formal confirmation, appointed the College of Pharmacy Practice as the accrediting body for counter assistant courses. Northern Ireland pharmacists were appraised of the PSNI's professional requirement in a newsletter earlier this year, but the type of course was not specified. The position of experienced assistants has yet to be clarified. 
<P>
This latest development brings Northern Ireland in line with Great Britain and supports the requirement that all pharmacies must have had OTC protocols in place since January.Pharmacists requiring further information should contact Derek Lawson on 01232 326927.
<P>
<li> A training course on how to develop medicines protocols, organised by the Northern Ireland CPPET, is currently touring towns in the Province. Over the next two months, the course will be held in Omagh, Bushmills and Iniskillen (November 12), Portadown and Belfast (November 19). For details contact Dr Colin Adair on 01232 335800.

<H3><B>Queen's University intake in question</B></H3>
<P>

Queen's University School of Pharmacy is seeking to maintain its current student intake level despite there being no additional funding for the four-year degree course. Head of department Professor James McElnay is ''reasonably optimistic'' that the school will be able to keep the annual pharmacy intake at 65 students. However, numbers in other university departments may be affected. The alternative is to reduce the annual pharmacy intake by a quarter.
<P>
The Department of Education in Northern Ireland is being lobbied to give additional funding. Professor McElnay thinks that the new 'Primary Care' documents will mean other Governmental departments may also be prepared to lobby the DoE over funding.  He anticipates significant problems if there is a reduced output when the fourth year comes into being in 1999-2000. ''Any more cutbacks in manpower, through decreasing student numbers, will be detrimental to the profession,'' he says. As yet, the manpower situation in Northern Ireland is ''probably not quite as critical as in Great Britain, but it is becoming more and more acute''.
<P>
A decision is expected in the next fortnight so that A-level requirements for next year's intake can be agreed. At present, A-level passes of one grade A and two grade Bs are required. Professor McElnay says that A-level standards will have to be raised if places are cut, ''but there is not a lot of room for manoeuvre''.

<H3><B>Forging links: Practice to People Awards</B></H3>
<P>

A husband and wife team, who run an independent pharmacy in east London, won this year's Glaxo Wellcome/Chemist & Druggist Community Pharmacy Award: From Practice to People. Their example - and that of other entrants - bodes well for pharmacy in the New Age, said the judging panel
<P>
A detailed report of the judges' comments appears in C&amp;D this week.  The winning entries were:
<P>
<li> Husband and wife team <STRONG>Mahua Das and Ash Pandya</STRONG> met on a day trip to Margate. Mahua is a pharmacist who bought her first business - Health First (UK) in Walthamstow - just over five years ago. 
<P>
Ash trained as a microbiologist but his work in financial services gave him a good grounding in marketing and business skills. At first he was apprehensive about giving up his job to work in the pharmacy, but the dramatic improvement in prescription business has proved he made the right decision to become full-time practice manager.
<P>
''Mahua did not have the time to develop the business on her own. And pharmacists aren't always trained in the business skills required. Like fund-holding GPs, pharmacies need to have practice managers to develop other roles,'' he says. 
<P>
The couple are in regular contact with the local doctors' surgery, advising on prescribing and repeat medication, and have built up a dressings formulary with the practice nurse and district nurse. They also help monitor patient medication at three other surgeries. 
Ash has run health promotion activities, promoting community pharmacy to the public, and has formed a pharmacy practice group with a couple of other independents to carry out joint ethical marketing activities. The group plans to hire or sell equipment, such as TENS machines, nebulisers and glucose monitors, and is embarking on a diabetic screening project.
<P>
<li> <STRONG>Andrew McGuire</STRONG>, who manages the only pharmacy in Dunkeld, is collaborating with the local surgery in devising pharmaceutical care plans for patients. The scheme started in November last year, with a review of all patients on repeat prescriptions. Quality assurance is checked by an expert panel examining a representative sample of the care plans.
<P>
Andrew monitors patients on anticoagulant therapy using a Coagucheck device and adjusts the dose of anticoagulant within a range agreed with the GP. He also runs a blood monitoring service, measuring blood glucose, urea, creatinine and other parameters, to keep an eye on patients' progress within the agreed care plans.
<P>
His job satisfaction has increased by making more use of his pharmacy training and working together with the GPs and practice nurses, who now regard him ''more as a professional than a shopkeeper''.
<P>
<li> Julie Small, whose branch of Lloyds in Alfreton concentrates mainly on dispensing, wanted to make good use of a large front shop area. With support from South Derbyshire Health Authority, she set up the CHAT centre where customers can pick up information leaflets and get advice on many aspects of health and welfare services. CHAT stands for Community and local Healthcare, social and welfare Advice provided informally by Trained professional advisers. They include health visitors, social workers and representatives from agencies, such as Age Concern and Arthritis Care, which attend at specific times, and there is a regular pharmacist's advice session.
<P>
When the service started last January, the pharmacy distributed about 200 leaflets a week, which has since settled at about 100. Julie believes the pharmacy has taken on an important pivotal role in the move towards seamless community care.
<P>
<li> <STRONG>Hilary Edmondson</STRONG>, of the Hessle Road Moss branch in Hull, was commended for her survey of a local GP's elderly patients to resolve their medication problems. She is currently trying to encourage links between GPs and staff at day care centres who have to cope with elderly people's medication.

<H3><B>Gehe makes 650m bid for Lloyds</B></H3>
<P>

Gehe this week re-entered the fray for Lloyds Chemists, with a cash offer of 650.6 million, comprising 500p for each Lloyds' ordinary share and 322.6p for each preference share. The offer matches Gehe's final offer in February, although it has claimed that Lloyds' value has fallen since then. The German company says the offer provides Lloyds' shareholders with ''certainty of value'', a reference to Unichem's cash and share offer which, Gehe says, is vulnerable to the performance of its shares. Unichem's offer, when it was announced a few weeks ago, valued Lloyds at 657.6m. At the time C&D went to press, the British company's offer was worth 500.6p a share, or 651.3m. 
<P>
Jeff Harris, Unichem's chief executive, has reportedly not ruled out pitching a higher offer. Gehe claims its recent divestments - it sold Azupharma, its generic pharmaceutical manufacturer, to Sandoz for about 500m - has made it financially strong. That means it would not be under pressure to realise short-term synergies from the acquisition. 
<P>
But Unichem, says Gehe, would face that pressure if its bid succeeds, as it aims to increase its earnings substantially in 1998. As a result, it may fail to maximise its ultimate benefits.
<P>
Gehe's gearing, if its bid was successful, would be about 100 per cent. It claims Unichem's pro forma gearing would be 362 per cent (based on its financial position on June 30). Dieter K&auml;mmerer, Gehe's chairman, has urged Lloyds' shareholders to back his bid. ''I believe our renewed offer of 500p per share in cash is notably generous given the deterioration in Lloyds Chemists' performance in the last financial year. Our offer reflects, however, our evaluation of the strategic benefits and synergies arising from an acquisition of Lloyds.''
<P>
While press speculation has suggested that Gehe and Unichem would divest some of Lloyds' non-pharmaceutical interests, the German wholesaler says it will review the viability of these businesses if its bid succeeds. As <EM>C&D </EM> went to press, Unichem was locked in negotiations with its financial advisers over its next move. Lloyds refuses to comment until both bidders have announced their final offers.

<H3><B>Wellcome products in agency scheme</B></H3>
<P>

Glaxo Wellcome is integrating Wellcome products into its agency scheme following a review of its operation. Wellcome's zero discounted products are not included in the scheme. Ten per cent of the company's products are ZD, whereas only 1 per cent of GW's portfolio is not discounted.
<P>
In a letter sent out to pharmacists last week, GW said: ''To minimise any disruption to our customers, the current discount thresholds, which have been in place since October 1, 1995, will remain unchanged. This will increase the amount of discount Glaxo Wellcome will be paying at your top marginal rate. In addition, we have been in discussion with our agents to ensure that, where possible, their thresholds on non-Glaxo Wellcome products will be adjusted to fully reflect the integration.''
<P>
GW says pharmacists should enjoy greater discounts through the scheme because they will be buying 10 per cent more through it than before. Annual sales of Wellcome products now included in the agency scheme are estimated at 30 million. Glaxo's share of the ethical market has fallen from 15 per cent before the scheme was introduced about four years ago to 13.5 per cent. The addition of Wellcome products boosts the company's share back to about 15 per cent.
<P>
The British Association of Pharmaceutical Wholesalers says the integration of Wellcome products was a GW initiative and did not involve the BAPW or the joint working party. ''The discounts that pharmacists will now receive on Glaxo Wellcome products are a matter between them and Glaxo Wellcome,'' it says.
<P>
The BAPW says progress has been made on a number of issues, including an agreement on fees for ZD products and on changing the way the management fee is calculated. The working party, it adds, will continue to try to improve the agency scheme.

<P>Meanwhile, GW has told wholesalers they can fit in their stock reconciliation to suit their needs. Under GW's previous system, the wholesalers had to undertake their stock reconciliation every month. 
<P>
Last week, GW began a pilot of weekly deliveries to wholesalers and says it will be liaising with them to monitor the pilot's progress. Unichem says pharmacists have not commented about the changes. Dr Phil Thomas, Unichem's general manager, has been liaising with GW over the scheme. ''Unichem has been working with Glaxo to make the changes as seamless as possible and, judging by the reaction so far [from pharmacists], the integration has been seamless.''

<H3><B>Newmark management courses</B></H3>
<P>

Numark has linked up with Smithkline Beecham and Latham, Crossley & Davies, a chartered accountancy firm, to offer management training programmes for pharmacists. The programmes are part of a series of new projects that Numark announced at last weekend's shareholder day held in Birmingham.
<P>
SB is said to have invested tens of thousands of pounds in the Numark/Smithkline Beecham Consumer Healthcare management training programme, whose details are expected to be finalised by the end of the month. The scheme, due to begin next year, will be run by a specialist agency appointed by Numark.
<P>
Pharmacists will be charged 800-2,000, depending on their requirements, although Numark says the Government will probably subsidise the higher fee. Terry Norris, Numark's managing director, says that if the Government refuses, it will still go ahead with the scheme. 
<P>
Pharmacists can opt to do the course at John Moores University School of Pharmacy, where they will receive a postgraduate certificate, or they can do a correspondence/residential course to earn a National Vocational Qualification in management, level 4/5. The Numark/Latham, Crossley & Davies strategy day programme is designed to tie-in with the postgraduate course. Its first stage is a strategy day, priced at 295, where pharmacists will devise a business plan with LCD's partners. 
<P>
Those who want to go further will pay 3,500-6,500 for a programme that is tailored to suit their individual needs. While Numark does not have any targets for the schemes, Mr Norris says he will be delighted if they can sign on at least 150 pharmacists by the end of the year. 
<P>
He says that they should not be deterred by the programmes' prices. ''These are worthwhile investments, like your fixtures and fittings, and stock. They should be measured against the returns that you get from investments in your business,'' he says. He stresses that Numark and its programme organisers do not intend to make profits from the schemes. 
<P>
Meanwhile, Numark will be offering its members 40-50 products whose prices match those of High Street multiples. Its current list includes baby care items, such as Pampers, and feminine hygiene brands. 
<P>
David Wood, Numark's marketing director, says the low-priced products are fundamental pharmacy items and are designed to raise the profile of independent pharmacies. They will also persuade consumers, he adds, that pharmacies can offer competitively-priced goods.
<P>
On the NHS front, Numark has set up a joint 'branded ethical equalisation programme', which allows its members to dispense the brand against open scripts, such as Numark Tenormin against atenolol. Numark will appoint an NHS business manager soon to develop this area.
<P>
Members have also been offered a choice of four store formats: healthcare, health and beauty, essential and neighbourhood. Numark says the formats will help it to establish group identity nationwide. Numark has 950 members and has a target of 965 for the end of the year.

<H3><B>Pharmacist's lesson in economics</B></H3>
<P>

A pharmacist has won first prize in a competition organised by the  Adam Smith Institute. David Mills, a relief pharmacist for Boots from Broughty Ferry, Tayside, was presented with a prize of 1,500 for writing about ways in which the NHS prescription process could be changed. 
<P>
The Institute's annual 'Economy in Government' competition invites members of the public to put forward ideas on how it can function more efficiently. Mr Mills submitted a 1,500 word precis and then a business plan for the final. The basis of his four-part proposal was to:
<li>make the 5.50 prescription fee a maximum and allow the pharmacist to treat NHS prescriptions as private if the product can be sold more cheaply than the 5.50;
<li>increase generic prescribing, potentially saving 350 million;
<li>introduce a triple-copy prescription, which could be redeemed in one go or on a 30-, 60- or 90-day basis, to reduce the amount of unused medicine;
<li>have a nominal charge, eg 0.40, for all prescriptions.
<P>
He received advice on figures from the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee and Boots. In all, he estimated that annual savings of 500m could be made. This had to stand up to the scrutiny of the judges, including members of the Adam Smith Institute and representatives from Ernst &amp;  Young, one of the co-sponsors.
<P>
As to why he won, he thinks the judges were impressed that it was a community pharmacist working ''at the coal-face'' who made the submission.

The Pharmaceutical Society in Northern Ireland is developing a strategy for the future, on the same lines as the 'Pharmacy in a New Age' initiative in Great Britain. The PSNI Council has agreed in principle to the proposal and over the next couple of months will be setting some basic objectives to put to pharmacists in the province in a consultation exercise planned for the spring.
<P>
The PSNI hopes that the strategy that emerges will provide the profession with a focus until at least 2020. The Society is keen to emphasise that it is writing its own agenda, and may not reach the same conclusions as the PIANA initiative launched by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society

Health secretary Stephen Dorrell says that there will be another White Paper on primary care. A Department of Health official says it is expected this month. ''The various consultation processes this year have highlighted a number of areas. Some have been dealt with in the current legislation. Others will be dealt with in this White Paper.''
<P>
The Paper is expected to set out proposals for greater co-operation between health professionals which do not require legislation, including better use of IT. 
<P>
 This latest White Paper follows one in October allowing health authorities more flexibility in purchasing primary care services. A second White Paper, outlining the future of the NHS, was published last month.

Last week, journalist colleagues - many of whom had worked with him at C&D - wished him well at a private dinner at the Royal Pharmaceutical Society. 
<P>
Ron joined the magazine in 1962 as a trainee journalist, and became a familiar figure at pharmacy gatherings up and down the country in the years that followed. In January, 1970, he was appointed deputy editor. In 1982, he was promoted to editor/publisher, and publisher in 1984. To mark his retirement he was presented with three antique drug jars (salmon pink, of course) and a case of port.

<H3><B>Primary care fraud highlighted</B></H3>
<P>

Fraud in the NHS primary care sector has been highlighted in the latest Audit Commission survey published this week. Primary care services accounted for 1 million of detected fraud in 1995-96, four times that in the year before. However, this includes fraud committed by patients.
<P>
 The report comes the week after the Department of Health announced it was to commence an efficiency scrutiny on prescription fraud. The survey says the amount of detected fraud in the NHS doubled in 1995-96 to 1.4m (compared to 0.75m in 1994-95). However, the number of detected cases fell to 279 in 1995-96, compared to 350 the previous year.
<P>
The Commission believes that, although the level of detected fraud increased, it still remains the tip of the iceberg. Only 29 cases account for the 1m of fraud in primary care.

Rural pharmacies may soon be able to benefit from a discretionary rate relief scheme, according to the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee. Pharmacies in villages with a population of 3,000 or less could qualify for the scheme, under which they could be exempt from up to 100 per cent of their annual rates bill.
<P>
The Local Government and Rating Bill proposes the introduction of a rate relief scheme for a range of rural businesses. PSNC will issue guidance to local pharmaceutical committees once the Bill has been approved by parliament.

<H3><B>Vulnerable groups use pharmacy most</B></H3>
<P>
The more vulnerable patients are the ones who are likely to benefit from pharmacy the most, reveals a survey that was commissioned by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society. Face to face surveys of 500 people found mothers of children under five, people living in inner city areas and the elderly were more frequent visitors, with 15, 14 and 13 visits per year, respectively, compared with an average of 12 for the rest of the population. A related study of 1,000 people found that 94 per cent visited a pharmacy at least once in the last year.
<P>
Society president Ian Caldwell says the findings confirm that pharmacies are now the most regularly used point of contact between the public and healthcare. ''For many people struggling to cope with a tough existence pharmacies are quite simply a health lifeline,'' he adds.
<P>
Pharmacy loyalty is clearly demonstrated in the study, with 60 per cent sticking with the one pharmacy for each of the service elements. The greatest loyalty exists for prescription dispensing, with 80 per cent of those requiring repeat prescriptions opting for service from the same pharmacy.
<P>
Convenience was cited as the most common reason for choosing a pharmacy, with suburban/town or local pharmacies used by 80 per cent of respondents. Less than one in ten used pharmacies in city centres, out of town centres, health centres and supermarkets. Prescriptions topped the league of why people visited a pharmacy, with repeat prescriptions presented once every six weeks, while 'one-off' prescriptions occurred three times a year.
<P>
Some 80 per cent also visit pharmacies with the intention of buying health-related products without actively seeking advice. Specific advice on symptoms was requested by 34 per cent, this service was most used by women and those aged 25-59, while elderly patients are low users. 
<P>
General health advice was requested by 11 per cent, although, again, women were the greatest users. Those who use the service make an average of six consultations per year. The Society is to build on the BMRB International survey to investigate what contribution to healthcare is made by pharmacies in deprived areas and how pharmaceutical services can be developed.

<H3><B>OFT flags up RPM change in paper</B></H3>
<P>
The Office of Fair Trading has pinpointed changes relating to the sale of price maintained medicines, but stresses it has not come to any firm conclusions on whether to push for an end to Resale Price Maintenance.In an RPM review consultation paper issued last week, the OFT outlines the areas of possible change in the relevant circumstances since RPM was last investigated in 1970 as:
<P>
<UL>

<LI>prescriptions account for 60-75 per cent of pharmacy sales now, compared with 40-50 per cent in 1970
<LI><P>
<LI> in 1970, 10-13 per cent of the proportion of pharmacy turn-over was due to proprietary medicines. The OFT now finds that this is 6-13 per cent with another 3-5 per cent for GSL and non-licensed products
<LI><P>
<LI> the court in 1970 argued that consumers visit pharmacies more to buy proprietary medicines than for prescriptions. OFT research reveals that now only 16 per cent visit pharmacies for OTCs, while 62 per cent go for a prescription. This suggests, says the report, ''that the importance of sales of proprietaries has declined since 1970''
<LI><P>
<LI> the 1970 judgment said consumers would shop at supermarkets if prices fell. In an OFT survey, 60 per cent of consumers said they would still go to a pharmacy even if supermarket prices were 10 per cent less. However, more than a third said their visits to the pharmacy would be reduced
<LI><P>
<LI> in 1970, the court found that many pharmacies were only marginally profitable, but the OFT says the subsequent growth of pharmacy chains ''casts doubt on this conclusion''. It adds that changes in NHS remuneration ''may mean that RPM is now less important in determining chemist numbers than the nature of remuneration by the Department of Health''.
</UL>

<P>
The Community Pharmacy Action Group says it welcomes the OFT's open mind. Tim Astill, CPAG member and director of the National Pharmaceutical Association, says: ''The OFT's investigations have not revealed any evidence to affect the validity of the judgment in 1970 that RPM on medicines is in the public interest. Indeed, much of the evidence points to reduced profitability of pharmacies and a greater threat to the community pharmacy network.''
<P>
Supermarket chain Asda, which has spearheaded the attack on RPM, says it is ''optimistic that the OFT will announce its intention to review RPM''.
<P>
The OFT will now consult with interested parties before deciding whether to refer the issue to the Restrictive Practices Court. Consultees must respond by August 23.
<P>
<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI><STRONG> The Independent Television Commission</STRONG> has upheld a complaint about Asda's television advertisements for its own-label brand, which featured ex-newsreader Jan Leeming.Asda, defending its action against the Royal Pharmaceutical Society's complaint, said Ms Leeming had not been on national television for five years and could no longer be regarded as a 'personality'.
<LI><STRONG>Archy Kirwood</STRONG>, Liberal Democrat chief whip and former pharmacist, has written to trade president Ian Lang urging him to do all in his power to keep RPM.

<H3><B>McLeish loses pharmacy portfolio to Jowell</B></H3>
<P>
The Labour Party's health team has been radically restructured in a shadow ministerial reshuffle by Tony Blair. Harriet Harman has been moved to the social security brief. She is replaced in a straight job swap by Chris Smith. Henry McLeish, the number two health spokesman charged with drawing up party policy on pharmacy issues, has also been moved to speak on social security. 
<P>
Mr McLeish, who has appeared at a number of pharmaceutical events in recent months, was a keen supporter of Resale Price Maintenance. His job will be taken by Tessa Jowell, who previously handled women's issues.

<H3><B>Script costs rise by 8pc over two years</B></H3>
<P>
Script costs rise by 8pc over two years The basic cost of prescription items has risen by over 8 per cent since 1994. According to the Department of Health's 1995 prescription statistical bulletin, the cost of prescriptions dispensed in 1995 was 3,681 million, an increase of 8.1 per cent or 5.6 per cent in real terms since 1994. 
<P>
The rise is despite over half of prescriptions now being written generically. An average of 9.7 items were dispensed per head of population, a rise of 0.3 per cent on the previous year. The majority of prescriptions, 84 per cent, were exempt. 
<P>
The 'Prescriptions Dispensed in the Family Health Services Authorities: England 1985-1995' is available from the DoH, PO Box 410, Wetherby LS23 7LM, at a cost of 2.

<H3><B>Numark harnesses Norchem's power</B></H3>
<P>
Numark has appointed ethical product distributor Norchem as its distributor for the north east of England. Norchem specialises in distributing ethical pharmaceuticals in Tyne & Wear, County Durham, Cleveland and part of north Yorkshire. It will work with Unichem, Numark's current distributor in the North East.
<P>
Most of Norchem's customers are also the shareholders and all its directors are pharmacists. Numark is seeking to persuade the distributor's 72 shareholders to become shareholders in its group. Through the deal, Numark has increased to 12 the number of wholesalers it works with.  
<P>
Gordon Herdman, Norchem's chairman, says the arrangement is ideal. ''Numark is a good group for us to work with - it gives more strength to our members' individual businesses because they will be part of a progressive organisation.''  Buying groups represent survival for independent pharmacists, he adds. ''I feel that today, the independent retail pharmacist is going to have his hands very, very full to survive if he's not part of a professionally-based marketing group.''
<P>
John Irish, Numark's chairman, says it has been strengthened by the Norchem deal. ''It's all about numbers because numbers breed power and numbers breed safety.'' His company has 915 shareholder pharmacists, with a target of 1,000 by year end. It is looking to appoint a recruiter to expand this membership. The person will be based at the company's headquarters in Tamworth, Staffordshire.
<P>
Terry Norris, Numark's managing director, admits that the group occasionally loses members, mostly when pharmacies close down, but says it is working hard to achieve a balance of shareholders around the UK. David Wood, the company's marketing director, says it recruits two shareholders for every one it loses. It will also benefit if Lloyds is acquired. ''We've had people who say they would consider going to Numark, if Lloyds is taken over by Unichem or Gehe,'' he says.
<P>
Following a 'brainstorm' meeting of Numark's directors held on July 3, the group has introduced a number of strategic initiatives. These include the appointment of Mike Johnson as retail services manager. Mr Johnson was formerly Lloyds' merchandising manager.
<P>
Numark has also created the  new post of NHS business manager to strengthen its NHS work. The manager, yet to be recruited, will be responsible for negotiating with ethical product manufacturers, developing the group's generics programme and its own-label medicines. NHS work accounts for 70 per cent of its business. 
<P>
Alexandra Nolan has been recruited as the group's own-brand manager. Ms Nolan was formerly at the Jessops Group. Numark also decided at the meeting to reposition its vitamins, minerals and supplements ranges to counter the competition pharmacists face from health shops and grocers. Changes include new products, packaging, point of sale material and better margins, according to the company.
<P>
It has been involved in an EPoS project to study what are pharmacists' best-selling lines. It is poring over its data and intends to show it to independent pharmacists. It says pharmacists are stocking too many  lines and is offering them a planogram to help. Numark is discussing its initiatives with its shareholders and will hold a national meeting in Birmingham on Sunday, November 3, to announce the results of these discussions. 
<P>
Mr Irish says independent pharmacies are improving their retailing skills, but not as much as the group would like. It, in turn, is also improving gradually. ''These things might not look very much at the moment, but we're beginning to gather speed. We might have moved up only from first to second gear, but at least we've moved up a gear,'' he says. 
<P>
Meanwhile, Numark's shareholders received an average rebate of 158 per pharmacy (191 including interest) for the first quarter this year. This is a return of 132 per cent (160 per cent including interest) on the first quarter's management fee, according to Numark. During the quarter, the group's total rebate on membership amounted to 142,262 (172,316 including share capital interest), up 637 per cent on the rebate of the first quarter last year.

<H3><B>Israeli company Teva targets UK generics market</B></H3>
<P>
Foreign generic brands are likely to be introduced into the UK following Teva Pharmaceutical Industries' acquisition of the Leeds-based Approved Prescription Services. Teva has worldwide interests in generics. It is described as Israel's leading supplier of human pharmaceuticals, pharmaceutical chemicals, bulk pharmaceuticals and medical disposables. Its US subsidiaries' combined sales together make them the second biggest force in the US generics market. 
<P>
Over 60 per cent of Teva's sales are generated outside Israel. The company acquired APS from Rhone-Poulenc Rorer for 34 million in cash and formally completed the acquisition last week. APS has 20 per cent of the UK generics market, making it the second largest company in the sector. Almost half of its sales are produced from its 90,000sq ft plant, and the balance is purchased from third parties. 
<P>
It is too early to say what brands Teva will bring into the UK, but the move is part of its overall strategy to develop APS. Andrew Kay, APS's general manager, confirms he is looking to expand its portfolio. ''We'll benefit from being part of a global company that focuses on generics. We're very optimistic about the future,'' he says.
<P>
Teva will also use APS as a springboard for other lucrative European generic markets. The Israeli company has manufacturing facilities in Israel, Europe and the US. APS had an operating loss of 460,000 on sales of 42m for the year to December 31, 1995. But it now appears to be on the right track, due to considerably higher margins. During the first half of this year, its operating income topped 1m on sales of about 22m. 
<P>
Eli Hurvitz, president and chief executive of Teva, comments: ''We are excited about the prospects of the potential synergies between APS and Teva. This acquisition represents yet another step in Teva's penetration into the global and specifically European generic markets.''

<H3><B>Lloyds makes approach to potential buyers</B></H3>
<P>

Lloyds Chemists has made approaches to potential buyers for its wholesale depots, even though it is Unichem and Gehe which are being forced to sell them by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission before they are allowed to renew their bidding war. Press reports have suggested that Lloyds is planning to sell the depots itself, but the company's finance director, Jonathan Fellows, insists it is merely ''doing some of the spadework'' for the two would-be bidders. 
<P>
A few weeks ago, the secretary of state for trade and industry ruled that Unichem would be eligible to re-bid for Lloyds if it found a buyer or list of buyers for Lloyds' wholesale depots at Cambridge, Carlisle, Coulsdon, Derby, Glasgow and York. Gehe was given the same conditions, except it has to sell a further depot in Belfast.
<P>
Mr Fellows says other parties had expressed interest in the depots during the bid battle for Lloyds earlier this year. ''We're talking to these people and asking them if they're still interested and, if we go forward [with the depot sale process], who we should talk to,'' says Mr Fellows. He says that Lloyds has the depots' interests at heart. ''We know the depots well and we want them to continue as going concerns. We have been talking to the sort of people whose business, we believe, complements that of the depots,'' explains Mr Fellows.
<P>
Unichem and Gehe need some information about the depots if they want to find potential buyers, but Lloyds says there is a limit to how much information it can give them.
<P>
''We've got the information, but we have to be careful about how we communicate that to the two parties because, if the  bids do not proceed, the two parties could still have commercially-sensitive information,'' says Mr Fellows. ''There is not a great deal of information we can give them until they agree about the process of selling the depots,'' he adds. 
<P>
Unichem and Gehe were this week discussing the finer points of the depots' sales with the Department of Trade and Industry.

<P>

POM to P and P to POM switches, which were expected on December 31, have been delayed as they have been incorporated into a new consolidation Order, planned to take effect next April.
<P>
The changes included topical hydrocortisone 1 per cent becoming a P medicine when used in combination with clotrimazole for athlete's foot and candidal intertrigo. 
<P>
Mebeverine hydrochloride in a maximum dose of 135mg and maximum daily dose of 405mg was to become classified as P for the symptomatic relief of irritable bowel syndrome. Amyl nitrite would become POM except for use as an antidote in cyanide poisoning. The herb aristolochia would also become POM.
<P>
Details of other POM to P proposals appear in the January 4 issue of Chemist &amp; Druggist.

<P>

The Prescription Pricing Authority is to pay contractors their monthly reimbursement and remuneration costs directly, instead of via the health authority, from April 1.Until now, the PPA produced the payment schedules for the HAs, which paid the contractor taking into account local agreements. 
<P>
The move, which follows a ministerial decision, applies to pharmacy, appliance and supply of oxygen contractors. Health authorities will continue to pay for locally agreed elements until and including June. The PPA will then take this over as well from July 1

<P>

Pharmacy window displays can play a significant role in health promotion, a study in 20 pharmacies by Ealing, Hammersmith & Hounslow Health Authority has found. 
<P>
Uptake of health information leaflets increased 43 times during and after a window campaign. Customer enquiries about the subject, emergency contraception, were also up by two to four times.
<P>
A customer survey at the same time found 80 per cent of people would go to a pharmacist for advice about emergency contraception if they knew the pharmacist was trained to give advice.

A professional standard for sales representatives from OTC medicines manufacturers is to be implemented by 1998. The scheme, announced at the Proprietary Association of Great Britain's annual strategy meeting in December, means sales representatives will undergo training, possibly by distance learning, and then take an exam set by an external body.
<P>
PAGB says that the 'ultimate objective is to raise the standards of representation across the industry and to improve the image and standing of the OTC rep with health professionals, and, in particular, community pharmacists'

<P>

Norton Healthcare has resigned from the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry in a row over a trade promotion involving mountain bikes or Marks &amp; Spencer gift vouchers for pharmacists who bought certain prescription medicines.
<P>
The ABPI decided that the advertisement breached the Prescription Code of Practice because it was offering 'unacceptable inducements'. 
<P>
Norton argued that the clause did not apply to promotions and trade practices that existed before January 1, 1993, and that this was an offer first promoted before that date..

<H1 align=center><B> assistant training</B></H1>
<P>
<IMG SRC="gifs/count1.gif" ALT="Counterpart page 1" HSPACE=15 VSPACE=15 ALIGN=right>
<P>It's time for existing course users to prepare for certification; new users must register now for their progress to be officially monitored.
<P>
Accreditation of the Cambridge Counterpart Pharmacy Assistant Development Programme means that pharmacists wishing to use the Programme must register their medicines counter assistants with C&amp;D now in order to qualify for a College of Pharmacy Practice certificate.
<P>
College requirements also stipulate that independent verification of marking is carried out by the course providers - with C&amp;D's innovative telephone marking system offering the ideal solution. Hundreds of assistants have been using this service successfully since the programme began in July 1995, and it is the option recommended by C&amp;D to new course participants.
<P>
<B>The key decision points for community pharmacists are:</B>
<P>
1. <I>For assistants already following Counterpart and registered
for telephone marking</I>.

<P>
Continue with the course (including the progress module - see below). Once it is completed you will receive the results and documentation for CPP certification. (See Section A below).
<P>
2. <I>For assistants following Counterpart but not registered for telephone marking</I>.
<P>
Use the form in the August 24 (page 259) issue to register now. When  your assistants receive their PINs, they should enter their multiple choice questionnaire responses up to date, then follow the course to the end. CPP certification will be available as above. (See Section B below).
<P>
3. <I>For assistants not yet following Counterpart</I>.
<P>
Use the form in the August 24 (page 259) to register now.  If you have retained the free modules sponsored by Whitehall Laboratories, start your assistants on.

<IMG SRC="gifs/count3.gif" ALT="Counterpart page 3" HSPACE=15 VSPACE=15 ALIGN=right>
the course at once and mark the questionnaires as soon as PINs are received. If you do not still have the free modules available, use the order form to obtain complete packs of modules issued to date, plus questionnaires and Pharmacist Briefings. (See Section C below).
<P>
<B>Fees</B>
<P>
The Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain has levied a fee of &#163;5 per assistant certificated by the College of Pharmacy Practice. This fee must be collected by the course provider and paid to the College when submitting verification that the candidate has completed the course and achieved the required standard. The College will then issue its own certificate to the assistant.
<P>
<B>Progress module</B>
<P>
An additional requirement set by the College of Pharmacy Practice is that candidates' progress should be monitored externally by the course provider. This is accomplished by C&amp;D's
telephone marking system.
<P>
<A HREF="#top">Top of page</A>
<HR>
<A NAME="b"></A>
<H1 align=center>Cambridge Counterpart</H1>
<P>
<H2 align=center>C&amp;D's cost-effective training solution</H2>
<P>
Cambridge Counterpart Pharmacy Assistant Development Programme is Chemist &amp; Druggist's cost-effective solution to the Royal Pharmaceutical Society's requirement that by July 1, 1996, medicines
counter assistants must have been undertaking, or have already completed, an approved course of training. 
<P>
Experienced assistants also have the option to take a multiple choice question paper (MCQ) set by the Society - ideally after using Counterpart as part of their revision process. The next opportunity finally for examination is on November 14 (see C&amp;D August 31, p277 for details).
<P>
Thanks to the generous sponsorship of Whitehall Laboratories, all C&amp;D community pharmacy subscribers have received free monthly topic-based training modules between July 1995 and June 1996. Each unit in the 17-module distance-learning programme is for use by up to four assistants and comes complete with four individualquestion papers, plus a case study for discussion with the supervising pharmacist. 
<P>
A &quot;Pharmacist's Briefing&quot; provides professional guidance on serious disease and other implications arising from the training process - picking up particularly from the point where assistants are instructed to &quot;Refer to the pharmacist&quot;. <P>
Assistants' progress is monitored in the pharmacy using the &quot;Development Log&quot;, but independent monitoring and marking by the course provider are required for achievement to be recognised for certification by the College of Pharmacy Practice.
<P>
<A HREF="#top">Top of page</A>
<HR>
<A NAME="c"></A>
<H1 align=center>How to get assistant certification through Counterpart</H1>
<P>
<B>A. For assistants registered for telephone marking (PIN users)</B>
<P>
If your assistants are subscribing to Chemist &amp; Druggist's interactive telephone marking system they will automatically be registered with Chemist &amp; Druggist as a course provider.
<P>
When your assistant successfully completes the Counterpart course we will send you a completion certificate, and a letter to sign and return to Chemist &amp; Druggist. The letter requires you to acknowledge that you have monitored, and that your assistant has attained, satisfactory communication skills, and that together you have worked through each set of case studies. 
<P>
<I>Charges</I>
<P>
There is a charge of &#163;2.50 (plus &#163;0.44 VAT) to cover processing of an assistant's certification through the College of Pharmacy Practice. There will be an additional &#163;5 charge levied by the Royal
Pharmaceutical Society for each assistant certificated by the CPP. These monies will be requested on course completion.
<P>
<B>B. For assistants following Counterpart but not yet registered (non-PIN users)</B> 
<P>
If your assistants have been using Counterpart and retaining  the elements of each Pharmacy Assistant Development Module as it has been completed, you will need to register with Chemist &amp; Druggist as a course user. The College of Pharmacy Practice requires C&amp;D to verify your assistants' learning achievement.
<P>
We suggest our interactive telephone marking system (PIN) will allow your assistants to do this most easily.
<P>
On payment of the requisite fee C&amp;D will issue your assistants with a PIN and they will automatically beome registered as course users. They should then log their MCQ results attained to date.
<P>
<I>Charges</I>
<P>
Registration fee (to cover issue of PIN for telephone marking)
&#163;12.50, administration charge for CPP certification &#163;2.50, RPSGB levy &#163;5 Total  &#163;20.00 plus &#163;3.50 VAT.
<P>
<B>Manual users</B>
<P>
If your assistants do not have access to a touch-tone telephone, or you wish to continue with the manual marking system, please write to John Skelton, Associate Publisher, Pharmacy Group Special Projects, Chemist &amp; Druggist, Miller Freeman Professional, Miller Freeman House, Sovereign Way, Tonbridge, Kent TN9 1RW. Special arrangements will be made to cope with your requirements.
<P>
<I>Charges</I>
<P>
The all-inclusive fee for using the manual assessment method is
&#163;25 (plus  &#163;4.38 VAT) for registration, marking and
CPP certification.
<P>
<B>C. For assistants not yet using Counterpart</B>
<P>
If you have kept each complete Counterpart module to date (Pharmacist Briefing and Pharmacy Assistant Development Module), you may register your assistants on the course as in section B above. 
<P>
For subscribers who have not kept Counterpart, C&amp;D will provide complete sets of back issues are available.
<P>
<I>Charges</I>
<P>

<CENTER><STRONG>Four figures - 2000 - could spell disaster for businesses with computers as the new<br> millennium approaches.
 Ian Hugo explains</STRONG></CENTER>
<p>

Ever heard of the millennium bug? An epidemic of cases is predicted and widespread panic is possible later this year or early next. So you need to know about it and how to treat it now.
<p>
The bug refers to date representations in computer programmes that will cause them to fail as the new millennium approaches, or after midnight on December 31, 1999.
<p>
Dates in computer programmes rarely take account of the century. That is because of the logic generally applied to them. For example, September 1 this year is represented as 960901. This is treated in calculations involving dates as a number, since numbers are what computers process most easily, and date logic assumes that the value of this number always increases as time passes. This will be true until 991231 (December 31, 1999). On the next day, the date will be 000101 and you don't need to be a mathematical genius to see that that number has a lower value than 991231.
<p>
That's another fine mess the computer industry has got business into, you might sigh; but what has it got to do with you?
<p>
Quite a lot, actually. For instance, it could corrupt date labelling of drug inventories, threaten supplies, cause you to dump supplies that are current, lose records of drugs dispensed, make your accounts system crash and knock out prescription payment systems.
<p>
Stock produced on, say, January 4, 1998, with a shelf life of two years, will show the production date as 980104 and the expiry date as 000103. Shelf life is checked by subtracting the current date value from expiry date value and ensuring that the result is positive. In this case, it won't be and the stock will be rejected.
<p>
Aged debtors analysis is performed by subtracting the invoice date value from the current date value and listing all invoices that produce a (positive) result over a predetermined threshold (for example, 90 days). In the new millennium, the result will become negative and relevant invoices will not be listed.
<p>
Your prescription records will also be affected. You normally find out how current they are by comparing the dates of back-ups. The date with the highest value is regarded as current and the back-up with the lowest date value is usually discarded. In the new millennium, current data will therefore be overwritten by historical data.
<p>
As the pharmaceutical industry is linked intimately to the nation's health, such problems could prove potentially business-threatening and life-threatening. Where serious failures occur, it is widely expected that both individuals and companies will resort to legal action for negligence and the damages caused.  The legal profession is looking forward to a field day.
<p>
You could avoid the bug by following these steps: 
<br>
<li>Create an inventory of all the software you use. Any you have written in-house, or any package that you have modified, you will have to fix yourself or replace. 
<li>Contact the suppliers of packages you have bought to check: when a year 2000 compliant release will be available, what it will cost and what other software (operating systems, database systems, etc) it depends on; compliant releases of these will be needed, too.
<li>If you want more advice, the Government recently set up a task force to send out information about the problem and to co-ordinate efforts to deal with it. The Computer Software and Services Association (CSSA, telephone: 0171 405 2171) is acting as a contact point, while an office for the task force is being set up.
<p>
You could also try to attend one of the numerous seminars, many of them free of charge, that are being organised by professional bodies, computer vendors and others, for the latter part of this year. A major conference for senior executives, backed by the task force, will take place next month in London.
<p>
Guidance on questions you should put to software suppliers will shortly be available from the CSSA. On no account attempt to test any package for compliance yourself without first contacting the supplier. Some packages fail in bizarre ways and they may crash and not allow you to reload them, causing you to lose the application.
<p>
Your legal and audit advisers (internal and external) should be able to tell you more about the business implications of the problem. If you are a significant part of any supply chain, you may find other members of the chain demanding guarantees/
warranties from you with respect to continuity of service as the new millennium approaches. You should be asking the same of them.
<p>
Where you interface electronically with any external organisation, via file transfers or transaction clearing mechanisms, the resolution of the problem that you adopt needs to be 'homogenised' with theirs. 
<p>
You should enquire particularly about plans in any public sector bodies to which you interface; there is a serious problem of budget allocation in the public sector and fixes may be very late.
<p>
If you are part of a large organisation, the chances are that head office is already tackling the problem and has enlisted expert help. Large organisations are generally facing project costs of several million pounds. However, it won't hurt to enquire what their plans are and how they will affect you.
<p>
Resolving the problem in all industries worldwide could cost up to $600 billion, though some estimates are only half that. The estimate for UK plc is around 20-30bn.
<p>
But don't panic yet. Just act now. However you go into the new millennium, you don't want to do so with your business blighted by a treatable bug.

<CENTER><H1>A new Age tempered by RPM</H1></CENTER>
<p>

Ian Caldwell, president of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, is confident that the profession will respond to the 'Pharmacy in a New Age' initiative and take pharmacy positively towards and beyond the next millennium.
<p>
"Colleagues at Lambeth, York Place and Cardiff intend to provide the leadership and a framework for success that will mean a complete review of the way in which the Council and the Executives operate, and may mean the implementation of new procedures," he said.
<p>
Some 400 delegates were present as the president outlined key areas of the 'New Age' initiative, the fight for Resale Price Maintenance and the Society's role in remuneration.
<p>
He explained that the 'New Age' initiative concentrated on community pharmacy. This was not surprising, he reasoned, as ministers of health have said that it is in the community pharmacy sector that the full potential of the education and training of the pharmacist has yet to be realised. But he warned, "Any attempt to abandon our community pharmacy base will be done at our peril."
<p>
The Society "made it clear that standing still was never an option". No fewer than 5,000 pharmacists have taken part in the consultation initiative, he said. "The overwhelming thrust of their comments was that the traditional pharmacy must change and be developed as a centre for health, while remaining in the locations which ensure convenient access to the vast majority of the public."
<p>
PIANA has highlighted the need for strong leadership. "What the Society and other bodies in the profession can reasonably be expected to do is create the structure, the environment that will make professional advances possible. But to achieve that progress there must be a real and sustained commitment from the profession."
<p>
Although the Society should not become involved in negotiations for remuneration, one of the objects of its Charter is 'to safeguard and promote the interests of the members in their exercise of the profession of pharmacy'.
<p>
"This means that the Society has a vital interest in the overall shape of remuneration. One of the outcomes of the PIANA initiative will, therefore, be discussions with other bodies about the shape of the remuneration structure. We believe that a structure that is based on volume cannot achieve the desired objective, which is to ensure that the full potential of the professional role of community pharmacists is achieved.
<p>
"This might mean the dispensing of fewer prescriptions," he suggested. "What it should certainly not ever mean is a reduction in remuneration when patient care is improved and economy is achieved by the application of professional expertise."
<p><br>


<STRONG>Importance of RPM</STRONG>
<p>
The president then turned to Resale Price Maintenance. Describing the subject as "of equally vital importance to pharmacy", Mr Caldwell believes that the director general of Fair Trading "will have found that the position is much more intricate than it would first appear".
<p>
One of the tasks of the DGFT is to demonstrate that there have been material changes in retailing since 1970. "It would be ridiculous to argue that there have been no changes in circumstances in 25 years. Remember during that time there has been a virtual revolution in retailing in this country," he said.
<p>
"What the director general has to prove, however, is that there have been changes affecting an essential part of the reasoning by which the court reached its previous decision." In the OFT's consultation paper, "it was made clear that the DGFT had not reached a conclusion".
<p>
The Office of Fair Trading has identified eight areas of change. The Community Pharmacists' Action Group "has concluded that nearly all of the changes identified by the OFT strengthen substantially, rather than weak-en, the case for the continuation of RPM in the public interest", said Mr Caldwell.
<p>
However, there was one positive result of re-opening the case for RPM, he suggested. "It enabled the Society to marshall the forces of the British Medical Association and the Royal College of Nursing in the issue of a joint statement." 
<p>
This was to the effect that "whatever the outcome of the RPM debate, the public interest demanded that medicines must be treated specially, should not be promoted on price and should not be subject to marketing ploys which would encourage the public to treat them as ordinary articles of commerce".
<p>
Mr Caldwell said that he had recently written to the health secretary about the need for a public health policy on the way in which medicines should be presented to the public. "Decisions on GSL classification should not be the sole criterion," he said. "If the Government genuinely wants people to treat medicines with respect, it should demonstrate by public policy that medicines will be offered for sale in premises where they are treated differently from other products and where expert advice is always available the pharmacy."
<p>
The president said that the Society had heeded the advice of Lord Peston, the recently retired Privy Council nominee on the RPSGB Council. Lord Peston had "regularly reminded the Council that the Nuffield inquiry had been thwarted time and time again by the absence of basic data about pharmacy and in particular, community pharmacy", said Mr Caldwell.
<p>
"I am pleased to say that Council has moved to correct that deficiency," he reported. "Not only have we commissioned research on managed care and disease management packages, but also a baseline study on the access to and use of pharmacies from the British Market Research Bureau."
<p>
Practice research and research into consumer attitudes is now seen as important throughout the profession, he declared. The Society's practice research division is moving towards creating a policy research unit, and he was pleased to say that there is strong support for a jointly-funded, continuing research programme.
<p>
Before leaving the subject of RPM, the president warned of the Department of Trade and Industry's proposals to reform competition law. Although the proposals have been mooted since 1989, it appears there is a Bill to implement some of the Government's policies in the last parliamentary session before the election.
<p>
"It is proposed to provide for the DGFT to make a decision on whether any agreement or practice which, on the face of it, is anti-competitive, should be permitted to continue." 
<p>
Although the DTI has recognised that special consideration must be given to arrangements such as RPM for medicines, the Society will continue to put forward its views to that organisation.

<hr>
<CENTER><H3>Educational issues</H3></CENTER>
The extension of the pharmacy degree course meant that although the science base would be maintained, there must also be "patient orientation in teaching, rather than concentration on the medicinal product, as there once was", said Mr Caldwell. Having communication skills but no knowledge to transmit is worthless. Similarly, having expert knowledge but no communication skills to convey that expertise is of no benefit to the users of pharmacists' services.
<p>
As for the 'fallow' year, Mr Caldwell saw no reason for the change to the four-year degree leading to serious workforce shortages. "The profession successfully managed the change from a two-year diploma to one lasting three years and then to all degree entry," he said.

<CENTER><H1>New Age visions for the future</H1></CENTER>

<CENTER><STRONG>The Royal Pharmaceutical Society had published two documents resulting from the 'Pharmacy in a New Age' consultations. 'Summary of responses' outlines the views of the 5,000 who replied. 'The New Horizon' lays down Council's strategy for the future
</STRONG></CENTER><p>
The profession must continue to have a strong presence in the community as an accessible source of advice and products, says 'The New Horizon'. The following are its 'visions for the future':
<li>people will regard pharmacists not only as essential in managing medicine supply, but as a vital source of information on their use 
<li>pharmacists must have more time and better facilities to offer specialised services for particular groups of patients, with a wide range of services outside the pharmacy itself. Clinical skills will need to be developed
<li>community pharmacists will increasingly work alongside GPs and nurses as part of the primary care team, helping with prescribing and medicines management. Some pharmacists might become full team partners, others will manage a pharmacy on the team's premises and some will contract for specific services
<li>more pharmacists will be freelance or peripatetic, offering services to GPs, consumer groups, other pharmacists or purchasers of healthcare. Some will develop specific areas of expertise or packages of services that can be adopted as a standard approach over a wider area
<li>pharmacists will help monitor the success of healthcare by collecting data on the use and effectiveness of different treatments
<li> pharmacy must be fully committed to evaluating the care and services it provides
<li>continuing education will be recognised as both a lifelong obligation and a ladder to higher specialist qualifications.
<p>

<H3>Action plan</H3>
The Council, working with members throughout the profession, aims to develop a streamlined, effective organisation to make this vision a reality. 
<p>

A 12-month programme in 'The New Horizon' outlines 22 commitments, set out under five themes:
<li>maximising pharmacy's contribution to better health
<li>improving accessibility and availability of pharmacy services
<li>guaranteeing high standards
<li>achieving lifelong learning
<li>seizing the professional initiative.
Council will bring together representatives of healthcare professions, patient groups and others to agree how pharmacists can contribute to healthcare developments, particularly in managing prescribed medicines, chronic conditions and common ailments, and promoting and supporting healthy lifestyles. An initial report will be issued by September next year.
<p>
<b>Skill mix:</b> Council believes pharmacy services will be more varied in the future. Although pharmacists' expertise will be widely needed, the size of the workforce will be determined by supply and demand. A more appropriate deployment would lead to a better service to the public, by sharing the workload and reducing professional isolation.
<p>
Options to explore include:
<li>community pharmacies having or sharing a second or even third pharmacist
<li>a larger role for business or practice managers to release pharmacists for professional duties
<li>greater use of technicians
<li>reviewing the range of professional activities requiring a pharmacist to be present
<li>developing pharmacies as centres for health where other professionals might also practise.
A paper for wider discussion will be issued by next May.
<p>
<b>Remuneration and distribution: </b>Council will invite interested bodies from inside and outside the profession to join a review of alternative remuneration structures for those providing community pharmacy services. 
<p>
A progress report will be issued by September next year and Council will press for early follow-up action.
<p>
Council will re-examine what would constitute the most rational distribution of pharmacies and an internal working group will issue an interim report by December. A paper for wider discussion will be issued by May.
<p>
<b>Doctor dispensing: </b>Council will seek dialogue with the medical profession on how conflict might be reduced. Meanwhile, Council's policy is to encourage research into the benefits of care provided by pharmacists and to demonstrate these benefits to patients and Government. 
<p>
Government and purchasers will be pressed to restrict GP dispensing to areas where a pharmacy service cannot reasonably be provided.
<p>
<STRONG>Professional standards:</STRONG> Council will review its policy on standards for pharmacy premises and practice, with a view to ensuring minimum acceptable standards are routinely reviewed at least every two years. Incentives will be developed for individuals to achieve excellent standards.
<p>
The review, to be published by next June, will examine the long-term possibility of moving towards assessment of competence as a requirement for the continued right to practise.
<p>
<STRONG>Continuing professional development:</STRONG> Proposals for a new system of CPD directed towards evidence-based practice will be published by September next year. Practices that benefit patient outcomes will be promoted and ineffective practices replaced. 
<p>

<H3>Summary </H3>
One message emerges from the responses to the consultation: the profession needs to change significantly if it is to have the role it would want in the future.
<p>
Almost every response stressed the pharmacist's availability and accessibility as important. Promoting pharmacy through effective marketing was a common theme, as were setting and achieving high standards. 
<p>
Many called for evidence of the value of pharmacy, through audit and research. 
<p>
Many wanted to spend less time on the mechanical aspects of dispensing and the sale of non-health-related products. They also expressed a desire to reduce paperwork, including collection of NHS prescription charges.
<p>
Core activities of the future were seen to be advice and counselling, dispensing, health promotion, the sale of non-prescription medicines, medicines management and a role as 'first port of call' for healthcare.

<H3><STRONG>Profile of a parasite</STRONG></H3>
Not only do parasites have effects on their hosts, they are also profoundly affected by their hosts. Parasitism involves interaction between invader and defender. The physiologies of both become intertwined in complex ways, and this is as true of external parasites as it is of internal ones.
<P>
We easily imagine the effects of headlice on people, but forget  what human physiological defences are doing to the lice. When any blood-sucking insect (be it flea, mosquito or louse) bites us, it injects saliva into our skin. The saliva has many components, including a fast-acting anaesthetic substance, which stops the biting process from being noticeable while the insect is still present. (Immediate pain might well bring immediate retaliation!)
<P>
Saliva also contains an anticoagulant to prevent the blood from clotting in the insect's feeding tubes and causing a fatal blockage. Naturally, saliva has a range of digestive enzymes, which are also injected into the wound. The proboscis contains two tubes. Down one is pumped saliva and up the second is drawn a mixture of blood plus anticoagulant saliva.
<P>
Bite reactions are local allergic responses to this injected insect material. As with other allergies, we cannot react until we have become sensitised. Very young children do not respond to insect bites, which is why flea or mosquito bites are never seen on babies. Sensitisation rarely occurs before four years of age, even with the commoner insects. Before sensitisation, a bite leaves no mark or reaction at all. After, the familiar red, itchy papule follows each bite. If biting continues, the subject eventually becomes desensitised. They then possess a full quota of antibodies against the saliva of that species of insect.
<P>
With headlice, children most frequently become sensitised between the ages of four and six. Before then, they may be carrying lice but show no symptoms and are not aware of it - nor are the parents. 
<P>
Sensitised children develop a bite reaction, rather like a miniature mosquito bite, shortly after each louse feeds. The lice may be numerous and each may feed up to six times a day. The bites come thick and fast, and a general itch of the head develops. However, because the bites are numerous, desensitisation may set in quite quickly. Desensitised ten-year-olds are not uncommon.
<P>
At desensitisation, all symptoms cease and will never restart. Lice feeding on such people take in antibodies against their own digestive enzymes with every drop of blood they consume. Their digestion becomes poor, their bodies ill-nourished and their rate of reproduction low. This is our immunological defence against them.
<P>
Many desensitised adults cannot keep lice at all. Others keep low numbers of unhappy insects which are only too ready to transfer to a better host. These are the dangerous carriers of lice - symptomless, unaware, long-term, adult carriers of small numbers of malnourished insects.
<P>
The most significant carriers are obviously adults in the general community. These are the people who keep the problem going. This is why no amount of child or school-orientated activity has much effect, or ever has had. If the carriers are not found, there will be a continuous never-ending flood of cases, no matter what else is done.
<P>
The epidemiology of headlouse infections resembles that of typhoid. Both are diseases kept running by cryptic unaware carriers and only the secondary cases are obvious. The numbers of apparent typhoid cases depends little on the degree of transmission between the secondary cases. Levels are more dependent on the number of symptomless unaware carriers and how their social contacts allow the disease to affect the surrounding community. Treatment of secondary cases can never end an outbreak.
<P>
As with typhoid, so with headlice. The numbers of cases in children (secondary cases) depend less on the amount of transmission between them than on the numbers of unaware carriers in the general community and the ways in which their social contact allow them to infect their surrounding population. Treatment of secondary cases alone can never end a louse outbreak and never has.
<P>
Nearly all infections are caught through head to head contacts. Normally a rather prolonged, steady contact is needed, which means that the insects are usually caught from someone who is in an affectionate relationship with the recipient. This gives families a chance of discovering the carrier responsible for their problem.
<P>
Families should write down the names of everyone the patient could have had a two-minute, steady, head to head contact with during the past month. They should include everyone, no matter how unlikely, for carriers usually are unlikely.
<P>
Most people make few such contacts. The list will be short, but, if accurate, on it will be someone who has lice but does not know it. The family should ask everyone on the list to check for lice using a detection comb, 'just in case'. Often the carrier will not be found, but if the attempt is made, sometimes one will be discovered. Then real progress has been made at last.

<P>

Since April 1, new health authorities have been formed by amalgamating family health services authorities and district health authorities. These are now responsible for purchasing primary, secondary and community services to meet healthcare needs in their area. It is now the role of each new health authority to formulate and disseminate a policy for the treatment of headlice in its area.
<P>
Current informed opinion recommends that such policies are rotational in nature. The aim is to prevent the development of resistance which occurs when insects are continually exposed to any insecticide. This is achieved by using each selected insecticide for a period of three years. GPs are advised to prescribe, and pharmacists to stock and sell, only that product. 
<P>
Community pharmacists must be informed of proposed changes to the rotation policy well in advance so that they are not left with unwanted formulations. Difficulties can arise when a pharmacy is situated near district bound-aries and when a particular product is demanded.
<P>
The spread of resistance also depends on the proper use of insecticides and this is where education and counselling by the pharmacist are essential.
<P>
Contrary to popular belief, the source of headlice problems lies in the community and not in schools. In the past, school nurses carried out routine inspection of children's heads. This was based on the misconception that schools were the main sources of infestation and that heavily-infested children could easily be identified by head inspections and then treated. This practice helped to perpetuate the 'dirty heads' stigma.
<P>
Routine head inspections in schools are ineffective and are no longer undertaken. A quick inspection may identify very 'lousy' children, but will not reveal those with just a few lice. Children who have been checked assume that they are free of infection and they and their parents may not bother to carry out preventative measures.
<P>
Carriers are often adults who have been desensitised to lice and are unaware of their presence as they have few symptoms. Action in schools alone is ineffective, but headlice have been eradicated from whole communities by community-based education and proper treatment and contact tracing.
<P>
Health authority pharmaceutical advisers and community services pharmacists (CSPs) are usually involved in the formulation of local policies and must provide guidelines, education and training so that consistent advice is available. Carbaryl is now the only insecticide which is not affected by resistance problems and GPs must understand the importance of its conservation.
<P>
School nurses have a key role in educating teachers, children and parents, and ensuring effective contact tracing. Health visitors and district nurses have a prime educational function in the family situation. It is important that, in the community, all healthcare professionals are aware of the local policy and work together to provide consistent advice about prevention, detection, transmission and treatment.
<P>
Since the withdrawal of Crown Immunity in 1991, most community health trusts no longer issue free lotions to the public. These are now supplied from community pharmacies on prescription or by direct sale. Increasingly, the pharmacy is the source of information, advice and treatment.
<P>
The private counselling area in the pharmacy is the ideal place for the pharmacist or assistant to advise the patient on the proper use of the insecticide and the prevention and detection of lice. The importance of contact tracing must also be stressed and it is essential that accurate information replaces 'old wives' tales' and the stigma still attached to infection is removed. 
<P>
It seems unlikely that we will have any new insecticides in the near future, so we must maintain the efficacy of the ones we have. Many health authorities have excellent policies and guidelines, but they are not widely communicated or reinforced. The formation of the new health authorities should make it easier to produce integrated policies that are widely disseminated and followed.
<P>
It is estimated that annually in the UK approximately three million children are treated for headlice, but only 50-60,000 new cases are reported, indicating the extent of inappropriate use of insecticides.
<P>
The withdrawal of insecticidal shampoos from the market could greatly improve the current situation, where much unnecessary prophylactic 'ritual' hair washing occurs through a basic lack of understanding of the problem. Pharmacists and their assistants have a key role to play in educating patients to use insecticides appropriately - so that we always remain one step ahead of the head louse.

<P>
<A HREF="#top">Top of page</A>
<HR>
<A NAME="c"></A>
<H3><B>A suitable case for treatment</B></H3>
<P>

Accepting that the pharmacist is satisfied that live lice are present on the patient, the first question to be considered is whether insecticidal treatment is appropriate in the presented conditions. Excluded from product licences are young infants and pregnant women. It is prudent, too, to exclude those with a compromised auto-immune system.
<P>
It is also worth considering whether the patient can undertake removal of live lice and eggs by a grooming method. Although such a method will work, not many patients will have the discipline to keep to the strict procedures (compliance with so-called single treatment methods seem to create problems).
<P>
The formulation of the insecticides is important in the decision on 'how to treat'. The pharmacist might have to consider lotion, shampoo or cream rinse. Happily, the decisions are getting easier; all shampoos have now been, or will be, discontinued - the manufacturers have recognised that it is less than sensible applying a full-strength lousicidal formulation only to have it immediately diluted with gallons of water! 
<P>
Now the choices are between an alcoholic or water-based lotion or a cream rinse with properties similar to a hair conditioner. Alcoholic products have the advantage of being quick-drying and pleasant to look at. It is unlikely that the base has any positive effect in treatment, as lice would not become dried out after such a short contact time, but the mobility of these products might help reach parts that other products may not. Such formulations are not suitable for patients who have excoriated skins, have eczema or have asthma or other bronchial obstruction. The isopropyl alcohol is very drying and has a pungent smell. 
<P>
The aqueous base lotions obviously take a while to dry, but are cosmetically acceptable to most people. Both forms of lotion allow the necessary concentration of lousicide to be in contact with the cuticle of the louse when dry. The properties of the cream rinse formulation are such as to make the patient comply with the method of use without difficulty (like a traditional hair conditioner). This particular presentation has the disadvantage of being the most expensive.
<P>
The choice of insecticide has also become easier for the pharmacist. Carbaryl is POM, and Lindane has, for commercial reasons, disappeared from the shelves. 
<P>
The choice is now between malathion and the two synthetic pyrethroid chemicals: d-phenothrin and permethrin. It is probably true to say that, if each was used in an identical way, there would be negligible difference between them. However, commercial requirements necessitate 'unique selling points' (usps) and so variations in use follow. It must also be recognised that the general public do what they think is correct sometimes without reference to printed instructions. 
<P>
The longest residual activities belong to malathion and permethrin, which in some circumstances has advantages where re-infection or freshly-hatched lice may occur. However, it must be remembered that residual activity is a decline in activity and may be a source of worry when the problem of resistance is considered (contact with sub-lethal doses of chemical).
<P>
Lindane, although considered a fairly toxic substance, is still used widely in the Western world to treat lice infections, and there appears to be no withdrawal of licence for its use. Sadly for the manufacturer of the product, it could not find a commercial supplier to continue the production of its well known product, and therefore Quellada became Quellada-M.
<P>
There is little logic in making lice treatments Prescription only. All of us in the community environment know that the average GP does not attempt to diagnose louse infection and that a lot of treatment is purely to keep the family happy. In the pharmacy, despite all the commercial incentives, active infection is confirmed before a sale is made. The ratio of sales to NHS (ie 'free') is near enough 50:50; I have my own opinion where most of the waste and unnecessary supply is sourced.
<P>
One other bone of contention is the so-called rotational policies of health authorities; there are few retail pharmacists who think it is working - partly through professionals not being aware of the scheme or deliberate breaking of the policy when the patient says treatment has failed. There is also the cross-boundary situation when different siblings or neighbours attend different schools in different authorities! 
<P>
It is also impossible to create a scientific basis for rotation with three classes of products when one is Prescription only. The answer is for each 'provider', GP, pharmacist, nurse, etc to adopt their own mosaic system - in other words, to constantly change the provided insecticide in a systematic fashion.
<P>
Finally, insecticides must not be used for preventing infection. One community nurse I came across used to treat herself every two weeks with an insecticide during the months of September and October as she 'knew' she would catch headlice. 
<P>
The easiest method of prevention is good daily grooming, combing damp hair with a proper detection comb - not a dust comb and not a nit removal comb. This will keep a head free of live lice. If, however, chemicals are required, there is a specific repellent available which works by causing the louse to become confused in its temperature-seeking system. 
<P>
Also bear in mind that in certain infected cases there could well be a necessity to re-treat at not less than 14 days. This is to allow any viable eggs to hatch into live lice. This is not considered 'prevention'.

<H3><B>Boots launches GP script collection drive</B></H3>
<P>
Boots the Chemists is targeting pension-collecting post office customers and those living within the vicinity of its stores in a drive to bolster its GP surgery prescription collection service.
<P>
A door to door leaflet drop in London and the South East took place last week, with main post offices throughout "many other areas of the UK" distributing leaflets this week. These will be given to "a targeted audience of people collecting pensions", says a Boots' statement.
<P>
The leaflet promotes Boots' free collection service, which offers "a more convenient way to collect your regular prescriptions". Patients are asked to complete a form, giving their name, address, doctor's name and surgery address, stating that they want Boots to collect their repeat prescriptions. A similar form is completed notifying the surgery of arrangements.
<P>
The company states that customer knowledge of this service is not widespread, hence the recent decision "to publicise its availability". It adds that customers are made aware in the leaflet that they are free to choose where they have their prescriptions dispensed.
<P>
But the National Pharmaceutical Association has expressed concern about the initiative. "The main concern is that elderly patients may feel they have to get their prescriptions dispensed at Boots," says the NPA's head of public relations Colette McCreedy. She adds that the NPA has produced a pack for independents to market their collection and delivery services.
<P>
One pharmacy which fears it will be adversely affected by the campaign is Pharmacy Plus in Bristol, whose neighbouring post office is distributing the Boots' leaflets. 
<P>
"It's particularly ridiculous in this situation as there is a pharmacy next door to the post office offering this service," says manager Joel Hirst, who is writing a formal letter of complaint to the Royal Pharmaceutical Society's Ethics Committee.
<P>
A similar leaflet was the subject of a referral to the Statutory Committee in December, 1993. In this case, collection service leaflets were distributed to pensioners through post offices in the south of England. It was said that this link contravened the Code of Ethics by exploiting consumers' lack of knowledge.

<H3><B>Pharmacists advising only one in twelve asthmatics</B></H3>
<P>
In the past year, only 8 per cent of patients with asthma received any advice from a pharmacist, according to preliminary results of a nationwide survey commissioned by the National Asthma Campaign.
<P>
The Impact of Asthma survey gathered information from over 44,000 people with asthma. One in four respondents said their condition totally controlled their life or had a major effect on it. Four out of ten experienced asthma symptoms every day or most days and a similar number were woken at night at least once a week by a cough, wheeze or breathlessness.
<P>
Although recent years have seen the development of asthma initiatives, and awareness of the condition and its management has grown as a result of media attention, nearly half of the respondents (46 per cent) felt they had insufficient informa-tion about how to control their problem.
<P>
"As 85 per cent of asthmatics are on repeat prescriptions, pharmacists can keep an eye on the way in which their regular customers are managing their asthma and advise when another visit to the doctor might be appropriate, as well as on issues such as inhaler technique," says Dr Alison Blenkinsopp, director of education and research at the department of pharmacy policy and practice at Keele University.

<H3><B>Western European pharmacy numbers will fall</B></H3>
<P>
The number of pharmacies and drugstores in western Europe will fall from 92,534 in 1994 to 91,991 in 2000, although sales through such outlets will grow by 13.8 per cent to $102.7 billion (1=$1.53).
<P>
The fall in pharmacy and drugstores reverses the trend seen between 1990 and 1994 when the number in western Europe grew by 11.5 per cent. Sales rose 37 per cent during this period to $90.2bn, according to a recently published Euromonitor report, "Pharmacies & drugstores - a world survey".
<P>
The fall in pharmacies and drugstores over the next five years will be driven by a 20 per cent drop in the number of drugstores. These face increased competition from general retailers, especially supermarket chains, and greater retaliation from traditional pharmacies. The report predicts that drugstores will rationalise their product ranges and concentrate on the beauty and healthcare sectors, where they perform well.
<P>
There will be an increase in the number of pharmacies changing hands in the UK, says Euromonitor, as chains consolidate and upgrade their services. The company also predicts an increase in customer loyalty programmes in order to stave off competition from other retailing sectors.
<P>
Government preoccupation with script numbers has led to an increase in sales of OTC products. Boots is set to capitalise on this by launching 400 own-brand OTC products over the next five years, says the report.
<P>
Health promotion programmes are becoming more common, fuelled by the move towards self-medication and the perceived need to stimulate the role of the pharmacist in OTC retailing, says the report. Details from Euromonitor. Tel: 0171 251 8024.

<H3><B>MSD recalls Aldomet packs</B></H3>
<P>
Merck Sharp & Dohme is recalling Aldomet (methyldopa) after tests revealed its failure to meet the product licence dissolution specification.
<P>
The following batches of Aldomet 125mg, all 100 tablet packs expiring 9/99, are affected: 
<P>
HA22070    HB09310    HB09330    HB09330/1. 
<P>
Aldomet 250mg 100-packs, all expiring 1/2000, affected: 
<P>
HA26210    HA34040    HB39300   HB22220 (a 500-tablet which also expires 1/2000).
<P>
Finally, Aldomet 500mg, 100-pack, expiring 9/99:
<P>
HA01740    HA24890.

<H3><B>MMC clears Tambrands discount practice</B></H3>
<P>
The Monopolies and Mergers Commission has decided that Tambrands' practice of granting discounts on condition that all or part of the company's range of tampons is stocked by the retailer is not anti-competitive.
<P>
The case, which was referred to the MMC in June last year, concerns clauses in Tambrands' special terms with nine multiple retailers and in its chemist wholesaler terms, which state that the full range of Tambrands should be stocked. In return for this, multiple retailers and wholesalers receive additional discounts.
<P>
The Commission found that most retailers chose to stock the full Tambrands' range because consumers want to buy these products, not because of the range-stocking condition.
<P>
The MMC also found that:
<UL>
<LI>Tambrands did not enforce the condition for all products
<LI>given the bargaining strength of purchasers subject to the range-stocking condition, in practice <LI>Tambrands could not force them to buy products that it was not in their interest to buy
<LI>the condition did not act as a barrier to entry because it did not restrict the retail space available for competitors, nor did it affect competitors' ability to supply through wholesalers
<LI>the full range-stocking condition was intended to serve as Tambrands' opening bargaining position with retailers and to promote the distribution of Tambrands' products.
</UL>
<P>
Tambrands accounts for 60 per cent of tampon sales by volume in the UK. The MMC reported on the supply of tampons in 1980 and 1986, and on neither occasion did it recommend steps to bring about more active competition in the UK tampon market. (The earlier reports covered the whole industry, while the latest report focuses on Tambrands.)

<H3><B>Scherer temazepam case in High Court</B></H3>
<P>
Swindon capsule manufacturer R P Scherer, which claims it stands to lose millions because of the Government's decision to ban temazepam gel-filled capsules on NHS prescription, was in the High Court on Wednesday seeking a judicial review. Health secretary Stephen Dorrell announced the move on October 17, 1995, and it came into effect on January 1.
<P>
Scherer, which controls 67 per cent of the UK market for temazepam capsules, claims the ban is "disproportionate and discriminatory", and will cost the company 2 million of its 35m annual turnover.
<P>
Mr Dorrell, when announcing the ban, said the gel-filled capsules "constituted a risk to public health and safety when injected by drug misusers".
<P>
Scherer's QC, Michael Beloff, claimed the secretary of state had misused his powers. European law had also been breached, he added, as Mr Dorrell had not shown "transparency in explanation" as to why the capsules were withdrawn.
<P>
Temazepam capsules were a "valuable therapeutic product which is now unavailable solely because of its misuse by drug abusers", said Mr Beloff. "What  is public health and safety? Is its remit determined by a small number of drug abusers?" The hearing was expected to last two to three days.

<H3><B>Patient education campaign launched</B></H3>
<P>
The Department of Health has launched a 2.75 million patient education campaign aimed at fostering partnership and co-operation between doctors and patients.
<P>
The Doctor/Patient Partnership, developed jointly with the British Medical Association, has been designed to help patients think more about how they use family doctor services; give patients more information to make better judgments about their health; and help them take greater responsibility for their own health. 
<P>
The campaign consists of 750,000 of national press advertising running over four weeks and 20,000 of allocations to health authorities for local initiatives. A public service television filler is also being developed.
<P>
Royal Pharmaceutical Society deputy secretary Phil Green says: "As a first port of call for advice and treatment of common ailments pharmacists have shown they have a role to play in helping to reduce unnecessary visits to GP surgeries. GPs appreciate that role and it is one that is set to grow.''
<P>
A National Pharmaceutical Association spokesperson says: "We welcome this initiative because it underlines the message of the 'Ask Your Pharmacist' campaign started ten years ago. One benefit of that campaign was to free up the GP and make better use of the pharmacist. It is another example of doctors and pharmacists working in synergy.''

<H3><B>CPAG launches first phase of RPM defence campaign</B></H3>
<P>
The Community Pharmacy Action Group is launching the first phase of its Resale Price Maintenance defence campaign.
<P>
In a low-key approach, the focus will be on: lobbying MPs, targeting the run-up to local Government elections in May; mobilising pharmacists; building up a media relations programme, and developing third-party support through other health professionals and voluntary organisations. In addition, the group is engaged in a data-gathering exercise to determine the full impact of the possible loss of RPM.
<P>
David Sharpe, outgoing Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee chairman and CPAG chair, dismissed accusations at a press briefing last week that the group had missed valuable time since the Office of Fair Trading announced its RPM investigation last November. "We are not convinced that the OFT will find the evidence that it needs to go to the Restrictive Practices Court, and we have got to wait till that moment to go for a large-scale campaign," he said.
<P>
Despite reports that the OFT was to deliver the report this month, the timetable has slipped and conclusions may not be reached now until the autumn.
<P>
Mr Sharpe suggested that another opportunity to state the pro-RPM case may come in June, when Asda, the main instigator in the anti-RPM controversy, is expected to launch its own-brand vitamins.
<P>
Tim Astill, director of the National Pharmaceutical Association, comments: "It will be very much easier to publish details to back our case when we have the facts and figures from the data collection."
<P>
Mr Sharpe summed up the possible dilemma under the SAVE acronym: Service, Availability of range, Value and Ease of access.
<P>
"If RPM were to go, there is a strong possibility - which I have never said in relation to remuneration - that pharmacies will close," warned Mr Sharpe. The impact would also extend to GPs, who would face a greater work burden, and difficulty for vulnerable groups to access pharmacies. 
<P>
Mr Astill disputed the argument that RPM loss would lead to an increase in consumer choice and drop in prices. "There is no shred of evidence that it [the abolition of RPM on other goods in 1970] has reduced prices," he says.
<P>
Pharmacists are urged to write to their member of parliament to push the profession's concerns about the OFT review. PSNC asks that all contractors notify it of action taken, including a copy of correspondence.
<UL>
<LI>Labour this week vowed to fight to keep resale price maintenance for medicines as an essential aid to community pharmacists. Henry McLeish, shadow health minister, told C&D that the ending of the scheme could spark a price war and drive small pharmacies out of business. "We are concerned about the impact this could have, particularly on pharmacists in rural areas," he says. "It is our presumption that we would want to maintain RPM." Mr McLeish says a decision on the future of the scheme is likely to fall to an incoming Labour Government. "We want to maintain a network of community pharmacies, because we believe that one of the principles of the NHS should be that drugs are accessible."

<H3><B>NPA has 'no objections' to Lloyds takeover bids</B></H3>
<P>
Other retail pharmacies are unlikely to be significantly affected by either Unichem's or Gehe's takeover bid for Lloyds, the National Pharmaceutical Association is to tell the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
<P>
NPA Board members agreed that they have no strong objection to either takeover bid. Members who were close to Lloyds' branches would simply see a change of competitor's name. 
<P>
The NPA will point out to the MMC that the loss of the Daniels wholesaler arm would not be in the interests of members or the public, since a second wholesaler is a back-up to ensure that all prescriptions are dispensed with reasonable promptness.

<H3><B>Healthy half-time results at Lloyds</B></H3>
<P>
Lloyds Chemists has announced healthy mid-year results, while bidders Unichem and Gehe are having to sit it out awaiting investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.  
<P>
Turnover was up 2.1 per cent to 562 million and operating profit rose 3.4 per cent to 31.2m. Pre-tax profits, however, stood at 25.8m compared to 26.6m the previous year, the fall being blamed on higher interest costs and disposal of surplus property, which led to losses of 1.1m in the first half-year.
<P>
Sales in the chemist division  rose by 5.9 per cent in the first half, rising from 241.4m to 255.6m, with like for like increases of 4.3 per cent. The total number of pharmacies stood at 924 at the end of last year.
<P>
Michael Ward, group managing director for Lloyds, says the solid progress in chemists has been driven by medicines - including NHS business and OTC medicines - which makes up 81 per cent of the turnover for the division. A refurbishment programme and investment in training have also contributed to growth. 
<P>
The pharmaceutical division increased external sales from 181.6m to 184.5m, with Daniels Pharmaceuticals benefiting from a co-ordinated marketing campaign.
<P>
Mr Ward says the interim results were much in line with what the market was expecting and what bidders Unichem and Gehe were looking for. "They will see it as one more step [for the business] and will be encouraged by the performances of our core businesses," he explains. 
<P>
However, he adds that the company was disappointed about the referral of the bids to the MMC, whose report is expected towards the end of July, because it did not consider it to affect competition or public interest. "It has had a negative impact on our business, because it creates uncertainty, but people we have spoken to understand the situation," he says.
<P>
The board has declared an interim dividend of 310p per share, an increase of 6.9 per cent on last year, payable on June 7 to shareholders on the register on May 6, 1996.
<P>
The scrip dividend alternative which had been made to shareholders since 1993 has been suspended until the outcome of the MMC report and the current bid situation has been resolved.

Nine candidates are standing for the seven places in this year's Royal Pharmaceutcial Society Council elections. Six Council members are standing for re-election: David Allen, Geoffrey Booth, Ian Caldwell, Ann Lewis, Allan Nathan and Hemant Patel. A further three new candidates are also standing: Pat Hoare, Ian Jones and Bryan Veitch.
<P>
Voting papers will be sent out on April 15 and must be returned completed to the Society by May 17.
<P>
In addition, seven candidates are nominated for the five honorary Society auditors' positions: John Balmford, Richard Clitherow, Geoffrey Knowles, Mervyn Madge, David Massam, Roger Phillips and Dr Brian Wills.

<H3><B>Dispensing costs drop by 18% in real terms over a decade</B></H3>
<P>
The dispensing cost per prescription has fallen by over 18 per cent in real terms over the past ten years, from a high point of 1.78 in 1986-7 to 1.45 in 1994-5. Since 1993-4, the average cost of dispensing prescriptions has fallen by 4 per cent in real terms.
<P>
Pharmacy and appliance contractors dispensed an average of 42,380 prescriptions in 1994-5, a 2.6 per cent increase on the previous year and 26.8 per cent up on 1984-85, according to the Department of Health's report on the Government's expenditure plans for 1996-7 to 1998-99.
<P>
The Government intends to take further action to curb drug spending, even though the rate of growth in the drugs bill is likely to be less in 1995-6 than in any of the past three years.
<P>
The report predicts a real-terms increase in the drugs bill of 6 per cent this year, 1.4 per cent less than in 1994-95, but still higher than the average over the past ten years (5.2 per cent).
<P>
Cost-cutting measures will continue to address "inappropriate and uneconomic" prescribing. Some recent growth in the primary care drugs bill is being attributed to an inappropriate increase in doctors prescribing 'high-tech' healthcare for pat-ients at home.
<P>
Some responsibility for this type of care has been transferred to hospital and community health services budgets to ensure better value for money with local or central purchasing arrangements.
<P>
The report adds that the Department remains fully committed to developing the professional role of community pharmacists where it can be shown to be cost-effective.

<H3><B>Nutricia's acquisition of Milupa referred to MMC</B></H3>
<P>
NV Nutricia's acquisition of Milupa has been referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission because of its implications to the baby milks and meals market in the UK. 
<P>
The referral, under the provisions of the Fair Trading Act, was brought about in view of Nutricia's wholly-owned subsidiary, Cow & Gate. The MMC is required to make its report by July 12.
<P>
Cow & Gate Nutricia says it will "co-operate fully" with the MMC in its evaluations, as it has done with the Office of Fair Trading, and will be waiting for it to make the next move.

<P>
Rumours surrounding the sale of Seven Seas to E Merck were labelled just that by parent company Hanson.
<P>
A Hanson spokesman says the company cannot comment on market speculation, which indicates that Seven Seas is being sold for an estimated 150 million as part of Hanson's break-up plans, announced in January. 
<P>
A spokesman for E Merck confirms that the company is currently in discussions with Hanson.

Prescription endorsement is a challenging aspect of the Drug Tariff for many community pharmacists, so in the following pages, dotPHARMACY is pleased to provide on-line access to some of the latest guidance from the Pharmaceuctical Services Negotiating Committee.
<P>
To use the tables, first find the product in the A-Z List, then refer to the Key to Abbreviations for the special container definition. Except for A, B and C, each initial letter loads quickly as a single file. Links back to the abbreviations and A-Z index are provided from the top of each page.
<P><BR>

<B>Special container rules (see Drug Tariff clauses 10B and 13)</B>
<P>
A special container is a pack which for physical or pharmaceutical reasons should not be split. A number or combination of special containers nearest to the quantity ordered must be dispensed (clause 10B). Where the quantity prescribed falls exactly halfway between multiples of special containers then the smaller quantity is to be dispensed. However when the preparation requires reconstitution from granules or powder payment will be based on the nearest pack or number of packs necessary to cover the quantity ordered (clause 13).
<P>
<BR>
<B>Calendar pack rules (see Drug Tariff clause 10C)</B>
<P>
A calendar pack consists of one or more subpacks in the form of a blister or strip pack showing the days of the week or month against each blister or compartment. In the absence of an endorsement payment will be based on the assumption that a number of subpacks nearest to the quantity ordered has been dispensed. As with special containers when the quantity prescribed falls exactly halfway between multiples of subpacks then the smaller quantity is to be dispensed.  If  the pharmacist believes the prescriber intended the patient to have the exact quantity prescribed where this does not coincide with a whole number of subpacks then this quantity should be dispensed and endorsed to ensure correct payment.
<P>
<BR>


<a name="abbrlist"></a>
<B>Introduction to the list</B>
<P>
The list of special containers and calendar packs compiled by the National Prescription Research Centre (0181 882 3888) is comprehensive but not exhaustive since many products are included as a class eg eye drops. The key to the entries is as follows:-

<A NAME="a"></A>
<H3><B>Gehe to take its time with Lloyds</B></H3>
<P>

Dieter K&auml;mmerer, Gehe's chairman, met Lloyds' management this week to begin the process of integrating the two companies after rival bidders Unichem withdrew from the race.
<P>
Stefan Meister, AAH's group finance director, says Gehe wants to get an impression of Lloyds. But the German company will not make any decisions until it has conducted a lengthy review of its new acquisition. That review could take three to six months.
<P>
Questions about which parts of Lloyds' business will be divested, who will be appointed to run the remainder, and whether the company's 920 pharmacies will be integrated with Hills' 350 outlets or kept separate, will not be answered until the review is complete. Mr Meister says speculation about whether the Lloyds' name will disappear is not important.
<P>
Jeff Harris, Unichem's chief executive, maintains that the German group will have a big integration problem. Mr Meister disagrees. The full story appears in the business news pages of Chemist &amp; Druggist magazine this week.

<A NAME="b"></A>
<H3><B>PSNC 'refining approach' for 1997-98 pay round</B></H3>
<P>

Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee chairman Wally Dove says that the Committee is "refining its approach to the Department" over next year's pay negotiations. With the 1996-97 round only recently settled, PSNC has two main considerations: the possible role of the Pharmacy Review Panel and the remuneration proposals in the 'Pharmacy in a New Age' initiative.  
<P>
The Committee "is firmly against any attempt to redistribute remuneration for the dispensing service to pay for new roles". However, it says that the remuneration system should be equitable and reward fairly those contractors providing additional pharmaceutical services.
<P>
As such, PSNC is still considering possible additional methods of remuneration. "We are not looking for a complete alternative, but add-ons," says Mr Dove.
<P>
<A HREF="#top">Top of page</A>

<A NAME="c"></A>
<H3><B>Oxygen delivery</B></H3>
<P>

Following misleading advice from some health authorities, the NHSE has agreed that the existing domiciliary oxygen arrangements for set hire and cylinder supply will continue until the NHS Bill is law, when the health secretary may then direct for services to continue.
<P>
Further details appear in Chemist &amp; Druggist this week.

<A NAME="d"></A>
<H3><B>Paracetamol recall raises safety issues</B></H3>
<P>

A recall of paracetamol in GSL packs has again raised concerns over the sale of medicines from non-pharmacy outlets. Certain packs of Aspar Pharm-aceuticals' paracetamol tablets BP 500mg, distributed by Batleys, omit dosage instructions, the Product Licence number and supplier name. 
<P>
The Medicines Control Agency issued a product recall on January 9, shortly after Aspar became aware of the problem and informed the MCA. Concern has been expressed that although the MCA's warning will remove the product from pharmacy shelves, no similar system exists for other retailers who could sell GSL medicines. 
<P>
The recall message for non-pharmacy outlets has to be directed by way of a system designed to alert local authorities on food safety. Health and trading standards officers in the areas where the 13 Batley outlets deliver have been warned, and the recall has been advertised locally and in the national press.

<H3><B>PSNC responds to latest Government White Paper</B></H3>
<P>

The Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee has responded to the latest White Paper, welcoming its recognition of the importance of community pharmacy in primary care 'Primary Care: Delivering the Future' sets out 70 proposals to improve patient care and complements the Primary Care Bill currently before parliament.
<P>
In a letter to health secretary Stephen Dorrell, PSNC secretary Stephen Axon says "further enhancement of the pharmacy role as the first point of contact with primary care should be a priority". Describing the pace of development of additional NHS services for community pharmacy as "disappointingly slow", Mr Axon says: "PSNC hopes that the White Paper will provide the impetus for more rapid development in the future."

<H3><B>Health-Plus - still in DoH discussions</B></H3>
<P>

Talks between the Department of Health and Practice Resource Systems, the creator of the Health Plus electronic prescription transfer system, broke up on January 10 without any agreement on whether the company could proceed. The talks followed a circular from the NHS Executive advising pharmacists, GPs and health authorities not to enter into sales agreements with companies providing such systems  <a href="jan11.html">(NHSE warns on script transfer systems, January 11) </a>.
<P>
Senior department officials met PRS at the NHSE in Leeds last week in what were described by both sides as "constructive talks". This week, an NHSE spokesman saidt the Executive was still in talks with the company. An Executive Letter, which was to follow the warning, has been put on hold pending discussions as to its content, he added.
<P>
PRS's managing director, Gary Noon, advised that there may significant developments in the near future.

<H3><B>New R&amp;D unit for Queen's</B></H3>
<P>

A new pharmaceutical research facility opened this week at the School of Pharmacy at the Queen's University of Belfast as the result of the school's joint venture with local pharmaceutical company Galen.
<P>
The laboratory will carry out research on novel drug delivery systems, with special emphasis on the area of women's health. 
<P>
Queen's School of Pharmacy's expertise in drug delivery systems complements Galen's manufacturing capabilities, according to Professor David Woolfson, director of the new unit and head of the school's research division.

<H3><B>Ranitidine launch coup</B></H3>
<P>

Generics UK has obtained a licence from Glaxo Wellcome to sell ranitidine Form 2 six months before the patent for Form 1 runs out [Form 2's patent expires in 2002, while that for Form 1 does so on July 25]. Under a  confidential agreement, Generics UK will launch ranitidine Form 2 on January 25. The generic will be supplied to 60 wholesalers in the UK. 
<P>
Ranitidine Form 2 will come in a choice of either 150mg tablets in calendar packs of 60 or 300mg tablets in calendar packs of 30. Despite huge demand for the generic, each wholesaler will be supplied an unspecified amount only because of limited supplies.
<P>
Jackie Gregory, Generics UK's marketing director, says this is the biggest-ever generic launch in the UK.

Ceuta Healthcare specialises in representing UK-based healthcare companies. It sells their products to clients who include pharmacies, wholesalers, Boots and the major supermarkets.

<P>

The NHS Executive is warning contractors against making agreements with companies offering systems which transfer prescriptions electronically.The Department of Health says it does not have sufficient information to be satisfied about systems such as Health Plus offered by Practice Resource Systems <a href="sept28.html">(Mixed welcome for PRS, September 28, 1996)</a> It says it is aware of the PRS system, but says there may be other such companies and systems.
<P>
Among the DoH's concerns are maintenance of patient confidentiality and more general data protection requirements arising from the transfer of prescription data and compliance with the law on medicines. 
<P>
PRS managing director Gary Noon says the NHSE is entirely wrong. The company is reviewing the situation very seriously. "We are dealing with extremely innovative technology, and the Department has a duty of care." he said.

<H3><B>CPAG faces 2m bill to defend RPM</B></H3>
<P>

The Community Pharmacy Action Group was to discuss this week how to fund the possible 2 million costs needed to defend Resale Price Maintenance on medicines. Although the outcome is now in the hands of the courts, CPAG is continuing its PR campaign to reinforce the message that RPM is still worth fighting for.
<P>
A 150,000 preliminary hearing, expected this spring, will decide whether a full court hearing is justified. CPAG would then have to find a further 1.2m for the legal costs of a full hearing of the Restrictive Practices Court in the spring or summer of 1998.
<P>
CPAG is funded by the eight pharmacy and proprietary medicines organisations it represents. The National Pharmaceutical Association has already asked members for a 10 contribution towards the RPM legal costs as part of this year's fee.

<H3><B>Welsh Office fudges Sharpe's appeal</B></H3>
<P>

Pharmacist Allan Sharpe is claiming victory after the Welsh Office has ruled that a complaint made against him over treating FP10s as private prescriptions is void.
<P>
 The secretary of state was not able to consider Mr Sharpe's appeal against the decision of Mid-Glamorgan Family Health Services Authority to fine him 550 for breach of contract, as the FHSA had not followed the appropriate complaints procedure.
<P>
Although the outcome means the fine has been dropped, no clarification on the legal position has been given. The National Pharmaceutical Association is continuing to advise pharmacists not to dispense FP10s privately.
<P>
Mr Sharpe, of Newbridge, Gwent, says the secretary of state has fudged the outcome. "It is a bizarre position, but it clearly indicates that the NHS is backing away from the issue," he says.

<H3><B>PSNC/NPA bid for funds</B></H3>
<P>
The NHS Executive has had a good response to requests for bids for projects that will develop the community pharmacist's wider role. One is a joint bid from the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee and National Pharmaceutical Association for a national repeat dispensing trial. 
<P>
The Executive is making 750,000 available in 1996-97 for pilot projects on repeat/instalment dispensing, patient compliance and pharmaceutical care for selected patient groups, such as people who have asthma and diabetes. A spokeswoman said this week that the Executive had had over 100 proposals, equally split between the three subjects. She hoped that applicants would be told during next month whether or not they had been successful, but could not say how many of the bids would be accepted. 
<P>
The PSNC/NPA proposal involves 34 LPCs and would cost about 340,000. A few other LPCs have also submitted bids independently, with the approval of their health authorities. 
<P>
PSNC chairman Wally Dove hopes that the NHS Executive will look favourably on the joint bid, because a national survey is most likely to produce 'robust' results. Secretary Stephen Axon believes repeat dispensing trials are a high priority and deserve half the planned spend.

<H3><B>Mixed welcome for PRS</B></H3>
<P>
More details have emerged about the new computerised repeat prescription management system from Practice Resource Systems (C&D September 21, p384). A pharmacy software programme, Health Plus Manager, will link participating pharmacies, via a Government-approved data net, called Healthlink, to GP surgeries, using the Scrip Manager software. 
<P>
'Scrip Manager is one component of Health Plus,' says PRS managing director Gary Noon. Costs to pharmacists have not been finalised, he says, since 'we are trying to create an even playing field for all'. Pharmacists who want to use the Health Plus programme will need a 486 PC capable of running Windows. 
<P>
The software will be supplied to pharmacists free of charge, he suggests, but maintenance and access to Healthlink, the central processing unit, will be 60 per month. There will also be a volume-related transaction charge, which still has to be worked out, but which will be 'pennies per script'. 
<P>
GPs get the software free. Scrip Manager is an emulation system, which means it can sit easily alongside most GP practice systems. VAMP, with whom PRS is linked, is owned by Reuters, whose expertise has been used to develop a secure data transfer system. 
<P>
Health Plus will allow pharmacists presented with scripts to access the patient's medication records held at the surgery. It will generate dispensing labels automatically from the scripts transmitted to the patient's chosen pharmacy, and includes a stock control system and drug interaction alert. 
<P>
E-mail facilities will link pharmacists with GPs. 'In the future, we will be talking to wholesalers about providing EDI links with them,' says Mr Noon. The standard operating system has been presented to the law department at the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, says Mr Noon. 
<P>
There will be no attempt to override patients' choice, he insists. Patients are asked to sign a form to say that they are happy for the pharmacy they select to handle repeats for them. Patients can change their mind at a new pharmacy, back in the surgery, or at the pharmacy they originally selected. Pharmacists (or patients) will still need to collect hard copies of prescriptions from surgeries. These will carry a unique bar code, which identifies them with the electronically-transmitted script. It also ties in with the bar code on the medicine prescribed, reducing the chance of dispensing errors.  
<P>
Participating surgeries and community pharmacies will be identified by a Health Plus sign displayed on the premises. Regional and national consumer advertising is planned later in the year, once systems are in place. PRS is backed by a consortium of venture capitalists and banks, including 3i and the Royal Bank of Scotland. 
<P>
The company is talking about compatibility with existing pharmacy system suppliers, says Mr Noon. He stresses that Health Plus is still undergoing trials, but says that if pharmacists want to buy in, PRS should be able to deliver by November. Four representatives are currently promoting the system. Health authorities are being approached first. Several want to conduct pilots, says Mr Noon, and others want to tie in with repeat prescribing programmes. GP surgeries will then be visited. Once a practice is signed up, local pharmacies will be approached. 
<P>
<LI>The Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee still has 'serious reservations' about some aspects of the Scrip Manager scheme.
<P>
'We are not convinced of any additional patient benefit and cannot therefore endorse the participation of contractors,' said chairman Wally Dove this week. He believes that any scheme linked to prescription volume must work to the disadvantage of smaller to medium-sized pharmacies which do not have the same financial clout as their larger colleagues. 
<P>
'My feeling is that if pharmacy is to be involved in a scheme like this, it should be funded and managed centrally. I would feel much easier with the concept if it were part of the NHS and not run as part of a commercial activity.'
<P>
The National Pharmaceutical Association Board also has a 'number of reservations, not least the fact that doctors joining the scheme were offered a free PC and received the software free of charge, whereas pharmacists would have to pay to be involved'. NPA director Tim Astill says: 'The NPA is always anxious to use new technology ... but IT developments should be equitable between pharmacists. It should not be possible for the wealthy to buy increased market share by using IT to 'capture' patients from other pharmacies.'
<P>
The NPA has set up a small working group to explore the system more fully and discuss possible NPA involvement in the scheme.

<H3><B>PSNC urges DoH to settle claim</B></H3>
<P>

The Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee has written to the health minister urging him to settle the 1996-97 remuneration claim. Chairman Wally Dove told Gerald Malone that there is 'growing frustration and concern within the PSNC and among contractors generally at the deafening silence from your Department'.
<P>
Because of the delay, PSNC will be discussing with the NHS Executive improvements to the negotiating timetable for future years. PSNC submitted the full claim on December 27 last year and rejected the latest (3 per cent) offer in May. Since meeting the minister on June 6, there has been no further offer.
<P>
Mr Dove told a press briefing this week that the problem was completely on the Department's side. His letter to Mr Malone says that: 'A delay of this magnitude is unprecedented. It has an unsettling and demoralising effect on community pharmacists and it does nothing to promote a good working relationship.' 
<P>
<STRONG>Progress on ZD endorsement:</STRONG> from November 1 the ZD list will be in two parts: 
<P>
List A will cover those products where ZD endorsement is not required.  
<br>
List B  will include products which should still be endorsed. List A will be printed in the October Drug Tariff.
<P>
<STRONG>Discount clawback:</STRONG> the NHS Executive has agreed an adjustment to the discount clawback arising from the transfer of refrigerated items to ZD status. The discount balance sheet for 1995-96 shows 1.6 million due to contractors, but the current scale is under-recovering discount for 1996-97, as it is repaying discount overclawed back up to October 1 last year. The 1.6m due on March 31 will now have been cleared and contractors will see an increase in the new discount scale as soon as it can be finalised.
<P>
<STRONG>Container cost inquiry:</STRONG> the container allowance has been agreed at 6.6p per prescription for 1996-97. As contractors are being paid 6.4p at present, they will be paid 6.8p from October 1 until March 31 to balance out the full-year payment. 
<P>
<STRONG>Local budgets:</STRONG> PSNC is to present evidence to the NHS Executive that devolved budgets cannot be properly managed locally. Two health authorities are claiming to have spent significantly more than local pharmaceutical committees calculated on rota and advice to homes for 1995-96. All LPCs will be asked to check for further discrepancies.
<P>
<STRONG>Oxygen devolvement:</STRONG> the NHS Executive is forcing through plans to devolve oxygen, despite problems with rota and advice to homes. 
<P>
<STRONG>Primary Care Bill:</STRONG> the Queen's speech is expected to refer to a Bill which, the national press predicts, may enable general practitioners to offer a broader range of services from 'super surgeries'. PSNC is concerned about the effects on pharmacy distribution if pharmaceutical services were included in these surgeries and hopes to have some input on the proposals. 
<P>
<STRONG>New Age plans:</STRONG> the 'New Horizon' document is 'good in parts', but requires careful study, comments PSNC, which intends to assert its role as the organisation responsible for representing community pharmacists on NHS remuneration and control of entry.
<P>
<STRONG>PSNC dinner 1997:</STRONG> health secretary Stephen Dorrell is to speak as guest of honour at the dinner on March 3.

<H3><B>Call for more involvement in asthma management</B></H3>
<P>

A pharmacist has written to Glaxo Wellcome saying there is little point in attending asthma workshops unless GPs involve pharmacists in managing the disease. Andrew McCoig, chairman of Croydon Local Pharmaceutical Committee, has replied to an invitation to Glaxo's latest workshops, saying that his committee has already been involved with asthma briefings organised by Glaxo, Astra and Fisons. 
<P>
'In spite of all this activity, there have been no significant signs or indications locally that GPs (or anyone else for that matter) wish to involve pharmacists in asthma management as part of the wider primary healthcare team. I now believe that participation in further workshops or training will serve only to increase frustration among many community pharmacists concerning our supposed member-ship of locally-based healthcare teams.'
<P>
Mr McCoig points out that pharmacists receive 94p for dispensing a Ventolin product, but any further intervention is unremunerated, time-consuming and sometimes unwelcome. He suggests two options - that the company funds meaningful local partnerships between GPs and pharmacists, or offers pharmacists locum fees plus additional payment for attending workshops.
<P>
Mr McCoig stresses he is not criticising Glaxo's intentions because 'your contributions are a vital demonstration of faith in the profession'.
<P>
Glaxo Wellcome is disappointed that Mr McCoig has declined the workshop invitation but understands his frustrations.

<H3><B>Relaunch for CM2Plus</B></H3>
<P>

Vantage will re-launch CM2Plus, its front-shop management package, next week. The company says that its updated version has been compiled with the help of retailers' comments about its original CM2Plus system. 
<P>
New sections on the re-launched version include: how to design shop layouts, understanding hot and cold spots in an outlet, getting the best from demand and impulse items, and making the most out of fixtures and fitments.
<P>
Vantage is also supplying a new-look manual that is colour-coded for easier reference, category booklets with reports on facings for best-selling products, and merchandising tips and plans. Revamped stock sheets highlight new lines listed in the best-sellers range and in seasonal products.
<P>
Pat Bunn, the company's inventory manager, says the improved package takes into account pharmacists' needs. 'No one disputes the advantages a front-shop management system can bring, but many pharmacists are still concerned that introducing and maintaining one is difficult and time-consuming. 
<P>
'There is bound to be some time commitment in introducing such a system, but this one keeps that to an absolute minimum.'
<P>
Vantage launched its first CM2 system five years ago, based on data taken from hundreds of its pharmacists. The original system advised pharmacists what products should make up 70 per cent of their stock and they were told how to merchandise the brands. Seasonal products and those tailored to suit a particular region made up the remaining 30 per cent. 
<P>
CM2 was enhanced to CM2-Plus three years ago.

<H3><B>Scholl to sell its non-core firms</B></H3>
<P>

Scholl is selling a number of subsidiaries and brands to concentrate on its core foot products. Gerard House, which produces herbal remedies, will be sold. In France, the company will reportedly sell Valdor, a cosmetics company and Septivon, an antiseptic firm. All Scholl's shops in Italy, Germany and Switzerland are to close. 
<P>
The company is streamlining its five European strategic business units into two regions: northern and southern Europe, which will be managed out of Luton and Milan respectively. Its headquarters is being moved from Windsor to Luton. The company has set aside 29.4 million post-tax, charged against its half-year results, to finance the restructuring. 
<P>
Pre-tax profits rose 17 per cent to 13.8m  for the half year to June.

<H3><B>Boots to launch French skin care brands in the UK</B></H3>
<P>

The Boots Company will introduce some of France's leading anti-acne and anti-ageing products into the UK following its acquisition of Laboratoires Lutsia, said to be the French market leader for these products. Boots must decide whether to distribute the products - Lutsine anti-acne and Onagrine anti-ageing - through its pharmacy chain or through Crookes Healthcare, its sister company. 
<P>
If the brands are sold through Boots the Chemists, they will probably be restricted to the chain under an exclusive deal. Distribution under Crookes, however, would give other pharmacists a chance to stock them. Boots is unlikely to decide about the brands for a few months. The company may also introduce Lutsia's brands in Spain, Italy, and in the central and eastern European markets. 
<P>
For the moment, it is 'digesting' Lutsia, which it acquired from Roussel Aclaf - another skin care specialist - for Ff920 million (115m). Lutsia has more than 200 employees, including 70 at a plant at Chac&eacute;, in the Loire valley. Last year, the company's sales rose 11 per cent to Ff315m (39.4m).
<P>
The acquisition is in line with the company's strategy of building businesses in key European markets for its core products: analgesics (Nurofen), cough/throat (Strepsils) and skin care (E45, Lutsine and Onagrine). Boots says Lutsia will give Boots Healthcare International total sales in France of Ff460m (57.5m), close to those of Crookes. 
<P>
The acquisition is also expected to sharpen Boots' focus. Analgesics, cough/throat and skin care products now account for more than 60 per cent of BHI's sales and its skin care sales are expected to rise to 75m in a full year.  Meanwhile, Boots will use Lutsia's sales force to develop selected BHI brands, such as Nobacter, Solubacter and E45. BHI's 80-strong sales force in France will continue to focus on developing Nurofen and Strepsils, although the salesmen will work closely with those of Lutsia. Lutsia's head office staff in Paris will move to Boots Healthcare France's headquarters nearby.
<P>

<LI>Nurofen is to be advertised on television for the first time in France. The campaign is due to start within the next month.

<H3><B>3000 pharmacies could go if RPM is lost...</B></H3>
<P>
Over 3,000 community pharmacies could face closure if Resale Price Maintenance is lost, reveals a report commissioned by the Community Pharmacy Action Group.
<P>
''Our concern,'' says CPAG spokesperson and director of the National Pharmaceutical Association Tim Astill, ''is that the removal of RPM would force the closure of many small pharmacies and reduce the services provided by others, resulting in a threat to public healthcare.''
<P>
The 'In defence of community pharmacy' study by management consultant Deloitte & Touche shows that the public would have access to fewer pharmacies and would be forced to travel further to get pharmaceutical advice, with the proportions of vulnerable groups, such as the elderly and those with young families, higher in the areas most at risk. There would also be a reduced range of over the counter medicines available and job losses would be incurred.
<P>
The Office of Fair Trading last investigated RPM in 1970 and is to decide by the autumn if there is any material change that would allow its demise. The report divulges that there is change, but it strengthens the case for RPM retention, as pharmacists are now more reliant on branded medicines.
<P>
In 1970, the average small pharmacy derived 7 per cent of turnover from medicine sales and 40 per cent from NHS dispensing, with the margins on the latter at around 26 per cent. Now NHS dispensing accounts for 70 per cent of turnover, with margins down to 16 per cent, while OTCs are responsible for 15-16 per cent of turnover, around 45 per cent of the profit  The upshot of losing RPM would be a saving of 180 million, plus another 100,000 saved in policing.
<P>
''Without RPM,'' says Mr Astill, ''there might be a short-term gain, but there will certainly be a long-term loss.'' And 91 per cent of pharmacists surveyed by Glaxo Wellcome believe their business viability will be threatened. 
<P>
Supermarket chain Asda, at the forefront of the fight to abolish RPM, comments: ''We are well aware of the services that community pharmacies deliver to the local community, but we do not believe that RPM supports local pharmacies.'' Asda says that GPs and nurses back its stance on RPM. In an Asda mailing to 30,000 GPs, some 7,500 replies agreed that RPM results in artificially high prices for ''common healthcare products''. Only 40 replies disagreed. 
<P>
But backing for RPM comes from an even more powerful source, the Patients' Association. ''With RPM loss there will be a trade-off,'' says chief executive Guy Howland. ''Lowering prices will undoubtedly cause some existing pharmacies to close and reduce choice. The public like the access they currently get from pharmacies and we need to keep that available.'' The OFT has been sent a copy of the Deloitte & Touche report.

<H3><B>...survey reveals the threats</B></H3>
<P>
Ninety-one per cent of pharmacists believe their businesses would be threatened by the removal of Resale Price Maintenance, according to a Glaxo Wellcome survey. Eighty-eight per cent also feel threatened by changes in Government remuneration. Dispensing doctors, meanwhile, are regarded as potentially harmful by 81 per cent of the pharmacists. Slightly lower down the scale of threats are wholesaler-owned outlets, which alarm 75 per cent. 
<P>
However, most of the pharmacists are keen to fight on. Sixty per cent say they are not seriously considering getting out of retail pharmacy, 24 per cent appear to be giving the notion some thought, and 14 per cent are seriously considering quitting. On another positive note, 65 per cent intend to expand their businesses by adopting new services, such as consultancies 'in situ'.  
<P>
The increasing power of general practitioner fundholders brought mixed reactions. While 48 per cent of the pharmacists say the trend is a threat, 22 per cent see it as an opportunity. Forty per cent believe patient pack dispensing is an opportunity for their business, as opposed to 20 per cent who see it as a threat.
<P>
The development of primary care teams is considered good by 60 per cent of the pharmacists, while 48 per cent see the nurse prescribing pilot as an opportunity for their businesses. Glaxo sent out more than 8,000 questionnaires to community pharmacists around the UK in April. 
<P>
The company says it will use the information as a base to build a better relationship with them. The questions ranged from the respondent's purchasing responsibility to general attitudes towards key issues. Glaxo says the response was excellent. Those who completed the questionnaire were eligible to win a laptop computer, software and modem worth 3,000. Ian Millar, of Glasgow was the winner.

<H3><B>Pharmacists to be more clinical with methadone?</B></H3>
<P>
Pharmacists' potential to adopt a more clinical role in managing methadone patients is to be investigated by South Humberside's pharmacist-run Freelance Needle Exchange. Community pharmacist Dr Rod Tucker, director of the Freelance Group and devisor of the study, says: ''The overall objective of the project is to determine whether or not pharmacists can play a greater role in the clinical management of opiate-dependent individuals.''
<P>
South Humber Health Authority is paying 1 per addict per day for pharmacists to supervise the methadone consumption of 30 patients over 13 weeks, plus an additional 750 for evaluation. A clinical audit sheet will be maintained and clients will be assessed using an opiate withdrawal scale to titrate the methadone dose. An initial three-day assessment by the referral agency scores various signs and symptoms, such as sweating, agitation and mydriasis, to establish the degree of withdrawal. The dose is titrated upwards until symptoms are under control.
<P>
Thereafter, the pharmacist continues daily monitoring of the patient using the same scale. A change in the patient's drug-taking habit, such as taking additional opiates, can also be indicated by changes in routine or behaviour.  Every fortnight during the project, the withdrawal scales are scored and given to the prescribing agency responsible for the overall management of the client.

<P>
MPs disappear from Westminster for their three-month summer break on July 26, with no sign of a long-awaited Pharmacy Group being established to promote the interests of the sector. Tory MP Sir Malcolm Thornton and Labour's Alan Keen said last year that they planned to set up a group to lobby on behalf of pharmacies and vowed to launch the body early this year. But Sir Malcolm admits he has dropped out because of a lack of time. ''Unfortunately, I ran up against the buffers,'' he says. Mr Keen's office says the group has yet to be set up, but insists that the MP for Feltham still intends it to go ahead.

<H3><B>Oxygen to be devolved on October 1</B></H3>
<P>
The Department of Health is to devolve oxygen services to local level by October 1. The Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee, which has opposed the move, will write to local pharmaceutical committees with a model for local negotiations as soon as it receives more detailed guidelines. 
<P>
The NHS Executive expects agreements with health authorities to be made by January 1, 1997. Contractors should carry on as before until they receive further advice from their LPCs. The number of oxygen head sets is to be reduced, but contractors who have to give up head sets will be paid compensation. PSNC warns that money is only available for this financial year.
<P>
<STRONG>Remuneration </STRONG>The DoH and PSNC are poised on the brink of a remuneration settlement for 1996/97. PSNC has been promised an offer before the end of the month, after it met with health minister Gerald Malone. This followed PSNC's rejection of the DoH's last offer of 3 per cent in May.
<P>
PSNC chairman Wally Dove says that the offer will not be put to contractors. Providing an agreement is reached, then PSNC will discuss the distribution of the global sum at its September meeting and the new structure should be in place by October 1.
<P>
<STRONG>Director </STRONG>The first advertisement for the new position of director will be placed this week in the PSNC News and pharmaceutical press.
<P>
<STRONG>MPs </STRONG>The PSNC wants to thank those pharmacists who wrote to their MPs to raise awareness of pharmacy remuneration. It also wants to encourage LPCs to continue inviting MPs to visit pharmacies, so that they get a better understanding of community pharmacy issues.
<P>
<STRONG>Primary care</STRONG> The DoH has indicated that the NHS Executive would welcome further position papers from PSNC on the health minister's paper 'Primary care: the future'. PSNC will place emphasis on the need for non-global sum money to be made available for local initiatives.
<P>
<STRONG>Pilot trials</STRONG> PSNC has been in discussion with the DoH over pilot trials in 1996/97. It is stressing that pharmacists should receive their share of any money saved in repeat dispensing pilots.
<P>
<STRONG>GP co-operatives</STRONG> PSNC is concerned that there has been no national approach by local medical councils to the pharmacy profession over the setting up of GP co-operatives to provide emergency out of hours medical services. PSNC secretary Stephen Axon is against health authorities extending existing pharmacy rota hours to beyond those of  surgeries.
<P>
<STRONG>NAHAT</STRONG> PSNC wants to create a dialogue with the National Association of Health Authorities and Trusts over developing pharmaceutical services. It is hoped that money other than the global sum will be made available for such services.
<P>
<STRONG>Conference</STRONG> The third conference organised jointly with the Royal Pharmaceutical Society and the Pharmaceutical Advisers Group will be held at the Metropole Hotel, Birmingham, on November 7. The theme will be 'Pharmacists as partners in healthcare'.
<P>
<STRONG>LPC Conference</STRONG> PSNC has received comments from 23 LPCs about the March conference. The Committee will be looking at making the working group sessions more interactive, and will be targeting MPs more for the dinner.

<H3><B>Patients back pharmacists</B></H3>
<P>
Pharmacists should be given an expanded role in the primary care arena, according to the Patients' Association. Guy Howland, PA chief executive, says the Association is in the process of writing a paper on the future of pharmacy, which will place pharmacists at the forefront of primary care. ''Our whole thrust is that we want to see a role switch from dispensing to undertaking consultations, advising, prescribing and supplementing the work of the doctor and nurse,'' says Mr Howland.
<P>
He believes that pharmacists' skills can be put to better use. ''If we do not utilise the skills in primary care more effectively, then primary care as we know it will not survive. Let's get pharmacists to solve the primary care crisis.'' He feels that there should be a re-think on training so that all health professionals share a core base, and pharmacists will be allowed to develop their diagnostic and prescribing skills.
<P>
The report is expected in October, but the PA is keen to collate pharmacist evidence on how progress can be made. Information should be sent to: The Patients' Association, 8 Guilford Street, London WC1N 1DT.

<P>
Co-op Health Care, the pharmacy chain operated by United Norwest Co-op, has acquired five pharmacies in the North Midlands and north west of England.  The chain, which now has 49 stores, plans to acquire at least another six by the end of the year and will again be looking in these two regions.
<P>
A spokesman for Co-op Health Care says the latest acquisitions are in line with its plans to expand in the North West. More stores also improve the chain's buying power, he adds.  
<P>
The chain has been strengthening its management team over the past year to cope with its expansion. Newcomers include a professional development manager to help with recruitment and to maintain professional standards, and an integration manager, whose brief is to aid new branches in assimilating into the organisation.

<H3><B>York pharmacist struck off for 5,000 NHS fraud</B></H3>
<P>

A York pharmacist who was jailed after defrauding the NHS of over 5,000 by inflating his drug bills was struck off the Pharmaceutical Register at a disciplinary hearing this week. Nicholas Leo Goldstein, the proprietor of Gillygate Pharmacy in York, was sentenced to six months' imprisonment at York Crown Court on January 12 after pleading guilty to four specimen charges representing a total of 70 offences of dishonestly obtaining money by deception.
<P>
Josselyn Hill, representing the Royal Pharmaceutical Society at this week's Statutory Committee hearing, said Mr Goldstein was the company director and superintendent pharmacist of the Gillygate Pharmacy. An investigation was launched when North Yorkshire Family Health Services Authority approached an RPSGB inspector with concerns about the cost to the NHS of drugs dispensed to registered addicts at the Gillygate Pharmacy. 
<P>
Society inspector David Slater discovered discrepancies in the pharmacy's Controlled Drugs Register. He told the Committee: ''We had far more ampoules endorsed [on prescription] than had ever been purchased.'' He explained that Mr Goldstein claimed to use 100mg ampoules on each occasion. In reality, he was using a home-made powder solution which was cheaper, but continued to charge the NHS the full proprietary price for ampoules. 
<P>
Mr Goldstein told the hearing: ''I bitterly regret what I have done. It has brought shame on me and the profession. It was an aberration at a time when there were many great pressures on me, personal and business.'' Announcing the decision to strike Mr Goldstein off the Register, Committee chairman Gary Flather QC said: ''We have a pharmacist running a business who over the course of 14 months on 70 occasions obtained money from the Pricing Authority which was more than he was entitled to. 
<P>
''What can be said in support of Mr Goldstein is the massive amount of public support he has received. We cannot remember anyone producing as many references as he has done.'' But Mr Flather said the Committee could reach no decision other than to strike him off. ''This is dishonesty, a breach of trust. It is a very serious matter. We cannot have pharmacists who act like this.''

The Department of Health may be pushing to get the so-called Clothier 'loophole' settled by the courts. A dispensing doctors' practice has ''had ministerial advice that the only way forward is to go to judicial review''. Dr Ian Greaves, one of four doctors in the dispensing practice in Gnosall, Staffordshire, says that the doctors have been advised to seek a judicial review against the opening of a pharmacy in the village. The doctors are still awaiting leave to proceed.

There was a net opening of 18 pharmacy premises in Great Britain in July, the largest number since December last year. There were 30 new openings and four restorations to the Register, with 16 deletions. This brings the number of registered premises to 12,236. This compares to the 1995 year end total of 12,224.
<P>
Superdrug saw the most activity of the pharmacy multiples, with a net total of ten new pharmacies. Tesco was next with a net of five new pharmacies. Over 900 newly-qualified pharmacists were also added to the Register in July.

<P>

A pharmacist who has had his shop window smashed 20 times by vandals has hit out at a council which refused to let him put up security shutters. Terence Mattock of Mattock's Chemist in Leicester was speaking following the latest incident at his shop, when vandals smashed windows.
<P>
''I have applied three times to Leicester City Council for roll-down security shutters, but have been refused each time,'' says Mr Mattock. Instead, he has been forced to fit a metal grille which has failed to deter vandals. Mr Mattock, who has run the shop for 36 years, adds: ''We've had our windows smashed and our shop broken into 20 times in the last three years. I feel the council is betraying us in not letting me protect my shop.
<P>
''We pay a lot of taxes to protect our property and nothing seems to be done. These grilles have cost me 1,500 and we've not had them two months and the window has been smashed. I am not despondent, but just resigned to the fact that this will happen from time to time.''
<P>
A City Council spokeswoman responds: ''We don't want to have a fortress-like city, a boarded-up, shuttered, dark, uninviting city centre so we have a policy not to permit their use.''

<H3><B>Fire destroys N Yorks family business</B></H3>
<P>

A North Yorkshire pharmacist is struggling to get his business back together after a fire destroyed his stockrooms, attic and roof. Flames were shooting through the roof only minutes after a striplight started a blaze at Goodall's Pharmacy in Kirkbymoorside. The shop was full of customers but no one was hurt.
<P>
 It was an unfortunate case of history repeating itself. George Goodall believes an earlier pharmacy on the site was destroyed by fire in the early 1820s. That business probably had its origins as a retail outlet for herbs grown at a nearby monastery in the 13th Century.
<P>
The present pharmacy dates back to 1823 and has been in the Goodall family since 1945. Mr Goodall had been careful to conserve the older parts of the business, which included a wattle and daub wall. Now he is having to cope with water damage.
<P>
''Fortunately most of the heat went upwards so there is very little damage from smoke,'' he said. He managed to re-open the shop within four days, helped by customers and neighbours. His biggest complaints are the lack of guidance from his insurers on how to comply with building safety regulations after a blaze and the fact that Yorkshire Water could not supply the fire brigade with water locally - it had to come from neighbouring towns.

<H3><B>Gehe confirms its acquisitions agenda</B></H3>
<P>

Gehe is determined to stick to its ambitious acquisition strategy, whether or not it takes over Lloyds Chemists. Dr Karl-Gerhard Eick, Gehe's finance director, says the group will still be looking for more outlets ''after a certain period'', even if it succeeds in its bid for Lloyds.
<P>
 ''If we don't get Lloyds, we'll still keep the [acquisition] strategy. We would still want to increase our shops significantly,'' says Dr Eick. Losing Lloyds will not limit its plans - they will just take longer to fulfil, he adds.
<P>
He admits that its acquisition programme has slowed down this year, mostly because of the drawn-out bid war for Lloyds. From January to June, this year, it bought 13 pharmacies and took out a lease on one. But it also sold eight outlets. Dr Eick says the group has a target of pharmacies it wants to buy, but it is keeping the figure confidential for commercial reasons. 
<P>
The company's strategy is coming under closer scrutiny because it is close to finalising its list of buyers for seven Lloyds' wholesale buyers. Dr Eick says its list will be ready ''in advance'' of the October 18 deadline, and some press reports suggest it will be ready within the next two weeks. 
<P>
Both Gehe and Unichem must find buyers for selected Lloyds' wholesale depots if they want the Department of Trade and Industry to consider their eligibility to re-bid.
<P>
Speculation now centres on how much Gehe would want to pay for Lloyds. Since the sale of the wholesaler's depots was imposed last month, the German company has hinted that Lloyds is not worth as much as it was earlier this year. Lloyds' profit warning last month may have strengthened Gehe's case, but the unknown factor is still how the companies will react when Lloyds is set before them, assuming both win the DTI's approval.

<H3><B>Novartis heads south</B></H3>
<P>

Novartis, the company to be formed by the merger of Ciba and Sandoz, has decided to concentrate all its pharmaceutical activities in south east England. All the relocations are expected to be completed within the next three years. Novartis UK's pharmaceutical headquarters will be at Sandoz's facility in Frimley, Surrey. New offices to help accommodate the extra staff will be built on land that Sandoz owns opposite the site. They are expected to be completed in about 18 months.
<P>
The Frimley-based Sandoz clinical development centre, which co-ordinates clinical trials, collects data and provides analyses, will move to Novartis at Horsham. That site will also expand its research and development division. Meanwhile, international project teams in the UK will be joined by the global respiratory therapeutic area now in Basle. But Novartis says it is too early to say where in southern England these specialists will be based. 
<P>
A new respiratory drug discovery unit will also be located in the South, where it will combine Novartis' international resources with the respiratory pharmaceutical development expertise al-ready in the UK.Novartis' combination chemistry expertise will be absorbed into the pharmaceutical business, transferring from Macclesfield to southern England. Its self-medication business will move to Horsham.
<P>
As the group will have over-capacity in various areas, including manufacturing and certain drug development fields, it has decided to close a plant at Horsforth in Yorkshire, and a drug safety testing unit in Cheshire.

<H3><B>NHS GPs in supermarket surgeries?</B></H3>
<P>

Supermarkets and pharmacy multiples have expressed interest in running combined GP surgeries and pharmacies when the NHS Primary Care Bill becomes law.
<P>
Unichem's retail director, Barry Andrews, said this week that the company would be ''very interested'' if the Bill enabled commercial organisations to run health centres employing GPs and other NHS contractors. He envisaged a system by which independent, non-fundholding GPs could get together under one roof. A nearby pharmacy could then relocate into the centre, together with chiropodists, dentists and other professionals.
<P>
''The scheme could apply to independent pharmacists who were Unichem customers, not just to Moss Chemists,'' he said. ''In fact, it is more likely to benefit the independents, as we have 5,000 independent customers compared with just 460 Moss branches.''
<P>
He thought the idea would be most suitable for inner city areas where there were few fundholders and several single-handed GPs who might wish to work independently from the same purpose-built premises, sharing personnel such as receptionists.

<H3><B>No decision on PSNC director</B></H3>
<P>

The Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee has shelved any decision on appointing a director, but will be reconsidering the matter early next year.
<P>
There has been growing concern that the Committee has so far failed to find a suitable candidate. It is understood the search, using a recruitment agency, may have cost PSNC in the region of 30,000, and that some 17 candidates have been considered.
<P>
PSNC chairman Wally Dove commented: '' It would be irresponsible for the Committee to appoint an inappropriate candidate. To do so could prove extremely costly.''

<P>

Contractors are being asked to pay an additional 9 per cent levy to the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee on top of the amount demanded in April.
<P>
Local pharmaceutical committees seem to have swallowed the mid-year demand after the reasons were set out by PSNC financial executive Godfrey Horridge in a letter sent to LPCs at the end of November.
<P>
The levy has been unchanged for the last six years, but expenditure to March 31, 1997, is predicted to be higher than originally budgeted.

<H3><B>Over-skilled and under-used - should pharmacists prescribe?</B></H3>
<P>

Allowing pharmacists to prescribe would be a better way to utilise an under-used resource in the health service, delegates at a seminar in London heard this week.
<P>
Alan Maynard, professor of economics at York University, and former director of the Centre of Health Economics, declared that pharmacists are ''over-skilled and under-used''. He asked: ''Why do we have pharmacists in such large numbers when we do not utilise their skills?''
<P>
There was positive support for the notion from delegates -  representatives from industry, large multiples, hospitals and health authorities. A more detailed report appears in Chemist &amp; Druggist magazine this week.

<H3><B>Society opposes chiropodists' move into POMs</B></H3>
<P>

The Royal Pharmaceutical Society will not support the Medicines Control Agency's proposals to increase the Prescription Only Medicines that chiropodists may administer, and to add POMs to the list of Pharmacy medicines that chiropodists can supply to patients from stock. 
<P>
The Society is to tell the MCA that further work is needed to provide proper safeguards, possibly including a requirement that pharmacies supply the medicines. The proposed supply of antibiotics was of particular concern because of possible resistance.Despite some concerns about specific products, it was felt a better mechanism might be for state registered chiropodists to prescribe particular items in the same way as nurse prescribers.

<H3><B>Court backs parallel trade for unpatented drugs</B></H3>
<P>

The pharmaceutical industry has lost its battle to stop cheap, unpatented drugs from Spain and Portugal entering other European Union countries.
<P>
In a surprise decision, the European Court of Justice overturned the preliminary advice of one of its advocate generals, who had argued that the precedent-setting case of Merck &amp; Co versus Stephar was ''flawed'' and should be reversed.
<P>
New cases were brought by Smithkline Beecham and Merck, which questioned whether the sale of a drug in a member country where it cannot be patented exhausted the patent rights in other states. The two complainants called for the reversal of the patent exhaustion rule.
<P>
However, the court ruled in favour of the defendants, two British pharmaceutical importers, Primecrown and Europharm, giving them the green light to bring in parallel imports from Spain and Portugal, where price controls and the absence of patents make drugs cheap.
<P>
The court ruling appears in more detail in Chemist &amp; Druggist this week.

<H3><B>Retail sales set for more growth in 1997</B></H3>
<P>

The budget decision to permanently exempt from VAT all professional services supplied by pharmacists will be welcomed by most practitioners, but last month's proposals will themselves do little to boost consumer demand. Instead, they provide the necessary gentle tightening of the economy needed to forestall a late 1980s-style inflationary spiral as consumer spending gathers pace in the months ahead. 
<P>
With 3.5 per cent economic growth officially forecast for next year, consumer spending is already set to accelerate, without further inducement from the chancellor. Demand will be driven by a combination of rising real income growth and continued recovery in the housing market, as well as a series of 'windfall' payouts from building society mergers during 1997.
<P>
Meanwhile, an upturn in consumer confidence was translated into a 1.8 per cent surge in spending during the quarter to a level 5.8 per cent higher than at the same time in 1995. October saw strong performance by most retailers, following slower volume growth in September. 
<P>
But the latest survey from the Confederation of British Industry indicates that retail chemists saw only a small increase in sales, after a substantial increase in September. A balance of 7 per cent reported stronger demand than 12 months before. Moreover, one in three expect that November sales will turn out to be lower than a year ago. 
<P>
The British Retail Consortium agrees that ''the lack of cold weather had an adverse effect on medicine sales'', but found that October was good for toiletries and ''excellent'' for cosmetics. 
<P> 
Meanwhile, shops and factories made big inroads into their stocks of unsold goods during the third quarter. Retailers cut their inventories by the largest amount since the fourth quarter of 1991, according to estimates by the Office for National Statistics, following several quarters of massive stock build-ups. 
<P>
The substantial reduction of last year's 'stock overhang' is reflected in increased factory output, although sales by chemicals manufacturers slipped by 0.1 per cent  in the third quarter of 1996. Production of pharmaceutical products, toiletries and cosmetics eased between the two latest quarters, but in both sectors output was some 3 per cent higher than a year earlier.
<P>
The CBI's autumn survey of pharmaceutical and consumer chemical manufacturers found strong increase in output and orders during the four months to October, but with a slowdown in the pace of growth forecast for the months ahead. This is expected to be accompanied by a strong increase in unit manufacturing costs but a slackening in factory gate prices. 
<P>
In the High Street, prices of chemists' goods are rising at an annual rate of 4.5 per cent, compared with an increase of 2.7 per cent in the rate of inflation overall.

The Department of Health has released details of proposals of changes to the selected list. The Advisory Committee on NHS Drugs has recommended that 60 products in seven therapeutic categories (listed in Chemist & Druggist) should no longer be prescribable under the NHS. 
<P>
This includes 37 preparations for skin disorders and 11 treatments for allergic disorders, as well as products for anaemia, drugs acting on the ear, antidiarrhoeals, hypnotics, and drugs for vaginal and vulval conditions.
<P>
The Advisory Committee on Borderline Substances has also recommended the removal of over 200 unlicensed products, which have not demonstrated a therapeutic value or have more economic alternatives. The Department says that most of these products are in any case food supplements intended by their manufacturers for over the counter purchase

<H3><B>D'Arcy appointed as NPA director</B></H3>
<P>

The National Pharmaceutical Association has acted swiftly to fill the void left by its late director, Tim Astill. Meeting on Tuesday this week, the NPA Board agreed unanimously that John D'Arcy, currently the deputy director, should head the organisation. 
<P>
Following a career in community pharmacy, Mr D'Arcy joined the NPA in 1990 as pharmacist administrator. In 1995, he was deputy director.
<P>
 NPA chairman Peter Jenkins says: ''John has all the qualities and commitment required to continue the outstanding work of Tim Astill. There is no doubt that he is the best person for the job.''

<H3><B>Rural GPs lose High Court challenge to Clothier loophole</B></H3>
<P>

Dispensing doctors have lost a High Court challenge to prevent  pharmacists using the 'Clothier loophole' to open premises near their surgeries. Judgment was given by Lord Justice Schiemann on Wednesday  after a two-day hearing last week.
<P>
 He ruled that health authorities were ''not obliged'' to consider the impact on GPs' revenue or the service they provide when deciding whether or not to grant leave for a pharmacy to open. All they had to do was decide whether pharmacies were necessary and desirable to the efficient dispensing of drugs in any given area, and the doctors' positions were irrelevant, he said.
<P>
The judge remarked that the complexity of the regulations had been increased by the ''prolonged horse trading'' between the professions over many years. But the wording of the 1977 Act was clear, and the doctors had no grounds for challenging decisions to allow  pharmacies to open near their surgeries. 
<P>
The GPs had their judicial review challenges dismissed. They were ordered to pay costs, but were given leave to appeal.

<H3><B>MCA seeks views</B></H3>
<P>

Pharmacy organisations are urging the Medicines Control Agency to restrict paracetamol to pharmacies, rather than limiting the pack sizes on general sale. All sales would then be supervised by a pharmacist and advice available on how to use the medicine safely and effectively, says the National Pharmaceutical Association.
<P>
The MCA is also seeking views on aspirin and ibuprofen. Full details in Chemist & Druggist.
<P>
The NPA has welcomed the MCA's decision to consider ways of restricting paracetamol sales to reduce suicide attempts. Chairman Peter Jenkins said,  ''Paracetamol is effective and safe if used correctly, but, because it is so freely available on supermarket shelves, people do not realise that it can be harmful if the dosage instructions are not followed to the letter.''

<P>
Prescription charges will increase by 15 pence (2.7 per cent) to 5.65 from April 1, 1997, announced the chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, in the budget on Tuesday. 
<P>
Royal Pharmaceutical Society  president Ian Caldwell criticised the Government's plans, saying that it would lead to an increase in the number of people on low incomes unable to afford medicines. He reiterated the Society's call for a complete review of the prescription charge system, which he described as ''anachronistic, inconsistent in its application, and widely perceived as unfair''.
<P>
A four-monthly prepayment certificate will increase from 28.50 to 29.30, and an annual certificate will increase from 78.40 to 80.50.

<H3><B>Is there funding available over the Horizon</B></H3>
<P>
Contractors attending the North & South Essex Local Pharmaceutical Committees' contractors conference in Ingatestone, Essex, last weekend were told that ''the profession is suffering from insufficient funding. Funding issues must be a top priority'', said South Essex LPC chairman Bharat Patel. In his opening address to over 100 pharmacists, he focused on the importance of new sources of funding.
<P>
The new director of the National Pharmaceutical Association, John D'Arcy, suggested that the New Horizon document had focused the profession on the need for change, and must be welcomed. ''As bodies leading the profession, we must resolve our differences to prevent divide and rule by the Government,'' he advised contractors.

<P>

Chancellor Kenneth Clarke has frozen next year's uniform business rates (UBR) in his last budget before next year's general election.Up to 1.5 million small businesses, he says, could annually save up to 130 as a result.
<P>
The concession that allows pharmacists' professional services, supplied through partnerships or limited companies, to be exempt from VAT will also become permanent at the beginning of next year.
<P>
Mr Clarke has reduced small business corporation tax by 1p to 23p in the pound, which is expected to benefit about 400,000 companies.
<P>
The Government's spending on the National Health Service is set to rise 2.9 per cent in real terms to 1.6 billion next year.Mr Clarke says the NHS will also get extra investment, worth more than 900m over the next three years, from the Government's private financing initiative. This involves deals between the private and public sector.
<P>
A more complete report with industry comment appears in Chemist & Druggist this week.

<H3><B>Primary care pharmacists help save GPs 150,000</B></H3>
<P>
Primary care pharmacists in Wales have helped save six GP practices over 150,000. The project, established in the Upper Rhonda Fawr, Mid-Glamorgan, in September, 1995, could be the ''embryogenesis of the future of pharmaceutical services in this country'', says project leader and Council member Andrew Burr. 
<P>
The project had a multi-strand approach to evaluating pharmacist impact on prescribing policies: the assignment of a primary care pharmacist to six of seven non-fundholding GP practices in the area; and ten of 11 community pharmacies in the area participating in a mediation intervention scheme.
<P>
The primary care pharmacist (PCP) developed individualised practice formularies and treatment guidelines for a range of diseases, while the community pharmacists identified non-formulary medication and suggested alternatives. The PCP ensured the inappropriate medication was either modified or discontinued, resulting in a combined saving of almost 1,000 per month for the six surgeries (C&D May 18, p681).
<P>
A further element of the study was the use of the community pharmacists in screening for Helicobacter pylori. Some 65 per cent of those tested were found to be infected and the use of ulcer-healing medication dropped. One practice reported a 30 per cent fall in costs after six months.
<P>
All the practices which had interventions made by the PCPs and community pharmacists came in under budget, from 1.2 per cent under to 11.7 per cent, a total saving of 153,262, while the one control pharmacy in the area scored 18.5 per cent over budget.

<H3><B>DoH proposes centralising script payment procedure</B></H3>
<P>
The Department of Health is proposing centralising the prescription payment procedure through the Prescription Pricing Authority, removing control of payment from the 105 new unitary authorities. The Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee is opposed to the move. 
<P>
However, chairman Wally Dove is amused at the message the new scheme is sending to contractors. ''It's interesting that they have done a U-turn, it seems to fly in the face of their quest for devolution.''
<P>
But PSNC secretary Stephen Axon warns that it may cause difficulty in implementing pharmacist devolution. ''This could act as a very clear obstacle to devolution as a central authority cannot operate 105 pay systems.'' 
<P>
Although the plan is still in the discussion stages, Mr Axon says the division that deals with the software for the system is no longer providing updates, indicating that the decision may already have been made. 
<P>
<STRONG>Remuneration </STRONG>PSNC met with health minister Gerald Malone and senior DoH officials on June 6. Mr Dove says the minister was made aware of the ''frustration, fear and anger'' felt by community pharmacists. ''We gained the distinct impression,'' says Mr Dove, ''that the minister and officials were keen to seek an acceptable resolution to this year's remuneration so we can put some of the old chestnuts behind us and look to the future.''

<H3><B>Safeway offers H pylori testing</B></H3>
<P>
Safeway has expanded its allergy testing pilot to include Helicobacter pylori detection. The six-month project will run through five of the company's in-store pharmacies with a trained nurse or pharmacist able to offer the result of the 12.99 Helisal test within five minutes.
<P>
Jill Bell, Safeway's professional development manager, says the aim is to promote the service to local GPs and have patients referred, although it will also be available to the general public. ''We are empowering people to have the information on H pylori so that if they do have the symptoms, they know they can do something about it,'' she says.
<P>
To determine suitability, a pre-test questionnaire will be used on patients with reflux or indigestion symptoms and will highlight those who have been on long-term antacids, who have been prescribed H2 antagonists or proton pump inhibitors, or who have ever been diagnosed as having a peptic ulcer.
<P>
Those who are negative for H pylori will be counselled on general health and dietary advice. For those who are positive, says Mike Smith of PMC, a diagnostic testing company which is running the service with Safeway, referral to the GP is necessary. Patients are given copies of the questionnaire, their answers and the test results to take to their GP. 
<P>
Since the service was launched two months ago, around 80 patients have been tested with 54 per cent revealed to be infected with H pylori.

<H3><B>OBEs for Astill and Jones</B></H3>
<P>
Pharmacists Tim Astill, director of the National Pharmaceutical Association, and Roger Jones, managing director of Penn Pharmaceuticals, have been appointed Officers of the Order of the British Empire. Mr Astill receives his award in this year's Birthday Honours List for services to the pharmaceutical profession. Mr Jones' is for services to industry in Wales. 
<P>
''Naturally, I am delighted with this award,'' says Mr Astill. ''It is a great honour, not only for myself and my family but for the NPA itself. It reflects the esteem in which the organisation is held nationally and is really a reward for the efforts and dedication of the whole of Mallinson House.''
<P>
Mr Astill joined the National Pharmaceutical Union in 1969 as personal assistant to the director. He was promoted from deputy director to director in 1981. Besides being a fellow of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society and the British Institute of Management, he is a liveryman of the Worshipful Society of Apothecaries and a freeman of the City of London. He is also active on other pharmacy-based committees.
<P>
Mr Jones founded Penn Pharmaceuticals in 1977, and the company now employs 128 people in Tredegar in Gwent. He is chairman of the Welsh Training and Enterprise Councils, of IOD Wales and the Welsh Medical Technology Forum. He also acts as a non-executive director of the Powys Healthcare Trust and is a member of the NHS Wales Research & Design Forum, a trustee of the Welsh Language Centre and a governor of the University of Wales. 
<P>
Also honoured is the chief executive officer of Zeneca Group, David Barnes CBE, who is knighted for services to the pharmaceutical industry. Sir David joined ICI in 1957, and moved to its board in 1983. He was appointed CEO of the Zeneca Group on its demerger from ICI in June, 1993.
<P>
<STRONG>Scottish Department Executive</STRONG> Glasgow community pharmacist Elizabeth Roddick has been elected chairman of the Scottish Department Executive. Her previous position of vice chairman has been filled by former Scottish Pharmaceutical General Council chairman Graham Millar, who chairs Edinburgh Sick Childrens' NHS Trust. The immediate past-president, David Bolton, failed to get re-elected to one of the Executive's six contested seats. George Allan (Edinburgh) and Ronald Shiels (Inverness) were both successfully re-elected. 
<P>
New faces on the Executive include Rose Marie Parr (Kincardine-on-Forth), director of the Scottish Centre for Post-qualification Pharmaceutical Education; Dr Norman Lannigan (West Calder); and David Thomson (Lenzie).

<H3><B>Numark bumps up member rebates</B></H3>
<P>
Numark shareholders received an average rebate of 158 per pharmacy (191 including interest) for the first quarter of 1996, a return of 132 per cent on the management fee. The total rebate for the first three months of 1996 was 142,262, compared to 23,370 for the same period last year. Numark was launched on February 1, 1995.
<P>
 The first quarter's results do not include a major OTC rebate which is made to shareholders at the end of the year. There was a healthy rebate from own-brand business, while the window display allowance proved a success, says the company. Growth has also been reflected in an increasing range of shareholder benefits.

<H3><B>Pattni wins against Farillon</B></H3>
<P>
A man who says he is owed almost 400,000 by a subsidiary of Lloyds Chemists has emerged victorious from London's High Court. Pradip Pattni, owner of Vital Health, had sued Essex-based distributor Farillon in respect of the sale of hundreds of thousands of pounds of his company's stock to another company within the Lloyds group.
<P>
Judge Michael Rich QC ruled that Farillon's transaction with Barclay Pharmaceuticals (Atherstone) had been a 'genuine' one. The judge's decision means Mr Pattni is entitled to his share of the sale proceeds.
<P>
In May, 1994, Farillon - distributor of Vital Health's Vitalia vitamins and food supplements - sold 659,000 of stock to Barclay. Mr Pattni claimed his part of the proceeds amounted to 392,786.62, but Farillon denied that the sale to Barclay had ever taken place. With Vital Health now in receivership, Mr Pattni has set up another similar, but smaller business, the Ideal Health Group.
<P>
 Malcolm Davis-White, for Mr Pattni, told the court: ''Farillon and Barclay Pharmaceuticals, over time, have given various explanations as to why there was no sale. These explanations do not convince, and support the view that there was a sale.'' Judge Rich ruled: ''There is no issue that on May 31, 1994, Farillon invoiced goods to Barclay at the relevant price, of approximately 659,000.
<P>
''At the moment when the transaction was recorded, if it was - as I find - a genuine transaction, then it was a sale at the price which had been recorded, creating the liabilities in Farillon to Vital Health.'' A 'binding agreement' had been reached between Farillon and Barclay, said the judge.
<P>
VAT issues have yet to be resolved, and the precise amount of money now due to Mr Pattni has yet to be finalised. Speaking after the case, Mr Pattni said: ''I may have won in Court, but taking everything into account, Lloyds did not lose in financial terms, whereas some of my losses are not remediable or quantifiable.''

<H3><B>Welcome news from Glaxo</B></H3>
<P>
Glaxo Wellcome will be presenting pharmaceutical wholesalers with new proposals on the format of the company's agency scheme on June 25. Talks have been taking place between the British Association of Pharmaceutical Wholesalers and the company for some time.
<P>
Chairman David Linney, speaking at the Association's annual meeting earlier this month, said Glaxo Wellcome's decision to involve the BAPW ''will go a long way to removing the strained relationship which has existed during the past five years''.
<P>
The other major area exercising wholesalers is the introduction of patient packs, said Mr Linney, where the original schedule is now two months adrift. He reiterated his call for a period of margin stability to allow wholesalers to overcome the ''extra volume, same value'' scenario presented by patient packs. Cost savings would be necessary, and this meant greater automation.
<P>
''Automation is an expensive capital investment,'' said Mr Linney, and urged manufacturers to take away the message that the 12.5 per cent margin allowed under the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme is essential.

<H3><B>Welsh pharmacist intervention trial success</B></H3>
<P>
A pharmacist prescribing intervention trial is showing significant savings can be made in doctors' drug spending.
<P>
The results indicate annual savings of almost 12,000 can be made by the ten participating pharmacies for the six GP practices in the trial each year.
<P>
The three-week trial last autumn in the Upper Rhondda Fawr in Mid-Glamorgan (C&D September 16, 1995, p379) saw pharmacists reporting 412 cost-saving interventions to GPs using a signed card system. 
<P>
GPs agreed with 98 per cent of the recommended interventions, such as generic and continuity prescribing. Maintenance interventions, such as adjusted dose, also contributed to the savings.
<P>
All six practices showed a decrease in their projected budget for this fiscal year. The one control practice, where no such interventions were made, showed a significant increase.
<P>
Andrew Burr, of the Welsh Prescribing Support Centre, says the data is very interesting. "It shows community pharmacy can have a major impact on prescribing. The data is of key value for negotiations for the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee."

<H3><B>Nurses set to prescribe more</B></H3>
<P>
It is likely that nurses will be allowed to prescribe more medicines on the NHS. The Department of Health's chief nursing officer, Yvonne Moores, said last week that the expert group which decides on the medicines to be included in the nurses' formulary has been reconvened to consider possible changes.
<P>
"Certainly there will be some additions," she told a medical journalists' briefing. "There won't be a sudden doubling [of products], but the formulary will be built up, step by step, in the light of experience."
<P>
The final report on the one-year pilot study on nurse prescribing is expected soon. Ms Moores said the experiment had already shown benefits to patients - who had had quicker and easier access to medicines - and to nurses in terms of professional accountability. On cost benefits, the data were "telling us that nurses were very good indeed at thinking carefully about prescribing," she said.
<P>
The project was extended for a year from April 1 to 150 trained district nurses and health visitors. Again, there would be much data collection and evaluation, she said: "I must say that I'm very optimistic. It's been a huge responsibility for the nurses involved and they know it."

A booklet launched this week gives parents information on  how to talk to their children about drug misuse.
<P>
The booklet, 'A parents' guide to drugs and solvents', gives information on the drugs likely to be misused, how to tell if children are using them and where to get help.
<P>
Published by the Health Education Authority and the National Drugs Helpline, copies are available on the drugs literature line 0800 987999. After June 10, pharmacists will be able to get bulk supplies from Solo Communications on 01304 614731.
<P>
The Government is contributing a further 2 million to boost local efforts against drug misuse. The money will go to a new Challenge Fund, enabling drug action teams to bid for funding for projects that will help tackle drug abuse at a local level. The teams will be encouraged to form partnerships with the private sector.

Over 100 drug action teams have been set up in England to implement the Government's 'Tackling drugs together' strategy launched a year ago. The groups bring together the voluntary sector, police, schools and local education authorities.

<H3><B>GPs talk on primary team tactics</B></H3>
<P>
GPs recognise the role of pharmacists in the primary healthcare team, but blame geography on the lack of full integration within that team.
<P>
Speaking at a seminar organised by the National Pharmaceutical Association at last week's General Practice Conference, television celebrity and columnist Dr Mark Porter said one of the reasons why pharmacists were not fully integrated members of the primary healthcare team was their geographical distance from the surgeries.
<P>
Ways to overcome this geographical barrier were discussed, together with areas where pharmacists can work closely with surgery staff. Lyn Longridge, practice manager of a large fundholding practice in Tewkesbury, believed these areas would include prescription collection and delivery services; PACT analysis; formulary development; home visits and brown bag schemes. 
<P>
The panel also included two pharmacists who talked about their own experiences of working with their local GP practice. Peter Marshall, deputy chairman of Numark and with a pharmacy in Skipton, said liaison led to significant cost savings, as well as job satisfaction.

<H3><B>Superstore pharmacies coming to Northern Ireland?</B></H3>
<P>
The supermarket pharmacy-free status of Northern Ireland may be ended when Sainsbury opens its first stores there.
<P>
Two stores will be opening in Ballymena and Coleraine before Christmas, and Sainsbury is hoping to include pharmacies in each, subject to the stores being granted licences. It is thought a pharmacy will relocate to the site of a third store, set to open next spring in Newtown Breda, south Belfast.
<P>
Northern Ireland does not yet have any of the large supermarkets that are a feature in the rest of the UK. In his address to the Ulster Chemists' Association, Barry Andrews, managing director of Moss Chemists, warned of the problems faced by independents on the mainland (see below).
<P>
Tesco says it has no plans to open pharmacies in any of its planned Northern Ireland stores. The first of three is expected to open in the autumn.

<H3><B>Positive outlook for pharmacy retailing</B></H3>
<P>
The UK is not alone in facing the problems of rising productivity in pharmacy coupled with reduced remuneration.
<P>
However, the message aimed at pharmacists attending the Ulster Chemists' Association conference in Newcastle, co Down, last Sunday, was to consider what they can do individually and collectively which will allow the profession to enter the next century with a positive outlook.
<P>
"We must not allow those who do not wish to change to stand in the way of those who do," said Barry Andrews, managing director of Moss Chemists, in his keynote address.
<P>
Warning of the impact of large supermarkets (see previous story), which have yet to open in Northern Ireland, he said: "You ain't seen nothing yet! Sales of traditional pharmacy business lines are moving over to grocers at a rate of 4 per cent per annum."
<P>
He saw three possible ways forward for pharmacy in the future:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>'managed decline', which accepts declining margins with static income in real terms and no investment
<LI>'smarter and sharper', where existing business is driven even harder
<LI>'developing business', where by undertaking new services new income streams can be obtained.
</UL>
<P>
Pharmacists could increase sales by making the shop more inviting or offering incentives, such as a mother and baby discount card.
<P>
"Do you micromarket?" he asked. "Do you stock the precise ranges and products that people really want to buy - not what you want to sell them?"
<P>
"Well trained counter staff will generate at least an extra 5,000 per year of sales per assistant compared to those who are untrained," he said.
<P>
Mr Andrews warned that products may be being sold too cheaply. He advised: "Don't compete on price unnecessarily - you are only giving your hard-earned margin away."
<P>
Pharmacists could develop their business by undertaking new services, he felt. "You have to find new ways to add value to the healthcare chain and find ideas to move significantly beyond the traditional role and function of a pharmacy - but preferably in ways that competing people or bodies cannot.
<P>
"A more strategic suggestion is to gradually redefine the pharmacist's role as the nation's medicine manager," he continued. "Surely, with our expertise and working with the GPs, we can save at least 2 per cent or 22 per cent on the cost of drugs. Splitting these savings would be a pretty good income generator. The phrase 'fundholding pharmacy' comes to mind.
<P>
"Medicine management should be attractive to a considerable number of community pharmacists. With some training, they will have the ability and confidence to offer this service to individual GP practices or health boards.
<P>
"Customers like patronising those pharmacies that do provide extra professional services. They probably expect us to be undertaking many of these new roles and we are simply fulfilling their expectations - a critical success factor if ever there was one."
<P>
Pharmacists were also encouraged to discuss mutual problems more frequently with each other to motivate and learn by collective experiences. 
<P>
"I am convinced that this isolation is often the root cause of our hesitation to progress and our apparent apathy. Overcome that and pharmacy 2000 looks very attractive," concluded Moss' managing director.

<H3><B>Town centre management needs greater support</B></H3>
<P>
Retailers do better in towns where local authorities and businesses are working together to promote the town centre, a national survey of principal High Street retailers commissioned by Boots the Chemists has confirmed. But only three out of 17 town centre management (TCM) schemes surveyed had half of local businesses signed up and many had less than 20 per cent of traders supporting them.
<P>
Urban Management Initiatives of Huddersfield, which conducted the survey, believes that the effect of out of town development on High Street shopping appears to be more marked than previously estimated, particularly in the South East. A number of TCM schemes have, however, had success in minimising the effect of such developments and in re-invigorating town centres. 
<P>
John Lockwood, of Urban Management Initiatives, tells C&D that commitment to TCM schemes is unlikely to be expensive for smaller traders. Small independents ought to be saying "What is our policy?" and "What are we going to do to strengthen our town?", he suggests.
<P>
Information was provided by 22 principal retailers, with detailed input from Boots and Marks & Spencer. In all, 323 stores in 46 towns - 17 of which had had town centre management schemes operating for at least two years - provided input.
<P>
In towns with an effective TCM scheme, 71 per cent of stores achieved higher takings than stores in control towns. TCM centres which performed best gave priority to, and reported no significant problems with, access and parking. However, taking the 46 centres as a whole, store managers reported that takings in one-third were being damaged by access problems, parking charges and by access controls. 
<P>
The effectiveness of many schemes was limited by lack of sign-up and commitment from local businesses. Lack of funding meant that issues such as access, and ease and cost of parking were not being addressed.

<H3><B>Unichem takeover to focus Lloyds on healthcare - but name goes</B></H3>
<P>
Last week, Unichem offered 547 million in cash and shares for Lloyds Chemists, which includes 924 retail pharmacies around the UK, the Daniels' wholesaling business, 369 Holland & Barrett healthfood stores and a number of smaller divisions.
<P>
"People think it's a natural move because it rebalances both groups. I think we're producing one of Europe's strongest healthcare companies," says Unichem chief executive Jeff Harris. 
<P>
 The combined companies will have an annual turnover of around 2.5-1.37 billion from the wholesaling operations; 670m from the retail arm; and 430 from related businesses.
<P>
The deal will make Unichem the largest retail pharmacy chain in the UK, with almost 1,350 pharmacies. Rationalisation and scale benefits could mean savings of up to 20m per year. However, the Office of Fair Trading could be concerned that the move will also give Unichem around 40 per cent of the UK wholesaling market. Unichem anticipates disposing of two depots and closing three to satisfy the OFT, but stresses that this will not prejudice its wholesaling service.
<P>
Mr Harris has a number of plans for Lloyds if the deal goes through: "The aim is to keep the group together." However, Unichem will sell the 185 Supersave drugstores because "we don't think they have a future". 
<P>
There is very little geographical overlap between the Lloyds' chain and Moss pharmacies, according to Mr Harris. "There are probably fewer than 50 shops that we're thinking of divesting, either because they don't fit into the trading image we want to put forward, or they are the wrong size, or there is too much overlap in the territory."

<H5>Lloyds' name to go</H5>

All Lloyds' pharmacies will be rebranded as Moss stores and Mr Harris wants to put the emphasis "fair and square" back onto pharmacy services. "I want to take Lloyds away from the toiletries business back to being a healthcare business," he says.
<P>
Unichem aims to undertake a major retraining of staff to reflect the switch in emphasis to healthcare and to ensure that the best possible advice is given to customers, elaborates Moss retail director Barry Andrews. He hopes that the name change and retraining of staff will be completed by the end of 1996.
<P>
Mr Andrews says that if the deal goes through, Unichem will negotiate with the National Pharmaceutical Association to bring Lloyds' pharmacies back into the organisation, because he believes that such a move will strengthen the community pharmacy sector and "community pharmacy is what Moss is all about". He also says that the relationships at LPC level are likely to be more positive.
<P>
Mr Harris believes that the size of the retail chain will also give the company "a great chance to create an own-label" - an own-label in OTC medicines, not in toiletries -  which will be supported by independents as well as the Moss chain.
<P>
Mr Harris is also eager to expand the service offered by Daniels Enterprise. "We would wish to offer both services; our own [Unichem] daily services at the sort of pricing structures that we and others are offering in the marketplace today, and alongside that we want to roll-out the weekly Daniels' service nationwide at the keener prices it can offer because of its lower distribution costs."
<P>
Unichem is also considering splitting its delivery systems. "I believe we must protect the independent customers from the disruption to deliveries, timing and routes from having 900 Lloyds' shops, so we may end up with a separate van delivery for Moss, maybe once a day, maybe less frequently, which should enable us to protect the independent service."
<P>
The offer document was due out in the middle of this week and the offer closes 21 days after its publication, unless another bidder appears.
<P>
Rumours suggest that Gehe, the German wholesaler, which bought AAH last year, may be considering an offer. John Richards, retail analyst at Natwest, says that because Gehe has a similar business mix to Unichem in the UK it would realise the same benefits from a Lloyds' takeover. He says that a bid from Gehe is "possible", but suggests that the company would think about the situation rather than rush in.
<P>
Michael Ward, Lloyds' chief executive, was unable to comment on rumours of a second bidder. Mr Harris says he would be "a little surprised that a German wholesaler would want to invest quite so substantially in the UK retail market".
<P>
Unichem is offering 232p in cash plus four new Unichem ordinary shares for every three Lloyds' ordinary shares, which values Lloyds' ordinary shares at 396p. The preference offer will be 49.89p in cash plus 0.8603 new Unichem ordinary shares for each Lloyds' preference share. The directors of Lloyds have recommended that shareholders accept the Unichem offer. The deal will make around 50m for the Lloyds' family, which owns around 10 per cent of the share capital of the company. 
<P>
Allen Lloyd, the company's chairman, will stand down after the deal goes through. Michael Ward will join the Unichem board as commercial director and Timothy Brookes, a non-executive director of Lloyds, will join as a non-executive director. "Other directors will not be working for [Unichem] long-term," says Mr Harris.

<H3><B>Malone seeks way ahead for primary care</B></H3>
<P>
Health ministers are consulting with professional bodies on how they see the way ahead for primary care.
<P>
"We have an initiative under way to find where we go now," health minister Gerald Malone told an OTC marketing seminar in London on Monday. "We have seen rapid progress towards the slogan of a primary care-led health service ... we want to hear the breadth of ideas that all professions have.
<P>
"What should the primary care team be? Should we be doing what we can to break down professional barriers? If we are going to look upon community pharmacists as more important, how will they work with GPs? Can people be encouraged to move into a different healthcare setting?" Mr Malone asked.
<P>
He cast doubt on last month's Which? report into the quality of pharmacists' OTC advice. "I am not sure that the report is a robust and comprehensive picture of what is happening in pharmacy today. My own experience is that you get questioned fairly rigorously."
<P>
The DoH supports the Royal Pharmaceutical Society's protocols initiative for medicine sales. People should not expect it to be instantly effective, he cautioned. "It is rather unfortunate that the valuable initiative researched in the Which? report has not yet had the chance to develop."
<P>
Recent changes to pharmacy contractors' pay structure had focused more on professional activities. "We very much look to community pharmacy in the context of where the public can learn more about health matters. Their footsteps lead them to the pharmacy much more often than to the GP," said Mr Malone.
<P>
There should be a move "where possible" to OTC medicines, he said. "If moving products OTC takes pressure off the NHS that is a happy, but not prejudged outcome."
<P>
Professor Alan Maynard, secretary of the Nuffield Provincial Hospitals Trust, commented that pharmacists are an underused and undervalued resource in the community. Barry Clare, managing director of Boots Healthcare International, said that pharmacists in the UK were much more willing partners of the OTC industry than elsewhere in the EC.
<P>
Many manufacturer representatives complained of the regulatory hurdles which have to be overcome in launching and promoting  OTC products in other European countries.
<P>
The inconsistencies of rules and regulations across the EC is nothing to do with health but more to do with protectionism, said Mr Clare. If the market was allowed to remain confused, then the UK industry would not emerge as a major worldwide OTC player, he warned.
<P>
There were suggestions that the OTC industry is running out of steam in trying to crack the European market, and that it was time the industry challenged the current decentralised procedure. 
<P>
The PAGB's director, Sheila Kelly, argued that if companies wanted to develop a brand in more than one market, then the framework to do so existed. The transitional period comes to an end in 1998, after which time people will have to use the European framework.

<H3><B>SB sets up science-based  pharmacy sales team</B></H3>
<P>
Smithkline Beecham is setting up a new pharmacy sales team in order to meet the changing needs of pharmacists.
<P>
It will be made up of representatives with science-based qualifications and will replace the existing pharmacy sales team. The 32 representatives, the same number as the current team, will be in place by the beginning of April, this year.
<P>
SB says research has revealed pharmacists want more from representatives than just advice on SB products.
<P>
A company spokesman says that scientifically-qualified professionals would be "on the same wavelength" as pharmacists. The aim is to create "a genuine partnership" that will benefit both sides. SB believes that all companies will eventually modify their sales forces to create better relationships with pharmacists.
<P>
The representatives will be trained in key therapeutic areas. They will implement therapy area-driven protocols and advise on category management and merchandising.

<H3><B>'Two pharmacies more desirable than one'</B></H3>
<P>
A Lincoln pharmacy's battle to stop a rival from opening up just 50 metres away and threatening its business ended in failure last Thursday in London's Appeal Court.
<P>
P J Norton insists that the dispensing service it provides from its outlet in the 1,400-patient Birchwood Health Centre is adequate to serve the local population's needs. 
<P>
The company was furious when competitor, Lincoln Co-operative Chemists was given permission to open up a rival branch inside a new extension to the health centre by Lincolnshire Family Health Services Authority in April, 1994.
<P>
But Lord Justice Butler-Sloss, sitting with Lord Justice Waite and Lord Justice Morritt, ruled in the Appeal Court last week that P J Norton had no arguable grounds for complaint.
<P>
The company appealed against the decision, but had its case dismissed by the FHS Appeal Unit in November, 1994. 
<P>
Jonathan Fisher, for P J Norton, had attacked the Appeal Unit's decision as "irrational". There had never been any complaints about the adequacy of the service provided by the health centre's existing pharmacy.
<P>
But the Appeal judge said the Appeal Unit was entitled to its view that, in an area of fast-growing population, two pharmacies were more "desirable" than one.

<H3><B>Winter of content for cold remedies manufacturers, IMS reports</B></H3>
<P>
The 1995 OTC winter cold remedies market witnessed a 2 per cent sales increase through pharmacy compared to 1994. This was up on the static performance seen for the previous year.
<P>
There are five major segments within this sector accounting for the following shares: 
<P>
Cough 37%;   Cold/Flu 23%;   Sore throat 18%;   Nasal decongestants 16%;   Decongestants/Rubs 6%
<P>
Looking at these in closer detail, we can see the three leading products within each are as shown below:
<P>
Cough: 1 Benylin;  2 Covonia;  3 Meltus
<P>
Cold/Flu: 1 Night Nurse; 2 Lemsip; 3 Beechams Powders
<P>
Sore Throat: 1 Strepsils; 2 Ultra Chloraseptic; 3 Merocaine
<P>
Nasal Decongestants: 1 Sudafed; 2 Otrivine; 3 Sinutab
<P>
Decongestants/Rubs: 1 Vicks; 2 Olbas; 3 Wrights
<P>
Viewing the market as a whole, Warner Wellcome is by far the number one player, taking a 27 per cent share. It is followed in second place by Smithkline Beecham Consumer Healthcare, which takes 14 per cent and in third place is Crookes with 9 per cent. These three leading companies have maintained their positions over the last three years.
<P>
So which are the top dogs in each of the segments?
<P>
The number one manufacturer in the cough market is Warner Wellcome, which takes almost half of the sector with the Benylin, Sudafed and Actifed ranges. 
<P>
Cold/flu sees Smithkline Beecham Consumer Healthcare up front with a 50 per cent share. This is driven in the main by Night Nurse, Beechams Powders and Day Nurse. Warner Wellcome occupies the number two spot.
<P>
Crookes dominates sore throat remedies, primarily with Strepsils and Dequacaine.
<P>
Warner Wellcome features again as the number when looking at the nasal decongestants market, where Sudafed and Sinutab take the lion's share.
<P>
The smallest sector, decongestants/rubs, is headed by Procter & Gamble with Vicks.

<h3>Medihealth bids for Lloyds' depots</h3>
<P>
Medihealth, the short-line wholesaler, has placed a bid for all the Lloyds' wholesale depots that Unichem and Gehe are seeking to sell.
<p>
The depots are at Cambridge, Carlisle, Coulsdon, Derby, Glasgow, York and Belfast.
<p>
Medihealth would not discuss the value of its bid, but C&D understands that the company does not believe the depots are worth much. Lloyds' business would probably be more valuable without the depots, according to one source. 
<p>
The wholesaler's move should not surprise those who have been following its activity. Mike Retter, Medihealth's chief executive, has said that his company wants to become a major player in the UK market. Unlike most short-line wholesalers, Medihealth already operates nationally, with its own sales force. It claims to have 3,000 pharmacy customers and is seeking to cover all 9,127 independents (C&D July 27, p126).
<p>
<li>
The Department of Trade and Industry this week dismissed a press report that claimed it had told Lloyds Chemists' prospective bidders, Unichem and Gehe, that it would take at least three weeks to decide whether it was satisfied with a list of depot buyers it had apparently received from Lloyds.
<p>
A DTI spokesperson says it always aims to make a decision about prospective bidders as soon as possible: 

"We do not like to keep them waiting on tenterhooks, but we would never tell them when to expect an announcement."

<h3>Yellow cards for pharmacists and  OTCs?</h3>
<P>
The Medicines Control Agency is soon to consult pharmacists on how they should be involved in the reporting of adverse drug reactions.
<p>
The Royal Pharmaceutical Society has been discussing with the MCA ways in which pharmacists could report adverse reactions to both prescription and non-prescription medicines. A national scheme for hospital pharmacists is to be set up and, within the next couple of months, the MCA is to issue a consultative document giving ideas for community pharmacist involvement.
<p>
Roger Odd, the Society's head of practice, told a Chemex forum on Monday that one option might be for community pharmacists to report directly via the yellow card system. He said the Society would like to see schemes in place as soon as possible after the MCA's consultation process. But it could take some time to train pharmacists and to agree on the right protocols for obtaining and reporting the information. Hospital pharmacists were already being trained for this function.
<p>
Mr Odd believed pharmacist involvement was long overdue. The present system required adverse reaction reports to go through doctors, but pharmacists were in a much better position to report reactions to non-prescription medicines as GPs were often unaware that patients had taken them.
<p>
It would, however, be important to set up links with GPs as pharmacists would need to be aware of patient profiles. Preliminary discussions with the British Medical Association suggested that doctors would be happy for pharmacists to report ADRs, providing doctors had a part in the consultation process.
<p>
The forum was organised jointly by Chemist & Druggist and Roche Consumer Health.

<h3>RPM petition presented</h3>
<P>
A petition of 30,000 signatures supporting Resale Price Maintenance has been presented to the Office of Fair Trading.
The presentation of the petition, organised by the Labour Party, was made on Wednesday by shadow consumer minister Nigel Griffiths MP and Brenda Prentice MP. National Pharmaceutical Association deputy director John Darcy and Bill Mickey MP were also present.
<p>
Mr Griffiths co-ordinated the campaign by asking local Labour groups to collect the petition through community pharmacies (C&D July 13, p41).
<p>
Other groups that have expressed their support for the Community Pharmacy Action Group's fight to keep RPM include the Patient's Association, the Women's Institute, Scope, Mind, National Aids Trust and Pensioners Voice.
<p>
<li>The Consumers' Association has responded to the OFT, supporting the ending of RPM. "We think that RPM should be removed, but there should be a review of the way in which pharmacists are remunerated," says Phil Green of the CA. "RPM is the wrong tool for the job, taxing consumers is not the best way."
<p>
Other issues the CA consider important are the Essential Small Pharmacies Scheme and entry.

<h3>Station to count as neighbourhood</h3>
<P>
A pharmacy planning to open in a railway station has made reference to the recent neighbourhood ruling in its application.
The application to open a pharmacy in Templemead Station, Bristol, made in the name of Alison Shirley, cites the Justice Tucker decision (C&D June 1, p753). This says that a neighbourhood need not be dependent on having a residential area. The Christiansen case of four years ago is cited in support of the application, which involved a pharmacy opening in a shopping centre. Several city mainline stations already have pharmacies.
<p>
Avon Health Authority has granted the contract, saying that the application was desirable, as there is a small residential population in the vicinity of the station, and that the area is not currently served by a community pharmacy. Local pharmacists are set to appeal against the HA's decision on the grounds that the new pharmacy is unnecessary and will not offer additional services. They believe that if the pharmacy is to provide a service for the large number of commuters it should open from 7.00am to 10.00pm. 
<p>
Avon HA spokeswoman Mrs Pelter says that all pharmacy applications have to satisfy the requirements that the pharmacy is necessary and desirable. She was not prepared to comment on any specific case.

<h3>Norton rolls out new Advantage credit scheme</h3>
<P>
Norton Healthcare is rolling out a new membership card scheme, called Norton Advantage, to increase sales of its generic drugs.
While Norton Advantage currently involves only orders placed direct to the company, it hopes AAH and Unichem will be involved in the scheme within the next two months.
<p>
Their co-operation should enable Norton Advantage members to order generics daily, instead of placing stock orders. Pharmacists will therefore be able to reduce their stockholdings and overcome the problems of storage space that the move of generics into OPD threatens to cause.
<p>
Nigel Fox, Norton's communications director, says Norton Advantage members need no longer waste valuable time shopping around to get the best prices for products at the expense of service and continuity. 
"Over time, business partnerships with wholesalers will be formed and the pharmacist will then have the benefit of purchasing all his generic requirements from his favourite wholesaler with the convenience of regular deliveries and 'one-stop shopping', and the benefit of Norton Advantage credits," he says.
<p>
Pharmacists pay 35 to become members of the scheme, which entitles them to a 10 per cent discount on the company's products. They are then awarded credits against their purchase, so that it equates to the same price that pharmacists would have paid for the product at current market prices.
<p>
Because the discount is not product-specific, pharmacists can redeem their Norton Advantage credits, in part or whole, against Norton Healthcare's range of more than 350 products, including the Baker Norton range of branded products, or other goods and services. The company says the pharmacist is free to choose how and when he converts his discount.
<p>
The company, which claims a market-leading 40 per cent share of generic sales, has spent more than 1 million over two years to establish the system, which it believes will help counter the gradual erosion of pharmacists' profits.
<p>
David Boothe, product manager at Norton's marketing department, says the company wants to stop pharmacists' fixation on generic prices. "The only way to stop the erosion of profits is to persuade pharmacists to look at something other than cost," he says. "We want pharmacists to stop buying drugs on price alone."
<p>
"Advantage plans to offer pharmacists a good price on drugs without altering their Tariff price," he adds.
<p>
So far, 2,000 pharmacists have joined the scheme and Norton aims to recruit another 3,000 by the end of the year.
<p>
The company actively promoted the scheme at Chemex '96 and says it was delighted with the response. It recruited 87 new members at the show and took a number of orders from existing members

<h3>South Humber GPs implement voluntary ban on Diconal</h3>
<P>
Over three-quarters of GPs in South Humberside have implemented a voluntary ban on Diconal prescribing in an attempt to cut violence against surgery staff.
<p>
Posters in surgeries inform patients that other alternatives are available for severe pain and that, for those addicted to the drug, the surgery does not have the required Home Office licence to prescribe. The health authority has warned pharmacists to re-assess their stockholding of Diconal in view of the ban.
<p>
David Fullard, head of consumer and corporate relations, South Humber Health Authority, told C&D that Grimsby, in particular, had a major problem with Diconal abuse, with an associated increase in verbal and physical violence against GPs and their staff. Addicts inject the crushed tablets or sell them to get money for other drugs, such as cocaine.
<p>
Mr Fullard said that the area led the way with a voluntary ban on temazepam two years before it was blacklisted. He hoped for similar action on Diconal.
<p>
Glaxo Wellcome believes the decision to prescribe should remain at doctor-patient level.

<H3><B>Asda takes RPM fight to Europe</B></H3>
<P>
Asda has re-opened its assault on Resale Price Maintenance by taking its fight to the European Commission.
<P>
The supermarket chain says that RPM infringes the Treaty of Rome and hopes to have the practice declared illegal, giving it the go-ahead to cut prices on OTC medicines and vitamins.
<P>
Asda, which led the fight that destroyed the Net Book Agreement last year, cut prices on over 80 RPM-covered brands in October last year, but was forced to restore prices to RPM levels after manufacturers, including Seven Seas and Roche, took out injunctions in the High Court.
<P>
"RPM on medicines and vitamins must go," says Nick Cooper, Asda's corporate counsel. "The right to price maintain was originally granted in the public interest. It was certainly not intended to allow drug companies to fix higher than necessary prices on the basis of a 25-year-old law." Asda believes that some retailers and suppliers are making 100 per cent profit on certain drugs and medicines.
<P>
The chain believes that RPM means the public is paying over the odds for medicines. "This is another outmoded piece of junk law which limits competition and protects the profit margins of the establishment," says Mr Cooper.
<P>
Asda is imminently expecting confirmation of a binding tariff  declaration made on the unenforceability of price maintenance on cod liver oil from Dutch customs and excise. Officials have already indicated verbally that bulk cod liver oil will be classified as a product that cannot be resale price maintained.
<P>
"With that ruling in our hands, the public will be asking why they have to pay artificially-high prices just because multi-national drug companies put cod liver oil in a bottle with a dosage on the back," says Mr Cooper.
<P>
The Office of Fair Trading is currently carrying out an investigation into RPM, but is not expected to report until the autumn. Analysts, and industry and pharmacy associations agree that the demise of RPM could lead to some independent pharmacists being put out of business. In addition, drug manufacturers and larger retailers, such as Boots, could see margins eroded and profits drop.
<P>
The OFT last reviewed RPM in 1970 and industry players believe that there have not been any significant changes in the market place since then.
<P>
A spokesman for Boots says that the 1970 arguments are just as relevant today and adds that the company supports RPM because it ensures that medicines remain readily available to the whole population.

<H3><B>Scots reluctantly accept 2.5% rise for 95/96</B></H3>
<P>
Pharmacists in Scotland have reluctantly accepted a 2.5 per cent pay offer for 1995-96. The offer is a slight improvement on the original 2 per cent proposed last October. But the Scottish Office has made it clear that there is no prospect of any increase in the 2.5 per cent uplift in the global sum proposed on February 27.
<P>
The offer is subject to the following conditions:
<UL>
<LI>that progress is made on local negotiations on payments for providing advice to residential homes, for needle exchange schemes and for the disposal of waste medicines
<LI>keeping patient medication records would become a requirement for professional allowance payment
<LI>the fees paid for Controlled Drugs, serial dispensing and oxygen services would be reviewed
<LI>on-cost on stock orders would be reduced to 5 per cent over the next three years
<LI>repeat prescribing/dispensing schemes would be introduced during the period 1996-97.
</UL>
In accepting the offer, the Scottish Pharmaceutical Standing Committee has agreed to discuss proposals for local negotiations, monitoring professional allowance, introduction of repeat prescribing/dispensing systems and a review of fees paid for CDs, serial dispensing and oxygen services. 
<P>
However, the Committee made the following points:
<UL>
<LI>once again the expected increase in prescription volume (3.16 per cent) and associated dispensing fees is greater than the increase allowed in the global sum
<LI>the Committee asked for an assurance that funding to boards for pharmacists' advice to residential homes, needle exchange schemes and waste medicines disposal would be clearly identified and not used for any other purposes
<LI>the Committee asked how payments for PMRs would be integrated into the professional allowance in the light of proposals for monitoring the allowance
<LI>the Committee also asked for results of a study on pharmacist involvement in substitution programmes for drug misusers to be made available to help in the review of CD fees
<LI>the Committee asked what action the Department would take to remove the anomaly whereby appliance suppliers would be still be paid a high rate of on-cost  - an anomaly which could no longer be defended
<LI>on repeat prescribing/dispensing, the Committee asked for the Department's detailed proposals for establishing pilot schemes in which the General Medical Council would have a direct input. Existing trials, with which participating contractors were  unhappy, should be suspended pending further discussions.
</UL>
The Committee chairman, Andrew Taylor, says detailed discussions on the implementation of the pay offer will start soon. An offer for 1996-97 is not expected until negotiations are resolved in England and Wales.

<H3><B>Bright future predicted for pharmacy sales</B></H3>
<P>
Sales through UK pharmacies and drugstores are expected to grow 15 per cent in real terms between 1994 and 1999.
<P>
Pharmacies fared well during the recession with sales holding up, but growth slowed markedly in 1994, giving cause for concern, according to a new Euromonitor report, 'Pharmacies and drugstores  - the international market'.
<P>
The unexpected slowdown, with sales growing 1 per cent in 1994 compared with 5.8 per cent a year earlier, could be due to the deregulation of some medicines and the wider retail distribution of OTC products, says the report. If so, pharmacists should be concerned because both these factors will have an increasing effect in the years to come.
<P>
The Euromonitor report reviews the period from 1990 to 1994 and concludes that during this time the role of multiples has increased, with 73 per cent of pharmacy and drugstore sales accounted for by five companies. It adds that in-store pharmacies are emerging as an important new retail format.

<H3><B>OTC medicines training pack for pharmacists and GPs</B></H3>
<P>
A new over the counter medicines training pack for use among general practitioners and pharmacists is now available, thanks to sponsorship by the Proprietary Association of Great Britain.
<P>
'Self medication  - a prescription for change' is a resource tool for health authority professional advisers, general practitioner training course organisers and postgraduate pharmacy trainers, with the two-fold aim of boosting knowledge of OTCs among health professionals and improving collaboration between GPs and pharmacists.
<P>
The pack comprises a short video and manual, which can be used by small multi-disciplinary groups in a task-based interactive approach. The video contains five scenarios for self-treatment, bolstered by further clinical scenarios in the manual. The pack is deemed sufficient for one three-hour period and is suitable for use at under- and postgraduate level. It can also be used by nurses.
<P>
Dr Robert Walker, director of primary care for North Cumbria Health Authority, who was involved in developing the pack, reveals the average GP with a list of 1,900 patients sees 506 minor conditions per year. If these patients did not visit the doctor, 84 hours of consulting time could be saved, an extra one and a half hours per week. "It's a significant freeing up of time if a lot of these minor illnesses could be self-managed," he says. 
<P>
Dr Bob Button of Hampshire Local Medical Committee, also involved in developing the pack, disputes the perception that OTCs are ineffective or inferior treatments. "It's an optional treatment choice," he says.
<P>
Dr Button adds: "We need to establish loyalty to pharmacists to try and establish that the pharmacist is just as much your adviser as the doctor is. The way to do this is to increase POM to P switches."The resource pack is available from the PAGB at a cost of 155.65, including VAT.

<H3><B>Lichwer swallows up Medic Herb</B></H3>
<P>
Lichtwer Pharma, the plant-based health supplement firm, has bought Medic Herb (UK) herbal medicine company.
<P>
Lichtwer paid "a very good price" for Medic Herb, according to a spokesman for the supplement manufacturer. Medic Herb, which turned in sales to the retail sector of 600,000 last year, was a subsidiary of Pharbio, Sweden, and has six licensed herbal medicines: Valerina Day and Night Time, Sabalin, Uvacin, Revitonil and Aqualette.
<P>
Kallo Group will continue to distribute Medic Herb products in the UK, while Lichtwer products, which include the Kwai, Kira and Ginkyo brands, will still be distributed through Chemist Brokers.
<P>
"Medic Herb, with its range of high-quality licensed products, gives us an immediate UK position in herbal medicines. These [products] will act as a platform on which to rapidly develop our objective of becoming the leading UK company with herbal medicine products backed by modern research," says Paul Kerry, Lichtwer's UK managing director.
<P>
Lichtwer plans to back the Medic Herb brand with 500,000 in advertising, which will begin in May, 1996. Lichtwer brands will be supported by an advertising spend of over 2.5 million this year.
<P>
Lichtwer Pharma, based in Germany, sells licensed products, with 50 per cent of its sales on prescription.

<H3><B>Pharmacist to stand for Parliament</B></H3>
<P>
A pharmacist has been adopted as the Conservative candidate for the Norwich South constituency.
<P>
Bahir Khanbhai will be fighting a 6,000 Labour majority at the next general election, and would be the only Conservative pharmacist MP if elected. His track record includes unexpectedly pushing a Liberal Democrat into third place in a Kent County Council election.
<P>
Since being adopted by Norwich South, he has been working as a locum in the city, although he also runs an export company.
<P>
Defending the charge that Conservatives have treated pharmacists badly, Mr Khanbhai says: "The Conservatives are pumping a lot of money into the NHS and pharmacists deserve to have a large slice of the cake. 
<P>
"Pharmacists must make sure that they get into the minister's team of advisers. It is the only way to achieve the status that the BMA has," he says and adds that he will fight the pharmacy cause "tooth and nail".

<H3><B>Young Pharmacists' hustings cancelled</B></H3>
<P>
The Young Pharmacists' Group Council candidates hustings has been cancelled. Due to run on April 21, the event had only secured the attendance of one Council candidate, Alan Nathan. Others could not attend through prior engagements or refused to take part.
<P>
Joel Hirst, the YPG vice chairman says the organisation is very disappointed. "I think it's a blow for democracy that the candidates seem unwilling to present themselves in front of people. We feel the membership will not be happy with this arrogance."
<P>
However, the YPG will use this as a spur to push for greater accountability from Council members in the coming year. "We are going to take a much more aggressive stand," warns Mr Hirst. The organisation intends to run hustings next year.
<P>
The YPG's West Midlands regional conference will still run at Walsall's Friendly Hotel on April 20-21.

<H3><B>RPSGB may guide on PMR sales</B></H3>
<P>

The Royal Pharmaceutical Society's Council is to consider drafting guidance for pharmacists on the confidentiality of information held in their patient medication systems.
<P>
Data marketing organisations are taking a commercial interest in information they can pass on to pharmaceutical companies, such as the types of drugs prescribed and doctors' prescribing habits. Council members are concerned about the disclosure of prescribing information to third parties and believe the level of confidentiality might differ between pharmacies. 
<P>
Data from a pharmacy whose prescriptions came from a large number of prescribers and which could not be linked to an individual prescriber or practice might not need the same degree of confidentiality as data from a pharmacy dealing mainly with a single prescriber.
<P>
One member of the Law and Ethics Policy Committee urged Council last week to discourage pharmacists from disclosing any prescribing data. Such disclosure could undermine doctors' confidence in pharmacists' ability to maintain confidentiality. The National Pharmaceutical Association has issued a warning about selling PMR data in its August Supplement. It explains that database marketing organisations must not collect patients' personal data and must seek the prescribers' permission before using information that would identify them.
<P>
The NPA has not endorsed any of the organisations which collect prescribing data because it believes market forces are likely to achieve the best value for members. To date, the NPA is aware of only two active participants, both having ''solid international reputations''. These are IMS, which has links with Taylor Nelson/John Richardson, and Source Informatics, which has links with Mediphase.
<P>
The NPA's Trefor Williams told C&D that there were significant advantages to some of the deals, but they would impose obligations on pharmacists, who should weigh up the pros and cons and decide for themselves. He thought reputable companies would handle prescriber confidentiality in ways that should not cause problems.
<P>
John Richardson Computers is offering pharmacists free re-placement hardware every four years if they regularly supply information on items dispensed. Pharmacists have to pay a nominal 1 to own the equipment. Managing director Christine Thom told C&D: ''Nothing we are doing contravenes the Data Protection Act or compromises the pharmacist's integrity.''
<P>
Pharmacists would not need to identify patients and the company would ask GPs concerned for permission to collect the information. She added that Taylor Nelson had collected pharmacy data for years. Source Informatics has a contract with Mediphase to collect data from pharmacists with their consent. In return, pharmacists receive a free or replacement computer.
<P>
Source Informatics collects no information on patients, just on prescribed items, and only gives regional analyses on an anonymous basis. No information relating to individual doctors is produced without their consent. ''We wouldn't do anything to upset the relationship between pharmacists and doctors,'' a spokesman commented. Source Informatics may eventually arrange deals with other software companies.

<H3><B>Nottingham GP asks for judicial review</B></H3>
<P>

A dispensing doctor fighting a pharmacy opening near Nottingham is seeking leave for a judicial review. Last year, two pharmacies applied for an NHS contract in Burton Joyce. One was rejected, but Burrows and Close was successful as it already had pharmacy contracts in the area so did not need to go through a 'prejudice' test. 
<P>
Dr Chris Guyler is opposing the pharmacy on the grounds that loss of income from dispensing would prevent him from employing a second doctor. He is being supported by the British Medical Association's general medical services defence fund. A BMA spokeswoman said the case would not proceed until after some other rural dispensing cases were resolved, including that of Dr Michael Wilson and partners in Dunnington, in which the High Court ruled in favour of a pharmacy opening. 
<P>
Nottingham Community Health Council (CHC) has voted to support the pharmacy, despite 900 objections being sent to MP Andrew Mitchell, whose wife is a dispensing doctor. The local medical committee also asked the CHC to intervene. Gordon Ellis, a director of Burrows and Close, told C&D he had no idea when a pharmacy would open as it depended on the result of any further legal action. The company had lost the original premises, but there were plenty of other properties available in the village, he said.

<H3><B>Northern Ireland publishes health strategy for next century</B></H3>
<P>

A new strategy taking Northern Ireland's health and social care into the next century has been launched. The Regional Strategy, 'Health and wellbeing: into the next millennium', will run from 1997-2002. Published by the Department of Health & Social Security, it sets the tone for health and social service policies, with the aim of improving the physical and mental health, and social wellbeing of the population of Northern Ireland.
<P>
The strategy is the fourth in a series of five-year policies, which began in 1983. The main burden of implementation will fall on the four health boards, but all health and social service professionals will be involved. Areas which relate specifically to pharmacy include the benefits of medicine deregulation (POM to P switches), medicines management, medicine compliance. The development of clinical pharmacy services in the community is also proposed.
<P>
Pharmacist Dr Terry Maguire, a lecturer at Queens University in Belfast, welcomes the proposals. ''It is a terrific opportunity for pharmacy, but there is a danger that if we don't recognise this, we will lose out again,'' he says. DHSS spokesman Sean Mulhern says that the strategy is very much a broad policy framework. ''It has a lot in common with the Health of the Nation policy, in that it sets targets, such as reducing smoking, drinking and premature death, but it covers much more than just health gains.''
<P>
Four themes of the existing strategy will be continued. These are: promoting health and social wellbeing; targeting health and social need; improving care in the community; and improving acute care. Seven key areas of concern have also been identified:
<P>
<OL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>family and child health and welfare
<LI>physical/sensory disability
<LI>learning disability
<LI>mental health
<LI>circulatory diseases
<LI>cancers
<LI>non-communicable diseases.

</OL>
<P>
Northern Ireland's chief pharmacist, Dr Norman Morrow, says: ''The document sets out the health programme for the next five years, in which there is opportunity for pharmacists to make a positive contribution.''

<H3><B>Health of the Nation targets missed</B></H3>
<P>

The Health of the Nation targets set by the Department of Health in 1992 have failed on three counts: obesity, drinking by women and smoking by the young. Data for 1993 showed the proportions of obese men and women  aged 16-64 rose to 13 per cent and 16 per cent respectively, according to a progress report from the National Audit Office. The target set was to reduce the proportion of obese men from 7 per cent in 1986-87 to 6 per cent in 2005. The proportion of obese women was to be cut from 12 per cent to 8 per cent. 
<P>
The proportion of women drinking more than the recommended sensible levels rose from 11 per cent in 1990 to 13 per cent in 1994 and targets are not expected to be met by 2005. There was no downward trend in men's drinking habits.  Smoking by children aged 11-15 rose from 8 per cent in 1988 to 12 per cent in 1994. The target was set at 6 per cent by 1994. 
<P>
However, good progress was made in 11 of the 27 targets, including coronary heart disease, stroke, breast cancer, lung cancer in men and gonorrhoea.  Insufficient information was available to assess progress in blood pressure, cervical cancer, skin cancer, smoking in pregnancy, suicide in the mentally ill, health and social functioning of the mentally ill, and needle sharing among drug misusers.
<P>
The DoH will be deciding on whether to revise certain targets and will be looking to improve the standard of data, particularly in mental health.

<H3><B>Council sets the standard for repeat scripts</B></H3>
<P>

The Royal Pharmaceutical Society's Council has adopted a set of standards for community pharmacists providing a repeat prescription service.  The standards will form a new section in the 'Standards of Good Professional Practice', which forms an appendix to the Code of Ethics. A repeat medication service is defined as one that is run in co-operation with local prescribers, in which a pharmacist gives professional support to help in the rational and effective use of medicines. The standards specify that:
<P>
<UL>

<LI>The pharmacy must operate a patient medication record system, registered with the Data Protection registrar, if appropriate, and ensure that an audit trail exists to identify each request and supply so as to enable the service to be monitored.
<LI>The request for the service must come from the patient or carer and be recorded in writing, signed by the patient or carer. The pharmacist must not act as the carer for this purpose.
<LI>A pharmacist must establish with the prescriber or from the prescription form the period for which repeats will be issued, unless the patient needs earlier review. On dispensing the final repeat prescription, the pharmacist must remind the patient in writing of the need to visit the prescriber.
<LI>A pharmacist may institute a patient reminder system but may not request a repeat prescription from a surgery before obtaining the patient's or carer's consent.
<LI>At the time of each request the pharmacist must establish which items the patient considers are required and ensure that unnecessary supplies are not made. At this stage, the pharmacist must also use professional judgment to decide whether compliance or other problems may require early reference to the prescriber.
<LI>Records of all interventions should be kept.

<P>

Council also approved an amendment to the Code of Ethics guidance to reflect the new standards.

<H3><B>Face to face obligations</B></H3>
<P>

The Royal Pharmaceutical Society's Code of Ethics is to be am-ended to include a specific obligation on the need for face to face contact with patients or carers. The Society's Council has adopted the following new obligation to Principle 1 of the Code: ''A pharmacist must, on each occasion he provides a pharmaceutical service, use his professional judgment to decide whether he needs to see the patient or carer in person.'' 
<P>
Council also agreed to adopt the following guidance on that obligation: ''A necessary part of pharmaceutical care is direct face to face consultation between the pharmacist and the patient or carer. This need not occur on every occasion a professional service is provided. However, a pharmacist has a professional duty to ensure that it occurs when considered necessary with a medicine for an acute condition or at appropriate intervals for repeat medication.
<P>
''In the community pharmacy setting this applies equally when the patient or carer calls at the pharmacy or when medicines are delivered to the patient's home. In determining what amounts to an appropriate interval, the pharmacist will consider the specific needs of the patient. The pharmacist should consider factors such as the nature of the medication, the length of time between repeat prescriptions, the patient's circumstances, home environment and level of support available.''
<P>
<STRONG>Hospital dispensing</STRONG> Council also approved the addition of a new obligation to the Code of Ethics which would ensure that hospital pharmacies had appropriate systems for the supply, storage and use of inpatient medicines. Pharmacists would also have a responsibility to provide sufficient information to ensure that all medicines supplied to in-patients were used safely, effectively and appropriately. 
<P>
<STRONG>Watch those windows</STRONG> Inspectors will be asked, in their next round of visits, to advise pharmacists whose pharmacy windows did not present a professional image. The poor appearance of some windows was detrimental to the profession's standing, Council heard. There were criticisms of the inappropriate and excessive use of stickers.
<P>
<STRONG>Pharmacist badge</STRONG> Council approved a design for an identification badge which carries the Society's crest and the title 'pharmacist'. Badges will be sent free to newly-registered pharmacists with their certificates.  Dispensing assistant training The Practice Committee is to explore the possibility of the Society introducing a requirement to train dispensing assistants. It seemed anomalous to have training requirements for medicines counter assistants but not for dispensing assistants.
<P>
<STRONG>Packaging waste</STRONG> A small, expert group is to prepare a response to the Department of the Environment's consultation document on packaging waste. The Government aims to recover 50 per cent of all waste packaging materials and recycle at least 25 per cent. The pharmaceutical industry would be legally obliged to set up recovery schemes or to contribute to national schemes.
<P>
<STRONG> Hospital future</STRONG> Council agreed to set up a working party to develop a vision for the future of hospital pharmacy, taking account of all aspects of the use of medicines in secondary care. Registration exam A revised syllabus for the registration exam, effective from 1997, will give more prominence to patient-centred aspects.

<H3><B>Nutricia owns Milupa - official!</B></H3>
<P>

NV Nutricia's acquisition of Milupa has been cleared by the Mon-polies and Mergers Commission. The MMC says that Milupa's UK activities overlap those of Nutricia in the enteral clinical nutrition products, baby drinks, baby meals and baby milks markets. However, it concludes that the merger is unlikely to adversely affect these markets. Nutricia, based in the Netherlands, acquired Milupa for DM820 million last year. Nutricia operates in the UK through Nutricia Holdings and its subsidiaries, which includes Cow & Gate Nutricia.
<P>
Competition aside, the MMC says the merger will probably save Milupa's baby milk brand, whose long-term survival had been in doubt because of the company's losses. It also concludes that the merger will not harm baby milk prices, although Professor S Eilon, a member of the MMC group, disagrees. 
<P>
Both SMA and Nutricia have been warned that they will be referred to the director general of Fair Trading if they try to raise baby milk prices ''unjustifiably''. (The director general has been keeping a close watch on the baby milk market since last year, due to the concentration of companies there.)

<H3><B>RPSGB sets standards for over the counter sales</B></H3>
<P>

The Royal Pharmaceutical Society's Council has adopted a set of standards for the sale of non-prescribed medicines from community pharmacies. The standards will form a new section in the Standards of Good Professional Practice, an appendix to the Code of Ethics.
<P>
A pharmacist in personal control of a pharmacy must observe the following standards:
<P>
1a Request for advice on treatment of symptoms/conditions. The pharmacist or assistant must obtain sufficient information to allow an assessment that self-medication is appropriate and to enable a suitable product to be recommended. Questioning using the 2-WHAM or similar approach would be suitable. Appropriate advice must be given on the use of recommended products.
<br>
1b Request for a medicine by name. The pharmacist must ensure that the procedures for sales of medicines provide for professional advice and intervention whenever this can assist in the safe and effective use of non-prescribed medicines. The pharmacist or assistant should obtain sufficient information to allow an assessment that the medicine is likely to be appropriate for the person concerned. The pharmacist or assistant must provide any advice which is considered appropriate to the product and the intended consumer.
<br>
2 Pharmacist's involvement. The procedures must ensure that the pharmacist is personally involved whenever this is necessary to provide a good standard of pharmaceutical care. Assistants should be trained to know when the pharmacist should be consulted.
<br>
3 Special purchasers or users. The procedures should ensure particular care when supplying products for or to children, the elderly and other special groups.
<br>
4 Medicines requiring special care. The pharmacist must ensure that he is involved in the decision to supply any medicine which requires special care. For example, POM to P switches, those subject to abuse or misuse, or where the licence for non-prescription use is restricted to selected conditions.

<H3><B>New danger for the New Age?</B></H3>
<P>

Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee chairman Wally Dove is ''appalled'' by the way the Royal Pharmaceutical Society's 'New Age' approaches the subject of remuneration.
<P>
''I am not the 'new danger' for the 'New Age','' he told the Unichem Convention in Bermuda on Tuesday, but added that: ''PSNC will be doing all it can to point out to the Society the danger lurking within PIANA, and the need to think again.''
<P>
Echoing the words of his vice chairman, who spoke at the Lincolnshire LPC Conference at the weekend, he urged the Society not to jeopardise the progress that PSNC is making to resolve the dispensing doctor problem. Rather than proposing new initiatives or unilateral approaches to the medical profession, it would be more helpful if the Society supported work already in train.
<P>
One area he wanted the Society to concentrate on was standards of professionalism and premises. ''It is about time the Society acted to ensure higher standards throughout community pharmacy, so the vast majority are not let down by the small but highly-visible minority.''

<H3><B>NPA team begins to find the cash</B></H3>
<P>

The professional development team set up last year by the National Pharmaceutical Association has notched up a number of recent successes in obtaining health authority funding for community pharmacy services.
<P>
South Lancashire Health Authority, with the help of NW Region co-ordinator Andrew Riley, is looking to implement a prescribing support project, potentially worth 90,000 over a three-year period. It is an extension of an existing  Department of Health project, says Mr Riley, who is working with the HA's pharmaceutical adviser, Helen Allanson, and the LPC.
<P>
So far at least, 30 medical practices have expressed an interest in using a pharmacist's services. About 30 pharmacists have also expressed interest. They will be accredited to provide advice after attending a residential course in mid-November, when the scheme will be launched to GPs.
<P>
''The objective is to get pharmacists in a sustainable relationship with doctors,'' says Mr Riley. He is also working with Geoff Bourne, pharmaceutical adviser at North Staffordshire Health Authority, on developing a 35,000 domiciliary visiting project. Funding has still to be finalised, but it is intended that the project should run for a year from next April, followed by six months' evaluation.
<P>
The project will involve social services alerting participating pharmacists to 'problem patients'. They will visit patients, assess them and formulate a care plan. 
<P>
In the North East Region, Sandra Parnham is working with health authorities to set up a smoking cessation scheme, a medication review service in Cumbria and a health promotion project in Leeds.
<P>
She is also working with Nottingham Health Authority to invest 50,000 in prescribing advice, training and palliative care. In Leeds, she is working on a scheme with the pharmaceutical adviser to provide care for terminally ill patients.
<P>
Alison Strath, who covers Scotland, has been appointed to the Health Education Board of Scotland, which is responsible for allocating 30,000 to the pharmacy sector for health promotion work.
<P>
Alan Gilbert, who is co-ordinator in the South West, is pursuing smoking cessation projects in Avon and Powys, and prescribing advice projects in North and East Hampshire and Worcester. Berkshire Health Authority has also asked him to evaluate a local needle exchange scheme.
<P>
<li>The team of co-ordinators has been strengthened by a new member, Helen van der Kraan. She previously worked in sales for Bayer and will be covering the South East.

<H3><B>Unichem launches community scheme</B></H3>
<P>

Unichem is launching a pilot scheme this month - 'Community Pharmacy' - that aims to turn independent pharmacies into local centres for healthcare advice. The scheme will encourage consumers to ask pharmacists for health advice, which should raise the local profiles of independent pharmacies and increase their customer throughput.
<P>
The accessibility of independents and the time they have to give discreet, professional advice are their strongest weapons against the impersonal supermarkets, according to Unichem. About 100 pharmacists will take part in the pilot and Community Pharmacy is expected to go nationwide in January. 
<P>
Unichem's area managers will recommend pharmacies to join the scheme. Alternatively, pharmacists can approach Unichem by speaking first to their account development managers. Peter Skinner, Unichem's marketing controller, says membership will be restricted to pharmacists with good professional standards. Unichem will process recruitment applications as soon as it can, he adds.
<P>
The company says a 'think tank' of pharmacists it set up about 18 months ago played a ''fundamental role'' in developing the scheme. The name, Community Pharmacy, reflects research that suggests 33.2 per cent of consumers feel they can ask pharmacists for health advice, whereas 21.3 per cent only said the same for 'chemists'.
<P>
Unichem's support package includes merchandising equipment that emphasises the member's quality service. This includes a customer service charter, which outlines six services the pharmacist provides, ranging from healthcare advice to value for money.
<P>
The company will also target promotions at selected members. It says this approach will be far more effective than its original policy of including all its customers, irrespective of whether the promotion would suit them.
<P>
It is setting up a database of pharmacies around the country to help its targeting. About 1,500 detailed questionnaires have been sent out, each of which has 38 questions, ranging from the outlet's ratio of private brands and own-brands to the main age band of its customers. Another 500 will be sent out soon.
<P>
Members will also have community care price card wallets, which they can hang on their windows to highlight the latest promotions. The cards will cover about 120 core range items. Such promotions will be supplemented by local advertising, door drops and community sponsorship schemes. Unichem is also conducting trials with leading suppliers, including Procter & Gamble's skin care division, to find out the most effective ways of using their planograms.
<P>
Manufacturers will be able to offer special promotions for Community Pharmacy members, although Unichem stresses these will also be offered to its Goldpartner members.
<P>
''We cannot stop the erosion of OTC sales to supermarkets, but we can increase consumer flow and increase their impulse and distress purchases. These purchases play an important part in any mass market. Through that, we can maintain and maybe build up some of that business,'' says Mr Skinner.
<P>
<li>Unichem has acquired three pharmacies, Coulson and Fisher in Cambridgeshire, E Johnston in Harleston and a Plumstead-based outlet of C Jaypharm, for its Moss chain.

<H3><B>Peter Black pays 2.5m for Gerard House</B></H3>
<P>

Peter Black Healthcare is expanding its stake in the UK natural healthcare market with the acquisition of Gerard House for 2.5 million.
<P>
Gerard House, a subsidiary of Scholl, manufactures and distributes licensed and unlicensed herbal medicines, essential oils and aromatherapy products to community pharmacies and other retail outlets. It reported a turnover of 2.5m for the year to December, 1995.
<P>
Peter Black, trading as English Grains Healthcare, produces vitamins, minerals, dietary supplements and herbal remedies. Its portfolio includes Red Kooga and Folic Plus. The two companies are expected to be integrated in the new year. Meanwhile, Scholl Consumer Products will continue to sell and distribute Gerard House's brands on behalf of English Grains. Pharmacists are advised to place separate orders for Gerard House and English Grains' products until they hear from Peter Black.

<H3><B>Innovex set to make Haigh worth 300m</B></H3>
<P>

Innovex, the privately-held contract pharmaceutical research company founded by UK pharmacist Barrie Haigh, is to be bought by the US contract research group Quintiles. It is believed that Mr Haigh has a 55 per cent shareholding in Innovex, which would be worth 300 million if the sale goes ahead.
<P>
Mr Haigh, who is a board member of the Association of British Pharmaceutical Industry, founded the Buckinghamshire-based company in 1979. It provides research facilities for pharmaceutical manufacturers who would find in-house research too expensive.
<P>
With the Innovex alliance, Quintiles would be able to expand its full-service capabilities beyond drug development and offer its customers sales and marketing services.  Mr Haigh would serve as vice chairman of the combined company, which would be chaired by Dennis Gillings, who would also continue as its chief executive officer.

<H3><B>Bid uncertainty hits Lloyds</B></H3>
<P>

The uncertainty caused by the two competing bids for Lloyds Chemists has made its impact on the company's annual results released on Wednesday. However, chairman Allen Lloyd says he is not aware of any difficulties arising from the conditions laid down by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, and expects the necessary undertakings by Unichem and Gehe to be finalised by October 18.
<P>
Group profits before losses on disposal of fixed assets (amounting to 2.5 million) and tax are down from 54.4m in 1994-95 to 49.5m. Fully-diluted earnings per share have fallen from 29.3p to 23.85p, although the net dividend is up 0.2p to 10.4p. On the plus side, gearing has been reduced from 43 to 33 per cent. Nor did the impact of the bids hold back sales growth.
<P>
Group turnover for the year to June 30 was up 5 per cent from 1,081.5m to 1,135.5m, with increases across all the core business. Overall sales performance was affected by the planned closure of over a third of drugstore outlets. Turnover in this division fell by 32.1 per cent.
<P>
Chemist division turnover rose 5.4 per cent from 483.7m to 509.6m with like for like growth of 4 per cent. However, margins were not maintained and profits  fell to 43.1m from the previous year's 45.1m. Over 140 stores were refitted during the year and new window displays installed in 628. 
<P>
The pharmaceutical division suffered most from the uncertain climate. While external turnover rose 7.7 per cent from 351.4m to 378.5m, operating profits were 13.2m, a fall of 2.8m from the previous year. The Holland & Barrett health food business posted record profits, up 7.5 per cent to 7.8m on a turnover up 17.5 per cent to 90.6m. Forty-two new stores opened during the year, taking the chain to 393.
<P>
The veterinary division boosted turnover by 16.6 per cent to just over 100m, with operating profits at 4.2m. A profits warning issued on July 9 had indicated that group profits in the second half would be adversely affected by the uncertainty and costs associated with the bids. It is now more than eight months since Unichem announced its first offer.
<P>
''With the prospect of the lengthy bid process reaching a climax in the near future, the board believes its strategy of focusing on profitable and growing sectors of the retail, pharmaceutical and veterinary markets is sound, and this has been clearly demonstrated by the values placed on the company by Gehe and Unichem,'' said Mr Lloyd.
<P>
The current year has started well, he added, with sales growth across core businesses.

<H1 align=center><B>Medicine sales beat inflation</B></H1>
Sales of over the counter medicines and food supplements rose by 4.7 per cent last year, faster than the rate of inflation.
<P>
With a market value of 1,240.9 million, according to Proprietary Association of Great Britain estimates, the therapeutic categories that have shown the greatest increase have been those boosted by new product launches, in particular POM to P switches. The three best-performing sectors were gynaecological products (25.8 per cent increase), sleeping and calming products (24.4 per cent), and stomach upset remedies (21.2 per cent). 
<P>
However, the combined market share of these three sectors is still small at only 2 per cent, compared with the most dominant sectors: analgesics (16.6 per cent share, 7.9 per cent growth); skin treatments (12.4 per cent, 11.6 per cent growth), and cold remedies (8.3 per cent, 9.7 per cent growth).
<P>
The smoking cessation category is the poorest-performing sector, with a drop of 17.1 per cent. However, the PAGB says that this is to be expected, as the target market is in decline, with only 29 per cent of the population continuing to smoke.
<P>
Other categories showing a slight drop are travel sickness (down 2.1 per cent) and worm treatments (taking a drop of 3.6 per cent).
<P>
The figures, which are taken from IMS Self-medication and Nielsen, cover pharmacy and grocery sales, but exclude sales through drugstores and health-food shops.

<H3><B>Derisory NHS remuneration offer favours larger contractors</B></H3>
<P>
The "derisory" remuneration offer made to NHS pharmacy contractors would appear to favour larger contractors, according to David Sharpe, chairman of the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee. The offer is unacceptable and insulting, he said. For full details of the offer see <A HREF="http://www.dotpharmacy.co.uk/offer1.html">Information for community pharmacists</A>
<P>

<A NAME="b"></A>
<H3><B>Gehe puts up 584m for Lloyds Chemists</B></H3>
<P>
Gehe, the German wholesaler that owns AAH, has launched a counterbid for Lloyds Chemists - which was recommended by the Lloyds board after C&amp;D went to press, though talks with rival bidder Unichem are to continue.
<P>
The bid is a 450p cash offer for each Lloyds' ordinary share and 290p for each preference share, valuing Lloyds at 584 million. This compares with Unichem's cash and share offer of 404p for each ordinary share (figures based on last Wednesday's share prices).
<P>
The bid could be the start of a fierce bidding battle for Lloyds, whose 924 pharmacy outlets could make Unichem or AAH the largest pharmacy chain in the UK. As C&D went to press, Unichem said that it had noted the Gehe offer and was considering its response. It will be making an announcement "in due course" and urged Lloyds' shareholders to take no action until that time.
<P>
A spokesman confirmed that Lloyds is considering the Gehe offer. However, it is unlikely that Lloyds will recommend the Gehe bid to its shareholders until it has determined whether Unichem will make another, higher, offer.
<P>
Gehe has previously said that it wants to increase its retail pharmacy presence in the UK and that Lloyds Chemists would be a "complementary fit to AAH".
<P>
Gehe says that the acquisition would result in similar benefits to a Unichem acquisition, but it would be reviewing Lloyds' activities other than pharmaceutical wholesaling and retailing after the completion of offers.

<H3><B>RPM action group takes off</B></H3>
<P>
The fight to protect Resale Price Maintenance takes off in earnest this week with the formation of an umbrella action group and the appointment of a public relations company.
<P>
Amid the Office of Fair Trading's review of RPM, the Community Pharmacy Action Group, representing interested professional and industrial parties, has been set up. It aims to draw public attention to the wide-ranging adverse effects of its abolition, not just the financial implications for both pharmacists and manufacturers.
<P>
CPAG spokesman and Nat-ional Pharmaceutical Association director Tim Astill says: "We strongly believe that the loss of RPM on non-prescription medicines would have a negative impact on public health."
<P>
The initiative will "communicate the value of community pharmacy to a wide range of audiences," he adds. Foremost among these will be relieving GPs' burdens and making the best use of NHS resources.
<P>
PR firm Charles Barker has been appointed to handle publicity, with programme details to be announced shortly.
<P>
The conglomerate represents the NPA, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee, the Company Chemists Association, the Proprietary Articles Trade Association, the British Association of Pharmaceutical Wholesalers and the Proprietary Association of Great Britain.

<H3><B>New UK generics company</B></H3>
<P>
Bayer and Schein Pharmaceutical have set up a new generic medicine company in the UK, Ethical Generics.
<P>
The company hopes to bring a new approach to the UK generics market by focusing on customer needs, such as value for money, quality and service, but, above all, providing the products that customers actually want, says Roger Cuff, Ethical Generics' general manager.
<P>
Its initial portfolio will include products in the fields of cardiovascular disease, diabetes and pain control. The company hopes to have 12 products on the market by the end of 1996 and 30-40 by the end of the century. The first will be Unipine XL, a once a day nifedipine formulation, originally developed by Bayer. 
<P>
Ethical Generics operates from offices in Newbury, Berkshire. It is setting up a direct sales team, which will focus on selling to retail chains and wholesalers.  Pharmacists will be dealt with by a telesales team. It will use an  existing distribution chain, but will also deliver direct to customers where this is thought to be appropriate.

<H3><B>Malone acts as broker on rural issues</B></H3>
<P>
Health minister Gerald Malone is intent on resolving two rural issues which divide pharmacists and doctors, having met with both sides last week. 
<P>
The Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee has been pushing for an end to market town doctor dispensing, where surgeries within the town apply to dispense for patients outside the one-mile limit. Such situations exist in towns like Bury St Edmunds and threaten Berkeley, Humberside.
<P>
GPs are anxious to close the so-called 'Clothier loophole', which allows existing pharmacy contractors to open in rural areas, bypassing the test of prejudice to existing medical services.
<P>
Mr Malone wants to see the dispute resolved, but has made it clear he will not make a policy change without taking the interests of both parties into account.
<P>
It does require a policy change, he says. "The dispensing doctors say it does not, that it requires me simply to interpret properly the regulations. I do not take that view. It requires a policy change on both counts.
<P>
"I am happy to try and get an agreement, but on both fronts at the same time. If we can establish a consensus, even though that might not deliver to either profession everything they wish, then I am prepared to act as a bit more than an honest broker. I want to be a catalyst in this and bring them together to resolve the issues.
<P>
"It is my hope that we can get to a position where we can amend the regulations without disturbing the basis of the Clothier agreement."
<P>
Mr Malone has asked his officials to meet on a formal basis with PSNC to discuss the details of what might be contained in any regulation change.
<P>
<H5><B>Second chance for Humber side pharmacy</B></H5>
Humberside contractors have once again been granted the right to open a pharmacy in the village of Holme-on-Spalding Moor.
<P>
The first successful application by Crump & Watson was overturned, following a judicial review against Humberside Family Health brought by the local dispensing doctor practice, Drs Moore, Marsden and Robinson (C&amp;D December 23/30, 1995, p910). 
<P>
The FHSA was told to reconsider the application, in the light of whether the pharmacy was necessary or desirable, by Justice Potts in December. The contract was granted last week.
<P>
Humberside Local Pharmaceutical Committee secretary David Newton says he is pleased that the FHSA has made the same decision, "but I am disappointed that the changeover period is still two years".
<P>
This was echoed by the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee's secretary, Mike King. "This effectively means the pharmacy has to provide a pharmaceutical service for this period, without any prescriptions," he says.
<P>
He believes the FHSA's decision, in this regard, is "not justified", as it is possible for GPs to transfer their list within a shorter  timeframe.

<H3><B>Advanced Photo System launched</B></H3>
<P>
The Advanced Photo System has been launched worldwide. Kodak, Fuji, Minolta, Nikon and Canon have worked together for over five years to develop APS, a system combining digital technology with a newly-formulated silver halide film. 
<P>
APS incorporates a digital memory layer on a 24mm film which is able to record data, such as lighting conditions, number of prints to be made, and the time and place the photo was taken. This information is then used by the D&P machines and remains on the negative for reprints. Negatives are returned in the film canister as an index print, showing all the prints supplied on one sheet. Cameras are able to take prints in three formats, including panoramic, on the same film. 
<P>
APS is also seen as the stepping stone to digital imaging, which will allow photographs to be displayed on home computer screens. 
<P>
The specialist press has welcomed the launch, but is waiting to see the results of pictures before fully endorsing the system. However, initial impressions are favourable and the general opinion is that APS is here to stay.
<P>
The launch of APS is expected to add over 100 million to the 1 billion photo market in the first year, with between 500,000 and 1 million consumers buying into the system. 
<P>
Prices have not been revealed by all manufacturers, but Kodak says its Advantix camera prices will range between 59.99 and 169.99 and film between 3.79 and 5.79. Kodak says it is spending over 10m this year in its publicity campaign. 
<P>
There has been some dissent, however. Amateur photographers have been aware of the system for over four years, but the news embargo has not allowed informed opinion. Others cannot understand why the industry is spending so much money promoting APS when affordable, high-quality digital imaging is not far off.
<P>
Kodak counters this, saying APS is the stepping stone between photography as it is now and digital imaging. Fuji has introduced a digital imaging workstation as part of its APS range.
<P>
Film is being launched in 100, 200 and 400 ASA speeds, with 15, 25 and 40 exposures. Professional quality prints and transparencies may be launched towards to the end of the year.
<P>
The eight selling features of APS that Kodak's Henri Petit, vice president and general manager, listed are:
<UL>
<LI>picture quality
<LI>portability 
<LI>reduced loading problems 
<LI>a choice of three picture formats, classic (C), panorama (P) and the new H format, between the two
<LI>the ability to change film cartridges mid-way through shooting and reload them without losing any exposures
<LI>no need to handle or see the negatives as they are returned in the film cartridge
<LI>an index print of the film is provided with each set of prints allowing easier re-ordering
<LI>data can be recorded on the film and the back of prints, such as lighting conditions, number of copies to be printed, etc.

<H3><B>Pharmacy Update: first MCQs with this week's issue</B></H3>
<P>
This week's issue contains a multiple choice question paper for pharmacists who want to test their knowledge and retention of facts carried in Pharmacy Update articles published in January.
<P>
The Pharmacy Update continuing education programme is supported by Johnson & Johnson MSD, the new trading name of Centra Healthcare and Janssen Pharmacy Division. 
<P>
Pharmacy Update is carried in the first and third issues of Chemist &amp; Druggist every month. C&amp;D is accredited by the College of Pharmacy Practice as a provider of continuing education, and a number of Update articles each month will be accredited under the CPP scheme and carry its logo.
<P>
In the second week of the following month, a question paper will allow pharmacists to test their learning of these accredited articles. Over the course of 12 months, Pharmacy Update will carry at least 30 hours of CPP-accredited learning material.
<P>
This is sufficient to allow C&amp;D's pharmacist subscribers to meet the 30 hours a year of continuing education recommended by their professional body, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society.
<P>
Pharmacists who wish to have their answers to each Update module independently marked and certificated can register to use C&amp;D's interactive telephone marking service. The cost of this service is 12.50 (plus 2.19 VAT). This will allow access, via a personal identification number (PIN) to all CPP accredited modules published during 1996. Full details on how to register can be found on the question paper inserted in this week's issue.
<P>
For subscribers who have mislaid articles and wish to "catch up", back copies of all accredited articles are available on a faxback service on 0891 444791. Dial this number from your fax machine using the handset or polling mode and listen to the instructions.
<P>
Certificates will be issued to pharmacists who have registered to use the telephone marking service twice a year, indicating the number of modules passed by the end of July, 1996, and January, 1997.
<P>
If you wish to know more about the Pharmacy Update continuing education programme, please contact Marianne Mac Donald on 01732 364422 ext 2688.

<H3><B>Baby milk reassurance</B></H3>
<P>
Manufacturers gave their reassurance this week that infant formulae are safe, despite press reports claiming they contain chemicals which impair fertility in animals. The reports said that phthalates, used to soften plastics, had been found in leading brands of baby milk.
<P>
 The Infant and Dietetic Foods Association confirms that phthalates have been found in all the milks tested, but at levels within the official tolerable daily intakes. 
<P>
The Department of Health says the amounts were unlikely to harm humans, while the Health Visitors' Association and the National Childbirth Trust are advising mothers not to change brands as this is not good infant feeding practice.
<P>
 IDFA spokesperson Helena Charlton says phthalates ''are likely to be present in breast milk, too, so mothers should not be made to feel guilty for bottlefeeding''. A spokesperson for Milupa says that if mothers are still worried after speaking to pharmacists or other health professionals, they could telephone the company for further reassurance.
<P>
The Royal Pharmaceutical Society's public relations department had several calls from anxious pharmacists this week. The callers were advised to reassure mothers there was no reason to stop using products, as official thinking was that they were safe. But, because so many pharmacists feel they ''didn't have the whole picture'', their concerns will be put before next week's Council meeting

<H3><B>Malone defends doctor dispensing</B></H3>
<P>
The health minister, Gerald Malone, has defended doctors' right to dispense. In an article in the Dispensing Doctors' Association Journal, which details a meeting between Mr Malone and the chairman of the DDA, Dr David Roberts, over the so-called Clothier 'loophole', the health minister is said to have ''promised to defend the right of doctors to dispense''.
<P>
Mr Malone also conceded that it was a ''fair argument'' that all doctors should be granted dispensing rights and that all patients should have access to a doctor dispensing service.
<P>
While Dr Roberts reports that the loophole situation has not been clarified, even though he pointed out to Mr Malone that there were no wider issues which would improve general medical services if the loophole was not closed, he says he does feel more positive about the future of doctor dispensing.

<H3><B>Non-compliance subject of consultation document</B></H3>
<P>
Why patients fail to take their medication comes under the microscope in a Royal Pharmaceutical Society consultation document issued this week. Medicine non-compliance results in avoidable illness and waste of NHS resources, says the Society, which is calling for the views of those who take, make, prescribe, dispense and manage medicines on how the issue can be addressed.
<P>
The magnitude and complexity of the problem is discussed in the document 'Partnership in medicine taking: taking medicines to best effect', with failure to communicate, particular beliefs and cultures cited as potential reasons for non-compliance. 
<P>
The importance of partnership between patient and professional is crucial, says the document, which defines non-adherence as ''the failure to establish a therapeutic partnership between patients and health professionals''.
<P>
Society president Ann Lewis stresses the partnership theme: ''We urgently need to find a way forward, built on partnerships that respect patients' views and choices, while helping ensure that patients get the best out of their medicine.''
<P>
Professor Marshall Marinker, chairman of the multi-professional working party that produced the document, says a higher priority will be put on patients' views.
<P>

<H3><B>High Court rules shopping mall is a neighbourhood</B></H3>
<P>
Shopping centres can still be 'neighbourhoods', entitled to be served by their own pharmacies, London's High Court has ruled.
Justice Tucker's decision in a test case brought by Boots the Chemists (see May 25) will ease the way for pharmacies to open in out of town shopping malls, and will be viewed with dismay by High Street pharmacies.
<P>
Boots took the Avon Family Health Services Authority to court over its refusal to allow it to establish an outlet in the Cribbs Causeway Regional Shopping Centre, which is opening five miles outside Bristol next year.
<P>
The FHSA's appeal committee decided in May that, as the shopping centre would have no residential element, there was no 'neighbourhood'.
<P>
Striking down that decision, Justice Tucker said: ''I have reached a clear finding that shopping centres can indeed constitute neighbourhoods.''
<P>
The judge ordered the appeal committee to reconsider Boots' application, but the company must still prove its planned store is 'necessary and desirable'. Shoppers are expected to visit the centre from a radius of up to 50 miles, and High Street pharmacies fear that their trade may be seriously affected if Boots is allowed to open its store.
<P>
But the judge said that the appeal committee's finding that shoppers travelling to Cribbs Causeway could just as conveniently obtain their needs from pharmacies in their own residential areas at the same times of day was ''irrational''. Justice Tucker, overturning the appeal committee's decision, ordered the FHSA to pay the action's legal costs and refused it leave to appeal.

<H3><B>SB ranks third in world OTC sales</B></H3>
<P>
Smithkline Beecham Consumer Health is rated as the world's third-largest manufacturer of OTC products, following AHP and Johnson & Johnson, according to Datamonitor in the latest of its Counter Intelligence Service reports. 
<P>
The profile records an SB/Sterling Health OTC business turn-over of $1.76 billion in 1995 and that the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory Relifex (nabumetone) is the most significant product in the company's pipe-line for switching medicines from Prescription only to OTC status. 
<P>
Although the $413 million a year product enjoys patent exclusivity for rheumatoid arthritis past the year 2000, prices may be under pressure as more generic versions of similar products come into the market place. 
<P>
Margins on the consumer healthcare business were 16 per cent in 1995. The company is therefore likely to reach its self-imposed target of a 20 per cent margin in this sector by the end of 1997.
<P>
Datamonitor believes the fundamentals of SB's business to be strong enough to ride out short-term financial problems. Attention in the investment community has focused on its negative cash-flow, and a long-term debt has increased to $3bn. 
<P>
A provision for restructuring was also set aside at the end of 1995. The report suggests that the company is set for continuing restructuring as management attempts to cut down on the duplication of resources. Datamonitor. Tel: 0171 625 8548.

<H3><B>Antibiotic use will grow</B></H3>
<P>
The rise in respiratory infections and the selective usage of premium-priced products is set to fuel growth in the antibiotics market, says a new report. Increasing life expectancy will be accompanied by more episodes of infections among the elderly, says the report 'The European market for antibiotics' to be published by Frost & Sullivan marketing consultancy in mid-July. 
<P>
Broad-spectrum penicillins, macrolides, tetracyclines, and some cephalosporins and quinolones are expected to benefit most from the trend. The market is expected to grow from a 1995 value of $5,144 million to $7,070m by 2001.
<P>
The report says that there is a trend to use the older broad-spectrum antibiotics as standard treatment for common infections, with the newer more expensive broad-spectrum agents for second-line use.
<P>
The report sees positive annual growth rates for all the leading antibiotic categories, except the aminoglycosides, which are ''almost everywhere in slow decline''. 
<P>
The leading antibiotic brand in 1994/5 was Bayer's Ciproxin (ciprofloxacin), followed by Smithkline Beecham's Augmentin (co-amoxiclav) and Roche's Rocephin (ceftriaxone), says the report. The cephalosporins dominate the market and are valued at $1,482m in 1994/5, followed by broad-spectrum penicillins ($1,085m) and macrolides ($811m).
<P>

<H3><B>IBS: suffering in silence</B></H3>
<P>
Almost a third of people with irritable bowel syndrome suffer for five years before a diagnosis is made and only a third are diagnosed within a year of experiencing symptoms. This is according to a Relaxyl survey launched to coincide with IBS Awareness Week (June 3-9).
<P>
The postal survey of almost 850 sufferers found that, prior to diagnosis, the majority (42 per cent) relied on indigestion remedies to relieve symptoms, while only 10 per cent were taking an antispasmodic. However, after diagnosis, the use of indigestion remedies, laxatives, painkillers and anti-diarrhoeals all fell, and the use of prescription medicines (including antispasmodics), fibre and bulking agents went up. 
<P>
Stress was found to be the biggest cause of IBS, cited by two-thirds of respondents. The majority of people in the younger age group (15-44 years) also blamed stress. 
<P>
IBS had social implications as well. More than one-third had taken time off work because of symptoms, the majority using excuses, such as stomach upset and migraine, rather than admitting to having the condition. Two-thirds said they had had to cancel social engagements, and half said it had affected their sex lives. 
<P>
Respondents generally felt embarrassed talking about IBS and over half found the symptoms themselves embarrassing. Over 2.5 million people have been diagnosed by their general practitioner as suffering from IBS and as many as one in three adults are thought to have suffered from symptoms at some point in their lives.
<P>
 Posters promoting IBS Week for display in pharmacies can be found in this week's Chemist & Druggist.

<P>
The Royal Pharmaceutical Society's president, Ann Lewis, has romped home in first place in this year's Council candidate elections, prompting suggestions that she be allowed to stand for an unprecedented third term. Ms Lewis has served two terms as president and is due to step down from the post this year.
<P>
The other five Council members standing for re-election were also successful, elected in the following order: Hemant Patel, David Allen, Geoffrey Booth, Ian Caldwell and Alan Nathan. David Coleman's decision not to stand for re-election ensured one new face on Council: community pharmacist Pat Hoare, who has stood unsuccessfully for the previous four years

<H3><B>PSNC rejects 3 per cent offer</B></H3>
<P>
A slight improvement in the global sum offer, a rise to 3 per cent, has been rejected by the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee. The PSNC has now written to the health secretary, Stephen Dorrell, to request a meeting with him.
<P>
The Department of Health confirmed it was raising its offer to 3 per cent at a plenary meeting on May 9. The initial offer of 2.5 per cent was increased to 2.8 per cent in March, but was rejected by PSNC on two grounds:
<P>
the number of prescriptions dispensed is predicted to increase by 3 per cent, but the DoH offer gives nothing over and above inflation 
<P>
the offer could not be compared to other health sectors, as 2.8 per cent represented gross. The net amount would be much lower, taking into account other factors affecting contractors.
<P>
''There seems little scope for further improvements from DoH officials,'' the PSNC warns local pharmaceutical committees.

<H3><B>Boots' Bristol battle hits the High Court</B></H3>
<P>
Boots the Chemists, battling for the right to open a pharmacy to serve shoppers at a new regional shopping centre to open on the outskirts of Bristol next year, last week took the fight to London's High Court.
<P>
Boots has run into trouble with the local family health services authority, which says that the area is already ''well served'' by pharmacists. The Boots' store would be an ''over-provision of pharmacies in the area, upsetting a delicate balance'', the FHSA claims.
<P>
Boots first applied to open the store in June, 1994, but its appeal was dismissed last May. The company's counsel, Judith Beale, claimed in the High Court that the FHSA had been wrong in its interpretation of the NHS regulations .
<P>
She argued that the self-combined shopping centre and its immediate locality could be described as a 'neighbourhood', and was entitled to be served by its own pharmacy. But the FHSA's counsel, Keith Freeman, said shoppers were expected to come to Cribbs Causeway from a 50-mile radius, and a Boots' store could damage the business of local pharmacies. Justice Tucker reserved his decision.

<H3><B>Zero discount items go 'automatic'</B></H3>
<P>
Pharmacists will no longer have to endorse prescriptions 'ZD' for about two-thirds of the items on the existing zero discount list. The Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee has agreed a proposed 'automatic' list with the Department of Health. A start date has yet to be decided. Included are all the insulin preparations, and most of the fridge and high-cost items.
<P>
Contractors should endorse all ZD items until the Drug Tariff has been updated and the official go-ahead is given. ''The PSNC has reserved its position on the non-listed items. We have agreed a starter list and will be reviewing the manual ZD residue,'' says PSNC chairman Wally Dove. Desmospray is one item not included on the automatic list

<H3><B>High Court supports FHSA over Dunnington pharmacy</B></H3>
<P>
An application by eight North Yorkshire dispensing doctors to block the opening of a new pharmacy in Dunnington was dismissed in the High Court on Wednesday. Dr Michael Wilson and his partners claimed the pharmacy would force closure of their practice and would have a dire impact on the provision of healthcare in the area.
<P>
However, Justice Carnwath commented that: ''It is not part of the scheme of the regulations, or indeed of the Statute, that pharmaceutical services should be relied upon to provide financial underpinning of medical services.''
<P>
The judge ruled that the North Yorkshire Family Health Services Authority had been ''entirely correct'' last July to allow Elliot Goran's new pharmacy to open in the 3,000-resident village.As Mr Goran, who has a shop in nearby Badger Hill, is already on the pharmaceutical list, the FHSA had not been required to consider the potential 'prejudice' the new pharmacy might cause to local medical services.
<P>
There was no convincing policy reason for the distinction between pharmacists who were on the list and those who were not, but the regulations as they stood were ''unambiguous'', the judge said. Dr Wilson and partners claimed they had been denied ''natural justice'' - they had not been allowed to fully argue their case: that Mr Goran's shop was neither 'necessary or desirable'. The GPs were ordered to pay the FHSA's legal costs and were refused leave to appeal.

<P>
The NHS Executive is to issue revised guidance on joint disease management schemes between the NHS and companies, and is advocating local pilots and evaluation.  The guidance is expected to give the go-ahead for such schemes providing they comply with a series of requirements. 
<P>
An NHS Executive letter published in December, 1994, (EL-(94)94) made it clear to companies that no such deals were possible until there had been further talks. This embargo is due to be cancelled on June 8 and the Executive has issued a consultation paper which proposes a framework for NHS participation in such ventures.
<P>
The Executive is meeting the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry and has asked it to consider drawing up an industry code of practice for disease management schemes. The ABPI has been told such schemes should be piloted and evaluated locally rather than be determined nationally

<H3><B>Pharmacy opens its doors to parliament</B></H3>
<P>
A party of MPs saw what really goes on in the pharmacy world when it visited the National Pharmaceutical Association headquarters last week. The All Party Parliamentary Retail Industry Group met the NPA's chairman, Peter Jenkins, and director, Tim Astill, to see the work of the Association and to get a better insight into some of the many problems facing independent retailers.
<P>
The informal meeting and buffet lunch allowed the subjects of out of town shopping centres, the importance of the specialist retailer and the growing threat from the larger multiples to be discussed. ''It is always useful to talk informally to MPs - especially when they serve on parliamentary groups which are relevant to our members,'' says Mr Jenkins. ''As a trade body representing pharmacy owners, the NPA is uniquely placed to voice the retailing pressures and concerns facing its members.''
<P>
''The group showed particular interest in our strategies to counteract the threat from the Office of Fair Trading to abolish Resale Price Maintenance on proprietary medicines,'' comments Mr Astill.

<H3><B>Manpower problem triggers overseas recruitment</B></H3>
<P>
Difficulty in filling pharmacist positions is prompting companies to look overseas to recruit candidates. Director of Provincial Pharmacy Locum Services Mark Koziol's solution to the perceived dearth of UK pharmacists is to set up a transfer scheme for Australian and New Zealand pharmacists to practise over here. In a deal with the largest pharmacy employment agencies in each country, Ravens Pharmacy Service (RPS) in Australia and the New Zealand Employment Agency (NZEA), PPLS will provide training in UK regulations and organise immigration for pharmacists vetted by RPA and NZEA.
<P>
Pharmacists who meet requirements will come to the UK and work as locums for PPLS for normal agency fees. However, all foreign pharmacists must work alongside a UK pharmacist for four weeks. Mr Koziol is keen to recruit employers who would be willing to have overseas pharmacists working as a dispensing assistant or technician for half the hourly rate of a pharmacist, with agency fees waived. 
<P>
PPLS will also offer a reciprocal arrangement for UK pharmacists keen to practise in Australia and New Zealand.Multiples are also targeting foreign pharmacists. Roger Cotton, Moss Chemists' personnel executive, says he has granted three work permits with a further four in the pipeline. Hills Pharmacies has also employed two overseas pharmacists. 
<P>
Roger Odd, head of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society's practice division, is surprised to find companies are going for the overseas option,''bearing in mind there are more people now registered as pharmacists''. But he adds that the Society is not complacent on this issue and is undertaking a series of meetings with the larger companies to discuss the problem, the latest of which is this week. 
<P>
The Society's secretary and registrar, John Ferguson, adds that it recognises present concerns, but says the reasons for the difficulties are not immediately apparent. ''We intend to find out,'' he says.
<P>
Mr Koziol believes the Society could help overseas recruitment by encouraging the Department of Education and Employment to waive the necessity for a work permit, which would require the Society to submit a business plan. 
<P>
He has written to Mr Ferguson, asking for help in this matter. Mr Ferguson says it is ''one of the issues that we are looking at in relation to the fallow year''.

<H3><B>Plans for Yorkshire 'super-pharmacy'</B></H3>
<P>
A Sheffield pharmacy consortium is asking independent pharmacists to form a 'super-pharmacy'. Martin Bennett, managing director of Associated Chemists (Wicker), has written to 40 pharmacists in the area with the intention of setting up a network capable of offering a range of professional services that would otherwise be prohibitive to a single pharmacy. 
<P>
Mr Bennett is responding to the challenge of Nicholas Bosanquet, professor of health policy at Imperial College, who has called for 'super-pharmacies' networked with community pharmacies to offer local services backed up by specialist advice available from a central pharmacy. ''When looking at new role developments, there are problems of time, space and expenses involved. For small pharmacies it would be impossible to offer new services,'' says Mr Bennett.''If we don't do this, the large multiples will do it for us, as they have the resources,'' he warns. 
<P>
The new group would concentrate on providing professional services, with no plans for it to be a buying group. Mr Bennett believes that the more independent pharmacies that join, the better the network will be. ''The more money that is put into the group, the stronger the business,'' he says. 
<P>
The 'Wicker' pharmacy organisation was set up in 1951 by 45 independent pharmacists to provide a central extended pharmacy service. Mr Bennett wants to build on this consortium experience, which he thinks ''could be developed to form the 'hub and spoke' network of the future''.

<H3><B>Labour MP initiates RPM motion</B></H3>
<P>
The Labour Party has pledged its support for Resale Price Maintenance with the launch of a 'Save local chemists' petition. Nigel Griffiths, Labour's consumer affairs spokesperson, initiated the petition after discussions with the National Pharmaceutical Association. 
<P>
''We are concerned that any action by the Office of Fair Trading does not put local chemists at risk,'' says Mr Griffiths. The petition, devised with NPA input, reads:''We the undersigned note that the Office of Fair Trading is considering the future of non-prescription items and record our concern about the future viability of local pharmacies. These are a much-valued community asset and we request that no action is taken by the Government which might jeopardise the future of our local chemists.''
<P>
 Mr Griffiths is writing to Labour MPs asking them to target small independent pharmacies with the petition. However, he admits that it is not currently Labour's policy to overturn any OFT recommendation. The NPA's director, Tim Astill, welcomes the move, believing the more it can be demonstrated that RPM has public support the stronger the case for retention. 
<P>
Liverpool Local Pharmaceutical Committee chairman Jeremy Clitherow has distributed copies to LPC members.''I am urging all pharmacists to elicit the support of their patients. The message is 'use it before you lose it','' he says. Any LPCs seeking copies of the petition forms should contact Mr Clitherow on 0151 228 3262, or request them from Mr Griffiths' office at the House of Commons. Completed forms must be returned to Mr Griffiths' office by mid-August.

<H3><B>MP names pharmacy in methadone motion</B></H3>
<P>
A pharmacist has been accused of deplorable behaviour in dispensing methadone to drug addicts by London Labour MP Ken Livingstone. A motion, tabled by Mr Livingstone in the House of Commons, alleges that E Maguire Chemist in North Paddington is encouraging drug addicts to deal in drugs prescribed by local private practice GPs.
<P>
The motion alleges that the pharmacy ''is prepared to dispense controlled drugs at these levels [between 200-500mg daily of injectable methadone] and offer credit to addicts requiring it''.  
<P>
The motion also calls for the Royal Pharmaceutical Society to urgently review its Code of Ethics to ''curb the practices of pharmacists in relation to the dispensing of controlled drugs''. 
<P>
The pharmacy's proprietor, Shirley Davies, did not respond to these accusations before <EM>C&D</EM> went to press. The Royal Pharmaceutical Society said it had no comment to make.

<H3><B>GW agency to change</B></H3>
<P>
Glaxo Wellcome is planning to fundamentally change its controversial agency scheme within the next few months, perhaps in the new year, according to <EM>C&D </EM>sources. The revised scheme could be similar to that run by Numark, which would make it more user-friendly for both wholesalers and retailers. 
<P>
Glaxo might decide to cut the agency scheme's excessive ad-ministrative costs, which are inflated by extra paperwork, such as the separate invoices wholesalers need to process Glaxo's products. Such a move would prove popular with wholesalers and retailers, particularly because the costs are far higher than those of traditional wholesaling groups.
<P>
Meanwhile, Glaxo is said to be planning to integrate Wellcome's products into the scheme, except for selected lines, such as the 'zero discount' and refrigerated products.Over the past three months, a working party, with members from Glaxo and the British Association of Pharmaceutical Wholesalers, has been examining other trading options.
<P>
Glaxo, however, denies it has decided on any changes. It admits it has discussed integrating Wellcome's products and incorporating the agency discounts into wholesalers' discount structures, but stresses that these are just a few of the trading options it has been evaluating with the BAPW. It will not comment on what other options are available and it denies the revised scheme will be similar to that of Numark.
<P>
''No decision has been made about the scheme being like Numark's. We're having ongoing discussions with the BAPW to see how we could work more smoothly,'' comments a Glaxo spokesman. The company adds that it is too early to say when an announcement could be made on proposed changes to the scheme.

<H3><B>European Court backs Merck and SB in PI battle</B></H3>
<P>
Merck & Co and Smithkline Beecham have won a preliminary victory in the European Court of Justice in the fight to prevent parallel imports from Spain and Portugal. In a preliminary opinion given last month, Neil Fennelly, an advocate general, said that the two companies' patents gave them the right to block exports of their drugs from other European Union countries. 
<P>
If Mr Fennelly's opinion is upheld by the European Court, importers will not be allowed to bring low-priced Merck and SB drugs from Spain and Portugal  into the UK. Merck says Mr Fennelly's announcement signals a potential landmark change for the protection of pharmaceutical patents, R&D and industrial policies in the European Union. 
<P>
''A positive ruling ... will underscore the importance of intellectual property rights in the community, which are vital to the research-based pharmaceutical industry and to medical advance,'' says Per Wold-Olsen, Merck & Co's president of human health in Europe. 
<P>
SB agrees and says it is heartened by Mr Fennelly's opinion. It declines to comment further until the case is resolved. 
<P>
John Barker, chairman of the Association of Pharmaceutical Importers, says the European Court's final ruling is not a foregone conclusion. ''While I understand the howls of glee from our research-based colleagues, there is no guarantee that the court will find in favour of the advocate general's ruling,'' he says.
<P>
''Quite frankly, I would be very surprised if the court goes against Article 30 of the Treaty of Rome, which enshrines the free movement of goods within member states,'' he adds.
<P>
The European Court has never overturned a previous ruling, he says, so it is unlikely to reverse its judgment on Merck versus Stephar, 1981, in which the court ruled that once a drug had been launched in one EU country, the patent holder no longer had patent rights to it. 
<P>
Last December, the European Commission rejected the demands of ten member states, including the UK, to extend the ban on pharmaceutical imports from Spain and Portugal (<EM>C&D</EM> December 23/30, 1995, p925). 
<P>
MSD, Glaxo Wellcome and Organon are all currently appealing against the Commission's decision.

Glaxo Wellcome is confident it has strong grounds to appeal against a court ruling that companies are allowed to launch products similar to Zantac, GW's lucrative anti-ulcer drug, in the US.
<P>
 A US district court judge had ruled that Novopharm, a Canadian company, was entitled to market a generic form of ranitidine hydrochloride in the States, although Glaxo had argued that Novopharm's proposed drug infringed its patent on ranitidine hydrochloride.
<P>
 The patent expires at the end of July. 
<P>
Ranitidine hydrochloride is the active ingredient in Zantac, which is said to be the world's most widely-prescribed drug. Its world-wide sales amount to 2.2 billion, 1.3bn of which are in the US. Zantac accounts for 24 per cent of Glaxo Wellcome's total sales.
<P>
The court's ruling allows drugs similar to Zantac to be sold in the US from August. Glaxo has yet to decide whether to take its case to the US Court of Appeals.

<H3><B><A NAME="a"></A>Door opened for cheap Iberian parallel
imports</B></H3>

<P>
The European Commission has refused to extend the ban on pharmaceutical
imports from Spain and Portugal, opening the way for UK wholesalers
to take advantage of lower prices obtaining in the Iberian States.
<P>
The right to ban imports was granted to European countries for
three years from 1992 when Spain and Portugal introduced patent
protection, but the Commission does not feel the potential surge
in parallel imports will cause the pharmaceutical industry sufficient
difficulties to warrant protective measures being continued.
<P>
The British industry is concerned that research and development
may suffer if sales are affected by imports, but wholesalers are
expected to provide their customers with PIs if they are significantly
cheaper - even at the risk of souring relationships with manufacturers.
<HR>

<H3><B><A NAME="b"></A>Glaxo Wellcome disposes of OTC interests</B>
</H3>

<P>
Glaxo Wellcome is selling its OTC interests in the Warner Wellcome
joint venture to Warner-Lambert. GW is also restructuring its
own joint venture with Warner-Lambert for the marketing of its
own prescription to OTC-sale switches.
<P>
The disposal includes the rights to Actifed, Sudafed and Calpol,
but excludes Zovirax which will be handled by the restructured
GW/Warner-Lambert. The joint venture will continue to co-market
other products in the UK, including Beconase and Zantac.<HR>

<H3><B><A NAME="c"></A>RPSGB briefs pharmacists on RPM</B></H3>

<P>
The Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain is highlighting
key points in the resale price maintenance debate in a briefing
document sent to Branch officials last week. The aim is to ensure
that pharmacists understand the importance of maintaining RPM
on medicines, which range from the threat to the viability of
some local pharmacies to a reduced choice of brands for the consumer.
<HR>

<H3><B><A NAME="d"></A>GSL clotrimazole for athlete's foot</B>
</H3>

<P>
Clotrimazole for athlete's foot and small packs of ibuprofen will
be classified as General Sale List medicines from January 1, 1996.
From December 29, 1995, carbaryl is prescription only, and budesonide
is a P medicine for the prevention and treatment of hayfever (see
issue for details of dosages, pack sizes etc).
<P>
A series of Regulations issued just before Christmas also affect
choline bitartrate, equisetum, magnesium alginate and capsicum
oleoresin for external use (all GSL); the GSL dosage of folic
acid, and compound tincture of benzoin. POM restrictions apply
to amorolfine HCl, calcipotriol, lodoxomide trometamol and pancreatin.
<HR>

<H3><B><A NAME="e"></A>Temazepam blacklisting goes ahead</B></H3>

<P>
The Department of Health has confirmed that the blacklisting of
temazepam capsules will go ahead on January 1 as scheduled (see
&quot;Pick of Last Week&quot;). But pharmacists will not have
to implement safer storage requirements until April 18, the Home
Office has conceded.
<P>
The Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee had argued for
a 15-month transition period on storage and claims pharmacists
are &quot;physically incapable of complying with the Regulations.&quot;
<HR>

<H3><B><A NAME="f"></A>Pharmacy Healthcare Scheme funding threatened</B>
</H3>

<P>
The Pharmacy Healthcare Scheme may lose funding of up to &#163;300,000
if it is unsuccessful in a recent Department of Health tender
for the provision of health promotion services.
<P>
The Scheme, which provides up to 12 health promotion leaflets
a year for the public through pharmacies in England and Wales,
may be forced to seek industry sponsorship if its bid fails. It
faces competition for the work from the Health Education Authority
and a number of other health agencies.
<P>
Roger Odd, the Royal Pharmaceutical Society's head of practice
who runs the Scheme, hope to get continuing funding from the DoH
whatever the outcome.<HR>

<H3><STRONG>Gehe and Unichem increase bids for Lloyds</STRONG></H3>

Gehe, the German wholesaler, has topped Unichem's increased and final offer for the Lloyds Chemists chain. Last Wednesday Gehe offered 500p in cash for Lloyds ordinary shares, a figure which values the chain at 650m. Unichem increased its cash and shares offer for Lloyds last week and on Wednesday the Unichem bid was worth around 490p a share. 
<P>
Earlier in the week Lloyds had issued a statement advising its shareholders to take no action on the Unichem bid until the board had established whether Gehe intended to increase its original bid. Lloyds had not made a statement as C&D went to press, but given the similarity of the offer prices and the flexibility of the Unichem offer as its share price fluctuates the decision for the Lloyds board on which offer to recommend to shareholders could be a difficult one.

<H3><STRONG>A better offer or no meeting, PSNC warns Department</STRONG></H3>

The Department of Health has to come up with a "substantially improved offer" for 1996/1997 before the Pharmaceutical Service Negotiating Committee will consent to a meeting between the two parties.
<P>
In the latest letter to DoH, the PSNC chairman, David Sharpe, points out that until a better offer than the proposed 2.5 per cent rise in the global sum is made, "there is plainly little point in us meeting".
<P>
The DoH justified its initial offer by suggesting it compares favourably  with the pay increases made to doctors and dentists. The PSNC dismisses this by saying: "How you square that comment with the 3.9 per cent increase in on-cost and fees recommended for dispensing doctors ... on the basis of an assumptions of 'no change in workload'."

<H3>SB has an 'excellent year'</H3>

A 40 per cent rise in new product sales helped SmithKline Beecham  turn in profits for 1995 almost 20 per cent up on 1994.
<P>
The company reported  sales for continuing operations in 1995 of 7 billion, 16 per cent up on 1994. Trading profits grew 19 per cent to 1.47 bn.
<P>
Jan Leschly, SB's chief executive, decribed the results as 'excellent'. 1995 had, he said, been a year of consolidation after the major acquisitions the company made in 1994 and SB has no plans for any major activity or acquisitions during the next year. Leschly remains 'very optimistic' about the company's performance in 1996.
<P>
SB Pharmaceuticals had a good year with sales up 13 per cent to 4.2 bn and trading profit up 14 per cent to 1.1 bn. New products (those launched within the last five years) contributed 1.1 bn to total sales and are growing by 40 per cent.
<P>
Tagamet sales dropped 180m compared to 1994, but Leschly said that the business's excellent results showed that the 'Tagamet issue' was behind the company.
<P>
The consumer healthcare division saw sales rise 35 per cent to 2 bn  with trading profits up 59 per cent at 33m. Excluding the contribution from Sterling sales rose 10 per cent. Margins grew  2.4 per cent to 16.5 per cent and Leschly said that the company was well on target to meet its target of 20 per cent margins by 1998. OTC medicine sales rose 62 per cent.

<H3><STRONG>Patient education campaign expected</STRONG></H3>

The Department of Health is expected to launch a patient education campaign next week to persuade people to only call out doctors in cases of real need.
<P>
The Government-funded campaign, which will be promoted locally by Health Education Authorities, will suggest that people take advice from their pharmacist in the first instance.

<H3><STRONG>NW audit aims to counter Which? criticism</STRONG></H3>

Pharmacists in the north west of England are to fight back over criticisms made in the January Which? report, using a region-wide audit to document over the counter sales of terfenadine. The aim is to run the audit through as many of the regions 1,350 pharmacies as possible.
<P>
The terms of the audit have yet to be decided, but the National Pharmaceutical Association and the audit development fellow for England favour  monitoring requests for named products.
<P>
The facilitator team will provide participating pharmacies a sales protocol to use, with sales refusals and reasons being recorded. 
<P>
Interested pharmacists are asked to phone Roy Lane, audit facilitator for Bolton and Wigan FHSA on 01706 627118.

<H3><STRONG>NI gets CD cabinet pay</STRONG></H3>

Northern Ireland contractors are to receive 127.50 towards the cost of a CD cabinet, following the re-classification of temazepam to Schedule 3.
<P>
The Pharmaceutical Contractors Committee negotiated the deal after a similar deal was made for pharmacies in England and Wales. The one-off fee will be included in contractors' March prescription payment, made at the end of May.

<H3><STRONG>Unilever bids for Helene Curtis</STRONG></H3>

Unilever has bid 488 million for Helene Curtis, the US haircare and personal products company.
<P>
The board of Helen Curtis has recommended that shareholders accept the offer, which values shares at about 44.60. The deal, which will probably be completed by the end of March, seems assured after Unilever struck a deal to buy shares from Ronald Gidwitz, Helene Curtis' president, and other partnerships that represent 29 per cent of the company's shares and 75 per cent of its voting rights.
<P>
Helene Curtis manufactures and markets a range of haircare products, deodorants and other skincare products. The company had sales of 805m, two-thirds of which were in the US, and pre-tax profits of 23m in the year ending 28 February 1995.

<A NAME="a"></A>
<H3><B>Malone's 'listening' report highlights primary team role</B></H3>
<P>
Community pharmacists should become a more integral part of the primary care team, says a consultation document on the future of primary care. 'Primary care: the future', the fruit of health minister Gerald Malone's six-month listening tour, highlights better team working as essential for improving primary care, allowing non-medical professionals, such as pharmacists, to ''fulfil their potential and expand their contribution''. 
<P>
The report suggests a more integrated approach would help avoid problems experienced at the primary/secondary care interface, promote cost-effective prescribing and would allow pharmacists to take on additional tasks, such as managing repeat prescribing and reviewing medication. Another proposal suggests suitably qualified pharmacists taking on the prescribing or dose adjustment roles of GPs.
<P>
The upshot would be that pharmacists would be more widely recognised by patients and other healthcare professionals as the first port of call for advice on common ailments. This could, in turn, increase pharmacy's role in health promotion. The document proposes the setting up of cottage hospitals where a range of healthcare services are amalgamated. Yet while the DoH acknowledges that this would reinforce the teamwork concept, it admits it would be important to retain pharmacies' ready accessibility. 
<P>
But the DoH concedes that such radical changes cannot be accomplished without amending the existing contractual, regulatory and remuneration framework, which only covers medicine dispensing and limited additional roles, such as advice to residential and nursing homes.
<P>
''There are no incentives for going beyond the minimum requirements ... there is no financial recognition for giving advice, making domiciliary visits or providing medication review for elderly patients,'' says the document. It adds that the current remuneration system has ''perverse effects'' with pharmacies sometimes struggling to survive through competition with one another and dispensing doctor practices. Yet if script volume is too high, there may be no time for other activities. 
<P>
It also accepts that another hindrance to expanding the role of pharmacies is the lack of additional resources for premises, equipment, staffing and training. Another restraint is the requirement that pharmacists must be on the premises to supply medicines, preventing services being offered off the premises. 
<P>
A second document, due in the autumn, will outline an agenda for change, with any changes to be tried in voluntary pilots. Next week, Mr Malone is to set off on an 'agenda-setting round' to consider how to implement the ideas in the document. Seminars will be held until the end of July. Copies of the report are available from Health Literature Line on 0800 555777.

<A NAME="b"></A>
<H3><B>Assistant training is now urgent</B></H3>
<P>
There are just two weeks to go before all pharmacy assistants who sell medicines to the public must have started - or already completed - an approved training  course. After June 30, it will be against the Royal Pharmaceutical Society's Code of Ethics for untrained assistants to continue dealing with requests for medicines. 
<P>
But, as with the introduction of  protocols, inspectors will try to be understanding and no draconian measures are expected with the dawn of July 1. The Society's director of legal services, Sue Sharpe, says the inspectorate will act in an advisory capacity, reminding pharmacists of their new obligations. 
<P>
''They will be emphasising that the time has come for pharmacists to ensure their assistants are properly trained,'' she says. ''And there are many excellent courses available.'' She reminds pharmacists that the Society's last multiple choice question paper for experienced assistants will be in November. Registration has already started and the deadline is October 7. 
<P>
Roger Odd, who heads the Society's practice division, believes many pharmacists have yet to act on assistant training. There could be as many as 50,000 assistants, including part-timers, who are involved in selling medicines, but so far only about 5,000 experienced assistants have taken the Society's MCQ papers - and all others should be undertaking accredited training.
<P>
''We urge people to put their names in for the last MCQ exam as quickly as possible, because we know there will be a surge of interest,'' he says.

<H3><B>Counterpart: the cost effective route</B></H3>
<P>
For C&D subscribers the Cambridge Counterpart Pharmacy Assistant Development Programme is the most cost-effective course available. Thanks to the generous sponsorship of Whitehall Laboratories, Counterpart distance learning modules have been free to C&D subscribers.
<P>
Pharmacists who have not yet started their medicine counter assistants on a course are strongly advised to send immediately for a pack of all the Counterpart modules issued to date. Assistants who are already following Counterpart are reminded that they must register with C&D in order to qualify for their CPP certificate. Full details and an order form are on p843 of this week's C&D magazine.

<H3><B>RPSGB Council approves statutory fee hike</B></H3>

The Royal Pharmaceutical Society's Council last week approved increases of about 4 per cent in the statutory fees for next year. The members' full-time retention fee is to rise from 120 to 125 and the premises retention fee from 80 to 83. 
<P>
<STRONG>Rural pharmacy survey</STRONG> The Society is to meet the cost of a proposed survey of rural pharmacy users, in conjunction with the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee. The aim is to obtain evidence on  opening pharmacies in rural areas where there is opposition from a dispensing doctor's surgery.
<P>
<STRONG>Competition law</STRONG> The Society has replied to a Department of Trade & Industry consultation document on competition law reform. The response set out in detail the reasons for retaining Resale Price Maintenance. It also commented on the difficulties patients were experiencing because the Society felt unable to give guidance on charges for dispensing private prescriptions.
<P>
<STRONG>Employee's needs</STRONG> The community Pharmacists' Group agreed that the office should take forward the recommendations made by a Council working party on the needs of employee pharmacists, which reported in July, 1994. Only one of the 14 recommendations had been implemented. The Committee particularly wished to see action on the recommendation that Council should take account of the interests of the employee pharmacist, in the absence of any independent representative body.
<P>
<STRONG>Marketing pharmacy</STRONG> Council approved further steps aimed at marketing community pharmacy to health authorities. The Society is to encourage local pharmaceutical committees to discuss the future role of community pharmacists with chief executives and members of the new health authorities. The subject will also be raised at a meeting with the National Association of Pharmaceutical Advisors.
<P>
<STRONG>New Age progress</STRONG> Immediate past-president Ann Lewis is to chair the next stage of the Pharmacy in a New Age project. It was envisaged that the project would result in a report on the consultation, an agenda for action and a final strategy.

<H3><B>Dorrell backs recruitment</B></H3>
<P>
Health secretary Stephen Dorrell has acknowledged the need to encourage ''recruitment and retention'' in the primary care sector and would like to see better use made of pharmacists' clinical expertise. He said on Tuesday that developing primary health care should be an exciting and professionally rewarding area in which to work, yet the sector was failing to ''hold its head up'' as far as recruitment was concerned.
<P>
 It was an issue that needed addressing across the health professions, he told a conference in London on 'The future of primary health care'. During the discussion, Cardiff GP Carol Gibbs told Mr Dorrell that if she was expected to manage more patients at home it was essential for her to have good pharmaceutical advice. But she could not direct patients to a specific pharmacy and did not have enough resources to pay for her own clinical pharmacist. 
<P>
Mr Dorrell said the point was ''well taken''. He thought the NHS ''almost unbelievably profligate'' in the way it failed to use the skills of expensively trained professionals like pharmacists. He was in favour of looking at ways to develop these skills.
<P>
The Royal Pharmaceutical Society's deputy secretary, Philip Green, agreed that the NHS should make better use of pharmacists. Pharmacy had a valuable role to play, working as part of the healthcare team rather than in isolation. The reluctance of government to invest in pharmacy had resulted in low morale among pharmacists, he said. There was a need for investment to support developing roles which could improve patient care and use resources more economically.

<A NAME="f"></A>
<H3><B>Pharmacists advise a million people a week</B></H3>
<P>
More than one million people a week are given advice from a community pharmacy, reveals a study of pharmacist advice on over the counter medicines. The study, conducted by the Pharmacy Practice Research Resource Centre in a jointly-funded project with the National Pharmaceutical Association, analysed pharmacists' advice to consumers. 
<P>
Researchers observed four pharmacies in each of three areas (Essex, Nottinghamshire and Lancashire) for two days, with pharmacists recording information for a further week between November and January. The results reveal that just over half of OTC consultations came with advice, with pharmacists involved in 63 per cent of cases and counter assistants in 49 per cent.
<P>
 Nearly two-thirds of advice episodes offered details on the products available, while 46 per cent examined the symptoms, with three-quarters of consultations taking less than two minutes. Customers were more likely to require advice on analgesics (19 per cent) and coughs (18 per cent).
<P>
If the results were extrapolated nationally, an estimated 175,000 people per day are given pharmacy advice, yet the pharmacists surveyed found the biggest hurdle in extending this service lay in consumers being reluctant recipients. 
<P>
Dr Bogusia Temple, research associate at the PPRRC, says: ''We really need to keep making the case for pharmacists as advice givers. Pharmacists are advocating more education [for consumers] on what they do and the value of speaking to them.'' She adds that the other half of the puzzle is in determining consumer perception of this advice.

<H3><B>Practice to People: your chance to shine</B></H3>
<P>
Do you run a pharmacy that offers customers something special in the way of healthcare? Have you worked to develop relations with other members of the primary care team to bring an innovative service to patients? If the answer is 'yes', then the Chemist & Druggist 'Practice To People' awards, sponsored by Glaxo Wellcome, offer you the chance to win a major prize. 
<P>

<H3><B>CPAG responds to OFT</B></H3>
<P>

Personal bankruptcy for pharmacists is one of the many possible outcomes of the removal of Resale Price Maintenance, according to the Community Pharmacists' Action Group. In a document responding to the Office of Fair Trading's consultation paper (C&D August 3, p145), the CPAG says: ''The relative stability of pharmacy numbers in recent years should not be taken as an indicator that pharmacy is a sound, profitable business.''
<P>
In response to the OFT's assertion that ''chemist numbers are not now declining, and have been increasing or stable since 1980'', the CPAG says: ''In 1970, the court found that the removal of RPM would be likely to lead to larger numbers of pharmacies going out of business more quickly than would otherwise be the case. 
<P>
''There are powerful exit barriers facing many owners of small pharmacy businesses. They will have been required to give personal guarantees to creditors and lessors of the business premises, and closure may mean personal bankruptcy. Many independently-owned pharmacies today may be unable to survive any further reduction of income.''
<P>
The OFT consultation paper looked at whether the 1970 judgment allowing RPM on medicines was still valid. The CPAG response refers to over the counter products only, and not with those parts of the 1970 exemption or the OFT paper concerning ethicals. The Group is responding to the OFT's eight points of possible change. ''The OFT has failed to make a case for challenging RPM on non-prescription medicines,'' says CPAG chairman David Sharpe.

<H3><B>MCA raids Pharma-Nord over Melatonin</B></H3>
<P>

The Medicines Control Agency has ordered the seizure of all melatonin products from Pharma-Nord. The Morpeth, Northumberland, company was raided last Wednesday and four enforcement officers searched the premises for the product. Pharma-Nord's managing director, Bent Henriksen, believes the agents took about 1,000 packets of the product away with them.
<P>
Pharma-Nord has challenged the MCA's ruling that melatonin is a drug, and filed a court application against the decision on June 26. The company believes that the substance is a harmless antioxidant and should be freely allowed for sale as a food supplement, as happens in other countries, including the US.
<P>
''A judicial review is pending and for the Agency to act on seizure, as though melatonin was a harmful narcotic, smacks of a heavy-handed approach,'' comments Mr Henriksen. He admits that the company had continued distributing the product until last Wednesday's raid. 
<P>
The company's solicitor, Kenneth Hunt, adds: ''My firm has been in weekly correspondence with the Agency, and it has produced no medical or scientific research to support its recent change of classification.'' An MCA spokesman confirmed that documentation and melatonin were seized from Pharma-Nord. He said that it is the manufacturers, and not the MCA, that have to produce evidence of safety for the licensing of a drug. 
<P>
The MCA ruled that the substance is a medicinal product in November, 1994. The Agency's spokesman added that Pharma-Nord was warned that if it continued to supply melatonin, seizure of the product may take place.

<UL>
<LI> Martindale describes melatonin as a hormone produced in the pineal gland. The substance has been reported to alleviate jet-lag and may have a role in treating sleeping disorders.

<H3><B>Avon LPC criticises local budget system</B></H3>
<P>

Avon Local Pharmaceutical Committee is criticising the Department of Health for insisting that local budgets be fixed on historical spend.  LPC secretary Alaster Rutherford would prefer money allocated for pharmaceutical services to nursing and residential homes based on a capitation system. 
<P>
The call comes as Avon Health Authority announces a series of moves to limit applications for providing pharmaceutical services to the homes. The proposals come into effect on September 1.
<P>
Avon HA is proposing that new applications for providing a service to homes with four or less beds will not be accepted, nor will new applications from contractors presently servicing five or more homes. Contractors with dual registered homes will receive only one payment, paid at the nursing home rate for the total number of beds.
<P>
''We have had an increase of 19 per cent in the number of homes, but no increase in money,'' says Mr Rutherford. ''As it stands, we can never go forward if our historical spend will determine our share of the global sum.'' He adds that the money given to local government for local negotiation should have been 'ring-fenced' at least for one year to identify it for pharmaceutical services.
<P>
Stephen Axon, secretary of the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee, says: ''I will not accept that money is unavailable from the health authority. If they whinge and moan that there is not sufficient money, they should go to their unitary authority.''
<P>
The DoH has made provision with unitary authorities for local negotiation to occur. Mr Axon adds that the local budgeting across the country has varied from an overspend of 90 per cent to underspending.  Avon Health Authority pharmaceutical adviser, Ros Grant, says that the money is devolved from the global sum, but there is no provision made for annual growth in local pharmacy services. ''As a health authority, we are responsible for making every effort to stay in the budget. We do not have extra resource allocations like London, but we have all the same problems.'' She adds that the HA will be raising the issue with DoH shortly.

<H3><B>Final MCA exam</B></H3>
<P>

The Royal Pharmaceutical Society's third and final examination for 'experienced' pharmacy assistants is on November 14. Applications to sit the exam should be made in writing to Room 309, RPSGB, 1 Lambeth High Street, London SE1 7JN. They should state the names of the assistant and the supervising pharmacist, and the name and address of the pharmacy at which the assistants are working. The closing date is October 7. 
<P>
Assistants who narrowly failed the May, 1996, exam will be automatically re-registered. Those who failed by a wide margin have been advised to undertake an approved training course. Exam papers will be despatched on November 11 and should be returned, along with a fee of 10 per candidate. The results of the exam will be despatched by January 3, 1997.

The Medicines Control Agency is proposing to make four additions to the GSL Order. In the consultation letter MLX 227, August 21, the Agency is seeking views on proposals to allow certain substances to be made GSL provided conditions are met. The proposals, if accepted, come into effect by January 31, 1997. 
<P>
The conditions for the products to be sold as GSL medicines are:

<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>Sodium picosulphate - if contra-indicated for children under ten years, it has a maximum strength of 5mg/5ml, it has a maximum single dose and daily dose of 15mg, and the pack contains no more than 60ml of sodium picosulphate solution
<LI> Dequalinium chloride - if indicated to treat minor infections of the mouth and throat, if it has a maximum dose of 0.25mg and a maximum daily dose of 2ml
<LI> Liquid paracetamol preparations for adults and children aged 12 years and above - with a maximum strength of 500mg/20ml (2.5 per cent) and a maximum pack size of 160ml
<LI> Paediatric paracetamol liquid preparation - if it has a maximum strength of 120mg/5ml (2.4 per cent), a maximum dose of 480mg, a maximum daily dose of 1,920mg and it is presented in packs containing no more than 20 sachets, each of which is no more than 5ml

<H3><B>Moss creates training and personnel director</B></H3>
<P>

Moss Chemists, the retail division of Unichem, is splitting the post of retail operations director to enable it to concentrate more on customer care and on the training and welfare of its 3,500 employees. Caryl Webb, the current retail operations director, will head a new department as training and personnel director, starting from September 1. She remains superintendent pharmacist for Moss' stores. The company will appoint a new operations director.
<P>
Mrs Webb says the move is an important one for Moss, regardless of whether Unichem succeeds in acquiring Lloyds Chemists. ''The growth of Moss and the changing emphasis within the NHS towards locally-managed primary care services provide new challenges for the company,'' she says. ''We have concluded that we need to focus on recruiting the right pharmacists for our 400-plus pharmacies and on equipping all staff for the developing healthcare role to which we are fully committed.

<H3><B>Pharmacists should be paid for script interventions</B></H3>
<P>
Pharmacists should be remunerated for the additional work they do in clarifying prescriptions before dispensing them.
<P>
In her report on a study which details the amount of time pharmacists spend in dealing with this issue, pharmacy audit facilitator for St Helens & Knowsley Judith Whittaker says that while pharmacists are pleased to act as a safety net in clarifying prescriptions, the service is not directly remunerated.
<P>
"Pharmacists should be adequately re-imbursed for the hidden, although important, workload involved in dispensing," she says.
<P>
Eighteen pharmacists in St Helens & Knowsley recorded 238 serious or major interventions they had to make over three months, an average of six a month each. The interventions were classed as 'potentially serious' if the prescription would have been dangerous to the patient and 'a major nuisance' if the pharmacist had to contact the prescriber before the prescription could be dispensed. For example, if it was illegible.
<P>
Each intervention took an average of seven minutes to resolve and an average of one local phone call. One quarter of the prescriptions were confirmed by the prescriber to be correct as written, but the pharmacist had thought the contact was necessary. Half were changed in accordance with the pharmacist's advice. There were 16 overdoses, some of which were not immediately obvious but found by the pharmacist's careful vigilance.
<P>
Antibiotics were involved in 29 per cent of the serious interventions, a particular problem being interactions with 4-quinolones and macrolides. Antihistamines were responsible for 12 per cent, particularly interactions with terfenadine. At least 56 per cent of the prescriptions requiring intervention were handwritten. Another problem was the lack of children's ages on prescriptions, which in some cases could have led to them being given aspirin or overdoses.
<P>
The St Helens & Knowsley Pharmacy Audit Advisory Group, which made the study, collaborated with local doctors to allay any fears that it would be seen as a fault-finding exercise.

<H3><B></B>Birmingham pharmacists 'working for excellence'</H3>
<P>
Birmingham pharmacies can take part in a new accreditation scheme which seeks to develop their role in health promotion. Those accredited will receive a one-off payment of 400 and be entitled to display a 'Working for excellence in Birmingham' sticker.
<P>
Pharmacies must have completed the patient medication record course and five other key objectives. One requirement obliges pharmacies to have a consultation area, no more than a tenth of window space covered by stickers and advertisements and no confectionery on the medicines counter (other than medicated items). Medicine counter assistants must also be suitably trained.
<P>
The pharmacist must have completed the CPPE health promotion course and a smoking cessation course organised by the health authority, as well as offering two services from an approved list, which includes needle and syringe exchange, welfare milk and prescription collection and delivery.
<P>
The scheme is being funded by Birmingham Health Authority, with which interested pharmacists must register by June 30. The local pharmaceutical committee is urging contractors to take part.
<P>
"If it is to be successful in its first year and, as a result, give us a more powerful bargaining position when we come to negotiate an extension, we need to ensure as high a level of uptake as possible,'' the LPC officers say in a letter to contractors.

<H3><B>OTC industry looking for new opportunities</B></H3>
<P>
OTC manufacturers in the UK are having to look for new opportunities in a mature market, said Dr Alan Raymond, president of the Proprietary Association of Great Britain, addressing the European Proprietary Medicines Manufacturers Association in Istanbul last week.
<P>
With every major prescription company investing in the OTC sector, to the tune of $104 billion globally, and the POM to P switch procedure established in the UK, the issue now is how to expand the market through volume growth. "The prime goal is to promote responsible consumer healthcare and to do that we need to have the support of Government, doctors, pharmacists and consumers," said Mr Raymond.
<P>
"Pharmacists are clearly in favour of this goal which enables them to play a greater part in the primary healthcare system." So far, the UK has seen twice as many switches in the past three years as there have been in the previous ten.
<P>
But the next real opportunity is the switch of indications, such as the treatment of baldness, eczema, temporary sleeplessness, vaginal candidiasis and arthritic pain. "They offer new OTC marketing opportunities which companies are now taking up."
<P>
The focus now is on influencing doctors and building OTC awareness through the PAGB Directory. "There is a real benefit in saving GP time and Government money. The average cost of an OTC is 2.30, but if a patient takes a cold or minor pain to a doctor it costs our NHS 24  - a ten-fold increase."
<P>
<H3><B>Dutch bypass pharmacies</B></H3>
<P>
Dutch authorities have dropped the Pharmacy only class of medicines, allowing all OTCs to be sold by registered druggists.
<P>
Until this year, the Netherlands had mirrored the British approach: Prescription only, Pharmacy Medicines (semi-ethicals) and OTCs, which could be sold through pharmacies and druggists.
<P>
But to remove the "unfair competition between pharmacists and druggists", said Nico Alberts, vice president of Neprofarm, the Dutch equivalent of the Proprietary Association of Great Britain, there are now only two classes: Prescription and OTC. 
<P>
Although this is still a transitional phase, a number of previously Pharmacy Medicines have moved to OTC, such as non-sedating antihistamines, nicotine patches and acyclovir.
<P>
This should mean market growth of around 9 per cent over the next three years, said Mr Alberts. The impact on pharmacists was not touched upon. Druggists have to update their knowledge by next year.
<P>
"Dutch druggists are proving once again their qualitative role in the distribution of self-medication products next to the pharmacist," concluded Mr Alberts.
<P>
<H3><B>AESGP to open London office</B></H3>
<P>
The AESGP is to open a London Docklands satellite branch next month to strengthen links with the European Medicines Evaluation Association, which also has its offices at Canary Wharf.
<P>
Fernand Sauer, the EMEA's executive director, welcomes the move, which will allow greater contact with the Association. "EMEA has a solid partnership with you," he told delegates at the AESGP's annual conference.

<H3><B>Management buy-out for Wisdom</B></H3>
<P>
The Addis family has sold Wisdom in a management buy-out. The management team is led by Brian McMullen, who has been managing director and chief executive of Wisdom since 1994. He will have a controlling 51 per cent stake in the new company, which he has bought with three other directors, financed by the investment capital group 3i.
<P>
He was unable to disclose the amount paid, only to say that the Independent newspaper's figure of "a little under 15 million" was "badly wrong".
<P>
The buy-out team also includes sales and marketing director Janice Collins, manufacturing director Mike Rudge and financial director Julian Edge-Partington. Paul Woddis, a former managing director of Cussons UK and chief executive of Sanofi UK, is acting as non-executive chairman.
<P>
The Addis Toothbrush Co was formed over 200 years ago. The Wisdom brand was established just after the Second World War and the Wisdom Regular is currently the UK's best-selling toothbrush. The company has over 190 employees.
<P>
Current marketing initiatives, including the introduction of regular triple packs and the Instant Win Scratch Card promotion, aim to encourage people to change their toothbrush every three months rather than the average of once every nine months.

<H3><B>Gehe acquisition was good for AAH figures</B></H3>
<P>
AAH has seen major improvements in performance since its acquisition by Gehe in May, 1995. Operating profits for the nine months to December 31, 1995, were almost the same as for the preceding 12 months (32.9 million compared with 34.6m). Turnover at 1.3 billion was 10 per cent higher than the same nine-month period in 1994. Return on sales was 2.47 per cent.
<P>
Pharmaceutical wholesaling and retail businesses (Hills pharmacies) increased their operating profits by 18.8 per cent to 22.7m and 31.2 per cent to 8.9m respectively in the nine months to December 31, 1995, compared with the same period the previous year (accounting dates have been changed from March to December to bring AAH in line with Gehe).
<P>
David Taylor, the wholesale division's managing director, says a significant amount of business was taken from Unichem. Gehe has contributed to increased efficiency by its expertise in automation and improving warehouse layout. Further rationalisation of the 16 branches is expected, but, he says: "It is easy to close branches but not easy to retain business.'' So careful planning will be necessary. Some 10m has been set aside for this. 
<P>
The wholesale division's turnover increased 14.2 per cent to 1,430.5m in 1995, compared with the 8.5 per cent increase in the overall UK market and the 4.3 per cent shown by Unichem.
<P>
Michael Major, managing director of the retail chain Hills, attributes improvements to organic growth, as well as to acquisitions. There are now over 300 Hills pharmacies. Changes in management information systems and financial control have improved performance of retail and wholesale businesses.
<P>
AAH is still committed to acquiring the Lloyds' chain, but not "determined at any cost", he says. Group finance director Stefan Meister envisages that the same profit success could be achieved, although Lloyds would be a much more difficult company to integrate with Gehe than AAH. Some immediate savings could be achieved, he thought.
<UL>
<LI>Hills' pharmacies have just started a pilot trial of a disease management programme involving patients with diabetes.
<LI>Gehe has sold Schering a 75 per cent stake in Jenapharm, eastern Germany's most profitable pharmaceuticals group. The deal will strengthen Schering's hormone division, particularly fertility control. Gehe's motive is to focus on its core business of wholesaling.

<H3><B>DoH side-steps generics issues</B></H3>
<P>
The situation is rapidly approaching where 50 per cent of prescriptions are being filled generically at less than 20 per cent of the cost of branded equivalents. But Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell has given generics manufacturers little encouragement that their concerns over the delayed introduction of mandatory patient pack dispensing, and erosion of their competitive edge in European markets, will be addressed in the near future.
<P>
There was an understanding that patient packs could be introduced into the NHS at nil cost, he told the British Generic Manufacturers Association last Tuesday. "We now need to clarify how that can be delivered in practice," said Mr Dorrell.
<P>
"In considering how fast we go, I have to assess the risks of extra costs in the proposals that have been made to me. Only when I am satisfied we can deliver the no-cost commitment can the Government proceed."
<P>
Nor would he reveal the Government position over the competition concerns facing generic manufacturers in Europe. Countries outside the European Community allow generic manufacturers to develop products during the patent period for release as soon as the patent expires.
<P>
Such development work is not permitted in Europe. The result, said BGMA chairman Andrew Kaye, is that there is still generic competition the day after the patent expires, but the products come from Canada, the US, Iceland, India, China  - almost anywhere but Europe.
<P>
The differences in legislation between countries distort the market and can have damaging effects on the industry and governments' legitimate efforts to manage their health budgets, argued Mr Kaye.
<P>
He welcomed recent efforts in the Uruguay GATT world trade talks to encourage a more uniform application of patent law internationally. The Community's SPC regulation was a "flawed attempt" to harmonise the period of market exclusivity for proprietary medicines within the European Union.
<P>
He noted that the European Parliament had voted in favour of allowing generic manufacturers to begin development work necessary for product registration during the period of patent protection  - the so-called Roche-Bolar provision in the US. "We simply want to be able to compete equally with non-European generic manufacturers," said Mr Kaye. 
<P>
It is time the Department of Health took action to make patient pack dispensing mandatory. "The DoH committed itself to the necessary changes in terms and conditions of service to ensure that the change to unbroken patient pack dispensing would actually happen," said Mr Kaye.
<P>
"Generic manufacturers are taking considerable commercial risks on the basis of the Department's announcements. Without the promised changes, we shall lose significant amounts of money."
<P>
Manufacturers have invested over 10 million in plant to make the change from bulk to patient packs, but they would be unwise to purchase more new equipment while any uncertainty remains, he said.
<P>
Mr Dorrell predicted a 75 per cent growth in the generic market over the next decade, but cautioned that the DoH needed to recognise the legitimate concerns of generics manufacturers, as well as the branded sector.
<P>
He encouraged the two groups to reach a common agreement on how to proceed in Europe. The interests of generics companies were just as important as those of the R&D-based industry, he assured the BGMA.
<P>
Mr Dorrell said there is a commitment by both industry and the Department to move in the direction of patient packs on the basis that it could be introduced into the NHS at nil cost.

<H3><B>PSNC believes 3.13pc 'is best deal' in the circumstances</B></H3>
<P>

The Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee has reluctantly accepted a 3.13 per cent increase in the global sum for 1996-97. PSNC believes it has got the best possible deal for contractors under the circumstances, but is 'extremely disappointed' that the NHS Executive did not move further towards achieving full reimbursement at an earlier date.
<P>
Chairman Wally Dove said this week: 'We tried every way we knew to increase the global sum. We also worked hard on trying to improve the late payment situation, but none of the proposals the NHSE came up with were acceptable - they all involved strings on the global sum in terms of interest charges.'
<P>
The increase takes the global sum to 692.7 million and PSNC hopes soon to announce details of the new fees and allowances. The target date for implementation is January 1. 
<P>
The PSNC report in this week's Chemist and Druggist includes signing FP10s, oxygen devolvement, further action on RPM and the resignation of Ian McArdle.

<H3><B>RPSGB promotes Fitness to Practise Commons' Bill</B></H3>
<P>
A Bill that seeks to protect the public from pharmacists whose competence is impaired by illness was to be picked up in the House of Commons on Wednesday by Sir Michael Shersby MP. 
<P>
The Royal Pharmaceutical Society is backing the proposed legislation - the Pharmacists (Fitness to Practise) Bill - which would give it powers to suspend from practice pharmacists whose competence is affected by physical or mental ill-health, or drink or drug-related illness, and who have not responded voluntarily to the available support schemes.
<P>
At present, the Society only has powers to act where pharmacists have been found guilty of a criminal offence or serious misconduct. It has long wanted the power to intervene earlier. Secretary and registrar John Ferguson says the Society is delighted that Sir Michael is taking forward 'this much-needed piece of legislation'.
<P>
'In pharmacy, as in any profession, ill-health, physical or mental, needs to be recognised and dealt with sympathetically, and separated completely from matters of discipline.'

<H3><B>Popat granted appeal rights</B></H3>
<P>

A pharmacist has obtained a High Court injunction preventing Leicester Health from holding an open hearing at which dispensing doctors were to apply for a contract for a body corporate pharmacy. The pharmacist is challenging the fact that she would have no right to appeal if the contract was granted.
<P>
Shital Popat, who has a pharmacy in Leicester, applied in May to open six new businesses in villages where patients receive medicines from dispensing doctors. Only three of these businesses are now being pursued. 
<P>
The doctors in four of the six areas then formed a body corporate pharmacy in which they were shareholders and applied for a contract. Both the GPs' and Mrs Popat's applications were due to be heard on Monday, but, if the contract had been granted to the GPs, Mrs Popat would have had no right to appeal. 
<P>
Leicester Health claimed that a pharmacist was unable to oppose a body corporate pharmacy unless it could be shown that the pharmacist's existing business would be adversely affected by the new pharmacy's close proximity. Conversely, the dispensing doctors would have been able to appeal against Mrs Popat if her contracts had been granted first.

<H3><B>High failure rate enquiry</B></H3>
<P>

The Young Pharmacists' Group is urging the Royal Pharmaceutical Society to take action over the high failure rate in the registration exams. Nearly half the UK candidates who sat the exam in October failed. The YPG's public relations officer, Sultan Dajani, believes there must be a flaw in the system rather than in the students. 
<P>
The YPG is concerned that high failure rates will compound the manpower problem, particularly in the 'fallow year' when degree courses change to four years. 
<P>
Although YPG is in favour of a registration exam, Mr Dajani believes there is a case for abandoning it until 2002 when the fallow year is over. He also thinks more should be done to assure the quality of tutors. 
<P>
The Council's education committee has confirmed that its annual review of the exam 'might' encompass a discussion about the failure rate.

<H3><B>NHS Primary Care Bill published</B></H3>
<P>


Improved services for patients and more rewarding careers for doctors, dentists and other health professionals will result from proposed legislation in the NHS Primary Care Bill, which was published on Wednesday, claims the secretary of state for health, Stephen Dorrell. 
<P>
Under the new Bil,l purchases of certain services from pharmacists and optometrists by health authorities and health boards are to be treated as NHS contracts. If new pharmaceutical services are provided, extra resources will be forthcoming: they will not be paid for by a redistribution of the global sum, says Mr Dorrell.
<P>
The Bill also allows those GPs and dentists who want to develop and improve services to pilot their ideas, while those who are happy with the status quo will be free to continue on the present basis. Funding of 6 million is being made available.

<H3><B>Nurse prescribing still undecided</B></H3>
<P>
The issue of nurse prescribing was discussed at the Drug and Therapeutics Bulletin seminar in London last week The first trial of nurse prescribing has produced insufficient data to prove that it is cost-effective, says Mike Sowerby, prescribing project manager for the Department of Health.
<P>
He recommends increasing the sample size of the pilot project to involve the whole of the community trust. The wide variations in the cost of prescribing also need investigating.
<P>
Prescribing has, however, led to a better working relationship between GPs and nurses. 'Further pilot studies and PACT analysis of data are the way forward now,' says Mr Sowerby. A further evaluation of the project is due next month. Early findings suggest that nurses are gaining more job satisfaction and that patients welcome them prescribing.

<H3><B>Boots seek judicial review after 'rural' misconduct verdict</B></H3>
<P>
Boots the Chemists and its superintendent pharmacist, Marshall Davies, have been found guilty by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society's Statutory Committee of professional misconduct in providing prescription collection and delivery services in rural areas (C&D October 21 and 28, 1995, pp572 and 614).
<P>
But the Committee did not find the misconduct serious enough to strike Mr Davies off the register or to take any further action against the company.
<P>
The decision was reached by a majority of three to one. Chairman Gary Flather QC failed to agree with the three pharmacists on the Committee - Mohamed Aslam, Ann Marsden and William Rucker - and gave his dissenting view in the Committee's 33-page document published this week.
<P>
In 1994, Boots' branches in Salisbury and Scunthorpe had set up a scheme in which prescriptions were collected from doctors in Durrington, Wiltshire, and Winterton, Humberside, and the dispensed medicines returned to the surgeries. 
<P>
Late in 1993, new pharmacies had opened near the surgeries, offering full pharmaceutical services. Previously, the doctors had dispensed for the village residents.
<P>
Boots and Mr Davies came before the Statutory Committee accused of ignoring a Council statement, issued in June, 1993, which directed that such rural collection and delivery services should stop if a new pharmacy opened. The statement, although published, was not included in the Society's 'Medicines, Ethics and Practice Guide'.
<P>
The Committee agreed that Boots had not broken the law and that there was no direct criticism of the standards of the service, which would be acceptable in rural areas without a pharmacy.
<P>
The Winterton arrangement was discontinued at the request of local doctors who owned the company which bought the affected pharmacy in 1995. The Durrington service still continues "but there is much to be said in its defence", says the Committee's report.
<P>
In a statement giving the majority view, the Committee agreed that it should not be influenced solely by the commercial viability of individual pharmacies except where it was against the public interest: "Financial viability is not an ethical issue if fair and equal competition exists. The Committee is asked to decide on ethical issues."
<P>
The majority disputed Boots' claim that the Council statement was a restraint of trade, because it concerned the wholly professional activity of dispensing, whereas the Dickson judgment related to general selling activities.
<P>
Neither was the statement a restraint against the public interest, because if a new pharmacy opened, it would provide all the benefits of full pharmaceutical care. 
<P>
The effect on the public purse was also important. The Essential Small Pharmacy Scheme tried to make up the income of those pharmacies dispensing between 500 and 1,600 prescriptions a month to what they would receive if they dispensed 1,600. 
<P>
The Boots' service at Durrington reduced prescription numbers at the new pharmacy from almost 2,000 a month to just over 500. If the number fell below 500, the subsidy would be withdrawn and the pharmacy would close. 
<P>
The NHS was paying twice for most of the prescriptions processed by Boots - once to Boots and once to the Durrington pharmacy through the ESPS subsidy.
<P>
The Boots' service in Salisbury dispensed only repeats, within 48 hours, and not urgent supplies or scripts for acute illness. It could be accused of "cherry-picking" the easier options. 
<P>
The Committee majority found it "unattractive that a large company, with enormous resources stemming from nearly 1,200 pharmacies, should endanger the future of a small pharmacy struggling to maintain a comprehensive service to a small population in a rural area". 
<P>
The Committee chairman, in his dissenting decision, said Boots had not deprived the villagers of a full pharmaceutical service, as that was still available. "The prospective patients chose not to avail themselves of it ... it really is impossible to describe as serious misconduct the provision of a doctor-approved delivery and collection service which the patients chose to use, rather than the village pharmacy."
<P>
Mr Flather could not accept that Boots had conspired with the doctors to "do down" the Durrington pharmacy. Boots would have realised it was reducing the prescriptions dispensed at Edwards, "but to say that that in some way condemns them, is to condemn competitive business carried out everywhere". 
<P>
"The Statutory Committee's task is to concentrate on evaluating the ethical side of things strictly on the evidence laid before it." The Committee must not be unduly influenced by questions of policy, including the relationship between doctors and pharmacists over doctor dispensing. 
<P>
The only thing missing from Boots' service was the presence of a pharmacist to meet the patient and give advice. This face to face contact was certainly in the public interest, but other acceptable services had "this bit missing as well", such as delivery of medicines by a non-pharmacist to a housebound patient. As Boots' service was for repeat prescriptions, patients were likely to be "well settled". The Boots' manager had monitored medication and encouraged contact with patients with queries.

<H3><B>Pharmacy sales slide, but margins climb</B></H3>
<P>
Retail chemists in the UK have seen sales growth slow over the past year, but financial strength is improving.
<P>
Average sales were up 9 per cent, compared to 12 per cent a year earlier, but performance varied considerably throughout the sector and 42 per cent of companies achieved average or better growth.
<P>
Of the 1,560 companies analysed in the 'Plimsoll portfolio analysis: retail chemists', the smallest companies, those with a turnover of less than 2m, recorded a 1 per cent increase in sales, while those with turnover in excess of 23m reported sales up 13 per cent.
<P>
However, while sales figures fell, pre-tax profit for the past 12 months' margins increased to 3 per cent of sales compared to 2 per cent a year earlier. 
<P>
Small businesses averaged a 3 per cent pre-tax profit margin, while large companies reported 4 per cent. Despite this, 22 per cent of companies surveyed did not report a profit.
<P>
From analyses of company accounts over the past four financial years Plimsoll classifies businesses as 'strong', 'good', 'mediocre', 'caution' and 'danger'.
<P>
Although over a third of the businesses surveyed showed signs of financial difficulty, the situation has improved during the past 12 months.
<P>
Sales growth, trading stability, profitability, working capital, gearing and immediate liquidity are all covered by the report.
<P>
* A Plimsoll report on healthcare companies found a similar pattern: sales growth has slowed from 19 per cent 12 months ago to 14 per cent, but the industry reported a 6 per cent pre-tax profit margin, up from 5 per cent a year earlier.
<P>
Companies with turnover between 5m and 12m reported the biggest growth in sales of 17 per cent. Smaller companies, with a turnover of less than 5m, recorded increases of 15 per cent, while those with a turnover in excess of 50m had sales up 12 per cent.

<H3><B>Bayer denies accusations of restrictive practice</B></H3>
<P>
Bayer, the German pharmaceutical company, has been fined Ecu3 million (2.35m) by the European Commission for violating an EU law on restrictive practices.
<P>
The EC says that the case involved Bayer's refusal to sell Adalat, its heart drug, to wholesalers in France and Spain, who wished to re-export the drug to the UK, where prices are higher than in the rest of Europe. 
<P>
Bayer is appealing against the fine. The company says it is unable to give a detailed response at the moment because it has not received a full statement of the reasons for its fine.
<P>
However, the company says that it "has not categorically violated the legal provisions of the Treaties of Rome". It also protests at the EC's "unconventional legal stance in interpreting the antitrust rules".
<P>
According to the EC, Bayer set up a system to identify the wholesalers in France and Spain who were buying more Adalat than they required for the domestic market alone in order to export the rest.
<P>
Bayer, says the EC, penalised the wholesalers by reducing the volume of Adalat they supplied. Wholesalers claim that Bayer was no longer willing to supply them with the volumes they required as early as 1989.
<P>
Bayer believes that the Commission's aim is to restrict the company's freedom to decide what quantities of products to sell to which businesses. Although Bayer does not dominate the market, it would be forced to supply whatever quantities of products businesses request in countries with government-controlled low prices. Such businesses, the company says, would then export Bayer's products to countries, including the UK, where prices are higher.
<P>
Bayer says that supply requirements are forecast by  subsidiaries for their local markets based on past experience. In isolated cases, the company says, wholesalers who obviously order more than they require for the local market may receive lower quantities than they ordered.
<P>
The Commission concluded that such practices involved a serious infringement of the Community law on competition. Bayer says that the legal opinion expressed by the Commission during the proceedings is "incomprehensible".<P>

<H3><B>OTC antihistamine and H2 antagonists next for POM to P?</B></H3>
<P>
Azelastine hydrochloride to treat hayfever and nizatidine to relieve heartburn are the latest POM to P switches proposed by the Medicines Control Agency.
<P>
Azelastine would be indicated for treating seasonal allergic rhinitis in adults and children over 12 years, for non-aerosol nasal administration. The maximum dose would be 140mcg per nostril, with a maximum daily dose of 280mcg per nostril. The maximum pack size would be 36 doses.
<P>
Consultation letter MLX 222 also proposes making nizatidine a P medicine to prevent the symptoms of food-related heartburn in adults and children over 16. The maximum dose would be 75mg, with a maximum daily dose of 300mg. The maximum number of doses is four, over a maximum of 14 days. Pack size would be restricted to four tablets.
<P>
The letter also proposes that fenticonazole nitrate, bacillus salmonella typhi and tramadol hydrochloride be added to Schedule 1 (1) of the POM Order.
<P>
Comments on the proposals should be sent to Dugan Cummings, Room 1105 MT, Medicines Control Agency, Market Towers, 1 Nine Elms Lane, London SW8 5NQ, by February 28. The MCA plans to implement these proposals by June 28, 1996.<P>

<H3><B>Call to limit paracetamol pack size to 25</B></H3>
<P>
Oxford psychiatrists are calling for a maximum paracetamol pack size of 25 tablets in the latest <I> British Journal of Psychiatry</I>.
<P>
Research on 80 patients admitted to hospital through paracetamol overdose revealed that 37 per cent said that they would have taken a smaller overdose, or none at all, if the pack sizes had been smaller.Making the drug Prescription only would prevent 35 per cent from taking an overdose, although 20 per cent would still go ahead and a further 40 per cent said they would use an alternative drug or means of self-harm. But the authors point out that this would also limit paracetamol's analgesic use.
<P>
They conclude that the most pragmatic option is to restrict pack sizes to a maximum of 25 tablets for paracetamol, and other similar preparations, to limit the risk of overdose.
<P>
But the director of the Paracetamol Information Centre, Dr Geoffrey Brandon, has his doubts. "At the end of the day, you have a move that may not save any lives at all but will inconvenience millions of users," he says.
<P>
While not arguing with the report's findings, he believes smaller packs will not deter would-be suicides and adds that for patients using the drug as an analgesic it would require them to buy more packs at a greater cost. "That may drive people to the doctor to get a prescription instead," says Dr Brandon.<P>

<H3><B>New DoH prescribing advice centre for England</B></H3>
<P>
The Department of Health is setting up a new prescribing centre for England, which will absorb the Medicines Resource Centre (MeReC).
<P>
The National Prescribing Development Centre will run from April 1 from the Royal Liverpool Hospital. Its aim is to support the needs of the new health authorities by providing them with expert advice and services to encourage good quality, effective prescribing. As such, it will swallow the activities of MeReC, the Medical Advisers Support Centre and a number of other national units.
<P>
There will be little impact on MeReC's role as it will continue to produce its monthly bulletin. "It does not affect us greatly at the moment, but the future will involve us doing work around what the new health authorities want. The feedback that we get will determine how we change," says MeReC director Nick Hough, who will retain his position. The organisation's staff have signed two year contracts.
<P>
The new centre is expected to employ 15-20 people, with additional recruitment once it is up and running. However, there will be a move towards commissioning centres of excellence in establishing the best training, education and advice on prescribing issues.
<P>
The DoH is advertising for a director who will determine the needs of the new HAs and draw up a structure for the centre accordingly.<HR>

<H3><B>Council concerned about threat to distribution of pharmacies</B></H3>
<P>
The Royal Pharmaceutical Society's Council is to prepare a document on the distribution of community pharmacies. Council also agreed the topic should be discussed with the Department of Health's chief pharmacist, Bryan Hartley.
<P>
Hemant Patel presented a paper on community pharmacy dispensing workload and remuneration distribution to support his belief that distribution was "being remodelled using a new back-loading method of remuneration". 
<P>
Mr Patel wondered whether the Department was discriminating against large numbers of single-handed pharmacies and whether there would be an adverse effect on the distribution network. 
<P>
He thought present remuneration arrangements would accelerate the demise of the independent and was concerned about a recent speech in which Mr Hartley claimed the future would be set by public limited companies. He wondered what form Mr Hartley wished the profession to take in the future.
<P>
Christine Glover asked for a short document to be produced, highlighting the main points raised in the debate. A decision could then be taken on how each point could be addressed.
<P>
<B>Continuing education monitoring</B> Council agreed that, when completing their annual retention fee form, pharmacists should be asked to volunteer how much continuing education they had undertaken in the previous year. All, or a large sample, would then be analysed and the results be reported back to Council.
<P>
<B>Prereg training improvement</B> Council agreed that the Society should take steps to improve performance requirements for newly-registered pharmacists, beyond those in the current core competencies, to produce a "better all-round" pharmacist. The new goal would replace the long-standing policy of working towards a mandatory joint preregistration year involving six-month periods in both hospital and community pharmacy. A compulsory split year had been recommended in 1987. The new policy would aim to achieve the same objective by specifying broad outcomes of training rather than by requiring a certain structure to the year.
<P>
<B>Advertising regulations</B> The Law and Ethics Policy Committee noted that a proposed restriction on the advertising of products for musculo-skeletal pain had now been changed following representations.The Medicines Control Agency's original proposal had been for a ban on advertising to the public of medicines for the treatment of "serious musculoskeletal disorders, including arthritis". The proposal had been amended to cover products for "joint, rheumatic and collagen disease" (such as septic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, gout and polymyalgia rheumatica), with an exemption for products for "the symptomatic relief of sprains and strains, and pain due to non-serious arthritic and rheumatic conditions".
<P>
<B>Professional competence</B> Council approved a document on 'Good practice for ensuring professional competence', setting out a simple cyclical process by which pharmacists might seek to maintain or enhance their competence. It will be published in future editions of 'Medicines, ethics and practice: a guide for pharmacists'.

<H3><B>Conduct code for Council members</B></H3>
<P>
The Royal Pharmaceutical Society's Council has approved a draft code of conduct for Council members. A deliberate breach could result in Council passing a motion of censure naming the member concerned.
<P>
The six-point code states that members:
<UL>
<LI>must, while acting as Council members, at all times ensure that their activities are directed towards fulfilling the Society's objects specified in the Supplemental Charter and the Society's responsibilities specified in legislation.
<LI>ensure that the Society's funds are properly applied to furthering the Society's objects
<LI>must not make use of information, acquired by reason of their position, for personal gain
<LI>must not use their position to promote private interests
<LI>must respect the confidentiality of information identified as confidential and acquired solely by virtue of their position
<LI>must not use their position to seek to influence the conduct of any aspect of the Council's business for the benefit of any individual, body corporate or other association, rather than the profession as a whole.
</UL>
<P>
During debate at this month's meeting, Graham Walker said he could see occasions when some members would be in breach of the code almost by accident. Marshall Davies saw problems with clause 6, because all members held strong views and on which they would try to convince others. The secretary and registrar, John Ferguson, explained that if Mr Davies sought to argue something that was in the interest of Boots, he would have to be convinced it was in the interests of the profession as a whole.

<H3><B>BPSA calls for independent audit for P sales</B></H3>
<P>
The Royal Pharmaceutical Society should contract an independent body to assess the appropriate sale of pharmacy medicines, says the British Pharmaceutical Students' Association.
<P>
Voting unanimously at this year's BPSA Conference in Leicester, motion proposer Philip Wragg (ex-Nottingham) said the profession needed to take control of auditing through a programme of test sales and should not leave it to the likes of Which?. "We need it so we know where we are going right and where we're going wrong."
<P>
Bronagh Killen (ex-London School of Pharmacy) did not believe pharmacists would object to such tests. "It's the only way you'd know if the training message had got through [to pharmacy assistants]. Pharmacists would get feedback and re-focus their training."
<P>
Delegates heard that pharmacy was quick at making excuses for outside criticisms, but rarely came up with anything positive to rectify these problems. By taking control of its own audit and using its own protocols the profession could help improve standards, as well as demonstrate its commitment to patient care.Other motions carried at the conference included:
<UL>
<LI>the RPSGB should publish a summary of the results of accreditation visits to Schools of Pharmacy.
<LI>there should be a minimum wage for all qualified pharmacy counter assistants
<LI>the Department of Health should improve its system of disseminating drug alerts to health professionals so that they receive information before its release to the public
<LI>the RPSGB should only accredit new four-year courses that have an increased and standardised social and behavioural sciences content.

<H3><B>Pay problems could scupper Scottish electronic pricing project</B></H3>
<P>
The Scottish SCRIPTS project could run into problems if pharmacists are not paid for the equipment and extra manpower involved.The Scottish Pharmaceutical General Council is making it clear that pharmacists will go along with the scheme, in which prescription data is sent electronically to the Pharmacy Practice Division for pricing, only if their costs are met. The SPGC has discussed payment with representatives of the Scottish Home and Health Department and the PPD.
<P>
Says SPGC secretary Dr Colin Virden: "Any [electronic] system will involve extra work and expense for pharmacists. We think that the costs of updating equipment and the day to day running of the scheme should be borne by the people who want the data, which is ultimately the Government."
<P>
Jim Brunton, a single-handed proprietor in Edinburgh who has been involved in SCRIPTS trials, calculates that prescription pricing takes him 20-30 per cent longer than it used to. It has cost him a couple of hundred pounds to update his software and install a dedicated telephone line. "If the system becomes permanent, I will need to consider employing another half a member of staff," he says.
<P>
Alistair Meldrum, of Kennyhill Pharmacy, Glasgow, says: "The main benefit is that the PPD gets the information sooner, but will this mean pharmacists get paid more quickly?" 
<P>
The PPD says the project is going very well. "Although slightly delayed, as almost every IT project of this type is, SCRIPTS is well on track to be the future mainstream means of processing prescription data in Scotland," a spokesman says. There had been problems, but these were "only minor bedding in and teething problems". All had been resolved or were in the process of being resolved.
<P>
Some nine pharmacies have taken part in the pilot and testing phase, with about 90 per cent of pharmacies in Scotland expected to be SCRIPTS sites. The remainder are likely to be small rural, low-volume pharmacies. By mid-1997, most of those pharmacies which intend to be in the system should be incorporated.

<H3><B>Stricter rules coming for slimming pills? </B></H3>
<P>
The Medicines Control Agency and other medicines agencies in the European Union are considering stricter treatment guidelines for anorectic agents.The guidelines have not been published officially, but C&D understands that they seek to tighten up on private slimming clinics, where clients are poorly monitored and the drugs are prescribed for people who are not obese. The guidelines are expected to recommend that the drugs are used only under controlled supervision by medical experts.
<P>
3M Health Care is currently discussing with the MCA ways of bringing the prescribing guidelines for Duromine (phenteramine) into line with the latest recommendations.
<P>
The dangers of indiscriminate use of appetite suppressants was highlighted on the BBC Radio 4 programme, 'You and yours' on Tuesday. Telephone callers to the programme's helpline were recommended to consult a general practitioner before going to slimming clinics. The General Medical Council warned doctors two years ago they faced disciplinary action for irresponsible prescribing.

<H3><B>UK prescribing costs remain low</B></H3>
<P>
The NHS medicines bill remains the second lowest in Europe  - and one of the lowest in the world. The average cost of a prescription is 8.65, with almost 545 million prescriptions written in the UK in 1995, according to Dr Trevor Jones, director general of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry. 
<P>
The spend on medicines accounts for only 11 per cent of the total NHS bill. These figures pose the question of whether we are making the most of our medicines, said Dr Jones, who was speaking at the launch of the ABPI's annual report. "Cheap prescribing is by no means always good prescribing", he said.
<P>
Dr Jones advocated a move towards evidence-based prescribing of medicines, but said that the difficulty lay in persuading the Government, particularly the Treasury, that a rise in the medicines bill could lead to a reduction in the overall NHS bill by reducing the need for surgery, hospital care and social services. 
<P>
Dr Jones believed that using the best medicines was the right way forward, both to improve the nation's health and control the NHS drugs bill. However, this did not mean placing limits on GPs' prescribing by means of a national formulary or use of limited lists. 
<P>
The pharmaceutical industry was currently working on providing more information to patients, not only through the leaflets in patient packs but also through a new voluntary scheme, by which companies were making licensing data on new medicines, including information on safety and side-effects, available to the general public.
<P>
The drug industry was currently heading towards a record-breaking 2 billion trade surplus for 1995 on exports of more than 4bn. Spending on R&D also reached record levels of around 2bn in 1995.
<P>
The ABPI has been in talks with both the Government and the Labour Party to ensure that both sides recognise the importance of the pharmaceutical industry to the UK, both in terms of jobs and the wealth it brings to the country.

<H3><B>Surgichem rejects NPA's warning about Nomad marketing</B></H3>
<P>
Surgichem is consulting its lawyers over warnings issued by the National Pharmaceutical Association regarding the company's activities in residential and nursing homes (C&D March 9, p314).
<P>
The move comes in the wake of the NPA's February Board report, which warned pharmacists about Surgichem's marketing approach, which involved the company making direct approaches to nursing and residential homes offering the Nomad monitored dosage system. Homes are said to understand that Nomad will be provided free by local pharmacists. The NPA argues that the company is putting pharmacists in an impossible position: "Supply Nomad at no cost or lose the home".
<P>
Surgichem disputes the NPA's arguments. Managing director Norman Niven says an article in the current Pink Supplement is inaccurate and misleading. "PCS is not involved in any way with selling Nomad, PCS is about obtaining payment for pharmacists," he says. Mr Niven adds that the company is considering its legal position and will be taking appropriate action.

<H3><B>Pharmacies seek 6% increase in NHS 'global sum'</B></H3>
<P>
The Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee is pressing the Government for a 6 per cent increase in the core element of the global sum for 1996/97.
<P>
Such a rise on the current 645 million figure would not only cover the Department of Health's own prediction of a 3 per cent volume increase in prescriptions dispensed during this year, but would also recognise pharmacists' increased productivity and the problems with recruitment, retention and motivation.
<P>
In a letter to the Department, dated December 27, PSNC chairman David Sharpe says: "Remuneration for dispensing in real terms has progressively fallen far short of the increases in productivity that have been achieved." 
<P>
As revealed in C&amp;D last week, the number of scripts dispensed since 1987/88 has increased by 29 per cent, while remuneration, once adjusted for inflation, has fallen by 27 per cent .
<P>
Mr Sharpe also cites recruitment and retention problems facing the profession. The "steadily declining core gross profit, which has now sunk as low as 16 per cent", is "highly demotivating and unacceptable", writes Mr Sharpe.
<P>
PSNC is also asking for a value increase for existing non-core services, currently standing at 26.7m, in line with that for the core element. "There are volume demand increases applicable to the various elements. For example, there is likely to be an increase in volume for advice to nursing and residential homes of the order of at least 10 per cent."
<P>
In tandem with this, and in recognition of the difficulties experienced with the devolvement of budgets to local levels, PSNC suggests that local indicative budgets be replaced by the national budget element of the global sum, with fees set  nationally. "This would simplify local negotiations and save considerable time for both FHSAs and LPCs."
<P>
One further item on the agenda is late payment made to contractors, where PSNC has succeeded in securing the backing of a number of MPs. Late reimbursement for the cost of medicines dispensed, coupled with inadequate increases in the global sum over the past couple of years, is causing difficulties with working capital for contractors. 

<P>A resolution to what is seen by contractors as an important problem, would influence the PSNC's flexibility over the global sum increase, advises Mr Sharpe.
<P>
He offers a solution, which would resolve the matter by the April 1 deadline. "The cost involved would be a one-off ... it might even be financed either from any 1995/96 underspend by the Department or from a carry-over of 1995/96 monies into the 1996/97 financial year," suggests Mr Sharpe.

<H3><B>Pharmacy assistants must attain 80% pass mark in Society's MCQ test</B></H3>
<P>
An 80 per cent pass mark has been set for the first medicines counter assistants multiple choice questions examination to be held on January 25.
<P>
Supervising pharmacists are advised that any corrections to candidates' details have been amended on the Royal Pharmaceutical Society's database, but, as a large proportion of papers were prepared for mailing before Christmas, these amendments may not appear on the exam paper sent to pharmacists. If this is the case, the supervising pharmacist is asked to amend incorrect details on the paper before returning for marking.
<P>
Papers for assistants who have withdrawn should be returned. Examination papers submitted without the fee or signed declaration will not be marked.

<H3><B>Belfast gets European and MRC funding for community research projects</B></H3>
<P>
Two major community pharmacy research projects are to start soon at the Queen's University of Belfast, funded by the Medical Research Council and the European Commission.
<P>
The first project will examine the efficacy of the Pharmacists' Action on Smoking programme. It will last for 18 months and involve 100 pharmacies in Northern Ireland. The main investigators are Professor James McElnay, director of the School of Pharmacy, and Dr Terry Maguire, whose pilot work in his Belfast pharmacy led to the development of the PAS programme. The 72,000 project is being funded by the MRC and the Department of Health and Social Services.
<P>
The pharmacies will each recruit 12 smokers and will be reimbursed for their time. The aim is to see if a structured programme, like PAS, gives better results than the ad hoc advice given to smokers by community pharmacists. Any NI pharmacists interested in taking part should contact the project co-ordinator, Dr Orla McCallion, on 01232 335800. The project will be extended to England in the near future.
<P>
The second project, entitled "Improving the wellbeing of elderly patients via community pharmacy-based pharmaceutical care", is being funded through the European Commission BIOMED 2 Programme. Queen's will co-ordinate research taking place at seven European centres - Northern Ireland, Eire, the Netherlands, Denmark, Portugal, Sweden and Germany. Representatives meet in Belfast on January 25 to launch the project, which should be under way by Easter and will run for three years.
<P>
The research will investigate how pharmacists can educate elderly patients on disease states and the use of medicines, and monitor therapeutic outcomes. The latter could include domiciliary visiting if appropriate. At least 12 pharmacies in Northern Ireland will be involved.
<P>
The project came about through contacts Professor McElnay made through FIP's Pharmaceutical Care Network in Europe. He says: "I am very pleased we were able to attract these prestigious awards for our research in community pharmacy. To my knowledge, this is the first time community pharmacy-based research has attracted MRC and EU funding ... and helps confirm Queen's as a centre of excellence for this type of research."
<P>
These latest grants bring funding for the pharmacy practice research group's community-based projects to nearly 450,000 in 1995.

<H3><B>Fifty more pharmacies for Superdrug</B></H3>
<P>
Superdrug plans to open around 50 more in-store pharmacies in 1996, after achieving its target of 40 by the end of 1995.
<P>
The company, steered by business director Steven Round, will have opened 48 new in-store pharmacies in the year ended January, 1996. According to pharmacy controller Barry Simner, it hopes to open at least as many again in the following year.
<P>
Superdrug will continue buying up independent pharmacies and will also apply for new NHS contracts. Achieving the original target of 40 outlets by the end of this month has been "challenging", says Mr Simner.
<P>
This year, the company is geared up for buying and has a budget for pharmacy development in excess of last year's.
<P>
The move towards in-store pharmacies is part of an upmarket strategy for Superdrug - customer research has shown that such openings create a "halo" effect and change customers' attitudes to the brand.
<P>
Developing in-store pharmacies "fits totally" with the company's primary focus as a health and beauty retailer. Sales in stores where a pharmacy has been added "increase very positively indeed", says Mr Simner.
<P>
Superdrug has been seeking pharmacists, but "whoever says that recruiting pharmacists at the moment is easy would be lying", says Simner. The company is still looking for more new recruits.

<H3><B>Lloyds: good growth in second quarter</B></H3>
<P>
Lloyds Chemists reported sales up 2.1 per cent for the six months to the end of December, 1995, compared with the same period last year. All divisions performed better in the second quarter than in the first.
<P>
The chemists division rec-orded growth in both NHS and cash sales in the second quarter. Like for like sales increased by 5.9 per cent in the second quarter, well ahead of the 0.9 per cent first quarter improvement, re-sulting in first half sales of 255.6 million.
<P>
The Holland & Barrett health food division performed especially well during the second quarter. Like for like sales growth of 10.3 per cent to 43.6m in Q2 showed the impact of increased marketing and advertising expenditure, which, the company says, has generated greater brand awareness.
<P>
Like for like sales in the Supersave drugstore division declined in those stores yet to be converted. Lloyds began its restructuring last year and the stores already converted to the new format, with an emphasis on health, nutrition, fitness and beauty, registered higher customer numbers and increased sales compared with the second quarter of last year.
<P>
After a flat first quarter, the pharmaceutical division saw second quarter growth of 2.6 per cent, giving half year sales of 184.5m.
<P>
Despite repeated denials by Lloyds itself, rumours that the company may be taken over, possibly by a supermarket chain, still persist.

<H3><B>RPM battle 'far from over'</B></H3>
<P>

The Office of Fair Trading's decision to refer the Resale Price Maintenance issue back to the courts has strengthened resolve within pharmacy. The message being stressed by Community Pharmacy Action Group members is that the fight goes on.
<P>
 Royal Pharmaceutical Society president Ian Caldwell says: ''The battle is far from lost. Just to sit back and wait for the court case would be suicidal.''
<P>
The director general of the Office of Fair Trading, John Bridgeman, announced last Friday that he will seek leave to apply to the Restrictive Practices Court to examine whether RPM should continue. Mr Bridgeman hopes that a leave application will be heard by next spring, but it is not anticipated that the final decision will be made until early 1998, if, of course, the court decides to proceed with the review.
<P>
The announcement came as a disappointment to members of the CPAG, although the nature of the announcement had been anticipated because of the length of the inquiry since the OFT interim report earlier this year. The Proprietary Association of Great Britain, representing branded OTC medicines manufacturers, says that ''in spite of the OFT's decision, there is no imminent threat to RPM and therefore to pharmacy, due to the fact that it is the court, not OFT, which must evaluate and then decide on the future of RPM''.
<P>
Mr Caldwell anticipates that some sectors, such as Asda, will continue to fight for the removal of RPM in a media campaign, but says that the CPAG ''will continue to create a public opinion that there will be a penalty on the public if RPM is removed''. Both sides agree that unless the law is overturned, RPM will still be considered to be in the public interest and therefore legally enforceable. Mr Bridgeman's main tenet is that RPM should be banned ''because it prevents competition on price and leads to inefficiencies in trade''.
<P>
''Retailers who want to compete on price or offer special discounts to pensioners are unable to do so because they are forced by manufacturers and suppliers to sell at a fixed price,'' he said. ''Competent and efficient pharmacies will be able to adapt to the removal of RPM and may be able to increase their margins on some products by putting additional competitive pressure on manufacturers and suppliers.''
<P>
Defending his announcement, Mr Bridgeman accused the CPAG of causing ''undue alarm in the public's mind'' by suggesting up to 3,000 pharmacies may close. ''I believe that they have exaggerated the numbers of pharmacies at risk and this has caused unnecessary alarm. I do not believe there will be widespread closures of local pharmacies if RPM is removed,'' he said. The PAGB countered that OFT has not been able to contradict the Deloitte Touche study which came up with the figure of 3,000.
<P>
Mr Bridgeman believes that there are sufficient safeguards in place to support the pharmacies that would most likely be affected by the removal of RPM, such as the Essential Small Pharmacies Scheme. He also believes that an increasing proportion of pharmacy income comes from the NHS.
<P>
 ''On average, 60 per cent of their [pharmacists'] gross margins are guaranteed by NHS prescription business.'' Other reasons given by the DGFT to support his belief that there have been 'material changes' since 1970 include
<li>a higher proportion of chemists' turnover is now from prescriptions
<li>the OTC products on which the supermarket price competition would be possible, which  made up to 7-10 per cent of chemists' sales in 1970 now accounts for 3-4 per cent of sales
<li>consumers now visit chemists more often to have a prescription made up than to buy branded OTCs
<li>chemists in general are now more secure than they were pre-1970 because of entry controls introduced by the DoH in 1987 and because a higher proportion of their income is from the NHS
<li>the exemption order also covered RPM on ethicals, but enforcement of this by manufacturers was abandoned in the 1970s. The subsequent price competition between wholesalers did not lead to the adverse effects predicted by the court.
<P>
He was concerned that RPM did not apply to all medicines. ''It seems to be a bit of an anachronism that a branded medicine is subject to RPM, but not a non-branded medicine,'' he said.
<P>
Community Pharmacists Action Group chairman David Sharpe reacted to the DGFT's decision by saying: ''This is a bad recommendation by the OFT - and one which has no legal standing in its own right.
<P>
''We remain confident that we can still win in the Court, but ministers can and should call a halt to these proceedings now. They should give the issue a democratic airing as part of the debate on the forthcoming Competition Bill.
<P>
''I urge them to do so now and avoid the damage which the closure of thousands of pharmacies will inflict on the lives of communities up and down the country.''

Asda's chief executive, Allan Leighton, welcomed the DGFT's announcement, calling it ''a victory for ordinary working people and their families''. Commenting on the spring 1997 date for the first hearing, he said: ''Although it is a lengthy process, it signals the end for price-fixing.''
<P>
Asda has been campaigning for the removal of RPM for 12 months since it first cut the price of branded vitamins in its stores. The company also chose Friday to release its '10 Point Plan for Renewal of the Community Pharmacy', calling for:
<li>a pilot scheme for pharmacists prescribing on a limited list of pharmacy products
<li>set up a trial to give pharmacists guaranteed income from their patient list - in a similar way to GPs and their capitation payments
<li>give smaller pharmacies a fairer share of the available resources - tapering the fee income structure in favour of small pharmacies.
<li>develop the Essential Small Pharmacies Scheme
<li>lift the restrictions on opening pharmacies
<li>give direct assistance to small pharmacies - by reducing the uniform business rate for ESPs
<li>allow pharmacies to compete on price on branded products - to prevent their market share being eroded by the growing predominance of major own-brands.
<P>
Although Superdrug is supportive of the DGFT's decision, it will be waiting for the courts to make a final announcement. ''We have always said that we are for the removal of RPM on medicines, which we see as an unfair tax on the consumers. But the rules that exist are in place until the case is referred to the Restrictive Practices Court,'' said marketing director Stephen Round, who also has responsibility for the company's pharmacy programme.
<P>
Tesco's pharmacy superintendent, Mike Rudin, said that the company views the referral as an ''interesting move'', but will await the court's decision. He added: ''We will keep a watchful eye on the market. We would be concerned if anyone else made a move to cut prices.''

<H3><B>The legal position</B></H3>
<P>

The process of reviewing RPM is expected to last more than a year. Tthe CPAG and the OFT have set out the positionover the legal process. The OFT  view  is that it is up to pharmacists to prove that price-fixing should remain, but the CPAG has been arguing all along that it is up to the OFT to show that there has been 'material change' since 1970.
<P>
The case put forward by CPAG is:
<li>the OFT's views are of no legal relevance
<li>only the British courts can decide whether or not RPM still performs the role it was found to perform in 1970
<li>the legislative procedure for OFT's referral dictates two stages, both of which involve a court hearing. The first involves the OFT proving that there is enough evidence to hold a hearing by establishing a prima facie case of 'material change'
<li>if this application is successful, the case will go to court where the burden will be wholly on OFT to prove its case against RPM with the issue of the risk of pharmacy closures to be the key.
<P>
CPAG spokeswoman Sue Ashe says that the Group is committed financially to supporting the cause. She adds that CPAG has taken legal advice and has been told it has ''a very strong case''.
<P>
Mr Bridgeman said that he had approached the issue with the presumption that RPM is against the public interest. His colleague Dr Martin Howe said that the DGFT had to test whether the arguments still hold. The legal processes set out by the OFT are:
<OL>

<LI>In the case of an exemption, the burden of proof is on those seeking it to show that the ordinary assumption that RPM is against the public interest should be overridden.
<LI>Under the Resale Prices Act 1976, the DGFT, any supplier of the goods in question or any trade association whose members consist of or include suppliers, may apply to the Court to discharge an order previously made. No application may be made except with the Court's leave, and the Court may only grant leave upon appeal upon prima facie evidence of a material change in the relevant circumstances since its last decision.
<LI>The condition does not mean that the same Court looking at today's facts might come to a different conclusion; but that sufficient evidence can be presented to justify the other side being called on to adduce rebutting evidence; in summary, that there has been a change in an essential part of the reasoning by which the Court reached its previous decision.
<LI>The OFT hopes a leave application will be heard by next spring. The application would be supported by evidence on affidavit setting out the material changes the OFT has identified. The application may be opposed by the parties to the previous proceedings. They will be entitled to be heard by the Court, and other parties, eg supermarkets, may also wish to be heard. That would only be possible if the court permitted it.
<LI>If the Court grants leave, the DGFT will proceed to the substantive stage of the proceedings, which is to ask the court to discharge the 1970 Order. The OFT believes that the burden as to the public interest will lie on the parties seeking the exemption. It is unlikely that a substantive application would be heard before the beginning of 1998, possibly late next year.

<H3><B>Government is 'powerless' to intervene on RPM</B></H3>
<P>

The Department of Health made it clear it was powerless to intervene on the question of RPM, even though it remained ''committed to community pharmacy''.
<P>
''We have to remain aside from the competition issue,'' said a source close to health secretary Stephen Dorrell. Shadow health minister Keith Barron commented: ''It certainly isn't clear that abolition of RPM would be good for consumers or in the public interest, but it is clear that it could mean less choice of medicines and fewer places in which to buy them.''
<P>
A source close to shadow health secretary Chris Smith admitted there was little an incoming Labour Government could do if the OFT recommendation was upheld by the Restrictive Practices Court. 
<P>
Guy Howland of the Patients' Association said: ''We are very concerned by this decision. It will lead to major inconvenience to the public and in particular to patients who rely heavily on pharmacy services. We need Government action now to stop this.''

<H3><B>PSNC close to settlement</B></H3>
<P>

The Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee is close to finalising this year's remuneration settlement. Chairman Wally Dove said on Monday that the NHS Executive was still being intransigent and unreasonable over late payments. PSNC was continuing discussions and hoped to inform contractors of the outcome within the next few weeks. 
<P>
<STRONG>Discounts agreed</STRONG>: PSNC has agreed the target discount clawback rate at 7.82 per cent for 1996-97, based on the total NIC. This equates to a rate of 8.37 per cent on purchases qualifying for discount; that is, excluding zero discount NIC. The previous year's clawback rate was 7.74 per cent based on total NIC, but this was reduced to 7.63 per cent to reflect the introduction of zero discount on refrigerated lines from November 1, 1995. The current clawback scale is recovering 7.32 per cent of total NIC or 7.87 per cent of NIC, excluding zero discount, so an under-recovery is now taking place. PSNC is negotiating an extension - beyond March 31, 1997 - for this under-recovery to be paid back. Once this has been agreed, a new clawback scale will be calculated with a view to it being effective from December 1, 1996.
<P>
<STRONG>Patient packs</STRONG>: PSNC hopes soon to resolve the dead stock issue, but some Terms of Service details have still to be ironed out. The joint working group on patient packs hopes to get back on the original target of 1998 for proper implementation of the scheme. This would mean legislation covering Terms of Service being introduced in the first half of next year. More definite information about the implementation timetable is expected by the end of November.
<P>
<STRONG>Local budgets 1995-96</STRONG>: PSNC has received further evidence from LPCs that local budgets are not working. Once all the information on expenditure on devolved services has been collected, PSNC will raise the matter again with the NHS Executive and will write to the LPCs with overspends.
<P>
<STRONG>Devolvement of oxygen</STRONG>: PSNC does not support or endorse the managed domiciliary oxygen service proposed by the Oxygen Therapy Co. However, the company provides apparatus for use with liquid oxygen - the Lox system - which PSNC believes may have clinical advantages.

<H3><B>PCSA remains 'open minded' about PRS</B></H3>
<P>

The Pharmacy Computer Suppliers Association held a special meeting last week to discuss the concerns pharmacists have raised about Practice Resource Systems' Health Plus Manager.
<P>
Ian Shepherd, PCSA secretary, said this week that the association remained open-minded about the new system, but felt some of the issues raised needed some earnest discussion, particularly the security, ownership and confidentiality of data collected. 
<P>
The PCSA has invited PRS representatives to its next meeting in November to help members give their pharmacist customers better advice.
<P>
The PCSA, which represents over 90 per cent of pharmacy computer suppliers, includes Boots, Unichem and AAH among its members, as well as specialist computer companies such as John Richardson, Chemtec and Park Systems. The group has been helping the NHS develop the pharmacist's role in computer terms, setting standards and co-ordinating with other bodies in an effort to ''move forwards with flat playing fields'', said Mr Shepherd. 
<P>
PCSA was promoting secure, open and common standards so all pharmacists could develop their professional role in the primary care team. Members at last week's meeting emphasised the need for pharmacists to be able to communicate with general practitioners, other NHS networks and wholesalers, and not just within a closed community.

<H3><B>Gehe plays cautious game</B></H3>
<P>

Gehe refuses to be rushed as it plans its next move, following Unichem's bid for Lloyds Chemists last week. Dieter K&auml;mmerer, Gehe's chairman, told C&D: ''Why should I be in such a hurry? We continue to have an interest in Lloyds, but we still have some difficulties in evaluating the various impacts to our offer, which have evolved during the [deliberation] process.
<P>
Mr K&aumlmmerer says he remains worried by Lloyds' recent results and by how the acquisition of Lloyds could affect Gehe. ''There's obviously one party in this game who thinks these factors do not matter. I'm of a different opinion,'' he says. 
<P>
Within minutes of the Government's approval for both Gehe and Unichem to resume their bid battle, Unichem had placed a share and cash offer that valued Lloyds at 657.6 million. Unichem's offer, basically the same format as its pre-Monopolies and Mergers Commission bid, put forward 16 new Unichem shares and 926p in cash for every ten Lloyds' ordinary shares. As Unichem's share price had risen since its last bid, its latest offer was about 7m higher.
<P>
The company's ordinary offer values each Lloyds' share at 505.4p. Its preference offer is 59.742p in cash and 1.0323 new Unichem ordinary shares for each Lloyds' preference share. This values Lloyds' preference share capital at 30.1m.Mr Kauml;mmerer admits the offer surprised him. ''It takes a lot of courage for them to quote the same offer as they gave some months ago, and which they declared as their final offer. This offer is changing day by day because of the differences in Unichem's share price.'' 
<P>
Mr Kauml;mmerer believes Unichem would face ''significant risks'' over the acquisition because of the relative sizes of Unichem and Lloyds, and its ''lack of experience in integrating major acquisitions''. Jeff Harris, Unichem's chief executive, has no doubt that he can handle the integration of Lloyds. ''In the last four to five years, we've done a multitude of deals, including the development of Moss. We've had a year to plan this and we're strengthening our board.''
<P>
Unichem, he adds, has a good reason for launching a share and cash bid. ''I want to discriminate between the cash offer and the share offer because the feedback we've had from a number of Lloyds' institutions is that they want a continuous stake in the healthcare industry. I believe that they would want to become shareholders of Unichem,'' he says.
<P>
Unichem estimates that, within 12 months of the acquisition, it should realise cost-savings and revenue benefits of over 15m, rising to 20m annually. After the first 12 months, it adds, earnings should increase substantially. Unichem expects to pay 34m in rationalisation costs connected with the acquisition - 8m more than originally estimated.
<P>
Mr Harris says Lloyds remains a great opportunity for both sets of shareholders. ''We believe our extensive retail expertise will greatly enhance both our businesses,'' he says.

<H3><B>Unichem delists Unipath</B></H3>
<P>

Unichem is delisting Unipath products because the manufacturer has blocked its move to stock the Persona contraceptive. The wholesaler's ban includes Clear Blue, Unipath's brand-leading pregnancy testing kit, which has been swept from Unichem's shelves. Last week, Unichem placed an order for Persona, whose distribution has been restricted exclusively to Boots for one year.
<P>
Martyn Ward, Unichem's sales and marketing director, says it has acted in the interests of independent pharmacies. ''Persona is a logical product for independent pharmacists to stock, as its sales require a confidential environment, a trustworthy source of advice and a caring approach, which is exactly what the community pharmacy provides. We have no desire to impose sanctions on any section of the market, but we must protect the interests of our customers,'' he says.
<P>
Chris Etherington, Unichem's director of operation, says it wants to resolve the situation. ''We're trying to get them away from their position of entrenchment. We want them to come and talk to us as a representative of independent pharmacies, so that we can resolve this unsatisfactory situation,'' he says.
<P>
Mr Etherington says his company will reconsider stocking Unipath products if, and when, it gets the chance to sell Persona.

<H3><B>Profession approves drug task force suggestions</B></H3>
<P>
Pharmacy bodies have welcomed the Government's recognition of the potential role of pharmacy in tackling drug abuse.
<P>
In a series of recommendations by the drug task force, pharmacies are seen as having the potential to offer extended services to drug misusers, including controlled drug supervision, comprehensive needle exchange services and delivery of health promotion. The Department of Health is also urged to consider setting up pilot projects to investigate furthering this "untapped potential", rather than forcing changes upon pharmacists. 
<P>
Roger Odd, head of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society's practice division, which was consulted on the document, says the task force was surprised at the level of pharmacist involvement. This is echoed in the report by the comment "we were impressed by the current commitment of many pharmacists".
<P>
Another consultee, Jeremy Clitherow, chairman of Liverpool Local Pharmaceutical Committee, sees the recommendations as a green light for pharmacy. "It identifies the health gains available through community pharmacy," says Mr Clitherow.
<P>
He adds that the report's recommendation that there should be comprehensive syringe exchange facilities using community pharmacies makes pharmacy "the focal point, making contact with users and passing them on to a more specialised agency".
<P>
The Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee's secretary, Steve Axon, says: "Overall it is encouraging to see that pharmacists do provide such an excellent service to patients and hopefully that will be rewarded."
<P>
Colette McCreedy of the National Pharmaceutical Association says the NPA is "pleased to learn that the Department may put more resources into the scheme and hopes that pharmacists are included in the plans".
<P>
The task force based its recommendations on pharmacist evidence and the results of a DoH-funded survey of changing attitudes towards pharmacy services of drug misusers, which shows "encouraging signs of growing involvement", the report notes.
<P>
The survey found that 51 per cent of more than 7,000 English and Welsh pharmacies questioned dispensed for addicts, up from 23 per cent in 1988; 19 per cent were involved in needle exchange, with a further 36 per cent saying they would get involved if an exchange was set up in their area; and 35 per cent were selling injecting equipment, with another 41 per cent willing to do so.
<P>
On the negative side, 45 per cent thought drug misusers had an adverse effect on business; 72 per cent felt they needed training, and only 38 per cent felt they could approach others for help.

<H3><B>Home dispensing system on trial</B></H3>
<P>
A new system of drug delivery for patients at home is being developed at the University of Wales, Bangor. The telemedicine system enables patients to select the required dose of a drug, under the daily monitoring and control of a doctor. The patient activates a dispensing unit which delivers a metered dose in liquid form onto a fibre tablet. The medicine seeps out when the tablet is placed under the tongue.
<P>
The amount delivered is programmed by microchip, which prevents the drug being given if the daily dose has already been taken or the interval between doses is not long enough. The delivery unit is connected by modem to the doctor's computer.
<P>
In trials, Penn Pharmaceuticals supplied the drugs in sealed pouches. A pharmacist loaded the pouches and established the correct flow of drug.
<P>
Dr Kevin Doughty, of the University's medical physics unit, told C&D that patients could be supplied with drugs by post, but researchers decided to involve pharmacists to ensure the system was totally hygienic and to check the drug was being delivered correctly. The prototype allows access to the pharmacist only. The team is looking for funding to start clinical trials.
<P>
Dr Doughty believes the present method of standard dosing is haphazard, taking little account of a patient's age, body mass or sex, resulting in overdoses, side-effects or ineffective doses.

<H3><B>Call for referendum on standards tribunal</B></H3>
<P>
Dulwich pharmacist Ashwin Tanna wants to canvass pharmacist opinion on the Royal Pharmaceutical Society's setting up of a pharmacy standards tribunal.
<P>
Mr Tanna fears that the Society's Council has acted without the consent of the majority of the membership and he is therefore interested in initiating a referendum or special general meeting on the matter.
<P>
Mr Tanna argues that, although Council acted according to the bylaws in giving a 60-day consultation period, of the 17 pharmacists who responded, the majority objected, yet Council still rubber-stamped the tribunal's set up.
<P>
"It's the unanswerability of Council I disagree with," says Mr Tanna. "Nowhere in the bylaws, when they were published, did Council say 'if you disapprove, you could write to Council'."
<P>
The Society's secretary and registrar, John Ferguson, disputes Mr Tanna's arguments, saying that of the 17 responses, only two opposed the tribunal. "The majority," says Mr Ferguson, "were concerned about the position of the employee pharmacist, but we would not blame a pharmacist who was not responsible. Many of those agreed with the tribunal."
<P>
Mr Ferguson adds: "We are not talking about something that has been swept under the carpet here, it's something that has been in the domain for some years and I do not think Mr Tanna is right in saying the membership did not know it could write [voicing its disapproval]."
<P>
The Privy Council has yet to approve the standards tribunal, a decision that Mr Ferguson does not expect for a number of months.
<P>
Mr Tanna had written to the Privy Council to ascertain that Council was right to take this course of action. The Privy Council replied that it was an internal matter.

<H3><B>New JIC assistant rates from April - but pharmacist rates go</B></H3>
<P>
The National Joint Industrial Council for Retail Pharmacy has decided that its salary scales for pharmacy managers and pharmacists are unrepresentative of those actually paid and should therefore be withdrawn.
<P>
The Council has recommended a 2.7 per cent rise on its 1995 agreement for shop assistants and dispensing assistants. A 3.20 a week increase raises the minimum for shop assistants in the provinces from 118.62 a week to 121.82. 
<P>
The special relief rate, where difficulties are being faced by a pharmacy employer providing an essential service, has been lifted to a combined NHS and counter turnover of 4,985.
<P>
The rates are a contractual minimum for staff employed prior to April 1995, and the agreement is being continued as a useful guide for employers and trades unions.

<H3><B>AAH holds out on Scottish SCRIPTS</B></H3>
<P>
The debate over the benefits of Scotland's electronic prescription data collection system, SCRIPTS, continues, with AAH Pharmaceuticals questioning whether it should develop compatible Link software.
<P>
Link's marketing manager, Simon Driver, says: "The company believes that adapting our Link SCRIPTS software to incorporate the Prescription Pricing Division's SCRIPTS project would not benefit our users in Scotland."
<P>
AAH says it first started negotiations with the PPD more than two years ago. "The point made to the PPD was why should AAH Pharmaceuticals divert its programming resources away from those software requirements that our customers are asking us to develop to provide unfunded facilities for the PPD which do not benefit our customers and are commercially unacceptable to us as an organisation?" argues Mr Driver.
<P>
He adds that it is only "fair and reasonable" that the PPD provides full or partial funding for the project in exchange for a "major software change".

<H3><B>Seven Seas to be Merck's UK base for growth</B></H3>
<P>
Hanson has sold Seven Seas to the Merk Group of Darmstadt, Germany, for 150 million. Seven Seas' managing director, Clive Dixon, comments: "We shall continue to be based in Hull, where most our products are manufactured." 
<P>
Merck has not previously had a base for OTC sales in the UK and sees the purchase as an opportunity for expansion. The company's comment from Germany last week was that the move "closes the last significant gap in Europe". With the acquisition, it will have European self-medication sales of some DM360m.
<P>
Merck already markets a range of vitamins, skin care products and over the counter medicines, including a cough and cold preparation, and a chewable antacid product launched in 1995. In recent months, it bought Monot, a French herbal products company.
<P>
Seven Seas employs more than 400 people and has around 30 per cent of the UK market for vitamins and mineral supplements. It was acquired by Hanson in 1986 as part of the Imperial Group. In the year to September 30, 1995, it had sales of 59.3m. The sale takes the total amount realised by Hanson through the group's disposals to 2.5 billion.

<H3><B>Medicines are Britain's second biggest export earner</B></H3>
<P>
The British pharmaceutical trade was second only to the oil industry as a net contributor to the UK economy in 1995, according to final figures from the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry.
<P>
Exports of pharmaceuticals were worth 4,935 million, compared with 4,004m in 1994, while imports stood at 2,802m (2,304m in 1994).
<P>
Dr Trevor Jones, director general of the ABPI, says the figures showed the enormous contribution the industry made "towards the wealth  - as well as the health - of the nation when given the scope to develop the long-term strategies essential in a research-based industry. The benefit to Britain's economy in jobs, foreign earnings and tax revenues is also worth 2 billion a year."
<P>
Dr Jones, however, warns that imports are growing almost as fast as exports. It is vital that any Government, of whatever persuasion, continues to provide a stable environment, he says.
<P>
There was a 57 per cent jump in the trade surplus with the US and exports to the EU rose 38 per cent to 2,592m. Exports to Australia rose by 68 per cent.

<H3><B><A NAME="a"></A>Buyers bid for pharmacies</B></H3>

Over a quarter of panelists in Chemist &amp; Druggist's latest
Business Trends Survey were approached to sell their pharmacies
during the period July to September. In the South West region,
over half the respondents received such an offer. Small turnover
businesses had the highest incidence of offers.
<P>
The main reason given for rejection was that the price was too
low, but many respondents were still considering proposals - as
many as 71% in the North East.
<P>
The survey also reports falling margins for many pharmacies, despite
steady counter sales being predicted to continue into the next

in NHS volume will be maintained to the end of the year.

<H3><B>Judicial review for temazepam?</B></H3>
R P Scherer, which stands to lose &#163;millions because of the
Government's ban on NHS prescribing of temazepam capsules, has
won the right to a full High Court review of its case. The ban
was a reaction to abuse by intravenous drug users.
<P>
Scherer have argued that Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell failed
to give &quot;objective or verifiable&quot; reasons for his decision,
which they describe as &quot;unfair&quot; without adequate consultation.
<P>
Justice Dyson acknowledged that the complaints were &quot;arguable&quot;
and has ordered an expedited hearing, though a full hearing is
unlikely before March 1996.
<P>
The Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee is expecting
to receive clarification from the Department of Health on whether
the ban will proceed on January 1.

<H3><B>RPSGB plans standards tribunal</B></H3>

<P>
The Royal Pharmaceutical Society's Council has moved a step closer
to establishing a tribunal to investigate allegations of failure
to meet specified professional standards.
<P>
An addition to the Society's Byelaws allowing the tribunal to
be set up will be put to the membership for comment before being
submitted to the Privy Council for approval. 
<P>
The tribunal would make recommendations to Council about the member
concerned, including reimbursement of up to &#163;1,000 costs
(the Society's or the member's), but would not investigate allegations
of legal infringements. Failure to comply with a directive from
Council could result in a complaint about the member to the Statutory
Committee.

<H3><B>Ralgex and Diocalm go to Seton</B></H3>

<P>
Smithkline Beecham has sold the Ralgex topical analgesic range
and Diocalm antidiarrhoeal range (including Replenish) to Seton
Healthcare for &#163;7.78 million.
<P>
The rationale for SKB is that the company is committed to brands
with global potential, whereas sales of these products are largely
confined to the UK. For Seton, the portfolio extension complements
their existing Transvasin and J Collis Browne's brands.

<H3><B>Betaferon licensed for MS</B></H3>

<P>
Betaferon (interferon beta 1b) is a new agent from Schering Health
Care licensed for the treatment of patients with relapsing-remitting
multiple sclerosis. 
<P>
Distribution will be through the community pharmacy chosen by
the patient, who effectively &quot;registers&quot; with that pharmacy.
To facilitate post-marketing surveillance and batch-tracking,
pharmacists will be provided with an encoded patient treatment
number each time the product is ordered. Betaferon qualifies for
the expensive prescription allowance and will be classified ZD
in the Drug Tariff.

<H3><B>Pharmacy Update</B></H3>

<P>
In this week's Pharmacy Update, the pull-out-and-keep educational
section of Chemist &amp; Druggist:
<UL>
<LI>Inhaler devices: David Pruce reports on how professional audit
can prove the value of pharmacist advice and technique demonstration
in improving their effectiveness.
<LI>Coffee, tea and caffeine: Liz Jones investigates the pros
and the cons and concludes that everything's fine in moderation.
<LI>Smart drugs: Mark Colbridge looks at the claims and the theories,
but is unconvinced  the there is reliable research proving that
they actually work.
<LI>Research Digest: Omeprazole is the &quot;treatment of choice&quot;
for reflux; stopping smoking does make you fat; ginseng has benefits
in the management of non-insulin dependent diabetes; a holistic
approach to managing depression may be more cost-effective than
drugs; nicotine replacement therapy is worthwhile, especially
in more addicted smokers; variations in prescribing of psychotropics
suggest that GP attitudes and knowledge need targeting in any
campaign to reduce benzodiazepine use; monitoring to detect adverse
reactions to many slow-acting antirheumatic drugs could be reduced
after the first six months of treatment.

<H3><B>Society to examine control of exit</B></H3>
<P>
The Royal Pharmaceutical Society is to form a strategy group to discuss possible methods of controlled exit from the NHS contract. The move is in response to Council member Hemant Patel's proposal for compensation for pharmacists relinquishing their contracts <A HREF="http://www.dotpharmacy.com/feb3.html#c">Pick of February 3 issue</A>.
<P>
When the proposal came before Council last week, secretary and registrar John Ferguson said primary legislation would be needed. Some Council members thought the proposal was best examined under the "New Age" strategy. The new group will have a broader remit than a possible compensation scheme.

<H3><B>DoH issues guidance on local NHS budgets</B></H3>
<P>
Guidance on how to negotiate local budgets is to be produced by the Department of Health for the new health authorities.
<P>
The Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee's secretary, Steve Axon, says it clarifies problems over pharmaceutical care budgets.
<P>
One of the main features is that, where authorities are involved in accrediting pharmacies, they must adhere to the criteria and standards laid down in the Drug Tariff. "They must not bolt on their own additional requirements," says Mr Axon.
<P>
The guidance will also cover  indicative budgets, monies for services which must come outside of the global sum and cross-border issues. Mr Axon says the Government remains firm and there is no provision to pay pharmacies for services to patients in other health authorities.
<P>
The PSNC believes secretaries of local pharmaceutical committees who have attended courses on the subject of negotiating local budgets become more effective negotiators.

<H3><B>Pharmacy numbers fell in January</B></H3>
<P>
The number of pharmacies on the Royal Pharmaceutical Society's register of premises fell in January for the first time in over six months.
<P>
There are now 12,207 outlets, down 37. England was the main area of activity: 19 premises started trading and 44 were deleted from the register. The biggest acquisition was by AAH, which bought the 34-strong Medimart chain. Superdrug acquired six stores and began trading from three others; Tesco started up six premises, and Lloyds and Boots from one each.
<P>
Elders Pharmacies, the joint venture between Surgichem and Ashbourne, has bought a second pharmacy in Manchester. Elders purchased its first pharmacy, in Stirling, at the beginning of the year and the Manchester outlet may follow in its footsteps by providing pharmaceutical services to Ashbourne homes.
<P>

<A NAME="d"></A>
<H3><B>North East pharmacies' advice blasted</B></H3>
<P>
Pharmacies in the north east of England have been accused of offering "poor advice" in a newspaper article repeat of the latest Which? Survey (see <A HREF="http://www.dotpharmacy.com/jan6.html#b">Pick of January 6 issue</A>).
<P>
According to the Newcastle Upon Tyne Evening Chronicle, nine out of the ten pharmacies visited gave poor advice and "even potentially deadly drugs", when asked for either Nurofen for an asthmatic, Canestan or an antidiarrhoeal for a traveller with a persistent complaint lasting two to three weeks.
<P>
Some four pharmacies sold Nurofen, but only one asked any questions; three sold Canestan, two did not ask any questions, one asked if the customer had used it before and advised the patient to visit the GP if it did not clear up; three sold an antidiarrhoeal, with no questions asked in one case.
<P>
Newcastle Upon Tyne Local Pharmaceutical Committee secretary Peter Lowe takes a positive view: "I was hoping the article would have the effect of teaching people to expect questions and to seek out the pharmacist who would ask questions."

<H3><B>US pharmacists to get $600m after price fixing claims</B></H3>
<P>
A group of pharmaceutical companies is to pay $600 million (1=$1.5) to small retail pharmacists in the US to settle claims of price fixing.
<P>
Among the companies involved in the proposed settlement are Smithkline Beecham, Glaxo Wellcome, Pfizer and Zeneca. They deny the claims of price fixing, but believe that the out of court settlement is the best way to end litigation with the majority of the plaintiffs.
<P>
Each company will contribute to the settlement, which is still subject to court approval. SB will pay the plaintiffs $30m and will also provide them with supplies of a generic form of prescription cimetidine, worth $20m. Zeneca will be contributing four annual payments of $3.85m. Glaxo Wellcome's payment will be for $53.5m in total: because the litigation began before Glaxo's merger with Wellcome, $41.6m is Glaxo's contribution with the rest of the amount relating to Burroughs Wellcome.
<P>
The plaintiffs include at least 30,000 retail pharmacies. They brought the action against the pharmaceutical companies under the Sherman Antitrust Act.
<P>
In the US, retail pharmacists generally pay more for drugs than large organisations, such as hospitals and managed care groups, which often control the prescribing practices of large numbers of doctors and can negotiate big discounts for drugs by excluding the product from their formularies if these are not forthcoming.
<P>
The retail pharmacists' action claims that manufacturers colluded to keep drug prices high for them, thus helping to make up for the discounts offered to large organisations.
<P>
The firms that have agreed the proposed payment are only some of the 37 drug companies and 12 wholesalers named in the action.

<H3><B>Flu vaccine supply decision imminent</B></H3>
<P>
The Department of Health is expected to make a decision soon on whether flu vaccines should be supplied by GPs or by pharmacists dispensing FP10s.
<P>
The change could come into effect for the winter of 1997-98. An article in GP last week said doctors have strongly opposed the move because of the potential increased workload and reduced income. Patients would be inconvenienced and the vaccine's efficacy might be reduced if its temperature rose between  pharmacy and surgery.

<H3><B>Glaxo Wellcome unloads migraine drug</B></H3>
<P>
Glaxo Wellcome is to sell its anti-migraine compound, 311C90, to Zeneca for an undisclosed sum. Glaxo Wellcome must sell 311C90 to comply with terms set out by the US Federal Trade Commission, following Glaxo's acquisition of Wellcome last May. 
<P>
The compound is a 5-HT1 agonist in Phase III trials and Glaxo Wellcome will continue its clinical development until the sale is complete. It is expected to have certain therapeutic advantages over sumatriptan (Imigran), Glaxo Wellcome's acute migraine treatment that was launched in 1991 and analysts have predicted annual sales levels of $100-$250 million.
<P>
The acquisition is a move into a new therapeutic area for Zeneca, which currently has no analgesic products in its research and development pipeline.

<H3><B>NPA to reject Asda membership plan</B></H3>
<P>
The National Pharmaceutical Association is to reject any attempt by supermarket chain Asda to apply for membership. Following indications last week that Asda intends applying to join the Association, the NPA Board has ruled that it would turn down any such request because of the company's stance on Resale Price Maintenance.
<P>
NPA chairman Peter Jenkins says the Board will accept an application ''if the company is prepared to give an undertaking that it will not only change its marketing techniques for medicines but also stop its campaign and leave it in the hands of official bodies''. 
<P>
This week, Asda pulled Seven Seas Pure Cod Liver Oil with Multivitamins capsules from its shelves in its latest RPM salvo. Asda's deputy chief executive, Allan Leighton, justifies the company's action: ''At an RPM of 3.09, we think this product is poor value for money - particularly when Asda can offer the equivalent at only 1.49.''
<P>
The Community Pharmacy Action Group condemns the move. ''It can only be another attempt by Asda to focus public attention on their campaign, which will have a devastating effect on local pharmacies.''
<P>
Asda's attack is also focusing attention on its own-label sales, which it claims are ''doing tremendously well''. It adds that since it launched the range a month ago, customers have made total savings of 1 million. The CPAG is countering with the launch of a new phase of RPM defence activity at the start of August. In the interim, contractors are being sent a 'Support your local pharmacy - support RPM' poster through the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee News.
<P>
Backing for RPM has also come from the British Medical Association and the Royal College of Nurses, which have joined forces with the Royal Pharmaceutical Society to stress that ''medicines should not be promoted on price or subject to techniques, such as 'buy one get one free' ... which is designed to persuade someone to buy more of a medicine than is needed at the time''.
<P>
Meanwhile, the Office of Fair Trading is to publish an interim document at the end of this week that reflects the RPM data gathered so far. It is unlikely that it will give any indication of its final decision, which is expected in September. However, John Bridgeman, the director general of the OFT, said this week, in relation to a dispute over crisp price fixing by Golden Wonder, ''Resale Price Maintenance operates against the interests of consumers and I will take action wherever I come across it.''

<A NAME="b"></A>
<H3><B>1.1 million underpayment for contractors in 1995/96</B></H3>
<P>
Pharmacy contractors in England and Wales were underpaid by 1.1 million for 1995/96, reveals the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee's annual report. The shortfall arose because payments for period of treatment fees and expensive prescription allowances were less than forecast. The underpayment will be paid during 1996/97.
<P>
The total cost of core services for 1995/96 was 646.8m, with a further 26.6m for non-core services, such as residential and nursing home fees, rota payment and oxygen fees. It also includes payment for Patient Medication Records. However, the set-up fee of 300 for a PMR is to cease for most contractors from July 31. Thereafter, it will only be available to small contractors dispensing less than 1,100 items a month who are not in the Essential Small Pharmacy Scheme. PSNC reminds contractors who have not yet claimed their start-up fee that they should do so before the end of this month.
<P>
In 1995/96, 9.75m of the global sum was devolved. PSNC states that it favours local negotiation and selection from a national menu with a national budget for non-core roles, rather than the present arrangement. Some 284 pharmacies were paid 3.5m under the ESPS scheme. 
<P>
The National Prescription Research Centre checked 5,119,531 prescriptions on a routine basis, around 1 per cent of the total. The total value of those checked was 42,409,588.89 and the overall cash error was 0.13 per cent underpaid. A further 1,030,868 prescriptions underwent special checks at the request of contractors. The total value of these prescriptions was 8,618,017.44 with an average underpayment of 0.18 per cent.

<A NAME="c"></A>
<H3><B>Unichem and Gehe set for battle over Lloyds' depots</B></H3>
<P>
Unichem and Gehe are squaring up to resume their fight for Lloyds Chemists. But first, both must find buyers for Lloyds' full-line wholesale businesses in selected regions, a condition that they must meet if they want to re-bid. 
<P>
Last week, the Monopolies and Mergers Commission ruled that the bids by both companies for Lloyds were against the public interest because they would greatly reduce ''competition in full-line pharmaceutical wholesaling in certain areas of the country, resulting in higher prices and lower standards of service''.
<P>
Unichem is one of the two largest pharmaceutical wholesalers in the UK and, if its original bid had succeeded, would have commanded about 40 per cent of the UK pharmaceutical wholesaling market.  Last year, Gehe acquired AAH, the other major UK pharmaceutical wholesaler. Gehe is also Germany's second largest pharmaceutical wholesaler. 
<P>
Either AAH or Unichem stands to become the UK's largest pharmacy chain through a merger with Lloyds' 924 pharmacy outlets. Ian Lang, secretary of state for trade and industry, says Unichem will be allowed to re-bid for Lloyds only if it promises to sell the latter's wholesale depots at Cambridge, Carlisle, Coulsdon, Derby, Glasgow and York. It must also convince Mr Lang that it has a firm buyer, or list of buyers, for these depots. 
<P>
Gehe has to meet the same conditions over depots, with the addition of a further one in Belfast. The buyers must not be connected to either bidder, and they should be capable of running the depots effectively. Both companies have until October 18 to submit their lists of buyers to Mr Lang. The one that eventually succeeds in bidding for Lloyds must sell the depots within three months of its merger.
<P>
Jeff Harris, Unichem's chief executive, feels confident. ''The timing [of Mr Lang's announcement] is a bit surprising, but three months is a reasonable period to divest the depots,'' he says.
<P>
However, he believes Mr Lang has created an awkward situation because both companies need to sell, with one exception, the same depots. And it means both will often approach, or be approached by, the same potential buyers. ''We're both trying to sell businesses we don't  own. It's really a chicken and egg situation. I don't think I've ever come across a situation as bizarre as this, but it's one I think we'll be able to manage,'' comments Mr Harris.

<H3><B>'Loophole' closure may restrict GP dispensing</B></H3>
<P>
New dispensing doctors may lose the right to dispense if the so-called Clothier 'loophole' is closed. Proposals from the General Medical Services Council would see the loophole closed ''in return for new dispensing doctors losing the right to provide drugs to some patients at the periphery of their practice areas'', according to a report published in last week's General Practitioner.
<P>
The GMSC has not made public the amendments it has put to the Department of Health and will not comment on GP's claim. However, GMSC spokesman Huw Jones says: ''We realised that with the number of pharmacies opening up in rural areas under the loophole, it was really time to set the regulations right.'' 
<P>
The GMSC is expecting to meet with the DoH later next month. Mr Jones says the Department appreciates the GMSC's approach. However, Dr David Roberts, chairman of the Dispensing Doctors' Association, is understood to be against the proposal as it interferes with the rights of doctors to dispense.  
<P>
Dr Roberts, whose practice is in one of five Leicestershire villages where Shital Nilesh Popat, a pharmacist already on the pharmaceutical list, has applied to open six new pharmacies, has questioned what effect the applications will have on the Essential Small Pharmacies Scheme. 
<P>
Leicestershire Local Pharmaceutical Committee's secretary, Eddy Newell, comments that although the pharmacist's approach is somewhat unusual, in that six applications have been made by one person, he believes that they were made in good faith and should be considered individually.
<P>
Mrs Popat's action has also prompted dispensing doctors to lobby parliament to draw attention to the Clothier 'loophole'. MPs from all parties met with a group of GPs from the affected area. Petitions against the move were handed over which had been collected by the residents of Husbands Bosworth, the village where Dr Roberts has his practice.

<H3><B>Anti-malerials dispensing reminder</B></H3>
<P>
Pharmacists are reminded that they can submit, and will be paid for, anti-malarial prescriptions. Although the GPs' Terms of Service prevent them from prescribing anti-malarials prophylactically, the drugs can be prescribed for treatment of malaria. However, some doctors are not complying with this, as the drugs are not included on Part XVIIIA of the Drug Tariff.
<P>
Prescriptions Pricing Authority medical director Dr John Ferguson says that ''the drugs are not blacklisted, so the PPA has no option but to pay for prescriptions'', but GPs may be asked to justify the prescription and, if required, pay for it.

<H3><B>Postal strike delays results of pre-registration exam</B></H3>
<P>
Would-be pharmacists had a nerve-racking time waiting for their pre-registration exam results this year, thanks to last Thursday's postal strike. Fortunately, the Society had arranged contingency plans on discovering that the strike coincided with the day the results were to be posted.
<P>
The Society's main concern was over candidates who hoped to work as registered pharmacists from Monday, July 22. Those who failed the exam were notified by courier letter on Friday, successful candidates' notification was despatched via the ordinary post. The Society also set up a helpline, which operated on the Friday afternoon and Saturday morning, to tell candidates whether they were able to go ahead and practise. 
<P>
Those who had not completed the pre-registration period by Friday were asked to hold off calling until this week, although ''hundreds'' ignored this request, causing the lines to jam. The number of candidates who passed the exam will be revealed at next month's Council meeting.

<H3><B>Pharmacists to trial retail training software package</B></H3>
<P>
Ten independent pharmacists in the West Midlands have been selected to trial a software retail training package. Called Profitmaker, it has been devised by Retail Workshop Software, a Warwickshire-based consultancy that specialises in independent retail businesses.
<P>
Profitmaker comprises a software disk that can be supplied and updated onto CD-ROM, the Internet and other computer media systems. The disk contains ten training sections including layout, security and retail law. Most of the training modules are based closely on courses that Retail Workshop Software runs for independent retailers.
<P>
The programme, according to the company, seeks to ensure the retailer's business exceeds the minimum standards required by  retail NVQ levels I, II and III. It is expected to retail at about 120-150. The pilot is due to begin in October/November and is expected to end by January. A nationwide launch for all independent pharmacists is then expected in March/April, 1997. Other independent retail sectors will be covered by about August, 1997.

<H3><B>New advice on cot death</B></H3>
<P>
New guidelines have been published on reducing the risk of cot death. A leaflet drawn up jointly by the Foundation for the Study of Infant Death and the Department of Health emphasises the following measures:
<P>
<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>putting babies to sleep on their backs is safer than on their sides
<LI>the 'feet to foot' position may be the best way to avoid the baby's head being covered
<LI>bedsharing is risky if the parent is a smoker 
<LI>avoid letting anyone smoke in the same room as the baby.
</UL>
<P>
The guidelines were launched to coincide with the latest report from the National Advisory Body's confidential enquiry into stillbirths and death in infants. Results were incorporated into the new leaflet. Bulk orders of leaflets are available from the DoH, PO Box 410, Wetherby L23 7LN.

<H3><B>Pharmacists to be involved in ADR reporting from April</B></H3>
<P>

Both hospital and community pharmacists could be reporting adverse drug reactions through the existing 'yellow card' scheme by April if proposals from the Medicines Control Agency are adopted. 
<P>
In a consultation letter put out this week (MLX29), the Medicines Control Agency is proposing to extend the scheme to involve hospital pharmacists nationally. Community pharmacy reporting of ADRs would initially be restricted to demonstration schemes in the four regional monitoring centres (RMCs). Both hospital and community pharmacists would be obliged to operate within protocols.
<P>
Community pharmacists working within one of the four RMCs - Mersey, Northern, West Midlands and Wales - will be able to complete and sign yellow cards.  There will be two demonstration schemes running:
<P>
<li>Mersey and West Midlands. Pharmacists must be working in a community pharmacy which keeps patient medication records. He, or she, must have consulted directly with the patient concerned and discussed the case with the patient's GP before sending in a yellow card. No report should be made against the advice of the patient's GP.
<P>
<li>Northern and Wales. Pharmacists must work within a community pharmacy or be a practice-based pharmacy. They must have consulted directly with the patient, but need not have discussed the case with the patient's GP. The GP will be sent a copy of the report by the reporting community pharmacist.

<P>
The MCA will audit the number of ADR reports received from pharmacists and GPs by each RMC at six-monthly intervals. At the end of the first and second years of the scheme, the RMCs will question both groups about their reactions to the scheme.
<P>
For hospital pharmacists those with 'direct involvement in patient care will be recognised reporters'. Special reporting forms with space for the name of the responsible consultant will be used, but otherwise the system will be the same as that used by doctors.
<P>
After discussion of a case with medical staff, pharmacists will be able to complete and sign a yellow card. No report should be made against the advice of senior medical staff directly responsible for the patient.
<P>
The CSM/MCA will provide both hospital and community pharmacists with an information pack on the identification and reporting of ADRs. The Royal Pharmaceutical Society and the Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland are to encourage eligible pharmacists to undertake relevant education packages, such as those available from the CPPE and SCPPE.
<P>
The MCA's intentions were made clear by the head of the  Society's practice division, Roger Odd, at a Chemex seminar supported by C&D and Roche Consumer Health (C&D September 7, p312).

<H3><B>Rural disputes at High Court</B></H3>
<P>

Two contentious legal disputes between rural pharmacists and dispensing doctors are to be settled together before the High Court in London later this month.
<P>
Last Thursday, Justice Ognall, determined that a test case brought by Dr J Worthington and partners from Madeley, Staffordshire, was of such importance that it should be decided by two judges, and should certainly be heard alongside an almost identical case from North Humberside.
<P>
Both cases hinge around pharmacists who have made use of the so-called Clothier loophole to apply to open pharmacies. The doctors are challenging the strict interpretation of the regulations, which says that prejudice to medical services does not have to be taken into account when a pharmacy contractor already on a health authority's list applies to open in a rural area.
<P>
The Staffordshire dispensing doctors, who are attempting to close down a recently-opened pharmacy which they claim jeopardises the survival of their surgery, fought off an attempt to stop the case last Thursday.
<P>
The doctors are attempting to overturn a decision to allow the pharmacy to open near their practice at Moss Lane, Madeley. Dr Worthington claims that if Rajesh Morjaria's shop in Newcastle Road, Madeley, is allowed to remain in business, their own dispensing trade, which provides over 40 per cent of their income, will be wiped out and the survival of the practice will be threatened.
<P>
Earlier Duncan Ouseley QC, counsel for Mr Morjaria, had argued the case should be stopped as the GPs had delayed in bringing their action, and his client had already taken a lease of his shop and incurred substantial expenses by the time they obtained leave to go to the High Court on April 30
<P>
But Philip Havers QC, counsel for Dr Worthington and his partners, said they had brought their challenge within the three-month time limit allowed in judicial review cases.
<P>
After hearing both counsels, Justice Ognall rejected Mr Ouseley's submission that the case should be thrown out. But he said as the case would now be heard by different judges, Mr Ouseley would be free to re-argue the question of delay at the full hearing.
<P>
<li>The battle between the GPs and Mr Morjaria has a long and tortuous history. The pharmacist first applied to Staffordshire Family Health Services Authority to open a pharmacy in Madeley on February 11, 1994. The application was refused, and a second application was also turned down in March last year.
<P>
Mr Morjaria appealed against the second refusal and won his case on February 1 this year.Two months later, the GPs won leave to seek judicial review, but even before Mr Morjaria won his appeal, the doctors had already been taking legal action to challenge the FHSA's decision to even consider his second application.
<P>
Dr Worthington's case, together with the North Humberside one, will now be heard on November 18. Both Staffordshire Health Authority and the Appeal Authority have said they will accept the ruling of the court.

<H3><B>New ways to record private prescriptions</B></H3>
<P>

The Medicines Control Agency is proposing to relax the current legal requirement for pharmacists to keep records of the sale or supply of private prescriptions in a bound book. 
<P>
The proposal, outlined in MLX230 issued this week, has the support of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society and will allow pharmacists to keep records on microfilm, microfiche and computer to reflect developments in information technology. The proposals apply to veterinary and human medicines.
<P>
The change involves amending the definition of 'register' in the Regulations and replacing it with references to written or computerised records. The MCA plans to implement the changes by April. Comments on the proposals should be made by January 3 to Ms Tasneem Baloch, MCA, Room 1620, Market Towers, 1 Nine Elms Lane, London SW8 5NQ.
<P>
<li>The Committee on Safety of Medicines is supporting proposals in MLX 228 to extend the range of Prescription Only Medicines supplied by registered chiropodists. Chiropodists are already authorised to supply a range of P and GSL medicines and to administer certain local anaesthetics.

<H3><B>Council tells PRS of Health Plus concerns</B></H3>
<P>

The Royal Pharmaceutical Society's Council is to write to Practice Resource Systems about its concerns over the Health Plus Manager system. Council's concerns include:
<li>the system could interfere with and obstruct full integration into the proposed NHS-Net
<li>no clinical data would be provided (which Council considered a barrier to pharmacists' development of medication management)
<li>additional benefits over existing systems were unclear
<li>such a system could lead to GPs directing patients to participating pharmacies
<li>a check that a repeat prescription was required where it occurred at the point of delivery would not comply with the standards set by Council and could encourage dispensing of unwanted medicines
<li>if dispensing occurred before a hard copy prescription arrived, pharmacists might not be sure that legal requirements for the prescription were met
<li>difficulties in ensuring patients completed the declaration on levy-exempt prescriptions.

<H3><B>New discount rate effective from next month</B></H3>
<P>

A new discount rate for pharmacy contractors in England and Wales comes into effect from December. The Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee has agreed to extend the new rate until June 30 for the under-clawback of discount to be recovered from NHS contractors.
<P>
The current discount scale recovers 7.87 per cent of the  standard discount rated net ingredient cost (SDR NIC). The new rate will be on average 1 per cent higher. However, to reflect the results of the April discount inquiry the changes will vary from -0.21 per cent to +1.27 per cent.
<P>
The current clawback scale is lower than the 1995-96 target rate as it incorporates a repayment of discount over-recovered up to October 30. The average 1 per cent increase from December reflects a move from a period of under-recovery (ie repayment) to a period of over-recovery.

<H3><B>SCRIPTS costs will be met</B></H3>
<P>

Scottish contractors who change to the SCRIPTS system for the  pricing of prescriptions should not be out of pocket. 
<P>
The Scottish Office has agreed to negotiate with the pharmacy  software suppliers to ensure that contractors will not have to meet the costs of making existing software compatible with SCRIPTS, or any software modifications needed as a result of future developments. Communications software, modems and bar-code readers will be provided at no cost to contractors.
<P>
The Scottish Office has made it clear to the Scottish Pharmaceutical General Council that there is no compulsion to move to a SCRIPTS compatible system and that it will be for individuals to decide whether or not to participate. The SPGC warns that using SCRIPTS will not result in earlier payments from health boards.
<P>
There is still a question mark over whether the new system will save time. The SPGC has no information on how changing to SCRIPTS will affect pharmacists' workload. Colin Virden, SPGC secretary, says that there will be no further discussion on remuneration for using SCRIPTS. It will be up to pharmacists to decide if it offers any advantages.
<P>
When using SCRIPTS, contractors transmit prescription data for pricing electronically. Most of the information required is already input by those who use computerised patient medication records. But contractors also have to record the serial number of the prescription and the GP's reference number. Endorsements which would normally be written on the form have to be coded electronically, as do any alterations to the script.
<P>
To ease data capture, doctors' prescription pads will be reprinted from December with the prescription and GP numbers shown as bar codes. Contractors will have to keep the prescription forms, together with a back-up disk of data they have transmitted, until the Pharmacy Practice Division requests the prescriptions and/or disk, or sanctions their disposal. 
<P>
The SPGC's Central Checking Unit has not yet had any priced prescriptions which have been  through the SCRIPTS system, so cannot verify that items are priced to an acceptable standard.

<H3><B>GP repeat prescribing 'wasteful and dangerous'</B></H3>
<P>

Many medical practices have inadequate controls for repeat prescribing, leading to unauthorised repeat scripts and poor compliance checks, according to a report published in this month's British Journal of General Practice. 
<P>
Sixty-six per cent of repeat drugs showed no evidence of authorisation by a doctor and 72 per cent showed no evidence of  having been reviewed in the previous 15 months, according to Leeds GP Dr Arnold Zermansky. 'Inadequate control of repeat prescribing is wasteful and potentially dangerous,' he concludes. He calls for major improvements in procedures, which 'may require more resources and the imaginative use of nurses and pharmacists'.

<H3><B>Boots unfazed by new force</B></H3>

<P>
Boots is confident it can beat off the challenge that the successful bidder for Lloyds Chemists would bring. Unichem's Moss chain has about 420 outlets, while Gehe's AAH has about 300. Either would overtake Boots as the UK's largest pharmacy group if its bid succeeds. But Lord Blyth, Boots' deputy chairman and chief executive, says the new retailing force would not change matters. 'Lloyds has been out there as a pretty serious competitor for some time. It's unlikely that the retail dynamic of the situation will change,' he says.
<P>
That did not mean Boots was complacent. 'Boots has contingency plans to deal with the winning bidder of Lloyds. But it's not costing us sleepless nights.'
<P>
Lord Blyth adds that Unichem could have trouble meeting its goals. 'Unichem says it plans to sell about 100 Lloyds' stores. That will be a lot more difficult to do than it is to say. And it will not change the competitive situation.'
<P>
Lord Blyth's comments came as Boots unveiled a 9.4 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to 239.2 million, before exceptionals, for the six months to September 30. Its turnover grew 12.2 per cent to 2,120.4 billion. Boots the Chemists' profits grew 12 per cent to 184m on a turnover that rose 6.3 per cent to 1,539.2m. Counter sales were up over 5 per cent and dispensing sales nearly 10 per cent.
<P>
Boots says BTC's overall performance was held back by relatively low sales of sun-related goods, due to the poor summer. However, the company says new own-brands, such as analgesics, smoking cessation, vitamins and contraception, fuelled an 8 per cent hike in healthcare sales.
<P>
Beauty and personal care sales grew 7 per cent due to 'excellent sales increases' from counter cosmetics, skin care and fragrance. Boots' cosmetics range, No7, continued its progress with sales up nearly 17 per cent. 
<P>
Lord Blyth says the company is delighted with customers' response to Persona. 'In recent weeks, it's been the single best-selling item in Boots' stores and we're delighted to have exclusive representation of it. If you want a definition of success - that's it.'
<P>
Like other employers, however, Boots is under pressure to recruit pharmacists from a dwindling pool. Steve Russell, BTC's managing director, admits the company is under pressure to motivate and manage its staff. 'We just have to keep managing more skilfully and to use our pharmacy staff to better effect,' he says. 'They do too much administration work, so we want them to spend more time on the healthcare side, like giving advice to consumers.'
<P>
Sir Michael Angus, Boots' chairman, emphasises its commitment to retaining Resale Price Maintenance. 'We believe that RPM should remain in force because consumer interests are best served by retaining the service to local communities currently provided by pharmacists.'
<P>
But Boots remains 'well placed' to withstand the impact if the Government abolished RPM. 'In the event of competitive price-cutting, following a decision to end RPM, only a small proportion of BTC sales would be affected,' he says.
<P>
Meanwhile, Sir Michael welcomes the Primary Care bill, saying Boots had been talking to the Government 'for many months' about its contents. 'We're grateful about the new depth of understanding revealed in the White Paper. We see clear evidence that the pharmacist has a clear role in the community. We see an expansion of self-medication - that is something BTC has been working on. We find the whole situation pretty encouraging.'
<P>
Boots Healthcare International's sales grew 11 per cent to 110.7m and it made a profit of 1m, down 1.4m on its profit over the same period last year. Boots says it spent about 35m on product launches, including Strepsils Throat Spray, product development and marketing support.

<H3><B>Labour lays claim to be rural ally</B></H3>
<P>

Pharmacists in dispensing doctor areas may have an ally in the new Shadow minister for public health, Labour member of parliament Kevin Barron.
<P>
'My sympathies lie with the local pharmacists,' he said, describing the 'war of attrition' between dispensing doctors and rural pharmacists as 'an incredible eye-opener'.
<P>
Mr Barron was speaking at a one-day conference organised by the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee, Royal Pharmaceutical Society and the Pharmaceutical Advisers Group at the NEC, Birmingham, last Thursday. He was giving his first speech on a subject connected with pharmacies since being given community pharmacy as part of his front-bench brief two months ago. He also has responsibility for Labour's pharmaceutical industry brief.
<P>
He told delegates of his experience in visiting a site where a dispensing doctor was complaining that a pharmacy was affecting his viability. 'If anything, the threat was on the other boot - the reason the pharmacy wasn't growing was because of the doctor dispensing,' he said.
<P>
The Shadow minister began his speech by saying that he had only had the community pharmacy brief for a few weeks. 'I am happy to admit that I am still learning about pharmacy, and community pharmacy in particular. I hope that we can build a healthy dialogue,' he said.
<P>
'I want to see greater emphasis put on the role that pharmacists can play in the community and I would be especially interested to hear how you think Government can do that,'

<H3><B>Dietary supplements category proposed</B></H3>
<P>
A new system for regulating dietary supplements was proposed last week by Anthony Bush, chairman, Health Food Manufacturers' Association. The aim is to clarify the grey area between medicines and foods by creating a special category for health products.
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing in London, Mr Bush proposed a notification system which would form part of food law, not medicines legislation. It would cover dietary supplements, single herbs, mixtures of herbs and herbs with nutrients. Health products would be defined as products for the maintenance and promotion of health, which were taken in addition to normal nutrition and healthcare without being legally classified as medicinal products. 
<P>
Companies would have to ensure that products conformed to acceptable safety standards, with assessment by appropriately qualified experts. The products would have to be manufactured under good manufacturing practice and reach acceptable quality standards. Because consumers would need to make informed choices about which products to take, there would be a list of permitted health claims, backed by scientific evidence. 
<P>
The information would be held centrally so that it could be accessed easily if a product recall was needed.  A similar system is already operating in Belgium and Holland. Mr Bush said that governments should be encouraging the health products sector as a means of reducing health service costs.  ''If we are to promote self care we need to inform consumers of the benefits of health products - making health claims (not medicinal claims) in a framework which guarantees safety, honesty and quality,'' he said. 
<P>
The proposed system has the support of the Consumers' Association and is being discussed with the Department of Health, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and with the European Commission. Maurice Hanssen, director of the Council for Responsible Nutrition, said it was a nonsense that use of a health product for preventing a disease made that product into a medicine, particularly as governments were trying to encourage preventive medicine and self care. 
<P>
An international panel of experts is trying to identify safe levels of micro-nutrients as there is evidence that their preventive effects are seen at much higher levels than the current RDAs. The CRN is an association of 15 leading suppliers of food supplements. 
<P>
<UL>
<LH></LH>
<LI>The Consumers' Association is to seek tighter controls on labelling and claims made for dietary supplements. In a report to be published next month, the Association calls for upper limits on the ingredients allowed in cases where safety problems have already been identified, together with a compulsory notification system enabling product details to be held centrally. The CA publication Health Which? says that many people are fooled into believing they are buying medicines rather than food supplements. Companies are stretching the law by using brand names, packaging and shelf positioning to hint at medical benefits, the report says. The companies get away with it because the products fall into a shady area between food and medicine law

<H3><B>No pay deal yet for England and Wales</B></H3>
<P>
The NHS Executive has still to come up with a final pay offer for pharmacy contractors in England and Wales. Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee chairman Wally Dove has accused the NHSE of dragging its feet. PSNC has pressed hard at all levels, and has not adopted an extreme position, he says. ''We have taken a businesslike and realistic approach. We should have settled by now.''
<P>
An imposed pay settlement may be on the cards if agreement cannot be reached soon. The sticking points are the final level of the global sum and PSNC's insistence that something must be done about late payment. The Committee has already rejected a 3 per cent offer, and is understood to be seeking parity with family doctors at 3.13 per cent  <A HREF="http://www.dotpharmacy.co.uk/may25.html">May 25</A>
<P>
However, with ministers now away for the summer, it may be some weeks before a decision is made. A DoH insider said ministers hoped to reach agreement with the profession. Progress has been made over the late payment issue, he said, but admitted that concessions might not go as far as the pharmacy profession would like.

<H3><B>CPP plans changes to membership rules</B></H3>
<P>

The College of Pharmacy Practice is introducing changes to its membership by examination scheme on January 1, 1997. Under the new scheme, which will ultimately replace the current system, aspiring members will have to work through compulsory modules to accrue 60 credits.  To attain membership by exam, a further 40 credits will be needed, which can be obtained from either externally assessed qualifications, such as <EM>C&D</EM>'s Pharmacy Update, or from a selection of non-compulsory modules.
<P>
There will be a two year transition period where both schemes will run concurrently. Candidates who do not plan to complete the old system before it is phased out at the end of 1998 will be able to transfer to the new scheme. The compulsory modules under the new scheme will be general therapeutics (10 credits), pharmacy practice, law and ethics (10), practice scenarios (20), and either practice reports or a practice research project (20).

<H3><B>Restriction on terfenadine</B></H3>
<P>

Terfenadine is set to become a Prescription Only Medicine for children under 12. Amyl nitrite is also included in P to POM changes proposed by the Medicines Control Agency in a consultation letter, MLX 225, issued this week. If accepted, the changes would come into effect by December 31. 
<P>
The MCA has included terfenadine after receiving advice from the Committee on Safety of Medicines over the cardiotoxicity of the drug, relative to other non-sedating antihistamines. Its interaction with erythromycin, a drug of 'frequent use' in children, was also considered an important factor. 
<P>
The addition of amyl nitrite comes a month after the Royal Pharmaceutical Society prosecuted a sex shop for unlawful sale of isobutyl nitrites <A HREF="http://www.dotpharmacy.co.uk/jun29.html"> June 29</A>
<P>
The MCA proposals also include POM to P changes. Famotidine will see an extension to its licensed indications to include ''prevention of indigestion and acid indigestion when associated with food or beverage, including nocturnal symptoms''. The POM to P proposals have been welcomed by the Proprietary Association of Great Britain. ''It has been shown that extending the indication for any given over the counter medicine boosts sales. This is because the message is getting through to the consumer,'' says PAGB director Sheila Kelly
<P>
Other POM to P proposals are:

<H3><B>EC draft directive raises cost concerns</B></H3>
<P>

The European Commission is pressing ahead with formal consultations on a draft directive on the conduct of clinical trials. The Medicines Control Agency is concerned that the cost of implementing the directive outweighs possible benefits. ''We are anxious to ensure that this important aspect of its impact is not overlooked,'' says Margaret Jackman, the MCA unit manager who is co-ordinating the UK response. 
<P>
The Agency is asking companies to complete a questionnaire so it can gauge the likely costs and potential delays the directive might impose on clinical trials. The timetable is tight, with replies needed by August 22. The MCA is assuming the directive will regulate phase 1, or 'healthy volunteer' trials, and also trials involving medicines already licensed. It is not intended to cover medical devices.
<P>
The draft directive proposes new procedures for reporting adverse events and introduces the inspection of trials sites and sponsor organisations.

<H3><B>Pharmacists oppose Cheltenham 'super-surgery'</B></H3>
<P>

Pharmacists in Cheltenham are fighting a proposed 26 doctor health centre incorporating a pharmacy, amid fears that seven pharmacies would be forced to close. Five GP practices are planning to relocate to a central site in the town. The 'super-surgery' will generate an estimated 300,000 prescriptions a year.
<P>
The original plan to include the surgery on the six acre town centre redevelopment site was rejected at a planning meeting held last Wednesday. However, the council is receptive to the idea of having a centralised health facility, covering approximately one acre, and will be meeting with the doctors to see if separate plans for the surgery can be advanced. 
<P>
Local pharmacists are opposing the move as they believe that they will lose prescriptions and customer sales. They are also arguing that the central site will be inconvenient for patients. Pharmacy proprietor Peter Badham has co-ordinated the opposition to the scheme. He is dismayed that the council is still keen to pursue the surgery complex. 
<P>
A 12,500 signature petition opposing the health centre has been presented to Cheltenham Borough Council, but this was ''brushed to one side'', according to Mr Badham. ''A lot of people do not want to lose their local chemist or doctor,'' he says. The project co-ordinator appointed by the doctors, Brian Jones, counters this argument by saying that the five surgeries relocating to the complex are all moving less than a mile. He predicts that satellite surgeries will still deal with 25 per cent of the patients.
<P>
Taking pharmacists' agreements with residential and nursing homes, and the number of repeat prescriptions which are not time-critical, Mr Jones estimates that only about 70,000 items would go through the pharmacy in the complex. He insists the new complex will offer easier access for the elderly and disabled with better parking facilities and access from bus routes. The centre aims to provide physiotherapy, chiropody and laboratory services. 
<P>
The doctors are supporting a minor relocation of the Triocare pharmacy to the complex. This business put forward the best proposals when all the town's pharmacies were invited to tender to provide a pharmacy service at the complex. Gloucestershire Health Authority says that two pharmacies have been granted minor relocation applications, one of which is known to be in Mr Badham's name. The HA rejected five main inclusion applications. 
<P>
Cheltenham's director of policy and regeneration, Tony Morgan, says: ''We are still at a stage where a group of chemists have made a case and doctors have made a counter-argument - we have yet to see all the arguments presented.''
<P>
Mr Badham is pressing for the council to employ an independent agency to conduct a survey into the impact the opening the complex would have on pharmacies.

<H3><B>Labour extends RPM petition deadline</B></H3>
<P>

The deadline for return of the Labour Party's petitions supporting resale price maintenance has been extended to the end of August, following a 'huge' response from pharmacists and MPs. A spokesman for Nigel Griffith's office, which initiated the campaign <A HREF="http://www.dotpharmacy.co.uk/jul13.html">July 13</A>  said he had a 'two foot pile' of signed petitions sitting in the corner and large numbers were still being collected by MPs.
<P>
The petition, devised with input from the National Pharmaceutical Association, appeals for the government not to take any action which might jeopardise the future of local pharmacies. Labour MPs were asked to circulate the petitions to pharmacies.The campaign has received much coverage in local newspapers.

<H3><B>Pharmacy Healthcare Scheme's future secure</B></H3>
<P>
The Pharmacy Healthcare Scheme has secured a Department of Health tender to provide health promotion services through pharmacies, guaranteeing its future for a further three years. Post-tender negotiations are to get under way with the NHS Executive shortly to agree contractual arrangements.
<P>
The PHS' secretary, Saskia Zeelenberg, feels the award is an endorsement of the work the PHS has done over the past ten years. "It's nice that the Department has recognised that the profession is able to do the work it wants to see done in the field of health promotion," she says.
<P>
The DoH has previously allocated 200,000-300,000 for pharmacy health promotion, split between the PHS and another candidate shortlisted for the tender, the Health Education Authority. It is expected that budgets will remain the same, but with the funding falling solely into the PHS' hands.
<P>
This, coupled with a reduction in the number of health promotion leaflets produced - from 12 to eight a year - will free the PHS to expand and diversify. "The tender document had a lot of new, totally fresh ideas," adds Ms Zeelenberg.
<P>
Under the contract, PHS will evaluate the health promotion service, improve distribution and undertake to inform pharmacists and produce relevant materials to do so. There is a possibility of recruiting further staff for the two-person team, which is based at the Royal Pharmaceutical Society's headquarters.
<P>
The Society's secretary and registrar, John Ferguson, is confident that negotiations will be completed successfully. With these agreed, "the Scheme will continue to be driven by the profession and, thus, have the support of all community and hospital pharmacists".
<P>
The tender was to "identify topics suitable for health promotion through pharmacies facilitating public access to health promotion literature in pharmacies and evaluating the impact of its services".

<H3><B>Reassurance over BSE in medicines fear</B></H3>
<P>
Medicines containing cattle-derived products do not represent a risk of transmitting bovine spongiform encephalopathy, says the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry. 
<P>
The ABPI points out that the pharmaceutical industry has complied with the Committee on Safety of Medicines' guidelines of 1989, and with the 1992 European Union guidelines, which remain under active review.
<P>
The Department of Health says it is satisfied that there is no risk to the public from medicines containing beef products. The chief medical officer, Sir Kenneth Calman, has issued a statement to public health directors, to be distributed to doctors, advising that gelatin is safe for use in pharmaceutical and medical devices.
<P>
The gelatin manufacturers' association discounts the link between BSE and gelatin, and is backed by R P Scherer- the UK's leading manufacturer of gelatin capsules- Eli Lilly and Seven Seas.
<P>
Scherer says gelatin is derived from bones, hide or skin, which have not been shown to harbour the BSE infective agent. Scherer adds that its suppliers do not use raw material from the UK; most comes from continental Europe, or countries where no case of BSE has been officially declared.
<P>
In a written Commons answer, health minister John Horam said currently-licensed vaccines in the UK did not contain any bovine material sourced here.
<P>
Novo Nordisk says that, in a trial, no traces of a deliberately introduced SE pathogen could be detected after the fourth stage of its standard 15-stage insulin purification process.
<P>
CP Pharmaceuticals, manufacturer of Hypurin beef insulin, derived from the pancreas, says this organ has a low risk of infectivity with regard to spongiform encephalopathies. This is also the case for its heparin products, derived from lung and intestine, and hyaluronidase, from testes.
<P>
 The chief medical officer has a recorded information message on BSE and CJD on 0800 344355.

<H3><B>Go-ahead for NI rural dispensing guidelines</B></H3>
<P>
Amendments to Northern Ireland's rural dispensing guidelines come into force this week, after a five-month delay (C&D November 4, p648; November 11, p683).
<P>
The guidance to the Province's four health boards means only patients who live more than five kilometres (3.1 miles) from a pharmacy should normally be considered for inclusion on a doctor's dispensing list. Previously, the limit was two miles. 
<P>
A patient who is normally able to attend the doctor's surgery should not be included on the list if the surgery is within one kilometre (0.61 miles) of the nearest pharmacy and that pharmacy provides a comprehensive collection and delivery service for patients.
<P>
However, there is scope within the guidelines for individual cases to be considered by the health board. Plans are also being put in place to introduce a scheme to protect the viability of the 30 dispensing doctor practices. In addition, the NI Department of Health is considering how GP services should be made subject to the same dispensing standards as pharmacies.
<P>
The Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland's Dr Terry Maguire welcomes the March 29 implementation. "The profession has been waiting for this for some time, we are delighted it has now come about."
<P>
He is anxious to dispel negative press reports that doctors and patients will suffer. "This is not a competition between pharmacists and doctors, it's merely improving choice for patients in rural areas."
<P>
<H3>Market town dilemma returns</H3>
<P>
The market town situation in Great Britain has reared its head again, giving new impetus to the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee's push to alter Regulations to prevent future occurrences.
<P>
Both GP surgeries in Daventry, Northamptonshire, have obtained dispensing rights for patients living more than a mile from the town, despite the presence of four pharmacies. 
<P>
The original applications were refused in May, 1994, on the grounds that they would prejudice pharmaceutical services. However, this was overturned by the Appeals Unit last December and one practice will start dispensing in May.
<P>
The PSNC's assistant secretary, Mike King, says it is a prime example of the situation it is trying to stop. "It's an absolute nonsense that you have a doctors' practice being granted permission to dispense in proximity to other pharmacies."

<H3><B>Steroids rescheduled as CDs</B></H3>
<P>
In a bid to stamp out abuse by athletes and body-builders, steroids will be controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 from this autumn, the Home Office has announced.
<P>
Anabolic and androgenic steroids, some polypeptide hormones and the adrenoceptor stimulant, clenbuterol, have been listed in a modification order to the MDA, due to come into effect on September 1.
<P>
The changes will make the drugs class C category and bring them into Schedule 4 of the MDA, so that there are no special safe storage, handwriting or record-keeping requirements. However, there will be no exemption from import and export licence controls.
<P>
The changes will make it an offence to produce, supply, import or export with intent to supply the specified drugs without authority to do so.It is believed that unlawful possession of an amount for personal use will not be made a criminal act, but this may have to be decided by the courts.

<H3><B>Moss shines as Unichem profits grow by 12%</B></H3>
<P>
Unichem reported a 12 per cent jump in profits for 1995, a year of "notable achievement", says chief executive, Jeffery Harris.
<P>
Turnover increased 6 per cent to 1,403 million for the year to December 31, 1995; operating profits rose 14 per cent to 53.3m, with pre-tax profits rising to 49.4m. The proposed dividend per share climbed to 8p per share up from 7.13p in 1994.
<P>
The Moss chain turned in a strong performance, adding 70 new units in 1995, taking the total to 423. The division turned in a 48 per cent increase in operating profits, which stood at 12.3m for the year.
<P>
The number of Moss pharmacies operating in superstores expanded, with new contracts  with Asda, Somerfield, Morrisons and Waitrose bringing the total number of in-store pharmacies operated by Moss to 65.
<P>
Sales grew 37 per cent to 208.5m. "The Moss emphasis on healthcare services and OTC medicines is primarily responsible for better performance than the market in general in both NHS and OTC categories," says the company.
<P>
Like for like turnover from NHS dispensing increased 9 per cent; total turnover from dispensing grew 42 per cent, giving Moss a 4 per cent market share.Moss turned in like for like growth of 15 per cent in Pharmacy medicines, 7 per cent in GSL medicines and 4 per cent in toiletries. Within the toiletries category, it was healthcare-oriented products that performed best. 
<P>
During the year, the Moss Chemists' management team completed a major strategic review on the future of retail pharmacy. The recommendations from that are now being implemented and involve initiatives on the positioning of shops and projects to improve Moss Chemists' retail activities. 
<P>
These projects will ensure that outlets are running "sharper and smarter", says Barry Andrews, Moss retail director. They include stock balancing, tiered pricing, re-ranging shops to fit with local product demand, best practice staffing and proper profile refits. 
<P>
There are no significant capital or revenue costs involved, but there will be a beneficial effect on profits from 1997 onwards.
<P>
The retail division continues to look at a "significant number" of acquisition opportunities.
<P>
The wholesaling division saw major benefits from the installation of new systems and technology, with sales rising 4 per cent to 1.3 billion. Operating profit for the division rose to 39m, from 37.1m in 1994.
<P>
Like for like growth in prescription pharmaceuticals was 6 per cent, but OTC product sales were down on last year, caused by continuing market weakness and by a period of poor customer service earlier in the year.
<P>
Operating margins moved ahead, despite weak performance in the first half, buoyed by second half margins that were the highest ever achieved by the division.
<P>
The introduction of an inventory management system and a warehouse restructuring programme means the business has "a sound platform for further growth in 1996. Market prospects remain encouraging and we are confident of further growth in revenue and operating margins", says the company.
<P>
Unichem remains "strongly positive" about the future and plans to "expand core businesses and develop into related healthcare markets".
<P>
Last year saw the launch of Unichem's healthcare agency business with a contract from Smith & Nephew, and Unichem sees "significant opportunities ... to extend this service to other manufacturers".
<P>
The company says that it remains confident of a favourable outcome to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission investigation into its bid for Lloyds Chemists.
<P>
Last year also saw a number of deals in Europe. The merger with Alliance Salute, a major wholesaler in Italy and France, announced in November, will be completed shortly. Unichem also incorporated Unichem Healthcare (Netherlands) as a wholly-owned subsidiary, "with the intention that it will become the holding company to manage European interests".
<P>
<H3>Gehe bid for Lloyds joins Unichem's under UK scrutiny</H3>
<P>
The European Commission has referred the Gehe bid to take over Lloyds Chemists back to the UK authorities. 
<P>
It is now widely expected that the secretary of state for Trade and Industry will refer the Gehe deal to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, a move that will "have the advantage of allowing both bids [Unichem and Gehe] to be examined by the same regulatory authority on a co-ordinated timetable", says the EC.
<P>
If this occurs, Gehe's offer will lapse as has Unichem's, and the authorities will have until the end of June to report on the proposed mergers.
<P>
The Commission referred the bid back for a number of reasons; one being that, after the merger, Gehe/Lloyds and Unichem would be the only two wholesalers supplying a full range of products throughout the UK. Based on current evidence, says the Commission, regional wholesalers would appear unable to provide a sufficient competitive counterweight to such a duopoly.
<P>
The Commission also says that it has identified a small number of areas where pharmacies belonging to the AAH and Lloyds pharmacy chains would appear to have a local monopoly.
<P>
Furthermore, the Commission considers that, because Gehe/Lloyds would be a leading wholesaler and retailer, this could affect the supply of pharmaceutical products to independents competing at a retail level with the group's own outlets.
<P>
Gehe says that it has noted the EC decision and will wait to see whether the deal is referred to the MMC before making any further announcement.

<H3><B>'Positive influence' from Medihealth</B></H3>
<P>
Medihealth, the new pharmaceutical distributor, will be a "positive influence to support community pharmacists", according to corporate marketing director Malcolm Davies.
<P>
The company recognises that the pharmacists' role is changing, says Mr Davies, and to "fulfil their destiny as front-line healthcare advisers pharmacists must generate higher margins". 
<P>
Medihealth is hoping to help pharmacists by supplying products that enhance margins, including imported ethicals (PIs) and a portfolio of generics. It is also looking to develop a range of branded generics. The company will specialise in medicines and will not distribute toiletries but, Mr Davies stresses, Medihealth is not a short line wholesaler.
<P>
Medihealth bought Spectrum  earlier this year, "which was the first step in establishing Medihealth as a specialist sales and distribution company", says Mr Davies. The company is aiming to reach the top 5,000 pharmacies (those with the largest turnover) nationwide "as quickly as possible". This may be through acquisition or organic growth of the current sales force.

<H3><B>Leeds University gets pharmacy department</B></H3>
<P>
Yorkshire Pharmacy Academic Practice Unit is to be integrated into the University of Leeds. The new division of Academic Pharmacy Practice will not be the University's first department dedicated to pharmacy - the School of Pharmacy within the Faculty of Medicine closed at the end of the 1960s, but had one of the UK's smallest intakes.  The division  will be part of the new School of Healthcare Studies and will be headed by pharmacist Dr Theo Raynor.
<P>
The division is keen to promote research, and key areas will include written patient information, chronic pain management in the community and pharmaceutical care at the hospital/community interface.

<H3><B>Call to lobby OFT on medicines RPM</B></H3>
<P>
Independent pharmacy contractors are being urged to write again to the Office of Fair Trading to support the retention of Resale Price Maintenance and counter the latest onslaught by Asda.
<P>
Meanwhile, in the House of Lords on Tuesday, Baroness Gardner of Parkes asked the Government what steps it was taking to ensure the continuance of independent pharmacy in view of the referral of RPM to the OFT.
<P>
Trade and Industry minister Lord Fraser pointed out to the House that "clearly, the existence of the present exemption would reveal that there is good reason for there being such an exemption".
<P>
Baroness Gardner pressed the minister on the importance of  local pharmacies in both the social fabric of the country and the NHS. Lord Fraser responded that it was a complex matter and that the OFT anticipated taking until September to complete its review.
<P>
National Pharmaceutical Association director Tim Astill, on behalf of the Community Pharmacy Action Group, comments: "We understand that the Government cannot commit itself at this stage, but we found the comments from both the Government and the Opposition most encouraging."
<P>
Last week, Nick Cooper, Asda's corporate counsel, criticised the time being taken by the OFT and said the company was taking the fight to the European Commission (C&D April 20, p536). He described RPM as another outmoded piece of "junk law".
<P>
He added: "No one doubts the social need for pharmacy services to be accessible. That is why we are trying to add to the pharmacies we already have in our stores, although we are limited in doing so by pharmacy licence restrictions.
<P>
"We do not accept that everyone - old people, the sick and the young - should have to pay a hidden tax on their cold cures and vitamins through higher prices and exorbitant profit margins for large multinational companies," he said.
<P>
In response to the attack, pharmacy leaders see it as vital that as many pharmacists as possible join the fight to preserve RPM. David Sharpe, chairman of the RPM defence organisation the Community Pharmacy Action Group, says: "This is a very important battle against the supermarkets and one we must win.
<P>
"Remuneration year by year will increase even if it's a low margin. If RPM goes, it goes once and for all and there will be a decrease year by year," warns Mr Sharpe.
<P>
Community pharmacists are urged to write to their MP and the OFT, rather than the Department of Health. Mr Sharpe is advising independents to take note of requests by the OFT, Field House, 15 Breams Buildings London EC4A 1PR for further information and to obtain specialised help from the CPAG in drafting a response.
<P>
The OFT is still consulting retailers, wholesalers and manufacturers prior to meeting with the DoH, probably in July.
<P>
Earlier this month, DoH chief pharmacist Bryan Hartley acknowledged: "Retail Price Maintenance is a serious professional issue, not just commercial: about 11 per cent of the turnover is from OTC products; 20 per cent of the profit is from OTCs."
<P>
The UK 200 Healthcare Group of chartered accountants predicted gloomily this week: "The buying power of retail groups, such as Asda, will place the smaller independent under extreme competitive pressure and failures must follow. Some sources suggest that this could put as many as 30 per cent of independents out of business."
<P>
For further advice, pharmacists are recommended to contact Sue Sharpe at the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, Godfrey Horridge at the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee or Tim Astill at the National Pharmaceutical Association.

<H3><B>Wally Dove takes over PSNC chairmanship</B></H3>
<P>
Wally Dove moves from vice chairman to chairman of the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee, replacing David Sharpe.
<P>
"I would like to say to contractors that I do not underestimate the job and I intend to give it my best shot," vows Mr Dove, the sole candidate for the position. He stresses his intention to work very closely with PSNC's new vice chairman Steven Williams, the Committee's Mersey representative. 
<P>
"I am sure that the profession is waiting for all the answers to all of its questions in the first couple of meetings, but I think that the job is rather more complicated and difficult than that," says Mr Dove.
<P>
His predecessor for 18 years, David Sharpe, has already pledged his support. "I wish him every luck and success in what will be a thankless task. He is very much his own man and I expect him to lead from the front," says Mr Sharpe.
<P>
The National Pharmaceutical Association's director, Tim Astill, says the organisation's Board extends its unanimous congratulations and good wishes to Mr Dove. "I know that the PSNC has made a good choice and I am sure he will do a good job."
<P>
John Ferguson, secretary and registrar of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, comments: "I look forward to working closely with him."

<H3><B>40% rise in Lincs needle funding</B></H3>
<P>
The pharmacist-run north Lincolnshire needle exchange facility has negotiated a 40 per cent funding increase from South Humber Health Authority.
<P>
The rise gives Freelance Needle Exchange 63,000 to spend on providing all syringe exchange services within south Humberside. The limited company, run by pharmacist directors Tim Cottingham and Dr Rod Tucker, has also secured a 12-month renewal of its contract.
<P>
Mr Cottingham says that the past year saw client visits to the company's 16 sites (13 of which are pharmacies) increase by 58 per cent to 11,325. The number of syringes issued rose by 48 per cent to over 166,000.
<P>
He adds that the funding will take into account an expected rise in client visits and needles supplied, as well as increased  fees for pharmacists. There will be a minimum payment of 1.25 per visit, rising to 1.50 paid per visit to the busier sites which offer a full range of equipment.Last year saw a used needle return rate of 73 per cent.

Posters and leaflets will be distributed to pharmacies, GP surgeries and schools via the School Nurses Association.

The new version clarifies the previous amendments to the FP10, making it easier to read, and moving the prescription payment declaration to the top of the form. 
<P>
The form will include a new exemption box for those people claiming the income-based Job Seekers Allowance. However, the final layout of the form has not been finalised and further modifications may be made.
<P>
Wally Dove, PSNC chairman, says PSNC has seen a copy of the modified FP10 and "in general terms, the Committee is happy". 
<P>
PSNC stresses there are no plans to have pharmacists police the FP10 exemptions and that, contrary to reports, dispensing doctors will be using the same forms and will have the same requirements to have patients indicate that they have paid the prescription fee.
<P>
The new FP10 will be fully implemented by October 7.

<H3><B>PSNI president critical of NHS decision-making tactics</B></H3>
<P>
The way the Government makes policy decisions on health service reforms has come in for harsh criticism from the president of the Pharmaceutical Society of Northern Ireland.
<P>
Pharmacists, in common with other groups within the NHS, have become "disenchanted and disillusioned as they witness the effects of the so-called reforms in the health service", said Terry Hannawin at the annual president's dinner in Belfast last Saturday. They would like to be given some detail of the decision-making process which Government uses when making policy decisions, he suggested.
<P>
"Government is keen to commend evidence-based medicine to healthcare professionals, and one is entitled to assume that when they take major policy decisions they do so after applying the same criteria in the form of evidence-based research."
<P>
Pharmacist are increasingly complaining about the "embarrassing process" of collecting prescription charges, said Mr Hannawin. He recalled the comment of a paying patient who could only afford one of four items on a script: "I know the Government wanted to give us freedom of choice, but I didn't realise they wanted to impose it," she said.
<P>
"Subsidiarity is another frequently used expression when it fits the immediate needs of our political masters," commented the president. In the context of things like the Maastricht Treaty it applies to regulations, "but nearer to home this principle is applied to spending by local health authorities. The Government uses a process of cuts and capping to withdraw effective decision-making".
<P>
Some balance needed to be restored to the Government's policy towards the NHS, said Mr Hannawin. "Government should enable local authorities to take effective evidence-based decisions in the best interests of the populations they serve, rather than preventing them and imposing a specious freedom on patients."
<P>
Pharmacists' intervention contributes significantly to containing the drugs bill, and they could make an even greater contribution, said Mr Hannawin. This could not be a "short-term fix", but something which would be sustainable in the longer-term.
<P>
"It would require courageous and innovative change to the way our service is funded. We would need guaranteed financial incentives as well as freedom to take increased responsibility for our decision-making," he said.
<P>
Structures and resources are already in place, although seriously under-used, so there would be no need for substantial investment to kick-start the process, he said. "We should be exploring the possibilities, and pharmacists would not be found wanting if Government is serious about more cost-effective healthcare."

<H3><B>LIG acquires US condom and glove manufacturer</B></H3>
<P>
London International Group is to become the largest manufacturer of condoms in the US, with the 46 million acquisition of Aladan Corporation, an Alabama-based private company. 
<P>
The purchase will also give LIG a leading market position in examination gloves in the US, the largest medical gloves market in the world. It is paying 34.4m in cash and issuing 4.4 million new shares for Aladan. The deferred consideration, which amounts to 6.3m depends on performance.
<P>
Aladan has net assets of 19.3m and in the year to December made profits of 7m on net sales of 56.9m. 
<P>
Nick Hodges, chief executive of LIG, says: "This is the first major acquisition for LIG since its refinancing and restructuring nearly two years ago. It is a landmark deal in the group's development and provides us with an exciting platform from which to achieve sustainable long-term growth in our core business areas."
<P>
Moving Aladan to a totally powder-free product range will enable LIG to become the world leader in both the powder-free surgical and examination glove segments.

<H3><B>Malone sets up script fraud squad</B></H3>
<P>
A Prescription Fraud Squad is to be created to crack down on patients, GPs and pharmacists who are thought to be cheating the NHS of 30 million a year.
<P>
Health minister Gerald Malone announced this week he would be setting up a 40-strong team of investigators and legal experts to help eliminate malpractice.
<P>
The prescription fraud unit, based at the Prescription Pricing Authority's Newcastle headquarters, will investiage fraud committed by patients and possible malpractice by professional staff.
<P>
Mr Malone said the new FP10s, which require patients to declare the charge paid and the reason for exemption, had made inroads into the problem. The unit will cost 800,000 to set up - "a fraction of the cost of the fraud it is to investigate", said the health minister.
<P>
The Royal Pharmaceutical Society welcomes the initiative, but has stressed its adamant opposition that pharmacists should 'police' prescription exemption claims. "Any such role would be to the detriment of the pharmacist's relationship with patients," says the Society.
<P>
The estimated 30m loss is based on the PPA's sample check of script charge exemptions.

<H3><B>More GPs approve OTC deregulation</B></H3>
<P>
More GPs favour wider availability of certain medicines over the counter, compared to five years ago.
<P>
GPs agreed that in certain cases pharmacists should be able to supply oral nystatin suspension, co-dydramol and chloramphenicol eye drops without prescription, says a report published in the British Medical Journal.
<P>
The study, conducted in 1994, compared how GP attitudes had changed since a similar survey in 1990.OTC co-dydramol (ten tablets) for severe toothache at the weekend was supported by 87 per cent of respondents, and oral nystatin suspension for oral candidosis in babies by 80 per cent.
<P>
The biggest increases in support for OTC status were for the 'morning after pill' and a three day course of trimethoprim for frequency and dysuria in women.
<P>
Dr James Kennedy, senior lecturer in general practice at Charing Cross and Westminster Medical School, supports the trend. In an editorial he says: "The remuneration system for community pharmacists must be adapted to reward those who give accurate advice to patients and liaise with general practitioners."

<H3><B>Society launches managed care document</B></H3>
<P>
Pharmacists have to ensure they are central to the concept of managed care - or watch as the profession becomes marginalised in medication management, warns a new report commissioned by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society.
<P>
'Managing medicines: managing care', by Deloitte and Touche Consulting Group, highlights the increasing drive towards managed care and illustrates the role pharmacists would play in this new age.
<P>
Dr Sue Ambler, the Society's head of practice research, sees the report as a window on the profession, but adds: "A lot of it is laid at the pharmacist's door to meet health authorities and purchasers halfway."
<P>
The document concludes that: "Managed care represents the greatest challenge facing pharmacy today...Pharmacists could, through managed care, be effectively harnessed to address many of the key areas of concern to the NHS." 
<P>
Pharmacists could focus on the added value they bring to patient management which would improve the cost-effectiveness of medicinal therapy. The majority of systems are already in place: formularies, prescribing protocols, generic prescribing and drug utilisation review harnessing PACT and SPA data. 
<P>
The report strongly emphasises that the way the profession jumps lies firmly in its own hands. Pharmacy and its representative bodies should "seize the opportunity and ensure the future of pharmacy at the heart of the healthcare system". Rather than being a reactive profession which waits for purchasers to act, "it should lead the debate on the reinvention of pharmacy and provide pharmacists with the necessary capabilities".
<P>
Failure to do so "may pose a real threat to pharmacy and the profession could become marginalised".
<P>
"Managing medicines: managing care" is being sent to health authority chairmen, chief executives, pharmaceutical advisors and health policy research groups, as well as the pharmacy organisations and schools of pharmacy. Pharmacists who wish to receive copies, at a cost of 7.50, should contact: Anita Constable on 0171 735 9141.

<H3><B>Wholesale sector has reached national-regional equilibrium</B></H3>
<P>
The wholesale sector appears to have reached an equilibrium between national and regional players. Recent events "would seem to indicate that the Department of Health is keen to maintain this status quo", according to David Linney, chairman of the British Association of Pharmaceutical Wholesalers.
<P>
Speaking at the BAPW's annual dinner on Monday, he implied that the Department had a hand in the referral of the two competing bids for Lloyds Chemists to the Monopolies Commission.
<P>
The principle threat currently facing wholesalers is the removal of resale price maintenance on medicines, he said, although he believed the odds have moved from 50:50 to 60:40 in favour of its retention.
<P>
The introduction of patient packs is also having an impact, even though at least 40 per cent of affected products were already in place before the official launch at the end of 1995. When designing new packs manufacturers should give "due consideration to clear pack differentiation', Mr Linney urged.
<P>
Relationships between wholesalers and manufacturers have recovered from the all time low at the time of the introduction of the Glaxo agency scheme, he said. "The interface has never been better, albeit at the operational level. But there still exists within certain companies the concept that wholesalers are a necessary evil, which reduce manufacturers' profitability by 12.5 per cent only then to give away 7 per cent on average in discount.
<P>
"While the competition aspect was an issue, a degree of reality now exists and the actual competition band above and below  the average discount level is very narrow indeed."
<P>
Mr Linney described the difference between the two figures as a settlement discount. "Remove that from the wholesaler equation by reducing the 12.5 per cent under any future PPRS and the destabilising effect would spread through all sectors," he warned.
<P>
A reduction in cash flow due to removal of the prompt payment incentive for pharmacists would mean a reduction in stockholding and service levels, a de-stocking of slow moving lines and delays in payment to suppliers with resulting loss of settlement discount, predicted Mr Linney.
<P>
The wholesale sector is good value for its 12.5 per cent, he insisted, and most manufacturers have realised that.

<H3><B>Pharmacy pay and conditions failing to meet High Street challenge</B></H3>
<P>
The value of training of staff and the need for incentive and motivation schemes have been  highlighted by pharmaceutical consultant Gerry Green. Mr Green was discussing the preliminary results of a survey into pharmacists' and pharmacy staff's salaries at the spring meeting of the Institute of Pharmacy Management.
<P>
Initial results indicated that employers did not pay pharmacists for any additional activities they undertook, such as continuing education or working with nursing homes. Many employers said these activities were part of the terms and conditions. The survey found a wide range of hourly rates for pay, ranging from less than 10 to over 20, but very few companies had any motivation schemes for pharmacists. 
<P>
This state of affairs was similar for other pharmacy staff. While larger multiples (Lloyds and Boots did not take part in the survey) and supermarkets rewarded staff for extra time and effort, the rest of pharmacy spent very little or nothing on rewarding staff.
<P>
Pharmacists may also face problems in the future if a change of Government brought in a ruling about a minimum wage. Present estimates suggested a minimum wage of 4 an hour was not unlikely, while current NJIC rates were 3.09. The average pay for dispensers was 3.39. Hospital rates for technicians were much higher, starting at 4.75 per hour.
<P>
Wages paid by pharmacy were around 15-20 per cent  below the hourly rate paid by other retailers, even though pharmacists expected more from their staff. Proposed pay offers for 1996 averaged out at 2.25 per cent for managers; no rise for locums; 5 per cent for dispensers and 2.25 per cent for retail staff.
<P>
Mr Green believed that Sir John Harvey-Jones would have a field day if he looked at pharmacy: very few pharmacies involved themselves in work studies and ergonomics, and apart from computer label systems, there had been very little modernisation in pharmacies.

<H3><B>Swiss merger creates new drugs giant</B></H3>
<P>
Swiss pharmaceutical companies Ciba and Sandoz are merging to create Novartis, which will be the second largest pharmaceutical company in the world.
<P>
News of the 50 billion deal sent shares in drug companies soaring as speculation increased regarding the next participants in 'mergermania'. Zeneca, Bayer and Warner Lambert are among the companies yet to participate in industry restructuring.
<P>
Ciba shareholders will receive 45 per cent of the shares in the new company with the rest going to Sandoz: the deal is a merger rather than a takeover, so that in the future Novartis will not be hampered by debt. The company estimates that it will make savings of 1 bn over the next three years.
<P>
However, up to 600 jobs could go in the UK as the company rationalises the merged businesses. Around 1,500 people work for Sandoz and almost 5,000 for Ciba in the UK. Although neither company has given specific details of job losses Novartis aims to cut its workforce by 10 per cent worldwide, meaning 600 jobs could go on a pro rata basis in the UK.
<P>
The merger will catapult Novartis' drug business to second place in the global drug industry, with a market share of 4.4 per cent and sales of around 7.5 billion (including prescription drugs, OTC and vision products).
<P>
Novartis will rank seventh in the self medication market and the company predicts that future growth will be driven by POM to P switches, key product extensions and geographic expansion. Consolidated sales in 1995 stood at 800 million.
<P>
The new company will focus on OTC brands for treating pain, cough, cold, allergy, gastro-intestinal problems, smoking cessation and skin disorders. Key brands include Ex-Lax, Maalox and Otrivin.
<P>
The merger gives the new company good geographic coverage for launching future products and maximising OTC switches such as Nicotinell (for smoking cessation) and Lamisil cream (for fungal infections).
<P>
In pharmaceuticals Novartis will focus on seven therapeutic areas: immunology/inflammatory disease; CNS disorders; cardiovascular; endocrine and metabolic disorders; oncology; dermatology; and asthma. The company's leading products will be Voltaren, Ciba's pain reliever for arthritis, and Sandimmun, Sandoz's anti-rejection drug.
<P>
There are over 94 major products in the company's R&D pipeline and key compounds include Letrozole for breast cancer, Exelon for Alzheimer's Disease and Valsartan for hypertension.
<P>
Novartis will also have a vision care division ranked second in the world, a medical nutrition business and its agrochemical business will also be a world leader.
<P>
Ciba's speciality chemical division and Sandoz's construction chemicals business will be demerged. Dr Alex Krauer, chairman of Ciba, will be chairman of the new company, and Dr Daniel Vasella, chief executive of Sandoz, will become Novartis' president.

<H3><B>Unilever sells Rimmel-Chicogo to German group</B></H3>
<P>
Unilever is selling its cosmetics business Rimmel-Chicogo to the German consumer group Benckiser for an undisclosed sum.
<P>
Rimmel-Chicogo markets mass market colour cosmetics in Europe, including the Rimmel and Sensiq brands. In addition Benckiser will be granted a licence for Cutex brands in Europe. The company will also take over production facilities in Ashford, Kent, and Erkrath, near Dusseldorf in Germany.
<P>
Rimmel-Chicogo brands achieved sales of around 75 million and employs about 800 people, mainly in the UK, Germany and Italy. Benckiser's cosmetics business Coty turned in sales of 950 million in 1995.
<P>
Unilever is current undergoing a major restructuring programme and the sale is part of a move away from cosmetics to concentrate on prestige and mass market toiletries. It also wants to focus on products with global potential, which, it says, Rimmel-Chicogo products do not have.
<P>
Meanwhile Benckiser, which recently failed in its bid to buy the US cosmetics business Maybelline, says that the acquisition will strengthen its number two position in the European colour cosmetics market and will give it the chance to capitalise on synergies with its existing business in areas including R&D.
<P>
Benckiser expects the acquisition to be complete by the end of April.

<H3><B>Asda to buy Moss outlets</B></H3>
<P>
Asda is poised to enter the pharmacy sector with the purchase of a small number of pharmacies from the Unichem-owned Moss chain. The deal was expected to be announced on Thursday as Asda unveiled its annual results.
<P>
Unichem chief executive Jeff Harris confirms that there have been discussions with Asda, ''in terms of transferring some shops''. Moss Chemists and Asda were among the first to develop the supermarket pharmacy concept. Moss currently has 51 pharmacies within Asda stores, although ''there is no question that 51 will be transferred'', says Mr Harris.
<P>
Details of which stores are being sold are not being released until staff have been informed, but it is understood that the numbers involved are ''quite small''. 
<P>
The deal is being driven by Asda, according to Mr Harris, ''although it is not unattractive to us''. It is believed that Asda plans to relocate the pharmacies with-in the shopping area of its stores: currently they are outside the check-outs.
<P>
Asda was refusing to comment this week on whether the company has appointed a pharmacy superintendent. However, <EM>C&D </EM>understands a man has accepted the position.

<H3><B>Society wins sex drug case</B></H3>
<P>
The Royal Pharmaceutical Society has won a test case as part of its campaign to ban the sale of 'poppers' as a recreational drug. But Judge Jarlath Finney at Wood Green Crown Court said on Monday that a gay London  sex shop should not have been prosecuted for illegally selling a sexual performance-enhancing drug.
<P>
Camden's Zipper Store, the only licensed gay and lesbian shop in the country, owned by publishing group Millivres, was fined a nominal 100. The Royal Pharmaceutical Society, which brought the prosecution, is left with a 47,761 legal bill after Judge Finney described the case as a waste of time.
<P>
A Society inspector bought three 10 millilitre bottles of Hi-Tech for 13.50 at the shop in March, 1994. The liquid contained 95 per cent isobutyl nitrate. Millivres pleaded guilty to a summons alleging that the sale of a medicinal product on March 23, 1994, at the Zipper Store, Camden Town, was contrary to section 52 of the Medicines Act, which only allows the sale of medicinal products by a pharmacist or someone under the supervision of a pharmacist at a registered pharmacy.
<P>
Judge Finney added: ''I'm not satisfied it was necessary to prosecute this case. These productions have been sold all over the country for 20 years. I don't think the defendants should pay any of these costs or think they should be paid out of central funds by the taxpayer.''
<P>
The heavy-handed manner of the Society was criticised. Millivres insists it would have withdrawn the product if the Society had informed it that selling it was illegal, but instead was taken to court 20 months after the test purchase. The defence said it was an unfair way to bring about the prosecution.
<P>
Millivres' director and manager, Roy Powell, had faced four similar summonses, but the Society offered no evidence against him after he pleaded not guilty.
<P>
Judge Finney commented: ''Before and after the committal of this case there was a great deal of fumbling by the prosecution, but it was quite an easy case to prepare. Unfortunately, to no small degree, a great deal of irrelevant material was put before the magistrates.''
<P>
The Society's law department head, Steve Lutener, defends its stance. ''It was very much a test case to clear up the law. We could not see any other way of fulfilling our duty.'' He says the judge felt there was no need to bring the case because the defendants pleaded guilty and removed the item from sale, but points out the defendants only changed their plea two weeks before trial.
<P>
''The actual costs of mounting a test case are high and we had to do a lot of work before the defendants pleaded guilty,'' adds Mr Lutener. Now that the legal principle has been established, the next step is to prevent sale through other outlets.

<H3><B>No new hayfever products despite switch</B></H3>
<P>
Pharmacists are unlikely to have a new compound to offer hay-fever sufferers this season, in spite of azelastine becoming a P medicine on July 5. They may also have to wait some time for an OTC version of nizatidine, which completes a POM to P switch on the same date.
<P>
Azelastine hydrochloride becomes P when indicated for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis in adults and children not less than 12 years old. It must be in non-aerosol, aqueous form for nasal administration and must be sold in packs of no more than 36 doses of 140mcg. The pack must be labelled with a maximum dose of 140mcg per nostril and a maximum daily dose of 280mcg per nostril.
<P>
A spokesman for Asta Medica, maker of Rhinolast, told <EM>C&D </EM>there were no plans to launch an OTC pack in the near future and was unable to comment on when one might become available. Nizatidine will be reclassified as a P medicine for the prevention of symptoms of food-related heartburn in people aged 16 and over. The maximum dose will be 75mg, with no more than four doses taken in any 14-day period.
<P>
But Ashbourne Pharmaceuticals said it was not planning to launch an OTC version of Zinga in the near future and Eli Lilly had ''no comment at the moment'' about plans for Axid. The Medicines (Products other than Veterinary Drugs) (Prescription Only) Amendment Order 1996 (SI No 1514; HMSO, 1.10) also exempts Perinal spray from POM control.

<H3><B>Unichem and United Drug in pre-wholesale project</B></H3>
<P>
Unichem and Irish distributor United Drug have launched a joint venture to provide pre-wholesaling distribution services to pharmaceutical and healthcare manufacturers in the UK. A new company, owned equally by the two partners and called Unidrug Distribution Group, will provide order processing, warehousing, logistical and information services to customers. 
<P>
Unichem entered the pre-wholesaling market last year when it won a contract to distribute goods for Smith & Nephew. S&N's contract will remain with Unichem, ''but any new business we write will be under the new venture'', says Unichem's chief executive, Jeff Harris.
<P>
No capital investment will be put into the new company until it wins some business, but three ''biggish'' contracts are understood to be on offer at present.  Winning any one of these will commit the new venture to spending around 4 million on plant and equipment. A new stand-alone distribution centre is planned along the M1 motorway corridor near junction 28.
<P>
United Drug is Ireland's largest pharmaceutical distributor, with wholesale and distribution interests in Northern Ireland. Turnover last year approached IR250m. Pre-wholesaling is much bigger business in Ireland than the UK. United Drug has been active in the area for over 20 years, and now represents over 40 manufacturers. Clients include Astra, Eli Lilly, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Zeneca. Mr Harris hopes some of the contracts the new company wins will be for the UK and Ireland, in which case United Drug's depot in Dublin will be used.
<P>
He says the emerging pre-wholesale market represents a major opportunity for Unichem. ''UDG is operational with immediate effect and we shall be actively marketing its services over the coming months.'' Manufacturers are recognising the advantages in having others deal with their distribution to the wholesale and hospital sectors, allowing them to concentrate on core manufacturing businesses, it is claimed.

The Government has published new guidance to planning authorities aimed at revitalising town centres. The revised Planning Policy Guidance for Town Centres and Retail Development (PPG6) further reinforces the Government's U-turn on out of town developments. 
<P>
Local planners should ''seek to retain post offices and pharmacies in existing districts and local centres, and in village shops, and discourage their inclusion in out of centre retail developments'', according to Paragraph 3.19 of the guidance. ''Towns are where most of the  population live, work and shop, and where many of the 4.4 million households projected for 1991 to 2016 will need to go. It is where we should be encouraging location of shops, offices, leisure and housing,'' environment secretary John Gummer told the Commons.
<P>
Local authorities are encouraged to adopt a 'sequential approach' to choosing sites for new developments, eliminating town centres before looking at edge of centre, and only then other sites which are well served by a choice of means of transport. The Community Pharmacy Action Group has welcomed the Government's announcement.
<P>
 ''For too long a free-for-all was allowed which has caused irreparable damage to our High Streets and shopping parades,'' says CPAG member Tim Astill. However, he warns it will all be just empty words if the Government stands by and allows Resale Price Maintenance to be abandoned.

<H3><B>RPSGB boots Asda ads off tv</B></H3>
<P>
Supermarket chain Asda has been forced to withdraw a television advertising campaign for its new range of own-label, cut-price medicines after complaints from two industry bodies were upheld by the Independent Television Commission.
<P>
The adverts used celebrity Jan Leeming to promote the range and make comparisons with branded OTC medicines. The ITC's code of practice forbids the use of testimonials from personalities to promote medicines.
<P>
The Royal Pharmaceutical Society wrote to the ITC last Wednesday pointing out that the adverts contravene the Medicines (Advertising) Regulations 1994 (SI 1994 no 1932). The ITC ban came into effect from June 21. The commercials, which were due to finish on June 23, were replaced by rolling text explaining Asda's position. 
<P>
A second complaint has since been made by the RPSGB regarding the replacement advert. The Society alleges it is also in breach of the Regulations, which state that adverts must include a clear instruction to read the label. Separately, the Society's secretary and registrar, John Ferguson, has written to the British Medical Journal in response to a letter from Asda chief executive Archie Norman circulated to doctors.
<P>
Mr Norman is asking doctors who would like to support his campaign to end Resale Price Maintenance on medicines to return a reply-paid card. Mr Ferguson argues that branded, non-prescription medicines are 20-30 per cent less expensive than in every other European Union country except Sweden, and that the dispute is not just about price. ''It is about the way that medicines should be regarded and offered for sale,'' he says. 
<P>
Mr Norman says that the ''artificial price fixing that RPM allows'' is not the way to support neighbourhood chemists. He describes it as an ''indirect tax of 300 million a year ... 80 per cent of which finds its way into the profits of multinational drug companies and national retail chains''.

<LI>The National Pharmaceutical Association has reacted angrily to Asda's claims that excess profits are being made on OTC medicines. Director Tim Astill says that the average pharmacy only makes 50p on every 1.50 spent by the consumer on OTC medicines. As well as the overheads, pharmacies have to employ a pharmacist; they are required to train counter staff; and they even refuse around 17 per cent of potential sales, Mr Astill says.

<H3><B>OTC training for GPs is a success</B></H3>
<P>
The Proprietary Association of Great Britain's strategic plan to develop the OTC medicines industry is now four years old, ''and we are beginning to see progress'', president Dr Alan Raymond told members at last week's annual meeting 
<P>
The OTC training programme launched by the Proprietary Association of Great Britain in April this year for GPs, using pharmacists as tutors, has already been taken up by 29 health authorities. This and other initiatives are changing the way doctors view OTC medicines, according to Dr Raymond. ''If we are going to empower the consumer to self-medicate, a key driver is the GP.''
<P>
Doctors are beginning to appreciate that OTCs can save them time and their patients money. The average cost of an OTC medicine is 2.03, compared to the 5.50 script charge. The change in consumer habits is being encouraged by Government, using the same marketing methods as industry. 
<P>
The Health Education Authority has used television advertising to push the folic acid message. A Department of Health commercial in Northern Ireland used the catchline: ''Why do they always expect prescriptions for minor illnesses? Talk to your doctor or pharmacist.''
<P>
The advert had a 55 per cent recall among viewers (71 per cent when prompted), and 60 per cent of viewers understood the message it was putting across. ''Doctors no longer regard OTCs as second class medicine but as a valid optional treatment choice. Consumers have always viewed OTC as first-line therapy and pharmacists need them, professionally and commercially,'' said Dr Raymond.
<P>
Drivers in the OTC market pre-1992 were few. In 1993, all that changed with the fast-track POM to P process. Coincidentally, it was the year that consolidation within the pharmaceutical industry started in a big way. Every major prescription drug company now has an OTC partner. Since 1993, there has been $104 billion invested in taking Rx products OTC, said Dr Raymond. 
<P>
Consolidation has seen ten companies taking 58 per cent of the UK OTC market. ''There is now investment in the market to an extent that has not been seen for many years,'' commented Dr Raymond. The Government has been a partner for change in the OTC market. 
<P>
The UK now offers one of the most favourable regulatory climates to operate worldwide, he believed. The 'Health of the Nation' initiative has provided a framework for better health, while the NHS reorganisation has empowered doctors locally.
<P>
''It is very encouraging to see the way the pharmacy profession has seized the initiative, and has clearly identified the importance of its role in self-medication,'' said Dr Raymond.
<P>
Fundamental to expanding the OTC market and driving volume growth has been the ability to extend the indications for which products could be supplied OTC.
