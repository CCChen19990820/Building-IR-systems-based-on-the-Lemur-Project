<title>Lugar Plan To Replace the Income Tax With a National Sales Tax</title>

<h3>Lugar Plan To Replace the Income Tax With A National Sales Tax</h3>
</center>
<br>
<br>
This proposal is aimed at addressing the basic problems afflicting the U.S. economy, as well as liberating Americans from the intrusive burden of the income tax.<p>
We cannot raise wages, create new jobs, or eliminate our national debt if the American economydoes not grow.  Nothing short of sustained economic growth will solve these problems and create opportunity for all Americans.<p>
Economists agree on a few things, but the vast majority agree that we will not grow if we do not save more and invest more.  Tinkering wiht the income tax system is not the answer.  Last year's reforms are reversed the following year.  This year's complexity is made more complex next year.  All the while, no significant improvement is achieved in the U.S. savings rate, and Americans struggle on with a needlessly complex and intrusive tax system.<p>
<br>
<br>
<h4>OUTLINE OF THE LUGAR PLAN</h4>
<br>
<br>
A National Sales Tax (NST) on goods and services would replace the federal personal and corporate income taxes.  The capital gains tax and the estate tax would be eliminated as well.<p>
Economists who have studied the national sales tax estimate that the NST rate of about 17% would replace the revenue generated by our current tax system.  The rate would be somewhat higher or lower depending on exemptions, although exemptions should be minimized.<p>
The federal government should work with the states to collect the national sales tax.  The federal government should ensure that it is done without extra cost to the states.  Most states already have sales tax collection systems in place.<p>
Social Security taxes and payment benefits would not be affected by this proposal, except that no
social security benefits would be taxed.<p>
The IRS would be eliminated.  A vastly smaller office or agency would be required to administer the national slaes tax and the FICA tax.  For most Americans, tax record keeping, audits, and filing of forms would be things of the past.<p>
Legislation to implement a national sales tax would have to reflect choices on a number of issues, including the methods used to prevent regressivity.  Any system of taxation requires such decisions.  Like the income tax, a national sales tax can be designed so that it is not regressive.<p>
As increased savings and investment fuels more economic growth, the sales tax should be lowered.<p>
<br>
<br>
<h3>Advantages of the National Sales Tax</h3>
An NST will leave more money in American paychecks.  Because the government would no longer withold income taxes from paychecks, citizens would decide how much of their total income to save and how much to subject to taxation through purchases. <p> 
The NST would be a powerful incentive for savings in America.  Currently the United States has one of the lowest savings rates of any industiralized country.  According to a study by economist Laurence Kotlikoff, an NST would increase the savings rate from roughly 2% to about 7.6% in the first year.  Increasing the U.S. savings rate is a key to achieving strong economic growth, lower interests rates, improvements in real wages, and the expansion of revenue necessary to balance the budget.<p>
The national sales tax would allow for the dismantling of the current IRS and the intrusive, inefficient and costly enforcement of the current tax code.  Estimates of uncollected income tax range as hight as $150 billion per year.<p>
Businesses and individuals devote billions of man hours each year to comply with the tax code.  Under an NST, that time could be spent more productively on other activities.<p>
The simplicity of the NST and the absence of the IRS would have the effect of discouraging frequent tinkering with the tax code which complicates business activities, leads to loopholes for special interests, abd creates uncertainties for many Americans.  Thirty-one tax reforms have been enacted in the last 41 years.<p>
The NST, unlike the income tax or a value added tax (VAT), is transparent.  Individuals will know what they are paying to the government in taxes.  A transparent tax would contribute greatly to achieving the national political will to curb spending and balance the budget.<p>
Most states already have mechanisms in place to enforce a sales tax, and most taxpayers already understand how sales taxes work.  Therefore the establishment of a national sales tax could be achieved with a minimum of expense and confusion.<p>
American exports would no longer be put at a competitive disadvantage by the income tax.  Under our current system, the costs of corporate income taxes are built into the price of goods.  This raises the price of exports and make them less competitive overseas.  The NST would helpus export, thereby reducing the trade deficit and creating more jobs.  Economists estimate that for every additional $1 billion in exports, 20,000 jobs are created.  Imports, on the other hand, would be taxed at the time of sale, like all other goods.<p>
Under the NST, drug dealers and other criminals who currently escape or evade the income tax would pay the national sales tax like any other consumer.<p>
Because companies will not have to add the costs of the income tax to their products, the underlying price of most goods and services will be lower under and NST.<p>
An NST would end intrusive enforcement of the tax coe , which harms personal privacy.  It also would eliminate the ambiguity of the income tax, which causes many conscientious Americans to live in anxiety over the possibility of mistakes that could lead to penalties or charges.<p>
Although a flat tax would be a step in the right direction, an NST is preferable because the flat tax would retain many of the complexities of the current income tax system.  The IRS income tax collection aparatus would continue to exist.  Furthermore, the flat tax retains the corporate tax and the complexities involved in its calculation.  Also tinkering with the flat tax would be a constant temptation.  Many would seek to amend the tax code to promote special interests or social agendas.  The history of revisions to the 1986 Tax Reform Act demonstrates that the government  will always be tempted to ament the income tax code.<p>

<h3>Testimony by Senator Richard Lugar<br>
In Front of the House Ways and Means Committee<br>
 June 8, 1995</h3>
</center>
<br>
<br>
<p>
Mister Chairman, I thank you for your strong leadership in the area of tax reform.  Your oft quoted comment that our current tax system should be "pulled out by the roots" has been an inspiration as I have traveled the country advocating the elimination of the federal income tax.<p>
What I have found during my travels is that American families are frustrated, and even angry, with their economic predicament.  They feel like they are running on a treadmill and that treadmill is winning 
The problem is that rnany Americans suspect there is diminishing hope for a better future. 
The economic facts justify these beliefs.  From 1950 through 1973, hourly compensation including both wages and benefits increased an average of 3.0 percent per year.  Since 1973, the average wage mcrease has been less than one half of one percent.  During the past two decades, economic growth has been cut in half averaging only 2.4 percent annually. And if this isn't depressing enough for the average American family, limiting growth to 2.5 percent is the stated economic policy of the Federal Reserve Board.<p>
This we must chance. The American public is demanding it.<p>
The cause of America's economic doldrums is twofold: the huge federal budget deficit that robs us of the capital we need to grow, and a federal tax stystem that not only discourages, but confiscates our savings and investment.<p>
Our net national savings rate has reached alarmingly low levels. After averaging close to 9.0 percent in the 1960's, we recemty saw our nation's savings rate bottom out at 1.1 percent in 1992.  Because of this low rate of savings, capital to fuel our economy has become increasingly scarce. As a result, our annual productivity gain has averaged just 1.1 percent from 1974 to 1994. The Concord Coaltion estimates that had our productivity held its pre 1974 annual rate of 2.9 percent, the median family income would now be $5O,000 a year instead of the current level of  S35,000 a year.<p>
Americans celebrate that both houses of Congress have now passed budget resolutions that will bring us to balance in seven years. We now face the more difficult task of actually implementing this budget guide m our spending measures. We must be resolute m this endeavor and not fall victim to buiness as usual in Washington.<p>
As part of the effort to balance the budget, I support providing the American public with tax relief But I strongly believe it is time to stop working around the edges of the tax code We must transform It completely.<p>
The federal income tax system is inherently flawed. By taxing savings and investment at least twice, it has become the biggest impediment to economic growth in tbe country. It represents the worst form of big govemment intrusion into the lives of all Americans. Each year it costs Americans morr than 5 billion hours of time to comply with it. That is equal to the tolal worker output of my state of Indiana.  It is unfair.  It is riddled with loopholes. It has been changed 31 times in the past 41 years. And finally, it doesn't work.<p>
By its own admission, the Internal Revenue Service fails to collect from nearly 10 million taxpayers, worth an estimated $127 billion in uncollected taxes annually.<p>
Anything this bad, this broken and this ineffective should be ended decisively, and that is what I propose. I want to scrap the income tax completely and replace it with a national sales tax.<p>
Mr. Chairman, you have outlined the criteria for evaluating an effective tax system. It must be: (1) simple, (2) the least intrusive (3) fair, (4) border adustable, and (5) friendly to savings and investment.  I have added that it also must be transparent.  I have studied all the recent tax proposals with these six factors in mind.  Many are better than the current tax systesm.  But f we are going to overhaul our tax system we should choose the one that meets these criteria.  I have concluded that a national sales tax is the best alternative.<p>
The first factor in choosing an effective tax system is its simplicity.  Under a national sales tax, tbe burden of complying with the income tax would be lifted.  There would be no records to keep or audits to fear.  The money a person makes is his or her own. You don't have to report it. You don't have to hide it. You may decide if you want to save it, mvest it, or give it to your children. It is only when you buy something that you pay a tax.  Although I applaud the efforts of  flat tax advocates to simplify tax forms, nothing could be more simple than no forms at all.<p>
The national sales tax is tbe least intrusive of the tax proposals. The IRS would be substantially dismantled under ny proposal.  The IRS would no longer look over the shoulders of every American.  There wil be no audits. Americans would not waste time and effort worrymg about record keeping, deductions or exemptions that are part of the current tax code. Although the flat tax proposals tax consumption, they do so by giving the income tax a facelift and leaving the IRS largely intact You have stated, Mr. Chairman, "If the roots remain, the tree will grow back"<p>
The national sales tax is the fairest. Everyone pays the tax including wealthy individuals, criminals illegal aliens, and others who currently avoid taxation.  Wealthy Americans who consume more would pay higher taxes under the national sales tax.  Individual who save and invest their money will pay less.  Gone are the loopholes and the deductions.<p>
The national sales tax would also tax the underground economy. When criminals and illegal aliens consume the proceeds of their activities, they will pay a tax. Foreign tourists will pay the tax.  Tax systems that rely on reporting will never collect any of this revenue.<p>
Of course, the fairness test must likewise consider those with limited means to pay taxes. An integral part of my plan is protection for Amencans who need it -- senior citzens, the unemployed, and Americans with low paying jobs.<p>
One strategy for addressing this problem would exempt a threshold level of goods and services
consumed from each American from the national slaes tax.  Each citizen who has a social security number will receive this exemption.  For example, if the exemption level were $5000, a family of four would have its first $20,0000 exempt from the sales tax.  This figure is approximately 33 percent above the 1994 poverty threshold for a family of four.<p>
Another strategy might be the exempting of items such as housing and medicine.  This is the method the majority of states have chosen and the one advocated by this committee's chairman.  Americans understand and are comfortable with this practice.  In the end it will be up to this committee and the Finance Committee in the Senate to decide the desirable path.<p>
The national sales tax is the most transparent of the tax reform proposals. A federal tax that is evident to everyone would bolster effiorts in Congress to achieve prudence m federal spending. There should be no hidden corporate taxes that are passed on to consumers or with holding mechanisms that mask the amount we pay in taxes.  Every year the public and Congress should openly debate the tax rate necessary for federal government to meet its obligations.  If average Americans are paying that rate everyday, they will make sure that Congress spends public funds wisely.<p>
American exports would also benefit from the enactment of a national sales tax.  In January, the United States registered one of tbe largest trade deficits in our nation's history. We must adopt a tax system that encourages exports. Most of our trading partners have tax systems that are border adjustable.  They are able to strip out their tax when they are exporting goods. In comparison the  income tax, and for that matter the flat tax, are not border adjustable.   American goods that are sent overseas are taxed twice -- once by the income tax and once when they reach their destination.  In comparison, the national sales tax would not be levied on exports.  It would level the playing field with our trading patners.  And best of all foreign imports would be taxed when they are consumed in the United States.<p>
Mr. Chairman, the last and most imperitive reason for replacing tbe income tax with a national sales tax is that it would liberate our economy by encouraging savings. For the first time in the modern era, the next generation of Americans may be worse off than the previous one.  Despite robust economic growth over the past several years, the average income of families has fallen.  They feel trapped in a box with diminishing hop of escaping.<p>
The bottom line is that as a nation, we do not save enough.  Savings are vital because they are
the source of all investment and productivity gains  -- savings supply the capital for buying anew machine, developing a new product or service, or employing an extra worker.  According to a recent poll, seventy two percent of Americans realize that they are not saving enough for the future.  Our net national savings rate in the 1990's has been 1.8 percent of GDP compared with a rate of 8.1 percent in the 1960's, 7.2 percent in the 1970's, and 3.7 in the 1980's.<p>
The Japanese save at a rate nine times greater than Americans greater than Americans and the Germans save five times as much as we do.  Today, many believe that Americans inherently consume beyond their means and cannot save enough for the future.  Few realize that before WWII, before the income tax reached its present form, Americans saved a larger portion of their earnings than the Japanese.<p>
A national sales tax would reeverse this trend by directly taxing consuption and leaving savings and investment untaxed.  Economists agree that a broad based consumption tax would increase our savings rate substantially.  Economist Laurence Kottlikoff of Boston University estimates that our savings rate would more than triple in the first year.  The implementation of a national sales tax is expected to create one million new jobs over a ten year period and a three percent rise in wages over that same period of time.  Economist Dale Jorgenson of Harvard Universityhas concluded that had a consumption tax like the national sales tax been put into place in 1986 instead of the current system, The U.S. would have experienced one trillion dollars in additional economic rowth.  Mr. Chairman, our citizens and our economy cannot afford to wait any longer.<p>
As I have outlined here today, I believe the national sales tax is the best tax system to replace the income tax.  It is simple.  It protects privacy.  It is fair and transparent.  And it promotes economically beneficial behavior.  For these reasons, I encourage it enactment.<p>

When July comes to mind one conjures up visions of backyard barbecues, sipping iced-tea on the
front porch, long weekends at the beach, or  Independence Day.  Summer is often thought of as a
less strenuous time, a time when "every night is a Saturday night," a time when Americans can
relax and escape from the burdens of everyday life.  Americans work all year so that in the
summer they may enjoy the fruits of their labor.  However, the reality is that this year the average
American had to work past Independence Day to pay their taxes.  Thus, from New years Eve to
July ninth Americans are working for the government -- that is 190 days out of the year.<p> 

There is little disagreement that our current tax system, in which the average American sends
40% of what they earn to the government, is severely flawed and must change. In describing our
current tax system, Grover G. Norquist, President of Americans For Tax Reform wrote that our
current system, "...favors consumption over investment, short term over long term horizons, debt
over equity, and service over manufacturing industry.."  Mr. Norquist continues by pronouncing
that: "The current tax code is a crazy hodge-podge of conflicting features for a single reason:
Once politicians get hold of a tax, they just can't let go.  As a result, minor fixes that could make
the current tax code much less a barrier to long-term growth just don't get made."  The numbers
back-up Mr. Norquist's claims.  A report on the IRS shows that over the past 10 years some 2000
tax code provisions have been released and the agency has doubled in size.<p> 

 Fortunately, the November elections have brought the tax debate to the forefront of political
discourse for the first time in thirty years.  Today, most politicians agree that the tax code is very
much in need of reform.  However, there is enormous disagreement on how this change should
be orchestrated.  Whether a conservative Republican or liberal Democrat, chances are you have a
plan to reform the tax code.<p>

From House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt who has attempted to bring the Democrats into
the great tax debate with his 10% progressive tax plan to House majority leader Dick Armey who
has spearheaded the tax debate by giving life to what has been dubbed the "Flat Tax," the
leadership of  both parties in the House are responding to the cries of the American people who
are demanding a fairer tax code.  Presidential hopeful Richard Lugar has also joined the debate,
coming out in support of House Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer's National Sales Tax
proposal.  Whatever the plan may be one thing Washington can certainly agree on, whether for
philosophical or political reasons, is that Americans are demanding a new tax code, one that
allows them to work most of the year for themselves and their families.<p>  

Here are three of the most talked about plans.  Judge for yourself, the merits, (or lack- there-of)
for each, and then go to the Cyber Personality Forum to let people know what you think.  We
promise it won't be too "taxing."<p>

<P>
People who do paid work from home so that they can care for their
children are presently in most cases denied any meaningful deduction
for their legitimate home-office expenses under the Internal Revenue
Code. Not only is this result inequitable for these taxpayers,
but it also puts them at a competitive disadvantage with their
colleagues who rent or own workspace away from home. Furthermore,
it discourages people who want to spend more time with their children
from establishing home-based businesses or from making a home-based
work arrangement with their employer.
<P>
Taxpayers who conduct a home business while caring for dependents,
particularly small children, often fail to qualify for the home-office
deduction under Section 280A of the Code, because it requires
that the space used for a home business to be used exclusively
for such purpose. The home-based businesswoman needing to keep
an eye on small children or struggling with one income needs to
be physically proximate to her children and may not be able to
afford a separate room or space used for no other purpose. In
either instance, no deduction is allowed for depreciation, rent
(if the taxpayer doesn't own his or her home), maintenance, utilities
and insurance expenses allocable to the home office space if,
for instance, the work room is used also as a family room or guest
bedroom.
<P>
In another related development, the IRS has taken the position
that day care providers (presently, the only home-based businesses
that are not required to satisfy the &quot;exclusive use&quot;
rule) must keep elaborate records on the time any room is used
for personal and business purposes. This recordkeeping requirement
would presumably apply to any future exceptions to the &quot;exclusive
use&quot; rule such as taxpayers who operate home businesses while
caring for dependents. It imposes an unworkable burden on the
home-based business not required of their non home-based competitors.
<P>
Moreover, the value of a new exception to the &quot;exclusive
use&quot; rule would be minimal unless the existing rule for allocating
time of use was amended.  Applying the existing allocation rule to a home-based business
where there is mixed use of space, even if the business were operating a full
40 hours per week, results in a deduction worth only 25 percent
of the amount a competitor in an office receives for the same
expenses.
<P>
Finally, employees who are &quot;telecommuters&quot; and who would
otherwise qualify for the deduction for home-office expenses under Section 280A's
&quot;exclusive use&quot; test, are often denied the deduction under Section 67
enacted in 1986. Section 67 disallows home-office expenses of
an employee to the extent that such expenses along with other
certain &quot;miscellaneous itemized deductions&quot; do not,
in the aggregate, exceed two percent of the taxpayer's adjusted
gross income. Such other deductions are defined sufficiently broadly
that it would be the rare case where the two percent floor was
exceeded, and then, only the excess of expenses above the floor
is deductible.
<P>
<B>Suggested Solutions</B>:
<P>
Consequently, in order to provide the growing number of home-based
employees and business owners proper tax treatment that recognizes
legitimate business expenses in a way that is comparable to their
competitors and colleagues who are not home-based, the following
amendments to the Internal Revenue Code are needed:
<UL>
(1) Amend Section 280A(c)(1) to allow an exception to the &quot;exclusive
use&quot; rule permitting mixed use of space for business and
personal purposes in the case of taxpayers who conduct home-based
businesses while caring for dependents. Dependents should be defined
to include not only children, but also elderly parents or a sick
spouse.
<P>
(2) Amend Section 280A(c)(4)(C) to revise the allocation rule
for mixed uses to only compare only the amount of time a room
is in fact used for a business or personal purpose and not count
the time a room is used for no purpose at all (e.g., nighttime).
This would eliminate the reduction in the deductions for business
use for the time the mixed use room is used for no purpose and
put home-based taxpayers on a par with non-home-based taxpayers
who do not suffer a loss in deductions for their office space
when the office is closed.
<P>
(3) Provide some statutory &quot;safe harbors&quot; in Section
280A(c)(4) on calculating the mixed use of space for home day
care providers and, if the amendment suggested in (1) above is
enacted, for taxpayers with home-based businesses caring for dependents
to eliminate, in most cases, a burdensome recordkeeping requirement.
<P>
(4) Amend Section 67 to exclude home-office expenses of employees
from the miscellaneous itemized deductions subject to the two
percent floor.

<h2>Income Tax vs. Sales Tax</h2>
<P>
By Grover G. Norquist
</center>
<P>
<p>
<p>
 The political class is approaching a consensus long held by the
American people: The federal income tax system is economically
destructive, overly intrusive, unfair and far too complicated.
<P>
 Historians will marvel at how quickly Members of Congress shifted
from Bill Clinton's view, as expressed in his $200 billion dollar
tax hike in the summer of 1993, that the only problem with the
income tax was that it did not tax successful wealth creation
at high enough rates.  We now confront the present debate between
moving to a flat rate "consumed income tax" or scrapping
the income tax completely and replacing it with a national sales
tax.
<P>
 Dick Armey, the House Majority Leader and a former economics
professor, has been the leading proponent of moving to a flat
tax that would tax all income once at a flat rate of 17 percent
after a personal exemption for a married couple of $23,000 and
of $36,000 for a family of four.  Should an American save and
invest any portion of his income during the year that money saved
would be exempt from tax. In effect, every American would have
an Individual Retirement Account with no limit on how much one
can save, no requirement that the money stay in the IRA until
retirement and no tax upon withdrawal. In effect this creates
a super turbo- charged Individual Retirement Account.
<P>
 Congressman Bill Archer and Senator Dick Lugar have proposed
replacing the present income tax with a consumption tax or a national
retail sales tax respectively.
<P>
 Michael Rothschild has criticized Mr. Armey and all advocates
of the flat tax for missing what he sees as a golden political
opportunity and advocating reforming the present system rather
than uprooting the IRS and moving to a national sales tax.
<P>
 Rothschild is correct in his criticisms of the present income
tax system, although he could have gone further.   But is he correct
that the sales tax would be a long-term improvement over Armey's
flat tax?  For political as well as economic reasons the answer
is no.
<P>
 The great strength of the flat tax is that it treats all American
citizens equally. This is a central tenet of American civilization.
Dividing citizens by income class is a European affliction that
Americans have rejected in most areas of civic life.  We are outraged
by the implication that a persons income would affect his standing
in court. We would not permit wealth or income to determine whether
one could vote, serve on a jury, attend public school, or engage
in freedom of speech and religion.
<P>
 The demagogic politicians who would exploit class divisions in
America are of a cloth with those who would divide Americans by
race for their own political gain.  It is not by accident that
the move towards a flat tax comes at the same time as the nation
is rejecting affirmative action, quotas and racial preferences
of all kinds.  We are Americans and we cannot allow the politicians
to continue to divide us against each other.
<P>
 For this same reason the flat tax is difficult to increase. 
In 1993, Bill Clinton told Americans to pay no attention to  his
1993 tax-and-spend budget increase as only "the rich"
would pay more.  Then, when the tax hike on "the rich"
was locked in, he moved to then tax only "social security
recipients" and only "small businesses that file as
subchapter S corporations" and then "only" those
who buy gasoline for their cars.  In Massachusetts the pro spending
interests --government workers unions -- have tried five times
through the initiative and referendum process to change the state's
present constitutional requirement for a flat tax to allow graduated
rates. Five times voters have publicly rejected this "populist"
measure despite assurances that "only the rich" would
be targeted. Voters recognized that once income groups were divided
they would be attacked one by one and divided against each other
until they fell.
<P>
 It is important to Americans that they have the same relationship
to the state as all other Americans. Equality before the law is
central to American life. It is also the best protection against
attempts to raise taxes.  An increase in a flat tax is opposed
by all taxpayers. A cut in a flat tax benefits all taxpayers.
 What a change that would make in the dynamics of the politics
of taxes.
<P>
 Mr. Rothschild overstates the virtues and understates the sad
history of national sales taxes in other nations.  First, sales
taxes are shot full of loopholes and gradations around the world
and in the 50 states.  Every year lobbyists swarm state capitols
asking that their product be exempt from sales taxes as a necessity.
California just went through the debate about the snack tax, which
included defining what a snack is.
<P>
 But a sales tax to replace the income tax -- and the social security
tax and inheritance tax and gift taxes if we are to be rid of
the Internal revenue service that enforces all these taxes --
is not a real option.  As economist Bruce Bartlett has calculated,
any sales tax would have to be 13.3 percent  to replace the income
tax, another 13.6 percent to replace the social security tax,
and another 3.3 percent to replace the corporate income tax. A
sales tax this high would be forced to be collected as a Value
Added Tax or VAT at every level of production.  No one would buy
retail. As in every European nation the sales tax would almost
immediately become a Value Added Tax which taxes goods and services
at every level of production. VAT's like income taxes are very,
very intrusive in the lives of businessmen and women, just like
the hated income tax.
<P>
 Worse, advocating a sales tax to replace the income tax could
well lead to the imposition of a sales tax/VAT in addition to
the present income taxes.  Every nation in Europe that has a VAT
also has a personal income tax and a corporate income tax as well
as wage taxes like social security.
<P>
 Americans of good will should work together to support the present
strategy of the House Republican leadership; to match spending
reduction with tax cuts that move us toward a flat tax.  The tax
cuts passed by the House include moving toward eliminating all
taxes on savings and investment and toward a larger personal and
dependent exemption.  Tax cuts alongside spending reductions makes
it clear that the purpose of reducing federal spending is not
simply to get Washington's sorry budget in order, but to protect
the American family's budget which has the first claim to money
it earns.
<P>
 And while it is important to move to a flat tax  on consumed
income to simplify the code, reduce the destruction American savings
and investment and treat all citizens equally -- without risking
burdening the people with an additional sales tax -- the true
challenge for Americans is to reduce the total size, scope and
power of the central government. Ultimately there is no nice,
pleasant, non destructive way to wrest 20 to 25 percent of the
total economy away from those who create wealth and distribute
it to the political class.  The total tax burden must be reduced
while we work to minimize the costs of the tax system upon our
freedoms, our families and our civil society. 
<P>
<p>
Grover G. Norquist is president of Americans for Tax Reform.

<h3>COMMENTS ON DEPLOYMENT OF 25,000 U.S. FORCES<br> 

IN BOSNIA HERZEGOVINA</h3> 
<P>
<B>TESTIMONY OF JEANE J. KIRKPATRICK</B> 
<P>
<B>before</B> 
<P>
<B>THE NATIONAL SECURITY COMMITTEE</B><br> 
<B>UNITED STATES HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES</B> 
<P><i>NOVEMBER 15, 1995</i> </center>
<P><hr><P>
<B>Introduction</B> 
<P>
I thank the Committee on National Security for inviting me to
testify today on this important subject. I will try to restrict
my remarks to subjects directly relevant to the Committee's concerns.
<P>
I welcome the Committee's hearings on U.S. troop deployment. Obviously
it is difficult no, impossible for the Committee or its witnesses
to decide whether it will be necessary or desirable to support
and to implement an agreement which does not exist, whose terms
are unknown, and about which there remain large differences among
the parties.
<P>
We do not know whether defensible borders will be drawn for Bosnia
Herzegovina, whether the arms embargo will be lifted and a Bosnian
army trained to defend its country from well-armed neighbors.
We do not know who else will be participating in a multinational
peace force, nor how they will be integrated and commanded, nor
under what rules of engagement they will operate, nor what kind
of exit strategy is planned.
<P>
It is impossible, therefore to decide now that the United States
should or should not participate in a hypothetical force to defend
a hypothetical agreement, but it is possible to address questions
relevant to the deployment.
<P>
<B>II. United States National Interests in Bosnia</B> 
<P>
The Committee asks: Are there important national interests at
stake in Bosnia? My answer to this question is yes, Americans
have many important interests in this conflict.
<P>
I have believed from the onset of the war in former Yugoslavia
that important moral, political and strategic interests are at
stake in the Balkans. Recall that two world wars have spread from
the Balkan tinder box wars which engulfed the European continent
and eventually involved the United States as well. Because we
are a part of the Western world, we cannot be indifferent to brutal
aggression and mass murder in the heart of Europe.
<P>
More than two and one half million Bosnians have been displaced
from their homes in this war, more than 200,000 killed. Concentration
camps, torture, mass rape and mass murder have become familiar
again in the region. The methods used against the people of Bosnia
slaughter, starvation, forced population transfers and other instruments
of &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; dehumanize the victims. Indifference
to these dehumanizes us.
<P>
The Committee requests a description of the &quot;precise connection&quot;
between stability in Bosnia, the Balkan peninsula and the balance
of power in Europe. But &quot;precise connections&quot; are known
only after events have developed. Often they come as a surprise.
<P>
But we know violence is contagious. And that conquest is contagious
as well. Former Yugoslavia is centrally, strategically located.
Location is not everything in international affairs, but the centrality
and ethnic-diversification of former Yugoslavia give developments
there greater geostrategic significance than if those countries
were more isolated or remote. Moreover, the countries of Central
Europe recently released from the Soviet Empire have new regimes
and new borders which leave them more susceptible to destabilization
than established regimes.
<P>
In the current conflict, violence sponsored by the Serbian government
has already spread from Kosovo to Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia Herzegovina.
It has already extended across Macedonia's borders. We cannot
know where it might end if permitted to continue. Russia, too,
has a stake in the region, and Ukraine, Hungary, Bulgaria, Albania,
Greece, Turkey, Italy.
<P>
We should not forget that Benito Mussolini and his Black Shirts
inspired Adolf Hitler and others, nor that Mussolini's aggression
against Ethiopia presented the League of Nations and its members
a challenge they could not meet and the League collapsed, that
Hitler was encouraged by the Italian's success to consolidate
his own powers, and that Hitler's success in occupying the Rhineland
encouraged him to move again into Austria, Czechoslovakia and
beyond, to the ovens of Auschwitz and the graveyards of Normandy.
<P>
Through it all, our European Allies watched, never dreaming that
Hitler's appetite would extend so far or with such consequences.
They had vital interests and no prescience. Much the same combination
has guided the European response to Serb expansion.
<P>
The harm done by violent tyrants in this century always comes
as a surprise.
<P>
The United States and the whole of democratic Europe have a large
stake in ensuring that extreme nationalism, instability, xenophobia
and Serb conquests do not whet the savage appetites of would-be
tyrants and conquerors in the Balkans and among their neighbors.
<P>
<B>III. The Proposed Deployment: Is it Necessary?</B> 
<P>
To say the United States has an interest in ending violence and
conquest in Bosnia and an interest in promoting and preserving
stability and democracy in the region is not to say we must send
25,000 U.S. troops to take part in a 60,000 man peace operation
much less that such an operation would succeed.
<P>
No new style peacekeeping operation undertaken by the United Nations
and the Clinton Administration in an area of conflict has secured
peace. U.N. peace operations conducted in Somalia and Bosnia over
the last three years have achieved virtually none of their goals
although Phase I of the Somalia operation, undertaken by President
George Bush, succeeded in delivering large quantities of food
to prevent mass starvation in Somalia.
<P>
These &quot;peace operations&quot; have suffered from disorganization
and disagreement among participants, lack of coordination and
political will, military incompetence and ineffectiveness. Some
of their shortcomings were a consequence of the United Nation's
lack of skill and experience. Some were a consequence of the diverse
interests, priorities, goals and perspectives of participants
which are common to multilateral operations.
<P>
But it is not clear that a multinational operation involving many
governments, languages and organizational habits can succeed in
coping with difficult military problems. Clearly, however, an
operation under NATO command has a better chance of success than
one under U.N. command. That is what is now proposed.
<P>
A) Does American credibility requires 25,000 U.S. troops on the
ground?
<P>
U.S. credibility is at stake only if the Clinton Administration
made commitments to supply such a force without consultation or
consent of the Congress. But America's allies understand that
the Congress plays an important constitutional role in U.S. foreign
policy. Failure to provide ground troops might do superficial
damage to America's credibility, but committing troops and failing
to achieve our goal would constitute a devastating blow to the
credibility of the U.S. government at home and abroad. <I>The
worst outcome would be an effort that first committed U.S. forces
to the task and then failed as in Vietnam and Somalia.</I> 
<P>
Moreover, it is not clear that the Clinton Administration understands
how to use force and the threat of force to establish and maintain
credibility, and achieve goals.
<P>
B) Is deployment of U.S. troops necessary to preserve NATO? We
do not know what kind of commitment was made by the Administration
to NATO. Neither do we know how many NATO countries have committed
to participate, nor on what terms.
<P>
Several NATO countries Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Turkey,
the United States and France (the French are still not members
of NATO) have had troops in and around former Yugoslavia for two
or three years operating as part of a United Nations force, under
U.N. command and as part of a NATO force as well. Much effort
and billions of dollars have achieved almost nothing.
<P>
U.S. forces have participated in the conflict in Bosnia through
air and sea missions conducted under the auspices of NATO. U.S.
ships have monitored enforcement of economic and arms embargoes.
U.S. planes and pilots have relieved pressure on UNPROFOR forces
under attack, carried out air drops of food and medicine to populations
under siege, monitored the &quot;no fly&quot; zones established
in U.N. Security Council Resolution 781, monitored the installation
by Serb forces of air defenses, rescued Capt. Scott O'Grady, conducted
the first non-lethal air strikes ever, and provided high altitude
surveillance of Serb activities including confirmation of the
movement of Serb tanks across the border to participate in the
assault on Srebrenica and of mass murder of Bosnian males following
the fall of Srebrenica last July.
<P>
Until now NATO's participation in former Yugoslavia has been carried
out under a &quot;double key&quot; command system which requires
United Nations' authorization for each operation authorization
that was granted slowly and with reluctance.
<P>
NATO air power has not been used effectively and has not been
successful. More serious is the fact that these arrangements have
reflected the preferences of the United States' NATO allies.
<P>
<I>Our NATO allies</I> the British, Dutch, Belgians and French
(the French are still not members of NATO) <I>preferred peacekeeping
under U.N command.</I> The United States, stung from the Somalia
experience, did not place U.S. forces directly under U.N. command
in former Yugoslavia, but closely coordinated U.S. and NATO operations
with and recognized the authority of the U.N. Secretary General
and his Representative over NATO operations. <I>The result was
to undermine NATO's credibility and effectiveness.</I> 
<P>
So, is it true that U.S. refusal to participate with ground troops
in a new phase of peacekeeping in Bosnia would weaken NATO? I
find it unpersuasive that U.S. refusal to send 25,000 ground troops
for peacekeeping duties on the ground would further weaken an
already weakened NATO.
<P>
Deployment of 60,000 troops may simply bring inside NATO disagreements
among allies on tactics that have so far taken place outside the
NATO framework.
<P>
<B>IV. Taking into account these factors, should the United States deploy 25,000 troops in former Yugoslavia?</B> 
<P>
Not unless President Clinton makes a persuasive case for this
deployment.
<P>
Not if there are alternative strategies that could contain aggression.
<P>
So far the alternatives have not been authoritatively tried or
even considered at least publicly. They should be. Bill Clinton
should make his case to the people and take his case to the Congress.
<P>
Not unless there is clear understanding and agreement among NATO
members concerning command it should be an American and rules
of engagement they should authorize the use of overwhelming force
in response to attacks on people.
<P>
Not unless there is a realistic prospect that the peace in the
region can be maintained after the departure of U.S. troops.
<P>
That requires 1) <I>defensible borders for Bosnia Herzegovina</I>,
and 2) <I>lifting the arms embargo against Bosnia Herzegovina
and helping equip and train Bosnian armed forces</I> so that they
can defend themselves as Croatia can now defend itself.
<P>
I continue to believe that there is promise in a &quot;lift and
strike&quot; policy in which the United States (and NATO if so
inclined) accepts responsibility for the arming and training of
Bosnian military forces. I think such a policy could prevent recurrence
of aggression and the spread of war if it were reinforced by an
active American diplomacy and a substantial U.S. presence in the
area.
<P>
I do not know why the Clinton Administration has not tried a &quot;lift
and strike&quot; strategy to create a peace which could last.
I suspect it is because of the reluctance of our allies to &quot;take
sides.&quot; But only a policy which faces facts, takes sides,
punishes aggressors, and leaves defensible borders can meet American
standards and American goals.
<P>
I fear the same reluctance of the same Allies may encourage the
Administration to design a strategy that does not provide a solution,
but requires 25,000 U.S. ground troops. That would be a great
mistake.
<P>
We need realistic plans, realistic means, and goals consistent
with our ideals.

<title>Clinton Fails to Make Case for American Troops -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>

<h3>CLINTON FAILS TO MAKE THE CASE FOR AMERICAN TROOPS IN BOSNIA</h3>

By John Hillen<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 437<br>
October 23, 1995<br>
<hr size=3 width=50%></center><p>

	The Clinton Administration's plan to use 25,000 American troops to implement a Bosnian peace accord is being exposed as a haphazard and risky enterprise.  In hearings on Capitol Hill last week, members of the Senate and House questioned the political and military rationale behind the Bosnia peace plan deployment.  These questions focused on the mission's political goals, its military objectives, the probability of success, the risks entailed, and the support of the American people.  Robert McNamara recently noted in his memoirs that the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations failed to address these fundamental issues in the early debates over Vietnam.  It appears that the Clinton Administration is ready to fall into the same trap.
<p>
	The Clinton plan puts the cart before the horse.  Instead of making a troop commitment that is tailored to support a specific and workable peace accord, President Clinton made a commitment for 25,000 U.S. ground troops before he knew what the peace accord would entail -- an arbitrary pledge over two years ago. This backwards strategy forces a political plan onto an abstract military force requirement.  Members of Congress were correct to question why the Administration is attempting to force 25,000 U.S. ground troops onto a plan that does not yet exist.  In addition, the congressional hearings last week made it clear that the Clinton troop request is a mission looking for a purpose.  These hearings raised many prescient questions and issues that remain neither answered nor resolved:
<p>
	<b>1)  What are the objectives, and how does America know when they have been achieved?</b>  The American "Implementation Force" has no clearly defined and attainable military goals and no specific criteria by which the U.S. commanders can measure their success.  The Clinton plan fails to address military objectives and commits American forces to static picket duty in an interpositional buffer zone.  The American forces are supposed to sit there and "monitor" infractions of the peace accord.  General Lewis MacKenzie, a Canadian who commanded the first United Nations troops in Sarajevo, told Members of Congress last week that, of all the various national contingents, U.S. troops would be the primary targets for disgruntled belligerents.  He also told the House National Security Committee that while the Administration may try to portray the Implementation Force as a neutral "peacekeeping" presence, the United States will be perceived as the enemy by one side in the conflict.  He re-emphasized the danger to U.S. forces by adding that if he were an American military officer, he "wouldn't touch this mission with a ten-foot pole." 
<p>	<b>2) There is no exit strategy.</b>  Precisely because American forces do not have well-defined and achievable military goals, "mission creep" is inherent in the Clinton peace plan.  With the Administration under enormous pressure to succeed after deploying 25,000 troops, President Clinton will be sorely tempted to escalate American military efforts when faced with the inevitable resistance of the warring factions. To forestall this, the Administration plan calls for a time-driven scenario in which the American forces will be pulled out in twelve months.  Almost all the Members of Congress recognized that this is a purely political decision and were extremely skeptical when General John Shalikashvili defended this timetable for unexplained "operational reasons."  This is shameless political grandstanding on the part of President Clinton, and Congress rightly called his bluff.  As former Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard Perle testified, "An exit date is not an exit strategy."
<P>	<b>3) The Clinton team has anticipated and planned for a best-case scenario.</b>  Military planning, down to the lowest levels, always takes into account worst-case scenarios.  Military leaders must plan for what to do when anything and everything goes wrong.  Because this plan represents an ill-defined mission taking place in the volatile Balkans, there is every reason to believe that unexpected events will be a fixture. Senators were rightly astounded when Secretary of Defense William Perry stated that he "could not conceive of circumstances where troops would stay longer" than the one-year target date. This comment exposed the political and military naivet that permeates the Clinton Administration. There are no contingency plans to address a scenario other than the fanciful best-case scenario anticipated by the Administration.  Should there be anything less than cooperation by the Bosnian parties, America would be forced either to cut and run or to reinforce troops in Bosnia and escalate military efforts to make the peace plan succeed.  The testimony of General MacKenzie made it clear that, despite Secretary Perry's optimism, American troops will have a rough time of it in Bosnia.
<p>	The Administration plan to deploy American ground forces has much to answer for, especially in regard to the fundamental questions that policymakers must address when contemplating the deployment of American combat troops into dangerous environments.  The Clinton team did not provide satisfactory answers to Congress, either on these fundamental issues or on a host of other questions about the mission.  The Administration has not clearly articulated its political and military goals in Bosnia. As Secretary of State Warren Christopher himself admitted after the hearings, "No, we haven't yet made the case." Most important, the Administration has not explained why the U.S. needs to send 25,000 ground troops to Bosnia and how a 12-month deployment can make a decisive contribution to a lasting peace in Bosnia.

<title>Conditions for Sending U.S. Troops to Bosnia -- Heritage Foundation</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><i><h3>CONDITIONS FOR SENDING U.S. TROOPS TO BOSNIA</h3></i>

By John Hillen, Policy Analyst <br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 66<br>
October 11, 1995<br></center>
<p>

	The President has promised to send 25,000 U.S. troops to Bosnia to police a peace settlement. He should not do so without the approval of Congress. Any operation as risky and potentially long-reaching as this one demands the full participation and approval of the House and Senate, and Congress should ensure that certain conditions are met before American troops are sent to Bosnia. While affirming the principle that all American forces, including ground troops, can be used in lesser regional conflicts and peacekeeping operations in Europe, Congress also should note the special risks and dangers associated with the Bosnian peace plan and ensure that specific criteria are met before American troops are deployed.
<p>
	As Congress debates whether U.S. troops should be committed in Bosnia, it should remember that:
<p><ul>
<li>America must lead in NATO, but sound leadership demands that the U.S. question a mission with ambiguous goals and ill-defined objectives. Washington should commit to NATO operations in principle but should not support losing propositions.
<p>
<li>The promised 25,000 American troops would cost two to three times more than the $1 billion - $2 billion estimated by the Clinton Administration.
<p>
<li>The Administration has not spelled out a coherent military plan that specifies the exact mission of the troops, the criteria to determine the success of that mission, timetables, rules of engagement, or command and control arrangements (especially concerning Russian participation).
<p>
<li>The plan to send 50,000 - 70,000 heavily armed NATO troops is clear evidence that this mission is an exercise in peace-enforcement, not peacekeeping, as the Administration claims. NATO troops will be authorized to undertake limited offensive operations against warring factions that violate the conditions of the peace accord. 
<p>
<li>Because of this, "mission creep," the unintentional acceptance of new missions and mandates, is built into this plan. As in Somalia, there will be pressure to increase operations and reinforce troops in order to "succeed."
<p>
<li>U.S. forces will not be accepted as impartial peacekeepers. The U.S. recently launched a comprehensive air campaign against the Bosnian Serbs and announced plans to train the Bosnian Muslim Army during the Bosnian deployment. The U.S. is no longer neutral in this conflict. This phenomenon also occurred in Lebanon in 1983 and Somalia in 1993, where the lives of American Marines and soldiers were needlessly lost because America failed to appreciate that belligerents viewed the U.S. as a combatant.</ul><p>

<b>THE ROLE OF CONGRESS</b>
<p>
The Congress should:<p><ul>

<li>Insist on full congressional approval for any deployment of U.S. troops to Bosnia;
<p>
<li>Hold hearings to determine the feasibility of U.S. participation in a Bosnian peace force; and
<p>
<li>Insist that the President meet the following conditions prior to any deployment of U.S. forces:
<p>
<li>Establish that U.S. national interests are threatened in Bosnia-Herzegovina;
<p>
<li>Publicize exactly what military commitments the Administration has made to both NATO and the Bosnian government;
<p>
<li>Establish that the peace accord is not merely another transient cease-fire, but a politically sustainable agreement;
<p>
<li>Confirm that all parties have withdrawn to clearly recognizable lines of demarcation that can be policed efficiently by a NATO force;
<p>
<li>State strategic and operational objectives for the U.S. force that are clearly defined, attainable, and sustainable; 
<p>
<li>Describe the exit strategy and clear criteria for determining mission success, including an "escape clause" in case the peace accord proves ephemeral;
<p>
<li>State the deployment, rotation, and redeployment timetables, as well as whether they are event-driven or time-driven;
<p>
<li>State clearly the mission cost and the effect on U.S. strategic readiness posture;
<p>
<li>Present a well-defined command and control structure that clearly addresses the role of Russian forces;
<p>
<li>Ensure that there is no overlap of responsibility and authority with the United Nations Protection Force, which should be entirely separate from the NATO chain of command;
<p>
<li>Present contingency plans for various scenarios that realistically address additional resources, cost, and operational feasibility;
<p>
<li>Submit a multinational force structure and command and control plan that ensures unity of command and effort among the many nations taking part; 
<p>
<li>Demonstrate that there are clear rules of engagement that are compatible with U.S. training and doctrine, with American forces not to be given static and passive missions that allow them only to react to initiatives of the warring belligerents;
<p>
<li>Ensure that U.S. troops will be deployed in sufficient strength to guarantee force protection and fully supported operations (no "token" force should be deployed in a dangerous theater); and
<p>
<li>Explain how past U.S. actions in Bosnia are consistent with a "peacekeeping" role.	   
</ul><P>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
There is clear evidence that American ground troops could imperil a Bosnian peace force by discrediting its impartial standing. Instead of committing large numbers of ground forces, the U.S. should play to its strengths by supporting this mission with capabilities that only the U.S. can contribute. These include strategic airlift, logistics, intelligence, and combat air support if necessary. American ground troops offer no tactical or operational advantage to a Bosnian peace force. They offer only political advantage for reluctant European allies.
<p>
	The U.S. should agree, in principle, to deploy its military forces (including ground troops) to assist in peacekeeping operations in Europe. But the Bosnian peace plan is not peacekeeping; it is peace enforcement. As yet, there is no reliable or sustainable peace settlement in Bosnia. When there is, the U.S. should consider sending in any forces necessary, but only if the foregoing conditions are met.

<title>The Risks of Clinton's Bosnia Peace Plan -- Heritage Foundation</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<i><h3>THE RISKS OF CLINTON'S BOSNIA PEACE PLAN</h3></i>
By John Hillen, Policy Analyst<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Backgrounder Update No. 262<br>
October 10, 1995<br>
(Updating <i>Backgrounder Update</i> No. 250, "Clinton's Bosnia Folly," June 2, 1995, and <i>Backgrounder</i> No. 1012, "Don't Let Bosnia Destroy NATO," December 28, 1994.)
<hr size=3 width=50%></center>
<p>
	The impending diplomatic breakthrough in the Balkans has raised the prospect of a substantial American and allied military operation to police a Bosnian peace accord. Such an operation undoubtedly would entail an exercise in "peace-enforcement," with United States and allied troops using limited and selective enforcement measures to ensure the compliance of warring factions. 
<p>
	Knowing that this will not present U.S. forces either with a clearly defined, attainable military mission or with a decisive political objective, the Clinton Administration will try to sell the plan as a temporary and innocuous "peacekeeping" operation. The Administration maintains that this would involve only the limited deployment of approximately 25,000 American troops at a cost of $1 billion. But some experts have concluded that the operation would cost two or three times this much and that it probably would involve more than 25,000 American troops over a period of several years. 
<p>
	In much the same way, the Bush Administration tried to sell the Somalia operation as a limited humanitarian enterprise. In fact, the Administration's initial pronouncements even suggested that the troops would be home in seven weeks, by Inauguration Day. But American troops did not leave Somalia until some 16 months later, their good work obscured by the Ranger debacle in Mogadishu, the incoherence of a United Nations-managed peace-enforcement operation, and the renewal of clan warfare in Somalia. The Clinton Administration's planned deployment of American troops to Bosnia is fraught with much greater danger than was faced in Somalia and raises several strategic dilemmas. Some of these, concerning mission objectives, timetables, command and control, and rules of engagement, have been raised by GOP leaders in Congress. Others still need to be addressed:
<p>
<b>NATO Involvement.</b> Because of a rash promise by President Clinton, the U.S. is committed to a major role in implementing a Bosnian peace plan. This in itself should spark a major debate. How did NATO, America's principal security alliance, become a back-door conduit for heavy ground involvement in a conflict of marginal interest to U.S. security concerns? 
<p>
	In 1992, the world heard that this was the "hour of Europe"; in 1995, the U.S. hears once again that its European allies are leery of decisive commitments in the absence of American leadership. The U.S. obviously must lead NATO, but saying no to an ill-conceived peace-enforcement mission with vague and undefined objectives is clearer evidence of leadership than throwing troops into a losing cause. Significant U.S. participation in any NATO enterprise should be contingent on two things:  a clear and present danger to the security and stability of Europe, and a mission with clearly defined political and military goals.
<p>
	Is NATO the proper vehicle for a Bosnian peace force?  Should an alliance starved of credibility and uncertain of its future structure tackle internecine, ethnic conflict in Bosnia?  A NATO Balkan peace-enforcement force could have several unfortunate consequences. For example, it could unleash dissension at the very time NATO is trying to expand. Much as Somalia split the U.N. coalition, the ups and downs of the Bosnian mission could split the European alliance. Faced with the demonstrated intransigence of the belligerents, NATO could experience a resumption of the divergent approaches and internal squabbling that plagued its response to Bosnia in 1993-1994. A Bosnian peace force, under current circumstances, has precious little to offer NATO during a critical phase in its evolution. NATO should not allow a poorly crafted, self-fulfilling prophesy to lure it into accepting this mission.  
<p>
<b>U.S. Troops as "Peacekeepers."</b>  Peacekeeping is an exercise in which the peacekeepers are accepted as honest brokers, neutral and impartial. Because peacekeepers are deployed after an accord has been reached, they operate only in a supervisory role and are forced to rely on the good will and cooperation of the belligerents. President Clinton claims that the U.S. force would be structured for a "peaceful" and "uneventful" mission. 
<p>
	But as currently planned, this would not be a classic peacekeeping operation. So far in Bosnia there is no peace to keep. If U.S. ground troops are sent into Bosnia without a firm peace settlement, they will not be going in as neutrals. The United States, for better or for worse, has just completed a sustained air offensive against one side in the Bosnian conflict. While America may see itself as the impartial hand that "leveled the playing field," the Bosnian Serbs most certainly do not. They were on the receiving end of hundreds of airstrikes from NATO aircraft and American cruise missiles. In addition, the Clinton Administration plans to train the Bosnian Muslim forces while simultaneously acting as peacekeepers. Does the Administration really think the Serbs will accept American ground troops as impartial and neutral peacekeepers? 
<p>
	The U.S. has made this hazardous assumption twice before in recent years:  In Lebanon, in 1983, U.S. air and naval forces attacked Druze and Shiite militia positions while maintaining a "neutral" peacekeeping force in Beirut. Within days of the strikes, over 240 U.S. Marines were dead after a terrorist suicide strike against their barracks. 
<p>
	In Somalia, the U.S. also chose to attack one belligerent party while professing neutrality. The actions against Mohammed Aideed's party drew American troops into the conflict as if they were yet another local faction -- the only one without the political will to slug it out in the bloody back streets of Mogadishu.
<p>
<b>"Mission Creep."</b> Mission creep, the unintentional acceptance of new missions and mandates, is built into the Clinton plan for a Bosnian peace force. A force of 25,000 American soldiers is the absolute minimum needed to give the U.S. the security it needs to operate in Bosnia. A smaller force would be hopelessly exposed and unable to accomplish much of anything.  
<p>
	Since 25,000 troops are the minimum for protection alone, the question becomes how a peace plan will be imposed on the belligerents. The answer could be:  Call for more troops. This is exactly what happened in Somalia after the street battles of October 3, 1993. Within weeks, Clinton was forced to deploy an additional 15,000 troops to Somalia to ensure the security of a few thousand American soldiers operating with the U.N. mission. A force of 25,000 American troops for Bosnia anticipates a best-case scenario. Any deterioration of this scenario must lead to greater American participation. 
<p>


<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
	The President's idea of peacekeeping in Bosnia would not be peacekeeping at all.  As yet, there is no peace to keep. The Clinton plan amounts to peace-enforcement in a dangerous and hostile environment. This is why NATO is planning for 50,000-70,000 heavily armed combat troops and not the lightly armed observers more common to peacekeeping missions. 
<p>
	Should a truly conclusive peace settlement be reached in Bosnia, and peacekeeping become possible, America should support a NATO peace force with strategic airlift, logistics, intelligence, and -- in the case of extreme emergency -- combat air support and possibly some ground troops. There is nothing to gain, either for America or for the peacekeeping force, by deploying substantial American ground forces in this risky adventure. American ground troops offer no operational advantage to the force. They are merely a political backstop for reluctant European allies. Based upon America's experiences in Lebanon and Somalia, it is obvious that participation by American ground troops could damage mission credibility and undermine the peace America and its allies are attempting to preserve. 
<p>
	While the U.S. should agree in principle to support NATO peace-enforcement operations when they make sense -- in other words, when the mission and political objectives are clear -- it should not commit itself to a deal that is bound to fail. In order to honor U.S. security commitments, America should be willing to deploy troops for lesser regional conflicts, and even for peacekeeping. However, it should do so only in cases where the benefits of success outweigh the risks of failure. The Clinton "peacekeeping" plan is not one of those cases.

<H2>Bennett: Politics Aside</H2>
</center>
During the last three decades, America has experienced an unprecedented degree of social regression. If things continue the way they are going, we may well see the end of the American experiment in ordered liberty. To be more specific: if current trends in juvenile crime, illegitimacy, family disintegration, community breakup, education, and drug use continue, this experiment in self-government will end. This is a conclusion based on a disinterested analysis of social facts. After all, there is nothing inevitable about this experiment. Our system of ordered liberty was brought about by will and thought and reflection, not by chance. The Founders said that we would have to maintain certain efforts to keep it together. Some of those efforts are being maintained. But many are not.
<p>
During our Candidate School, you have heard from some people we regard as among the ablest and smartest around in various policy areas. Public policy is crucial; here at Empower America, we are trying to advance the most intelligent and thoughtful policies we can. But I believe the cultural arena is even more important. That is not to say that cultural ideas can't be significantly influenced by people in politics. Indeed, they can. But I have to say, I think it probably matters more for the cultural future of this country what happens in movies and television, and on the radio and in classrooms, than what happens on Capitol Hill.
<p>
Talk to a group of teenagers and tell me if they sound more to you like they're listening to C-Span or MTV. And I will tell you: they sound a lot more like MTV. This doesn't diminish the political task. It just makes it clear that there are other tasks as well. And of course the two are related.
<p>
I think that if the philosophy of life being promulgated in TV commercials, movies. television and other cultural media changed, it would probably bring about more of a positive change in American life than virtually any piece of legislation we can imagine.
<p>
There is the belief among many of the people who have the most power and influence to shape attitudes that the most important obligation in life is to yourself, that your duties are to yourself - not to God, not to country, not to work, or family, or wife, or children, but to self. And if self is not happy or satisfied. then it must take priority. This, in my view, is a social disaster and an invitation to barbarism. It is a dagger aimed at the heart of our society. But it prevails in many quarters . It has been given to us by some intellectuals. Much of Hollywood pushes that view. And it is central to much of contemporary liberalism. I think it is poisoning the moral environment of America.
<p>
Bad philosophy has destroyed the lives of many people in this country. It has destroyed many homes, many communities, and will continue to unless we confront it directly. If you do try to fight this thing by taking on its proponents, you will be in for one heck of a fight. But it is a fight worth having. Indeed, it is one of the fights that matters most.

Empower America's <i>Highlights</i>

<H2>Kemp: Growth and Hope</H2>
</center>
Empower America was founded to present conservatism's positive face, on the premise that the instincts of the American people arc naturally optimistic and that their values are predicated upon the virtues of a Judeo-Christian society . We believe that conservatives should always be forward looking, not backward looking; optimistic, not pessimistic; confident, not timid; and inclusive, not exclusive.
<p>
You cannot lead anybody with pessimism. Can you imagine a quarterback going into the huddle and saying, "Gosh, it's hot out here. Wow, those guys are big over there. I know this play has never worked before, but I don't know what else to do. Let's try it again." No great adventure has ever been led by anybody who says it can't be done. Leadership has to be predicated upon confidence in one's own abilities as well as on a belief in the inevitability of ultimate victory.
<p>
Leadership should be centered around a world view of hope, optimism, confidence, and the ultimate achievement of victory - for the right reason. The Bible says overcome evil, overcome it with good. Conservatives are obligated morally, not only to indict darkness, but to also light candles; not only to be against that which is bad, but also to be for empowering and unleashing the potential of the human spirit.
<p>
A great conservative named Oswald Spengler wrote <i>Decline of the West</i> in 1931. He was pessimistic about democracy. He thought that democracy wouldn't survive against fascism and Nazism. One of the founders of <i>National Review</i>, James Burnham, wrote <i>Suicide of the West</i>. He said we were going to commit suicide because democracy wouldn't work. Jean Francois Ravel, another leading conservative, wrote a book in which he said democracy will turn out to be a parenthesis in the history of the world.
<p>
Unlike these men, I'm an optimist. I always knew we would win. Sometimes, however, it has been tough maintaining this positive outlook. I know there are problems. Human rights abuses continue in China, the Middle East, and Bosnia Despite these problems, democracy has defeated all of the "isms" of years past - absolutism, fascism, Nazism, and communism.
<p>
Socialism is dead intellectually. Isolated pockets remain in Cuba, North Korea, and in the economics departments of some of our Ivy League colleges, but very few people today talk about socialism as an answer to poverty. In my view, there is only one real answer to poverty: a system based on private property, limited government, the rule of law, and entrepreneurial capitalism. The Left has tried to make Americans feel guilty about this kind of a system - to envy the rich, to desire a redistribution of wealth, and to centralize power. Thanks to computers and the telecommunications revolution, much of the world now has instantaneous access to information. This revolution will be the ultimate undoing of modern liberalism's centralizing tendencies. Markets will be energized, unleashed, and individualized. In this new environment, mistakes in government policies can cause capital to flow out of a country as fast as it flows in. All of this means that governments cannot control commerce like they used to.
<p>
My entire political career has been dedicated to the proposition that conservatives should be positive and optimistic and demonstrate a concern for the underdogs in our society. It is outrageous that conservatives have allowed liberals to steal genuinely good words - welfare, for instance. Don't think of welfare in terms of what the Left has described. I care about the "welfare" of my family. Welfare is not a bad word. We have allowed it to become synonymous with government handouts . What welfare really means is the well-being of someone. Conservatives <i>should</i> care about the welfare of the American people. We <i>should</i> want everyone to be able to get a good education, get a job, get married, have children, and move up the economic ladder.
<p>
People don't care how much you know until they know that you care. That is why conservatives must be inclusive. We have got to show South Central Los Angeles that we care about them just as much as we care about Wall Street. If our policies will not work in East Saint Louis, how can we sell them to Russia or Eastern Europe?
<p>
I proposed the idea of free enterprise zones for the District of Columbia in order to enhance the city's ability to recover its middle class. Two hundred thousand families have moved out of D.C. over the past 15 years because of taxes, crime, and a lack of educational quality. I helped introduce a Hong Kong-like tax code for D.C. because we have to do something radical to save the nation's capital. Many liberals in Washington knocked my head off, saying, 'There goes Jack Kemp again, trying to help the rich, only thinking of himself." Recently, D.C.'s Delegate, Eleanor Holmes Norton, introduced a Hong Kong-like tax code for the District of Columbia. A flat, 15 percent income tax for the whole city. She is an African-American and a liberal Democrat. She introduced my bill for D.C. within 24 hours. She called it "The Economic Recovery Act." With that kind of a strategy, how can the Left say that conservatives don't care about the welfare of the poorest among us?
<p>
Liberals have shown that they care by putting people on welfare. Conservatives have got to show people how to get off of it, and how to get into jobs and education and the type of opportunity for which we are working. Every single voter - regardless of color, regardless of residence - is a potential consumer you have to communicate with. If you understand your job, your product, and treat people with care and concern, even though they may not vote for you, you've done a service for conservatives. If we have a good product, conservatives ought to be able to sell it in any area and to anyone in the United States.
<p>
Conservatism and optimism are not mutually exclusive. I believe that successful candidates for public office in 1996 and beyond will be the ones who embrace policies and strategies that exhibit both of these qualities. It means advocating a message of hope and it means supporting ideas that will spur economic growth. How you execute your campaign, how you approach leadership, what your attitude is toward people is essential to the outcome. Does anybody doubt that? Whether it's a huddle, a home, a business, or politics, your attitude will determine the outcome of your endeavor. If you've got the right outlook, the willingness to succeed, and the love in your heart for this country, your message and the strength of your ideas will be more powerful than any army in the history of mankind.

<p>
<H2>Kirkpatrick: US Credibility</H2>
</center>
I am pleased to be at this Empower America event with all of you candidates who are running for office and hoping to turn good ideas into the policies of the United States, at the local, state and national level. I'm sure you're going to know what to do after you're elected: to implement the policies that create free people, that strengthen free people, that expand and protect freedom, and that encourage the ingenuity, enterprise and energy that free people apply in situations where initiative and enterprise are permitted to prevail.
<p>
Our foreign policy is - always and inevitably - an expression of our government and our society, our will and our purpose, as is every government's foreign policy an expression of the morality and purposes of that society and that government. Policies of a government are not likely to be much better than the quality of its government - at least not for long. This is especially so in national security matters, where credibility depends directly on the government's strength and also its will. I firmly believe that American credibility, and the appreciation of our strength and our purpose, is our most important asset in the conduct of foreign affairs and national security. I believe the Clinton Administration has been squandering American credibility, power, reputation and respect in the world. I think our credibility has declined along with our military strength. There is a very real correlation - it is an unfortunate correlation when you are weak, and a fortunate one when you are strong - between strength and respect. We have been the strongest government and country in the world. We probably still are the strongest country in the world, but we are a good deal less strong than we were four or five years ago. We are a good deal less strong than we were when the Berlin Wall came down. We are a good deal less strong than we were when Bill Clinton was inaugurated.
<p>
When our credibility suffers, those leaders contending for ultimate power, in, for example, China, are strengthened. Those most likely to use force, like firing missiles to threaten Taiwan, are strengthened. And when our credibility suffers, North Korean dictators, like Kim Jong II, are more likely to violate the demilitarized zone, and more likely to offer new challenges to South Korea and other neighbors. And when American credibility suffers, the governments of countries like Iran, Syria and Libya are greatly encouraged.
<p>
We are becoming less strong because our military - our forces and our weapons, our research and development - are being permitted to decline by the refocusing of attention and reallocation of resources in the Defense Department. Generals in the Defense Department are confessing, reluctantly, to committee chairmen in the House National Security Committee that the level and rate of procurement which the Administration is providing for our future is not adequate to provide for our future. The military will be short of a good many things that we need. Already training budgets have been displaced by what are thought to be more urgent needs. Our armed forces' spare parts budgets have been raided for what are thought to be more urgent needs. And our research and development is just simply neglected.
<p>
The Clinton Administration has doggedly declined to invest in a missile defense for the United States, not facing the fact that if we don't develop a missile defense, we will not be able to help anyone else defend themselves against missiles either. Apparently, it occurred to the President recently that Israel might need some help with missile defense, and announced that the United States would assume that responsibility. The fact that some systems exist for missile defense comes from the research and development that was undertaken in the Reagan Administration. This was for a much larger missile defense program, one which would be able to defend you and the citizens you hope will vote for you, one to protect and defend the whole country. Unfortunately, Bill Clinton has shut down almost all of this program in the last three years. One hopes that he will reconsider missile defense for the United States.
<p>
This President is not oriented toward thinking about defense. He is not oriented toward providing for American strength. He is, in fact, reluctant to think about strength. The whole Administration is reluctant to think about strength, including even the Defense Department, of all the places to be reluctant to think about strength. The President and the Administration, the Secretary of Defense, have gone forth into the world again and again, carrying a very large carrot to deal with very disagreeable dictators, like Kim Jong II of North Korea, like Syria's Assad, like Fidel Castro, like some of the Chinese some of the time.
<p>
I believe that the decline in our credibility has already produced unfortunate experiences, such as the shooting down of American planes and the murder of American pilots over international waters near Cuba. Even though our media kept talking about Cuban exiles, those were American citizens flying very small, unarmed, American planes, which were shot down near Cuba. And what happened after they were shot down, unprovoked, these unarmed planes which had done no harm to anyone? What happened? Actually what happened, of course, was nothing happened. Nothing at all, there was no retribution of any kind. I don't know what Ronald Reagan would have done in that situation. But the point is, we don't know because Fidel Castro wouldn't have done something like that when Ronald Reagan was president. Muammar Khaddafi did something like it when Ronald Reagan was President, and he found out what Ronald Reagan would have done. <p>
The fact is that when America is strong and America is purposeful, and we stand with democracies, and we stand with freedom, we strengthen peoples and countries who share our values. The whole world profits. When our strength declines, and our credibility, strength and purpose are questioned by thugs, the world becomes more dangerous.

<H2>Candidate School Sets Out Fall Course</H2>
</center>
The notion that "ideas have consequences" is central to the work and mission of Empower America, and was at the core of Empower America's 1996 Candidate School held on April 29th in Washington, D.C. Candidates and campaign strategists from local, state and national races in twenty-four states met with Empower America's Co-Directors and leading policy experts for a detailed discussion of the issues that are central to the 1996 elections.
<p>
In his welcoming remarks, Empower America Co-Director Vin Weber told the candidates, "Our organization was founded in order to bring important political ideas to the forefront of our national debate, where they can be vigorously deliberated and acted upon. Empower America's candidate training school and briefing book are just one part of that broad effort. Our intention is to reach beyond the necessary issues of campaign management (i.e., polling, fundraising, advertising and organization) to the <i>intellectual</i> content of the political process. Our ambitious goal is to help seed the national political debate with substantive thought. We believe it is that dedication to ideas and issues that distinguishes this instruction."
<p>
The seminar was opened by Empower America Co-Director Jack Kemp, who spoke of unleashing America's economic potential. The path to the American dream must be opened, said Kemp, by reforming the tax code; removing barriers to work, savings and investment; and by opening the possibilities for all citizens to gain access to capital and credit.
<p>
Jack Kemp's remarks were followed by a panel of economic policy experts discussing three of the most significant reforms necessary for economic growth. Dan Mitchell of the Heritage Foundation offered a detailed discussion of tax reform; Mike Horowitz of the Hudson Institute described the need for tort and regulatory reform; and John Goodman of the National Center for Policy Analysis (N.C.P.A.) addressed a topic that is about to become a leading economic and political issue: the privatization of Social Security.
<p>
A second panel, entitled <i>E Pluribus Unum</i>, tackled the fragmentation of American society. Stuart Anderson of the Cato Institute described the benefits of legal immigration and the unwise nature of current anti-immigration initiatives; David Murray of Statistical Assessment Service offered an excellent explanation of the true nature of American "oneness" and the pitfalls of "multiculturalism"; and Brian Jones of the Center for New Black Leadership spoke of the social harm produced by preferential policies based on race and gender.
<p>
Panel three turned its attention to devolution of societal responsibilities from government to civil society, and the need to rebuild and strengthen community institutions. The speakers were three leaders in that effort Adam Meyerson of the Heritage Foundation, editor of <i>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship;</i> Robert Woodson of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, a pioneer in community and individual self-help efforts; and Mike Gerson. policy director for Sen. Dan Coates, who spoke on behalf of the Senator's 19-point legislative program to strengthen civil society, the Project for American Renewal.
<p>
At lunch the candidates heard from former United Nations Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick discussing foreign policy and the erosion of America's hard-earned credibility and worldwide leadership during the Clinton presidency.
<p>
Two afternoon panels instructed the participants on a wide range of domestic issues. and on the experiences of the 104th Congress . Domestic issues were covered by five of the top thinkers in their fields. John J. DiIulio covered crime; former assistant Drug Czar John P. Walters discussed drugs; Chester E. Finn of the Hudson Institute spoke on education; Merrill Matthews of the N.C.P.A.'s Center for Health Policy Studies reviewed health care; and the former Director of the U.S. National Center on Child Abuse and Neglect, Douglas Besharov, spoke about welfare.
<p>
Three leaders of the Freshman class of the 104th Congress conducted a lively question and answer session during the final panel, informing the candidates from their own experience. Congresswoman Sue Myrick (9-NC), Congressman Sam Brownback (2-KS) and Congressman Dave McIntosh (2-IN) urged the attendees to join their "revolution" to reduce government and return power and responsibility to Americans.
<p>
The final remarks were delivered by Empower America Co-Director William J. Bennett. Dr. Bennett spoke of the need for cultural and societal renewal in America, and of the forces and policies that have weakened our culture. His address wrapped up a day that several candidates described as bringing focus and a winning edge into their strategy. "So much good information." said a candidate for U.S. Senate, "I'd do it again."

<H2>EA Releases Influential lmmigration Study</H2>
</center>
At a recent press conference in Washington, DC, William Bennett and Jack Kemp released a study sponsored by Empower America about employment-based immigration. The report, <i>Employment-Based Immigration and High Technology: Issues and Recommendations,</i> examines the impact on the wages and employment opportunities of native-born Americans produced by the employment of foreign-born engineers and scientists.
<p>
The author of the study, Stuart Anderson, a visiting scholar at the Cato Institute, compiled data from the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) and conducted interviews with engineering and computer industry corporate leaders to determine if immigrants hurt job opportunities for American engineers and scientists, as is commonly believed. The study concluded that U.S. high tech companies hire foreign-born engineers and scientists because, in these highly specialized industries, they frequently possess unique skills and fill key technical niches in the U.S. Iabor force.
<p>
Foreign born high-tech employees are not paid less than their U.S. counterparts, which is also commonly believed. Indeed, data from the NAS show that the median salaries of foreign-born engineers and scientists are significantly <i>higher</i>, not lower, than their native-born counterparts who completed their Ph.Ds in the same year. Furthermore, the study demonstrates more generally that foreign-born engineers and immigrants play a significant role in creating jobs in the high technology fields through entrepreneurship and innovation.
<p>
Calling the study a "wakeup call," Dr. Bennett and Secretary Kemp called the report "a warning specifically to those who believe that scaling back on legal immigration will help the American worker. Friends of the American worker are by necessity defenders of immigration, for immigrants serve as a catalyst for economic growth. This study dispels the myth that employing immigrants displaces American workers."
<p>
The study was distributed to all the members of the U.S. Congress as they considered legislation aimed at curbing legal immigration. Empower America's role in shaping the final outcome of this legislation was significant. Provisions aimed at reducing employment-based immigration were eliminated from the Senate bill; and, ultimately, the Senate voted to split their immigration reform bill by considering legal and illegal immigration separately. Similarly, the House passed a bill that cracks down on illegal immigration, but rejected provisions that would have reduced legal immigration by nearly one-third.

<H2>EA Announces New Leadership</H2>
</center>
The Board of Directors of Empower America has appointed Thomas W. Weisel as Chairman of the Board and Tex Lezar as President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Weisel served as Acting Chairman when Steve Forbes took a leave of absence as EA's Chairman to run for President in the Fall of 1995.
<p>
Weisel is founder, Chairman and CEO of Montgomery Securities in San Francisco one of the nation's leading securities firm. Under Weisel's leadership, Montgomery Securities' annual revenues have grown over the last 25 years to exceed $500 million. Weisel holds five National Master's titles in cycling and has served as Chairman of U.S. Skiing, the governing body of the U.S. ski team.
<p>
EA Co-Director Jack Kemp called Weisel, who specializes in taking smaller "growth" companies public, "the embodiment of the American dream." Kemp continued, "Thom has demonstrated in his professional life that entrepreneurial capitalism works. He has spent his life pushing entrepreneurs toward success. His real-world insight and world-class fundraising capabilities will continue to be of tremendous benefit to Empower America."
<p>
Empower America's new President and CEO, Tex Lezar, comes to the organization from Dallas, Texas, where he is engaged in private law practice. Lezar, who served as Assistant U.S. Attorney General under President Reagan and edited <i>Making Government Work A Conservative Agenda for the States</i>, has been a prominent litigator and appellate lawyer in Texas since 1977. In 1994, Lezar was the Republican nominee for Lieutenant Governor of Texas.
<p>
Bennett, Kemp, Kirkpatrick and Weber jointly said, "Tex Lezar comes from the school of Ronald Reagan and adheres to its credo - an optimistic faith in freedom, democratic capitalism, strong national defense and time-honored values. He has a sound knowledge of public policy and politics, and brings to Empower America the fruits of an impressive career in government, law, and politics. We are very pleased to have Tex aboard."
<p>
Steve Forbes will rejoin the Board of Directors and William Dal Col, Empower America's former President, will be working with Forbes while continuing to informally advise Empower America.
<p>
Nick Forstmann, Partner at Forstmann Little & Co., is Empower America's new Vice Chairman. He is a long-standing member of EA's Board of Directors.

<H2>Co-Directors Support Missile Defense</H2>
</center>
<i>The Defend America Act of 1996 (H.R. 3144) would mandate the development and deployment of a national missile defense by 2003 to protect all Americans against the threat of accidental or limited ballistic missile attack. Empower America Co-Directors Kirkpatrick, Kemp, Bennett, and Weber sent a letter to the entire House of Representatives urging that they vote in favor of this vital legislation. Excerpts from the letter follow:</i>
<p>
"Today, dozens of countries have or are seeking to acquire ballistic missiles and weapons of mass destruction. These include Iran, Iraq, North Korea, and Libya, to name a few. Incredibly, America still has no defense against this threat. Even a single missile launched at our nation - whether deliberately or by accident - would have tragic consequences, and, if it were armed with a nuclear, biological, or chemical warhead, the results would be catastrophic.
<p>
The technology exists today to move forward with a limited ballistic missile defense that is able to protect Americans in all 50 states - and to do so at an affordable cost. The Defend America Act would make it clear that Americans will no longer remain hostage to unlawful states and the decisions of their unpredictable rulers.
<p>
The Clinton Administration still refuses to take our vulnerability to a missile attack seriously. The Administration has said it does not foresee missile threats to the United States emerging in the next 15 years. They ignore the still formidable Russian and Chinese nuclear arsenals and place an historically unwarranted faith in the intelligence community's ability to recognize Third World missile threats in a timely manner - before they materialize. Our underestimation of the scope and magnitude of Iraq's missile program prior to the Gulf War is proof enough of this.
<p>
It is crucial to ensure that all Americans have the protection they deserve against threats to their security. But today, Americans have no protection against ballistic missile attack. We therefore urge you, in the strongest terms, to vote for the Defend America Act."

<H2>From Newspaper Opinion Pages...</H2>
</center>
<b>About "Same-Sex" Marriage </b><br>
"I believe that overall, allowing same-sex marriages would do significant, long-term social damage...Recognizing the legal union of gay and Iesbian couples would represent a profound change in the meaning and definition of marriage..Marriage is not an arbitrary construct; it is an 'honorable estate' based on the different, complementary nature of men and women - and how they refine, support, encourage and complete one another. To insist that we maintain this traditional understanding of marriage is not an attempt to:put others down. It is simply an acknowledgment and celebration of our most precious and important social act....It is exceedingly imprudent to conduct a radical, untested and inherently flawed social experiment on an institution that is the keystone in the arch of civilization. That we have to debate this issue at all tells us that the arch has slipped."<br>
      William J. Bennett, <i>Washington Post,</i> May 21, 1996<p>

<b>About Expanding NATO</b><br>
"Support for the admission to NATO of Eastern European democracies has been growing in Washington. A bill for which bipartisan support is expected has been drafted in the House International Relations Committee calling for NATO 'at early date' to include, at a minimum, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic.... There is no spirit of Munich here. The bill's authors believe - as I believe - that it is about time that the new democracies begin to enjoy the full benefits of freedom, including credible security. Should such a bill be acted on before the Russian elections? Will it damage Yeltsin's chances - as some have argued? I think not. A weak, timid West would be far more damaging. Yeltsin and the Russian democrats will win if it is clear that the resurgent communist/fascist spirit cannot prevail. Enlarging NATO will send just that message."<br>
      Jeane Kirkpatrick, <i>New York Post,</i> April 10, 1996<p>

<b>About a Flat Tax for Washington, DC</b><br>
"Our nation's macro economy is a democratic-capitalist economy based on private property and rewards for productive human activity. However, we also have a concurrent, micro economy that is almost a Third World socialist welfare state...and nowhere is it better illustrated than in our nation's capital, Washington, DC.... Spending cuts and fiscal restraints must be an integral part of any plan to relieve the current financial burden and restore credibility to the nation's capital. But we believe the most important step is for the District government and Congress to fully embrace the proposal to reinvigorate the District announced last month by Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District's non-voting delegate to the House of Representatives. Norton has introduced the DC Economic Recovery Act, also known as a progressive flat tax plan, which will create much needed jobs, expand the tax base and serve as a great enticement to middle-class families to come back home to Washington."<br>
      Jack Kemp, with DC Council member Kevin P. Chavous, <i>Washington Post,</i> May 5, 1996
<p>
<b>About Stable Money</b><br>
"Businesses bringing their goods and services to the international market place should not have to contend with unpredictable exchange rate fluctuations that transform legitimately earned profits into currency losses. What is necessary in today's global economy is not a European Monetary Union so much as a viable plan for international monetary reform aimed at serving the needs of an open world economy dedicated to free trade."<br>
      Judy Shelton, EA Board Member, <i>Wall Street Journal Europe,</i> April 25, 1996
<p>
<b>About Tax Reform</b><br>
"What's truly driving voter frustration is a desire for clarity - for sharp-edge, distinct alternatives on how to move the country ahead...instead of beginning our debate by arguing over what appears on Page 6,743 of the tax code, why not begin on Page One? If we're sincere about wanting the public to participate in the debate over tax reform, shouldn't we start deciding whether we want to keep the current system we have?"<br>
      Theodore J. Forstmann, EA Founding Chairman and Member of the Tax Reform
      Commission, <i>Washington Times,</i> April 5, 1996
<p>
<b>About "Rap Rubbish"</b><br>
"A question for parents: What would you do if you discovered that someone was encouraging your sons to kill people indiscriminately, to find fun in beating and raping girls, and to use the word 'motherf---er' at least once in every sentence?" <br>
      William J. Bennett, Joe Lieberman and C. DeLores Tucker, <i>USA Today,</i> June
      6, 1996

<H2>Rapping Obscene Music, Empower America Launches "Round Two" in Values Campaign </H2>
</center>
On May 30, Empower America launched "Round Two" of the campaign against obscene and harmful music Iyrics being produced and marketed by major entertainment companies. Empower America Co-Director William J. Bennett announced the venture at a joint press conference in Washington, DC, with Senator Joe Lieberman (CT), and C. DeLores Tucker, Chair of the National Political Congress of Black Women.
<P>
In this second round of the ongoing campaign, Dr. Bennett, Senator Lieberman, Dr . Tucker and Senator Sam Nunn (GA) released a radio ad calling on five of the largest music companies to end their involvement with degrading and indefensible music Iyrics. The ad targets music that glorifies murder and drug use, and that celebrates the beating and raping of women. The companies named in the ad and at the press conference are Time Warner, as well as foreign-owned Sony of Japan, Thorn EMI of Great Britain, PolyGram (owned by Philips Electronics) of the Netherlands, and Bertelsmann of Germany. The ad is airing on both national and local talk shows.
<P>
Listeners who hear the ad are encouraged to call Empower America's hotline to add their names to a petition being sent to the companies. The goal is to reach as many people as possible, who will, in turn. contact these companies and ask them to reconsider their support for this music.
<P>
Time Warner, the target of Empower America's first campaign against obscene music,took a positive step with their sale of Interscope Records last September. However, since that time, they have not limited their production and distribution of offensive music on some of their other labels. As a result, Empower America is again calling on Time Warner, as well as the other four foreign-owned corporations, to refuse to sponsor this cultural rot.
<P>
Prior to the press conference announcing the campaign, letters were sent to the heads of the corporations, and to their American subsidiaries, asking them to "make normative judgments about what is acceptable to produce and market" and calling on the corporations to "refuse to sponsor this vicious, vulgar music."
<P>
Empower America plans to continue efforts to focus scrutiny on obscene music Iyrics, and to ask major corporations to refuse to sponsor garbage. Said Empower America Co-Director William J. Bennett, "We are going to continue to put the heat and light on these guys...We're in it for the duration."

<H2>Virtue on Public Television This Fall</H2>
</center>
William Bennett's highly acclaimed anthology, The Book of Virtues, is being brought to life in a new, fully animated television series: "Adventures from The Book of Virtues." The new television show will premier in the fall on PBS.
<P>
Produced by PorchLight Entertainment in association with KCET in Los Angeles, "Adventures from The Book of Virtues" will air during prime time on PBS stations nationwide for three consecutive evenings, beginning on Labor Day, 1996. The series draws its themes from Dr. Bennett's collection of classic American stories, Greek mythology, European fairy tales, African fables, Asian folk tales, Native American legends and Bible stories.
<P>
The characters and stories in each adventure will exemplify the traits of good character and depict the virtues illustrated in the The Book of Virtues, which has sold over two million copies. Many well-known Hollywood stars will be lending their voices to the heroic characters and villains in the series.
<P>
William Bennett has been highly critical of network programs aimed at our nation's youth and believes that the way to respond to poor television programming is either to turn the television off or to try to put something on that will lift up spirits and minds. Dr. Bennett is hopeful that "Adventures from The Book of Virtues" will add some much needed lift to family viewing time.
<P>
<B>Call your local PBS outlet for viewing times on Labor Day.</B>

<FONT SIZE=5>Bennett: Educating America on Crime<BR>
</center>
</FONT>
<P>
<blockquote>
<FONT SIZE=2>Empower America's William Bennett was recently named
co-chair of the bipartisan Council on Crime in America. The commission
will present hard data to educate both the public and the media
on the nature and extent of the crime problem in the United States,
and identify policies and initiatives that protect citizens and
promote justice. Dr. Bennett co-chairs the Council on Crime with
Griffin B. Bell, who was Attorney General in the Carter Administration.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The Council on Crime's first report, The State of
Violent Crime in America, generated widespread media attention.
It revealed that despite the recent drop in crime rates in certain
cities, the dangers law-abiding citizens face are near an all-time
high. These dangers are compounded by the reality of &quot;revolving
door&quot; justice which allows criminals to walk free on probation,
parole or pre-trial release. In fact, one out of every three convicted</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2> criminals is under the &quot;supervision&quot; of
the justice system at the very time they commit more murders,
rapes and other violent crimes.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;This study paints a realistic and sobering
picture of violent crime in America,&quot; Bennett said, &quot;but
it is not without its rays of hope. If the success that cities
such as New York and Houston have had in reducing crime rates
teaches us anything, it is that the common sense of the American
people is right when it comes to crime: tough law enforcement
is a necessary part of the solution.&quot;<BR>

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Council's report also corrects some of the misinformation
about criminal justice spread by the popular press. For example,
the widespread myth that too many people are imprisoned in America
is refuted by the Council' s finding that only one criminal for
every 100 violent crimes actually goes to jail. Evidence that
over 90 percent of all state prisoners have been violent criminals
or are recidivists dispell inaccurate reports that prisons are
populated with nonviolent offenders. And the report presents calculations
which demonstrate that imprisoning violent offenders saves dollars
as well as lives: a single rape costs its victim and society an
average of $87,000 - many times greater than the cost of
keeping a rapist in prison for a year.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;This is an important report,&quot; Bennett
noted, &quot;it is rigorous, toughminded, and common-sensical.
It provides important information on the nature of the crime problem
in the United States. But more importantly, it points to the problems
in the American justice system that can be fixed, and if fixed,
can and will save lives. I am convinced that the first and fundamental
responsibility of government is protecting the citizenry. It is
the key provision in the social contract. And there is simply
no way that civil society can flourish if there is lawlessness
in the streets.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Council on Crime will be holding several grassroots
hearings across the nation over the next several months to highlight
innovative policies and citizen initiatives to counteract crime.
The final report, which will offer policy prescriptions to cut
crime, increase the effectiveness and responsiveness of the criminal
justice system, and promote citizen safety will be issued in the
summer of 1996.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Along with Bennett and Bell, other Council members
include Philadelphia District Attorney Lynne Abraham, former U.
S. Attorney General William Barr, Florida Attorney General Robert
Butterworth, Princeton Professor John DiIulio, California Prison
Commissioner John Gillis, Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith
and Colorado Attorney General Gail Norton. H</FONT>

<p>
<FONT SIZE=3>Kemp: Flatter, Fairer Tax System Urged<BR>
</FONT>
</center>
<P>
<blockquote>
<FONT SIZE=2>In January of 1996, the National Commission on Economic
Growth and Tax Reform issued a comprehensive report to Congress
and the country. Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole and House Speaker
Newt Gingrich created the Commssion last year to analyze the current
system and develop proposals for an entirely new tax system. Empower
America Co-Director Jack Kemp was appointed Chairman of the Commission.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The &quot;Kemp Commisson&quot; held hearings throughout
the country to learn the views of the American people about the
current tax system and their ideas for a new tax system. The Kemp
Commission found that the current tax code is far too complex,
intrusive and unfair, and is, in effect, a dead weight on the
American economy. As stated in the report, <i>Unleashing America's
Potential: A Pro-Growth, Pro-Family Tax System for the 21st Century:</i>
&quot;We believe the current tax code cannot be revised, should
not be reinvented, and must not be retained. Therefore, the commission
is unanimous: It is time to throw out the seven-million word mess
of tax laws and regulations and begin a new.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Commissioners outlined six working principles
they believe a tax code must have to ensure that the system is
fair while accurately reflecting and fostering the high ideals
of the American democratic-republic.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> These principles include: <i><b>fairness</b></i>, treating citizens
equally before the law;<i> <b>simplicity</b></i>; making compliance as easy as possible;
<b><i>neutrality</i></b>, so that people and not government make the choices;
<b><i>
stability</b></i>, so that people can accurately plan for their futures;
and <b><i>visibility</b></i>, so citizens will have an honest sense of the true
cost of government. The Commission also stressed that <b><i>economic
growth</i></b> must not be inhibited by the tax code.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>With these firm principles anchoring the Commission's
vision, it offered recommendations for a new tax system to stimulate
a vigorous national debate about how best to change the current
system. The Commission proposed a low, single-rate of taxation
with a generous personal exemption&Ntilde;to remove those people
least able to bear a tax burden from the tax rolls. Such a system
would remove the biases against work, saving, and investment present
in the current system's double, triple, and quadruple taxation
of income.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Another major recommendation was to make payroll
taxes fully deductible for working men and women. And it recommended
abolishing separate taxation of capital gains.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Addressing the current pattern of a constantly changing
tax code, the Commission also strongly recommended a 2/3 super
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2> majority vote in Congress be required to increase
tax rates in the future. This will provide a measure of stability
in the tax system so people and businesses can better plan future
savings and investment.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Secretary Kemp and other members of the Tax Reform
Commission recently testified before the Senate Finance Committee
where they outlined the very real and substantial problems with
the current system and strongly advocated the creation of a new
tax system for a new millennium, one that accomodates the new
information age and stimulates technological revolution.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Tax reform will be a key issue in the 1996 elections,
and many candidates have endorsed the single-rate model outlined
by the Kemp Commission. The dissatisfaction with the current code
is producing a groundswell of support for radical tax reform.
The Kemp Commission made a substantial contribution to this rising
tide of change by providing the philosophical justification for
a new, single-rate tax system for America's 21st century.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The fourteen Commissioners came from large and small
business sectors, academia, and the public sector. Empower America'
s Founding Chairman, Ted Forstmann, served as one of the Commissioners.

<FONT SIZE=3>Kirkpatrick: Facts on National Security<BR>
</FONT>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Empower America Co-Director and former US Ambassador
to the United Nations Jeane Kirkpatrick has taken issue with President
Bill Clinton's State of the Union (SOTU) assertion that his administration
has &quot;enhanced the security of the American people.&quot;
In a series of recent speeches and articles, Ambassador Kirkpatrick,
who is also a syndicated columnist, stated that &quot;almost everything
President Clinton said in his State of the Union address concerning
foreign policy is misleading, much simply untrue.&quot; Some major
national security issues which merit examination include:<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><b>National Missile Defense</b><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>President Clinton's statement that &quot;for the
first time, since the dawn of the nuclear age, there are no Russian
missiles pointed at American children&quot; is misleading, as
it ignores the overwhelming need to defend the United States from
attack by ballistic missiles carrying weapons of mass destruction.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The evidence that rogue regimes hostile to the United
States - such as Iraq, Iran and North Korea - are undertaking
extraordinary efforts to acquire advanced missile and weapons
technology is overwhelming. Two years ago, then-CIA Director James
Woolsey testified to the Congress, &quot;More than twenty-five
countries, many of them hostile to the United States and our friends
and allies, may now have or are developing nuclear, biological
and chemical weapons, and the means to deliver them.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>President Clinton vetoed the Defense Bill on December
29, 1995, in large part because he objected to the Congressional
increase in ballistic defense program funding and mandate to deploy
the defense system by 2003. In his veto message, Mr. Clinton argued
that deploying this defense system would violate the 1972 Antiballistic
Missile Treaty (ABM) between the United States and the former
Soviet Union. As EA Co-Directors Jeane Kirkpatrick and Jack Kemp
wrote to Senator Strom Thurmond (R-SC), Chairman of the Senate
Armed Services Committee, last fall: &quot;The ABM Treaty, designed
for a bipolar world, always had dubious value. It is now wholly
outdated .... It dismays us that instead of focusing on our current
needs, opponents of ballistic missile defense worry about outdated
arms control treaties with countries that no longer exist.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The development of missile defenses today is technologically
and economically feasible. We can speak and act with confidence
in the world only when we can defend ourselves.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It is interesting to note that public opinion polling
and focus groups indicate that most Americans are unaware that
the United States is unprotected from ballistic missile attack,
and believe this capability already exists. When they learn this
is not the case, they support national missile defense. President
Clinton did not mention the need to develop this defense capability
in his State of the Union speech. But as Ambassador Kirkpatrick
has said repeatedly, &quot;This is the most important issue in
defense policy for our times.&quot;<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><b>Bosnia</b><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>As a candidate for the presidency more than three
years ago, Bill Clinton pledged to use air strikes and lift the
arms embargo against the Bosnian Muslims so they could defend
themselves against Serb aggression. Instead, in recent testimony
before the National Security Committee of the House of Representatives,
Ambassador Kirkpatrick pointed out that &quot;more than two and
one half million have been displaced from their homes in this
war, more than 200,000 killed. Concentration camps, torture, mass
rape and mass murder have become familiar again in the region.&quot;
President Clinton's State of the Union assertion that &quot;we
stood for peace in Bosnia&quot; - while, as Ambassador
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2> Kirkpatrick wrote, &quot;prisoners starved, young
men died, war and refugees spread across the country - is
shameless.&quot; Had President Clinton kept his campaign promise
to help the victims of aggression defend themselves, 25,000 U.S.
troops may not have had to spend this past Christmas enforcing
a tenuous peace agreement in Bosnia.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><b>Clinton's Use of Force</b><BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>President Clinton said that he has kept our military
strong, and has used force &quot;only where we must.&quot; But
as Ambassador Kirkpatrick has written, &quot;In truth, the Clinton
administration has not used force only when it must.&quot; In
Bosnia, Somalia and Haiti, it used force when other policies would
have been equally or more effective, and the expressed goals for
these military interventions have not been achieved. &quot;A 'proud
nation' was not constructed in Somalia; 'democracy' was not restored
in Haiti; Bosnians were not protected from ethnic cleansing.&quot;
</FONT>
<p>
<FONT SIZE=2><b>
Neglecting Major Powers</b><BR> 
</FONT>
<p>
<FONT SIZE=2>Ambassador Kirkpatrick also cites the Clinton administration's
neglect of relations with major powers. &quot;Here,&quot; she
writes, &quot;there is a sad contrast to the Bush administration,
which focused on building and enhancing US relations with Western
Europe, Japan, China, Russia. All these relations have now deteriorated.
The President - off in pursuit of unconventional goals - is
neglecting the store.&quot; </FONT>

<FONT SIZE=3>EA Leads the Way at Freshman &quot;Advance&quot;

<blockquote>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Empower America and the Heritage Foundation recently
co-hosted the 1996 &quot;Congressional Advance&quot; for many
conservative freshman Members of the House of Representatives.
The Congressional Advance, held on January 25-26 in Baltimore,
marked the one-year anniversary of last year's Congressional Retreat,
which introduced the new conservative Members of Congress to Capitol
Hill. The Congressional Advance, like the Retreat, provided an
important forum to help the freshman Members plan the enactment
of a conservative agenda. Empower America CoDirector William Bennett
delivered the keynote address entitled &quot;The Republican Revolution:
The Next Steps.&quot; The conference also included panels on &quot;Government
Downsizing,&quot; &quot;Empowering Citizens,&quot; and &quot;Strengthening
America' s Families and Culture.&quot; More than fifty Members
of Congress attended the Advance, including several sophomore
Members of Congress.</FONT>

<FONT SIZE=3>Gallup Poll Finds Public Still Wants Tough Drug Control
Policy<BR>
</FONT>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2><i>According to a recent Gallup Poll, Americans still
view drug abuse as one of the most serious issues facing the country
in spite of decreasing public discussion by the media about the
&quot;war on drugs.&quot; Fully 94 percent of poll respondents
ranked the drug problem second only to violent crime. William
Bennett, former director of the Office of National Drug Control
Policy (&quot;Drug Czar&quot;) under President George Bush, was
invited by the Gallup organization to review the polling results
and comment on their implications for public policy. His remarks follow.</i>
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<center><FONT SIZE=2>Statement by</FONT><br>
<FONT SIZE=2>WILLIAM J. BENNETT</FONT><br>
<FONT SIZE=2>to accompany the release of the Gallup Poll</FONT><br>
<FONT SIZE=2>A 1996 VIEW OF THE DRUG PROBLEM IN AMERICA</FONT><br>
<FONT SIZE=2>December 12, 1995<BR>
</FONT>
</center>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Toward the close of my tenure as Secretary of Education,
in a speech before the White House Conference on a Drug-Free 
America, I called for a &quot;transformation of government
policy to match, and build on, the transformation of public sentiment.&quot;
I was referring to the public' s recognition that drug use was
no longer considered harmless fun or mere self-indulgence, but
a personal, medical and economic catastrophe. That was in 1988,
and indeed we did continue to mount a strong offensive against
drugs throughout the Bush administration from 1989 to 1992 - with
real results. Since 1993, America has in large part abandoned
the drug war. But public sentiment, as this Gallup Poll attests,
has not changed. Americans still want a tough and decisive
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2> drug control policy with the federal government rightfully
leading the fight.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>It is no surprise that Gallup found more than nine
in ten Americans seriously concerned about drug abuse, and that
the issue of drugs rates second only to violent crime in seriousness.
Americans should be concerned, because the news is bad; drug use
among adolescents is once again on the rise after the steady and
dramatic decline of the 1980s and early 1990s. According to the
Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University,
&quot;the jump in marijuana use among children 12 to 18 years...signals
that 820,000 more of these children will try cocaine in their
lifetime. Of that number, about
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2> 58,000 will become regular cocaine users and addicts.&quot;
More bad news is that drug related hospital emergency-room cases -
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2> dominated by aging, inner-city drug addicts - have
reached the highest levels since 1978. Cocaine, heroin and marijuana
cases all have increased sharply to record levels.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>What Americans have witnessed - and reacted
to in the Gallup Poll - is the result of a failure of public
policy brought about by a moral torpor on the drug issue. Policy
follows attitude. But the public' s attitude is not one of indifference
toward the scourge. When asked what they wanted to see <i>a lot more</i>
of, more than half of the Gallup respondents cited strict law
enforcement and education of the young, and <i>two-thirds</i> cited reduction
of the supply of drugs coming into the United States. By contrast,
<i>fewer than 
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>half</i> - 43 percent - asked for more treatment
programs.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The current policy of &quot;treatment on demand&quot;
presents a record of failure that is reflected in the weak support
it received in the Gallup Poll. Unlike the effective and modest
treatment programs sponsored by churches and using variants of
the 12-step method, thc government treatment bureaucracy is manifestly
wasteful and ineffective. From 1988 to 1994, federal drug treatment
spending almost tripled while the estimated number of treatment
slots actually declined. And the discouraging result is that overall
cocaine treatment is not significantly reducing the population
of hard core addicts. We must 
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>turn our support toward the proven models of treatment,
while recognizing the harsh realities of cocaine and crack addiction
as yet one more compelling reason why preventing casual drug use
by the young - the first step on the path to addiction - is
so important.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Gallup Poll respondents put drug interdiction high
on their list - the percentage of those calling for increased
efforts to reduce the incoming supply of drugs into the U.S. was
88 percent. Those respondents are right - the government
should put the U.S. military in charge of stopping the flow of
illegal drugs from outside our borders and give the military control
over the entire interdiction</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2> process. We know that strong interdiction works.
In 1989, the U.S. military followed Columbia's internal crack-down
on the cocaine cartels with the most extensive detection, tracking
and interdiction effort ever mounted against cocaine transit from
the Andean countries north. These events 
produced substantial disruption in the cocaine supply
to the U.S. between 1989 and 1991. Drugs were less available on
the streets; cocaine-related emergency room cases declined; reported
cocaine deaths decreased; the estimated number of heavy users
fell; and casual use dropped dramatically. Today, U.S. foreign
policy no longer takes the drug problem seriously, and the once strong
military interdiction role has been abdicated. We need now to
restore our interdiction efforts and to establish trade and diplomatic
sanctions and eliminate aid to cocaine source countries that fail
to reduce their production of cocaine.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>More law enforcement efforts to punish and convict
people for the use 
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>and sale of illegal drugs were endorsed by 83 percent
of the Gallup respondents. Even more forcefully, by 85 percent,
those surveyed rejected the despairing proposal that drugs should
be legalized in America. The response is wise on both counts.
Law enforcement requires action at the federal, state and local
levels. The federal role requires 
the identification and dismantling of all major drug
trafficking organizations known to be operating in the U.S. Law
enforcement, drug treatment, and prevention education are state
and local responsibilities for which current federal aid should
be block granted without mandates.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The majority of respondents (85 percent) who oppose
legalization of drugs send a strong message to those who would
propose such an option. Drugs like heroin and cocaine are not
dangerous and threatening to society because they are illegal.
They are illegal because they are dangerous and threatening to
American society. Any relaxation 
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>in standards of illegality would make drugs more
accessible, cheaper and morally permissible. On this issue there
has long been a great gap between a select few who favor legalization - and
the overwhelming body of the American people who reject such a
policy of despair. In the Gallup Poll, the people have again made
that point.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Success in the drug war depends above all on what
happens in America' s homes, classrooms, churches, voluntary associations,
television and movie screens, city streets and civic halls. It
depends on the efforts of parents, teachers, clergy, police chiefs,
judges and community leaders. When I was President Bush' s &quot;drug
czar,&quot; I visited more than 100 cities. I made a point to
go where the problem was the worst and to visit and learn from
the people who made things better. I saw extraordinary actions
and extraordinary achievements. The point is, we know what works.
The common denominators are almost always the same: civic concern,
moral seriousness, and toughminded and intelligent policies.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Gallup organization has given us <i>A 1996 View
of The Drug Problem in America</i>. That view clearly shows that the
American people also understand what needs to be done and are
ready to renew the fight.</font>

<FONT SIZE=3>EA to Host Spring Candidate School<BR>
</FONT>
<P>

<blockquote>
<FONT SIZE=2>Building on the success of EA's efforts in 1994 to
inform candidates for office about Empower America's political
message, EA Co-Directors Jack Kemp, William Bennett, and Jeane
Kirkpatrick invite 1996 candidates to join them in Washington,
DC on Monday, April 29 for Empower America's 1996 Candidate School.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Educating candidates for local, state and national
office is one of EA's most important functions. While most candidate
schools concentrate on the nuts and bolts of running for office,
Empower America's training is devoted entirely to a discussion
of issues and their philosophical and political foundations. The
EA messages of economic opportunity, cultural renewal and international
leadership are stressed.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>During the day-long event, a variety of political
instructors will address the attendees:
individual leaders, policy experts, political
analysts and elected officials. EA will bring together the best
thinkers and the best ideas to help each candidate form a solid
base of information and craft a winning message. Another valuable
component of the sessions is to learn from participating candidates
about issues and concerns being raised by citizens in their districts.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>As in 1994, Empower America will prepare a detailed
candidate briefing book for all participants, and will make the
book available to candidates who are unable to attend.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In 1994 Empower America worked with candidates for
office ranging from local school boards to the U.S. Senate. &quot;Graduates&quot;
include some of the leading &quot;revolutionaries&quot; of the
104th Congress - Congressmen Joe Scarborough (FL), Bob Barr
(GA), Ron Lewis (KY), Dick Chrysler (MI), Phil English (PA) and
Senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee. Jack Kemp, William Bennett
and Jean Kirkpatrick look forward to exchanging ideas with the
1996 candidates who want to become better informed about Empower
America' s policy agendas.<BR>

<p>
<FONT SIZE=3>Campaign Tackles Trash TVTalk Shows<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=3>Ads aimed at shows' advertisers having effect<BR>
</FONT>
</center>
<blockquote>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>For the past several months, Empower America Co-director
William Bennett has been involved in a public campaign with Senators
Joe Lieberman (D-CT) and Sam Nunn (D-GA) to focus scrutiny on
certain 
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>daytime television talk shows. The campaign has resonated
strongly with the American people, many of whom have contacted
Empower America to express their relief that someone has finally
given voice to the concerns they have about the filth paraded
on television.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Consider the subjects discussed on a number of talk
shows during the past year, according to <i>Electronic Media </i>(April, 1995):
a l3 year old discussing her sexual experiences which began when
she was 10; a male guest admitting to sleeping with his girlfriend's
mother; a woman claiming to have been impregnated while making
a 
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>pornographic movie; or the following titles: &quot;Sex
Caught on Tape,&quot; and &quot;I'm Marrying a 14-year Old Boy.&quot;
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Clearly, shows such as these cross the line of decency.
They celebrate the perverse, and they normalize trashy behavior.
The campaign against trash television is based on the premise
that companies should stop their support of this kind of demeaning,
degrading content. And if they continue their support, they should
be able to justify publicly what they are doing.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The campaign has had a number of different components.
Dr. Bennett and Senator Lieberman have written letters to the
heads of major corporations - Sony, Tribune, Time Warner,
National Amusements, King World, Gannett - which own the
companies that produce the shows, asking them to reconsider their
support of trash television, and questioning whether profits these
companies derive from such degrading, valueless products are really
worth it.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>In addition, advertisers have been targeted
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>for their support of trash talk television.
On December 7, Dr. Bennett, Senators Lieberman and Nunn unveiled
a television ad calling on major advertisers to stop sponsoring
cultural rot, and asking them to reconsider
their support of these programs. There are
indications that some of them already have: Sears Roebuck, Unilever
NV, Procter &amp; Gamble, and Mars Inc. have said they are withdrawing
advertising from some of these programs.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>And on January 22, Dr. Bennett, Senators Lieberman
and Nunn called on the owners of local stations to use their influence
to take the trash out of talk TV, with an open letter that ran
in the daily newsletter of the annual conference of the National
Association of Television Program Executives (NATPE).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Since the campaign began, we've had evidence from
a number of quarters that the tide is turning. Not only have some
advertisers pulled out, but a number of shows have been canceled.
Several station managers in 
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>California and in Colorado have decided to discontinue
airing shows they deem unacceptable. And a January poll by <i>Broadcasting
&amp; Cable</i> of TV general managers shows that 83 percent agree
that talk shows are purveyors of &quot;sleazy, tasteless subject
matter with little if any redeeming value.&quot; And the new shows
being offered up for next year focus less on sensationalism.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Viewers also have a responsibility. Instead of simply
lamenting the debased state of our popular culture, citizens need
to take action. While turning off these shows, or requesting companies
to 
</FONT>
<FONT SIZE=2>stop producing this kind of material won't eradicate
all of the garbage on our television screens, it will make an
important step toward relegating this trash to the sidelines,
and out of the mainstream. And so the campaign continues to petition
men and women of good will - viewers, sponsors, producers - to
do something about it. </FONT>

as a virtue. And it used to be the fact that if you had failures

<FONT SIZE=2>&quot;We laid out a philosophical framework for revising
the tax code for the twenty-first century. And we suggested quite
specifically that the tax rate should be a single rate with a

a woman or man would face as they take the first two or three
rungs in the ladder. And we came out specifically for the deduction
of the payroll tax, which is a huge burden on working men and

<P>
</center>
<blockquote>
<FONT SIZE=2>Empower America is making an impact! In this important
political year, when American citizens and candidates will be
participating in the long process which will culminate in the
selection of America's president and Congress, Empower America's
ideas and issues have become an essential part of the debate.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Whether the issue is a flatter, fairer tax; crime,
drugs and television trash talk shows; or U.S. military forces
in Bosnia and the need for national missile defense - Empower
America's ideas are shaping the agenda. We urge Empower America
Associates to get even more involved in the days ahead. There
is so much to be done, and each of you has an important role to
play.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Re-ordering the size and scope of government in our
nation and in our lives is an immense project. By attending your
local town meetings, writing letters to your elected representatives
and the editor of your local newspaper, calling in on radio talk
shows, meeting with your neighbors and discussing the issues,
you can make sure that your concerns and your ideas are heard.
And by doing so, you demonstrate the most fundamental tenet of
our shared beliefs: that individual citizens, not government,
are responsible for setting the nation's priorities and deciding
how best they are met.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>We have never been better positioned to make a difference.
In January 1996, Empower America celebrated its third birthday.
In this short time, we have established an organization unlike
any in Washington today. The energy, commitment and involvement
of Empower America's Co-Directors and grassroots Associates have
made us a formidable team. Like you, Bill Bennett, Jack Kemp and
Jeane Kirkpatnck share a positive vision of America's future.
Our shared belief in economic growth and opportunity, social and
cultural renewal, and strong international leadership can lead
a vibrant Amenca into the twenty-first century and the information
age.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Your continued involvement and commitment are essential.
and we are grateful for your support and activism.<BR>

VOL. 3 NO. 2, FALL 1995 
<P>
<H3>"Beyond the Contract: The Next Steps"</H3>
Speech by Rep. Newt Gingrich, Speaker of the House
</CENTER>
<p>
MAY 9,1995, WASHINGTON, DC-- This is V-E Day, and there is a parallel about which we need to be aware. Franklin Roosevelt said in 1936 that our generation has a rendezvous with destiny. He was referring to dealing with Italy, Japan and Germany. That generation ultimately, reluctantly, rose to that challenge, driven in part by Pearl Harbor, and ultimately succeeded.
<p>
We then had a rendezvous with destiny in containing the Soviet empire until it collapsed. For 45 years we did that. We led the largest worldwide coalition in history, and we sustained forces against the Soviet empire far longer than anybody thought a democracy could. So we've won two enormous victories on the world scene in the last two generations.
<p>
The surprising thing, I think, is that our current rendezvous with destiny is here at home. We have to renew American civilization because if it continues to decay, we will literally be incapable of being effectivein the world and the world market.
<p>
The situation is very grave. It is obvious to all of you if you watch any local television news anywhere in the country, that we have a level of violence, a level of decay, a level of brutality which is not sustainable in a free society. I've often said that you can't maintain civilization with 12-year-olds having babies, with 15-yearolds killing each other, with 17-year-olds dying of AIDS, with 18-yearolds getting diplomas they can't even read. And all four of those things are happening in our country.
<p>
There is much more to do. For starters, we will be building on the success of the Contract. We adopted the Contract last summer and fall. We stood on the Capitol steps in September and introduced it to the American people; then we based our campaigns on it. We ran a TV Guide ad that had no negatives, no attack on Bill Clinton and no antiDemocratic rhetoric. It just said, "Give us a chance, here's what we'll do," and outlined the Contract With America. We then got elected.
<p>
Starting the opening day, we kept our word. We passed nine reforms in a 14 hour opening day--the longest in United States history. We continued keeping our word. We brought up every item we said we would. We passed 30 out of 31 items. The only legislative item we lost from the Contract was term limits, where we got 85 percent voting "yes" from the Republican side, 82 percent voting "no" on the Democratic side, and because term limits require a Constitutional majority of 290, we couldn't get it to pass. In the first 93 days, we had a total of 302 recorded votes.
<p>
We're now looking at "where do we go from here?" I think the answer lies in three large projects at the vision level, and then, nine strategies. Let me very briefly run through these visions and strategies:
<p>
We have three major things we have to do. We've got to communicate to the American people that there is an American future that's better--better economic growth, better technology, better services, better opportunities, better safety--and we want to work with the American people to get to that better future.
<p>
Second, we have to have a dialogue. I think it's very important for us to go beyond just debating liberals. We have to have a dialogue with the American people. We have to get people engaged and talking about their future.
<p>
Out of that new vision of a successful America, and new dialogue with the American people, we want to establish a new partnership. Remember, this is not government-to-citizen, this is citizentocitizen. The Constitution begins, "We, the people of the United States," and what we've got to do is go back and reestablish that as a reality in everyone's life.
<p>
I also believe that if our children are going to compete in the world market they have to do a whole lot more homework than they've been doing. My guess is they've got to do probably two hours a night. I think we literally cheat them if they don't have enough homework to learn how to study, to acquire the information they must have in order to compete with Germany, Japan and China. However, I do not suggest that that means we need a "Federal Department of Homework Checkers." Instead, we need to reestablish a partnership where we expect parents to care about their children's education, and we make that a standard and a routine expectation.
<p>
This is why I believe that what we're doing is as much a cultural change as it is a political change. We are reasserting the core of American civilization. The road there is made up of nine strategies.
<p>
First, we have to renew American civilization. That means reasserting the work ethic, family, savings--all the core values that started with the notion that we're endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights. Remember that is the most radical statement of human rights in history--that power comes from God to you, and then you loan it to the government. The power doesn't come from God to the government.
<p>
Second, we need to be competitive in the world market. We get high economic growth by reestablishing a system in which entrepreneurs are encouraged to go out and compete, in which there are enough savings, and in which we're prepared to create American jobs through world sales. To do that we have to rethink litigation, regulation, taxation, education, the welfare system, and the bureaucratic structure of government, because we are not a competitive society today. If we want our children to have the best jobs on the planet with the highest take-home pay, it's going to take real effort.
<p>
Third, we have to accelerate moving into the information age. The fact is there are extraordinary opportunities out there, and we are doing too little to take advantage of them.
<p>
The fourth strategic change we need is to replace the welfare state with the opportunity society. We can design a volunteercentered, spiritually-centered replacement for the welfare state that dramatically improves the life of the poor. Every time you hear a liberal jump up to defend the current-system, just remember that what they're telling you is that they are prepared to use the children as the device to keep the bureaucracy. It is inexcusable what we do to poor children in the inner city. We have to replace the welfare state with an opportunity society.
<p>
Fifth, we have to decentralize power and disperse power. They are two different things. Decentralization gets it out of Washington; dispersing it gets it back to you. Ultimately, block grants are, in my mind, a first step toward a dramatic degovernmentalizing of America. One of the reasons we were so strongly for the $500 child tax credit was to make the flat assertion: "parents who earn it have a higher claim than bureaucrats who want to spend it," and that we want the money to stay with the parents, not go to a bureaucracy. That's a very different model of how you organize America.
<p>
Sixth, for the parts of government that we do keep, I think they should be the best in the world. I think our principle ought to be that if you're going to have a federal government it ought to be excellent. I am not anti-government. I think we need a lean, effective government. What we have today is a big, fat, sloppy, ineffective and weak government, incapable of setting priorities and incapable of doing well the things government should focus on.
<p>
Seventh, we should balance the budget. It is a practical matter, and I can give you the simple moral test. For most of American history we paid off the family mortgage and we left the children the farm. In this generation, we're gradually selling off the farm and leaving the children the mortgage. A child born this year will pay $187,000 in taxes in their lifetime, just to pay interest on the federal debt, that is $3,500 per working year just to pay interest. Interest on the debt will be larger than the cost of national security in 1997. That gives you some sense of scale. More and more, your taxes will go to pay interest to the bond-holders than will go to pay for the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, intelligence agencies, and defense bureaucracies combined. Now, that is not sustainable, which is why I think we do have a profound challenge to balance the budget.
<p>
In addition, Medicare has its own freestanding problems. The Clinton Administration's Medicare Trustees reported that Medicare literally runs out of money by 2002. And when you look further into the future to when the baby boomers retire, it's dramatically worse. We have the challenge to be prepared to implement the reforms that are necessary to save Medicare now, and then to have a commission which will look at how you save Medicare in the baby boom years, which is a massively bigger challenge than trying to save it now.
<p>
Eighth, I think we have to have a strategy of safety for the American people. If your government can't protect you, then you have no constitutional liberties. We have an obligation to reassert and reestablish the legitimate right of every citizen, that they ought to be able to live without fear in a safe country which loves its children enough to protect them from the predators who right now dominate all too many of our streets.
<p>
Lastly, we have to have a strategy for leading the planet. We are the only country large enough, complex enough and strong enough to lead the human race. If in fact we allow our culture to collapse and our economy to decay, there is nobody who can replace us. If we can't do the first eight things in order to set ourselves up to be able to lead, and we collapse as leaders, you will in fact, I think, leave your children a dark and bloody planet. In that sense I think Chechnya and Bosnia, Rwanda and Somalia are harbingers of the kind of future that could come if America grows weaker.
<p>
I think over the last couple of years that Empower America has been a very helpful part of this. I think that it really has given us a range of ideas. There is a whole series of things we've done over the last couple of years that I think have been very, very helpful. We can continue building this momentum; we need as many voices and as many systems out there as we can get that are educating, encouraging, and pushing in the same general direction. And so I appreciate very, very much the chance to be here with you today, and I thank you all very much for coming.

<P>
<H3>Empower America's Victory Against Time Warner</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
Empower America has scored an important victory on the cultural front. For the past several months, William J. Bennett, Co-director of Empower America, and C. DeLores Tucker, Chair of the National Political Congress of Black Women, have been involved in a public campaign against offensive and misogynistic music Iyrics. They have targeted their efforts on Time Warner, one of the greatest perpetrators of this kind of cultural filth. This spring, Time Warner increased its investment in "gangsta rap" by expanding its stake to 50 percent of Interscope Records, the label behind such artists as Snoop Doggy Dogg, Dr. Dre, Nine Inch Nails, and Tupac Shakur. Such "artists" extol the rape, murder, and torture of women. Some of these Iyrics glorify sexual abuse and even celebrate the murder of police officers. Columnist John Leo called Time Warner's investment "the cultural equivalent of owning half the world's mustard gas factories."
<p>
As a result, Bennett and Tucker called on Time Warner's sense of corporate responsibility and citizenship to end their sDonsorshiD of such music. They asked Time Warner to stop producing music which was unworthy of human consumption or corporate support.
<p>
In May, Bennett and Tucker met with Time Warner executives to present their case. At that time, their appeal fell on deaf ears. Bennett and Tucker then expanded their efforts to include a television ad, press conferences in New York and Los Angeles, as well as radio and television programs. In addition, Dr. Bennett wrote to Gerald Levin, Chairman and CEO of Time Warner, and both Tucker and Bennett wrote letters to members of the Board of Directors of Time Warner, informing them of the kind of music Time Warner was involved in producing and distributing. In June, Senator Joseph Lieberman (D-CT) joined Tucker and Bennett in a radio ad and press conference calling on Time Warner to exercise corporate responsibility.
<p>
The campaign has had strong resonance with the American public. The New York Times, The Wall Street Joumal, The Los Angeles Times, The Washington Post, Time, and Newsweek have all covered the story. Political figures from both parties, including President Clinton, and Bob Dole, the Senate majority leader, have voiced their support for Empower America's efforts.
<p>
On September 27, Time Warner announced that it planned to sever its ties with Interscope Records, selling its 50% stake back to Interscope founders Ted Field and Jimmy Lovine--an indication that shame and a call to corporate responsibility do work. Dr. Bennett applauded Time Warner's decision, and said that the company was "acting like a leader" in its decision to sell Interscope. Said Bennett, "I congratulate them, they did the right thing. I hope this is a statement about a larger point--that there are some things so bad that no responsible company will market and sell them to our children."
<p>
Empower America will continue to monitor the fate of Interscope, to see which music company, if any decides to purchase it. If other major companies pick up Interscope, they will hear from us. We will continue to press our case against corporations which peddle filth as entertainment for children.

<H3>EA Letter To Our Readers</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
The level of change effected in the first session of the 104th Congress has been unprecedented. Members passed more bills and worked more hours than during any previous congress. The battle over the size of the federal budget and the scale of Washington's bureaucracy is being won by those who would cut the size and scope of government.
<p>
This coongress accomplished policy goals that the cynics and skeptics dismissed as impossible. Nine of the ten components of "The Contract with America" passed the House of Representatives during the first hundred days of the 104th Congress and were sent to the Senate for consideration. Many of those measures have now passed the
<p>
Senate, while others continue to move through the legislative process under the guidance of those who understand the rightful limits of federal power.
<p>
The majority of members elected in November, especially those serving their first term, are committed to the empowerment agenda. They believe that individuals --not the federal government--should make the choices that affect their own lives. They know that high taxes hurt families and businesses at all income levels.
<p>
We have many friends in Congress, but we must remain active. This puts us in a position to get things done. We are working with individuals who understand the ideas that are important to us and who can act to promote them.<p>

Continue to write your representatives in Congress. Attend local town meetings and other events that allow you to meet with your representatives and articulate your views on national issues. This focal point of American politics allows you to become active in the governing process at the grassroots level.
<p>
We greatly appreciate your continued support and activism.
<P>
Charles Kupperman

<H3>Empower America On The Hill</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
Empower America's Co-directors and board members have-been busy and active with the new Congress. We have been working with the Congressional leadership since January of 1993 to advocate the principles we represent. The new 104th Congress has provided us with a heightened opportunity to work for change. Our Co-directors and board members have tes fied before numerous Congressional committees promoting the empowerment agenda. Following are some highlights from the testimonies of Jeanne Kirkpatrick, William Bennett, and Jack Kemp.
<p>
<b>Jeanne Kirkpatrick:</b>
<p>
Empower America Co-director Jeane Kirkpatrick spoke to the House Foreign Relations Committee on January 24, 1995 about "National Security and International Affairs in the Context of Cooperation and Limitation." She was one of the select foreign policy experts chosen to give remarks on stability and instability in the international arena, and policy directives America should pursue.
<p>
Dr. Kirkpatrick said, "I believe this Congress and the National Security Revitalization Act have arrived just in the nick of time. Our military forces are beginning to 'go hollow,' and are feeling the full impact of schedules and budgets which have left them over-deployed and undertrained, overworked and underpaid."
<p>
<b>William Bennett:</b>
<p>
Empower America Co-director William Bennett testified several times before the new Congress. Of particular interest were his remarks to the United States Senate Budget Committee on January 24, 1995. His testimony was in regard to the topic, "Governing in the 21st Century." The new Congress has the opportunity to change the role and enormous size of the federal government, which Dr. Bennett strongly advocates in part through a "radical devolution" of decision-making.
<p>
Dr. Bennett told the committee, ":..it is critical to take a step back and establish once again a clear delineation of government's role. We need to articulate once again the proper responsibilities and limits of government--things like providing for the defense of the nation, waging war, building infrastructure projects, administering transfer payments, keeping the streets safe, and the like."
<p>
<b>Jack Kemp:</b>
<p>
Jack Kemp testified before the Senate Small Business Committee on October 19th in support of Senators Abraham and Lieberman's enterprise zone bill. The bill, entitled "The Enhanced Enterprise Zone Act of 1995," is closely patterned after Kemp's -bill from the 80's.
<p>
i In his testimony, Kemp pointed out, "How can we possibly begin to address the problems of crime, drugs, and education without first recognizing that without jobs and opportunity, there is little hope and few reasons to graduate from school, stay off drugs, and resist the underground economy? Without the expectation that there is a good job waiting out of college or high school, there will be no link between effort and reward, and no way to address fully the social pathologies that are all too prevalent in our inner cities."
<p>
Kemp went on to say that "over the past several years, the federal government has created an economic climate in America that is indifferent at best, and hostile at worst, to the agents of economic growth. Washington now imposes a vast array of income taxes, corporate taxes, payroll taxes, regulations, and mandated benefits that encourage businesses to keep employees to an absolute minimum. Today, the combined tax and regulatory burden on risktaking-- the process by which new enterprises and jobs are created-- has climbed to the levels of the early 1980s."

<H3>Kemp Heads National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
Empower America Co-director Jack Kemp was chosen to chair the newly formed <a href="http://www.townhall.com/taxcom/">National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform</a>. Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole and Speaker of the House of Representatives Newt Gingrich appointed Kemp to lead the eight member commission in proposing a new economic pratform.
<p>
The goals of the new commission are ambitious and sweeping. Senator Dole charged the commission with moving "beyond tax reform toward a complete overhaul of the entire tax system." He added, "that's why we have asked Jack to reexamine the entire 4,000 page federal tax code... to start with a blank piece of paper." Kemp promised that the commission will focus on "reforming our tax code, restoring incentives to entrepreneurial capitalism, lowering tax rates, helping create jobs, and assisting low-income persons escape the conditions of poverty and welfare dependency."
<p>
In this effort, the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform will design, and push for the passage of, an alternative tax system that is fairer, flatter, and simpler. Speaker Gingrich noted that Kemp and the commission will "reach out to all of the presidential candidates, to all of the Republican governors, to all of the members of the House and Senate, to corporate America, and to the American people to put together the kind of reforms that are vital."
<p>
Both Dole and Gingrich asserted that naming Kemp to chair the commission carried both symbolic and practical significance. Speaker Gingrich asserted that "it is clear that there is a yearning in America for a very profound rethinking of the tax code, and Jack Kemp is the one to provide that type of leadership, having given President Reagan the Kemp-Roth tax cut of 1981." Dole added, "For over two decades Jack has been one of our most innovative thinkers on economic policy. No one can speak to these issues more creatively and more credibly."
<p>
The commission will issue a final report at the end of 1995--in time for the 1996 presidential primaries.

<H3>A Fairer, Simpler 21st Century Single Tax Rate System</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
Recent polling shows almost twothirds of all Americans are interested in replacing the current income tax system with a single rate tax system which would require all American citizens and businesses to pay one, simple, low tax rate--around 17 percent.
<p>
Today, American economic policy is a mess. The tax code is now more than 5 million words long, understood by few, and oppressive to all. Washington's 60,000 pages of federal regulations further stifle entrepreneurial spirit while government spending remains out of control. The bottom line is lethargic economic growth and the loss of opportunity for millions of Americans.
<p>
The tax increases in the budget acts of 1990 and 1993 reversed the trend toward lower tax rates and fewer federal regulations that spurred the unprecedented growth and job creation of the 1980s. To put the tax code in perspective, it is worthwhile to look at how much the average family of four pays in taxes. In 1950, the typical middleincome family paid about 2 percent of its income in federal taxes. By 1993, that amount had increased to about 24 percent of income.
<p>
The only thing more costly to America than its tax system is its system of federal regulations. Experts estimate that these regulations cost Americans nearly $1 trillion a year.
<p>
The U.S. spends more money on its federal government than all other countries, except Japan, spend on their entire economies. In 1950, federal spending was about 16 percent of total gross domestic output. Today it has ballooned to 23 percent of GDP.
<p>
Taxes, regulations, and spending have produced an economy with anemic growth, slow job creation, and hindered entrepreneurship, and one in which the American Dream is not yet secure for enough of our people. Since the current economic recovery began, GDP growth has averaged just 2.4 percent in real terms, less than half the 5 percent growth rate usually associated with recoveries.
<p>
Job creation has lagged even further behind, increasing by only 3 percent instead of the average 9 percent recovery.
<p>
There is a straightforward way to deal with taxes, regulations, and spending-- the single rate tax system. The need to address all of these concerns is precisely what has piqued the American public's and Congress' interest in this revolutionary idea.

<H3>EA Brochure Lets You Make Federal Budget Cuts</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
Washington, DC--Empower America Co-director Jack Kemp, along with Rep. Steve Largent (R-OK) and other members of the House Budget Committee, unveiled Empower America's new brochure on the budget process, entitled "Your Turn to Balance the Federal Budget."
<p>
Described by Largent as "a great way for people to become better informed about the budget process and to see for themselves what it is like to balance the budget," the brochure includes a worksheet which outlines current budgetary expenditures. Readers are also invited to enter their own numbers in an effort to develop a balanced budget reflecting their priorities.
<p>
Both the House and Senate have passed plans that would bring the federal budget into balance over a seven-year period, by slowing the rate of growth in many federal programss and targeting many others for elimination--those that are outdated or duplicative.
<p>
The share of the federal debt held by every man woman and child today totals over $18,500. Without fundamental change, children born today will pay nearly $200,000 over their lifetime in taxes to sustain the interest on the debt, and face a total tax rate (for all local, state, and federal spending) of 84 percent of their earnings over their lifetime, according to calculations in President Clinton's own budget.
<p>
Once the federal budget is balanced, for the first time since 1969, the government will be able to pay off its debt, which has grown over the 219 years of our history to nearly $5 trillion this year.
<p>
If you are interested in receiving your own copy of Empower America' s brochure, "Your Turn to Balance the Federal Budget," to discover how the process works, and make your own choices, then please send your request to Empower America at 1776 I Street, NW, Suite 890, Washington, DC 20006.

<H3>EA Leadership Council's Conference Forum</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
Empower America's Leadership Council held its second Conference Forum in early May. One hundred members attended the day and a half conference set against the backdrop of our nation's capitol. Focusing on the state of the 104th Congress, "The Contract with America," and the future of our government, the conference's main objectives were to inform, enlighten, and empower its participants.
<p>
Empower America Co-director Jeane Kirkpatrick kicked off the formal program with a dinner address titled, "Beyond the Contract: Foreign and Domestic." In her remarks, Ambassador Kirkpatrick outlined the position that the United States government has taken on several foreign policy issues, her thoughts on those policies, the future of our government, and the changes that are necessary to ensure maximum peace and protection for the world.
<p>
The next day was packed with various speeches and discussions. Breakfast keynote speaker Co-director Bill Bennett remarked on the cultural impact of "The Contract with America," as well as giving his thoughts on the upcoming presidential election. Following Dr. Bennett, Senators Connie Mack (R-FL) and John Ashcroft (R-MO), and Congressmen John Boehner (R-OH) and Chris Cox (R-CA) shared their experiences and insight on the phenomenal first one hundred days of the Senate and House. 
<p>Two freshmen members of the House, Sue Myrick (R-NC) and Sam Brownback (R-KS), spoke about being part of a freshman class which retains the same hope and enthusiasm that they had when the 104th session of Congress began. Perhaps the most anticipated speaker of the day was the Speaker of the House and Empower America Board Member, Newt Gingrich. Speaker Gingrich, introduced by Co-director Jack Kemp, eloquently argued that "our rendezvous with destiny is here at home." He illustrated this point with his three vision levels and nine strategies for Congress to follow up 'The Contract with America."
<p>
The sessions and speeches successfully wrapped up with an inside look at the work of pollsters and their influence on elections. As the day drew to a close, Council Members were invited for a private tour of the Capitol.

<H3>Empower America Pushes the Single Rate Tax System In New Hampshire</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
Empower America continued its ad campaign advocating a low, single rate tax system by running radio spots in New Hampshire. Since the 1996 presidential race begins in New Hampshire, Empower America wanted to produce a radio spot that would influence the debate on the single rate system. William Bennett, Jack Kemp, Jeane Kirkpatrick, and Vin Weber have been strong proponents of a low single rate, and hope their efforts will influence the 104th Congress, and the presidential hopefuls.
<p>
William Bennett was the voice behind the message Empower America sent to the people of New Hampshire. The 60 second radio ad ran 88 times on five news and talk radio stations in New Hampshire.

<H3>Empower America Launches Campaign
Against Daytime TV Talk Shows</H3>
<i>Statement by William J. Bennett 
<br> October 26, 1995</i></CENTER>
<p>
First, I want to express my thanks to Senator Joe Lieberman. Senator Lieberman is the father of this idea. It was his suggestion that we continue to bring pressure--public pressure--on the perpetrators of cultural rot by calling attention to these shows.
<p>
Earlier this year, Senator Lieberman joined C. DeLores Tucker of the National Political Congress of Black Women and me in our campaign to urge Time Warner to sell their stake in Interscope Records, Inc. Today, we turn our attention to television. Now these days there is a lot of criticism directed at television--the casual cruelty, the rampant promiscuity, the mindlessness of sit-coms and soap operas. Most of the criticisms are justified. But this is not the worst of it. The worst of television is the day-time television talk shows we have identified. In these shows, indecent exposure is celebrated as a virtue.
<p>
It is hard to remember now, but there was once a time when personal or marital failure, subliminal desires, and perverse taste were accompanied by guilt or embarrassment. But today, these conditions are a ticket to appear as a guest on the Sally Jessy Raphael show, the Ricki Lake show, the Jerry Springer show, or one of the dozen or so like them.
<p>
I asked my staff to provide me with a list of some of the shows of some recent day-time talk-show topics. The list included "A Mother Who Ran Off with Her Daughter's Fiance," "Women Who Marry Their Rapists," "I'm Marrying a 14-year-old Boy," a woman who claims she got pregnant while making a pornographic movie; a 13-year-old guest who was urged to share her sexual experiences which began when she was 10; a woman eight months pregnant who boasted of having eight sexual partners during her first two trimesters; a 17-year-old girl who boasted of having slept with over a hundred men--well, you get the idea.

<p>
It is important here to point out who we are not talking about. We are not talking about shows like Oprah, or Regis and Kathie Lee. The shows which are the object of our criticisms are not close calls; they go way over the line of decency. They are at the bottom of the television barrel. Instead of simply lamenting the state of our popular culture, we think it's a good idea to try and do something about it. So here we are.
<p>
Our objectives are these: to raise a hue and cry across the land; to cast some light on what's being produced and distributed --"Sunlight is the best disinfectant," Justice Brandeis once wrote--and to petition men and women of good will--producers, sponsors, advertisers, and viewers --to rethink their support and sponsorship, participation and promotion of these programs.
<p>
What exactly is the harm being done by these programs? In his "Letter from Birmingham City Jail," Martin Luther King, Jr. instructed us that that which "uplifts human personality" is just and that which "degrades human personality" is unjust. Can anybody doubt that these shows degrade human personality? Do the sponsors think not? If so, why not?
<p>
Let me try and put this campaign in a broader context of the state of our popular culture, our country, and our civilization.
<p>
What is happening today is the pollution of the human environment, a kind of tropism toward the sordid. This nation desperately needs more opportunities for moral uplift. We believe that progress can be made through moral suasion and justifiable public discontent.
<p>
In a fundamental way, that is what this effort and efforts like it are all about. So today we declare ourselves to be part of a Resistance, a Resistance Operation to the giant popular culture sleaze machine. We welcome more volunteers to our ranks.<p>

Let me conclude with a personal note. Joe Lieberman is a Jew. I am a Catholic. Like most Americans, we believe in God; we both believe men and women are His creation, made in His image. And so we believe that men and women should not be celebrated when they debase themselves. <P>

<li>"I'm here to defend the idea that the [tax] rates ought to come down, that it will be flatter, fairer, simpler; they've got to be lower across the board on labor and capital, the factors of production, and we ought to raise revenue for government and not try to redistribute the wealth of America. I don't think that is the purpose of the tax code--the tax code from time immemorial was to raise revenue and reduce the burden on those least able to bear that burden. And frankly, all of our plans--or all of 'the' plans are going to be judged on that basis. Does it raise revenue? Is it efficient for the economy and does it remove the burden on those least able to bear that burden?"

<li>"Bill Bennett, former Secretary of Education and White House Drug Czar, may have just won his biggest political victory: According to The New York Times, Time Warner is trying to sell its 50 percent stake in Interscope Records, the home of socalled gangsta rap...."
<p>
He and Mrs. Tucker both took their concerns directly to Time Warner, where they argued that distributing albums that glorify violence, murder and the abuse of women is fundamentally immoral. Instead of wielding political power against Time Warner, Mr. Bennett and Ms. Tucker brought moral authority to bear: They sharned Time Warner executives, both in private and in public....
<p>
This success should be a paradigm for culture warriors.... Culture cannot be dictated from Washington, it is a matter of millions of personal choices made by millions of people every day. Moral persuasion can affect those personal choices in a way that laws and regulations can't. Snoop Doggy Dogg may not be particularly open to suasion, but if the corporation that made millions off of him is able to rethink its place in the market, and maybe figure out how to make millions of a less noxious product, there is hope.<br>

<li>"It is significant that today nobody--nobody--is willing to defend the current welfare system. And for good reason; it is a complete wreck. After thirty years, we have finally reached a consensus that much of the anti-poverty strategy of the 60s arid 70s has failed--and failed horribly. Poverty today is more widespread, more deeply entrenched and more pathological than it was three decades, and $5 trillion, ago.... It is time to encourage poverty fighting-efforts that are both compassionate and effective, rather than maintaining a system that is neither."<br>

<H3>The Battle for School Choice in Milwaukee</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
Milwaukee has long been the standardbearer for the school choice movement. In 1990, the nation's only government-funded school choice program was enacted in Milwaukee. And in early 1995, Governor Tommy Thompson submitted an expansion plan of the program, which allowed students to redeem vouchers at religious as well as non-religious schools. The plan was approved and passed by the legislature as part of the 1995-97 state budget bill. However, on August 25, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin issued an injunction barring the state from paying tuition for students attending private religious schools until the court rules on whether it is constitutional. Several hundred children had already begun classes as participants in the voucher program. As a result, Partners Advancing Values in Education (PAVE) set up an emergency fund to provide funds for children for the school year.
<p>
Empower America Co-director William J. Bennett traveled to Milwaukee to affirm his support for school choice, and for a program that allows parents to choose either religious or non-religious private schools for their children. Said Dr. Bennett, "This moment in Milwaukee is probably the breakthrough point. This is the beachhead." Bennett toured St. Matthew's, an elementary school participating in the choice program, and was a guest on Charles Sykes' radio program on WTMJ-AM (620). Bennett was joined by Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson and by another former education secretary. They then held a press conference praising the expanded program at Messmer High School, an independent Catholic school. Dr. Bennett summed up the objective of the school choice movement: "This is not an anti-public school effort. This is a pro-good school effort ... Good public schools have nothing to fear from school choice."

<H3>Empower America Sets Conservative Agenda</H3>
<P>
<I>Baltimore Conference Launches 104th Congress</I>
<P>
BALTIMORE, MD: In this city, an hour's drive north of Washington,
DC, three&#171;busy days of seminars, workshops, discussion sessions
(and a bit of speechmaking) in early December brought home the
latest example of how the political landscape of America has changed.
<P>
Previously, under the control of the Democrat House leadership,
only one institution, the Kennedy School of Government in Boston,
had run freshman orientation for incoming members of Congress.
This monopoly had lasted for over
 twenty years. New members would 
have to travel to Massachusetts to actually I 
participate, and topics were often narrow 
and unambitious.
<P>
But in 1994, the Boston organization had to cancel its program
due to lack of interest, since the vast majority of newly-elected 
House freshmen chose to attend an orientation program organized
by Empower America and the Heritage Foundation.
<P>
Held December 811 at the Radisson Plaza in Baltimore, MD, the
conference drew 
a majority of the Republican members- elect, as well as a couple
of their Democrat counterparts. This high energy gathering demonstrated
that the incoming Republican majority plans to hit the ground
running to deliver the real change America endorsed on November
8.
<P>
The days were packed with programs and presentations designed
to supplement incoming members' knowledge of issues they'll face
in the 104th Congress, as well as highlighting dramatic, conservative
alternatives to 30 years of Great Society philosophy. Nearly 50
conservative experts in all major issues of domestic and foreign
policy attended.
<P>
New members took the lead in debating innovative alternatives
on issues such as welfare reform, crime, defense and farm policy.
They also worked to plan legislative strategy and tactics on reforming
Congress, strengthening America's health care system, tackling
the over regulation that the Federal government imposes on states
and individuals, and limiting congressional terms.
<P>
They discussed how to draw on the new conservative majority in
the country to construct coalitions necessary to effect change
in Washington. And how to balance their professional obligations
with the needs of their families, so that families will always
come first.
<P>
All five of Empower America's co-directors, Lamar Alexander, Bill
Bennett, Jack Kemp, Jeane Kirkpatrick and Vin Weber spoke at the
conference and participated in smallgroup meetings, sharing advice
and insights which they hoped would be valuable to the attendees,
both personally and professionally.
<P>
One of the orientation's highlights came at its conclusion, with
an address by radio/TV talkshow host Rush Limbaugh- whom many
of the freshman credit, in part, with their victory. According
to Bill Bennett, Limbaugh is &quot;a symbol of encouragement.
He's a pretty reasonable read on what a lot of America thinks.
Rush is a way conservatives know that they're not idiosyncratic.&quot;
To express their appreciation, the freshmen voted to make Limbaugh
an honorary member of their incoming class.
<P>
Limbaugh was quick to return the compliment. 
 &quot;I am in awe of you,&quot; Limbaugh told them, &quot;You took the risks.
You are the ones who engaged the opposition ... You actually went
out and did the work.

<P>
<H3>Grassroots, With Message of Change, Made Difference at Ballot Box</H3>
<P>


Political observers are calling what happened on November 8th
a &quot;tsunami.&quot;
<P>
In Japan, that' s the word for tidal wave. In America, that's
the term for the overwhelming victory conservatives gained at
the federal, state, and local level in 1994's midterm elections.
<P>
Beginning in January, Republicans will control both Houses of
Congress for the first time since 1954. In the U.S. Senate, the
margin will be 5347, a gain of nine seats. All 11 Senate freshmen
will be Republicans. In the U.S. House, Republicans picked up
52 seats, for a 230-204 edge, with one independent. Of the 86-member
freshman class, 73 are Republicans.
<P>
For the first time since 1970, Republicans also have the lion's
share of governors' mansions. They'll control 30 governorships,
in states with 70 percent of the U.S. population.
<P>
But the victories weren't just wide, they were deep. Republicans
now control both houses of 19 state legislatures, while Democrats
control 18.
<P>
In the South, for the first time since Reconstruction, a state
legislative body will be led lay Republicans. The South Carolina
House, which went Republican, hasn't had a GOP majority since
1886. Down the ballot, at all levels, candidates
supporting a powerful and vigorous conservative message won election.
<P>
Keeping this in mind, Empower America Codirector Jack Kemp observes,
&quot;The 1994 elections rivaled Ronald Reagan's 1980 victory
in its importance to the conservative movement.&quot;
<P>
What made the difference in the 1994 election was the dedicated
effort of grassroots activists, who constructed a network of information
and support that bypassed both the media and, in many cases, the
established political parties. Compared to previous midterm elections,
turnout was up. Polling data indicates that many of those who
voted intended to send a message for conservative change. This
turnout was the key difference in many close races - the defeat
of House Speaker Tom Foley, House Judiciary Committee chairman
Jack Brooks, and Senate Budget Committee Chairman (and
likely next Senate Democrat leader) Jim Sasser.
<P>
So dramatic was the mandate for change voiced in November that
no less than the <I>Washington Post's </I>David Broder, dean of
the Washington pundits, saw in the results the evidence for a
massive political realignment - a return to the political landscape
as it looked before the New Deal.
<P>
However, to make re-alignment a reality requires even more effort
in 1995 and 1996, to make sure the 104th Congress delivers on
the change its leaders promised. According to a recent Times-Mirror
poll, 52 percent of Americans approve of the GOP's plans for the
future. Reducing crime, reforming welfare, cutting the deficit,
cutting middle class taxes, and a balanced budget amendment are
all supported by a majority of Americans.

<H3>A Letter from the President</H3>
<P>
<I>Dear Empower America Members: </I>
<P>
Our hard work during the last two years has definitely paid off!
Because of your dedication to ideals and policies that empower
individuals and families, our country has witnessed one of the
most historic elections of our time. As a result, we have elected
a new Congress committed to the empowerment agenda.
<P>
Through our candidate schools, issue briefs, radio actualities,
newspaper editorials and numerous other media opportunities, Empower
America has been pleased to play its role in the 1994 elections.
We look forward to the months and years ahead as a continuation
of our responsibility to help shape the conservative future of
America.
<P>
Therefore, this is not a time to rest. We must remain an active
voice in all the debates on policy that affect our daily lives.
This is an opportunity for us to propose progressive ideas for
the future of our country and our children. The days of the tax
and spend liberals controlling the agenda and our pocket books
are over!
<P>
It is because of concerned citizens like yourself, the ones that
only want a strong and stable country for our children, that this
Congress is like no other one before. It is
important that you remain in the fight. We will need you for every
battle that comes up on Capitol Hill. This new Congress must know
what the American people need and want from their government.
You are the only way they will know.
<P>
Thank you for your support of Empower America.
<P>
Sincerely,
<P>
<B>Bill Dal Col</B>
<P>
<I>President</I>

<H3>Kirkpatrick Unveils Foreign Policy Critique</H3>

<P>

WASHINGTON, D.C.: On the fifty-third anniversary of Pearl Harbor
Day, Dr. Jeane J. Kirkpatrick released a new Empower America publication
entitled <I>Security and Insecurity: A Critique of Clinton Policy
at MidTerm </I>at a crowded, well-attended press conference at
the Willard Hotel.
<P>
Dr. Kirkpatrick said that given the &quot;major events through
which we are living ... responses that would be required are much
stronger than have been given. And the leadership that is needed
is much stronger, more purposeful, serious leadership than has
been available. And the strength that is needed, both I think,
moral, political and strategic, of the United States is greater
than has been available.&quot;
<P>
In opening remarks, Empower America Chairman Malcolm S. Forbes,
Jr. said that &quot;We believe that the midpoint of this 
Administration - the
two year mark - is a good time to do a thorough examination
of its foreign and defense policies. A variety of experts were
brought together by Jeane to do this book.&quot;
<P>
But the volume is not just limited to criticism. In an article
entitled &quot;U.S. Security Policy for the Nineties&quot;, Dr.
Kirkpatrick outlines what Mr. Forbes described as &quot;Empower
America's foreign policy approach . . . pro-democracy, pro-growth,
pro-opportunity.&quot;
<P>
Calling Dr. Kirkpatrick &quot;perhaps the seminal thinker of America's
role in this emerging world,&quot; EA Codirector Jack Kemp said
that one of &quot;lessons of the 20th century is that weakness
is provocative,&quot; and while &quot;foreign policy, trade policy,
defense policy have been bipartisan in support .. . we at EA have
been quite moderate in our critique of the first two years of
the Clinton administration.&quot;
<P>
Twenty-one of the more than thirty experts who contributed essays
to <I>Security and Insecurity </I>attended the press conference.
The book offers a comprehensive analysis of the Clinton national
security record, including foreign, defense, intelligence, information,
international economic, regional and countryspecific analyses.
It is available by sending $3.00 to Empower America, 81776 I Street,
NW, Suite 890, Washington, DC 20006.

<H3>EA Ads Tout Flat Tax</H3>

<I>Radio and Television Campaign for Reform</I>
<P>
WASHINGTON, DC: Moving the empowerment agenda forward, Empower
America began airing a new radio ad the week of January 9th. The
60second spot advocates replacing the current variablerate tax
system with a flat tax.
<P>
The ad, the first in an advertising campaign supporting the flat
tax, will be heard on news and talk radio stations in Iowa, New
Hampshire and Arizona. Empower America Codirector Jack Kemp set
the stage for the flat tax with an advertisement, run last month,
calling for lower acrosstheboard taxes, cutting and indexing capital
gains taxes, and raising the personal exemption for all families.
This generated considerable support.
<P>
The ad's text is as follows:
<P>
<B>Announcer</B>
<P>
<I>
Two years ago, President Clinton raised
taxes by over 250 billion dollars.
Now Clinton says he wants to cut taxes by
just 60 billion dollars. It's not enough. 
Clinton's high taxes, big spending, and
soaring interest rates are a blueprint for 
recession. To get the economy going, we need 
a real tax cut. It' s called the flat tax - 
and it' s one low rate of 17 percent will 
really cut taxes, while needy and working 
families will pay even less. The flat tax will
eliminate taxes on interest, dividends, and 
capital gains - encouraging savings, invest-
ment, and new jobs. Tax cuts worked for 
President Kennedy; they worked for President 
Reagan. What' s more, Americans could file 
their income taxes on a post card. 

To tell Bill Clinton you want a real tax cut, 
join the fight for the flat tax by calling 
Empower America at 1-800-332-2000.
</I>
<P>
Striking these same themes, Kemp along with Co-director Bill Bennett
delivered a one minute message on national CNN just prior to President
Clinton's January 24 State of the Union address.
<P>
The time, purchased by Empower America, criticized the Clinton
tax proposals and offered an economic vision for America's future,
renewing the call for a flat tax that will bring jobs and tax
relief for America's families.
<P>
The television spot, promoted by radio spots on January 23 and
24, reached a large and politically diverse audience. Empower
America hopes that such widespread exposure to these views will
encourage national discussion.
<P>
Congress is receptive to dramatically changing the tax system,
and both the House and Senate will be holding hearings during
the next several months to examine ways to reform the system,
simplify tax collection, and reduce tax rates. Empower America
will work energetically over the next several months to keep its
members informed and involved, to organize grassroots efforts
supporting the flat tax, and to let Congress know that Americans
support a flat tax.

<H3>Empower America Interview: Michael Harrison</H3>

<P>
<I>Michael Harrison is the editor and publisher of </I><B>TALKERS
Magazine, </B><I>the major trade publication in the talk radio
industry. As such, he presides over the nation's largest data
base about the medium in addition to researching the opinions
expressed by hosts and callers. In this role, Mr. Harrison has
emerged as the leading spokesman for talk radio and what he refers
to as the &quot;new media&quot; and is one of the most sought
after analysts of American public opinion. Mr. Harrison is a regular
guest on radio talk shows and network television in addition to
being constantly quoted in most of the nation's major news publications.
He also hosts </I><B>TALKERS Magazine's </B><I>nationally syndicated
weekly program, &quot;The Talk Radio Countdown Show,&quot; which
overviews the hottest topics of theweek on talk radio, and continues
to guesthost local talk shows whenever he has the time regularly
filling in on WRC Radio during his many visits to the nation's
capital</I>
<P>
<I>EMPOWER AMERICA:</I> What impact did talk radio have on the 1994 elections?
<P>
<I>MICHAEL HARRISON: </I>First of all, talk radio proved to be
an accurate bellwether of American public opinion foretelling
the results of the election as early as two years ago. As a spokesman
for the field, I've had to defend the accuracy of talk radio to
the mainstream press more than a hundred times during the past
couple of years. TV news and many of the daily papers would downplay
the sentiment expressed by both hosts and callers on talk radio
as representing a &quot;small but vocal&quot; segment of the population
of reflecting a &quot;conservative Republican bias.&quot; Or worse,
they denigrated it as playing to a &quot;radical fringe.&quot;
The point is, talk radio did not cause the election to happen
the way it did. Talk radio forecasted it. As such, talk radio
has shown itself to be more in touch with the American people
than any other of today's mass media. In doing so, it provided
the people of this nation with the opportunity to discuss the
real issues of the day and exchange populist views. It is only
in that context that talk radio impacted the election. It provided
a vehicle for public opinion which
already existed to play itself out and reach some sort of collective
resolution.
<P>
<I>EA:</I> Will there be an increase in &quot;liberal&quot; talk
radio as a result of the 1994 election?
<P>
<I>MH:</I> Only if the newly elected politicians who call themselves
&quot;conservatives&quot; are ineffective, corrupt, arrogant and
elitist and besmirch the concept of popular conservatism. You
see, I don't believe that the ever-growing talk radio audience
is inherently Democrat or Republican in a partisan sense. Nor
are they unilaterally liberal or conservative. I think the average
thinking American here at the end of the Twentieth Century is
more prone to be an active Independent. At the moment, the conservatives
are more accurately addressing these concerns than the liberals.
But actions speak louder than words and more and more, the American
public is able to perceive the difference between talk and deed.
The biggest mistake politicians on both sides of the fence can
make is to think that the electorate is primarily composed of
party faithful. In the old days the term &quot;independent&quot;
was usually associated with &quot;apathetic.&quot; Today, however,
the independent voter is more likely the most active. That's today's
gigantic difference.
<P>
<I>EA: </I>What will the state of the industry be two years from
now, during the 1996 elections? What role will talk radio have
on the next election cycle?
<P>
<I>MH:</I> Talk radio will set the pace for the entire mass media. Now
that the mainstream media, particularly the press, have caught
wind of talk radio's position in the political scheme of things,
its proclivity to play the leader, will insure this prediction
coming true. The 1996 election will be played out on talk radio
and that ensuing scenario will be amplified and cemented in the
mainstream media. As far as the details of the next election are
concerned, I'm not an astrologer&#151;but I can give you this
insight, this hint: Talk radio does not choose its good guys and
bad guys simply based on party line or academic political ideology.
It bases these things on personality, character and the handling
of &quot;people&quot; concerns on an issue to issue basis. Look
what's going on in Massachusetts. The same hosts who beat the
daylights out of Dukakis for his ultraliberalism have just turned
like vicious dogs on the conservative William Weld for supporting
a 55 percent legislative pay raise on the heels of the election.
<P>
EA: Do you consider talk radio to have more entertainment, news
or education value?
<P>
<I>MH: </I>Ah, now that's the question talk radio programmers
are constantly wrestling with. Finding the perfect balance between
information and entertainment. This is not a media characteristic
peculiar to talk radio. Television news, newspapers, even Presidential
campaigns are preoccupied with capturing attention and developing
interest. Or to put it another way, to avoid being boring at all
costs&#151;even if it means leaving out important information
or glossing over serious, complex issues. Fortunately, we live
at a time when a growing portion of the American public finds
news and public affairs entertaining. The problem is when the
public expects and demands that it be entertaining first and foremost.
Remember during the Persian Gulf War when people talked about
going home at night to &quot;watch&quot; the war on CNN and began
to complain when it started to get &quot;boring?&quot; At least
half the audience viewed it as just another miniseries. So yes,
talk radio is entertainment. . . but so is Connie Chung. And so
are political debates. And so are political conventions. That's
why the networks no longer cover then gavel to gavel. Shakespeare
understood this hundreds of years ago.
<P>
<I>EA: </I>What is the proper role for talk radio in the political
debate?
<P>
<I>MH: </I>To create an environment that will draw a large audience
while maintaining a fair and even playing field. That's the ideal.
Uq,fortunately, the fair and even playing field often suffers
in the process of drawing the large audience. I only hope that
the bean counters who ultimately control talk radio&#151; or at
least will gain more control over the medium as it continues to
show itself to be a potential moneymaker&#151;don't overresearch
and package it to the point that it loses the rough edges and
accessibility to the people that I believe is at the core of its
impact.
<P>
<I>EA: </I>What new technologies can we expect from talk radio,
such as interaction with online computer services, etc.?
<P>
<I>MH: </I>Fifty years from now, today's talk radio will be looked
back upon as the
<P>
primitive public address system of the emerging 21st century electric
age democracy. As far as the present is concerned, talk radio
makes maximum effective use of existing technologies to make twoway
mass communications fantastically accessible and immediate&#151;
telephony, satellites, and digital transmission technology make
talk radio amazingly flexible and ubiquitous. The next step is
universal interaction with online computer services. <I>TALKERS
Magazine is </I>about to go online with CompuServe. The relationship
between talk radio and online services, the Internet, will be
close.
<P>
<I>EA: </I>Why has there been a recent resurgence in interest
in talk radio, and when did it begin to come into its own?
<P>
<I>MH: </I>Talk radio's been around for ages, but I trace the
real beginning of the modern era of talk radio to the removal
of the Fairness Doctrine in 1987 which opened
<P>
the door up to stations feeling free to tackle controversial issues.
Prior to that, the Fairness Doctrine actually had a chilling effect
on the discussion of public policy in the electric media. But
that's just one factor. In the late eighties, you had all these
AM stations being beaten up by FM music stations so they turned
to talk which sounds just fine on AM. Also, talk radio addressed
issues and reflected public opinion in a way that was largely
ignored by the mainstream press and media, so it filled a massive
void and garnered tremendous public support. Other factors that
contributed to talk radio's growth have been the changing demographics
of the nation&#151;boomers are extremely interested in public
policy&#151;as well as the fact that talk radio is great company.
People are lonely and talk radio provides a sense of community
that's missing in the modern world. Then there's the advertising
aspect of talk radio. It's a powerful advertising medium <B>because
</B>it has such an active and interested audience.
<P>
<I>EA: </I>Are stations moving away from locally produced talk
shows to carry more nationally syndicated shows, or are they still
cultivating local talent?
<P>
<I>MH: </I>Both! The average talk station in America is a blend
of the two - and both have proven to be a vital part of the
programming success of talk radio. The networks are providing
local stations with the chance to get into the talk radio business
and provide a solid, national product. That, in turn, creates
the need to supplement the network stuff with a local perspective.
For every job that Rush Limbaugh has taken away, he's created
the need for two.
<P>
<I>EA: </I>Do you see any future Rush Limbaughs on the horizon?
<P>
<I>MH: </I>Yes and no. Yes, I do see tons of new and exciting
talents up and coming in talk radio and I find that very exciting.
But no, I don't think we'll see another &quot;Rush Limbaugh,&quot;
per se. He's one of a kind phenomenon that is actually historical.
If talk radio were rock and roll, then Rush Limbaugh is Elvis
Presley. Of course, as we know, there was only one king of rock
and roll - but that didn't stop him from self-destructing, and
the medium was certainly able to thrive without him.
<P>
<I>EA: </I>How can the public and grassroots organizations best
utilize the power of talk radio?
<P>
<I>MH: </I>The key is to tap into its accessibility without abusing
it. The public, of course can always listen. Callers should avoid
overdoing it as &quot;regular&quot; callers. No one wants to hear
the same person whining on and on using talk radio as a personal
soap box. Organizations should maintain the same rule. Be in touch
with the stations and hosts. Give them information that they want
and believe the public will be interested in. Do not flood them
with self-serving hype and minutia. Remember, talk radio is a business.
Put yourself in its shoes and it'll respond much more readily.

<P>
VOL. 3 NO. 1 
<P>
<H3>The Republican Agenda in the 104th Congress</H3>

<P>
<I>Now in control of both the House and Senate for the first time
in four decades, Republicans face the challenge of legislative
leadership. Fortunately, preparation for this welcome challenge
began during the campaign season when Republicans gathered on
the steps of the Capitol to sign their </I>Contract With America.
<I>This contract lays out the blueprint for thefirst 100 days
of the 104th Congress. The ten points of the </I>Contract <I>are
as follows.</I>
<P>
<B>Fiscal Responsibility Act</B>
<P>
Under this Act, Congress will vote on a balanced budget amendment
and the line item veto. The aim of this legislation is to force
Congress to live within its means and to restore financial accountability
to the budget.
<P>
<B>Taking Back Our Streets Act</B>
<P>
This provision takes a get tough approach to crime fighting;
calling for stiffer punishment, placing more police on the street,
and implementing truthinsentencing legislation that requires convicted
criminals to serve their full sentences.
<P>
<B>Personal Responsibility Act (Welfare Reform)</B>
<P>
The focus of this Act is twofold: (1) to encourage people to work,
and (2) to discourage people from having children out of wedlock.
Most Americans agree that the welfare system is seriously flawed
and must be dramatically reformed. Dramatic reform is what the
Republican leadership hopes to achieve through this legislation.
<P>
<B>Family Reinforcement Act of 1995</B>
<P>
The federal government has, in the past two decades, intruded
upon the parent/child relationship. This provision seeks to reverse
that trend by placing control of a child back where it belongs - with
the parents. The Act would also strengthen penalties for child
pornographers, and create tax breaks for those who adopt a child.
<P>
<B>The American Dream Restoration Act</B>
<P>
This Act provides a tax credit for families, reforms the &quot;marriage
penalty,&quot; and improves the tax treatment of IRAs. Beginning
in 1996, the bill would allow a $500 per child tax credit for
families with annual incomes up to $200,000. In addition, Americans
would be allowed to contribute up to $2,000 a year into an American
Dream Savings Account (ADSA).
<P>
<B>The National Security Restoration Act</B>
<P>
This provision would reform the Department of Defense by placing
an emphasis on a strong national defense through ensured funding.
It would also ensure that U.S. troops are only deployed to support
missions in the U.S.'s national security interests.
<P>
<B>Senior Citizens' Equity Act</B>
<P>
The senior citizens' earning limit would be raised. This would
end age discrimination for those who choose to work after a certain
age.
<P>
<B>The Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act</B>
<P>
Rolling back government regulation has long been a priority for
Republicans; this Act would slash many burdensome regulations
that strangle small businesses, thus making it easier for investment
and job creation.
<P>
<B>The Common Sense Legal Reforms Act</B>
<P>
This Act will curb excessive lawsuits and limit abuses of the
legal system by overzealous lawyers. This type of reform is crucial
to American competitiveness.
<P>
<B>Citizen Legislature Act</B>
<P>
This Act would force a vote on the issue of term limits for Senators
and House members. This would help put an end to career politicians
and give the American people a citizen legislature.
<P>
<I>These 10 points represent the backbone of the legislative agenda
for the 104th Congress. Empower America will work closely with
Congressional leaders to go forward with these initiatives endorsed
by the American peoples ' vote in November. Empower America 's
Codirector William J. Bennett is fond of telling audiences that
this is a </I>Contract With America, <I>it is not a handshake
with America. It is in this spirit that Empower America will continue
the fight for true reform in the days to come. </I>
<P>

<DD>&quot;Bennett, the former education secretary who took to the
campaign trail this year for an array of candidates, said he was
utterly clear on the meaning of this election. 'It was about limited
government, about the end of the nanny state,' he says. It was
about beginning to reverse 'the discharge of responsibilities
from families and communities and local government onto the federal
government,' and reviving personal responsibility.&quot;

&quot;As opposed to Bill Clinton's effort to 'reinvent government,'
Alexander wants to dismantle it. One problem lies in making sure
someone else&#151;individuals, community groups or local entities&#151;does
the work that federal agencies have been doing for decades.
Alexander's first effort to deal with these and other questions
will come at a &quot;Send Washington Home&quot; conference November

<H3>New York Gala Honors Innovative Governors</H3>

<I>Governors Tommy Thompson, Christine Todd Whitman and John Engler
accept Empower America 's first annual </I><B>Empowerment Awards.</B>
<P>
On November 17th, Empower America held its second annual New York
Gala Dinner aboard the historic USS Intrepid aircraft carrier.
The evening's dinner and discussion were particularly eventful
as Empower America honored Governor John Engler for his changes
in Michigan education policy, Governor Tommy Thompson for the
overhaul of Wisconsin's welfare system, and Governor Christine
Todd Whitman for her bold economic policies in New Jersey. These
governors were the recipients of Empower America's first annual
<I>Empowermerlt Awards&#151;</I>in recognition of their ingenious
and innovative policies benefitting the men and women, business
leaders, families, and children of their states.
<P>
The evening' s patriotic celebration was heightened with the presentation
of the colors by the USS Inchon Color Guard. Empower America Chairman
Malcolm S. Forbes, Jr. presided over the event and began the evening
with an introduction of New York Governorelect George Pataki.
The Empower America Board of Directors welcomed over 500 friends
and supporters as Lamar Alexander, William Bennett,
<P>

Jack Kemp and Jeane Kirkpatrick presented the awards to the Governors.
The energized crowd and impressive lineup of state and local leaders
set the tone for the debate which will resume in the new congress.
<P>
The discussion shed light on the emerging discussion surrounding
illconceived policies at both the national and state levels, in
addition to addressing the federal government's stream of unfunded
mandates. The progressive agendas of Governors Engler, Thompson
and Whitman will be on the leading edge of change -- to restructure
the relationship between the federal government and the states,
and comprehensively change the way that our elected leaders do
business.

<H3>Issue Conference Campaign Tackles Gold Standard</H3>
<P>


<I>Bretton Woods</I>
<P>
On September 8th, Empower America hosted a conference on monetary
policy which commemorated the 50th anniversary of the historic
Bretton Woods Conference. The anniversary conference, which took
place in Washington, DC, featured reputable experts in the field
of economics including Lawrence Kudlow, Arthur Laffer, Lawrence
Lindsey, and Malcolm S. Forbes, Jr., in addition to Empower America
Co-directors Jack Kemp and Vin Weber. 
<P>
Communications Campaign Proves Effective
<P>
Over the past couple of months, Empower America has been waging
an intensive television and radio advertising campaign. Issueoriented
ads have been placed throughout the country opposing bad legislation,
like the Clinton health care plan, and promoting good proposals,
like tax cuts and the A to Z spending cut plan.
<P>
These ads often put Empower America squarely in the middle of
major issue debates. For instance, Department of Health and Human
Services Secretary Donna Shalala publicly attacked an ad that
called President Clinton's welfare reform plan &quot;cynical and
deceptive.&quot; The resulting debate brought to light many of
the Clinton plan's flaws, helping to defeat it.
<P>
Empower America produced one of the most critical television ads
that ran during
the health care reform debate. The ad pulled no punches in asserting
that &quot;President Clinton wants to socialize our health care.&quot;
This ad, with an intensive buy, helped put Empower America on
the front lines of the battle that eventually saw the Clinton
health care plan soundly defeated.
<P>
&quot;Because Empower America is a non-profit non-partisan organization,
our ads can also be run by TV and radio stations as public service
announcements, which many do. Also, stations can hear each ad
through a special digital phone line established to transmit radio
actualities. By absorbing the production cost, Empower America
thus is able to support friendly and conservative TV and radio
stations throughout the country by producing professional issue-oriented
messages. &quot;

<H3>Lamar Alexander Joins Empower America</H3>
<P>
WASHINGTON, DC &#151;Lamar Alexander, former secretary of education
and governor of Tennessee, recently joined the leadership of Empower
America. He will serve as a codirector elong with Bill Bennett,
Jack Kemp, Jeane Kirkpatrick and Vin Weber.
<P>
Since leaving government, Mr. Alexander has remained active in
national politics. He launched a satellite TV network based in
Nashville, TN, which conducts a monthly public policy discussion
through nearly 3,000 town meetings across the country. Alexander's
satellite network will provide another vehicle for the organization
to advance its empowerment agenda among a broad coalition grassroots
activists.
<P>
&quot;Our neighborhood meetings and Empower America fit together
perfectly ' Mr. Alexander said. &quot;I'm delighted to be on the
same team as Bill, Jack, Jeane and Vin, who are constantly challenging
conservatives to say more clearly what we are for.&quot;
<P>
Lamar Alexander is also an advocate for congressional reform and
champions the idea of &quot;cut their pay and send them home.&quot;
His plan includes cutting a congressman's time in Washington and
pay in half.
<P>
Alexander explains, &quot;If members ate their breakfasts in hometown
diners instead of Capitol Hill restaurants such harebrained notions
as turning the health care system over to the government to run,
raising taxes to create jobs, 'reinventing
<P>
welfare' from Washington, DC for the 7th time, would never see
daylight.&quot;
<P>
The new codirector's colleagues, Bennett and Kemp, praised his
addition to the group.
<P>
&quot;I have always respected and admired Lamar's outspoken advocacy
of creative
<P>
solutions to our nation's problems:' Kemp said. I'm thrilled that
he's agreed to join our team and help advance the conservative
cause.&quot;

<H3>Making Ideas Matter in the Fall Elections</H3>
<P>
EmpowerAmerica plays key role in development of popular message
in the fall elections.
<P>
WASHINGTON, DC: As the fall elections draw near, political
experts across the country are predicting big gains for proponents
of the principles of empowerment. In the House of Representatives,
most experts predict a shift of twenty five or more seats into
the conservative ranks. In the Senate, gains of four to seven
seats are not only possible, but likely. The same is true at the
state and local level. Several statehouses and several state legislatures
may move from the domination of liberal control to majority empowerment oriented
control.
<P>
One of the reasons for this success is the ability of conservative
candidates to define a coherent message of limited government
distinguished from that of President Clinton and his liberal allies.
Empower America has played an important role in the development
of this agenda.
<P>
We recently completed a series of successful Candidate Schools,
in which candidates from across the country learned about effective
and viable messages of family and community empowerment over massive
governmental bureaucracy. Now, Empower America has turned its
efforts to helping primary winners develop that same message.
<P>
While not endorsing or supporting any particular candidate, Empower
America has been actively involved with candidates in advancing
the message of empowerment.
<P>
As Congress struggles through the final weeks of the current session,
it is becoming increasingly clear that President Clinton is going
to be a huge millstone around the necks of big-spending, big-government
congressional candidates across the county. This stands in stark
contrast with Empower America's message.
<P>
Candidate School attendees and winners from across the country
are succeeding on the Empower America message. In Rhode Island,
Dr. Kevin Vigilante is running for Congress in the first congressional
district. Faced with strong opposition from Patrick Kennedy, son
of Senator Edward Kennedy, he has overcome huge Kennedy advantages
in name identification and fundraising to be within points of
Kennedy in the polls. Dr. Vigilante is utilizing the facts, theories
and vision advocated by Empower America. Crime, welfare, education
and economic growth define his campaign.
<P>
In Tennessee, attorney and former actor Fred Thompson is running
for the Senate against Congressman Jim Cooper.
<P>
Principal sponsor of the &quot;Clintonlite&quot; health care plan,
Cooper entered the race as the heavy favorite. Thompson, however,
has closed the gap significantly by running a campaign based on the 
principles of empowerment. Advocating a strong welfare reform package as well
as crime and real health care reform, Thompson has made this race
&quot;too close to call&quot; as the days count down to November.
<P>
Empower America also has been briefing candidates who did not
attend the Candidate Schools. Through weekly faxes on issues to
all primary winners and other periodic &quot;urgent updates&quot;
on breaking issues, Empower America is ensuring that all candidates
have access to the powerful message of empowerment.
<P>
When the November elections have come and gone, America will have
taken a step closer to returning power to citizens and local governments
and a step away from the big government control of the last thirty
years. 
<P>

<P>

<H3>A Letter from the President</H3>
<P>
 
Dear Empower America Members:
<P>
These past few months have been very exciting at <B>Empower America</B>
 and we must thank you, our membership, for this. Your continual
interest and involvement in this organization makes it possible
for us to promote the empowerment agenda across the country and
play a leading role in the national debate.
<P>
We are pleased to welcome Lamar Alexander to our leadership as
a codirector. There is no doubt that his involvement with us will
bring vigorous new energy to the public policy debate.
<P>
Empower America has been actively involved in the fight against
the costly crime and health care bills using an aggressive television
and radio advertisement.campaign to deliver our message on
both. Our goal was to activate Americans to participate in the
political system by contacting their representative and senators
and persuading them to vote against these economically destructive
pieces of legislation.
<P>
As the debate over health care continues in the months ahead,
Empower America will lend its voice around the nation to promote
insurance availability, affordability and portability for everyone
without government mandates.
<P>
<B>Now, we are encouraging all of you </B>to become active
in the fall midterm elections. This is a cridcal time for all of
us. This election represents the opportunity to make changes that
will affect the policies governing all of our futures. This is
the time to elect individuals who support the advancement of freedom,
the promotion of
economic growth and the pursuit of solutions to cultural and social
problems.
<P>
The best way to do this is to vote! Research the candidates in
your state and district. Then cast your vote for those who will
support legislation that empowers people and not government bureacracies.
Let's elect individuals to office who represent the most important
special interest: the American people.
<P>
Once again, thank you very much for your support of Empower America.
<P>
Sincerely,
<P>
Bill Dal Col
<P>
President

<H3>Crime in America: A Nation Held Hostage</H3>

<P>
WASHINGTON, DC: Over the past three decades violent crime
has increased by more than 500 percent. America leads the industrialized
world in rates of murder, rape and violent crime. As these
disturbing numbers continue to grow, nearly three out of every
four convicted criminals remain on the street, and the American
public's faith in its government's ability to fulfill its first
priority, to protect its citizenry from enemies foreign and domestic,
steadily erodes. As a result, parents are afraid to let their
children freely roam the neighborhood with their friends; individuals
are afraid to walk the streets of many cities at night;
and law-abiding, hardworking citizens in the nation's inner cities
live with the constant fear of being the next victim of a random
act of violence while traveling to and from their home. In short,
the lawlessness of an incorrigible few has been allowed to alter
the lifestyles of law-abiding citizens throughout the nation. The
Democratic leadership, sensing the urgency of the problem, has
delivered a crime 
bill to the American people. This type of legislation will help,
right? Wrong.
<P>
The recently passed crime bill is being hailed by supporters as
a tough assault on crime, but the specifics of the legislation
betray their rhetoric. Instead of focusing on the principles of
apprehending criminals quickly and sentencing them to terms which
they will actually serve, the bill continues the liberal tradition
of fighting crime by pouring taxpayer money into more untested
social programs aimed at the &quot;root causes&quot; of crime
(e.g. poverty, boredom, low self-esteem). For example, in the recent
legislation one can find:
<UL>
<LI>A provision to teach arts and crafts and establish dance programs;
<LI>A provision designed to increase self-esteem;
<LI>A provision establishing Midnight Sports Leagues.
</UL>
Regardless of what one might think of these programs, it is ludicrous
to present them as answers to the very serious crime problem facing
our nation. Such an ivory tower approach by the social scientists
on 
Capitol Hill who drew up these provisions is an insult to the
average hardworking American who is looking to Washington for
some real help. Most Americans who pay their taxes and fear for
their personal safety would probably not agree that funds, desperately
needed by local law enforcement agencies, would be more wisely
spent by social workers (in the name of crime fighting) to establish
late night basketball leagues.
<P>
Even though there are some meritorious provisions such as the
community policing and prison provisions, these are so encumbered
with restrictive federal language that their beneficial effects
will be severely hampered. Overall, the bill simply possesses
too many untried provisions, is too complex and is too cost-inefficient
to be accepted by an American public under siege and seeking real
reform.
<P>
What can we do? Plenty. First, we must reform our criminal justice
system.
Punishment needs to be swifter, more certain and longer than it
is now. We need to build more prisons, hire more police officers
and prosecutors, implement truth-in-sentencing provisions and overhaul
the current juvenile justice system.
<P>
Numerous police officers and prosecutors around the country tell
of the frustration they face when they see the same offenders
arrested time after time as our 
revolving door justice system places these lifetime criminals
back on the street. Stories of a brutal attack by a criminal on
early release from his or her sentence are becoming all too common.
The system must be altered and it must be soon. The problem is
that legislation such as the crime bill will spend billions of
taxpayer dollars and do little to slow down the revolving door.
<P>
America also needs more police officers and more prisons (the
diluted provisions of the current bill are not sufficient) to
attack the rise in crime seriously. Each time a federal judge
orders a state to release prisoners because of overcrowding, justice
takes another blow and society comes face to face with criminals
who have not served their full sentence all because the state
could not house the offenders. If society expects criminals to
take its laws seriously, then society must be willing and able
to enforce those laws and the punishment that is given to those
who break the law.
<P>
America also faces the problem of juvenile crime. As John DiIulio
of Princeton University has stated, &quot;America is facing a
ticking youth crime bomb. We have burgeoning numbers of young
people who, from all the statistical profiles, are at risk of
becoming violent and repeat criminals.&quot; Once again, this
is a problem we must address by altering the justice system's
handling of young offenders; again, the crime bill presented by
the Democratic leadership does not. There is hope; however, it
is just not in Washington, DC.
<P>
In Richmond, Virginia, Governor George Allen is attempting to
reform a parole system that allows criminals to avoid 
large portions of their sentences. His administration is looking
past the failures of the last three decades and saying it is time
we apply basic principles in our fight against crime. The main
principles are age-old: justice must be swift and it must be sure.
If it is not both of these, it will not be justice. Criminals
seem to understand this very well. It is unfortunate that
President Clinton and those members of Congress who voted for
the most recent crime bill do not.

<H3>How To Cut Government Spending...From A To Z</H3>

<P>
WASHINGTON, DC &#151; A bipartisan coalition of representatives
has presented Congress with the opportunity to restore some measure
of fiscal sanity to the federal budget. Their initiative, known
as the A to Z Spending Cuts Plan after its primary co-sponsors,
Democrat Rob Andrews of New Jersey and Republican Bill Zeliff
of New Hampshire, would hold every member of Congress accountable
for wasteful, inefficient, and unnecessary government spending.
<P>
Ever wonder why Congress can't just repeal the federal Helium
Act (started just after World War I to supply helium to our fleet
of military blimps) and save $1.7 billion? Or save $74 million
over five years by ending treeplanting grants offered by the Small
Business Administration? Or eliminate the $26 million the government
will spend this year to subsidize vacant public housing?
<P>
The answer is that these and hundreds of other federal boondoggles
costing billions are hidden deep inside huge pieces of legislation.
These omnibus spending bills are much more difficult to defeat
than individual examples of ridiculous government spending.
<P>
Liberals argue that the cuts outlined above won't make much of
a dent in the projected 1994 budget deficit of $220 billion. Maybe
so, but that's just a start. Citizens Against Government Waste,
a congressional watchdog organization has published a list of
556 &quot;Prime Cuts&quot; that would reduce federal spending
by nearly $187 billion this year and more than $1.3 trillion over
five years. People can argue the merits and demerits of these
and other spending programs. But supporters of these initiatives
don't want to encourage debate, they want to stifle it.
<P>
Until now, spending cuts which everyone purports to support, such
as the infamous Honey Bee and Mohair subsidies, have been allowed
to escape the budget ax. But for the first time, the A to Z plan
will force legislators to defend absurd special interest spending,
instead of denying responsibility .
<P>
The plan is simple and straightforward. Congress would set aside
an entire week &#151;56 hours of debate&#151;to consider nothing
but spending cuts. There would be no &quot;sacred cows.&quot;
Every government program would be on the table, vulnerable to
an amendment to reduce or eliminate its funding. Each individual
proposal would receive a recorded &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down&quot;
vote. It would only take a simple majority of House members to
eliminate once and for all hundreds of federal programs that serve
no legitimate public purpose. Outdated and wasteful programs will
no longer survive by clinging onto popular proposals. Each member
will be held accountable for his or her vote with no excuses.
<P>
But in Washington, there has to be a catch for any proposal that
makes this much sense. Despite the fact that a strong, bipartisan
majority in the House of Representatives supports the A to Z plan,
Democratic leaders will not allow the proposal to come to the
floor for a vote. If all of the bill's 230 cosponsors would sign
what's known as a &quot;discharge petition,&quot; the legislation
could be discharged from the committee, where it is being bottled
up, and brought to the floor. As of press time, only 204 members
have signed the petition, 14 short of the necessary number.
<P>
Why would someone cosponsor the bill but then refuse to allow
a vote on the plan? Members of Congress sometimes use this tactic
to safely demonstrate support for a popular proposal knowing all
along that they will never have to cast a vote. By doing so, they
are blocking an important deficit reduction tool and contributing
to the deepening level of public cynicism toward Congress as an
institution.
<P>
Pressure is building on A to Z cosponsors who refuse to sign the
discharge petition. The bill continues to inch forward as more
and more legislators feel the heat of public scrutiny. More and
more Americans are demanding responsibility and accountability
in the federal budget process. Constituents want to know exactIy
where their representatives stand on helium reserves, mohair subsidies,
and treeplanting grants.
<P>
The fate of A to Z will help determine the legacy of the 103rd
Congress. That legacy can either be one of missed opportunities,
or one where Congress helped restore the public's faith in America's
elected of ficials. For now, the choice is up to Congress. In
November, the voters will decide.

<H3>Kirkpatrick Speaks at Foreign Policy Forum</H3>
<P>
<I>Calls For Missile Defense Program; says no justification for invasion
of Haiti</I>
<P>
WASHINGTON, DC &#151; Empower America Codirector Jeane Kirkpatrick
called on the Clinton administration to develop a defense for
America against ballistic missile attack. The former U.S. Ambassador
to the United Nations said, &quot;I believe that it is impossible
today for any president to fulfill his pledge to provide for the
defense of the United States without developing an effective missile
defense, period. That is just a fact. Like it; dislike it; it
is a fact of life in our times. And it is incredible to me that
the current Administration should continue its blindness in this
regard.&quot;
<P>
Ambassador Kirkpatrick pointed out that efforts to control
the proliferation of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons
of mass destruction and to stem the development of ballistic missiles
that can carry these weapons to targets long distances away have
reached a &quot;point of breakout&quot; that &quot;simply cannot
be tolerated.&quot; Ambassador Kirkpatrick said we need &quot;to
complete a missile defense program, a space-based missile defense
program which would enable us to defend ourselves and for
us to defend our friends and allies in the world against weapons
of mass destruction.&quot; She concluded by adding that &quot;the
problems are all of our making today in this regard. And this
president bears a heavy responsibility for his decisions in this
area.&quot;
<P>
Ambassador Kirkpatrick also stated that &quot;there should be
no use of force of Haiti.&quot; She
added that &quot;I do not believe that there is an
 American national interest that justifies an
 invasion of Haiti.&quot;
 Ambassador Kirkpatrick was one of
 four distinguished speakers at a recent
 Foreign Policy Forum held by the
 Republican National Committee at which
 she made these remarks. She was joined
by former Secretary of Defense Richard Cheney and former Secretaries
of State Henry Kissinger and James A. Baker III at the Forum to
address current international relations problems and to discuss
the Clinton administration's foreign policy.
<P>
Regarding the current government, Ambassador Kirkpatrick said
that she &quot;believes this administration underestimates the
danger in the world today, under
estimates the role of power and of force in the world, and, in
a curious kind of way, underestimates the force of American values
and institutions in the world.&quot; The countries of the former
Soviet Union are turning to America's values and institutions
as the model for their developing democratic and free market systems.
Therefore,
Ambassador Kirkpatrick said, &quot;It is as terrible a mistake
to underestimate the force of American values, as it is to underestimate
the value of American force.&quot;
<P>
Ambassador Kirkpatrick also evaluated various aspects of the Clinton
administration's foreign policy, pointing out that their actions
stemmed in part from conceptions about the limits of American
power and that &quot;multilateralism was to be at the center of
their foreign policy.&quot; Another key Clinton administration
belief is that America is, &quot;in some fundamental sense, in
a process of inexorable decline. Therefore, they think we should
not seek to act unilaterally in the world, but should act only
multilaterally. Moreover, they clearly believe that multilateral
action is more moral and more legitimate than unilateral action.&quot;
<P>
Further, the Clinton administra
tion has moved to &quot;dramatically
draw down American military
forces, to diminish American weapons and
weapons procurement, to downsize the mil
itary's industrial complex, to reduce
research and development and to concen
trate on producing enough weapons and
maintaining just enough military forces
only, as they always put it, to defend our
own country.&quot; The problem, Ambassador
Kirkpatrick asserted, is that &quot;we can only
do good in the world if we have the power
 to do good in the
 world.&quot; Under the
 Clinton administration, &quot;American
 Power is being 
neglected and dissipated.&quot;
<P>
Ambassador Kirkpatrick's address, 
&quot;U.S. Leadership: The Uses and Abuses of
Multilateralism,&quot; is available from
Empower America's <I>Speeches and 
Lectures</I> senies.

<H3>Empower America Interview: Public Opinion Pollsters 
Edward Goeas and John McLaughlin</H3>
<P>
<I>Mr. Edward Goeas is President and Chief Executive Officer of the
Tarrance Group, a survey and research company located in Alexandria,
Virginia. Mr. Goeas has served as the pollster for a number of
senate and congressional campaigns. He is also the pollster for</I>
U.S. News and World Report.
<P>
<I>Mr. John McLaughlin is a partner of Fabrizio, McLaughlin &amp; Associates,
a national public opinion polling and strategic consulting firm
in Alexandria, Virginia. Mr. McLaughlin has worked on hundreds
of campaigns, most recently as strategist and pollster on Governor
George Allen's campaign in Virginia.</I>
<P>
<B><I>Empower America:</I>What do you perceive to be the major issues
and concerns that will ultimately affect the 1994 elections? What
do you believe to be the &quot;mood&quot; of the nation and what
is on voters' minds?</B>
<P>
<I>Edward Goeas:</I> Issue concerns of the American public are being
voiced at two levels as we enter the final months of the 1994
election. One level is the actual problems voters are concerned
about, and on a second level they are judging incumbents and challengers
alike on their ability to address those concerns with common sense,
workable solutions.
<P>
As concerns over the economy (unemployment, taxes and the deficit)
have dissipatedeover the last year, the American electorate has
refocused on &quot;lifestyle&quot; issues. Crime has been the
major &quot;lifestyle&quot; concern that voters have focused on
for almost a year now, with nearly 41 percent of the electorate
mentioning crime as the number one problem facing the country.
Voter concern over health care, welfare reform, declining values
and education have rounded off these &quot;lifestyle&quot; concerns
now mentioned by six out of ten voters.
<P>
Candidates' ability to put forward credible solutions to these
problems has become much more difficult because of the skeptical
mood of the American elec
torate. After a brief period of optimism, voters have turned even
more cynical about government's ability to effectively address
the problems that they face on a daily basis. This cynicism has
increased as the voters have seen the solutions coming out of
Washington to be more government, more bureaucracy and the demand
for more of their hard earned money.
<P>
<I>John McLaughlin:</I> The Clinton administration appears to be better
able to run a campaign than a government. There is a large policy
gap between their rhetoric and the actual legislation they support.
This leads to three overall themes that appear to be undermining
Clinton's success among the voters. First, since Clinton's election,
American voters have repeatedly told us by a 2 to 1 margin that
they favor less government with fewer services as opposed to larger
government with more services. Clinton talks about less government,
but the facts reveal that all his policies point to larger government.
Americans are becoming more freedomoriented in a technological
age rather than the biggovernment orientation of the Industrial
Age.
<P>
Second, in June we asked voters if they were more concerned about
where a candidate stands on the issues, or about the candidate's
honesty. By a 7 to 3 ratio, the vast majority of Americans prefer
voting for someone who is honest. This is a direct
reflection upon President Clinton's character, or lack of it.
<P>
Finally, American voters are in the midst of a spending revolt.
In the late 1970's we saw America generate a tax revolt. From
our surveys of this year, the voters believe that the federal
government wastes $.42 cents out of every dollar it spends. By
margins of 7080 percent, they prefer cutting government spending
over any measures to raise taxes. Overall, it appears that the
1994 elections will be a state by state referendum for the Senate
and House on Bill Clinton.
<P>
<B><I>EA:</I> In your opinion, is there an empowerment agenda that voters
want?</B>
<P>
<I>EG:</I> Voters are looking for three things; accountability from their
elected officials, the opportunity for individuals and communities
to take more personal responsibility in both their daytoday lives
and their future, and the hope that a renewed emphasis on the
values of honesty, hard work, and a commitment to family and community
will once again put the American Dream within reach for middle
class Americans. The overwhelming majority of voters are certainly
not looking for government to do everything for them, nor are
they looking for an ineffectivc government that is always getting
in their way and hampers their ability to move forward. Proposals
like term limits and national initiatives and referenda receive
support from over 70 percent of the electorate because they are
searching for ways to have a greater say in their government.
<P>
<I>JM: </I> The voters are looking for new ideas. They want to turn away
from the old failed policies of the past and try creative solutions
to their current problems. Voters seem to be very receptive to
the idea of cutting taxes to create jobs. And on a local level,
voters who elected Republican mayors Tom Fetzer in Raleigh, and
Bret Schundler in Jersey City, are efljoying more police on their
streets while at the same time seeing their local taxes cut. Other
ideas to which voters are extremely receptive include: term
limits, workfare, common sense solutions to crime, school choice,
and tax credits for health care coverage. All these ideas would
give people greater control over their lives, and less control
to government. Finally, technology is driving voter beliefs that
they can have more direct democracy.
<P>
<B><I>EA:</I>From your data, do you see a major shift on the horizon
in either the House of Representatives or the Senate for 1994?
Will 1994 be a vote on Bill Clinton's policies?</B>
<P>
<I>EG:</I> As we enter the fall elections, it appears there will be a
substantial gain for Republic ns in both the House and the Senate.
In the Senate, it is likely that Republicans will pick up five
or six seats (with a chance of tak
ing control). In the House Republicans look to gain between
twenty-five to thirty seats (The last time GOP numbers in the House
were over 200 seats was 1954). The reality is that significant 
gains are likely for Republicans come November's elections.
 There is no question that significant gains will force Bill
Clinton to reevaluate the course of &quot;bigger government is
better&quot; that he has set for the country.
<P>
<I>JM: </I> Since last year, it has been apparent from Clinton's lack
of success on the stimulus package and the budget that the Republicans
would have large midterm gains in both the Senate and the House.
In the House, there is a minimum gain of about 15 seats, which
are mainly seats the Republicans should have gained in 1992 after
reapportionment. Add to that the usual historical antiincumbent
setbacks in Congressional elections to the party that controls
the White House, and it's likely that the Republicans will gain
30 seats. A similar antiClinton trend in the Senate would find
the interesting outcome of a 5050 tie, where Vice President Gore
might have to cast deciding votes in the Senate the last two years
of Clinton's term. On the gubernatorial level, Republicans may
have 
the potential for even greater gains. The growing trend for Republicans
with new ideas to attract Perot voters and disenchanted Democrats
is one that appears to be wellfounded for this November's election.
Only the Republicans themselves could lose this opportunity if
they compromise on principle.
<P>
<B><I>EA:</I> From what you see, what are the bellwether races in the
country that will show whether a shift is underway?</B>
<P>
<I>EG:</I> Without going into the numerous races that could be highlighted
as bellwether races, look for surprises in two areas&#151;the
South and West. The South is where resistance toward Bill Clinton's
overall philosophy of governance is
strongest. In the West, voters have increasingly felt that Clinton's
policies coming out of Washington are hostile to the West, and
they are looking to force Washington's policies to either help
or get out of the way.
<P>
<I>JM: </I> The bellwether races in the country certainly include high
profile Senate races, however, for the Republicans to make gains
in the Senate, they are going to have to win in states where Bill
Clinton may still be popular, and the trend towards Republicanism
is less strong. For example, in the Senate, wins by Republicans
that would point to a landslide would include Maine, Ohio, New
Jersey, California, Wisconsin and knocking off Ted Kennedy. A
more important trend regarding ideas could be the successful reelection
of innovative and pioneering governors that Republicans brought
to office four years ago. Voinovich of Ohio, Thompson of
Wisconsin, and Engler in Michigan have all experimented with ways
to keep taxes low, keep the size of government in check and find
creative solutions to problems. At the House level, there are
very interesting races which are absolute bellwethers of change
in the nation.
<P>
Mark Sharpe defeating Sam Gibbons, the House Ways and Means Chairman
of Florida, would be a strong sign that goodoldboy politics is
over with. Tom Davig' strong showing in Virginia's northern suburbs
would show that a successful progressive local executive would
be able to bring new solutions to Washington. And in Rhode Island,
Kevin Vigilante's victory over Patrick Kennedy would be another
setback for the failed liberal policies of the past. Across
the board, the message is change. Republican candidates are
running with the message of change, and all the previously 
mentioned contests will show whether that  message has a
very partisan edge, or whether American 
voters are still confused about who will give them the leadership
they need.
<P>
<B><I>EA:</I>How much change do Americans really want in health care?</B>
<P>
<I>EG:</I> After numerous delays and a year of debate, concern over government
control of health care, the threat of declining quality and increasing
costs, the possible loss of choice in the selection of their personal
doctor has left a bad taste in voters' mouths. Adding to these
negatives is the perception that, with the elections right around
the corner, it would be best to delay final action until the next
legislative year. In fact, the harder Congress pushes for a health
care bill this year, the more the voters are made to feel that
there is something to mistrust in Washington's motives. To many
Americans it looks like Congressional Democrats are rushing health
care reform only to improve their political health and not America's
health.
<P>
<I>JM: </I> Americans want their health care system improved, however,
they don't want the quality of their health care reduced. An early
warning to the Clinton administration came in June when Governor
Lawton Chiles called a special session precisely to enact the
Florida Health Security Act. Republican legislators stood firm
in the state Senate and the House, and nothing passed. There was
very little outcry; in fact, there was a sigh of relief among
Florida voters. Our polls showed that the vast majority had health
care and did not want the government to take it over. Furthermore,
twothirds of the voters were not willing to pay more than $100
a year in higher premiums or tax increases for universalhealth
care. As the details about Clinton's health care plan surfaced,
the voters became extremely concerned that these changes will
reduce the quality of care while increasing the cost. With the
prospect of larger government intervention in health care, the
potential decrease in quality, and an increase in taxes or premiums,
Americans agree this is not the change they need.
<P>
<B><I>EA:</I> From your information, how do you perceive the American
people's response to the Clinton administration's welfare
proposals? Do they find them dramatic or cosmetic?</B>
<P>
<I>EG:</I> The President has lost his &quot;New Democrat&quot; effort
to take over the welfare system as his own. Last year voters felt
that
 Bill Clinton and the Democrats in Congress would do a better job
reforming welfare over Republicans in Congress by nineteen percentage
points. After delayed introduction, and then introduction of a
plan that clearly missed the mark of voter concerns, Republicans
are, once again, seen as best able to address welfare reform.
<P>
<I>JM: </I> Americans responded very well to Clinton's rhetoric to end
welfare as we know it, but it's just rhetoric. Since his first
proposal, they have found out that among those people who currently
receive welfare, over 80 percent of them will continue to 'receive
it under Clinton's welfare proposal because he has exempted the
vast majority of them from work lre requirements. Also, 
the voters are underwhelmed by Clinton's promise of government
subsidized jobs for those who cannot find work in the private
sector. This sounds like merely a shell game rather than an actual
improvement in the system. This is why Clinton would increase
welfare spending by $9 billion dollars. In contrast, there is
a real vacuum in the media to present more popular alternatives.
The best piece of legislation, by Senator Lauch Faircloth and
Congressman Jim Talent, has gone unnoticed. Although endorsed
by Empower America, no one has yet drawn the direct contrast to
the Clinton bill. While Clinton would increase welfare spending
by $9 billion, FairclothTalent would cut it by $5060 billion dollars.
Clinton would only take 12 percent of the people off the rolls,
FairclothTalent would take 50 percent off the welfare rolls, and
FairclothTalent has more initiatives within it to keep families
together and end the destructive disincentives in the current
welfare system.
<P>
<B><I>EA:</I> From your research, is America's
international standing an issue with the voters?</B>
<P>
<I>EG:</I> Traditionally foreign affairs does not play a major role in
nonpresidential elections. In this election cycle, however, background
noise from Bill Clinton's continual mishandling, and sometimes
total incompetence, in the international arena, has made nervous
voters, even more skittish about where our nation is really heading.
It is puzzling to the voters how, in two short years, international
respect for the United States can so quickly plummet with misdirected
foreign policy. The one issue that will play a major part in this
year's election is Bill Clinton's policy to place U.S. troops
under United Nations command. American voters reject this Clinton
policy in overwhelming numbers and want it reversed.
<P>
<I>JM: </I> At present there is very little immediate concern among the
voters with foreign policy, defense, or international issues.
This is primarily because there is no perceived threat to the
voters' freedom and international security. Nevertheless, Clinton
scores very low ratings compared to the previous Republicans.
It is paramount in the voters' minds that Presidents Reagan and
Bush collapsed the &quot;Evil Empire&quot; while Bill Clinton
withdrew in the face of embarrassing opposition from a warlord
in Mogadishu and a band of thugs in Haiti. If there is an intemational
crisis where the United States cannot succeed to preserve this
feeling of security among our voters, Bill Clinton would suffer
drastically in 1996. The last election was an aberration, in that
it was the first election since 1932 where the economy was the
dominant issue. Every other presidential election in between had
an international issue as the dominant or leading factor in deciding
who would win.
<P>
For Clinton, the true wildcard would be a foreign policy setback.
Just like the Panama Canal became a symbol of weak leadership
under Jimmy Carter, Clinton's legislation to force the military
to accept homosexuals, illustrated from the start that he was
more interested in social engineering than.in protecting national
security. The subsequent defense cuts have actually provided reasonable
grounds for voters to believe any foreign policy setbacks are
the direct result of Clinton's policies.

<H3>THE SATELLITE MEDIA TOUR: Empower America's venture into communications
technology</H3>
<P
<P>
WASHINGTON, DC&#151;Reaching the public through earned media
opportunities poses a challenging task for any grassroots organization.
There are many methods for getting the message out, ranging from
the conventional news release, a static relic of oldstyle politics,
to building a new traditionl television or radio network, a costly
and cumbersome undertaking which ultimately reaches a minimal
audience.
<P>
Is there a better way?
<P>
New technology and the '90s information explosion have opened
the door to cheaper, more efficient, and more targeted means to
raise an organization's name and mission profile through the media.
<P>
One such method is the satellite media tour, which Empower America
has utilized with remarkable results.
<P>
Research shows that Americans are more likely to watch their local
news than network news. That means, in order to shape the debate
on current issues, it becomes critical to gain access to local
news broadcasts.
<P>
Using only a studio and uplinks to satellites, Empower America's
opinion 
makers can talk directly with your local TV news anchors and reporters,
free of the &quot;insidethebeltway&quot; news filter.
<P>
Empower America has conducted four satellite media tours. In September
1993, Bill Bennett discussed the results of the American Legislative
Exchange Council and Empower America Report Card on American Education
with local news stations across the country. Through the use of
fiber optics, Empower America chairman Malcolm S. Forbes, Jr.,
and other Empower America leaders, conducted a remote satellite
media tour in December 1993, live from Empower America's national
summit on the Clinton economic record. On June 6, 1994, Jack Kemp
and Jeane Kirkpatrick reflected on the 50 years since DDay during
a one and onehalf hour satellite tour for local TV stations doing
original reporting marking the 50th anniversary of that historic
day. And on August 11, 1994, Malcolm S. Forbes, Jr. conducted
a tour on health care reform plans and the debate in Congress.
<P>
Satellite media tours have enabled 
Empower America's leaders to talk with 27 TV stations, in roughly
ten minute increments each, for live broadcast or livetotape for
later use.
<P>
And the cost? The D-Day anniversary satellite tour tells all. On
June 6, 1994, Empower America reached 2 million actual viewers
at a cost of onefifth of a penny 
per viewer.
<P>
Empower America used satellite communications to make available
its 60-second TV ad on the Clinton health care plan to 1,800 television
stations and cable carriers across the country, for their use
in original news coverage or as a public service announcement.
In this case, satellite technology enabled Empower America to
greatly expand coverage for an alreadyproduced product, at modest
additional cost.
<P>
Satellite communications technology is costeffective and highly
efficient for grassroots organizations to harness the same power
as tbe major television networks.
<P>
Empower America is helping lead the conservative movement through
this exciting information revolution.

<H3>Empower America <I>Speeches &amp;Lectures</I></H3>
<P>

<B>Remarks by George Gilder<BR>
<I>At EmpowerAmerica's
San Francisco Regional Conference</I></B>
<P>
...What's going on in electronics with this exponential upsurge
is not comrnodity competitioh, it's dynamic competition. It's
creative destruction. And what is optimal now in technological
competition, technology competition focuses on innovation, and
innovation is the pursuit of the temporary positions of monopoly&#151;that's
what innovation is. And innovation is an advance that nobody else
has for a while. It's a monopoly...That's what motivates high
levels of investment and risktaking in technology advance. But
if you begin a race by saying nobody can win, and nobody can make
any money, you essentially prohibit the creation of a real broadband
infrastructure in dynamic advances in electronics and communications...

<B>&quot;Building Bridges To Build
A Better Michigan&quot;
<BR><I>
By John Engler, Governor of Michigan Addressing the Greater Detroit
Chamber
of Commerce Mackinac Conference</I></B>
<P>
...How did we turbocharge Michigan's economy? By cutting taxes,
cutting red tape and holding the line on government spend
ing. We made tough decisions, built partnerships, and we worked
together. Just as Michigan companies are reengineering the way
they do business, we are reinventing state government&#151;from
top to bottom...
<P>
<B>&quot;Capitalism and Democracy
American Style: Can They Co-Exist?&quot;
<I>
By Theodore J. Forstmann,
Founding Chairman, Empower America Grants Political Conference</I></B>
<P>
..No political freedom, their words echo down to us, is secure
where the right to property, the fruit of one's own intellectual
or physical labor, is not strong. Government's job, our Founders
all believed, was basically to create a stable environment in
which free people could operate; to provide the permanent political
conditions in which economic changes would inevitably occur. This
was all basic noncontroversial stuff. And so, for example, in
Wilson's day, Americans paid no more than 10 percent of their
earnings to all levels of govemment. When the income tax was first
proposed in l909, one senator rose to suggest a constitutional
limit of ten percent. And it's staggering to reflect how this
suggestion was greeted. After further heated debate, the idea
was rejected on the 
grounds that if a ten percent maximum were set, the income tax
might inevitably rise to that ominous level...
<P>
<B>&quot;The Real War On Crime: 
States On The Front Lines&quot;
<I>
By George AUen, Governor of Virginia
Addressing The Governor's Forum</I></B>
<P>
...The surge in violent crime is more than a &quot;thief in the
night&quot; stealing some one's belongings. It is stealing something
much more precious: our freedom. It is denying our citizens their
unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness;
their right to work, live and raise a family without being terrorized
and victimized by violent criminals and lawlessness...
<P>
...There is only one way to stop it [crime], and that is to take
the people who are committing the violence&#151;that small percentage
of criminals who commit the vast majority of crime&#151;and get
them out of the free society that they have declared war on. Because
one thing is certain: The one place a violent career criminal
won't harm more innocent people is in prison...
<P>
..But the last thing we need from Congress is more expensive social
spending designed to fight crime. If social welfare spending were
the answer to crime, the street corners of America would be far
and away the safest in the world. This approach has failed us
for the past 30 years, and will continue to fail. We in the states
need flexibility, we need to cover the costs of prison construction,
and we need the freedom to combat violent crime with the commonsense
methods our citizens demand.

VOL. 2 NO. 3 FALL 1994
<P>

<H3>Empower America Draws the Line on Health Care</H3>
<P>
WASHINGTON, DC&#151; Empower America's goal in the health care
debate has been to defeat any health care reform plan that includes
individual or employer mandates, price caps or controls, standard
benefit packages, more government interference, or higher taxes.
<P>
Empower America advocates more sensible, targeted health care
reform and is promoting marketoriented reforms that include tax
breaks for individuals and the selfemployed; making insurance
affordable, accessible, and portable; instituting taxfree Medical
Savings Accounts; medical malpractice reform; and voluntary purchasing
pools.
<P>
Empower America has been advancing its health care goals on a
variety of fronts, including an aggressive advertising campaign,
an effort to mobilize members and numerous television and radio
appearances.
<P>
The advertising campaign consists of a widely shown television
commercial and a series of more targeted radio commercials. Using
an electrocardiogram on a black screen with audio of a normal
heartbeat, the television ad
states that President Clinton's plan would &quot;socialize our
health care&quot; system. The ad notes that small businesses will
be called upon to pay the bill for what amounts to &quot;the largest
government bureaucracy in history.&quot; As the text and the narrative
continue, the EKG and heartbeat steadily increase in speed and
severity, culminating in a flatline across the bottom of the screen
and a terminated heartbeat.
<P>
The impact of Empower America's television ad is best demonstrated
by the outcry from the White House and the Democratic party. The
administration and the Democratic National Committee have made
the following critical comments about Empower America's television
ad on health care.
<UL>
<LI>On May 21, White House advisor George Stephanopoulos appeared
on 
CNN's &quot;Capital Gang.&quot; A clip of Empower America's ad
was shown during this particular show. Stephanopoulos commented
that the ad was a &quot;scare tactic&quot; and that &quot;people
aren't going to buy it.&quot;
<LI>Democratic Media Consultant Mandy Grunwald called Empower
America's radio ads on health care &quot;partisan politics&quot;
in the Wall Street Journal on June 30. She went on to assert that
Empower America and The American Cause &quot;believe in doing
whatever they can to damage the president.&quot;
<LI>On a PBS panel discussion on July 18 addressing health
care advertising, Democratic National Committee
Communications Director Ed Lazarus called the Empower America
television ad the most irresponsible and offensive ad of the entire
health care debate. He characterized the ad as misleading and
called the use of the word &quot;socialize&quot; a scare tactic.
Lazarus went on to criticize Empower America for the negative
tone and the absence of an alternative solution to the health
care problem in the ad. At the same event, AARP Policy Director
John Rother and Health Care Reform Project's Bob Chlopak agreed
with Lazarus' assessment of Empower America's ad.
<LI>Also on July 18, Vin Weber appeared on PBS's &quot;MacNeil/Lehrer
News Hour&quot; along with the DNC's Ed Lazarus, the RNC's Chuck
Grecner,
 and Bob Chlopak of the Health Care Reform Project (a group closely
tied with and partially funded by the DNC) to discuss health care
advertising. Chlopak said the television ad was &quot;aimed at
inflaming public opinion...There are no facts, no documentation
in the ad.&quot;
<P>
In addition to the television ad, Empower America has run a series
of radio ads on health care reform. An ad advocating a delay on
health care legislation until after the November election aired
nationwide and two other ads, which quoted prominent Democrat
senators, played in targeted markets. One ad quoted Senator Jay
Rockefeller saying, &quot;We're going to push through health
care reform regardless of the views of the American people,&quot;
and the other quoted Senator Ted Kennedy speaking of health
care saying, &quot;We l want people to understand very quickly
what they are entitled to and what they're not entitled to.&quot;
<P>
Empower America began its first targeted  state ad campaign
in Nevada recently. Nevada was chosen because a 
majority of its Congressional delegation has expressed support
for the Clinton health care proposal. The television and radio
ads created a great deal of media attention in Nevada and nationwide.
The ads generated a significant grassroots campaign against the
health care position of Nevada ' s more liberal members of Congress.
Massachusetts soon followed and other states will be targeted
as the debate continues.
<P>
Empower America's ads have also been featured in news stories
by ABC News, CBS News, CNN's &quot;Inside Politics&quot; and &quot;Capital
Gang,&quot; PBS's &quot;MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour,&quot; <I>The Wall
Street Journal</I>, Associated Press, and dozens of other media outlets.

<H3>EMPOWER AMERICA IN THE NEWS</H3>
<P>
<I>In addition to coverage in the national media, Empower America
also generates substantial coverage in the local and regional
press. Here is a snapshot of recent news stories that discuss
Empower America:</I>
<P>
<DL>
<DT>&quot;Empower America, the conservative coalition founded by
Jack Kemp, Bill Bennett, Jeane Kirkpatrick and Vin Weber, has
hit the airwaves with their own ads, which warn that the
Clintons' plan would 'socialize our health care.' These ads reflect
the growlng opposition to anything that smacks of another entitlement
program. That is the last thing that our fragile economy and debt-ridden
government needs.&quot;
<DD><B><I>The Atlanta Journal and Constitution, </I>May 26, 1994</B>
<DT>
&quot;Empower America, a conservative political organization,
urged members of Congress to postpone final passage of any health
reforms until after the November elections. Its leaders, including
William Bennett, Jack Kemp and Vin Weber, attacked the 'ttzggered'
requirement that employers pay for health insurance as 'merely
a rest stop on the road to socialized medicine.&quot;' 
<DD><B><I>The Ketchikan Daily News,</I>Ketchikan, AK, June 14, 1994</B>
<DT>
&quot;EMPOWER AMERICA CHOOSES NEVADA: Empower America (EA)
launched a TV and radio ad campaign in NV to oppose Clinton's
[health wcare] plan. The 60sec. ads are airing in Las Vegas and
Reno. 'Using an electrocardiogram on a black screen with audio
of a normal heartbeat,' the TV ad maintains Clinton's plan would
'socialize' the system. The radio ad 'urges Congress to postpone
health care legislation until next year.&quot;'

<DD><B><I>The Hotline; </I>American Political Network, July 13,
1994</B>
<DT>
&quot;Empower America criticized Mr. Clinton's plan as socialized
medicine and urged that the health care debate be delayed until
next year after the November election when Republicans stand a
good chance of making significant gains.&quot;

<DD><B><I>The New York Times, </I>July 12,1994</B>
<DT>
&quot;[William 1.] Bennett said that he prefers a [welfare] policy
that cuts off benefits for any illegitimate child born after a
certain date... 'If they know they will not get anything from
the government, people will have to change their behavior. The
real message is you should not have children...unless you are
able to support them.&quot;'

<DD><B><I>The Courier-Journal, </I>Louisville, KY, June 19, 1994</B>
<DT>
&quot;'This is classic Clinton [on welfare reform], except to
the nth degree: Overpromise, underdeliver, and then try to fudge
the difference, 'said William Bennett, former education secretary
and drug czar in Republican administrations who now heads an advocacy
group called Empower America. 'What we've got here is marginal
tinkering which will cost more money.&quot;'

<DD><B><I>Newsday,</I> New York, NY, June 15,1994</B>
<DT>
&quot;A leading spokesman for conservative ideas, Bennett thinks
the nation can still recover its triedandtrue social standards.
'This is America,' [William J.] Bennett says. 'You know the American
capacity for selfrenewal. Look at what we have overcome in 200
years: England, King George, slavery, the Great Depression, fascism,
communism. This country has a tremendous record of going up against
very tough things and prevailing. But this one's a little different
because it's internal. But you never count this country out.&quot;'
<DD><B><I>The Dispatch, </I>Cookeville, TN, April 24,1994</I>
<DT>Jack Kemp, Codirector of the think tank called Empower America,
and a hope for imbuing capitalism with compassion, reminds again
how the most vulnerable among us were hurt by a welfare system
that sent a destructive message that was indifferent to a moral
life. 'It is an exarnple of how the capital of the human spirit
can be squandered in the course of a few generations,' he said
in a recent call for cultural and spiritual renaissance.&quot;

<H3>Empower America Continues the Fight for Real Welfare Reform</H3>
<P>
WASHINGTON, DC&#151;At present, those pushing for welfare reform
in Washington must await the outcome of the health care debate,
and may have to wait until the next Congress to see any legislation
actually reach the House and Senate floors. Even so, the lines
of disagreement have been drawn during the 103rd Congress. The
benchmark for the debate was set by President Clinton during the
1992 campaign when he promised to &quot;end welfare as we know
it.&quot; Unfortunately, like many of his promises, this bold
statement has not been supported by any meaningful legislative
language from the White House.
<P>
Eighteen months into his administration, President Clinton introduced
his long awaited welfare reform plan. After capitu l lating to
the liberal special interests in the House of Representatives
(specifically the Congressional Black Caucus), Clinton unveiled
a plan draped in conservative rhetoric, but founded upon the proposition
that risking a rift between the White House and the liberal wing
in Congress would be too high of a price to pay in order to help
repair the societal damage being inflicted by the present welfare
system. The result of this capitulation is legislation that proposes
mere tinkering with the present system instead of true reform.
<P>
On the Republican side there is dis l agreement as well. As was
mentioned in the spring newsletter, Empower America
has helped lead the fight for legislation that will truly &quot;end
welfare as we know it.&quot; This means moving past the original
House Republican bill to a more ambitious bill. This approach
is embodied in the TalentFaircloth Welfare Reform Act of 1994.
The TalentFaircloth bill is based on three basic principles:
<UL>
<LI>Ending the subsidization of outofwedlock births;
<LI>Enhancing work requirements for individuals on welfare;
<LI>Controlling welfare spending.
</UL>
<P>
Although the Republican bill has some worthwhile provisions, it
does not take the bold steps found in the TalentFaircloth approach.
And while President Clinton gives lip service to the basic principles
found in the TalentFaircloth bill, his legislation violates all
of them.
<P>
Meanwhile, the Empower America effort on behalf of reform is continuing.
Empower America Codirector William Bennett has appeared at one
press conference on Capitol Hill to endorse the TalentFaircloth
bill, and at another press conference to decry the fraudulent
reform being proposed by the Clinton administration. In a USA
Today article, Bennett was quoted as saying &quot;the Clinton
proposal is a onehalf joke, onehalf fraud.&quot;
<P>
In addition to Dr. Bennett's many efforts, the policy division
of Empower America is lending its help to reformers 
such as Congressman James Talent and Senator Lauch Faircloth by
providing information to members of Congress as to the necessity
for dramatic reform. &quot;Many individuals on the Hill simply
don't understand the suffering being wrought by the current system,&quot;
says Peter Wehner, policy director for Empower America. &quot;We
are finding more members of Congress are willing to support the
TalentFaircloth bill once they are given all the facts.&quot;
<P>
Empower America will, according to Wehner, &quot;use all its resources
to help bring about real reform.&quot; The reason for Empower
America's tenacity is obvious&#151;the current welfare system
has wrought havoc on the American poor. After three decades of
welfare programs the nation is faced with an underclass that is
much larger, more violent, less educated and which consists of
an alarmingly high number of singleparent families. In short,
the system is destroying the American social fabric.
<P>
In addition to the TalentFaircloth legislation, Empower America
is supporting initiatives aimed at loosening the restrictions
on adoption (particuarly interracial adoptions), as well as initiatives
to bring economic development to the inner city through incentive
based programs. Hopefully, many in Congress will begin to see
the need for real reform and join in the fight to rescue our culture.
Until that happens, Empower America will stay on the front lines
of the fight.

<H3>Empower America Hosts San Francisco Conference</H3>
<I>Regional Meeting Draws 500 Local Activists</I>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO, CA&#151;Empower America drew over 500 local activists
to its fifth regional conference, held in San Francisco, California,
on June 1, 1994. The regional conferences are designed to engage
conference participants in an open discussion with Empower America's
Codirectors William Bennett, Jack Kemp, Jeane Kirkpatrick and
Vin Weber.
<P>
The conference focused on the future of entitlements. Panel discussions
addressed different aspects of entitlement programs ranging from
the information superhighway, to welfare policy, to the current
debate over health care reform.
<P>
The first session covered America's newest entitlement, the information
superhighway and the direction of the current administration's
technology policy. Famed author and economist George Gilder advocated
free market alternatives to President Clinton's government managed
approach to developing information technologies. Other panelists
included Larry Ellison, Chairman of the Oracle Corporation and
Tom Hazlet, a professor at the University of California at Davis
who specializes in telecommunicadons policy. A lively discussion
followed panelists' presentations in which several conference
attendees shared frustrations with a governmentrun technology
policy.
<P>
Empower America Co director William Bennett led the discussion
on welfare reform from which several suggestions were offered
by both panelists and conference participants. Addressing the
status of the welfare system, BenneK told the grassroots activists,
&quot;The current system is a complete failure. We have spent
enormous sums over the past three decades on welfare programs
and what do we have to show for it?&quot;
<P>
Jack Kemp provided the luncheon 
address entitled, 'Yhe Assault on Personal Liberty: The Clinton
Administration and the Growth of Entitlement Programs.&quot; Addressing
the recent growth and creation of entitlement programs, Kemp said,
&quot;Government- not the entrepreneur- is the centerpiece
of the Clinton economic plan. The notion that government can guide
America to prosperity is the fundamental flaw that fuels Clinton's
belief that 'government must do more.' This is wrong- individuals
must do more. The future of American prosperity depends on whether
we can roll back government's interference in our lives and allow
the entrepreneurial spirit to flourish again.&quot;
<P>
The afternoon session, chaired by Empower America's Chairman of
the Board, Malcolm S. Forbes Jr., addressed health care reform.
Forbes opened the session by airing Empower America's latest health
care television commercial which criticizes President Clinton's
nationalized health care plan. Joining Mr. Forbes in the discussion
were health care policy experts Stuart Butler of the Heritage
Foundation, Merrill Matthews, Jr. of the National Center for Policy
Analysis and Sally Pipes of the Pacific Research Institute. Each
pol
icy expert stressed the need for free market health care reforms
as opposed to government managed proposals.
<P>
Forbes criticized the Clinton administration's assumption that
individuals can't be trusted to make sensible decisions about
health care and that the only solution is a government run system.
He advocated a new health care system based on private sector
decisions and reforms, such as tax incentives like medical taxfree
savings accounts. He emphasized that individual based plans have
eliminated health care inflation, and that individuals are very
capable of making free market decisions regarding their specific
coverage needs.
<P>
Empower America's regional conferences have served to unite grassroots
activists around the country in an effort to promote the conservative
agenda of limited government. The San Francisco conference received
national media attention which has helped Empower America deliver
its message to the American people. It is this message that; Empower
America will build upon as the'se issues are discussed during
the 1994 elections. For more information about Empower America's
upcoming events, call 1-800-4-EMPOWER.

<H3>Empower America Launches Candidate Schools</H3>
<i>Seminars in Atlanta, San Francisco, Detroit, New York and other
U.S. Cities To Teach 1000 Candidates How to Run and Win on the Empowerment
Agenda</i>
<P></CENTER>
ATLANTA, GA--More than 120 candidates and campaign managers gathered
in Atlanta, Georgia March 9, 1994 to attend Empower America's
Atlanta Candidate School, the third in a series of candidate training
seminars that the political advocacy group is holding this year
in cities across the United States. The schools are designed to
help teach candidates for local, state and national offices how
to run and win on the empowerment agenda.
<P>
Candidates for offices ranging from mayor and state legislator,
to Governor, Congressman and U.S. Senator, gathered at the Atlanta
Hilton and Towers to meet with Empower America's distinguished
faculty of policy experts, elected officials and campaign consultants.
Instead of discussing campaign management, fundraising and &quot;get-out-the-vote&quot;
techniques, they attended panels on the elements of effective
welfare, education, crime and health care reform policies, and
the importance of economic growth, free trade and lower taxes.
<P>
&quot;Our schools are unique,&quot; said Empower America Vice
Chairman Vin Weber, who is heading up the candidate schools program,
&quot;because unlike most traditional candidate schools, which
teach the 'nuts and bolts' of campaigning, Empower America's schools
are focused on ideas and issues. We are teaching candidates how
to campaign effectively on the empowerment message.&quot;
<P>
The Atlanta school followed two schools hid earlier this year,
in Washington, DC on January 11th, and at Stanford University
on February 17th. Empower America will be holding candidate seminars
in cities such as Detroit, Denver, New York and a second school
in Washington, D.C.
<P>
&quot;By the time the 1994 elections come around, we expect that
some 1000 candidates for local, state and national office will
have attended our schools,&quot; said Weber. &quot;We are essentially
working with the next generation of public officials, building
a cadre of new political leaders who share our belief in the empowerment
agenda, and who will help us turn those ideas into real public
policies at all levels of government.&quot;
<P>
The Atlanta school opened with a panel discussion on economic
growth and empowerment. Mayor Tom Fetzer of Raleigh, North Carolina
discussed the growing movement towards privatization and individual
empowerment in America's inner cities. &quot;From Raleigh to Jersey
City to Indianapolis, a whole new generation of leaders is rising,&quot;
Fetzer said. &quot;These leaders represent a political view that
emphasizes the empowerment of people over government and families
and communities over spending and programs.&quot;
<P>
At lunch, Empower America Co-Director Bill Bennett suggested that
candidates for all offices emphasize a message that focuses on
returning power to people and private institutions, not on government
solutions. Cultural renewal, Bennett said, &quot;has to do with
what comes out of TV and the radio, it has to do with the composition
of families, it has to do with the health and well-being of schools,
neighborhood institutions, communities, churches and the like.
If the country is to get better, to improve, it will depend much
more on the health of those institutions than it will on the things
that government does.&quot;
<P>
Ed Goeas, President of the Tarrance Group, a leading national
potting firm, told candidates that his recent studies indicate
that &quot;the American public wants change, and they want change
that is reasonable and rational. Policies which encourage real
welfare reform, real change in education, real economic growth,
and real reductions in crime comprise the real winning platform
for 1994, 1996, and beyond.&quot;
<P>
The earlier schools drew an equally stellar faculty and were also
heavily attended. At the Washington, DC school, for example, more
than 170 candidates and campaign workers from 31 states and American
Samoa participated in panel discussions featuring House Minority
Whip Newt Gingrich, Mayor Bret Schundler of Jersey City, New Jersey,
former Attorney General William Barr, former Chief of Staff to
Vice President Quayle, Bill Kristol, and Empower America's William
Bennett, Jeane Kirkpatrick and Vin Weber. At the San Francisco
area school, more than 100 candidates participated in a program
highlighted by an address from Dr. Edward Tetter, former director
of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the &quot;father&quot;
of the H-Bomb.
<P>
During his luncheon speech, Teller urged the candidates not to
shy away from foreign policy as a campaign issue: &quot;I don't
think I need to tell you of President Clinton's mistakes in the
realm of foreign policy. In the former Soviet Union, in Yugoslavia,
in Somalia, in North Korea, in Haiti, in every continent with
the possible exception of Australia, there have been mistakes.
These mistakes should indeed be discussed because of the widespread
belief that people will vote on the economy, on family values,
and not on foreign affairs.&quot;
<P>
All candidates who attend the Candidate Schools receive Empower
America's &quot;Candidate Briefing Book,&quot; with detailed chapters
on each of the issue areas discussed at the schools. Throughout
the course of their campaigns, candidates will also receive, by
mail and fax, &quot;94 Issue Briefs,&quot; expanding on the chapters
in their briefing books, &quot;Urgent Updates&quot; giving them
information on breaking issues that might be of importance to
their campaigns, and packets of material giving them more information
on the hot issues of the 1994 campaign cycle.
<P>
Candidates or campaign managers interested in attending upcoming
candidate schools should write to: Candidate Schools (Attn: David
Kuo), Empower America, 17761 Street, NW, Suite 890, Washington,
DC 20006.

<P>
<H3>Kemp, Bennett, Weber Call GOP Welfare Bill &quot;Too Soft&quot;
Urge Republicans to Unite Behind More Aggressive Reforms</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
WASHINGTON, DC--In a move that drew wide attention in the media
and on Capitol Hill, Empower America Co-Directors Jack Kemp, William
Bennett and Vin Weber issued a memorandum April 14th, in which
they criticized the welfare reform bill backed by House Republican
leaders, and urged them to scrap the current plan and replace
it with a &quot;bold, principled and fundamentally different alternative.&quot;
<P>
The Empower America memo, released to coincide with a meeting
of GOP lawmakers to discuss their welfare reform package, sparked
coverage in several major newspapers, including The New York Times,
The Washington Times and several dozen regional dailies. In it,
the Empower America Co-Directors argued that the House Republican
bill &quot;falls short in three important areas: It contains no
serious attempt to curtail out-of-wedlock births, its work requirements
are weak, (and) its hidden costs are exorbitant.&quot;
<P>
According to Kemp, Bennett and Weber, welfare is illegitimacy's
&quot;economic lifeline.&quot; They argue that &quot;direct welfare
payments that subsidize illegitimacy must cad,&quot; and recommend
that &quot;beginning a year after the enactment of legislation,
women under 21 who have children out-of-wedlock ... be ineligible
for direct welfare payments.&quot; They also called for ending
benefit increases to women who have more children while on welfare.
<P>
In an interview with The Washington Times, Kemp stated that Republican
leaders must &quot;recognize that there has to be a more dramatic
effort at welfare reform if we are to end welfare as we know it--a
socialist, Third World trap permanently subsidizing dependency.&quot;
<P>
&quot;It would be irresponsible and politically unwise for Republicans
to assist the President in perpetuating welfare reform that is
too costly and too soft on illegitimacy and work requirements,&quot;
he said.
<P>
&quot;The central issue is people having babies out of wedlock,&quot;
said Bennett, in an interview with the Associated Press. &quot;Babies
are coming into this world with no fathers and ill-prepared mothers.
It adds to the welfare rolls, education problems and criminal
problems. It adds to the social breakdown of this country. We
have seen enough of the carnage, the cruelty, the 19 kids living
in the (Chicago) tenement, the babies left in dumpsters.&quot;
<P>
Asked what the goal of the Republican alternative legislation
should be, Weber, a retired Member of Congress and former House
GOP Conference Secretary, said that Republicans should frame their
welfare reform plan in a way that &quot;stops President Clinton
from passing a phony welfare proposal that sounds tough, but really
does nothing to bring about fundamental reform.&quot; The GOP
leadership, Weber said, must &quot;prevent passage of a bad welfare
reform package by using their plan to show just how bad the Clinton
bill is, and to force improvement.

<H3>Empower America Economic Summit Findings: Jobs Deficit Is Nation's No. 1 Economic Problem</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
WASHINGTON, DC--America's number one economic problem is not the
budget deficit, but the nation's 5.4 million jobs deficit, according
to testimony delivered at Empower America's recent national economic
summit. Held in Washington, DC, December 14, 1994 exactly one
year after President Clinton's Little Rock Economic Summit, the
Empower America meeting brought together some of the nation's
leading economists, entrepreneurs and business leaders to assess
the state of the economy one year into the Clinton Administration,
and to develop pro-growth alternatives to Clintonomics. The goal
of the economic conference was to assess past and present economic
policies, and to propose an alternative growth plan for the economy.
<P>
In his presentation, Lawrence Kudlow, a noted economist and Empower
America board member, argued that ever since Congress voted to
raise the tax on capital gains from 20 percent to 28 percent in
1986, our nation's economic growth has fallen dramatically below
historic trendlines. This has cost America 1.3 million new businesses,
and has created a 5.4 million jobs deficit--the difference between
the jobs that should have been created and those that actually
were.
<P>
This jobs deficit is being created, according to testimony given
during the conference, because the largest job creator in the
country--the American entrepreneur--has been under continual assault
in the 1990's from higher taxes, more government red tape, and
diminishing incentives to risk-taking.
<P>
Chief among the problems with &quot;Clintonomics&quot; identified
at the conference is the Clinton Administration's core belief
that government is the most important actor in the economy. The
risk-taking entrepreneur is the most important actor in the economy,
argued Kudlow, not government. &quot;Far more important is the
individual man or woman, driven by a dream or an idea--the person
who is willing to sacrifice everything, to mortgage the home or
borrow from the family, friends and neighbors to start a new business.
So any true economic growth model must place the individual, the
investor and the entrepreneur at the center of the economic equation.&quot;
Kudlow said.
<P>
Kudlow argued that a direct link exists between several critical
economic policy mistakes and the plunge in entrepreneurial activity
in the country over the past eight years. The policies that have
caused this decline in job creation, which he compiled into a
list called &quot;The Assault on Capital Formation &amp; Growth,&quot;
include:
<P>
<ul>
<li> 1986 Capital Gains Tax Hike (20% to 28%),
<P>
<li> 1986-90 Social Security Payroll Tax Hikes (14.1% to 15.3%)
<P>
<li> 1989-91 Regulatory Reign of Terror owl bank credit
<P>
<li> 1990 Tax Bill
<P>
- Income tax hike (28% to 31%) and temporary phaseout of itemized
deductions and personal exemptions
<P>
- Alternative Minimum Tax hike (to 24&#162;)
<P>
- Luxury and business tax hikes
<P>
<li> 1991-1992 Regulatory Mandates
<P>
- Clean Air, Americans with Disabilities, and Civil Rights Acts
<P>
<li> 1993 Tax Bill
<P>
- Income tax hike (31% to 39.6%) and permanent phaseout of itemized
deductions and personal exemptions - Medicare tax cap eliminated
(2.9% tax rate) - Corporate tax hike (34% to 35%) and other business
tax hikes including entertainment deduction limits from 80% to
50%) - Other tax hikes: Alternative Minimum I Tax (24% to 28%),
Gas Tax Hike, Taxation of Social Security income.
</ul>
<P>
As a result of these higher taxes, business start-ups since 1986
have dropped dramatically below the historic trend costing millions
of jobs (see accompanying chart). According to Kudlow, &quot;When
taxes were low in the 1980's, we surged above the (historic) trendline
for business startups. Since 1986, as capital was taxed and incentives
diminished, we've fallen sharply below the trend, creating a 1.6
million business start-up deficit&quot; and the 5.4 million new
jobs that should have been created, but never were. Kudlow argued
that if the U.S. continues to &quot;strangle entrepreneurial activity,
America will find itself with European-like economic stagnation
and rising unemployment.&quot;
<P>
Also addressing the conference were Empower America Co-Director
Jack Kemp, Empower America board member Malcolm S. Forbes, Ir.,
and House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-GA), who argued that
closing this jobs deficit required the creation of entrepreneurial
incentives through lower taxes on capital investments and income.
Gingrich took the Clinton health care plan to task, arguing that
the Clinton plan is an anti-capitalist proposal &quot;designed
to seize control of the health system and centralize power in
Washington.&quot;
<P>
The conference was aired live, gavel-to-gavel, by C-SPAN and covered
by both CNN and CBS, which broadcast Empower America's message
to millions of viewers across the nation. It was also covered
in 167 newspapers in 37 states, reaching well over 10 million
people. Since the conference, Empower America has been flooded
with requests for transcripts and videos of the event. To accommodate
this demand, Empower America has made available a 60 minute video
presentation covering the conference.

<H3>Simon &amp; Schuster Publishes Bennett's Index of Leading Cultural Indicators</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>

WASHINGTON, DC--With the tremendous response last year to Empower
America Co-Director William Bennett's release of his Index of
Leading Cultural Indicators, Simon &amp; Schuster has released
the ground breaking study of our culture in book form. The new
book, published under the Touchstone Books insignia, is a significantly
enhanced version of the original Index, with new and updated data
on a wide range of cultural indicators.
<P>
The new Index is the most comprehensive statistical portrait available
of social and behavioral trends over the last 30 years. It consists
of five chapters: Crime; Family and Children; Youth Pathologies
and Behavior, Education; Popular Culture and Religion; along with
appendices on social spending and various economic indicators.
The cultural index is based on the government's &quot;Index of
Leading Economic Indicators,&quot; a set of statistics which track
the health of the nation's economy. The Index of Leading Cultural
Indicators is designed to provide a similar window into the state
of our nation's cultural health.
<P>
Unlike the first edition of the Index, this edition contains extensive
factual analysis of our current cultural condition, with commentaries
by experts and commissions that interpret and provide perspective
on the raw data.
<P>
Among the key findings: Over the past three decades there has
been a 560 percent rise in violent crime, a 400-plus percent increase
in illegitimate births, a quadrupling of divorce rates, a tripling
of the percentage of teenagers living in poverty.

<H3>Recent Visitors to Empower America:  Dr. Edward Teller, Father of H-Bomb, Criticizes Clinton-Gore Defense, Technology Policies</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
WASHINGTON, DC--Dr. Edward Teller, father of the H-Bomb and one
of this century's greatest minds, visited Empower America, March
29, 1994 to meet with Empower America's staff and offer his perspective
on the Clinton administration's defense and technology policies.
America, Teller warned, is in a critical state of transition,
and the current administration is making serious policy mistakes
that he-said &quot;could lead to-very great trouble ... (and)
must be corrected &quot;
<P>
Teller specifically criticized Vice President Gore, who has taken
the lead in the administration on technology issues. Teller said
that Gore has been moving America from being a &quot;progressive
country&quot; into a &quot;reactionary country&quot; in terms
of its receptivity to new technologies.
<P>
&quot;When I came to this country in 1935 everything new was good,&quot;
Teller remarked.
<P>
&quot;Now everything new is under suspicion.&quot; As an example,
Teller cited the Clinton administration's gutting of the Strategic
Defense Initiative (SDI). &quot;The Strategic Defense Initiative
is new and is good,&quot; Teller said. &quot;I don't see any argument
that would say otherwise. But in the book of Al Gore, SDI is a
form of aggression.&quot;
<P>
Teller argued that, with the rapid spread of technology throughout
the world, America's era of isolation and invulnerability is over.
&quot;America is no longer isolated. America today is as vulnerable
as Poland was at the outbreak of the Second World War, or even
more vulnerable.... Today Iran or Iraq could put a missile loaded
with biological material on a ship and deliver it from a distance
of ten miles to New York or Los Angles and actually kill 50 thousand
people,&quot; Teller said.
<P>
Teller further added that, while the danger of attack from small
hostile powers which are rapidly acquiring nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons, is less awesome than that once posed by the
Soviet Union, it is also much more likely to occur. The danger
today, Teller said, is &quot;not as terrible as the danger (was)
from the threat of the Soviet Union during the Cold War --that
was a much bigger but much less probable danger. Now we have dangers
that are smaller but more probable.&quot;
<P>
But Teller argued that, despite the dangers posed by rapidly expanding
access to technology, government should not try to stop or interfere
with the progress of technology. &quot;We scientists are responsible
to find the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth,
so far as we can; including potentialities, what can be done,
and how to use it,&quot; he said. &quot;It is not to be determined
by any elite, not by the religious community, not by the scientific
community and not by the political community, except to the extent
that the political community is an honest representative of the
people.&quot;
<P>
In fact, Teller expressed his support for the &quot;very widespread,
very thorough declassification of information&quot; which the
Clinton administration has recently proposed, because he said
that this declassification would encourage public understanding.
Public understanding, he said, is the only way to combat fear.
<P>
But he also emphasized the potential dangers of such declassification,
and cautioned that it not be misused. &quot;While general principles
and ideas can't be kept secret,&quot; he added, &quot;detailed
blue-prints and precise weapons procedures can be kept secret
and in some cases they should be.&quot; Limited access to this
information does not interfere with increasing public understanding,
he explained.
<P>
Teller said that instead of teaching people to fear technology,
or controlling technological advances, government should harness
technology to protect us. The United States, he insisted, must
use the technological know-how at its disposal to develop defenses
aimed at protecting the lives of its citizens.

<H3>Empower America Interview: David Kay Former Chief of U.N. Nuclear Inspection Team in Iraq Discusses North Korea,Emerging Threats to American Security</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>

In 1991, following the United States' successful prosecution of
the Persian Gulf War, the United Nations sent a team of nuclear
arms inspectors to Iraq to enforce Saddam Hussein's compliance
with the terms of surrender and supervise the dismantling of Iraq's
nuclear, chemical and biological weapons programs. What the U.N.
team found was horrifying--unbeknownst to the West, Iraq was less
than 18 months away from &quot;going nuclear.&quot; For the next
several months, Iraq played a cat-and-mouse game with the U.N.,
trying to hide and preserve as much of its nuclear capability
as possible.
<P>
David Kay led the U.N. team that discovered Iraq's nuclear program,
and stood down Saddam Hussein's Republican Guard when they tried
to forcibly prevent him from bringing proof of that program to
international attention. An eminent authority on nuclear proliferation
and national security issues, David Kay recently spoke to Empower
America about the current nuclear stand-off with North Korea and
the new threats to American security emerging in the post-Cold
War world.
<P>
Empower America: The conventional wisdom today seems to be that,
with the Soviet threat gone, America will face no major threats
to its national security in me foreseeable future. Do you agree?
If not, what are the emerging threats to our security in the post-Cold
War world?
<P>
David Kay: No, I do not agree. While the Cold War held the potential
for the destruction of our society as we know it --and we are
clearly better for its end-- the Soviets and the U.S. also had
forty years to learn to manage the Cold War in ways that limited
the likelihood of direct nuclear conflict. Today we are witnessing
the emergence of states and groups that are quite unrestrained
in their hostility to the West and willing to run what to most
Americans must seem like irrational risks to advance their interests.
Saddam Hussein's massive miscalculation in the Gulf and North-Korea's
dash for nuclear arms are but two examples of this new development.
<P>
The United States now towers above all others as the only state
in the world with the power to restrain the lust for domination
of renegade states and radical ethnic movements. It is inevitable
that these states will seek to threaten us and diminish our willingness
to stand in the way of their ambitions. Further, even under the
best of circumstances, the vast Soviet nuclear arsenal will take
more than twenty years to dismantle. In the worst of circumstances
some of the former Soviet nuclear, chemical and biological weapons
could well leak into the hands of states and groups hostile to
the U.S. or become the tools of a resurgent Russian dictatorship.
<P>
EA: How soon do you believe it will be before hostile states like
Iran and North Korea are able to directly threaten the continental
U.S. with nuclear or biological weapons?
<P>
DK: North Korea probably already has the capability to threaten
the U.S. with the terrorist use of biological weapons. Biological
weapons have undergone a largely unpublicized revolution in their
lethality and ease of production, and the Director of the CIA
has recently testified that two dozen states have active biological
weapons programs. North Korea's long range missile program is
surging ahead at a rate well ahead of estimates of only two years
ago. I would not be surprised to see North Korea, particularly
if its missile program is assisted by unemployed Russian experts,
able to field an intercontinental missile that could strike the
United States during the mid-part of the next decade. Well before
then it will be able to threaten U.S. bases in Japan and Guam.
Cruise missile technology provides an even easier path than intercontinental
missiles to reach the continental U.S. from ships off our coast,
and this threat will almost certainly be with us by the end of
this decade. The Iranians have already benefited from North Korean
military expertise, and it is reasonable to assume that North
Korea will continue to sell weapons and technology to all bidders.
<P>
EA: What can the U S. do to prepare for this eventuality? Where
should we be directing our resources today, in terms of defense
and intelligence spending?
<P>
DK: First, every effort should be made to slow and disrupt the
advanced weapons programs and cooperation between states such
as North Korea and Iran. While general export controls of the
type that were applied against the Soviet Union during the height
of the Cold War are no longer practical, it is possible to maintain
highly targeted controls on exports and technology assistance
against rogue states such as these. We should do this and be sure
that our allies and states such as China and Russia that want
to benefit from Western trade and assistance do so as well.
<P>
Second, we must develop the capability and political will to destroy
their leadership and political society if they threaten their
neighbors. While we are rightfully proud of the accomplishments
of the coalition military forces in the Gulf, the fact is that
poor intelligence and the lack of suitable weapons for penetrating
deep underground bunkers allowed much of Iraq's military might
to escape attack.
<P>
And finally, we must develop a credible defense capacity able
to handle the most likely threats to American forces abroad and
our people at home. By the end of the decade, we must either have
a workable cruise missile defense and the ability to intercept
a small number of long range missiles aimed at the continental
U.S. or be prepared to accept intimidating military threats to
our society.
<P>
EA: What is at stake with the crisis In North Korea today? Why
should Americans be concerned about North Korea's nuclear program,
and why is it In our national interest to stop it?
<P>
DK: Without a doubt the most dangerous place in the world today
is the Korean peninsula. Within 60 miles on each side of the Demilitarized
Zone (DMZ) that marked the end of the Korean War, approximately
37,000 American troops, 600,000 South Korean and upwards of one
million North Korea troops face each other. The North Korean regime
of aging Kim Il-Sung and his son, Kim Jong-II, rule over an impoverished,
isolated relic of Communism which, if it were not for its military
might and its craftily constructed Image of unpredictability and
irrationality could be ignored until it collapsed into the footnotes
of history.
<P>
But the military might of North Korea is real. Its army is equipped
with Russian, Chinese and Korean-improved armaments that make
up in sheer numbers what they may lack in Gulf War-type quality
and precision. It also fields a battlefield rocket force capable
of reigning, with almost no warning, terror on the South's capital
of Seoul and U.S. bases in the South. Its recent testing of the
Rodong I missile with a range of at least 600 miles now brings
large areas of Japan into range. And most frightening of all,
the U.S. intelligence community is widely reported to have concluded that North Korea has deployed one or two nuclear devices from plutonium
illegally diverted from its IAEA safeguarded reactors. So nuclear
arms must now be added to the regime's armory of chemical and
biological weapons of mass destruction.
<P>
Beyond the fate of South Korea lies the reaction of other Asian
states who have grown used to leaving to the U.S. the management
of regional security concerns. The Japanese may well view the
outcome of a U.S. policy that leaves them to live with a North
Korean bomb as just the opening move in the inevitable retreat
of U.S. power and political influence from Asia. Allowing North
Korea to cheat its way into possession of nuclear weapons could
easily bring an end to this stability and open the way to a less
safe, less open Asia. In this case, foreign policy does matter
even if you believe, &quot;it's the economy, stupid.&quot;
<P>
EA: What is your assessment of the Clinton Administration's approach
to the crisis in North Korea thus far? Is the U.S. approach today
making a conflict more, or less likely' What should the Administration
be doing differently?
<P>
DK: North Korea's nuclear bomb program has faced this Administration
with a set of circumstances that must seem to them depressingly
familiar:
<ul>
<li> Presidential rhetoric has set out a policy that on reflection
the Administration has neither the will nor the ability to implement
and now must find a way to abandon.
<P>
<li> US allies are unwilling to support the announced position of
the President.
<P>
<li> The existing intelligence committee and military capabilities
inherited from the Cold War are inadequate to either implement
the President's policy or to cope with the failure to implement
it.
<P>
<li> Even the best of what are now viewed as possible outcomes, leaves
the US hostage to the actions of irrational, unpredictable leaders
of a regime that has demonstrated implacable hostility to our
ally, South Korea, and to the U.S.
</ul>
<P>
But the allocation of blame should be the least of our concerns
now. There are three important steps that must be taken soon to
ensure that the least possible damage results from the situation:
<P>
First, the U.S. decision must clearly convey to North Korea that
any use by them of weapons of mass destruction, whether they be
chemical, biological or nuclear, would immediately result in the
annihilation of their society. If this is not to be dismissed
as just more overheated U.S. rhetoric then the forces that would
implement this policy must be visibly put in place. If we are
going to have to learn to live with a North Korean bomb, then
we must make it clear to the North Koreans that the use of any
of their arsenal-of weapons of mass destruction would mean the
end of the history of their political leadership. To live with
a North Korean bomb is to live with a regime that has cheated
and won. We will discover that the task of ensuring that victory
does not feed the North Korean appetite requires a toughness of
policy and resolution that has not yet been seen in Washington.
<P>
Second, the inadequacies in U.S. intelligence and military posture
which left the Administration with only a series of bad options
for eliminating the North Korean program must be put right. Proliferation
has already occurred, and North Korea will not be the last case.
The highest priority must be finding effective defensive measures.
As the Administration has discovered, it is impossible to build
a coalition in favor of standing up to a nuclear cheat when the
cost of doing so involves the destruction of one's own country.
Unless we can provide our forces and our allies with meaningful
defenses against missiles and aircraft, the prospect of controlling
proliferation will become much more difficult.
<P>
Third, we must make it clear that North Korea will not be allowed
to export its military technology to others. If North Korea will
not accept effective international inspection and controls on
its nuclear program (and this seems clearly unlikely), and if
the Administration is unwilling to run the risk of a war on the
Korean peninsula to eliminate the North's nuclear capability (and
this seems clear despite occasional Presidential rhetoric to the
contrary), then it is incumbent that we and our allies use our
individual and collective rights to ensure that all of the North's
attempts to export this capability are interdicted.
<P>
EA: You led the weapons inspection effort in Iraq after the Gulf
war which uncovered Saddam Hussein's advanced nuclear program.
What lessons can you draw from your experience in Iraq for how
the Administration should approach North Korea?
<P>
DK: The clearest lesson from Iraq is that the world is better
off to intervene before a rogue state acquires a nuclear capability
than to deal with such a state after it has acquired even a crude
nuclear capability. Korea is in many ways a tougher case than
Iraq. The North is capable of inflicting truly horrible damage
on South Korea with little or no warning. Our closest ally in
the region, Japan, can now be reached by missiles from the North.
While our ability to make the North pay a high price for any such
attack remains, we have little if any ability to truly defend
against such a blow and prevent massive damage to allies and significant
American casualties. Korea, like Saddam's Iraq is a revolutionary
state bent upon overturning the regional order. It is wrong to
assume that we share common objectives with such states and that
more or better negotiations will lead to an acceptable solution
that will provide long-term stability. North Korea under its present
leadership will not play a constructive part in a stable and prosperous
Asia. Our policy should be directed toward containing the destructive
forces of North Korea while waiting for the inherent destructive
forces of the failed regime to bring about its own collapse.
<P>
EA: Can the spread of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons
be stopped, or is their proliferation inevitable?
<P>
DK: Every effort should be made to limit the further spread of
these weapons. But regardless of how vigorous such efforts are,
I believe that further significant proliferation is inevitable.
It is therefore vitally important to ensure that U.S. forces and
our allies are able to defend themselves against the use of such
weapons. We must make clear to any rogue state that the United
States cannot be intimidated from protecting its vital interests
by their possession or use of such weapons. If these states come
to believe --and this is the long-range danger of the situation
in North Korea--that nuclear, chemical or biological weapons would
stop the U.S. from protecting our allies and our own interests,
then the forces of proliferation would become unstoppable. The
most effective nonproliferation policy would be rooted in a vigorous
U.S. military capability to operate and advance our foreign policy
objectives in the face of such weapons.

WASHINGTON, DC--Empower America announced that two of the nation's
most respected economists, Lawrence Kudlow and Judy Shelton, and
one of America's leading entrepreneurs, Jamie Coulter, have joined
the organization's Board of Directors.
<P>
Mr. Kudlow, former Chief Economist with Bear Stearns, served as
Associate Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
in President Reagan's first term, and was one of the principal
architects of the Reagan Administration's economic and budget
policy. Most recently, Mr. Kudlow served as Co-Chairman of the
Economic Recovery Council in New Jersey Governor Christine Todd
Whitman's election campaign, where he co-developed the tax cut
plan that helped Whitman win the 1993 race against incumbent Governor
Jim Florio.
<P>
Dr. Shelton is currently a Senior Research Fellow at the Hoover
Institution at Stanford University, and is one of the nation's
foremost experts on international monetary, financial and economic
policy. She is the author of several highly-acclaimed books, including
1989's prophetic The Coming Soviet Crash (which was translated
into German and Italian), and the forthcoming Money Meltdown,
to be published by the Free Press in April of 1994.
<P>
Mr. Coulter, Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President of
Lonestar Steakhouse and Saloon, Inc. since 1992, is one of the
nation's most successful entrepreneurs.
<P>
He has been responsible for developing and operating more than
250 restaurants throughout the United States. And, under the umbrella
of companies he controls, more than 8,000 people are employed
in 30 states. He has served as Chairman of the Board of Directors
of the Young Presidents Organization, Chairman of the Venice International
University of Leadership, and as a Member of the Board of Advisors
of the Wichita State University Center for Entrepreneurship.
<P>
&quot;Larry Kudlow, Judy Shelton and Jamie Coulter bring a wealth
of experience to Empower America,&quot; said Chairman Malcolm
S. Forbes, Jr. &quot;They will play a crucial role in helping
us develop progrowth alternatives to the Clinton economic agenda,
and to champion policies that encourage entrepreneurship, create
jobs and expand opportunity for all Americans.&quot;

<H3>Following Washington State Vote, &quot;Three Strikes, You're
Out&quot; Initiatives Gaining National Attention</H3>
<i>Empower America Was Early Supporter of the Innovative Anti-Crime Proposal</i>
</CENTER>
<p>


WASHINGTON, D C - Last November, when voters in Washington state
passed Prop. 593, the &quot;Three Strikes, You're Out&quot; and-crime
initiative, they had no idea they were starting a national movement.
But since the historic vote, in which the ground-breaking initiative
won by a margin of more than 3-to-1, versions of the Washington
state &quot;Three Strikes&quot; law have been proposed across
the country, at both the federal and state level, drawing support
from both Democrats and Republicans alike.
<P>
Empower America was one of the earliest active supporters of the
Three Strikes idea, which would place criminals convicted of their
third violent felony in jail for life, no chance of parole. Co-Director
William Bennett -- campaigned in Washington state on behalf of
the initiative, making public appearances, publishing op-eds in
favor of the proposal, conducting interviews with local media
and preparing taped radio &quot;actualities&quot; supporting the
initiative. &quot;When this thing passes,&quot; Bennett argued
during the campaign, &quot;a lot of other states are going to
do the same thing. We do not have a health crisis in this country.
We do have a violent crime crisis.&quot;
<P>
Bennett's prediction has come to pass. Since Washington state
passed Three Strikes in November, legislation has been introduced
in Washington, DC, and as many as thirty states are considering
Three Strikes proposals. An initiative process is underway in
California to place a Three Strikes measure on the 1994 ballot;
legislation was passed last March in California to require a life
prison term with no chance of parole for 25 years for third-time
felons convicted of two violent crimes. Governor Mario Cuomo (D-NY)
has indicated support for legislation involving Three Strikes-type
provisions, and even President Clinton stated his support for
Three Strikes measures for federal crimes during his State of
the Union address this January. Some leaders, such as Gov. Zell
Miller (D-GA), have even claimed that three strikes are too many.
Miller has called for a two strikes and life law.
<P>
The Three Strikes law is intended to target the small group of
repeat offenders who commit the vast majority of violent crimes.
Studies indicate that less than 10 percent of all criminals commit
some two-thirds of all crimes.
<P>
The popularity of the Three Strikes proposal stems from the growing
concern many Americans have about the safety of their communities.
Recent national polls have shown that Americans consider crime
the number one issue facing the country, and politicians have
responded to this sentiment by proposing a number of &quot;tough
on crime&quot; initiatives, both in Washington, DC and in the
states. In addition to the various Three Strikes proposals, both
Florida and Oregon are gathering signatures to put initiatives
on the 1994 ballot which have truth in sentencing provisions prohibiting
the early release of prisoners. The Florida initiative would ensure
that prisoners serve at least 85 percent of their sentence.
<P>
Critics of Three Strikes proposals raise the cost of incarceration
as an issue. But while the average annual cost to incarcerate
an inmate is $25,000, the Bureau of Justice Statistics estimates
that the average annual cost to society of allowing a career criminal
to roam free is $430,000. Thus, the costs of keeping criminals
on the streets and out of prison is much more significant than
the cost of keeping them in prison.
<P>
Critics also cite the discrepancy in the severity of crimes covered
by the law. The initiative passed in Washington state includes
40 crimes as violent crimes, a list which some view as too long.
Critics also argue that the Washington law does not provide rules
to prove Three Strikes, an omission which is likely to set off
a Constitutional challenge.
<P>
Whatever the outcome, the Three Strikes idea has gained significant
popular support in the current and-crime climate. Three Strikes
proposals signify a tough, realistic approach to crime and get
multiple offenders off the streets and into prison where they
belong.

<H3>Issue Briefing</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>
<b>The Clinton Health Care Plan: The Making of a Crisis</b>
<P>
There is an emerging consensus that the current health care debate
is perhaps the most consequential domestic public policy debate
in recent American history. The stakes are so high because of
what the 1,364 page Health Security Act, reduced to its essence,
represents: a power-grab by the federal government that is unprecedented
in its scope, its dimensions and its political ambition.
<P>
As the health care debate proceeds, it is important that we establish
a clear concept of what constitutes (and what does not constitute)
real victory by advocates of responsible health care reform. We
believe, for example, that the defeat of the Clinton health care
plan would be an unambiguously good thing. But we also believe
that the passage of a modified version of the plan or an &quot;alternative&quot;
plan which accepts many of the flawed premises of the Clinton
plan--the Chafee plan and the Cooper-Grandy proposal come immediately
to mind--is unacceptable because they, too, would inflict real
long-term damage on the country. In sum: many of the &quot;alternatives&quot;
to the Administration's health care proposals are merely distinctions
without essential philosophical differences. Their passage would
result in a ratcheting leftward--a steady, incremental march toward
statism and collectivism. And so they, too, need to be opposed.
<P>
The good news is that a thoughtful, humane, and essentially conservative
reform of the health care system is now within the realm of legislative
possibility. Opponents of the Clinton plan should therefore resist
the calls for premature capitulation or accommodation and build
on the momentum for intelligent reform. At the same time, we need
to provide a coherent philosophical framework by which to judge
various proposals--to better establish in the public mind what
we believe should be central, and what we believe is unacceptable,
to any health care reform. . .
<P>
<b>Crime and Punishment in America</b><P>
...Crime is one of the most important issues facing America. Government's
first responsibility is the protection of its citizens from &quot;all
enemies, foreign and domestic.&quot; Those who terrorize the lives
of law abiding citizens are, by any measure, enemies; citizens
deserve protection against them. Unfortunately, under our current
system, crime often pays; high crime rates reflect this. The odds
need to be changed back in society's favor.
<P>
The Solution: Incarcerate prisoners, build more prisons and correctional
institutions, enforce prison sentences, increase the police force,
focus on juvenile crime, reduce illegitimacy...
<P>
<b>School Choice</b>
<P>
...The current system is harmful to students and undermines parental
authority. The American people sense this: more than 70 percent
of Americans support school voucher systems, and as of 1992, thirty-four
states had some form of choice legislation pending or introduced.
Increasingly, even teachers and education bureaucrats lack faith
in the system they defend--22 percent send their children to private
schools, for example, and the number is far higher in urban school
districts. The widespread support for school choice is part of
the &quot;parents' rights movement,&quot; in this case an attempt
by parents to regain control from an education bureaucracy that
has stripped individual schools of their autonomy and incentives
to meet student needs.
<P>
School vouchers would provide all parents--regardless of income
level--with an equal opportunity to secure a quality education
for their child. If parents are pleased with the public school
their child attends, as many parents will be, the voucher will
simply stay with that school. If they are not, parents now have
a choice --they can send their child elsewhere, to another public
school, or to a private or religious school. This is the same
concept we use in higher education; students can use government
grants and loans to attend the University of Indiana, or Notre
Dame, or Yeshiva University...
<P>
<b>Clinton's SDI Cuts imperil America</b>
<P>
(Prepared exclusively for Empower America by Henry F. Cooper,
former Chief Negotiator at the Geneva Defense and Space Talks
and the first civilian SDI Director)
<P>
...In 10 years with $30 billion, the Strategic Defense Initiative
(SDI) made dramatic technical advances enabling the deployment
of systems to protect the United States, our troops abroad, and
our friends and allies from ballistic missile attack. The 1991
Gulf War demonstrated the importance of defending civilians against
missile attack, and Congress directed that advanced defenses be
developed for deployment as soon as technology permitted. The
Bush administration left a fully funded plan, approved by a comprehensive
Pentagon acquisition review, with options to deploy advanced defenses
for our troops, friends and allies as early as 1996 and for the
American homeland as early as 1999. After Clinton's first year,
what remains is barely a shadow of the Reagan-Bush SDI legacy.
<P>
The Bush plan to protect the American homeland against limited
missile attack by as early as 1999 called for 5-times the Clinton
budget, which aspires only to support a &quot;technology readiness
program.&quot; The Bush plan included 60 percent more for advanced
technology to assure that America excels at the very competitive
edge of the technology frontier. The Clinton cuts severely constrain
efforts to respond to reactive threats that will follow from the
inevitable measure-countermeasure competition--and will stop development
of new technologies...
<P>
<b>Goals 2000</b>
<P>
...President Clinton's $420 million education bill, Goals 2000,
falls far short of the mark of qualifying as education reform,
and provides for no real change such as more choices, greater
accountability, more
<P>
local control and flexibility to teachers. Instead, the bill contains
a number of &quot;business as usual&quot; options as well as a
number of potentially harmful provisions. Unfortunately, the Clinton
Education Department receives its marching orders from the education
establishment, which has opposed every meaningful education reform
proposal during the past 20 years. The establishment is largely
responsible for engineering the worst decline in the history of
American education. And they are now in the posit ~~n of defending
one of the worst-performing systems in the world.
<P>
Our education system needs entrepreneurial reform. Here's what
that might look like: reform measures providing for accountability,
decentralization, national standards in the core subjects, merit
pay, alternative certification, and allowing parents to choose
the public, private or religious school to
<P>
which they send their children. These proposals, if implemented,
would dramatically improve American education. . .

<H3>Bennett's <I>Book of Virtues Reaches</I> Nation's Best Seller
List</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>

WASHINGTON, DC--Empower America Co-Director William J. Bennett's
<I>The Book of Virtues</I> has reached number one on the national
best-seller lists, including those complied by The New York Times,
The Los Angles Times, and The Washington Post. The book, an anthology
of great moral stones, focuses on ten virtues: self-discipline,
compassion, responsibility, friendship, work, courage, perseverance,
honesty, loyalty and faith. The purpose of the collection, Bennett
writes in his introduction, is &quot;to aid in the time-honored
task of the moral education of the young.&quot;
<P>
The book has proved not only a popular success, but a critical
success as well. It has received rave reviews in both the general
press and opinion journals from across the political spectrum,
including <I>Newsweek, Time, People, The Washington Post, The
Wall Street Journal, The New Republic, National Review</I>, and
<I>Commentary</I>.
<P>
However, despite the wide attention it has received, Bennett is
quick to emphasize that <I>The Book of Virtues</I>, was in no
way animated by politics. &quot;I commit a lot of political acts,&quot;
he recently told the Associated Press. &quot;This book was not
a political act.&quot; In a recent essay, Time magazine columnist
Lance Morrow echoed this sentiment, writing: &quot;Bennett is
not demagoguing the verities. He anthologies the old republic
and the old virtues, but he addresses virtue at a level of commonality
that is deeper than politics or nostalgia.&quot;
<P>
Perhaps what is most encouraging about the success of <I>The Book
of Virtues</I> is what it may say about changes in our culture.
The book's popularity seems an expression of the American people'
s desire to hear again --and to read again --about time honored
virtues. As U.S. News &amp; World Report put it in a recent article,
&quot;the Public longing for moral anchors helps to explain how
William Bennett's anthology ... was able to push shock-jock Howard
Stern's autobiography from the top of the bestseller list earlier
this year.&quot; Asked why he feels these moral tales have struck
a chord with the American public, Bennett answers simply: &quot;Unless
you're a criminal, these are your values.&quot;

<H3>EMPOWER AMERICA IN THE NEWS</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>

In addition to coverage in the national media, Empower America
also generates a great deal of coverage in the local and regional
press. Here is a sample of recent news stories that discuss Empower
America.
<P>
&quot;Empower America, a conservative organization, said Clinton's
(State of the Union) speech had one purpose: 'to resuscitate his
faltering health care plan,' which it said 'has steadily been
losing support with the American people.' 'He has manufactured
a phony health care 'crisis' to scare people into accepting his
plan to nationalize the health care industry,' said the group,
led by former Housing Secretary Jack Kemp and other conservatives.&quot;
<P>
--<I>San Jose Mercury News</I>, January 26, 1994
<P>
&quot;Many conservatives say Clinton's (health reform) plan is
a liberal power grab based on the illusion that there is a health
care crisis. 'The crisis will come only if the Clinton plan becomes
law,' said a press release Tuesday from Empower America The White
House responded to such criticism with offers to back off some
of its more ambitious goals...&quot;
<P>
--<I>Orlando Sentinel</I>, January 26, 1994
<P>
&quot;William Bennett--the former education secretary and drug
czar under the Reagan and Bush administrations--called for an
end to welfare, saying it fosters the dissolution of low-income
families. He advocated instead programs to strengthen the family.
He said polling data shows a change in values in America that
has worsened the crime crisis, with few modern parents looking
at their children as their most important priority. 'We have conducted
a social experiment in the last 30 years in this country along
these lines--what happens if we have lots of children and don't
raise them?' said Bennett. 'The results of that experiment are
now in.&quot;'
<P>
--<I>Pensacola News-Journal</I>, January 20, 1994
<P>
&quot;Former U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick ... took Clinton
to task, saying his just-concluded trip to Russia and Eastern
Europe was a pullback of the historic U.S. commitment. 'The U.S.
performance was largely interpreted as a retreat,' said Kirkpatrick.
Kirkpatrick ... (was) in Miami for the third regional meeting
of the new organization, Empower America.&quot;
<P>
--<I>Palm Beach Post</I>, January 20, 1994
<P>
&quot;During his visit to Miami Wednesday ... Kemp says his organization
(Empower America) is reshaping the party. He called Clinton's
foreign policy in general 'a disaster' and U.S. policies in both
Bosnia and North Korea 'an empty shell.' As for the problem of
ending the cycle of poverty in American cities, 'President Clinton
doesn't have a clue.' 'We've turned our cities into socialized,
almost Third World economies,' he said. Kemp shared the podium
with Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., former U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick,
and former Education Secretary and war-on-drugs czar William Bennett
....&quot;
<P>
-- <I>The Miami Herald</I>, January 16, 1994
<P>
&quot;Jack Kemp ... blasted the Administration's first year as
a failure in foreign policy .... 'The President's administration
has been close to a disaster in terms of credibility,&quot; Kemp
said Wednesday. Kemp ... Ridiculed Clinton for allowing 'a bunch
of thugs with AK47 submachineguns' to force a U.S. Navy warship
to leave Haiti. He criticized Clinton for being too soft on North
Korea's nuclear threat, and said the administration has fumbled
the Bosnia crisis with its inaction.&quot;
<P>
--<I>Marietta Daily Journal</I>, January 20, 1994
<P>
&quot;Vin Weber, Co-Director of Empower America ... (noted) that
the version of the (balanced budget) amendment sponsored by Senator
Paul Simon, D-Ill., that is being debated on the Senate floor
would make tax cuts designed to stimulate economic growth unlikely,
largely because any tax cut would be seen as adding to the deficit.

<B>&quot;A Cultural Renaissance&quot;</B> 
<P>
By Jack Kemp, Co-Director, Empower America, delivered at Hillsdale College
<P>
...A government conceived in liberty has none of the tools of
tyranny. It depends, instead, on other institutions-- structures
between the individual and the state--that instill character,
purpose, and virtue. Churches and synagogues that raise a moral
standard. Parents who provide a moral and spiritual example to
their children. Schools that teach, not only the basics of math
and history, but the basics of citizenship and character that
come from an understanding of the Decalogue as well as the Declaration
of Independence.
<P>
Can we separate economics and values? The choice is not necessary.
The achievements of capitalism depend on the achievements of the
human spirit, nurtured in families. I am a believer in the power
and promise of free markets, free minds, and free nations. I am
also a believer in fostering the values that make them possible.
And I will admit no conflict between them. . .
<P>
<B>Commencement Remarks at Pepperdine University's School of Business
and Management</B> 
<P>
By Theodore J. Forstmann, Founding
<P>
Chairman, Empower America
<P>
...Basically, there are just two ways to organize society. The
first is the statist society, in which inequalities are reconciled,
resources are redistributed, and interaction is regulated through
the machinery of the state. The other is the civil society, in
which people organize themselves through voluntary association.
It's an old argument, filled with a lot of ideological 'isms'
and intellectual pretensions, but it basically comes down to a
question of who has the power to make some of the most important
decisions in your life. Do you invest your money, or does someone
else invest it for you? Do you choose your children's schools,
or are they assigned? Can you give to the charity of your choice,
or is the money funneled to state welfare programs? When you get
sick, can you pick your doctor or is your health-care plan prescribed.
<P>
The irony of the politicization of American life is that no country
on the face of the earth could be more ill-fitted for statism
than the United States of America. This is not a value judgment.
It is a simple statement of fact. For better or for worse, the
American spirit is not a bureaucratic spirit. It's a risk-taking,
rulebreaking, establishment-shaking spirit. While Western Europe
was groomed for statism in its centuries of monarchical rule,
America was born of revolution. For 60 years now, we have been
subjected to the materialist wisdom of the state as it imposed
ever increasing levels of social engineering. Today, sadly, we
all reap its non-spiritual devastating rewards...
<P>
<B>Closing Remarks at Empower America's National Economic Conference</B>

<P>
By Malcolm S. Forbes, Jr., Chairman of the Board, Empower America
<P>
...We're living in a world where, more and more, capital is intangible.
It's in the mind. And if people don't have an education, don't
have that tool, they're never going to get ahead. They're never
going to fulfill their potential. This new age is symbolized by
the microchip which is extending the reach of the human brain
the way machines extended the reach of human muscle in the last
century. The microchip, which is doubling in power every 18 months,
will dramatically expand our standard of living.
<P>
Our nation must take the lead to create and preserve not only
a national environment but an international environment where
democracy, pluralism, tolerance and free markets can take root
and flourish. Only we can guarantee that this will happen. If
we don't take the lead in making sure that there is a benign world
order, an environment where freedom can flourish, no one else
will. . .
<P>
<B>&quot;An Agenda for Economic Growth&quot;</B> 
<P>
By Lawrence Kudlow, Economist and Member of Empower America's
Board of Directors, Delivered at Empower America's National Economic
Conference
<P>
...During the Bush Administration some Republicans became ashamed
of their support for a lower capital gains tax. They cowered before
anyone who cried 'fairness' and abandoned the effort to reduce
it further and index it for inflation. By doing so, they surrendered
a core principle of successful economic policy: the idea that
growth comes from dynamism, risk-taking, and entrepreneurship
and that we cannot punish productive capital with a confiscatory,
unindexed tax on capital gains.
<P>
The entrepreneur suffers the most from bloated government spending
because he or she looks to government for little, but pays the
most every time taxes go up. Government &quot;investment&quot;--the
latest euphemism for more spending--may help a special interest
group, but the rest of society will suffer as incentives are blunted
and risk-taking is punished. Our economic and cultural policies
should nourish and support the family and the family-owned business,
not undermine them. We must pass an end to economic and social
policies which obstruct risk-taking in the marketplace and traditional
values at home. We need a vision that offers people maximum incentive
to succeed and a complementary vision that offers them maximum
faith and hope when they go home to their families...

<i>Regional Meeting Draws 400 Local Activists</i>
<P>
MIAMI, FL - Empower America drew over 400 local activists to its
fourth regional conference, held in Miami, Florida, January 19,
1994. The regional conferences are designed to engage participants
in open discussion with Empower America's Co-Directors William
Bennett, Jack Kemp, Jeane Kirkpatrick, Vin Weber and other political
leaders, in an effort to promote conservative grassroots activism
throughout the nation.
<P>
Participants in the Miami meeting discussed issues such as crime,
foreign policy and the economy at the one-day meeting. The morning
session, led by Empower America Co-Director William Bennett, focused
on national and community crime issues. Looking back on his tenure
as Drug Czar in the Bush Administration, Bennett told the grassroots
activists, &quot;I traveled to more than 100 communities in America,
most of which were poor communities. And whenever I visited these
communities I never heard people say 'let's deal with the root
causes of crime.'
<P>
What they kept asking me is, 'why can't you keep criminals off
the streets?' Our poor communities deserve the same protection
that society provides its more affluent communities.&quot; Joining
Dr. Bennett in the discussion were local experts who addressed
issues such as local law enforcement and community policing.
<P>
Among the highlights was a presentation by U.S. Senator Connie
Mack (R-FL), who addressed the conference on the Clinton administration's
domestic policy. Mack told the audience that since taking office,
President Clinton had largely backed away from his conservative
campaign promises. &quot;I'm very disappointed,&quot; Mack said,
'I'd give him a 'D' for his first year.&quot;
<P>
Jack Kemp chaired the afternoon discussion on community empowerment
and conservative prescriptions for economic renewal. As for the
problem of ending the cycle of poverty in American cities and
promoting economic growth for all, Kemp said, &quot;we've turned
our inner cities into socialized, almost Third World economies.
President Clinton is moving in the wrong direction. Instead of
easing government's burden on the American taxpayer and entrepreneur,
he's raised taxes, discouraged entrepreneurship and now he's trying
to nationalize health care, all under the disguise of a recovering
economy he has inherited.&quot;
<P>
Empower America will be hosting its next regional conferences
in Houston on May l9th and San Francisco on June 1st. For more
details on how you can participate in upcoming regional meetings,
call Empower America toll-free at 1-800-4EMPOWER.

<H3>Kirkpatrick Assails Clinton Policy in Europe</H3>
</CENTER>
<p>


MIAMI, FL--At Empower America's recent regional conference in
Miarni, former UN Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick gave an assessment
of the Clinton administration's policy in Europe, arguing that
President Clinton's recent statements, and the U.S. performance
at the recent NATO Summit, were viewed by the Europeans as &quot;a
broad policy of withdrawal, (and) a weakening of America's NATO
role in Europe.&quot; According to Kirkpatrick, the Europeans
believe foreign policy is more concerned with power than democratic
ideals, and the Clinton administration's fitful responses to the
reemergence of Europe's historical balance of power concerns has
produced an unnecessary and growing ambiguity about U.S. purposes
in Europe and in NATO.
<P>
By its failure to exercise U.S. Leadership in Europe and in NATO,
and by delegating too much authority to the United Nations Secretary
General, the Administration, Kirkpatrick asserted, has permitted
collective security to be weakened and &quot;has had a difficult
time finding common ground with our European allies.&quot;

<H3>What's Ahead for 1994</H3>
<P>
1993 has been a very successtul year for EmpowerAmerica. 
We created and built a brand new organization from the ground 
up, and with your support has forged it
into a powerful political voice for promoting
innovative ideas in the public arena. 
<P>
Now, as 1994 approaches, we have kicked off a number of exiting
projects for our second  year:
<UL>
<LI>To make sure that the campaigns of 1994 are tough on the
issues you and I care about, next year Empower America will be
hosting candidate training schools across the United States.
<LI>On Decomber 14, 1993, the one year anniversary of  President
Clinton's economic summit in Little Rock, Empower  America will
be hosting an economic summit of its own to assess the Clinton
Administration's perforrnance and to begin developing alternatives
to Clinton's economic agenda. <A HREF="/empower/aehigh21_2.html">
(see article)</A>.
<LI>In 1993, Empower America worked hard to promote Proposition
174, the California school choice initiative, and Proposition
593 the anticrime initiative  in Washington State, which places
repeat offenders convicted of their third felony in jail for life,
with no chance of parole, probation or work release. In 1994,
we will be backing more of these kinds of grassroots campaigns
in states across the country.
<LI>As the Clinton team continues to grope for a coherent foreign
policy we believe it is time for a serious dialogue on preserving
America 's leading role on the world stage. To this end, Empower<B>
</B>America plans<B> </B>to host its first major conference on
international issues.
<LI>And finally we will continue to expand Empower America's
efforts to bring our message of empowerment, opportunity and entrepreneurial
capitalism to new groups of citizens by establishing Empower America's
&quot;Community Empowerment Project.&quot;
</UL>

<P>
As you can see, 1994 will be an important year for us. We look
forward to working with you, and to seeing you at our 1994 regional
conferences. Please keep us informed about your ideas on how we
can make EA more effective in fighting for the ideas we believe
in.

<H3>NAFTA Approved by Congress</H3>
<P>
<I>Empower America Campaign Credited as Central to Securlng NAFTA
Victory</I>
<P>
<B>Washington, DC  </B>On November 17, the House of Representatives
voted 234 200 to approve The <B>North American Free Trade
Agreement</B> (NAFTA), the historic accord which will now link the
economies of the United States, Mexico and Canada into the world's
largest and most powerful free trading bloc. Days later the accord
easily passed the Senate, and will now be implemented beginning
January 1,1994.
<P>
The battle for NAFTA was hard fought, and Empower America's efforts
to help pass the trade pact were described by many as central
to the victory in Congress. In an article published before the
House vote, columnist Morton Kondracke praised Empower America's
efforts on behalf of NAFTA, calling them a model for other conservative
leaders to emulate. Empower America and its CoDirector Jack Kemp,
Kondracke wrote, &quot;are doing what the entire GOP leadership
should be doing: making passage of NAFTA one of its top priorities
for 1993... Kemp boosts NAFTA in every speech, blankets the nation's
oped pages with proNAFTA columns and is circulating a...proNAFTA
(open letter to America) among the nation's governors. Now other
GOP leaders need to take up the cause in an equally public way.&quot;
<P>
Indeed, Empower America was one of the earliest vocal supporters
of NAFTA. Early on, Kemp published proNAFTA opeds that ran in
newspapers in California, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Illinois,
Missouri, North Carolina, New York, Texas, Georgia, Arizona and
Massachusetts, spreading the NAFTA message to some 4.17 million
Americans. And, as the House vote neared, Kemp played a key role
delivering the GOP vote for NAFTA and winning over undecided House
Republicans
<P>
Empower America concentrated its efforts on bringing in the votes
of undecided Republicans, many of whom supported NAFTA in principle
but were hesitant to &quot;deliver a big victory for Bill Clinton.&quot;
Just one week before the vote, Kemp held a private, closed door
meeting on Capitol Hill with some 40 undecided GOP House Members
to discuss their concerns about the vote. Paraphrasing Lincoln,
Kemp told the Republicans to vote on their convictions on NAFTA
because &quot;you serve your party by serving your country.&quot;
Immediately following the meeting, Kemp held a Capitol Hill press
conference, at which several previously undecided Members announced
their support for NAFTA.
<P>
The following Sunday, Kemp appeared on &quot;This Week With David
Brinkley&quot; to argue the case for NAFTA. The next night, just
two days before the vote, Kemp took on conservative NAFTA
opponent Pat Buchanan in a oneonone debate, broadcast on CNN's
&quot;Larry King Live&quot;. The day before the vote, Kemp published
an editorial in the Washington Post, cowritten with Rep. Dick
Armey (TX), laying out the reasons why conservatives should support
NAF TA. And Kemp worked the phones lobbying Members who were still
wavering.
<P>
In the end, all these efforts paid off, as Republicans came through
for NAFTA, voting in favor by an overwhelming 132-43. The solid
GOP support provided the margin of victory for NAFTA&#151; as
the final tally showed, Clinton would never have succeeded in
passing the accord had he depended solely on his party's vote
in Congress.
<P>
With NAFTA now signed into law, Empower America is now calling
on the Clinton Administration to use the momentum the GOP has
provided him on free trade, and move quickly to expand NAFTA to
other Latin American countries. In a Wall Street Journal oped
published just after the House vote, Empower America President
Vin Weber called on the President to immediately &quot;pursue
the next step in building a hemispheric free trade zone: negotiations
to incorporate Chile, Argentina and Venezuela into the NAFTA trading
bloc.&quot;
<P>
Whether Clinton heeds this advice and continues to support free
trade policies, or seeks to heal his Administrations wounds
with organized labor by moving left again, remains to be seen.
But one thing is certain: thanks to the support of Congressional
Republicans, Ronald Reagan's vision of a North American free
trade zone has finally become a reality. Empower America is proud
to have played a major role in this historic effort.

<H3>The Forced Collectivization of Medicine</H3>
<P>
By Jack Kemp
<P>
After a Clinton Administration official let slip that 40% of Americans
will pay more under its health care plan, the President's media
rapid response team went immediately into action...to change the
subject.
<P>
The diversion they chose was a frontal assault on insurance companies.
&quot;It is time,&quot; Hillary Clinton told an audience of doctors,
&quot;for...every American to stand up and say to the insurance
industry, 'Enough is enough. We want our health care system back.'...It
is time we stood up and said, 'We are tired of insurance companies
running our health care system.'&quot;
<P>
The First Lady's attack would have been more credible if not for
this ironic fact: The centerpiece of the Clinton health plan is
a dramatic increase in the power of insurance companies over the
health of Americans&#151;the power to ration medical care.
<P>
Remember, first, how the Clinton proposal is designed to cut health
costs. It would create regional &quot;Health Alliances&quot; that
would enforce a health care budget by placing legal limits on
what insurance companies could charge. Insurers could be fined
if their premiums don't meet these caps on health costs.
<P>
The result? Only those insurance companies that place the most
effective, restrictive controls on what they are charged by doctors
and hospitals will survive. By some estimates, only 5 or 6 insurers
will remain, and each of these companies will provide &quot;managed
care&quot;&#151; programs to cut costs and meet a budget set by
government.
<P>
How is that budget met? Insurance companies will dictate how doctors
and hospitals reduce expenses. Insurance reviewers, or &quot;gatekeepers,&quot;
will micromanage medical treatments to cut costs, secondguessing
doctors and nurses. These bureaucrats with little direct knowledge
of a patient, will effectively have the final say on what specialists
that patient can see, or what tests and technology they deserve.
<P>
This, in essence, is the Clinton plan: Big government would require
a few big insurance companies to meet smaller health budgets.
Those companies, to cut costs, would do the dirty work of rationing.
<P>
Michael Tanner of the Cato Institute recently described how this
rationing process works in other nations with nationalized health
care. In Canada, hundreds of medical procedures and drugs that
once were covered by national insurance have been declared too
expensive and are no longer paid for&#151;a process Canadians
call &quot;delisting.&quot;
<P>
In Germany, a 1989 reform reduced the range of medical services
covered by that nation's &quot;social insurance&quot; program.
The story is similar in Britain, Spain, Sweden&#151; and Oregon.
Yes, Oregon.
<P>
That state's Medicaid program lists 709 medical services in order
of urgency. The list is then matched against the amount of government
funding available in the health budget. Only 535 medical procedures
made the cut this year, while the remainder will not be paid.
So, for example, the treatment of swelling of the esophagus&#151;
numbered 538&#151;is covered. Disk surgery&#151;number 536 --is
not.
<P>
The Clinton plan's national budget for health care would make
this kind of rationing inevitable for every American.
<P>
&quot;When individuals pay for their own health care,&quot; Michael
Tanner concludes, &quot;they decide what services to buy. When
government pays for health care, it decides what services it will
pay for. The availability of health care services becomes subject
to the whims of majority rule.&quot;
<P>
Even Stanford University's Alain Enthoven, one of the original
designers of &quot;managed competition,&quot; has opposed the
Clinton plan because it uses health alliances to impose price
controls.
<P>
Nationalized health care always puts bureaucrats in the business
of choosing who deserves care, and who does not. In the Clinton
plan, those bureaucrats would work for insurance companies, enforcing
a health budget set by the government. In other countries, those
bureaucrats work for the government directly. The effect, in
either case, is precisely the same: a decline in the quality
and accessibility of medicine.
<P>
<B>Bad Medicine: The Clinton Health Care Plan</B>
<P>
Despite the hours of television time and millions of dollars spent
by the Clinton Administration to drum up support for its health
care reform plan, the public isn't being told much about the details.
A close look at these details reveals why:<B> </B>the President's
health care plan masks the largest power grab by the federal government
in recent history.
<P>
Here's what the Clinton administration won't tell you about their
health care plan:
<P>
I. <B>Government bureaucracies will be granted massive new powers
to ration care, set price controls, and eliminate competition.</B>
<UL>
<LI>Price Controls: Central to the President's plan is the
creation of a new bureaucracy, the National Health Board (NHB)
which would set &quot;global budgets,&quot; or limits on the total
amount of public and private spending on health care. It would
also set price controls on insurance premiums and prescription
drug prices.
<LI>Rationed Care: If total health care spending exceeds the
governmentset &quot;global budget,&quot; rationing must follow.
Managedcare &quot;gatekeepers&quot; will have systemic incentives
to ration care to comply with the spending caps imposed on them
by governmental health bureaucracies.
<LI>Tyrannical Enforcement: The National Health Board would
also have bigbrotherish enforcement powers. If a state fails to
fully comply with its edicts, the NHB can cut off all health care
funds to the state or direct the Secretary of the Treasury to
impose a payroll tax on every employer in the state.
<LI>Outlawing Traditional Medicine: Everyone will be required
to purchase insurance through governmental &quot;health alliances&quot;
in each region. Health alliances choose which insurance plans
consumers can choose among; they can shut out any plan whose premium
is 20% above the average,
thereby eliminating feeforservice (traditional) medicine and forcing
all residents of a particular region into HMOs. Clinton's plan
could take away citizens' ability to choose their doctor.
</UL>

<B>II. The President's plan cannot be
 paid for without drastic tax or deficit increases.</B>
<UL>
<LI>Underestimated Costs: Clinton originally estimated the
cost of his plan to be $30 billion; now, most economists place
that figure at least $120 billion higher. Harvard Economist Martin
Feldstein estimated that the plan would require an additional
$120 billion in taxes in the first year alone.
<LI>Unrealistic Expectasions: The President plans to expand
Medicare to include prescription drug and longterm care coverage
(price tag: $152 billion) while realizing a net savings of $124
billion:cutting &quot;waste and fraud.&quot; He relies on a steep new
cigarette tax to finance the bulk of government subsidies, even
though many studies have shown that his tax will bring in less
than half of the revenues he is counting on.
</UL>
<B>III. Economic downturn and job destruction will result.</B>
<UL>
<LI>Employer Mandates: Small companies will face a payroll
tax of 3.5%&#151;an estimated $29 billion in new costs to those
small companies which now account for around 80% of new job creation.
Larger companies would have to pay 7.9% of their payroll.
<LI>Job Loss: The Employment Policies Institute estimates that
Clinton's employer mandates will eliminate 3.1 million jobs.
<LI>Dislocation: The health care industry accounts for 14%
of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employs 10 million people.
Huge changes in the structure and delivery of health care will
lead to significant dislocation and further job loss.
<LI>Stunted Innovations: Price controls on premium caps and
drug prices will stunt pharmaceutical and biomedical research
and development, which in turn, will postpone or eliminate the
opportunity to develop new drugs, prevention medicines, and disease
cures.
</UL>
<B>IV. Clinton's health plan strips individuals of choice,
autonomy, and privacy.</B>
<UL>
<LI>No Choice of Benefits: The Clinton Administration will
draw up a &quot;standardized benefits package;'9 that every American
is required to purchase. The content of this package will inevitably
be politicized.
<LI>Loss of Medical Privacy: Clinton would require every American
to carry with them at all times a &quot;National Health Care Card&quot;
which would contain one's entire medical history on a computerized strip. 
Anyone who can gain
electronic access (legally or illegally) to the computer system
could access an individual's medical records.
</UL>

<P>
President Clinton's health care plan begins with a wrong assumption
and ends with the wrong treatment. The President seeks to convince
us that our health care system&#151;which has consistently delivered
the best, most technologically advanced care in the world&#151;is
so broken that it must be replaced by bureaucracies and governmental
oversight. The flaws of our current health care system are real
and demand redress; changes in malpractice, tax, and insurance
laws are all necessary. But President Clinton's plan to disempower
Americans by placing the government in charge of health care will
ultimately result in higher prices, greater inefficiency, and
poorer health care.

<H3>EmpowerAmerica Launches 1994 Candidate Schools</H3>
<P>
Empower America is initiating a series of issues-oriented 1994
Candidate Schools to provide candidates at the local, state, and
national levels a coherent and comprehensive empowerment agenda.
These schools, to be held early next year in Washington, D.C.,
San Francisco, Denver, Detroit, Atlanta, and New York will focus
on economic competitiveness, growth, and entrepreneurship, free
trade, international leadership, health care, as well as education,
welfare, and crime.
<P>
Currently there are a number of political schools that address
the nuts-and-bolts of campaigns: fundraising, electoral strategies,
opposition research, and direct mail. What is missing, however,
are schools that present candidates with the <I>substantial </I>elements
of a political agenda and how best to campaign on such issues.
<P>
Candidates will be given a briefing book and a series of papers
authored by policy experts explaining the elements of the empowerment
agenda. Each candidate school will then be led by policy experts
who will explain the issues in detail, and political analysts
and pollsters who will instruct candidates on how to translate
the agenda into a winning campaign. Empower America's principals,
Jack Kemp, Bill Bennett, Jeane Kirkpatrick, and Vin Weber will
offer insights based on their political experience in governmental
leadership.
<P>
Interested candidates or campaign managers should contact Empower
America at 1-800-332-2000.

<H3>From the Grassroots....</H3>
<P>
Empower America held three successful grassroots events during the fall.
In Los Angeles, California, William Bennett, Vin Weber and Jack
Kemp greeted over 700 Empower America associates and supporters
at a highenergy reception honoring several of that city's noteworthy
citizen! who are devoted to the ideals of empowering individuals.
Also, it was our pleasure to be joined by Robert Woodson, Sr.
of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, Orson Swindle
of Empower America, and Leon Watkins of the Family Help Line,
all of whom played essential roles in the evening's success.
<P>
In Dallas, Texas, our members gathered for a daylong conference
led by Jack Kemp and Vin Weber to address topics of vital interest
to southwest America. The eloquent conservative insight of former
Chief of Staff to Vice President Quayle, Bill Kristol, and the hardhitting
pragmatism of Dallas' own, Mayor Steve Bartlett were major attractions.
We were also joined by local area experts for panel discussions
on the economy and NAFTA.
<P>
In New York City, Empower America held a dinner and panel discussion
with some notable conservative leaders. Joining Jack Kemp, Bill
Bennett, Jeane Kirkpatrick and Vin Weber, was radio talk show
host Rush Limbaugh. Also in attendance was National Review founder
and Editor-at-Large William F. Buckley, Jr.
<P>
We are currently scheduling 1994 conferences for Miami, Houston,
San Francisco, and New York.

<H3>Empower America and GrassRoot state Initiatives</H3>
<P>
By William J. Bennett
<P>
On November 2,1993, citizens of the C November 2,1993, citizens
of state of Washington passed two important referenda that should
serve as models to other states, and will hopefully be a harbinger
of things to come. Their success reflects a growing (and healthy)
citizen conviction that government's primary duty is to protect
its people, rather than confiscate and redistribute their income.
<P>
Proposition 593, also known as &quot;Three Strikes, You're Out,&quot;
will place criminals convicted of their third violent felony in
prison for life, with no chance for parole, probation, or work
release. The simple logic of ensuring the incarceration of the
most dangerous and violent criminals made plenty of sense to the
citizens of Washington state; &quot;Three Strikes, You're Out&quot;
garnered the support of 75% of the voters.
<P>
The reasons for Proposition 593's landslide victory are straightforward:
violent crime is destroying our social and civic order. And despite
evidence that the crime problem is largely caused by a small group
of hardcore criminals (studies indicate that two thirds of all violent
crimes are committed by less than 10 percent of criminals), government
has done little to protect law abiding citizens from these predators.
While the modern state has expanded its reach into virtually every
aspect of citizens' lives, it has increasingly abdicated its first
responsibility: to ensure public safety. Citizens are afraid and
they want to fight back; the passage of &quot;Three Strikes, You're
Out&quot; is a very good start. It may well serve as a blueprint
for other states, and has already been passed as an amendment
to a comprehensive crime bill awaiting passage in the U.S. Senate.
<P>
Voters also registered their opposition to an ever expanding &quot;nanny
state&quot; that takes too much from us in order to do too much
for us.
<P>
Proposition 601 restrains future state spending growth and tax
increases by limiting the growth of the state budget to the population
and inflation growth rate and mandates that any new tax increase
must be approved by the voters. Proposition 601's success heralds
a rising tide of public support for job creation over social service
expansion, and economic opportunity over higher spending. Today
there is an enormous gap between what people believe government
can do and what it actually can do. The passage of Proposition
601 is a first step toward narrowing the gap and securing a progrowth,
fiscally responsible economic program.
<P>
Conservatives need to lead a national conversation that examines
anew the relationship between government and the governed. What
happened on the first Tuesday in November was a good place to
begin. And events in Washington state should remind people to
look less to the nation's capital and more to the states and localities,
those &quot;laboratories of democracy,&quot; where the most innovative
reforms are taking place.

<H3>President's Message...</H3>

This has been a very busy three months. We launched our grassroots
citizens' action campaign to defeat the Clinton tax increases.
The Clinton plan wilI~ raise taxes, destroy jobs and increase&#151;not
lower&#151;the federal budget deficit. We worked hard to defeat
it. Many of you received your Tax Action Packet, which explained
what you could do in your own state to help defeat the Clinton
plan. Jack Kemp, WilL; am Bennett, Jeane Kirkpatrick and I gave
literally hundreds of radio and TV interviews, attacking the plan
and explaining why it will be so destructive to our economy. We
also launched an eightstate grassroots lobbying campaign to put
voter pressure on speciallytargeted, key &quot;swing vote&quot;
Senators. We appreciate the thousands of petition signatures that
you gathered and returned to us. And thanks to your generous support,
we were able to produce and place antitax radio ads on the Rush
Limbaugh show.
<P>
We're also working to promote positive change in America. We've
gotten behind the &quot;A Better Choice&quot; school choice ballot
initiative in California. It's the kind of innovative empowerment
idea America needs. It's a tough fight&#151;the antichoice forces
are spending millions of dollars to defeat us. But we're fightina
to win.
<P>
School choice will be one of the central themes at Empower America's
reception in Los Angeles September 23rd. The evening will feature
speeches by both William Bennett and Jack Kemp.
<P>
Our first conference in Milwaukee was a huge hit&#151;we sold
out all 700 spots. We'll also be holding regional conferences
this year in Dallas, Texas; and Phoenix, Arizona. To get a copy
of our special video of the Milwaukee conference, send in the
form on the last page of this newsletter.
<P>
We look forward to seeing many of you in LA, and appreciate all
your hard work in the antitax effort. Together, we can make a
difference.
<P>
<B>Vin Weber, President</B>

<H3>Warning: Tax Hikes Ahead</H3>
<I>Clinton Budget is mined with more taxes, new spending</I>
<P>
<B>By Jack Kemp</B>
<P>
Three years ago, Americans were hit with the highest tax increase
in history because of the disastrous 1990 Budget Deal that was
sold on the promise to reduce the deficit by $500 billion. Sound
familiar? The result: the deficit exploded to over $300 billion,
taxes were raised on the &quot;rich,&quot; while revenues were
reduced and the economy suffered from anemic growth.
<P>
History demonstrates that economic growth and deficit reduction
cannot be achieved through higher taxes and promises of future
spending cuts. The parallels between the 1990 Budget Deal and
President Clinton's 1993 Budget Deal are remarkable. Both packages
rely heavily on &quot;soaktherich taxes,&quot; a regressive gas
tax, and the hope that a future Congress will cut spending. Specifically,
the 1990 Budget Deal raised taxes by $158 billion. Clinton's package
will nearly double that tax increase. Moreover, 80% of all spending
cuts in the 1993 Budget Deal are not scheduled to take effect
until after 1996.
<P>
One would think that somewhere along the way to constructing and
selling a budget package that is a mirror image of the deal struck
less than three years ago, someone would check whether the desired
results were achieved. Apparently, it is not in President Clinton's
nature to do so. Now that data from the 1990 Budget Deal is in,
we can compare the promises with the results. According to the
IRS, in 1991 the rich paid 6.1 % less in taxes even though their
tax rates were raised in 1990. Can Clinton blame this on the
slow economy? No, he cannot. The middle class paid more in
taxes (1% more)
even though their tax rates stayed the same. According to projections
of the 1990 Budget Deal, the deficit this year should be $142
billion. In fact, it is over $300 billion.
<P>
There is nothing new in the President's tax and spend asoroach;
it has been tried again and again, not once achiev
ing lower deficits and higher growth. The reason why people are
buying into the President's call for sacrifice (through higher
taxes on Americans as the only alternative to smaller deficits)
is that there has been no complete explanation of the ramifications
of the Clinton plan. However, the blame can be extended across
party lines. Unf ortunately, many Republicans, along with the
Democrats, have paid zero atten
tion to the real alternative - GROWTH.
<P>
Americans, after reading the fine print, will come to realize
what is in store for them. Will higher taxes, massive cuts in
defense spending and a growing dependency on government services
lead to longterm prosperity? Or will a broader tax base through
lower rates and the responsible scalingback of government free
up the resources that individuals and families can use to control
their own destinies? The real defining issue is whether we allow
our Tiation to cure its economic ills through growth or taxation.
I side with growth and the American people.

<H3>American Leadership or Disengagement?</H3>


<B>By Jeane Kirkpatrick</B>
<P>
Everyone knows that candidate Bill Clinton promised a middle class
tax cut, while President Bill Clinton has increased the taxes
on the middle class.
<P>
Everyone knows that candidate Bill Clinton promised American armed
forces second to none, while President Bill Clinton has cut the
defense budget so deeply that the Secretary of Defense was forced
to change U.S. strategy and Clinton has also demoralized the armed
forces by imposing, without consultation, decisions that violate
basic American standards and values.
<P>
Everyone knows that candidate Clinton promised American air strikes,
if necessary, to save Bosnian civilians from Serbian aggression.
President Clinton has only followed the European lead in doing
nothing for too long.
<P>
Candidate Clinton promised to preserve U.S. leadership, but President
Clinton has retreated from a policy of leadership to a point of
acquiescent multilateralism. &quot;We have taken the lead,&quot;
said Secretary of State Warren Christopher, &quot;in passing to
multilateral bodies decisions and action on threats to peace.&quot;
They call it leadership. These policies variously called assertive
multilateralism, or cooperative security are, in fact, policies
of progressive AmeAcan disengagement and abdication.
<P>
The policy of &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; is applied far
beyond the issue of gays in the military to other important questions
of preparedness, morale and AmeAcan power.
<P>
Don't ask, don't tell how robust or hollow our military forces
will be after the scheduled cuts have been carried out.
<P>
Don't ask, don't tell what President Clinton will do when it becomes
even clearer that Iraq and North Korea are developing nuclear
weapons in spite of promises to the contrary.
<P>
Don't ask, don't tell what the Clinton Administration will do
when it is undeniably clear that China is selling missile technology
to Pakistan and nuclear technology to Iran - in spite of promises
to the contrary.
<P>
Don't ask, don't tell how the Clinton Administration proposes
to protect the continental United States from missiles launched
by the world's most violent dictators now that they have eliminated
funding for a strategic missile defense.
<P>
The President and Secretary of State have shown signs of improved
clarity and effectiveness in Lebanon and Bosnia, but not enough.
Further evidence of American disengagement can be perceived in
a variety of Clinton Administration decisions to date: the unconditional
extension of Most Favored Nation status to China, the unconditional
diplomatic recognition of the MPLA government of Angola, the uncon
ditional release of financial assistance to Nicaragua, the Administration's
continuing inaction on the North American Free Trade Agreement
and related hemispheric matters.
<P>
Some see in the U.S. insistence on multilateralism in economic
relations with Russia yet another example of a deliberate nonleadership
style in foreign policy.
<P>
Is the Clinton Administration renouncing the global leadership
the United States has excercised since World War II? Secretary
of State Warren ChAstopher has suggested that is the case, and
other State Department officials have recently emphasized the
Administration's determination to reduce U.S. commitments abroad.
<P>
One can only hope that our new president will heed the emerging
warning signs of the large price we, and the world, could pay
for abdication of U.S. leadership. The worldwide increase of terrorism
that has spread to the United States is a dramatic wakeup call.
A disengaged and unprepared America courts the very problems it
seeks to avoid.

<H3>The Politics of School Choice</H3>
<P>
<B>By William J. Bennett</B>
<P>
Over the last 30 years, we have witnessed a sharp decline in the
quality of public education. Today, low test scores, consistently
high dropout rates, drug use and increasing violence characterize
many of our public schools. Even as per student expenditures have
jumped (in constant 199192 dollars) from $2,035 in 1960 to $5,247
in 1990, student performance has continued to decline. Median
SAT scores have fallen almost 80 points over the last three decades,
and a recent international comparison of math and science skills
scored Americans at the bottom of the list of industrialized countries.
We need real reform, and we need it now.
<P>
The problem with our public schools is not a lack of money. Indeed,
both teacher salaries and overall educational expenditures have
increased dramaticallv. The failure of our schools is systemic:
despite the poor record of many schools,
unionization has strengthened the education establishment's power
over students and parents. Teachers' unions have made it virtually
impossible to fire even the most inept educator, and have freed
administrators from accountability. Parents, particularly lowerincome
parents, have few recourses, since they often lack the financial
means to send their child elsewhere.
<P>
The current system is a wreck; it hurts students, it undermines
parents and it perpetuates a social injustice. The American people
sense this: more than 70% of Americans support school voucher
systems, and as of 1992, 34 states were considering various school
choice initiatives. Increasingly, even teachers and education
bureaucrats lack faith in the system they defend&#151;22% send
their children to private schools, for example, and that number
is far higher in urban school districts. The widespread support
for school choice is part of
the &quot;parents' rights movement,&quot; in this case an attempt
by parents to regain control from an education bureaucracy that
has stripped individual schools of their autonomy and incentives
to meet student needs.
<P>
School vouchers would provide all parents - regardless of income
level - with an equal opportunity to secure a quality education
for their child. If parents are pleased with the public school
their child attends, as many parents will be, the voucher
will simply stay with that school. If they are not, parents would
now have a choice - they could send their child elsewhere,
to another public school, or to a private or religious school.
This is the same concept we use in higher education; students
can use government grants and loans to attend the University of
Indiana, Notre Dame or Yeshiva University. Higher education performs
better because of the competition.
<P>
The intellectual debate about school choice is just about over.
It will increase competition, accountability and parental involvement.
It will save taxpayers money. Indeed, school choice is the most
important and farreaching education reform in America.
<P>
The only people to benefit from the public schools' lock on educational
resources are those who hold the key&#151;the teachers' unions
and the educational bureaucracy they represent. The National Education
Association (the nation's largest union with 2.1 million
members) has a
vested interest in ensuring public schools' monopoly over taxpayer
money, which is why they are raising teachers' dues for the express
purpose of funneling more than $15 million into a campaign to
defeat school choice in California. That is why we at Empower
America are taking a leading role in the fight for school choice
in California. As a recent <I>Forbes </I>article noted, &quot;The
public may be only dimly aware of it, but the union's growing
power has exactly coincided with the dismal spectacle of rising
spending on education producing deteriorating results.&quot; 
<P>
The timehonored task of education is to provide children with
sound intellectual and moral instruction. School choice empowers
parents to select schools that reflect the values and the academic
goals that they hold for their children.

<H3>Success in Milwaukee</H3>

<I>Standing Room Only at Conference</I>
<P>
&quot;...more than 700 regional political activists gathered
here. . .to celebrate. . .ideas. Conservative ideas such as public
school choice, welfare limits, free enterprise-style economic incentives
and things as basic as good oldfashioned tax cutting.&quot;
<P>
<RIGHT><I>-Wisconsin State Journal, </I>June 26, 1993</RIGHT>
<P>
&quot;President Clinton's economic, foreign and social policy
initiatives were found lacking by three prominent conservatives
who were in Milwaukee for the first meeting of a new national
organization called Ernpower America.&quot;
<P>
<RIGHT><I>-Milwaukee Sentinel, </I>June 25, 1993</RIGHT>
<P>
Well over 700 enthusiastic supporters crowded into Milwaukee's
Italian Community Center on June 25th to hear Empower America's
William Bennett, Jack Kemp and Jeane Kirkpatrick as they launched
their series of regional conferences. With more than twenty events
scheduled over the next 18 months, these conferences are designed
to integrate national policies with state and local initiatives
and programs.
<P>
The Milwaukee event featured a morning session of comments by
William Bennett, Jack Kemp and Jeane Kirkpatrick, followed by
energetic question and answer sessions.
<P>
The lunch session featured two prominent conservative leaders.
Wisconsin Governor Tommy Thompson, a member of Empower America's
Gubernatorial Advisory Board, listed his state's numerous innovations
in the areas of education and welfare reform. Bob Woodson, president
of The National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, focused on
reviving our nation's inner cities through economic growth and
policies which encourage home ownership and &quot;workfare&quot;,
not welfare.
<P>
The afternoon panels emphasized school choice and economic growth,
and provided an indepth look at efforts in these areas on the
local and state levels.

<H3>Battling for School Choice:EA Joins the
Grassroots Effort in Calif. </H3>

<P>
On November 2, the people of California will vote on Proposition
174, a revolutionary school choice initiative tesignet to empower
parents, reform education and save taxpayers money. The initiative
would give parents the opportunity to choose where their children
will be educated&#151;at a public, private or religious school.
If parents choose a public school, that school receives full funding,
about $5,200 per child. If parents choose a private or religious
school, they will receive a voucher worth half that amount, about
$2,600, to be used to pay the tuition (62 percent of California's
private schools cost $2,600 or less.)
<P>
Empower America is playing a leading role in the battle for school
choice in California. CoDirector William 1. Bennett signed the
ballot argument supporting Proposition 174 that will be sent to
all of the state's registered voters and he plans to participate
in numerous school choice events. CoDirector Jack Kemp has raised
$600,000 for the effort thus far. For a School Choice Action Packet,
please call 1-800-332-2000.

<H3>Free Trade and NAFTA</H3>

<P>
The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is scheduled to
be considered this fall by Congress. This agreement will make
history&#151;either as the missed opportunity that cost the U.S.
jobs, increased trade and a more competitive economy; or as the
creator of the world's largest free trade zone which expanded
exports to Canada and Mexico and created a growing supply of higher
paying jobs. Despite support by President Clinton, NAFTA might
not make it thtnilah Concrrecc Tf those onnosed to NAFTA would
only
look at the facts, they would find consensus among economists
who has seriously studied the documents and realize that it will
increase U.S. exports and create American jobs.
<P>
Before Mexico's 1986 decision to join the General Agreement on
Trade and Tariffs (GATT), tariffs on U.S. exports
were as high as lOOSo; Now they are down to an average of 10%.
The average tariff placed on Mexican products being sold in the
U.S. is 3%. The arithmetic is straightforward. The U.S. clearly
has more to gain by the elimination of tariffs. But let the facts
tell the story: since 1986 these declining tariffs produced a
windfall of export activity (see chart), shifting our trade status
with Mexico from a deficit of $4 billion to a surplus of $9 billion.
Mexico has become the fastest growing export market, purchasing
73% of its imports from the U.S. It has now established itself
as our second largest market; Canada being the first. Consequently,
as the Mexican economy grows, so do U.S. exports.
<P>
These increased exports have already created 300,000 new
jobs, doubling the number of jobs supported by exports to Mexico
(see chart). In fact, the Department of Commerce estimates that
each extra $1 billion in exports creates over 19,000 net new jobs.
The Institute for International Economics projects that by 1995,
over 1 million U.S. jobs will be supported by U.S. exports to
Mexico alone.
<P>
The answer to the question, &quot;what kind of American jobs will
be produced by the NAFTA agreement?&quot; is key. According to
the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, exportrelated jobs
pay 17% more than the average U.S. wage. This applies to workers
in both the service and manufacturing industries.
<P>
Our borders and trading patterns have a finite capacity; but our
potential to expand trade and grow the economy, is infinite&#151;provided
we pursue free trade. The evidence is dear. If PresidentClinton
truly wants a stimulus package that creates longterm, private
sector jobs, he would seize the moment and urge passage of this
agreement now.

<H3>President's Message...</H3>
<P>
This is a critical time for our country as we are finally getting
a good look at President Clinton's economic plan. It's tax and
spend all over again.
<P>
The bottom line for individuals, families, and businesses: the
biggest tax increase in American history, $328 billion over five
years; an effective acrosstheboard tax increase on every taxpayer
of up to 20 percent; a tax on individuals earning as little as
$30,000; and more government spending. Whatever happened to President
Clinton's campaign promise to cut taxes for the middle class?
<P>
Every time you turn around, the Clinton team is talking about
another new tax on American families and workers. But they never
talk about cutting taxes.
<P>
Empower Arnerica thinks that's wrong and we've launched a campaign
to defeat the Clinton tax hikes. By energizing activists like
yourself, we're convinced <B>that the Clinton tax bill </B>can
be defeated. America needs economic policies that promote growth,
create jobs, and provide opportunity for entrepreneurs.
<P>
President Clinton says that his policies reflect the &quot;new&quot;
Democrat. Frankly, I can't tell the difference between his tax
hikes and tax hikes of the old Democrats. We need to get the economy
moving up the growth curve again. The Clinton tax increases will
only hurt our economy and increase the deficit.
<P>
Bill Clinton thinks you're not paying enough taxes. Empower America
thinks Americans are overtaxed, and we need your help in defeating
these tax increases and promoting an agenda for economic growth.
<P>
At a grassroots level, thousands of concerned citizens are helping
us to promote conservativeoriented empowerment strategies at all
levels of government. So, if you're concerned about Bill Clinton's
tax and spend policies, stay involved with Empower America. We
know there's a better way. 
<P>

<H3>Clinton's First 100 Days</H3>
Bill Clinton now concedes that his presidency is off to a rough
start. The problem, the White House would have us believe, has
to do with a lack of &quot;agenda discipline,&quot; trying to
do too much too soon. Mr. Clinton's problems, however, run much
deeper. <I>His Administration is not working because his liberal
philosophy is not taking.</I>
<P>
At an April 28th press conference, Empower America released its
analysis, &quot;The Credibility Gap: The First 100 Days of the
Clinton Administration.&quot; Among the key points:
<P>
  1. The idea heavily marketed during the campaign that Mr. Clinton
was a &quot;New Democrat&quot; has been disproved.The gap between
candidate Clinton and President Clinton is rapidly becoming a
gulf. He has reversed himself on middle class tax cuts, free trade,
Haitian refugees, home ownership for lowincome Americans, and
tax funding for abortions, among other issues. This is part of
the reason why his opinion ratings are the lowest in history of
any president at a comparable point.
<P>
 2. The presupposition that guides the Clinton Administration's
policies is, as the President told a joint session of Congress,
&quot;government must do more.&quot; In Bill Clinton's America,
the federal government will tax more, spend more, regulate more&#151;and
the American people will depend on government more. The public's
increasing frustration and alienation toward government does not
square with President Clinton's vision of an everexpanding government.
<P>
  3. During the campaign Bill Clinton invoked the word &quot;change&quot;
like an incantation. He made a compelling case for &quot;reinventing
government.&quot; But he seems far less interested in reinventing
government than in reinflating it. President Clinton's budget
will increase spending almost $300 billion over the next five
years.
<P>
4. Bill Clinton's political career has been characterized by an
easy abandonment of commitments. Rather than allaying these concerns,
President Clinton has confirmed them through a series of welldocumented
policy reversals. Bill Clinton is coming dangerously close to
forfeiting a president's most precious political asset -- his
credibility with the American electorate.
<P>
5. President Clinton has failed to create a government that can
govern. Many agencies still lack key appointments. Meanwhile,
President Clinton's policies and tactics have galvanized the Republican
party to a remarkable degree while key Democrats are backing away
from many of the President's proposals.
<P>
The Clinton presidency is way off stride and on the defensive.
His Administration appears overwhelmed. Public skepticism is rising.
It is in the nation's best interest for Bill Clinton to purposefully
steer his presidency to the responsible center --  which after
all is how he got elected.
<P>

<H3>The American Scene: Leading Cultural Indicators</H3>
by William J. Bennett
<P>
The Index of Leading Cultural Indicators, the most comprehensive
statistical portrait available of behavioral trends over the last
30 years, was released on March I 5th. The Index provides an empirical
analysis of the condition of modern American society.
<P>
The findings are troubling. Over the last three decades we have
experienced substantial social regression. Since 1960 there has
been a 560 percent increase in violent crime; more than a 400
percent increase in illegitimate births; a quadrupling in divorce
rates; a tripling of the percentage of children living in singleparent
homes; more than a 200 percent increase in the teenage suicide
rate; and a drop of almost 80 points in the average S.A.T. scores.

<P>
The Index does more than document cultural decline; it points
to some solutions. Cultural renewal depends above all on strengthening
and revitalizing our social and civic institutions -- families,
churches, schools, and neighborhoods. But government has a role to play. 
First, government should heed
the old injunction, &quot;Do no harm.&quot; The longterm impact
programs have on strengthening families, discouraging dependency
and criminal behavior, and encouraging educational achievement
should inform debate on social policy. Second, political leaders
should make use of their ability to shape attitudes through discourse
and legislation. Third, a legislative social agenda should emphasize
a tough and intelligent criminal justice system; radical education
reform (including school choice for public, private, and religious
schools); reversal of the destructive incentives of the welfare
system; removal of economic barriers to those living in poverty;
support of families by increasing the personal dependent exemption;
rescinding nofault divorce laws; removal of major obstacles to
adoption; improving child support collection; and encouraging
responsible fatherhood.
<P>
The Index struck a responsive chord with the public.  More than
70,000 people called to request copies of it. The Index also received
extensive media coverage, including 130 newspapers each with a
circulation over 100,000 and more than 500 newspapers overall;
and television, radio, and magazine coverage. It received favorable
coverage from the <I>Washington Post's </I>David Broder, the <I>Wall
Street Journal's</I> Paul Gigot, and nationally syndicated columnists
Mona Charen, Cal Thomas, Georgie Anne Geyer, Morton Kondracke,
Ben Wattenberg, and Richard Grenier.
<P>
Perhaps the most encouraging news is that there is a rough consensus
emerging about the nature of the cultural debate. Gerald Seib
wrote in the <I>Wall Street Journal </I>that recent writings on
social issues, including the Index, are &quot;starting to cause
ripples inside Washington, and in time are likely to transform
the standard liberalconservative debate over social policy.&quot;

<H3>It's the Economy, Stupid Not A Stupid Economy</H3>
by Jack Kemp
<P>
Conservative activists now have an opportunity to defeat President
Clinton's tax increases and to go to the American people with
a superior agenda for real jobs, real economic growth and renewed
American leadership in the global economy.
<P>
First, we must debunk Clinton's notion that higher taxes will
lead to a more prosperous America. In reality, higher taxes will
weaken the economy, reduce revenues and increase the deficit.
Never in American history have tax increases created jobs or economic
growth. 
<P>
<B>A ProGrowth Agenda</B>
<P>
Empower America believes we can reduce the size of government
and lower the deficit without raising taxes. At the same time,
we support a progrowth agenda that really puts people first, not
government.
<P>
Here are some ideas for a growth agenda:
<P>
 <I>&#149; </I><B>Encourage en&#166;repreneurship, saving, investment</B>
<P>
The best way to rekindle the job creating power of America's entrepreneurs
is to expand the supply of risk capital available to finance creative
new ideas and develop new products. All provisions in the tax
code affecting saving and investing should be immediately indexed
to stop the corrosive effect of inflation. This includes indexing
capital gains taxes, depreciation allowances, corporate tax rates,
and retirement plans, such as IRAs and 401Ks.
<P>
Ultimately, we should phase out the capital gains tax altogether
on longterm investments and eliminate it for anyone who works,
saves, or invests in America's lowincome communities.
<P>
<I>&#149; </I><B>Tax relief for families and working Americans</B>
<P>
We should advocate a flat, fair, and simple tax system that rewards
success instead of punishing it.
<P>
To spur job creation, the payroll tax, currently the greatest
burden on middle class families and small businesses, should be
reduced. Since the mid1960s, the payroll tax has more than doubled
from 7.25 percent to 15.3 percent today. Middle income families
now face an effective marginal tax rate on all income of over
30 percent, compared with less than 20 percent 30 years ago. Reducing
this tax would expand employment by lowering the cost of hiring
additional workers and increasing the reward for working for unemployed
Americans.
<P>
 We must also champion tax reform, such as raising the dependent
exemption, that recognizes the family as America's paramount valueshaping
institution. The moral, spiritual, and cultural health of our
nation is inextricably linked with the strength of the Amencan
family. That strength is being undermined by government policies,
both economic and social, which are biased against marriage and
famiiies with children.
<P>
<I>&#149; </I><B>Spending restraint</B>
<P>
Spending restraint and regulatory relief is a key part of our
philosophy of limited government. Government spending absorbs
valuable resources, often for inefficient and wasteful purposes.
<P>
While cutting wasteful spending, there must also be strong budget
caps to restrain the growth of government spending. Capping the
rate of entitlement growth, except Social Security, at inflation
plus population growth,would save more than $250 billion over
five years.
<P>
However, real spending control requires institutional changes
to enforce accountability in the federal budget process, including
a lineitem veto to help balance the budget without raising taxes.
<P>
<B>* Free Trade</B>
<P>
Opentrading policies helped expand the global export market to
$3.1 trillion by 1989. Mr. Clinton is dangerously reversing course
by threatening trade wars with Europe and Japan.
<P>
The key to U.S. and global economic growth lies in opening new
markets to goods and services. Passing a clean, mutually beneficial
North American Free Trade Agreement and completing the floundering
Uruguay round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is
a top priority.
<P>
The next step is to negotiate marketopening trade agreements culminating
in a hemispheric freetrade zone. Our ultimate goal should be to
incorporate the Pacific Rim nations, Russia and other former communist
states into an open global trading system.
<P>
Clinton's farleft liberal policies must be stopped to prevent
them from hurting America.  Now is the time for us to once again
raise the banner of economic growth, low taxes, limited government,
strong families and equality of opportunity for all. Nothing could
produce a sharper contrast with the policies of the Clinton administration.
<P>

<H3>NATIONAL SECURITY FOR THE '90s</H3>
By Jeane Kirkpatrick
<P>
There have been three great watersheds in the twentieth century&#151;moments
when the world came apart and recreated itself.
<P>
The first occured in the wake of World War I, and like today,
the optimistic trend in Europe was to a continent of democratic
governments. But in the decades that followed, Lenin in Russia,
Hitler in Germany, and Mussolini in Italy were able to seize power.
In each case, resurgent nationalism and a tradition of authoritarianism
played a role. In each case, the world stood by as democracy floundered.
And in each case, the cost of failed democracy proved incredibly
high. World War II, the Holocaust, and the Cold War were only
part of the price. The replacement of new democracies with Bolsheviks,
Fascists, and Nazis was wholly unexpected. It should prompt us
to ask ourselves now: what could happen that we do not expect?
<P>
The second watershed of the century occurred following World War
II. After Eastem Europe was conquered by the Soviets, the democracies
<I>did </I>act to prevent Westem Europe from the incorporation
into the Soviet bloc. U.S. resistance &#151; in the form of the
Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan and NATO&#151;stopped the Soviet's
westward drive. NATO succeeded in providing a framework for democracy,
development, and stability because it was an organization of democracies
around the principle of collective security. Each time a former
dictatorship&#151;Germany, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece&#151;was
incorporated into NATO after they established democratic institutions,
the belief that membership in NATO reinforced democracy was reiterated.
<P>
Now, in the wake of the collapse of Communism and the end of the
period of Soviet military threat, we have arrived at the third
great watershed. It is a moment of possibility when the world
is creating itself again. The transition of the former communist
states from totalitarianism to democracy, and from command to
market economies has already proved more complex and difficult
than was generally anticipated. The consequences of failure could
be catastrophic, yet no innovative Westem response comparable
to the Truman Doctrine, the Marshall Plan, NATO, or the Common
Market has been forthcoming. <I>It is critically important that
we make room for the new democracies in Western institutions.</I>
<P>
Now is the time to think about collective security. The U.S. and
the democracies helped create the context for the defeat of Communist
governments by providing an altemative model of more successful
societies and by maintaining military strength. But the peoples
of Central and Eastem Europe were not liberated by foreign armies,
but by their own efforts. They are already our allies in SpiIit.
We should make them allies and trading partners in fact.
<P>
After World War II, we believed that institutionalized association
with other democracies would reinforce habits of constitutional
rule and peaceful cooperation. We were right. It is time to apply
the lessons.
<P>

<TITLE>Foreword</TITLE>
<H2>Foreword</H2>
<HR SIZE=2>
<P>

<P>	Much has been made of the collapse of state socialism and the post-Cold War global march 
toward free markets. In reality, however, progress has been slow--and in some parts of the world 
nonexistent. Even today, as the authors show in the study that follows, only a relative handful of   countries--and we are blessed to be among them--have truly free economies. And some of them, our own 
included, are backsliding.
<P>	The recent shift in the congressional balance of power provides U.S. policymakers with one of 
those truly rare opportunities to rethink the way the United States government conducts its business. One 
area in which such a reexamination is long overdue is foreign aid.
<P>	As Admiral James W. Nance, senior Republican staffer on the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee told <I>The Washington Post</I> shortly after the 1994 congressional elections, the 
amount of money the United States has spent since 1947 on foreign aid equals more than one-third of the 
federal debt. Much of it has been wasted.
<P>	U.S. development aid should have one priority, and one priority only: promoting the kind of free 
market growth that will enable the recipient country to prosper <I>without</I> foreign aid. If U.S. aid 
does not promote free market capitalism and self-sufficiency, we need to ask the question: Why are we 
giving it?
<P>	The Heritage Foundation's<I> Index of Economic Freedom</I> provides compeling evidence 
that economic prosperity and economic freedom go hand in hand. Lasting prosperity cannot exist in the 
absence of economic freedom; and a free economy inevitably results in economic growth and rising living 
standards.
<P>	If nothing else, the November 1994 elections reflected the U.S. public's dissatisfaction with 
business as usual. Well-intentioned programs that fail to accomplish their goals--and in some cases 
make matters worse--can no longer be tolerated. The U.S. foreign aid program is a classic example of 
this: good intentions gone awry.
<P>	While U.S. and global policymakers and opinion-leaders have rightly placed considerable 
emphasis over the years on political freedom, economic freedom has received scant attention. It's almost 
as if the policy community has determined that it doesn't matter. But it does matter. In fact, it is the key. 
If a country has a free economy, it can lift itself--and its people--out of poverty. We see this today in 
Asia, Latin America, and even in the early stages in parts of the former Soviet empire. We also see that 
economic freedom is a breeding ground for political freedom. South Korea, the Republic of China on 
Taiwan, Chile, and many other emerging markets provide vivid proof that economic prosperity depends on 
the opportunities created by a free economy, not on U.S. aid, the heavy hand of government planning, or 
even advanced infrastructure and abundant natural resources. Freedom is what counts most.
<P>	Former Treasury Secretary William Simon told me after reviewing a draft copy of <I>The Index 
of Economic Freedom</I> that it may well be the single most important publication ever published by 
The Heritage Foundation, surpassing even the best-selling <I>Mandate for Leadership</I> series which 
guided the Reagan Administration in the 1980s.

<TITLE>Preface</TITLE>
<H2> Preface</H2>
<HR SIZE=2>
<P> Despite the near total collapse of socialism around the world, most countries still do not have free 
economies.  This is the main conclusion of the<I> Index of Economic Freedom,</I> a comparative study 
of economic freedom in the world.  The authors of the <I>Index</I>, Bryan Johnson and Thomas Sheehy, 
have discovered that most rich countries are also the most economically free.  Conversely, their research 
shows that most poor countries have economies that are unfree.  Thus, economic freedom is a critical 
factor in the relative wealth of nations.  The more government interferes in the market, the more it 
hampers economic growth and lowers the standard of living of its citizens.
<P>	These issues, though subject to academic study, have never been addressed in such a 
comprehensive manner. Thus, this report should lay to rest once and for all doubts about whether 
economic freedom is integral to economic development.  As the conclusions of this study show, there 
can be no doubt that the more free an economy is, the higher the likelihood of economic development.   
<P>	The idea of creating an index of economic freedom has been long in the making.  Milton 
Friedman and other economists for years have explored ways to measure the relative economic freedom 
of countries around the globe.  Groundbreaking work was done by the Fraser Institute and others to build 
the academic foundation upon which an index could be built.  However, in the mid-1980s analysts at The 
Heritage Foundation began thinking about ways to create an index that would be useful to policymakers, 
particularly with respect to allocating levels of foreign aid.  We were looking for a "user friendly" version 
of the index that could unambiguously show policymakers and investors the positive relationship between 
economic freedom and wealth.   
<P>	Thus was born The Heritage Foundation's<I> Index of Economic Freedom</I>, the first study of 
its kind.  It measures the economic freedom of over 100 countries according to the most important 
economic factors determining economic freedom, such as taxes, tariffs, and protection of private 
property.  Not all economic factors could or even should be examined.  Our task was to find accurate data 
for the most important factors, and then to provide the most comprehensive and accurate comparison 
possible. That is what the authors of the<I> Index</I> have done.  Avoiding paralyzing academic debates, 
the authors focus on what is known, and not on what can never be known.  The result is the most accurate 
snap-shot possible of how the countries of the world measure up to the standards of economic freedom.
<P>	There will be many uses for the <I>Index</I>.  Policymakers will find it helpful in determining 
whether Third World countries should be receiving foreign aid; that is, whether it will be squandered in 
economically unfree countries. They can discover that the main cause of poverty around the world is not 
the failure of rich countries to spread the wealth through foreign aid programs, but the misguided 
economic policies of developing countries themselves.  They also will find a paradox: The countries that 
appear to most need U.S. aid are the ones that least deserve it because their government-controlled 
economies will misuse the money.  By the same token, the countries that are least likely to squander U.S. 
aid because they have free economies are the countries that least need it.  Either way, there seems to be 
less of a need for so-called development aid.  The key to economic prosperity in the developing world is 
not foreign aid, but economic freedom.
<P>	Investors should find the<I> Index</I> to be useful as well.  While many countries are 
encouraging foreign investment through privatization and other means, and have more open economies 
than they did a few years ago, the report shows that the countries' economic "fundamentals" can be more 
important to investors than the strengths or weaknesses of particular companies or business sectors.  
These fundamentals include tax rates, the stability of the currency, trade policy, private property rights, 
and other factors considered by the <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I>.
<P>	The<I> Index</I> should be a first stop for any investor who wishes to explore economic 
opportunities in a particular country or region. With the<I> Index</I>, economic trends can be discerned 
and regional comparisons can be made. While investment decisions always require in-depth and hands-on 
research by the companies themselves, the <I>Index</I> can be used as a starting point of research, 
particularly regarding investment decisions in developing countries.
<P>	Finally, the study should be an indispensable source of primary data and bibliographical 
references on the world's economies.  The authors use the most up-to-date information available.  They 
also have assembled an impressive bibliography that not only attests to the depth of their research, but can 
point other researchers in the right direction in their work.
<P>	Future editions of the <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I> will enable readers to compare 
countries over time. Thus, trends in economic freedom will be established, which should be particularly 
useful to policymakers who are concerned with assessing the impact of foreign aid.
<P>	This report is a tremendously important undertaking of which I and the rest of the Heritage staff 
are justly proud.  It should show, once and for all, that economic freedom is no less important than 
political freedom.  As a human right which governments should be bound to protect, if for no other reason 
than concern for the general welfare of its citizens, economic freedom is a critically important key to the 
well-being of people.  It can be a measure not only of how free a person is, but of how rich or poor.  This 
is a powerful, even revolutionary idea.  If applied around the world, it could transform the world's 
economy.   It is in the hope that this report will contribute to that end that I present The Heritage 
Foundation's <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I>.

<TITLE>Acknowledgments</TITLE>
<H2> Acknowledgments</H2>
<HR SIZE=2>
<P>	We would like to express our appreciation to several individuals who helped to make the 
<I>Index of Economic Freedom</I> possible.  We thank Dr. Kim R. Holmes, Vice President and 
Director of Foreign and Defense Policy Studies at The Heritage Foundation, who edited the study, 
and Larry Di Rita, his Deputy, for providing invaluable assistance and support for the project.  
Richard Odermatt and Tom Timmons bore the brunt of the<I> Index's</I> considerable 
production work.  Their good cheer was most welcome.  Rob Chase of the Foreign and Defense 
Policy Studies staff was extremely helpful with managing data.  Dr. Edward L. Hudgins, now of the 
Cato Institute, deserves credit for laying much of the foundation of the <I>Index</I> several years 
ago while serving as Director of the Center for International Economic Growth at The Heritage 
Foundation. 
<P>	Countless individuals serving with various accounting firms, businesses, research organizations, 
U.S. government agencies, embassies in Washington, and other organizations cooperated in providing us 
with data.  Their assistance, which so often went beyond our expectations, is much appreciated.  
<P>	The contribution of two individuals deserves special attention.  Christian Asis and Rebecca 
Schaefer, participants in The Heritage Foundation's summer internship program, were indispensable to the 
development of the <I>Index</I>.  It was Christian and Becky who did the legwork, tracking down data 
while exercising excellent judgment in the process.  Their unfailing good spirit and commitment were 
exceptional.
<P>	We would like to thank the Fraser Institute of Vancouver and the many scholars who have 
participated in its Rating Economic Freedom Project for doing groundbreaking work on measuring 
economic freedom.<FONT SIZE="-2">(1)</FONT>  
<P>	Finally, we are grateful for the advice and criticism from the experts who reviewed this study. 
Richard V. Allen, Dr. James B. Burnham, Dr. Stuart M. Butler, Nicholas Eberstadt, Dr. Leonid Grigoryev, 
Dr. Henry R. Nau, Thomas L. Rhodes, Dr. Gerald W. Scully, and Hon. William E. Simon all helped to 
make this a better book.
<P>	Of course, we alone bear responsibility for the <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I>.  Therefore, 
any shortcomings belong to us.

<TITLE> Executive Summary </TITLE> 
<H2> Executive Summary</H2> 
<HR SIZE=2>
<P>	The idea of producing a "user-friendly" Index of Economic Freedom for policymakers was born at  The Heritage Foundation in 1989.  The purpose then, as it remains today, was to develop an index that 
measures the extent of economic freedom in countries around the world.  To this end a set of objective 
economic criteria has been established to grade over 100 countries. While there are many theories about the origins and causes of economic development, the findings of this study are conclusive: those countries with the most economic freedom have higher rates of economic development than those with less economic freedom.
<P>	The Index of Economic Freedom measures how well these countries score on a list of ten economic factors.  The higher the score, the more government interference in the economy (hence, the less economic freedom there is). The factors are: 
<UL><B>
1. Trade Policy<BR>

<P>	The study demonstrates unequivocally that countries with the highest level of economic freedom (the lowest Index score) also have the highest living standards (see following chart).  Likewise, countries that have the least amount of economic freedom (the highest Index score) have the lowest living standards.
<P>	A comparison of the Index scores also demonstrates an interesting phenomenon: wealthy and 
economically free countries tend over time to reintroduce restrictions on economic freedom (see chart). As they become wealthy, countries begin adding welfare and other social programs that were not affordable when they were poorer. Thus, after they have become economically "liberated," countries like Germany, Sweden, and even the United States tend to fall back down the scale of economic freedom, getting worse scores than newly emerging free economies like Hong Kong or Singapore. These "Asian tigers" are still growing and developing and have not yet begun to restrict their economies with post-industrial welfare and environmental policies. This phenomenon, when displayed graphically, is called the Curve of Economic Freedom. It shows that economic freedom can rise and fall and that the seeds of destruction can exist in the fruits of success.
<P>	Another conclusion of this report concerns how fast developing countries with free economies grow. The data and scoring show that developing countries that pursued economic liberalization quickly became the richest in the world. Conversely, developing countries that did not pursue economic liberalization remained poor (see chart). Clearly, the path to prosperity is paved by economic liberalization and maximized economic freedom. This is a lesson which all developing countries should learn.
<P>	For example, Hong Kong and Singapore have the highest amount of economic freedom in the world.  In these countries consumers and businesses are free from most government intrusion.  Their economies are based on the mutual consent of individuals to buy, sell, and dispose of property as they see fit.  As a result, they have had extremely high levels of economic growth. Between 1980 and 1991, Hong Kong's gross national product grew at an average rate of 5.6 percent, while Singapore's economy grew at an average rate of 5.3 percent over the same period. While their economic wealth is less than that of some industrial democracies, Singapore's and Hong Kong's economies are catching up quickly with the Western world.  These countries someday may even surpass the U.S. and Germany in per capita GDP if current trends continue.
<P>	In contrast, countries like Angola, Bangladesh, and Haiti have the least amount of economic growth.  These countries have done little to unleash the entrepreneurial forces in their economies.  Instead, they have followed the self-destructive path of central government control and state intervention in the economy.  As a result, they are among the world's poorest nations. Other countries scored poorly as well, such as the newly formed independent republics of Belarus, Moldova, and Ukraine.  Their problems stem from slow progress toward free market reforms.  Their economic problems are the worst in the former Soviet Union. 
<P>	Former Marxist countries which have made rapid progress toward maximizing economic freedom are doing relatively well: the Czech Republic and Estonia, for example, score well on the Index.  The Czech Republic has halted an economic decline. It probably will have a respectable growth rate of 3 percent in 1994.  The Bank of Estonia estimates the GDP growth will be in the 3 percent to 5 percent range in 1994.  These countries have managed to begin the process used by Hong Kong and Singapore to promote large economic growth rates by maximizing economic freedom.
<P>	Above all, these findings disprove the assertion that economic growth can be bought by huge transfers of wealth from the industrialized economies to the less developed world.  People in Angola, Mozambique, Haiti, and Ukraine are not poor because wealthy people in the West do not share their riches.  They are poor because their governments pursue destructive economic policies that depress free enterprise.  Only when poor countries increase the economic freedom of their citizens and unleash the phenomenal power of the free market will true prosperity come to the poor nations of the world. Anything short of this is not only economically unwise, but inhumane.

<H3>Why an Index of Economic Freedom?</H3>
<HR SIZE=3>
<P>	The U.S. Agency for International Development (AID) for years has been giving aid to 
developing countries whose economies are over-regulated, protected by trade barriers, and state-
controlled. Nevertheless, despite billions of dollars of U.S. development aid, most of these countries 
are still poor. The reason is simple: their governments have done little to promote economic 
freedom. Quite simply, the recipient countries are destroying their own economies.  Not only has 
U.S. development aid been wasted, it has actually retarded economic development in the countries 
that receive it. Not one country receiving foreign aid has succeeded in developing sustained 
economic growth.
<P>	It should be no surprise that U.S. aid has done so little to bring about global economic growth. 
The experience of the past three decades shows that economic policy, not aid, is the main factor in 
moving from the ranks of developing to middle and high income countries. For example, the economies 
of Hong Kong and Singapore, two of the "Asian Tigers," expanded their gross domestic product by a rate 
of 6 percent each year between 1960 and 1985.  During this period of rapid development, neither Hong 
Kong nor Singapore received significant amounts of development aid.
<P>	Indeed, these and other Asian countries would not have grown so much if the crutch of foreign 
aid had been available.  If Hong Kong had been flooded with aid, as was Tanzania, it probably would be 
closer to Tanzania's status as the world's second poorest country.  In reality, Hong Kong is one of the 
world's most dynamic economies, growing at an average annual rate of 5.6 percent from 1980 to 1991. 
<P>	The potentially perverse effect of development can be seen in the recent history of Chile. In 
1973, Chile was the world's second largest recipient of foreign aid.  It also had a stagnating economy. 
Under the leadership of Marxist President Salvador Allende, Chile's GDP shrank 5.6 percent in 1973.  As 
with many Latin American countries, the government controlled a large part of the Chilean economy, 
estimated to be around 75 percent of the GDP.
<P>	However, by 1990, Chile's economy changed dramatically.  General Augusto Pinochet launched 
a market reform program that drastically cut back on government intervention in the economy. The 
Chilean government controlled only 25 percent of the economy after Pinochet's privatization program 
was largely complete. As a result, Chile has developed one of the fastest growing economies in the world.  
A GDP growth rate averaging 7.3 percent per year since 1988 has dramatically improved the lives of the 
Chilean people. For example, the infant mortality rate has been reduced as life expectancy has gone up.
<P>	It was with this understanding of economic development in mind that the authors undertook to 
measure the relative economic freedom of most countries in the world. The <I>Index of Economic 
Freedom</I> represents an excellent tool for deciding how best to allocate development aid.  Using it 
would help to ensure that foreign aid is not sent to countries that repress economic freedom and have no 
chance of growing economically.  Countries scoring well or improving on the<I> Index</I> would be 
eligible for development aid if they were using the money in constructive ways--i.e., to help construct the 
building blocks of a free market economy. However, using aid to pay for building stock markets, a banking 
system, and other elements of a free market will always be dwarfed in importance when compared to the 
economic policy decisions of the host country. The greatest advantage of the Index is to ensure that U.S. 
development aid does no harm and is not wasted on countries that demonstrate no commitment to 
economic reform.
<P>	The<I> Index of Economic Freedom</I> is not a tool for deciding whether or not to dispense 
humanitarian aid or to promise aid for reasons of national security. A foreign country's economic 
policies have always been and undoubtedly will continue to be irrelevant when deciding whether to offer 
relief to people suffering from hurricanes, earthquakes, and other natural disasters. Moreover, for reasons 
of national security, the U.S. should continue providing foreign aid when necessary to bolster allies 
abroad.
<P>	There is yet another use for the <I>Index</I>.  Investors around the world would benefit from 
knowing  how well countries score on the "fundamentals" of economic freedom.  Although the<I> 
Index</I> would be of  little use in judging the advisability of specific investments or in discerning the 
relative strength of specific business sectors, it could be useful in understanding the overall economic 
environment inside a country and whether the economic trends are favorable to future investments.  
Moreover, the <I>Index</I> would be more useful as a starting place in judging investment opportunities 
in underdeveloped countries than in the advanced democracies.  The relative economic performances of 
underdeveloped countries tend to be less known than those of Western nations.  And perhaps more 
important, an understanding of the economic "fundamentals" would be more important in assessing risk 
for the lesser developed nations.   The economies of poorer countries tend to be unpredictable and 
difficult for investors to understand.  The <I>Index</I> should help them to improve their understanding.

<P>	The U.S. will spend over $13 billion on foreign aid in 1994.  This brings total U.S. bilateral aid      
since 1946 to close to half a trillion dollars.  Of the $13 billion spent in 1994, AID will distribute $2.4      
billion in bilateral economic assistance directly to specific countries.  In addition, the U.S. will give almost a billion dollars in economic support to the former Soviet Union, $1.9 billion through international financial institutions including the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank, and $2.4 billion in Economic Support Funds (ESF), which are used to advance U.S. political and security interests.

<H3>Where We Are Going in Foreign Aid</H3>  
<HR SIZE=3>  
<P>	The Clinton Administration in 1994 made a bid to reform foreign aid. After countless   
commissions and blue ribbon panels over the years, President Clinton introduced the Peace,   
Prosperity, and Democracy Act of 1994 (PPDA).  Many thought this would be the year in which   
the foreign aid program would finally be revamped.  
<P>	This, however, was not to be. The Clinton foreign aid reform plan ran out of steam, falling prey to   
politics and other priorities. The Senate Democratic leadership was unwilling to devote the floor time that   
the PPDA required. The reason: doing so would have given Clinton critics a stage for complaints against   
the President's foreign policy. Senate Democrats also were hesitant to direct congressional attention   
away from the health care debate.  Thus, the PPDA never made it to the floor for a vote.  
<P>	The PPDA was a weak attempt to reform foreign aid. It failed to address one of the fundamental   
problems of development aid: how best to use foreign aid to advance economic freedom and, as a result,   
spur economic development. <FONT SIZE="-2">(1)</FONT>   The central idea of the Clinton reform  
plan was something called   
"sustainable development." In this idea, the state manages the economy, trying to create "sustainable"   
economic growth without harming the environment or unleashing a "population explosion." But the results   
of this approach will be the exact opposite of the free market-driven growth the Administration claims to   
champion. By increasing government intervention in the economy--with intrusive environmental   
regulations and industrial policies--the Clinton plan will only strangle economic growth.  
<P>	The battle over reforming foreign aid is by no means over. AID Administrator J. Brian Atwood   
believes that the U.S. foreign aid program must be reformed or face budget cuts by skeptical legislators.   
But for foreign aid reform to succeed, more will have to be done than pouring old wine into new bottles,   
as the Clinton Administration has done. The greatest weakness of the Clinton approach is that it continues   
to give aid to countries that waste it.  Moreover, the programming emphasis of the Administration is   
wrong, focusing largely on population control and environmental protection efforts, not on economic   
growth.  Unless the purpose of U.S. development aid is to spur free market-reforms and economic   
growth, it will only prop up failing economies, doing more harm than good.  
<P>	The Index of Economic Freedom is the ideal mechanism for judging which countries should   
receive foreign aid. This was the conclusion of George M. Ferris, Jr., Chairman of the President's   
Commission on the Management of Aid Programs (1992), who urged AID to establish an Index of   
Economic Freedom for the purpose of allocating development aid among countries. Representative   
Robert Livingston, then ranking minority member of the House Appropriations Foreign Operations   
<P>Subcommittee, stated on the House floor last spring that the Republican Party should "expand on [the   
Index of Economic Freedom] and ultimately adopt it in our foreign aid program."<FONT SIZE="-2"> 
(2)</FONT>    
<P>	The Index of Economic Freedom, rooted in the recognition that free markets are the only means   
toward development, should be the foundation of U.S. foreign aid reform legislation. By using the Index,   
policymakers can identify which countries are making progress toward free market reforms and which   
ones are not. Countries reforming their economies could use specially targeted aid to help build market   
institutions. Aid also could provide leverage in persuading developing countries to make market reforms.   
While it may be true that reforming countries over time will have less need for foreign aid, temporary   
assistance can help jump start the process of reform. The ultimate and ideal goal, however, should be to   
end dependence on aid altogether. It is with this goal in mind that the Index of Economic Freedom was   
developed.

<H3>Factors of the Index of Economic Freedom</H3>   
<HR SIZE=3>  
<P>	There are many factors that could be used to determine how much economic freedom    
exists in a country.  Economic relations between individuals are restricted to a varying degree by    
government intervention.  By looking at such economic factors as taxes, international trade, and    
banking, the extent to which economic freedom is encouraged or hindered can be discerned.    
</P>










<P><UL>
<B>Factors of the Index of Economic Freedom</B><BR>
1. Trade Policy<BR>
2. Taxation Policy<BR>
3. Government Consumption of Economic Output<BR>
4. Monetary Policy<BR>
5. Capital Flows and Foreign Investment<BR>
 6. Banking Policy<BR>
7. Wage and Price Controls<BR>
8. Property Rights<BR>
9. Regulation Policy<BR>
10. Black Market</UL>

<P><B>The Grading Scale.</B> Under each factor is a grading scale.  The scale runs from 1 to 5 with    
1 being the most free and 5 the least free. After each score is either a "-," "+," or "stable" mark.  These    
indicate whether a country is getting worse, better, or staying the same, respectively, in each category.   
<P>	Countries were ranked according to four categories of economic freedom.  Countries receiving    
an Index score of 1.99 or less are considered to have economies that are "free."  Countries scoring    
between 2.00 and 2.99 have economies that are "mostly free."  For scores of between 3.00 and 3.99,    
economies were ranked as "mostly not free."  And economies that obtained a score of 4.00 and above are    
"repressed."   
<P><B>The Sources.</B> In grading the countries, the most recent available information and statistical    
data were used. Where primary sources were not available, secondary sources were used. These cases are    
footnoted accordingly. In each section, a general list of sources is provided for each country. Unless    
otherwise footnoted, these are the main sources used to grade each of the countries.  A general    
bibliography appears at the end of the study.   
<P><B>	Choosing Which Countries to Score.</B> One of the prime motives for developing    
the Index of Economic Freedom is to provide policy makers with a guide for dispensing aid among    
countries. Thus, this edition of the Index rates most current or traditional recipients of significant ($5    
million annually) amounts of U.S. foreign aid.  Some countries, such as Rwanda, Somalia, and Zaire, were    
omitted mainly because reliable data to score their economies were not available. However, this poses no    
significant problem because U.S. aid to these countries is strictly humanitarian; by no measure is it    
contributing to sustained economic growth. Some major industrial and trading countries are included,    
largely for a point of comparison. As the results demonstrate, the respect these countries show for    
economic freedom generally stands in stark contrast to that of countries of the developing world.    
Additionally, a few countries of strategic importance to the U.S., including Mexico and China, were    
included. Future editions of <I>The Index of Economic Freedom</I> might consider even more than the    
current 101 countries.   
<H3>THE FACTORS<BR>   
Factor #1: Trade Policy.<FONT SIZE="-3">[1]</FONT> </H3>      
<P>	Trade policy is a key factor in measuring economic freedom. The degree to which a government    
hinders the free flow of foreign commerce has a direct bearing on economic growth. Trade policy, in fact,    
is a key factor in industrialization of developing economies. <FONT SIZE="-2">[2]</FONT>     
International trade enables a country's    
industries to maximize production by allowing them to import raw materials and foreign goods and    
services that are cheaper than those produced at home. It can also offer a country greater access to a large    
world market, which can be the source of much wealth.   
<P><B>	Methodology:</B> The average tariff rate is used to score a country's trade policy. A    
score of 1 through 5 is given based on a country's tariff rate--the higher the tariff rate, the worse the    
score. Sources to determine the average tariff rate were derived from reports issued by the General    
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  When the average    
tariff rate was not available in these sources, the authors determined the average rate by calculating the    
revenue raised from tariffs and duties as a percentage of total imports. Most of the average tariff rates are    
valid for 1992. In some cases, adequate average tariff rate figures do not exist.  In these cases, the authors    
used publications from the United States Trade Representative's office, the Commerce Department, and    
the State Department. These instances are footnoted. <FONT SIZE="-2">[3]</FONT>  Such non-tariff   
barriers as trade quotas, overly    
strict licensing, or import inspections also were examined. If they existed in sufficient quantity, a    
country's score based solely on tariff rates was moved one point higher on the scale, representing    
decreased economic freedom.   
<P><B>	Example:</B> The U.S. has an average tariff rate of 3.6 percent.  Based on a scale    
measuring tariffs alone, it would be given a score of 1.  However, because the U.S. maintains non-tariff    
barriers, such as import quotas on textiles and sugar, it was given a total score of 2.   
<H3>Grading Scale</H3>   




























<BR>
<BR><PRE>
	Levels 		  
	of 
Score	Protectionism	Criteria	
-----	-------------	--------
1	Very low	Average tariff rates less than 4 percent
			and/or very low non-tariff barriers. 

2	Low		Average tariff rate 5 percent to 9 percent 
			and/or low non-tariff barriers.  

3	Moderate	Average tariff rate 10 percent to 14 
			percent and/or moderate non-tariff barriers.  

4	High		Average tariff rate 15 percent to 19
			percent and/ or high non-tariff barriers.  

5	Very high	Average tariff rate 20 percent and higher 
			and/or very high non-tariff barriers that 
			virtually close the market to imports.  
</PRE>   
  

<H3>Factor #2: Taxation. <FONT SIZE="-3">[4]</FONT> </H3>      
<P>	Taxes are a key factor in measuring economic freedom. While every country taxes economic    
activity to pay for national defense, public health, and other vital government services, too much taxation    
stifles individual entrepreneurship. A tax is essentially a government-imposed disincentive to perform the    
activity being taxed. For this reason, exorbitant taxes slow economic growth. When analyzing this factor,    
taxes on corporate profits, income, and other significant activities are measured.   
<P><B>	Methodology:</B> Two types of taxation are scored: income taxes and corporate    
taxes.  Each country was first scored based on these two major types of taxation, which many economists    
agree have the most negative economic impact on individuals.  These scores were then averaged to get a    
single taxation score.  Then, other taxes such as value-added taxes, sales taxes, and state and local taxes    
also were examined. If they existed in sufficient quantity, a country's taxation score was moved one-half    
point higher on the scale, representing decreased economic freedom.  This one-half point increase    
represents the relative impact of these other taxes on individual freedom.   
<H3>	1) Income taxes.</H3>    
<P>	Some countries have relatively high top income tax rates, but they apply to very few people. For    
example, Japan has a top income tax rate of 50 percent, but it is levied on such large amounts of income    
that very few people fall into this high tax bracket. The tax rate that applies to the average Japanese    
taxpayer is much lower.  Thus, to more accurately measure taxation policy, it is necessary to examine not    
only the top income tax rate, but the rate that applies to the average taxpayer.   
<P>	To discover the average income tax rate, a country's total gross domestic product was divided by    
total population. This per capita income figure was then used to determine which tax rate applies to the    
average income level. <FONT SIZE="-2">[5]</FONT>  Once this was done, each country was scored on   
1) the top tax rate and 2) the    
tax rate that applies to average income.   
<P><B>	Example:</B>  Japan has a top income tax rate of 50 percent.  But the 50 percent tax    
bracket applies to income levels that equal about $180,000, which is more than nine times the per capita    
GDP level, which is around $19,000.  The tax level that applies to that amount is 20 percent.  Thus, based    
on the tax scale, Japan would receive an income tax score of 4.   
<H3>	Income Tax Grading Scale  </H3>   
<P>This scale lists a score from 1 through 5. The higher the score, the higher the tax rate. The highest    
level for which a country qualifies is the score that the country receives.   
 <P>  






























<BR>
<BR><PRE>
Score	Tax Rates	Criteria   
-----	---------	--------

1	Very low taxes	No taxes on income; or A flat tax rate on income  
			of 10 percent or less.  

2	Low taxes	A top tax rate of 25 percent or below; or A flat 
			income tax between 10 percent and 20 percent; 
			or A top rate of 40 percent or below, and a tax on    
			average income below 10 percent.  

3	Moderate taxes	A top tax rate of 35 percent or below; or 
			A tax on  average income below 15 percent.   

4	High Taxes	A top income tax rate of 36 percent to 50 percent 
			and an average tax level of 15 percent to 20 percent. 

5	Very high taxes	A top rate above 50 percent and a tax on average 
			income between 20 percent and 25 percent; or A tax 	
			rate on average income of 25 percent or   
			above regardless of the top rate.  
</PRE>

<H3>	2) Corporate taxes. </H3>   
<P>	The second type of tax analyzed is the corporate tax. Each country is scored according to a    
sliding scale based on corporate tax rates.    
<P><B>	Example:</B> Japan has a top corporate tax rate of 37.5 percent. Thus, based on the    
corporate tax rate scale, Japan receives a score of 4.  Japan's overall tax score average is a 4.  But Japan    
maintains additional taxes in the form of a 37.5 capital gains tax, a 3 percent consumption tax, a 17.3    
percent to 20.7 percent local inhabitant tax, and a 14.6 percent social contributions tax.  Thus, Japan    
moves from a 4 to a 4.5.

Score	Tax Rates	Criteria
-----	---------	--------	

1	Very low taxes	Considered a tax haven.  Limited or no taxes are

2 	Low taxes  	Flat corporate tax less than 25 percent or a 	
			progressive top tax of less than 25 percent.

3	Moderate taxes	A progressive corporate tax system with top rate

			between 36 percent and 45 percent.

5	Very high taxes	A cumbersome progressive tax system with top  
			corporate tax rates above 46 percent.
</PRE>

<H3>Factor #3: Government Consumption of Economic Output. <FONT SIZE="-3">[6]</FONT>     
</H3>   
<P>	The greater the degree to which the government intrudes in the economy, the less individuals are    
free to engage in their own economic activities. By taking government consumption as a percentage of    
gross domestic product, the level of government consumption of economic output can be determined. The    
higher the rate of government consumption as a percentage of gross domestic product, the higher the    
Index score, and hence the lower the economic freedom.   
<P><B>	Methodology:</B> Measuring a country's government consumption as a percentage of    
GDP reveals only an approximation of the government's role in the economy. <FONT SIZE="-2">  
[7]</FONT>  In the U.S., for    
example, the federal budget is about 24 percent of GDP.  This figure includes servicing the federal budget    
deficit and transfer payments through entitlements like Medicaid. Other government consumption figures    
for most less developed countries do not include funds spent on servicing the budget deficit and some    
transfer payments. While using government consumption figures probably understates the total    
government intervention in the economy, it is a useful tool and starting point for gauging the degree of    
government intervention in the economy.   
<P>	The next step in scoring a country on government consumption is to determine the size of the    
state-owned sector of the economy. If  a large portion of a country's GDP is produced by the state-owned    
sector, it was moved one point higher on the scale, representing decreased economic freedom.    
<P><B>	Example:</B>  Russia has a government consumption as a percentage of GDP figure    
of about 22 percent.  This would give Russia a score of 2 because the government consumption figure is    
between 11 percent and 25 percent. However, state-owned enterprises account for a majority of industrial    
production.  Thus, Russia gets a final score of 3, one point higher.   
   
<H3>Grading Scale</H3>

	Consumption of

-----	---------------		--------	

1	Very low 		Less than 10 percent of GDP.

2	Low 			11 percent to 25 percent of GDP.

3	Moderate 		26 percent to 35 percent of GDP.

4	High 			36 percent to 45 percent of GDP.

5	Very high 		46 percent or above of GDP.  

</PRE>

<H3>Factor #4: Monetary Policy. <FONT SIZE="-3">[8]</FONT>  </H3>   
<P>	The value of a country's currency is based largely on the government's monetary policy. If a    
government maintains a "tight" monetary policy, meaning the supply of currency does not exceed demand,    
individuals have the economic freedom to engage in productive and profitable economic activities.  If the    
government maintains a "loose" monetary policy, meaning it supplies more money than demand requires,    
money loses its value and individuals are less free to engage in productive and profitable economic    
activities.  The best way to measure monetary policy is to analyze a country's inflation rate over a period    
of time. The inflation rate is directly linked to the government's ability to manage the supply of money in    
the economy.   
<P><B>	Methodology:</B> The average inflation rate was the main criterion for this factor.    
The inflation rate is the best measure of how a country manages its money supply.  Countries with high    
inflation rates have a loose monetary policy and are graded higher because they have less economic    
freedom than countries with lower inflation rates. Countries with a low inflation rate have a tight    
monetary policy and are graded lower because they have more economic freedom.  Countries of the    
former Soviet Union pose a unique problem in determining average inflation rates.  Due to the fact that    
these countries had command economies, annual inflation rate averages from 1980 to 1991 are    
misleading.  Without a market-based system, prices can be held constant because they are controlled by    
the state.  Therefore, countries of the former Soviet Union are graded solely based on 1992 or 1993    
inflation figures.  While these figures are high, especially due to their transformation to a market-based    
system, they are more accurate reflections of the conditions of today than are figures from the Soviet era.   
<P><B>	Example:</B>  Japan keeps a tight control over its money supply, and low inflation    
rates are the result. Japan's government has done this by maintaining a supply of yen consistent with the    
domestic demand for the currency.  In addition, Japan has very high savings rates. This supplies the    
financial system with yen that banks and other institutions lend to borrowers. As a result of a tight    
monetary policy, Japan maintained a very low average annual inflation rate of 1.5 percent from 1980 to    
1991. Because of its low inflation rate, Japan receives the lowest score of 1.    
   
<H3>Grading Scale</H3>   























<PRE>
Score 	Inflation Rate		Criteria
-----	--------------		--------

1	Very low		Below 6 percent.

2	Low			Between 7 percent and 13 percent.

3	Moderate 		Between 14 percent and 20 percent.

4	High			Between 21 percent and 30 percent.

5	Very high		Over 30 percent.
</PRE>

		  
<H3>Factor #5: Capital Flows and Foreign Investment Policy. <FONT SIZE="-2">[9]</FONT>  </H3>   
<P>	Foreign investment funds economic expansion. Investors from abroad supply capital to domestic    
investors who then start or expand their businesses. Restrictions on foreign investment hamper economic    
freedom and thus limit the inflow of foreign capital. By contrast, few or no restrictions on foreign    
investment maximize economic freedom and thus increase the flow of investments. For this category, the    
more restrictions a country imposes on foreign investment, the higher the score, and hence the lower the    
economic freedom.   
<P><B>	Methodology.</B> A country's foreign investment policies were scrutinized in order    
to determine the overall investment climate. Among the specific questions asked: Are there foreign    
ownership limits placed on domestic industries? Is there an existing foreign investment code that defines    
the country's investment laws and procedures? Does the government encourage foreign investment by    
providing tax holidays or other incentives? Are foreign corporations treated under the law the same as    
domestic corporations? Are specific industries closed to foreign investment? These questions were    
answered to develop an overall description of the investment climate of the country being examined.     
Each country was graded based on its investment climate.   
<P><B>	Example:</B> Venezuela maintains restrictions on foreign investment.  Foreigners can    
own no more than 20 percent of a company engaged in one of the following industries: accounting,    
architecture, engineering, and insurance.  Foreign investment in oil, gas, coal, petroleum, automobiles,    
and iron ore is prohibited.  Finally, there are some employment restrictions.  On some investments, the    
workforce of a company with more than 10 employees must be 90 percent Venezuelan.  Thus, according    
to the criteria in the scale below, these restrictions are considered as moderately restrictive. Venezuela is    
given a score of 3 because there are restrictions on investment, but government policy at least conforms    
to established foreign investment codes.

			natural resources.

3	Moderate	Restrictions on many investments, but

4	High 		Investments permitted on a case-by-case

<H3>Factor #6: Banking. <FONT SIZE="-3">[10]</FONT>   </H3>   
<P>	In most countries, banks provide the economy with the financial means to operate.  They lend    
money to start businesses, provide services such as real estate, insurance, and securities investments, and    
furnish a safe place for individuals to store their earnings.  The more government controls banks, the less    
they are free to engage in these activities. The consequence of heavy regulation of banks is restricted    
economic freedom. Therefore, the more a government restricts its banking sector, the higher the Index    
score it receives, and hence the lower the economic freedom.   
<P><B>	Methodology.</B> This factor is measured by determining the openness of a country's    
banking system. Among the questions asked: Are foreign banks able to operate freely?  How difficult is it    
to open domestic banks?  How heavily regulated is the banking system?  Are banks free to provide    
customers with insurance, sell real estate, and invest in securities?  The answers to these questions were    
used to develop a description of the country's banking climate.  The Index represents a sliding scale that    
measures the relative openness of a country's banking system.   
<P>	Example: The U.S. banking system is minimally regulated.  However, it maintains federal    
deposit insurance and interstate banking regulations.  Based on the scale below, the U.S. receives a 2    
score, which means that restrictions on banks are considered to be low.

	Restrictions	
Score 	on Banks	Criteria
-----	--------	--------

1	Very low 	Very few restrictions on foreign banks.  Banks can 	
			engage in all types of financial services.  
			Government controls few, if any, commercial banks. 
			No government deposit insurance.

2	Low 		Few limits on foreign banks. The country may 
			maintain some limits on financial services and have 
			interstate banking restrictions and deposit insurance. 
			Domestic bank formation may face some barriers.

3	Moderate 	Barriers to new bank formation. Heavy influence on 	
			banks by government.  Government owns or 
			operates some banks. Strict government control of 	
			credit.  Domestic bank formation may face 	
			significant barriers.

4	High 		Banks tightly controlled by government. Corruption 	
			may be present.  Domestic bank formation is 								virtually nonexistent.

5	Very High 	Financial institutions in chaos. Corruption rampant.

</PRE>

<H3>Factor #7: Wage and Price Controls. <FONT SIZE="-3">[11]</FONT>  </H3>   
<P>	A free economy is one that allows individuals to set not only the prices on the goods and services    
they sell, but also the wages they pay to the workers they employ.  Some governments mandate wage and    
price controls. By doing so, they restrict economic activity, and thus curtail economic freedom.    
Therefore, the more a government intervenes and controls prices and wages, the higher the Index score    
and the lower the economic freedom.   
<P><B>	Methodology:</B>  This factor is measured by how much a country lets the market or    
the government set wages and prices. Among specific questions asked: Are there any products whose    
prices are set by the government?  If so, which products?  Does the government affect prices by    
controlling such things as utilities?  Does the government have a minimum wage policy?  Are other wages    
set by the government? A sliding scale is developed to measure the relative degree of government control    
over wages and prices. A 1 or "very low" score represents wages and prices being set completely by the    
market, whereas at the other end of the scale, a "very high" score of 5 means that wages and prices are set    
completely by the government.   
<P><B>	Example:</B>  In Hong Kong, all wages and prices are determined by the market. Thus,    
it receives a score of 1. By contrast, in Cuba, wages and prices are set by the government. Therefore, it    
receives a score of 5.

			minimum wage laws.

3	Moderate	Mixture of market forces and government-

4	High		Rationing, wage and price controls on most jobs and

<H3>Factor #8: Property Rights. <FONT SIZE="-3">[12]</FONT>  </H3>   
<P>	The accumulation of private property is the main motivating force in a market economy.  This    
factor examines the extent to which private property is protected by the government and how safe it is    
from expropriation.  The less protection private property receives, the higher the score, and hence the    
lower the economic freedom.   
<P><B>	Methodology:</B> The degree to which private property is a guaranteed right is    
measured. So, too, is the extent to which the government protects and enforces laws to protect private    
property. The probability that the state will expropriate private property also is examined. The less legal    
protection of private property, the higher the score.  The higher the chance of government expropriation    
of private property, the higher the score.   
<P><B>	Example:</B> The U.S. economic system is based entirely on people's right to    
accumulate property. America's legal system is one of the best in the world. It allows people to use the    
court system for disputes over property and to enforce contracts. Thus, based on the scale below, the U.S.    
would receive a very low score of 1, meaning that the level of protection for private property is "very    
high."

	Protection of
Score 	Private Property	Criteria
-----	----------------	--------

1	Very high		Private property guaranteed by the
				government, and efficient court system 
				enforces contracts. Adequate justice system 
				to punish those who unlawfully confiscate 
				private property. Expropriation not likely.

2	High			Private property guaranteed by the 	
				government, but enforcement is lax. 
				Expropriation unlikely.

3	Moderate		Government recognizes some private 
				property rights, such as land, but property 
				can be nationalized. Expropriation possible.

4	Low 			Property ownership is limited to personal 	
				items with little legal protection.  	
				Communal property is the rule.  
				Expropriation likely, and the government 
				does not adequately protect private
				property.  The legal system has collapsed.

5	Nonexistent		Private property is outlawed. Everything 	
				belongs to the people or the state.  	
				Expropriation is certain, or the country is 
				so corrupt and chaotic that property 
				protection is nonexistent.


</PRE>

<H3>Factor #9: Regulation. <FONT SIZE="-3">[13]</FONT>  </H3>     
<P>	In many less developed economies, obtaining a business license to sell a good or service is    
nearly impossible.  With so many hoops for the entrepreneur to jump through, it is very difficult to create    
new businesses. In some cases, government officials frown upon private sector initiative and it may even    
be illegal. While there are many regulations that hinder business, the most important ones are those    
associated with licensing new companies and businesses.  In some countries, like the U.S., obtaining a    
business license is as simple as mailing in a registration form with a minimal fee.  In others, especially in    
Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of South America, obtaining a business license requires endless trips to a    
government building and countless bribes, and may take up to a year.    
<P>	Once a business is open, that is not necessarily the end of government regulation.  In some cases,    
it is just the beginning.  Some countries apply their regulations haphazardly.  For example, an    
environmental regulation may be used to shut down one business while another is not penalized. Business    
owners become confused over which regulations must be obeyed. Moreover, the existence of many    
regulations can cause corruption as confused and harassed business owners try to work around the red    
tape.   
<P><B>	Methodology:</B>  The purpose is to measure how easy or difficult it is to open a    
business.  The more regulations on business, the harder it is to open.  In addition, the degree of corruption    
was examined, as was whether the regulations are applied uniformly to all businesses. Another factor was    
whether the country has any state planning agencies that set production limits and quotas. The scale was    
established by listing a set of conditions for each of the five possible scores.  These conditions include    
such items as the extent of government corruption, the uniformity of the regulations' applications, and the    
extent to which the regulations pose a burden on business. At one end of the scale is the 1 score of very    
low levels of regulation, where corruption is nonexistent and regulations are minimal and uniformly    
applied. At the other end of the scale is the "very high" score of 5, where corruption is rampant,    
regulations are applied randomly, and the general level of regulation is very high. A country need only    
meet a majority of the conditions in each score for it to receive that score.   
<P><B>	Example:</B>  Obtaining a business license in Hong Kong is very easy.  In some cases,    
one can even be obtained by mail. Hong Kong's regulation system is corruption-free, not a burden to    
business, and is applied uniformly throughout the country. Thus, Hong Kong receives a 1.

<H3>Factor #10: Black Market. </H3>   
<P>	Black markets are a direct result of government intervention in the market. In fact, a black market    
activity is one that the government has outlawed.  The larger the black market is in a country, the lower the    
economic freedom.  The smaller the black market, the higher the economic freedom.  This factor    
considers the size of a country's black market as a percentage of GDP.  The higher the percentage, the    
higher the score and the lower the economic freedom.   
<P><B>	Methodology.</B> Information available on the size of black markets in less    
developed countries is extremely scarce. Nevertheless, estimates can be made on the size of black market    
activities by answering several questions. For example, does the country have a large smuggling market?     
If so, this could be an indication that the government imposes too many restrictions on foreign imports.    
Do consumers need to turn to the black market to buy such items as televisions and video-cassette    
recorders?  If so, this could be an indication that these products cannot be bought in stores legally or that    
their prices are too high because of very high tariffs. Are there large numbers of workers who work    
illegally?  If so, this could be an indication that the economy is overly regulated and that labor must be    
supplied by the black market.   
<P>	The existence or absence of these and other activities was used to estimate the size of the black    
market as a percentage of gross domestic product.  In cases where black market information exists for    
specific countries, it is noted. At one end of the scale is the score of 1, where the black market    
constitutes less than 10 percent of GDP. At the other end is the score of 5, where the black market makes    
up 30 percent or more of GDP.   
<P><B>	Example:</B> In Peru, almost 30 percent of the GDP consists of such black market    
activities as labor and food. Other black market activities are outlawed in many cases. Peru receives the    
highest score of 5.

<H2>The Countries</H2>
<HR SIZE=2>

<P>	This section is a compilation of countries, each graded in all ten factors of the Index of 
Economic Freedom. Each country receives a 1 through 5 score for all ten factors. Those scores are then 
averaged to get a final Index of Economic Freedom score. Countries with a score between 1 and 2 have 
the freest economies. Countries with a score around 3 are less free. Countries with a score near 4 are 
over-regulated and need significant economic reforms to achieve even the most basic increases in 
economic growth. Countries with a 5 score are the most economically oppressive nations in the world.

<H2>Conclusion </H2>
<HR SIZE=2>

<P>	This study demonstrates that the countries with free economic systems enjoy the highest 
degree of economic development.  Likewise, the countries with the least amount of economic 
freedom suffer from the lowest degree of economic development and are among the poorest 
countries on earth.  Throughout the world, free markets have driven development, while heavy 
government intervention has wrought nothing but economic disaster.
<P>	These conclusions are reflected in the scores of 101 countries examined in the <I>Index of 
Economic Freedom</I>. 7 countries were given  a "free" score, while 36 were found to be "mostly free." 
By contrast, 50 nations were "mostly not free," while 8 were deemed as "repressed." As these 
designations show, most of the countries in the world have economies that are not free. 
<P>	The <I>Index</I> demonstrates clearly the positive relationship between economic freedom and 
wealth. Five of the seven advanced industrial (G-7) democracies are among the ten countries whose Index 
score reflects the most economic freedom. By contrast, countries with unfree economies, such as Cuba, 
Mozambique, North Korea, and Vietnam, are among the world's poorest. Predictably Mozambique is 
indeed the world's poorest country.  While Mozambique's long running civil war, which ended in 1992, 
contributed to its poverty, there can be no doubt that Mozambique's long embrace of Marxism has been 
the major cause of its abysmal state of economic development.
<P>	<B>Asian Powerhouses. </B> Nor is it surprising that the Asian "Tigers"--Hong Kong, South 
Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan--are doing well economically. Two members of this enviable group, Hong 
Kong and Singapore, tie for the best score on the <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I>.  Each country 
scored a 1.25, receiving identical scores in all but two categories.  Hong Kong edged out Singapore by 
having lower tax rates while Singapore scored better than Hong Kong on monetary policy.  These two 
countries are paragons of economic freedom.
<P>	When compared with growth rates in many African countries, the "Asian Tiger" success is indeed 
impressive.  By 1965, the Asian Tigers and most Sub-Saharan African nations had achieved independence 
from colonial nation states.  In that year, Sub-Saharan African countries like Gabon had equal to higher 
levels of per capita wealth than Asian Tiger countries like the Republic of China on Taiwan.  For example, 
in 1965, Gabon had a per capita GDP figure of $1,286. By contrast, Taiwan had a per capita GDP of 
$1,133.<FONT SIZE="-2">[1]</FONT>   By 1991, Gabon's per capita wealth had risen to only $3,448. By contrast, Taiwan's per capita GDP had climbed to  $9,805. <FONT SIZE="-2">[2]</FONT>
<P>	Since 1965 , Taiwan has received negligible amounts of development aid. Gabon has been flood-
ed with hundreds of millions of dollars of development aid--over $500 million in the past five years. The 
conclusion is inevitable: Taiwan flourished because it became economically free, while Gabon, awash in 
development aid, languished because it refused to steer a free market course.
<P>	Right behind Hong Kong and Singapore, finishing third overall in economic freedom, is Bahrain.  
This Middle Eastern country scored a 1.60. Despite Bahrain's state-owned oil industry it maintains one of 
the most open markets in the world with average tariff rates of around 3.3 percent.  It makes no use of 
non-tariff barriers such as trade quotas and voluntary export restraints.  It taxes neither income nor 
corporate profits. Because of tight monetary policies, Bahrain actually has achieved what economists call  
"negative inflation rates"--in other words, prices actually dropped in the 1980s.
<P>	Bahrain has few government-imposed prices or set wages, minimal restrictions on foreign 
investments, a limited bureaucracy that imposes scant regulations on businesses. Its black market is 
practically non-existent. In each of the categories where countries were ranked, Bahrain scored among the 
best.  Since Bahrain's independence in 1971, it has achieved a per capita GDP of $11,536,
<FONT SIZE="-2">[3]</FONT>  which makes it more wealthy than Ireland.
<P><B>	Nations Emerge from Communism. </B> The <I>Index </I>also sheds light on the 
different economic paths taken by former communist countries. Of the countries graded in this edition of 
the <I>Index, </I>the Czech Republic is ranked among the top 12 in the world with the highest levels of 
economic freedom.<FONT SIZE="-2">[4]</FONT>  Thus, the Czech Republic has the freest economy of all the former East Bloc 
countries. Right behind the Czech Republic is Estonia. Both Estonia and the Czech Republic have adopted 
low rates of taxation, eliminated abusive government regulations, and minimized state constraints on 
individual economic activity. The results are that the economies of these two countries are performing 
better than any other former socialist state.
<P>	Some of the more developed countries have less economic freedom than less prosperous, 
developing countries.  Sweden, for example, scored a relatively weak 2.65.  This score can be attributed to 
Sweden's high level of taxation and the heavy role its government plays in the economy.  Neverthe-less, 
Sweden is wealthier than Malaysia, which scores a 2.15.  Sweden has a per capita GDP amount of 
$17,490, while Malaysia has a per capita GDP figure of $7,400.<FONT SIZE="-2">[5]</FONT> 
<P> 	This finding may seem, at first glance, to invalidate the claim that economic freedom is the most 
important factor in stimulating economic development. However, this would be a misreading of the 
evidence. The Index of Economic Freedom is but a snapshot in time.  It measures economic freedom 
today.  There is no accounting for the economic history of Sweden, nor is Malaysia's past captured in its 
Index score. Sweden is richer than Malaysia, even though it is less free, because Sweden began 
industrialization long before Malaysia. Thus, it has had longer to develop and accumulate wealth. 
However, at present growth rates, it may not be long before Malaysia catches up with Sweden. Malaysia's 
economic growth exceeds Sweden's today, and Malaysia had an average growth rate of 5.6 percent from 
1980 to 1991.  Sweden had an average rate of growth for the same time of 2 percent.
<P><B>	The Curve of Economic Freedom. </B> This comparison of Sweden and Malaysia 
points to an important phenomenon discovered in this study: Long periods of economic growth resulting 
from high levels of economic freedom seem to create states that reverse course and place limits on 
economic freedom.  This is the Curve of Economic Freedom.  As the curve demonstrates, most countries 
with limited levels of economic freedom are grouped together with corresponding low levels of per 
capita wealth.  As some countries begin to reform their economies by establishing market-based systems 
that promote economic growth, per capita wealth increases.  However, once these countries reach a 
certain level of economic prosperity, as in the G-7 countries, they are tempted to regulate their 
economies, raise taxes, and add welfare programs, which results in less economic freedom and slower 
rates of economic growth.
<P>	The Curve of Economic Freedom helps to explain why economic growth rates have lagged lowed 
in the U.S. and Europe since the mid-1980s. Since that time, these countries has increased government 
spending, resulting in corresponding increases in taxation and regulation. If these trends continue, these 
countries will eventually suffer from dwindling economic growth and shrinking per capita wealth. 
<P><B>	Regions of Freedom. </B>North America, parts of Europe, and East Asia have the 
highest amounts of both economic freedom and per capita wealth.  Sub-Saharan Africa, Central America, 
and some republics of the former-Soviet Union are among the least economically free and poorest 
countries in the world.  Yet, while many countries in the developed world have rather high levels of 
economic freedom, many have reimposed restrictions on that freedom while many less developed 
countries have removed impediments to freedom and are beginning to catch up with the advanced 
industrial countries.
<P>	For example, some nations in Europe, mainly Germany, France, Italy, and even the United 
Kingdom to a lesser extent, have economic recessions.  Much of this is a result of increased government 
spending and interference in the economy.  The European Union, for example, will spend about 22 percent 
of its combined GDP on social welfare programs.  This is up from around 16 percent in 1989.  In 
Germany, government spending on social security and welfare now accounts for 49 percent of total 
government expenditures.  In the U.K., social spending is about 33 percent.
<P>	To fund social programs, these countries have raised tax rates to very high levels. Germany, Italy, 
and Japan have top income tax rates over 50 percent.  Britain has a top rate of 40 percent, while that of  
the U.S. is 39.6 percent.  Hong Kong, however, taxes income at a top rate of around 15 percent.  Other 
developing countries, like Estonia, have adopted relatively low top tax rates of 26 percent.
<P><B>	Foreign Aid Failures. </B> The <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I> scores 
represent a damning condemnation of the U.S. foreign aid program.  It is well known that many countries 
which have received the largest amount of economic assistance from the U.S., including India and 
Bangladesh, are also the world's poorest countries.  Sadly, many of these countries are only getting 
poorer, and most policy makers know that the U.S. foreign aid program is doing little or nothing to stop it. 
Indeed, this is why Brian Atwood, the Administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, is 
scrambling to "reinvent" his beleaguered agency.
<P>	It is troubling to learn that the large recipients of U.S. aid are also the countries with the least 
amount of economic freedom.  India, for example, scored a 3.70 and Bangladesh scored even worse at 
3.90.  The dearth of economic freedom permitted in these countries has produced nothing but economic 
misery.  It is tragic that this disastrous course has been subsidized by U.S. foreign aid. 
<P>	The record is particularly damning in Africa. The west African country of Ghana scores a poor 
3.20. Nevertheless, Ghana is the "star" of the international donor community, receiving nearly $1 billion 
in development aid each year. The three Sub-Saharan countries, Swaziland, Uganda, and South Africa, have 
the greatest degree of economic freedom, scoring 2.90, 2.94, and 3.00, respectively. Though good by 
Africa standards, these are bad scores when compared to Western standards. Africa's interventionist 
economic policies have drained it of economic vitality. 
<P>	Israel scored a 3.10 and Egypt 3.50.  These two countries together receive the bulk of U.S. 
foreign aid.  They are scheduled to receive over $5 billion in 1995.  Although each country has spoken of 
economic liberalization, little progress has been made, particularly in Egypt, where a reform effort has 
run out of steam.  U.S. aid to these two countries may be justified in terms of U.S. national security.  The 
peaceful relationship between Israel and Egypt is viewed as the bulwark of Middle East stability.  
However, these considerations aside, there can be no doubt that U.S. aid is doing little to promote 
economic development in these countries. In fact, it may be retarding development by delaying economic 
reforms.
<P>	The U.S. has recently occupied Haiti to restore democracy to that poverty-stricken country.  
Haiti scores a 4.20 on the <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I>.  This amounts to economic repression. 
The Haitian elite has repressed economic activity by every means, including the use of physical violence.  
Haiti's lack of economic freedom has made it the Western Hemisphere's poorest country.  In short, 
Haiti's crisis is as much economic as political. Haiti's <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I> score 
suggests that foreign aid will do nothing to promote economic development unless the Haitian economy 
is dramatically liberalized.
<P>	Finally, nations still under the control of communist dictatorships like Cuba and North Korea, 
and to a lesser extent, Vietnam, collected at the bottom of the Index.  These countries are controlled by 
regimes that repress most forms of economic activity, saving most sources of wealth for corrupt 
government officials who use their control over the economy as the means to maintain power.
<P>	After all is said and done, the inescapable conclusion of the <I>Index of Economic Freedom</I> 
is that the best way for a nation to grow economically is to tax less, lower trade barriers, better protect 
private property, allow foreign investment, and generally reduce the level of government interference in 
the economy. Whether they be G-7 countries or the Asian Tigers, countries that are the wealthiest and 
growing the fastest are the ones that are most economically free.  While many factors in addition to 
economic freedom account for the absolute wealth of nations--such as size, resources, the absence or 
presence of war, and even culture--no single factor is as important in determining economic development.  
The road to riches, it seems, indeed is paved with freedom.

<h1><center>The Center for Political Renewal</center></h1>
<p>

The purpose of the Center for Political Renewal is to examine the revolutionary
changes now underway in American politics and develop the principles and the
agenda that will guide the next majority political coalition. Big Change may lead
to a revolution in American governance and civic affairs.<p>

The work of the Center for Political Renewal consists of two related endeavors:
The work of Foundation distinguished Senior Fellow <a href="/pff/people/sfellow.html#Weber">Vin Weber</a> on his book, The New
Majority; and the work of the Center itself in developing a set of principles and
an agenda to guide the next successful political coalition to produce a
(peaceful) revolution in American governance and civic affairs.<p>

In The New Majority, Weber looks at the current political upheavals from a
historical perspective and outlines the principles of an emerging majority
coalition -- which may be a "new" Democratic party, a "new" Republican party or,
conceivably, a new party by a different name. <p>

Weber's work is reinforced by other Center activities. For example, in November
1994, the Center sponsored a major post-election poll whose stunning results were
reported in <a href="http://www.wsj.com">The Wall Street Journal</a>. Among its findings were that "a tidal wave
of voter discontent with government in general, and <A HREF="http://thomas.loc.gov/home/thomas.html">Congress</A> in particular, was
responsible for the loss of dozens of incumbent Democrats who failed to heed the
warning signs." The study found that by nearly 15 to 1, Americans believe the
Federal government is "much too big and has too much power."<p>

Unfortunately, the budget issue is beginning to lose the attention of the voters.  In the end, success at the polls will not be determined by the poignancy of the issues, but by the amount of interest the issue can muster among voters.  And so, light weight stupid issues like school prayer and smut on the internet become the cause d'jour while important matters like the solvency of our economy are neglected.<br><b>Mark, Staten Island, NY</b><P>

Just shut it down.<br>
It's time to call Clinton's and Paneta's bluff.
Keep up the talk of the "irresponsibility of leaving more debt to our children"on top of the $5 trillion already spent.
<br>Enough is enough!<br><b>Dean, Portland, OR</b><p>

Republicans should stand fast.  Don't get political
cold feet.  You don't need to compromise.
Compromising your principles means violating them!!
That's not what we sent you there to do.
<BR>
Unfortunately, old-bulls like Bob Dole seem to have a
"principle of the day" - whatever seems to be popular.
These are not principles, so we would have to call
wavering Republicans such as Bob Dole unprincipled.
<BR>
I speak for myself and hundreds of others who are tired
of seeing the old-timers run scared from the media, and
the freshman ignored by the Republican leadership.
<BR>
Get your act together guys, or we'll put you out to
pasture as soon as possible!!!
<br><b>Ron, St. Louis, MO</b>
<P>
The Democrats obviously have no desire to balance the budget. They are only playing along because they want to appear to be part of the process. If the Republicans had not gained a majority there would no talk of balanced budget, or welfare reform or Medicare reform from the Democrats. The Republicans should ignore the polls for the next year and keep pushing their budget reform. If the Republicans faulter at this there is a danger of the Democrats retaking the Congress.<br><b>Mark, Pasadena, CA</b><P>

Ronald Reagan once told his budget director, Jim Miller, "Jim, let's just shut it down, and see whether anyone notices!"<br><b>Terry, Toms River, NJ</b><P>

Please DO NOT raise the national DEBT ceiling 1 dollar on our children and grandchildren. I believe AS HAS ALREADY panned out in the media that the Republicians can make NO deals with either the Democrats or the President. Therefore I suggest a strong hand approach in dealing with him, DON'T BUDGE ONE INCH, give him the bills then adjurn congress and go home and let him squell. A week or two of no budget wont cause America to go under,and Him, Morris and his other handlers and so called experts can just scream. Get tuff with the media, show them that Clinton and Dems wont compromise, do your own media blitz. He has already stated he does not like this or that in the bills, face it at every turn he will make Congress look bad, SO PLAY HARDBALL with him. If he calls you back from adjournment TAKE YOUR TIME getting back, let Clinton be the GRINCH THAT STOLE CHRISTMAS. I have learned that NASTY people can only be delt with from a STRONG position and NEVER, NEVER compromise unless THEY are willing to also compromise.<br><b>William, Frederick, MD</b><P>

Quit the cutbacks and start cutting whole departments!
Any bureaucracy not eliminated while we have the chance
will just "grow" itself back within a decade or three.<br><b>Mike, Little Rock, AR</b><P>

 I'm very anxious about the 4.8 trillion dollar dept; particulary when I contemplate the future for my children. As a middle class income earner, I find the tax burden excessive, and quite frankly I'm getting physically and mentally tired. I want the federal government to be downsized, the states to be empowered, and my taxes restributed with more staying in my state.<br><b>Robert, Sierra Vista, AZ</b><P>

Republicans have lost some credibility with me by failing to address some of the more egregious examples of the so-called corporate welfare and special interest subsidies.  But the party has to remain firm in its convictions and continue to stress the benefits of the budget package without feeling that they must respond to the criticisms of the left.
<br>Stay the high ground.<br><b>James, Centerville, OH</b><p>

The Republicans in Congress must stand fast!  They must
withstand the barrage of the criticism of desperate
liberals.  Let Clinton save face by "negotiating" with him 
and making minor conciliations that he can then gloat
over.  As long as the result is a balanced budget, the
citizens of this country are the real winners.<br><b>Louise, Menlo Park, CA</b><P>

<title>A Message From Aspen -- 1/18/95 -- PFF</title>

<h2>Message from Aspen</h2>
<P>
by <a href="/pff/people/sfellow.html#Vlahos">Michael Vlahos</a></center>
<P>
Big Change is upon us.  In America, we have called this <I>revolution</I>.
 Today, it is also called <I>cyberspace</I>.
<P>
Two dozen doyens of big change and the new world met in Aspen
in August.  The theme on the table:  <I>Cyberspace and the American
Dream</I>.  Big Stuff:  an economic revolution, a transformation
of our way of life.  We asked them:  What does this mean for us,
the way we live together, do business, and govern?  Around the
table were some of the first surveyors of the digital landscape.
 It was familiar terrain for all;  so active talk we expected
&#150; and we wrangled and argued for two days about important
things, and about revolution. The last thing we expected to come
out of it all was a ringing, <I>solidarnosc</I> manifesto.
<P>
But something unexpected none the less remained.  A message runs
through the talk.  And it is a message, not for those in the know,
but for regular Americans, those to whom cyberspace is no more
than a breath of esoterica.  It is a message of needed fundamentals,
of things about big change that everyone should know.
<P>
We offer it in the form of the informal, of principles not for
incantation, but for reflection.  Words taken from the talk at
Aspen appear <I>&#147;like this.&#148;</I>
<P>
Here is our message.
<P>
<B><center>Cyberspace is not a medium, but a place.</B></center>
<P>
Before cyberspace, there was <I>the air waves</I>.  The old metaphor
was about how information traveled, how the ether took data packets
from one terminal to another.  And as a metaphor, the air waves
signaled a medium only, an agency that all wished to use;  a common,
and thus shared, instrumentality.
<P>
But cyberspace is a place.  We meet in the ether itself.  For
those who regularly play or do business there, it is even a temporary
habitation.  The new metaphor of a place becomes real;  even though
we are physically separate, our senses connect.  Information is
no longer data, but landscape.  At Aspen, when we reached for
words, they were concrete, world-words:  cyberspace as <I>&#147;ecosystem,&#148;
a new &#147;ecology,&#148;</I> <I>&#147;cyberspace is closer to
a datasphere or space of information.&#148;</I>  It has laid the
same claim on our imagination as a newly discovered country, a
frontier.  It is truly a new world.
<P>
We know it is a place because we think of it as a place.  We act
as though it is a place.  Groups of us meet there; we interact
there:  where <I>interact</I> is merely our new word for being
social.
<P>
Meaning we create human communities there.
<P>
Calling cyberspace a place is our fundamental first principle:
 first to change unstated habits of thought, and then the very
definitions of law.  It means that cyberspace is not a common
medium, a public good; which after the model of <I>the air waves</I>
needs government control and regulation if it is to be shared
as a commons.  Cyberspace is a realm, a sphere of permanent human
gathering and activity.  Primitive it is &#150; a digitally savage
place &#150; but it is, like the earliest American colonies, <B>in
the process of being settled</B>.  Since cyberspace is a created
place, our technology reach endows the possibility of its social
development, of its rise to civilization;  just as the evolution
of ships and the first computers &#150; sextant and astrolabe
&#150; made possible America itself.  So the first colonies in
cyberspace are like any other human experiments at living on a
distant shore.  They are experiments in society itself.
<P>
<B><center>The communities that grow there must be <br>private before they<I>
</I>are public.</B></center>
<P>
These experiments in cyberspace are pioneer communities, and they
may be the first stakeholders of a new society.  Not an alien
culture:  more like an extension of ourselves in a new, but very
different place.  And like any weak and distant settlement, the
new place seems oppressive in its harshness;  and from our far
away vantage &#150; like that of 17th century Londoners &#150;
it all seems primitive and strange.  And it is strange;  and the
unyielding strangeness of an alien world forces human social adaptation.
 People come to this new place with all the inherited social traditions
of late-industrial culture;  and it doesn&#146;t work that way
here.  Others have come in rebellion, or seeking sanctuary from
the tyranny of those traditions.  They want it all to be different.
<P>
What the cyber-colonists share is the desire to adapt, to be able
to be there, and stay there, and make it work.  That drives them;
 and that means, like so many fragile first settlements, that
they will find a way to make it work.  But that means finding
out above all what <I>does</I> work.
<P>
Culture is everywhere in us.  It teaches us how to arrange human
things, how to relate to one another.  And it urges us to make
rules that guide our thinking and our actions.  Law is only the
last form of human rule-making to appear.  Most societies rely
on custom and taboo; they save the law for community theater:
 a mix of teaching and collective observance.
<P>
Social rules &#150; custom and taboo as opposed to law &#150;
have become <I>private</I> in the modern sense:  that is, they
inhere to a community or group only, and are not officially owned
by the national society as a whole.  When social rules inhere
to the national society, they are no longer owned and exercised
by a community of <B>people</B>, but by the national <B>government</B>.
 This is the modern meaning of <I>public</I>.  Long ago, <I>public</I>
referred to the whole of a tribe, in a time when tribe and community
were the same word.  The industrial period separated public from
community.  The new nation state created a formal code of national
law that grew in to a superstructure of life:  it supplanted custom
and taboo for all groups, and replaced social rules with centralized
fiat.  Today, in everyday usage, public no longer means <I>of
the people</I>, it means that particular aspect of government
regulation of <I>everyone&#146;s</I> life.
<P>
Since cyberspace is still seen by America&#146;s centralized authority
as a public medium,  this authority seeks to regulate the new
ether as it did the air waves.  But suppose this authority affirmed
the new metaphor of cyberspace as a realm, colonized by pioneering
settlers?  Would the authority allow the new communities to create
their own rules?  Would it understand that old rules, hardened
into code and statute, might not fit the new place?<HR>

<P>
America&#146;s frontier communities grew up on their own.  The
British Crown did not interfere unduly in their <I>private</I>
life, even as this evolved into civic life, even to the level
of colonial assemblies.  And after we won our independence, young
America let communities continue to make their own rules.
<P>
<I>&#147;We are hearkening back to the old frontier.  At first
they spent an awful lot of time conquering the frontier and building
the frontier and making a society here where there was no one.
 And then they studied politics.&#148;</I>
<P>
Politics as governance should grow out of the traditions of community
rule.  But in industrial America rules have been codified on high,
and are imposed from above.  This reversal of original tradition
is suffered more or less passively by most citizens.  Those sodbusting
in cyberspace, however, are different.  They argue that regulation
for an industrial world will not work in the ether.  And they
are generally more &#145;ornery and defiant than most American
citizens.
<P>
Their message:  to colonize cyberspace,
<P>
<B><center>Custom must precede law.</center></B>
<P>
They want to build their own communities, not have them administered
by the state.  They insist that state-regulated human relations
in cyberspace will stunt, if not destroy, the growth of real society
there.
<P>
<I>&#147;This discussion is very evocative of communities in America
in the 18th century.  If you look at the communities that founded
America, many of them were fleeing a place of tyranny, and they
sought just to be unto themselves, and that was accepted originally
in America.  I think in some ways we have come full circle.&#148;</I>
<P>
Not just frontier spirit here, but a bit of <I>Allegheny Uprising</I>
too.  Cyberspace foments a rebellion against the Old Order.
<P>
<B><center>The new society is a successor society &#150; and so<br> a new
model.</B>
<P></center>
Why is this important?  This is surely the most marginal of frontier
societies.  Or is it?
<P>
What we call cyber-communities look more like encampments than
colonies.  But we tend to tie our image of community to the familial-neighborhood
icon only.  We forget that our economic intercourse is a highly
advanced network of business communities, marked by highly developed
sets of personal and group relationships.  In the US in fact,
a case can be made that the strongest personal ties that many
have are not family at all, but company and firm.  From core identity
to emotional investment, the communities of commerce define late
20th century America.
<P>
We call it The Marketplace.  And the new marketplace is moving
to the new place, cyberspace.  It is moving there because the
technologies of the ether <I>&#147;can make transaction costs
so small that we can eventually eliminate them.&#148;</I>  What
earthly market can say that?  And what market can ignore transaction
costs, when there is one that has none?
<P>
Like the ancient agora or bazaar, markets seek communities, and
communities cluster around the marketplace.  And as cyberspace
becomes a living social sphere, going to market there is not just
a response to zero transaction costs;  it is like going downtown
in the old city.  Communities actually, and increasingly, inhabit
the same space as the new marketplace.  Cyberspace begins to lose
its frontier edges, and edges into <I>Boom Town</I>.  More and
more people enter the ether and work there.  They don&#146;t just
get info dumps on their terminal;  the terminal becomes their
vehicle, their wheels into cyberspace.  So the new society gets
serious, and gets beyond the BBS, through the social network of
enterprise.
<P>
And because of business, the new society truly promises to succeed
the old.  It succeeds because it lets everything work faster,
better, and with higher confidence.  And it is open:  everything
is there to see.  Open markets have always worked on trust, and
each advance in transaction has been built on it.  Transparency
is its own enforcement.
<P>
Which means that the very nature of the cyberspace urges a ethos
of trust.  Transparency reaffirms the power of ostracism;  it
encourages virtue as no law of the land can.  What openness does
to business deadbeats, it does in a much larger sense for the
new society:  it renews the strength of custom over law, of group
rules self-defined over regulation by government authority.  And
it is fairer by far.  If <I>&#147;value is determined by the trust
that people have and can be engaged directly so as to define their
own currency even,&#148;</I> then each of us has the power to
shape our own value according to our actions.
<P>
So a new ethic in the marketplace at last comes home:  and the
far shores of a new world brings us back to the Atlantic shore
of our earliest ancestors;  back to that confidence in their values
and beliefs that is their charge to us.
<P>
<B><center>It threatens the old, and the old order seeks<br> to kill or stunt
it.</B></center>
<P>
But in this promise of progress is a problem.
<P>
<I>&#147;If markets are going to get immeasurably better, it should
be possible to return to the market many things that are handed
to government.&#148;</I>
<P>
Or, cyberspace as the main threat to the Old Order.
<P>
It took the American colonies almost two centuries to become a
threat to Britain&#146;s established order.  And it took long
war and a financial crisis to disrupt a century-long pattern of
British benign neglect of rule.
<P>
No such hope exists for cyberspace.  To the Old Order, the threat
of cyberspace is like the Industrial and the French revolutions
rolled into one.
<P>
<I>&#147;The fact that a system is chaotic and not capable of
control by old institutions, does not necessarily mean that it
is going to blow up like a bomb.&#148;</I>
<P>
Ah, but that is exactly how imperial Washington sees cyberspace.
 In its eyes it resembles a bomb in every respect:  it ticks like
a bomb, it is fused to blow in a finite period of time, and its
explosive power is enough to bring down the old house.
<P>
And the pioneers know it:
<P>
<I>&#147;When we start using phrases like </I>Government as the
Engine of Progress<I>, then we are deep into machine think and
machine language.&#148; ... &#147;The old machine model came out
with a perfect Hoover blueprint for everything.  Everything has
to be under control. Everything has to be in balance.  All the
pieces have to fit together.  But the machine can&#146;t evolve
or change.  And I think what we are engaged in now is the disassembly
of that super bureaucratic apparatus.&#148;</I>
<P>
or,
<P>
<I>&#147;We should be examining very critically just which freedoms
really need government to be protected&#148; ... &#147;Before
we hand back to government or say to government, oh yes, you get
to protect all our freedoms, we should ask critically just which
ones we can protect for ourselves ...&#148;</I>
<P>
All we have to do is listen to our own words.
<P>
So &#147;telecom&#148; legislation brought forward by the <I>ancien
regime</I> is offered as public reform or public protection, but
it is intended to freeze evolution.  It would be like Charles
II forbidding all ship departures from Bristol to British North
America.  Of course, that would have been a form of royal self-mutilation.
 It was beyond the 17th century imagination.
<P>
But not beyond of the mind of the late 20th century imperial bureaucrat:
<P>
<I>&#147;We are in a world with ever-increasing regulatory tentacles
reaching throughout the system, and even now beginning to invade
the information economy itself and strangle it  ...&#148;</I>
<P>
or,
<P>
<I>&#147;What we need is for telephone companies with their tremendous
fiber capacity to link to the broad band connections to homes
that cable companies now possess to create a broad band infrastructure
for the Internet.  But because regulators prohibit this natural
evolution ... capital is fleeing from the Internet ... to Hollywood.&#148;</I>
<P>
The irony is that forcing new world builders to compete over &#147;content&#148;
drives telecom back to the social universe of couch potato-TV;
 back to the stupefying, one-way feed box of industrial information
... back to the vision of George Orwell.
<P>
Back to the cultural compass of the 1950s?  Back to the future?
<P>
<B><center>We need to protect the new from the old, <br>while it is still
vulnerable.</center></B>
<P>
No regime has ever stopped relentless change.  Revolutions happen;
 the Soviet <I>nomenclatura</I> had not enough T-72s to stop theirs,
and our Imperial City has not enough Clipper Chips or Senators
Exxon to starve out the brash settlements on the Net.  But they
can slow it down, divert its course for awhile, give us all grief.
<P>
But what we have made in cyberspace is revolution&#146;s start.
 We don&#146;t have to worry about what it will do:  we know full
well what it will do.  What we must do is fight like hell to give
this juggernaut &#150; just like yesterday&#146;s locomotive of
progress &#150; its History-breaking head of steam.
<P>
<I>&#147;I am convinced that federal level government is an industrial
era artifact that arose to protect the interests of large industrial
institutions and will go away with them.&#148;</I>

<P><p><P>
 It's still trendy among liberals to link homelessness with supposed
government cuts in social services.  Nattering about Newt in the
mid-90s has replaced the roaring about Reaganism that characterized
the early-80s, but the message is the same:  Budget dips sink
ships.  The truth is different:  Many of the lives sinking in
recent years had holes cut into their hulls 25 years ago, during
liberalism's golden age.
<P>
 Take as a case study the story of Rudy Jones, 45.  He grew up
in a middle class household in the District and as a teenager
reacted, 60s-style, to school &quot;regimentation.&quot; He became
a voracious reader of political thrillers and worked for Hubert
Humphrey's campaign in 1968.  Then he went to college, where drugs
were more important than studies, and learned about LSD, speed
and surrealistic painting.
<P>
 After college Mr. Jones moved to Los Angeles and &quot;tried
to get into the film business.  That's where I really got into
some fast circles.  I was doing a lot of powdered cocaine out
there.&quot;  The infantilized gratification-seeking that characterized
late-sixties politics and culture stayed with him as he moved
back to Washington and worked at a television station as a production
technician and then as film and tape editor.  
<P>
 By 1984, Cal Ripken, Jr. thirty miles to the north had already
begun his streak of showing up for work day after day, but it
was hard for a child of the sixties to be an iron man.  A stripper
in a strip-tease joint in 1984 introduced Jones to crack cocaine,
which he had heard of before as a drug that led middle class people
to &quot;sell their houses and break up their lives.&quot;  He
had scoffed at such reports, but when he took his first hit &quot;the
bells were going off in the center of my brain.&quot;
<P>
 Jones had learned during the sixties to satisfy his impulses,
and he spent the mid-80s turning theory into practice.  More cocaine,
more disintegration in his life: &quot;It was like a slow motion
train wreck.  A big long pile up.&quot;  Unable to work consistently
because of his drug use, Jones left his job in 1988 and began
a series of freelance assignments that would give him the money
for crack without the obligation of regular labor.  
<P>
 The culmination came in September, 1994, when he received a check
for $1500 from a public television station: &quot;I just went
nuts. Didn't sleep or eat for four days in a row, doing crack
all the time.  That's when I realized I needed to do something
drastic.&quot;   Drastic for Jones was entering a live-in, anti-addiction
program at the Gospel Mission at 810 Fifth St., N.W.
<P>
   Ironically, it was sixties reasoning -- don't think about right
and wrong, just show me where I can get a buzz -- that led him
into a program built on right and wrong:  Jones based his decision
to enter the Gospel Mission not on faith in Christ, but on research
showing that religious anti-addiction programs are more successful
than others:  &quot;I wanted to get results, I didn't care how.&quot;
 
<P>
 Pragmatism changed to awe as Jones went through the Gospel Mission's
Bible studies and counseling programs, however. The transformation,
he says, began when he stopped thinking of God as &quot;a bunch
of physics laws&quot; and started to see Him as &quot;a personal
entity that man could relate to.&quot;  Suddenly he could pray,
for he knew that God was listening.  Suddenly there was purpose
that went outside self-pleasing, for God was watching.  Suddenly
there was power to change, because God was helping.
<P>
 After five months Jones felt &quot;completely changed.&quot;
 When I interviewed him in February, 1995, he spoke of no longer
living for each day's pleasures, as he had done since the 1960s,
but dying to self -- seeing God rather than man as the center
of things. 
<P>
 
<P>
 Complete changes sometimes short-circuit; time heals all wounds
and also tests all spiritual swoons.  I've checked on Rudy Jones:
 He has stayed clean this year and was judged ready to move out
of the Gospel Mission in order to live with and care for his mother,
who is now in her 80s and in need of help.  He's working in telecommunications
and volunteering twice a week to teach English and writing to
newcomers at the Mission.   Stuck in the sixties for three decades,
he has finally grown up.  And its time that the apologists for
infantilism did so also.

The Clinton Administration has portrayed its direct lending program for college students as essential to the educational future of young Americans. Nothing could be further from the truth. The direct government lending program is bad for taxpayers, bad for students, and bad for schools. Later this week, the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee and the House Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee will consider the statutory changes necessary to achieve the spending targets for the 1996 federal education budget. They could expand, cap, or eliminate the Clinton direct lending program. The best choice for taxpayers, students, and schools would be to end it.
<p>

<b>STUDENT LOAN PROGRAMS</b>
<p>
The primary source of student financial aid in America is federally guaranteed student loans. Since it was created in 1965, this program, now known as the Federal Family Education Loan Program (FFEL), has funded 74 million student loans worth over $180 billion.1  More than six million loans totaling nearly $22 billion were disbursed in FY 1994 alone.2  Private lenders provide the capital for the loans, and private and state guarantor agencies process them. The federal government subsidizes the interest rate, guarantees the loans in cases of default, and exercises regulatory authority over the program. This relationship, while by no means perfect, has worked relatively well in providing loans to millions of American college and university students.3<p>In 1993, the Clinton Administration proposed replacing this program with direct lending by the federal government, extending a limited pilot program approved in the 1992 Higher Education Act. The Administration claimed this would be more efficient. While schools would administer the program, the federal government would borrow the money necessary to provide capital for the loans and would service and collect the loans itself. This plan would radically change the federal government's three-decade involvement in college lending programs by effecting what Senator Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS) called "a total federal takeover of a successful public-private sector partnership."4<p>Congress initially rejected a full direct lending program, but approved a trial phase-in over at least five years:  5 percent of loan volume in 1994-1995, 40 percent in 1995-1996, 50 percent or more in 1996-1998, and 60 percent or more in 1998-1999. The U.S. Department of Education in July 1994 began making direct loans to 104 schools, representing 5 percent of the loan volume. In a sign that schools are hesitating to participate, the 1995-1996 loan volume will end up at around 28.7 percent -- far short of the 40 percent target.5  The Administration hopes to accelerate the program to reach 100 pe
rcent participation in 1997-1998, and is willing to require colleges and universities -- including those that object to the program -- to participate.6<p><b>BAD ECONOMICS</b><p>Much of the debate over direct loans turns on the question of cost:  Replacing guaranteed loans with direct lending is supposed to save taxpayers billions of dollars. The FY 1996 Clinton budget claims $4.1 billion in savings over the 1996-2000 period if the direct loan program is fully implemented.7  Recent cost estimates tell a very different story.<p><b>Eliminating the direct loan program saves money.</b> Prior to 1990, the long-term financing and administrative costs of all student loans were ignored in budget scoring, and direct loan capital outlays were considered current year expenditures. This problem was corrected with the Credit Reform Act of 1990, which required calculation of these long-term costs for guaranteed loans but not for direct loans. When the direct loan program was enacted in 1993, the Congressional Budget Office initially estimated the program could save $4.3 billion over five years.8  This estimate ignored the long-term costs of direct loans in accordance with the Credit Reform Act. The 1996 Budget Resolution, however, amended the Credit Reform Act to account for the complicated long-term administrative costs of the direct loan program. The revised report of the Congressional Budget Office, released in July and based on these changes in official budget scoring, projects that a fully implemented direct loan program would save just $115 million over the next seven years. Indeed, according to the CBO, eliminating the direct loan program and maintaining the guaranteed program would save $1.5 billion in budget outlays over the next seven years.9<p><b>The direct loan program adds considerably to the national debt.</b> The vast bulk of capital for student loans today is provided by private sources. But under the Clinton plan, the federal government would borrow the money necessary to provide capital for the loan
s. This would require the federal government to borrow an additional $20 billion-$25 billion each year to provide enough capital for the program. According the Representative Ernest Istook (R-OK) in congressional testimony last spring, a complete shift to direct loans could add $348 billion to the national debt by the year 2014.10  Two independent analyses in 1993, conducted by leading accounting firms, argued that such amounts of government borrowing could increase interest rates on the public debt. One noted that this would "wipe out the saving claimed for direct lending" and warned lawmakers that they "may be on the verge of making a serious public policy mistake" if they shifted to direct lending.11<p>Furthermore, the direct loan program is fiscally irresponsible. A key feature of the Clinton direct loan program is the "income contingent repayment plan" for students. The goal of this plan is to reduce the debt repayment burden on graduates struggling with repayment, thereby also reducing the rate of loan defaults. Instead of a regular monthly installment, repayment is contingent on future income. Students choosing this option, however, could well end up increasing their personal debt by stretching out their repayment period and actually increasing the principal on the loan. Nor will this help the default problem. According to the Congressional Research Service, "direct lending is largely irrelevant as a means of reducing [default] costs" and "may well increase default costs."12  If borrowers stretch out their repayments to 25 years, as encouraged by the income contingent repayment plan, the accumulated debt will simply be forgiven. Loan defaults would be permitted and assumed by the government.<p><b>BAD EDUCATION POLICY</b>
<p>
Direct lending centralizes control of student loans within the U.S. Department of Education. The Department is hiring 600 new employees to administer the program and anticipates 20,000 contract employees by the time the program is fully operational. The government already is funding this expansion with an unencumbered $2.5 billion authorization. This not only builds a new government bureaucracy, but also creates the potential for vast inefficiencies and unconstrained program costs. 
<p>
The Department of Education is notoriously disorganized and mismanaged. It has proven that it cannot manage the existing student aid program,13 and already is having problems dealing with the current small-scale direct lending program. Among other things, students are experiencing delays and complicated paperwork.14  In 1994 the Department of Education gave out $700 million in direct loans but was unable to account for some $100 million.15  The Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance, created by Congress as an independent advisory body on student aid, concludes in a recent study that the direct loan program is "potentially exposed to multiple loans, overawards, loans to ineligible students, and excessive cash drawdowns" and, in general, cannot "ensure program integrity."16 <p>The Administration has proposed turning to another bureaucracy to solve the problem of loan collection:  the Internal Revenue Service. A joint study by the Education and Treasury Departments, however, concludes that "it is not feasible to expand the participation of the IRS in the collection of student loans."  IRS involvement in loan collection would "strain IRS resources, interfere with its primary mission, and decrease higher dollar tax collections, without improving student loan program administration or customer service."17  Without the IRS, however, the burden falls back on the Department of Education.<p>There are precedents for failure with direct loans. In the early 1970s, Congress experimented with direct loans through the Federally Insured Student Loan (FISL) program. It was poorly managed, and because the government was ineffective at collecting the loans, default rates soared above previous levels. It was phased out in 1976. Largely because of this failure, there emerged the current decentralized system that relies on private lenders and guarantors.
<p>
The direct loan program also is bad for academic freedom. Three quarters of all available college financial aid comes from the federal government.18  If the government takes over the loan program, colleges and universities will become dependent on a single lender to support their students. Its power to control loan revenue, together with its regulatory authority and enforcement power, will give the government vast influence over post-secondary education. The very possibility that the federal government might use this new authority to force curriculum changes or mandate racial preferences should breed caution. This is no farfetched theory; it is the very question settled in favor of the government in the 1984 Supreme Court case of <i>Grove City College v. Bell</i>.19  There currently are efforts to centralize further the college accreditation process (which allows a college's students to be eligible for financial aid in the first place) as a way of enforcing nationwide multicultural education standards.20  One can only imagine the temptations presented to some education reformers if the power of accreditation is combined with government control over student loan money. If recent history is any guide, further government intrusion can only harm college and university education.21 <p><b>CONCLUSION</b><p>The existing guaranteed loan program is not perfect. Taxpayers bear all the risk, and schools, students, and lenders should bear greater responsibility. The system must be based on genuine risk sharing that minimizes government costs without destabilizing the current loan program. At the same time, recent improvements in the program should not be overlooked. The loan application process has become simpler in recent years, and the default rate has declined significantly. All of these improvements would be even greater if some of the streamlining ideas in the direct lending program were applied to the guaranteed loan program.
<p>
The solution is not to nationalize the multi-billion-dollar student loan program. That would mean new costs and bureaucracy. Moreover, Americans believe strongly that student loans should continue to be provided through private financial institutions, not the federal government.22 <p>Nor is the solution to maintain the program at some arbitrary level. This only postpones the final program decision, validates the creation of a new education bureaucracy, and delays the reforms needed to strengthen and improve funding prospects for America's educational future.23 <p>The only prudent and fiscally responsible answer is to eliminate the program.<p><b>Endnotes:</b><p><ol><li>For a review of the loan programs and ways to reform them, see Scott A.

<p>
<img alt="Picture of David Keene" src="keentest.gif"><br>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE="3" WIDTH"="30%"><P>
Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee.  Let me begin by thanking you for the opportunity to testify before you this morning.
<P>
My name is <A HREF="/conservative/kbio.html">David Keene</a> and I am Chairman of the American Conservative Union.  The ACU has for more than 30 years served as the grass-roots lobby for the conservative movement.  Our nearly one million members have been interested in and involved in the debate over whether the Legal Service Corporation can be reformed or whether it should be eliminated as a delivery vehicle for legal services to disadvantaged Americans since the mid-seventies and feel very strongly that the entrenched interests in control of the corporation make it very unlikely that any meaningful reform is even possible.
<P>
Sometimes a program that has gone off the tracks becomes so entrenched and resistant to reform that it has to be eliminated.  The LSC is such a program.  It will do no good to cut off a few branches . . . you must go to the root problem, bite the bullet . . . and start over.
<P>
The Legal Services Corporation was, as you know, established in 1974 to take over the programs then housed within the Office of Legal Services in the Office of Economic Opportunity or OEO.
<P>
You will hear various versions of just why the LSC was established, but as you consider the question of extending its funding, I would urge you to consider that the Nixon Administration had been urged to establish such a quasi-governmental corporation by the Ash Commission in 1971 as "a first step toward reprivatization of what has traditionally been a function of the private sector."
<P>
The LSC has, in fact, developed into something quite different employing via grants and contract thousands of attorneys who have become dependent upon government largesse both for their income and as a means of allowing them the freedom to pursue an agenda that has very little to do with providing individual legal services to those who cannot otherwise afford to go to a lawyer.
<P>
It must be admitted that most of those who came to dominate the new corporation as well as a sizable number of those who fought first to establish it and later to defend it have no desire at all to "reprivatize" the provision of legal services within our society.  Rather, they sought a permanent home for their activities with a guaranteed source of funding free of even the minimal oversight they had faced at OEO.
<P>
And . . . as history has shown . . . the interests that quickly came to dominate the new corporation have a far, far different view of its role in our society than did most of those who voted to establish it.
<P>
Many in Congress who voted in 1974 to establish the LSC did so in the belief that through the corporation they would be giving individual Americans without the wherewithal to afford private lawyers access to the legal system that they might otherwise be denied.  They envisioned a small army of idealistic men and women utilizing LSC grants to help poor families fight unfair evictions or avoid consumer rip-offs.
<P>
Since 1974, however, the LSC has spent millions of dollars on quasi-legal political activity designed to "organize" and "empower" the poor as a group or class . . . money that might better have been used to serve individual clients.  The mission as those running
LSC has seen it is to transform American society by changing laws and governmental policies affecting what they tend to see as their constituencies.
<P>

Partisan and ideological disputes between Congress and the White House have allowed the LSC more than independence they made it unaccountable to anyone.  And this has allowed the interests that came to dominate it to take total and complete control . . . . A case in which the inhabitants were truly given control of the asylum.
<P>
There are no doubt good men and women working within the LSC framework who do see their mission as the members of Congress who voted to establish the program saw it.  I have no doubt that these men and women are out there serving the legitimate needs of individual clients.
<P>
We can applaud the work of these people while recognizing that the LSC has gone off the tracks in pursuing an additional mission that Congress has an obligation to halt.  The simple fact is that the LSC's major impact has not been in serving these clients, but in funding a network of activists dedicated not to helping clients function better within the framework of our society, but to changing that society.
<P>
The question is not whether the policy goals LSC grantees have sought are good or bad . . . or how much time they spend pursuing it, but whether Congress ought to be funding an effort to undermine the authority of the states and to influence public policy at all levels.
<P>
Private citizens have every right. . . indeed they may often have a moral obligation . . . to organize and work for policy changes that they hope will lead to the kind of society in which they want to live . . . and in which they want to raise their children and grandchildren.
<P>
But that is far, far different from saying that they have a right to tax money to finance such activities.
<P>
The funding of the LSC has amounted to little more that the channeling of tax money to men and women with an ideological, political agenda and allowed them to use that money to pursue that agenda.
<P>
Let's be clear.  Congress has no business funding such activities.
<P>
Senator Hollings said earlier this morning that the proper way to achieve such change is not through the course, but through the Congress . . . and he is dead right.
<P>
There is a legitimate question as to whether Congress should be funding even the provision of individual legal services . . . those services which the Ash Commission so correctly described as traditionally a function of the private sector.
<P>
The question of whether the private sector can accomplish this task will be debated in and out of Congress . . . and should be.
<P>
But that debate . . . however it is resolved . . . should not influence your vote on the continuation of the LSC.  As constituted with its network of grantees, contractors, alumni and friends the LSC cannot be reformed or limited to these arguably legitimate functions.
<P>
Instead, you must abolish it . . . reduce its funding to zero, send those who have perverted its original purpose and misused the tax money you have provided them packing . . . and start over.
<P>
If this Congress truly believes that tax monies should be used to provide legal assistance to those without  the funds needed to gain access to the civil justice system, you should design a system that will accomplish this goal, but don't think for a minute that the Legal Services Corporation can or will help you in the effort.
<P>
It's something you are going to have to do on your own.
<P>
Thank you.

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">D</FONT></B>uring the coming year, Americans will begin a serious debate over the meaning and value of affirmative action. Among the early signs:
	<P>	A proposed ballot initiative in California aims to amend the state constitution to 
prohibit preferential treatment in public policy based on race, sex, ethnicity, or national 
origin.</P>
<P>	In Georgia, the state legislature considers a bill to end preferences for women and 
minorities in landing county contracts.</P>
<P>	Senator and presidential hopeful Phil Gramm (R-TX) promises that, if elected, he 
will end major set-aside programs on his first day in office.</P>
<P>	President Clinton orders an "intense, urgent review" of all aspects of government 
affirmative-action policy. Veteran Democratic strategist Susan Estrich says that as far as 
affirmative action is concerned, "now is truly the time to move on to some other 
approach."</P>
<P>	The Supreme Court may oblige her. In agreeing to hear Adarand v. Pena, the 
Court threatens to reform, restrict, or undo federal set-asides for minority-owned 
businesses. Policy Review asked several black businessmen to describe the impact of 
race-based government contracting on entrepreneurship, and to offer their own insights 
into establishing successful businesses in an increasingly competitive market. Here are 
their stories:

<H3>Ward Connerly</H3>
<P>	Of all the terms used to describe America, none is more descriptive (and it is my 
favorite) than "the land of opportunity." Opportunity, the chance to advance in life, is the 
centerpiece of our value system. It is this concept that separates us from the rest of the 
world. For opportunity to have meaning, there must be entrepreneurs, people who are 
willing to take chances in order to succeed. True entrepreneurs are created not by 
government, but by God, and their natural talents are stimulated by the marketplace.</P>
<P>	In recent years, our nation has begun to debate the effects and consequences of 
"affirmative action." Affirmative action comes in many forms; some are acceptable, even 
desirable, such as advertising the availability of contract opportunities in minority 
communities, and adopting strong measures to ensure that racial and gender 
discrimination have no place in our society.</P>
<P>	Other forms of affirmative action, however, are very damaging to the nation and 
to those whom such programs and practices are designed to benefit. One of the most 
odious forms of affirmative action is the concept of awarding contracts on the basis of 
racial, ethnic, or gender preferences. There are many variations on this theme, but the 
approach taken in California is fairly representative and instructive.</P>
<P>	Several years ago, the California state legislature passed a law requiring every 
state agency to award 15 percent of all contracts to firms owned by minority business 
enterprises (MBEs), 5 percent to firms owned by women-owned business enterprises 
(WBEs), and 3 percent to firms owned by disabled veterans (DVBEs). Minorities are 
defined as "socially and economically disadvantaged" groups and include blacks, 
Hispanics, Asians, and Native Americans.</P>
<P>	What are the effects of this policy?</P>
<P>	First, the prospect of getting government contracts, as a result of belonging to a 
protected group, is sometimes a false inducement for people to go into business without 
being adequately prepared to be in business. They often are undercapitalized and lack the 
business acumen to remain in business without government contracts. This is not itself a 
sin, but these businesses tend to become an extension of the government agencies 
themselves. Consequently, the agencies often create contract opportunities to sustain 
these businesses rather than acting to meet their needs or those of the taxpayers.
<P>	Second, the costs and headaches associated with administering the MBE and 
WBE programs are significant. A bureaucracy of MBE/WBE coordinators has been 
established in virtually every department of California's state government. This 
obviously increases the cost of government and creates enormous inefficiencies for 
companies that do business with the state. There is great inconsistency across 
departments, and many officials confess that their programs cost more because of these 
set-aside requirements.</P>
<P>	Third, these practices are marginalizing better-established businesses because they 
are forced to share their contracts with MBE/WBE partners. Few businesses can sacrifice 
23 percent from a contract and still make a profit. I hear the argument that 23 percent is 
not being taken off the top, but rather the total pie is merely being sliced differently. 
Sometimes that is true. Our firm, however, is usually able to carry out most portions of 
our contracts. Yet we must often create a role for those whom we are required to include. 
This generally means subcontracting for tasks that we could perform ourselves at lower 
cost. Whenever we take on a state contract, we lose profit, and our private-sector clients 
bear the burden of our higher prices.</P>
<P>	After 22 years in business, I know that government procurement of goods and 
services is less costly when the specifications are clear and private contractors are able to 
fit these requirements into their methods of doing business. Whenever contractors have to 
customize their methods of delivering products, such as aligning themselves with new 
partners, the cost on a per unit basis of doing business inevitably rises.</P>
<P>	Fourth, the quality of the work sometimes suffers. When you are forced into a 
shotgun relationship with firms with whom you do not regularly do business, it is 
inescapable that you lose some management control over the project.</P>
<P>	Fifth, the policy invites deception. For example, there is evidence that some 
women or minorities listed as "owners" exercise no control over the day-to-day 
operations of their businesses. In some instances, the so-called owner rarely sets foot on 
the premises. How is the goal of equality advanced when, say, a man who has owned a 
construction business for decades suddenly switches ownership to his wife?</P>
<P>	Finally, these set-aside programs are blatantly unfair. Consider my own business. 
I own 50 percent of the stock issued by my company. My wife owns the other 50 percent. 
Technically, neither of us "controls" the business, and we qualify for neither MBE nor 
WBE preferences.</P>
<P>	We have chosen not to change the ownership of our business merely to qualify for 
preferences based on my race or her gender. But why should we operate at a competitive 
disadvantage just because we prefer to be considered on the merits of our work? How 
does society benefit when a business established 22 years ago, by individuals who were 
willing to risk their economic futures, is disfavored in order to lure others to go into 
business?</P>
<P>	Minority set-aside programs are creating all kinds of dysfunction in the 
marketplace, they are unfair, and they are based on the false proposition that government 
should be creating business opportunities for women and minorities. What government 
should be doing is ensuring, through advertising and other forms of outreach, that 
opportunities are equally available, and then allowing the marketplace to produce the 
lowest legitimate bids for the goods and services that the government seeks to procure.</P>

<B>WARD CONNERLY <I>is president of Connerly and Associates, Inc., a Sacramento-based 
consulting firm. He serves on the University of California Board of Regents and recently 
testified in favor of the California Civil Rights Initiative.</I></B>

<H3>Daniel Colimon</H3>
<P>	I operate perhaps the largest black-owned litigation-support firm in California. 
We have been in business for 14 years, and our clients include at least 200 law firms from 
Santa Barbara to San Diego. We have never sought a government contract as a minority 
firm, and federal set-asides for awarding contracts to minority-owned businesses anger 
me to no end.</P>
<P>	After our firm did some work for the legal department of a state utility, one of its 
officials told me that if we became a certified minority enterprise, they would make us 
their primary vendor. There was no discussion of the quality of our work--none 
whatsoever. </P>
<P>	They merely needed to rack up points with the state's Public Utility Commission, 
which requires all state agencies to do at least 15 percent of their business with minority-
owned companies.</P>
<P>	I said no. Commission officials called me every other week for two and a half 
months. They warned that if we continued to refuse, they would simply opt for another 
vendor. They did, and I have since lost 80 percent of their business.</P>
<P>	It is time for America to acknowledge that affirmative action doesn't work. There 
are fatal flaws in set-aside programs, which, despite all of the good intentions, hope, and 
government intervention, have produced very few positive changes. If anything, the white 
"backlash" to affirmative action has perpetuated the polarization of America's various 
ethnic groups.</P>
<P>	If affirmative action was to be the vehicle by which we travel the road to racial 
equality, somewhere along the way we lost first the keys and then the map. If affirmative 
action was to redress past discrimination against African Americans and other racial 
minorities, it has failed miserably:</P>
<UL><LI>  White males dominate the social, political, and business landscape as never before.<BR>
<LI>  Racial minorities are still largely absent from the private sector's management or 
executive boardrooms.<BR>
<LI>  Worst of all, affirmative-action programs have established an extremely damaging 
stereotype that places African Americans and other racial minorities in a very precarious 
position. We are perceived as a group of people who--regardless of how hard we work, 
how educated we become, or what we achieve--would not be where we are without the 
preferential treatment afforded by affirmative-action programs.</UL>
<P>	Throughout my life, I have been taught that the best place to look for help is in the 
mirror. I grew up poor and  black and  in a single-parent household. I graduated from a 
predominantly white university. I have worked since the age of 12. I founded an 
extremely successful litigation-support firm that employs people of all races.</P>
<P>	Although I have suffered with the burden of being a businessman who happens to 
be black, never have I been given nor have I expected preferential treatment simply 
because I am black. I defy anyone to put an asterisk next to any of my accomplishments. I 
have always demanded that I receive respect, not by virtue of what I am, but of who I am. 
Conversely, I have always accorded the same treatment to all I have encountered, 
regardless of race, creed, or national origin.</P>
<P>	My personal experiences with affirmative-action programs, in the business 
community and outside it, have all been negative. It is not popular to be black and 
opposed to affirmative action. When discussing this with other blacks, I've been told that 
I have sold out to the white agenda. On the contrary, I argue that we don't need any 
affirmative-action programs precisely because I believe so strongly in my capabilities and 
those of all people of all races.</P>
<P>	Such programs are not the solution to America's race problem. Truly 
"affirmative" action should take the form of equal-quality education, which will help lead 
to equal political access and equal economic opportunity. Additionally, it is imperative 
that we acknowledge the existence of institutional racial discrimination. Rather than 
disavowing responsibility for it or wasting 25 years on programs that have not worked, 
we should aggressively ferret out those who practice clear discrimination and prosecute 
them. </P>
<P>	Only then will we truly be able to say that we have equal opportunity. The 
measure of this will be a society where people can achieve success regardless of race,  
where people "will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their 
character."</P>

<B>DANIEL COLIMON <I>is the chief executive officer of Law-in-Motion, Inc., a Los Angeles-
based litigation-support firm.</I></B>

<H3>Herman Cain</H3>
<P>	When Pillsbury Co. hired me as president of Godfather's Pizza, one of its failing 
subsidiaries, we  couldn't count on a government contract to revive the chain. Not only 
did we want to rescue the chain from debt and looming bankruptcy; we wanted to have 
the industry's highest average sales per unit and the highest average profitability per unit. 
You don't get that without a commitment to quality and an acute sensitivity to your 
market.</P>
<P>	When Ronald Gartlan and I later led a team of other managers to buy Godfather's 
Pizza, we didn't use a set-aside program. We had to fight and defend and sell the banks 
on our merit as investors. Our success or failure was based on our own raw business 
ability.</P>
<P>	If there were no federal programs to assist minority business owners, the 1 percent 
of businesses owned by the black community would probably be zero. But federal set-
asides are a double-edged sword: Any time you have a guaranteed participation level, you 
may not have the same incentives or the same motivation to perform as in a situation that 
is driven by performance. On the other hand, without set-asides, many minorities 
candidates for contracts, jobs, or services would not even be considered for inclusion.</P>
<P>	Remember, you need capital to start a business. The lack of access to capital is the 
number one reason for the tiny percentage of black-owned businesses. Set-asides do not 
address the capital issue as it relates to starting, maintaining, and running a business.</P>
<P>	One of the most important aspects of being successful is relationship-building. 
The vendor and the customer have to develop a relationship based on trust and 
performance. But you can't legislate relationships; set-aside programs won't build 
relationships between minority businesses and their customers.</P>
<P>	As a businessman and as a black American, I know there still exists institutional 
racism, which tends to exclude people from consideration. As a result, I've practiced 
several principles to help me achieve my goals:</P>
<UL><LI>  Because I am a black American, I've had to perform better than my white counterparts. 
This is a personal standard that I've set for myself: I've got to perform a little better in 
order to get the same opportunity. I can't just be as good; I've got to be better. It should 
not be this way, but it is.<BR>
<LI>  When I come across those barriers, such as racial bias, I have to let my performance be 
my barrier buster. That's just the price you pay for success.<BR>
<LI>  I have to maintain focus and be tenacious in achieving my objectives.</UL>
<P>	I have been very successful in corporate America because I have refused to allow 
any of the normal obstacles--and there have been many--to stop me. Part of my success 
is linked to getting an opportunity, but another part is taking advantage of the opportunity 
by staying focused. That is something you can't legislate or put in a program.</P>
<P>	When I came to Godfather's, I sought the views of the management, the 
operations people, and the franchises on how we got into the mess we were in and how 
we could get out. By focusing on our strengths and on the market niches where we could 
win, we embarked on a path to recovery. In just over a year--and against intense 
competition--store sales increased about 10 percent, with some restaurants running as 
high as 25 percent. More important than the numbers, however, is the fact that over the 
last several years we have built a foundation for sustained profitability.</P>
<P>	I'm a firm believer that we are put on this earth to make a difference. I happen to 
have been blessed in that I have achieved some business success. But what's truly 
important to me is that I'm able to use the position, compensation, and incentives that go 
along with business success to help make a difference in other people's lives.</P>
<BR>
<B>HERMAN CAIN <I>is the president and chief executive officer of Godfather's Pizza, with 
more than 525 restaurants nationwide. He is the current president of the National 
Restaurant Association.</B></I>

<h2>Affirmative Effort Op-Ed</h2>
<b>By Jack Kemp</b>
</center>
<hr>
<p>	
The scene is Washington D.C.:  a Republican President, new to the White House, defiantly throwing down the gauntlet to a Republican Congress, saying he will veto any bill that proposes to do more for "black Americans" than for "whites".
<p>
This is not some fast-forward vision of 1997, and the first days of a new Republican White House.  No, it's a flashback to 1866.  The agency to be vetoed was The Freedman's Bureau, established in President Lincoln's administration to "affirmatively" assist the recently emancipated African Americans.  The President -- Andrew Johnson, Mr. Lincoln's successor,  worried that any "affirmative action" would hurt the white population by specifically helping "negroes".
<p>
I offer this page out of history not to prove once again that, politically, there is not much new under the sun, but to illustrate that the issues of race and equality are woven into the very essence of our American experience.  While our present-day passions on the subject of affirmative action open old wounds -- they summon us to moral leadership of Lincolnesque proportions.
<p>
Thus far, the summons goes unanswered by both liberals and conservatives alike.  The unreconstructed liberal notion of endless racial reparations and race-based preferences is doubly guilty:  wrong in principle, and ruinous in practice.  President Clinton's much-vaunted affirmative action review produced more of a bumper sticker than a policy; Clinton's focus-group-fashioned "mend it, not end it" slogan makes a far better rhyme than reason.  The same, however, is true of the new affirmative action "abolitionists'" position which heralds equality but seldom addresses the way to truly give all people an equal footing.  Critics are right in asserting that "Affirmative Action" quotas have contributed to the poisoning of race relations in this country:  But critics must offer much more than just opposition and reproach.  We know what they are against, but what instead are they for?  
<p>
"A color-blind society," comes their response.  Of course, the goal of equal opportunity is paramount and a worthy destiny to seek -- but to say that we have arrived at that goal is simply not true.  My friends on the Right call for a color blind society and then quote Martin Luther King's inspirational "I have a dream" speech in which he imagined a nation in which every American would be judged not on the color of his or her skin, but on the "content of his character."  But all too often they totally neglect to quote the end of his speech when he describes the painful plight of minority America:  "The Negro," Dr. King said, "lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity."
<p>
Much has changed in the thirty years since King stood on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.  Minority enterprises have begun to gain a foothold, although there are far too few of them.  But can any one venture to the crumbling brick and mortar of Cabrini Green Public Housing, or the fear-ridden projects of Bed-Stuy or the streets lined with the unemployed in South Central L.A. or East St. Louis, and believe that what he sees there today would pass as progress since Dr. King's day?
<p>
This is not to negate the gains made by so many in the black and minority communities, but for large numbers the situation has not only not improved in thirty years, it has grown dramatically worse -- with a welfare system that entraps rather than empowers and punishes work and marriage and prevents access to capital, credit, and property.  Reality requires that we admit two things-- difficult admissions for both liberals and conservatives:  First, that a race conscious policy of quotas and rigid preferences has helped make matters worse.  But second, and more importantly, the Good Shepherd reminds all of us that our work is not done and as we think about moving into the twenty-first century, we must not leave anyone behind.
<p>
Sound policy begins with strong principles.  Affirmative action based on quotas is wrong  -- wrong because it is antithetical to the genius of the American idea:  individual liberty.  Counting by race in order to remedy past wrongs or rewarding special groups by taking from others perpetuates and even deepens the divisions between us, but race-based politics is even more wrong and must be repudiated by men and women of civility and compassion.  	
<p>
Instead, like the "radical Republicans" of Lincoln's day, who overrode President Johnson's veto on The Freedman's Bureau, we would honor the past by creating a future more in keeping with our revolutionary founding ideals of equality.  In this way, the eventual ending of affirmative action is only a beginning -- the political predicate of a new promise of outreach in the name of greater opportunity for access to capital, credit, prosperity, jobs, and educational choice for all.
<p>
The time has definitely come for a new approach, an "affirmative action" based not just on gender or race or ethnicity, but ultimately based on need.  "Affirmative", because government authority must be employed to remove the obstacles to upward mobility and human advancement.  "Action", because democratic societies must act positively and make real equality of opportunity -- without promising the equality of reward.
<p>
Affirming opportunity in America begins with education.  America's schools, particularly our urban public schools, are depriving minority and low-income children of the education that may be their passport out of poverty.  Even the poorest parent must have the option more affluent families enjoy:  the right to send their children to the school of their choice.  Affirmative effort means ending the educational monopoly that makes poor public school students into pawns of the educational bureaucracy.  And we should be paving the way to a voucher and magnet school system of public and private school choice.
<p>
Opportunity means an entryway into the job market.  That means removing barriers for job creation and entrepreneurship and expanding access to capital and credit.  According to the Wall Street Journal, from 1982 to 1987, the number of black owned firms increased by nearly 38%, about triple the overall business growth rate during that period.  Hispanic-owned businesses soared by 81%.  Women owned firms expanded by 57% and their sales nearly tripled.  Even so, of the 14 million small businesses in existence across the U.S. today, less than two percent are Black-owned.  And of 27 to 28 trillion dollars of capital in the U.S., less than one percent is in Black ownership.  Affirmative effort would take aim at expanding capital and credit as the life-blood of business formation and job creation -- including an aggressive effort to end the red-lining of our inner cities and a radical redesign of our tax code to remove barriers to broader ownership of capital, savings, and credit.
<p>
Opportunity means the ability to accumulate property.  Affirmative effort would mean an end to every federal program that penalizes the poor for  managing to save and accumulate their own assets.  An AFDC mother's thrift and foresight in putting money away for a child's future should not be penalized by the government welfare system as fraud -- as is currently the case.
<p>
Finally, real opportunity for racial and ethnic reconciliation requires an expanding economy -- one that invites the effort and enterprise of all Americans, including minorities and women.  A real pro-growth policy must include policies ranging from enterprise zones in our cities to a commitment to lowering barriers to global trade.  It should also offer relief from red tape, regulation and freedom from punitive tax policies.  Each is part of an affirmative action that can "move America forward without leaving anyone behind."
<p>
Now that we have opened a somewhat hysterical dialogue on affirmative action, we can never go back --  we can only go forward.  Our challenge is to put aside the past -- abandon the endless round of recrimination and a politics that feeds on division, exclusion, anger and envy -- and reaffirm, like Lincoln at his moment of maximum crisis, a vision of the "better angels of our nature", a big-hearted view of the nation we were always meant to become and must be if we are to enter the 21st century as the model of liberal democracy and market-oriented capitalism the world needs to see.

<h3>Tougher Law Enforcement Is Driving Down Urban Crime</h3>

<hr size=3 width=50%>

<b>John J. DiIulio Jr.</b><br>

<b>Policy Review</b><br>

<i>Fall 1995, Number 74</i></center>

<p>

	Serious crime is declining in many big cities across America. That's the good news. Meanwhile, the country's largest and most violent cohort of young males will soon reach its crime-prone years. That's the bad news. But demography is not fate. Smarter law enforcement and tougher sentencing policies explain much of the recent drop in crime, and can minimize the damage from the next crime wave.
<p>	Between 1993 and 1994, the violent crime rate declined by 10 percent or more in eight of the 10 cities with the highest violent-crime rates (Miami, New York City, Los Angeles, Tallahassee, Baton Rouge, Little Rock, Jacksonville, and Pueblo, Colorado). In many cities, a sizable reduction in homicides accounts for much of the fall in these rates. For example, the number of murders in Atlanta, Chicago, and New Orleans together plummeted by 17 percent during the first half of 1995 compared with the same period a year ago.
<p>	New York City and Houston have enjoyed truly phenomenal drops in serious crimes, including murder. In 1992 and again in 1993, more than 1,900 homicides were committed in the Big Apple. But in 1994 New York City's  murder count fell to 1,581. Through July 1995, it suffered fewer than 700 murders, and it continued to show declines of 10 percent or more in robberies, burglaries, and most other serious crimes. Likewise, the number of people murdered in Houston declined by 32 percent during the first half of 1995 compared with same period a year ago. Rapes in Houston decreased by 21 percent, robberies by 15 percent, and the overall violent crime rate by 7 percent.
<p>	While New York City and Houston are leading the pack, other cities are catching up. During the first half of 1995, for example, the overall crime rate was down by more than 16 percent in San Francisco, 10 percent in San Antonio, and 6 percent in both Los Angeles and Philadelphia. And the number of murders declined by more than 6 percent in Philadelphia and Los Angeles, 9 percent in Detroit, and 10 percent in Boston and St. Louis.
<p>	What is going on here? Some criminologists dismiss the recent improvement in the crime rate as a mere statistical fluke. But it is hard to imagine that these downward trends, occurring in consecutive years in given jurisdictions, could have happened by chance. Others insist that the slide in crime rates is greased by a dwindling population of teenage boys. There is something to this claim, but it ignores the inconvenient fact that Houston and some other places with growing populations of at-risk youth have nonetheless experienced sharp reductions in crime.
<p>	Finally, a few criminologists have rushed to relate the dive in crime rates to everything from a sudden surge in the efficacy of gun control laws (which is patently absurd) to changes in the patterns of drug use (for example, the decline in crack-cocaine use which, they insist, has had nothing to do with anti-drug law enforcement). One much-quoted criminologist has even declared, "What goes up must come down."
<p>
<b>Bratton's Law: Enforcement Counts</b>
<p>	In many cities, the decline in crime rates can be explained at least in part by law-enforcement efforts that capitalize on community crime-fighting initiatives and take bad guys off the streets. I call this explanation Bratton's Law in honor of New York City's police commissioner, William Bratton. Like most veteran professionals in the justice system, Bratton understands perfectly well that crime rates are not determined solely by what cops, courts, and corrections agencies do. But his impatience with criminological cant about the inefficacy of policing practices and sentencing policies on crime rates is both ennobling and enlightening. Three brief examples illustrate Bratton's Law in action.
<P><ul>

<li><b>Jacksonville.</b> In July 1991, Harry L. Shorenstein became state attorney for the Fourth Judicial Circuit in Jacksonville, Florida. At that time Jacksonville was besieged by violent crime, much of it committed by juvenile offenders. In the year before Shorenstein arrived, juvenile arrests had risen by 27 percent, but most young habitual criminals were released quickly. Jacksonville's finest were doing their best to remove serious young criminals from the streets, but the rest of the system was not following suit.
<p>	Then, in March 1992, Shorenstein instituted an unprecedented program to prosecute and incarcerate dangerous juvenile offenders as adults. In most parts of the country, juvenile criminals for whom the law mandates adult treatment are not actually eligible for state prison sentences and are routinely placed on probation without serving any jail time. But Shorenstein's program was for real. He assigned 10 veteran attorneys to a new juvenile-prosecutions unit. Another attorney, funded by the Jacksonville Sheriffs Office, was assigned to prosecute repeat juvenile auto thieves.
<p>	By the end of 1994, the program had sent hundreds of juvenile offenders to Jacksonville's jails and scores more to serve a year or more in Florida's prisons. Jacksonville's would-be juvenile street predators got the message, and the effect of deterrence soon appeared in the arrest statistics. From 1992 to 1994, total arrests of juveniles dropped from 7,184 to 5,475. From 1993 to 1994, juvenile arrests increased nationwide and by over 20 percent in Florida. But Jacksonville had a 30 percent decrease in all juvenile arrests, including a 41 percent decrease in juveniles arrested for weapons offenses, a 45 percent decrease for auto theft, and a 50 percent decrease for residential burglary. Although Jacksonville still has a serious violent crime problem, the number of people murdered there during the first half of this year declined by 25 percent compared with the same period a year ago.<p>
<li><b>Houston.</b> Almost a thousand officers have been added to the city's police force since 1991. Led by Police Chief Sam Nuchia, Houston has a cost-effective police overtime program that puts more cops on the street when and where they are most needed. Residents of Washington, D.C., which fields the highest number of police officers per capita of any major city, know that more police manpower does not necessarily produce less crime or better police performance. But in Houston, Nuchia has used the additional manpower to jump-start community anti-crime activities.
<p>	To cite just one example, Houston's Citizen Patrol Program has operated in more than a hundred of the city's neighborhoods. Among other things, thousands of citizen patrollers have observed and reported suspicious or criminal behavior, from assaults to narcotics dealing to vandalism. Many once-troubled neighborhoods have gone as long as three consecutive months without needing to call for police service. Indeed, two recent studies found that Nuchia's enforcement efforts not only contributed to Houston's falling crime rates, but also improved police emergency response times, raised police productivity, and reduced citizens' fear of crime.<p>
<li><b>New York City.</b> Like Houston, New York City has greatly expanded its police force. Since 1990, the NYPD has grown by 7,000 officers. Under Bratton, police have been directed to crack down on public drinking, graffiti, vandalism, and other public disorders. The NYPD has beefed up action against street gangs and drug traffickers, returned to a policy of frisking suspects for guns and other weapons, and redoubled precinct-level efforts on a wide range of community-policing projects.<p>
	In the process, Bratton has promoted a new breed of precinct commanders and made them responsible for finding innovative, cost-effective ways of serving citizens and cutting crime in their neighborhoods. Despite recent corruption scandals, the precinct-based management system is working, NYPD morale is high, and New Yorkers are getting results that range from fewer aggressive panhandlers to fewer shootings and murders.
</ul><p>
<b>Criminologically Correct</b>
<p>	Why, then, are many criminologists so unwilling to admit that law enforcement can cut crime? Part of the answer is that more than a dozen major empirical studies over the last two decades have failed to demonstrate either that police manpower and crime rates vary inversely or that particular types of community-oriented policing practices prevent crime. The most famous of these studies is the Kansas City, Missouri, "preventive-patrol" experiment.
<p>	For a year in the early 1970s, Kansas City was divided into three areas, each of which received a different level of auto patrol. The 1974 report on the experiment found that criminal activity, reported crime, rates of victimization (as measured in a follow-up survey), citizen fear, and satisfaction with the police were about the same in all three areas. Active auto patrol -- beats where cars cruised the streets conspicuously two to three times more frequently than in the control areas --  no difference at all.
<p>But academic experts who treat such negative findings as the final words on the subject are badly mistaken. George L. Kelling of Northeastern University, the father of the Kansas City research and many other major studies, recently cautioned his colleagues that "generalizing from a study about a specific tactic to other tactics or uses of police is inappropriate." As Kelling observed, "random preventive patrol by automobile for the purpose of creating a feeling of police omnipresence" is a relic of "mid-century policing tactics."
<p>Kellling has scolded those "academic ideologists" in criminology who "do not let research interfere with their conclusions." He keenly characterizes as defeatist dogma their views that "crime stems from basic structural features of society, and until problems like homelessness, social injustice, economic inequalities, and racism are addressed, police impact on crime will be negligible."
<p>	As a matter of ideology, denying that law enforcement counts in cutting crime may be trendy, but the policy science of the subject remains far from settled. Following an exhaustive review of the empirical literature on policing, David H. Bayley of SUNYAlbany recently concluded that there has never been "a rigorous, clear-cut test of the association between the visible presence of the police and crime rates." Bayley is now in the early stages of a quasi-experimental study designed to test this relationship while controlling for demographic and other variables related to the incidence of crime. Such fine-tuned research on patrol presence, policing strategies, crime rates, and other key variables has become possible only in the past few years with the development of computer-assisted information systems for police dispatching and management.
<p>	Bayley's cutting-edge research will help to identify the general conditions under which tactics and increases in police manpower can curb public disorders and cut crime. For now, there is no solid evidence to dismiss, and every practical reason to uphold, Bratton's Law.
<p>
<b>Wattenberg's Law: Prison Works</b>
<p>	By the same token, there is tremendous empirical support for another proposition that many criminologists reflexively reject: Sentencing policies that keep violent and repeat criminals behind bars contribute mightily to reductions in crime.
<p>	I call this proposition Wattenberg's Law in honor of Ben Wattenberg, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and a nationally syndicated columnist. As Wattenberg has quipped, "A thug in prison can't shoot your sister." Whatever else incarceration buys us in the way of criminal deterrence, rehabilitation, or retribution, it most definitely pays dividends by preventing crimes that prisoners would commit if they were free.
<p>	The U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics has reported that fully 94 percent of state prisoners have committed one or more violent crimes or served a previous sentence in jail or on probation. Between 1980 and 1993, violent offenders were the greatest contributors to state prison population growth.
<p>	Even so, today more convicted violent offenders are serving time on probation and parole than in prison. About a third of all violent crime arrestees are on probation, parole, or pretrial release at the time of their arrest. Recent studies by me and others estimate that most prisoners commit between 12 and 21 serious crimes a year when on the loose.
<p>	From 1980 to 1992, the aggregate violent-crime rate in the 10 states where incarceration climbed the most decreased by 8 percent. In the 10 states with the lowest increases in incarceration, violent crime soared, in aggregate, 51 percent. A study published in Science calculated that in 1989 alone, the increased use of imprisonment spared Americans an estimated 66,000 rapes, 323,000 robberies, 380,000 assaults, and 3.3 million burglaries. In a research report targeted against California's three-strikes law (life without parole for thrice-convicted felons), the RAND Corp. conservatively estimated that the measure would spare Californians about 340,000 serious crimes a year.
<p>	Nationally, state prisoners convicted of violent crimes who were released in 1988 had served an average of only 43 percent of their sentences in confinement. Violent convicts released in 1992 had served an average of 48 percent of their time behind bars. And violent offenders released from state prisons this year will have served, on average, 50 to 52 percent of their time in confinement. This slow but steady increase in incarceration is the result of a nationwide trend toward tougher sentencing policies, and has already spared millions of Americans from serious crimes.
<p>	It is not yet possible to calculate precisely how much tougher incarceration policies have contributed to falling crime rates in particular cities. But in explaining New York City's falling crime rate, consider the fact that roughly half of New York's state prison population, and an even larger fraction of its violent offender population, comes from New York City. Over the last decade, the Empire State's prison rolls have more than doubled, and the amount of time served behind bars by violent and repeat criminals has increased by as much as 50 percent.
<p>
<b>DiIulio's Law: Be Prepared</b>
<p>	Apparently, it takes a Ph.D. in criminology to doubt that keeping dangerous criminals incarcerated cuts crime and to wonder whether releasing any significant fraction of the nation's 1 million prisoners tonight would result in more serious crime tomorrow.
<p>	But criminologists are right about one thing: Americans are sitting on a demographic crime bomb. Most predatory street crimes are committed by men under 25. Today there are about 7.5 million males aged 14 to 17. By the year 2000, we will have an additional 500,000. About 6 percent of young males are responsible for half the serious crimes committed by their age group. Thus, in five years we can expect at least 30,000 more young murderers, rapists, and muggers on the streets than we have today. Worse, since the 1950s each generational cohort of young male criminals has committed about three times more crime than the one before. Despite the recent decline in murder rates, homicides committed by 14- to 17-year-olds between 1985 and 1993 increased by 165 percent (more for minority males). The next wave of homicidal and near-homicidal violence among urban youth is bound to reach adjacent neighborhoods, inner-ring suburbs, and even the rural heartland.
<p>	This crime bomb probably cannot be defused. The large population of seven- to 10-year-old boys now growing up fatherless, Godless, and jobless -- and surrounded by deviant, delinquent, and criminal adults -- will give rise to a new and more vicious group of predatory street criminals than the nation has ever known. We must therefore be prepared to contain the explosion's force and limit its damage.
<p>	While there is some room for reasonable disagreements about policy tactics -- for example, whether the federal role in crime control should be expanded, or whether we should invest more in drug treatment or drug interdiction -- any effective anti-crime policy must advance one or more of three interlocking anti-crime strategies: hardening targets, targeting the hardened, and targeting resources.
<p>	<b>Hardening the Target.</b> Over the last decade or so, most Americans have taken steps to make the places where they live, work, go to school, or recreate impervious to crime. People have moved out of high-crime neighborhoods, installed anti-burglary devices, made crime-sensitive investment decisions, and lectured their children to be mindful of dangers. Businesses and the 32 million Americans who now live in privately governed residential communities have erected security gates and employed more than a million private security guards. 
<p>	Neighborhoods of every socioeconomic description have formed "town watch" associations and citizen patrol groups. And the poorest of the inner-city poor have battled the ACLU for the right to target-harden their homes, schools, and parks: They erect concrete barriers on streets frequented by drug dealers and prostitutes, evict convicted street thugs from public housing, install metal detectors, and institute random locker searches in public high schools, and more.
<p>	Though to a degree hard to quantify, such initiatives have contributed to recent decreases in crime rates and, over time, insulated us somewhat from the failures of our system of justice. But as the next crime wave approaches, we may well be nearing the limit of what private target-hardening measures can do to foster public safety.
<p>	Government at all levels, therefore, should do whatever can be done to bolster these protective measures. To offer just two of many possible examples, urban zoning decisions should begin to take into account the criminal consequences of permitting liquor outlets to be so heavily concentrated in high-crime, inner-city neighborhoods. Likewise, urban enterprise zones make sense as ways of giving <i>de facto</i> tax credits to businesses willing to locate in high-crime places.
<p><b>Targeting the Hardened.</b> At the same time, we must redouble our efforts to keep violent and repeat criminals behind bars. To consolidate and expand recent gains, we must be vigilant not only in pushing for truth-in-sentencing and three-strikes measures, but seeing to it that these laws are followed both in letter and in spirit.
	<p>Make no mistake: The counter-offensive against tougher sentencing policies is well underway. Aided and abetted by activist federal judges, prisoners' rights activists, journalists, and academic "experts," efforts are already being made to depict these laws as failures and to deny or disparage any suggestion that they have helped account for recent drops in crime rates.
<p>	But just ask the criminals. In California this year, within several months after the three-strikes law went into effect, an increasing number of parolees began to request inter-state transfers. Likewise, even before Washington State's three-strikes law hit the books in 1993, dozens of sex offenders called the Seattle Police Department with questions about what crimes might count as "strikes." As one career criminal told the detective in charge of the department's sex-offender unit, "It wasn't until [the three-strikes law] passed that I had to say to myself, 'Damn, these people are serious now.'"
<p>	As the next crime wave draws near, we must remain deadly serious about targeting hardened adult and juvenile criminals for arrest, prosecution, and incarceration. Anti-incarceration propagandists can be counted on to work overtime with much-publicized tales like the one about the California man whose "third strike" was stealing a slice of pizza from a child in a mall. They failed to note, however, that this criminal had four prior convictions.
<p>	Likewise, the anti-incarcerationists are sure to repeat canards about how tougher sentencing policies will bankrupt the country and result in massive prison overcrowding. In truth, we now spend less than half a penny of every tax dollar on prisons, and the costs of prisons can be reduced greatly by cutting back on inmate amenities and services that account for more than half of the prison budget in many states. 
<p>	As for "overcrowding," despite the growth in the prison population, fewer prisons today are operating over their rated capacity (the number of inmates they were designed to hold) than in 1990. And contrary to popular assertions, there is no systematic empirical evidence to show that double-celling raises the risk of prison disorders, inmate illness, or other serious problems.
<p>	Congress is taking steps to target the hardened, as it considers Title III of the Violent Criminal Incarceration Act adopted by the House last February. Known as the Stop Turning Out Prisoners or STOP law, this measure would prohibit activist federal judges from arbitrarily imposing prison caps that result each year in the early release of tens of thousands of dangerous criminals whose return to the streets results in murder and mayhem.
<p><b>Targeting Resources.</b> Whatever government does henceforth to combat crime should be done in a targeted fashion. It makes no sense, for example, to heed President Clinton's call for spending $8.8 billion in federal dollars for "100,000 cops." As I and many other analysts have proven, not only will that amount not pay for or even seed the funding of anything near 100,000 police officers, but the Justice Department's grant process is rigged to deliver lots of money to small cities that have enough cops and little crime. By the same token, however, it makes even less sense to follow the Republican alternative of dumping more than $10 billion on the states in open-ended anticrime block grants.
<p>	So here is DiIulio's Law: Over the next five years, as our euphoria over good news about crime fades and a public panic to "do something" about youth crime begins, let us prepare to honor the overarching conservative principle that government should never spend money it does not have for purposes it has not clearly articulated in order to generate results that cannot easily be evaluated.

	The Legal Services Corp. (LSC) exists ostensibly to provide legal counsel in civil matters to people who cannot afford it. Since it was set up as a quasi-independent government corporation in 1974, it has weathered accusations that it promotes an activist, ideological agenda at the expense of its poor clients, and it has survived numerous attempts at abolition or reform.<p>
	Now the House Budget Committee, under the leadership of its chairman, Congressman John Kasich of Ohio, has proposed to phase out its annual appropriation, currently at $400 million, over the next two years. American Bar Association President George Bushnell has defended the program and has called LSC critics "reptilian bastards." Numerous defenders of the LSC have taken to the floor of Congress to denounce proposals to trim funding for the agency on the grounds that without it, America's poor will be deprived of civil legal representation.<p>
	We offer a twofold answer. First, Americans should realize that the LSC is not the noble bulwark of the rights of the poor that its supporters claim. Its effectiveness at serving the poor has always been marred by its pursuit of a political agenda that wastes effort and money and at times works to the long-term detriment of the poor. <p>
	Second, alternatives to the LSC do exist. Private legal-aid societies predated federally-funded legal services by almost 90 years, and would be thriving today had the lure of federal money not ensnared many of them. Other alternatives flourish in spite of the hostility of groups such as LSC grantees and the organized bar.<p>
	On a political level, the legal-services "movement," as it styles itself, is a 30-year success story. Since its founding as part of Lyndon Johnson's "War on Poverty," it has pursued its agenda virtually unimpeded. It has withstood budget cuts and a challenge to its existence in the Reagan years, when it waged an extensive "survival campaign." During the 1990s, it has enjoyed increasing appropriations. Its grantees receive an additional $255 million per year (as of 1993) from state and local governments, money from interest on many accounts that lawyers hold in trust for their clients (known as IOLTA funds), and private sources. Its biggest achievement, however, has been securing astronomical amounts of money for recipients of government programs. The movement, however, must face up to a crisis even greater than Republican opposition in Congress: The entire rationale for its existence is flawed:<p>
	<b>Misunderstood needs.</b> The LSC was created to provide help in civil cases. Most legal problems that poor people face fall into several basic categories: family law, including divorce, custody, guardianship, and child-support issues; housing, including disputes between landlords and tenants; financial issues, including bankruptcy, wills, estates, and credit problems; employment law; public benefits; prisoner rights; and immigration.<p>
  LSC supporters say that if it were not for the LSC, the 1.6 million poor people it assisted last year would be without any legal recourse whatsoever. The LSC itself proclaims its inadequacy to meet the needs of the poor by asserting that demand for its services vastly outstrips the $400 million provided by the federal government. The agency pleads for ever-increasing amounts of money on the basis of studies conducted by the American Bar Association (ABA) and in several states. These studies purport to show that only a minority of the legal needs of the poor are being met. The state studies asserted that the range was 14 to 23 percent of need.<p>
	Their methodology appears defective, however, because they fail to distinguish between "unmet" and "unrecognized" legal needs. Poor people were contacted randomly by phone, mail, or in person and asked whether they had problems in various areas, such as housing. If they responded that they had a problem with roaches, for instance, it was counted as an unmet legal need, even if the person had no intention of involving a lawyer in solving the problem. Under the consumer category, the most frequent problem cited was "turned down for credit." Many people are denied credit, but very few hire a lawyer. Yet, these responses were considered unmet legal needs.<p>
	<b>Misdirected agenda.</b> Even if we took these claims at face value, it's not hard to see why LSC resources don't go very far, because many LSC grantees have other plans for their money. Sixteen LSC grantees known as "support centers" provide virtually no direct legal services to the poor. They are organized to address specific issues such as housing, welfare, immigration, youth, and food. National in scope, the support centers often initiate litigation far from their offices. In 1993, the San Francisco-based National Center for Youth Law forced Arkansas to expand its child welfare system, and won $314,107 in legal fees for itself in the process. <p>	The real agenda of the federal legal-services program is "law reform." It is not to serve the needs of poor individuals, but to "rescue" the poor as a class from poverty through litigated increases in transfer payments. However well-intentioned, this mission suffers from the same contradiction as the "War on Poverty" itself. The welfare state has not led men and women out of poverty but instead created dependency and a permanent underclass. As long as the LSC dedicates itself to bolstering and expanding the welfare state, it will fail to "meet the needs" even as it defines them itself.<p>	Nevertheless, federally-funded legal services pursues its goal of law reform to effect a redistribution of income. Through class-action suits and lawsuits against local, state, and federal governments, LSC grantees have won hundreds of billions of dollars in expanded rights to welfare, Medicaid, and food-stamp benefits. In recent years, LSC grantees have sought to protect earlier gains by filing suits to obstruct or stop welfare reform in nearly every state in which it has been attempted. Yet a consensus seems to exist among political parties that the current welfare system has been eroding the family and fostering dependency for more than a generation. Expansion of benefits under the current system hardly seems like a compassionate cause on behalf of the poor.<p>	After year
s of abetting dependency by winning more social welfare benefits for more classes of people, LSC grantees have turned to pursuits overtly destructive of the poor. In dozens of cities, the legal-services movement has prevented local public-housing authorities from evicting drug dealers. LSC grantees have signed up thousands of alcoholics and substance abusers for Social Security Disability Insurance benefits. They have also litigated to protect aggressive panhandling and to establish the right to camp in city parks and streets. Some legal-services litigation has undermined parental rights and family cohesion. For example, some LSC grantees have sued to force housing authorities to lease apartments to unmarried minors.<p>	
<b>Bureaucratic structure.</b> The LSC is wedded to providing services by the so-called "staff attorney" model, which is essentially a bureaucratic model. A legal-services office is manned by lawyers who are employed by the program. An indigent person walks in the door, describes his or her problem, and a legal-services attorney decides whether to take the case. The LSC grantee is under no obligation to render assistance, and often does not. Instead of setting priorities in response to individual needs, LSC grantees may select cases according to their potential for advancing a social agenda.<p><b>A Prime Alternative </b><p>	In evaluating how the LSC is doing, it is worthwhile to look at two groups in Indianapolis that provide legal help to the poor. The Indianapolis Legal Aid Society (ILAS) was founded in 1941 and last year received all of its $458,000 budget from private sources, primarily the United Way. The Legal Services Organization of Indiana (LSOI), on the other hand, was founded in 1966 as part of the federal legal-services program. Last year it received 84 percent of its $4.5 million budget in grants from the LSC, and another 12 percent from other government sources.<p>
	One might think that the group with the larger budget does a more effective job serving the poor. Unfortunately, it does not. In 1994, ILAS handled 6,079 cases while LSOI says that it handled 12,347. (A LSOI brochure complains that it was forced to reject over 6,000 additional cases "due to budgetary restraints.") The private group handled one-half as many cases on one-tenth of the LSC grantee's budget. That works out to an expenditure of $75 per case for ILAS and $367 for LSOI.<p>
	A closer look at these figures, however, may point to an even greater disparity. The ILAS figure of 6,079 includes only those cases that were actually contested, whether they went to trial or not. It does not include consultations and referrals. On the other hand, the LSOI figure of 12,347 appears to include brief consultations and the like. It reported to the LSC that it closed only 1,273 litigated cases in 1994! <P>
	ILAS materials state that it is "non-partisan and non-ideological" and does not engage in class-action suits. On the other hand, LSOI employs a full-time lobbyist and has, for example, filed a class action suit to stop implementation of Indiana governor Evan Bayh's welfare-reform plan.<p>
	Another difference is that ILAS does not take cases on behalf of individuals seeking benefits under government welfare programs. Public-benefits cases are a significant part of the LSOI caseload, and they are sometimes zealously pursued. For instance, LSOI sued Indiana in 1993 to continue AFDC benefits to a parent even though her children had been removed from the home because she failed to exercise responsibility for their care. <p>
<b>Life after the LSC</b><p>	The most remarkable thing about the private ILAS is that it exists at all. Private legal-aid societies like ILAS numbered in the hundreds across the country until the 1960s, when the federal government began offering direct grants to legal aid organizations <a href="#destroy">(See sidebar)</a>. ILAS was in the minority that resisted. Since 1974, each LSC grantee has enjoyed automatic refunding. The money flows to the same agencies, often administered by the same personnel, year after year. The system has never employed competitive grant procedures. Only a handful of programs have been defunded, and the LSC has not even tried to defund one since 1986. Scant evidence exists of innovation or experimentation with different approaches to meeting the legal needs of the poor. Luckily, others within the legal profession are meeting the challenge.<p>
	 <b>Expanded "judicare."</b> A preferable alternative to the LSC's staff attorney model is "judicare," offering legal services based on the so-called British System. Under judicare, an indigent client employs the private attorney of his or her choice, who is reimbursed by the government in accordance with a set schedule of fees. The LSC has funded only a few judicare programs, presumably because they offer little opportunity to practice so-called law reform.
<p>	In 1983, long-time judicare advocate Samuel Jan Brakel made his case this way: "What point or purpose is there in having a separate legal-aid establishment for the poor, staffed overwhelmingly by young and inexperienced lawyers, armed with a socio-political agenda and a whole folklore about what poor clients want, need, or what is good for them? Why patronize low-income people in this way? Why deprive them of the diversity of views, practices, and talents that abound in the private sector? Why deny them the right to choose their own lawyers? In no other area of social or human service that I am aware of have we made such a concerted, almost perverse, effort to avoid using the resources already existent and available."<p>
	In South Carolina, the LSC funds a judicare program called Legal Services of the Fourth Judicial District. This is an excellent model for private legal aid to the poor. Covering six counties, the program contracts with fifty-two private attorneys who receive referrals from a staff member in each county. According to the South Carolina Bar Foundation, last year the other five LSC programs in the state budgeted between 42 percent and 50 percent of their resources to direct client services, whereas the Fourth Judicial District group budgeted 68 percent.<p>
	Executive Director Robert Adams claims that he offers better service, too. "By offering the services of 52 panel attorneys, we feel the clients have access to a diversity of legal expertise instead of limiting them to a few staff attorneys." Adams also points out that new attorneys starting practices in small communities have benefited and have seen clients return as paying clients. Adams also notes that "our program has never been involved in class action suits, abortions, or fee generating cases."<p>
	<b><i>Pro bono</i> legal work.</b> While overstating legal needs of the poor, LSC proponents understate services that are already available, particularly in the amount level of <i>pro bono</i> legal work. <i>Pro bono</i> is a shortening of <i>pro bono publico</i> which means "for public good." It refers to legal help rendered to a client by a private attorney for no fee or a reduced fee.
<p>	The LSC underplays the amount of free legal work that is done in order to aggrandize the agency's importance. In May 1995, LSC chairman Douglas Eakeley and LSC president Alex Forger testified in Congress that 130,000 attorneys do <i>pro bono</i> work. But this figure is the number of attorneys who are formally enrolled in organized pro bono programs affiliated with LSC grantees.<p>
	The actual number doing <i>pro bono</i> work, including work on an ad hoc basis, is much higher. Although no national study exists, studies in individual states provide some useful data. A 1991 study by the State Bar of California reported that 64 percent of its members engaged in some form of voluntary, uncompensated legal work. A 1994 New York State Bar Association report put the figure at 49 percent. The American Bar Foundation places the total number of attorneys in the United States in 1995 at 896,000. If one adopts a rather conservative assumption that at least 40 percent engage in <i>pro bono</i> work, the number is 358,400, between two and three times the number cited by Eakeley and Forger.
<p>	Eakeley and Forger went on to testify that "<i>pro bono</i> services from private attorneys are at an all-time high primarily because of the efforts of the organized bar, the LSC, and local programs to involve private attorneys in the delivery of legal services." They were correct in pointing out that <i>pro bono</i> is at an all time high, but wrong to award the LSC a central role. During the 1980s, the ABA put a new stress on attorneys' <i>pro bono</i> obligation. A 1988 ABA resolution asked all attorneys to devote at least 50 hours per a year. An ABA directory of <i>pro bono</i> programs published in 1984 had 300 entries. The 1993-94 edition contained over 900 programs and indicates that no more than 375 of the programs are substantially supported by LSC grantees. (Some grantees are involved with more than one program.) Thus, the majority of <i>pro bono</i> programs would exist without the LSC and they are today more numerous than all the programs existing in 1984.
<p>	The LSC's involvement with <i>pro bono</i> largely stems from a somewhat modest attempt in the 1980s by the Reagan-appointed LSC board to provide competition to the staff-attorney system. Grantees were required to establish a "private-attorney involvement program," on which they must spend 12.5 percent of their annual federal grant. The attitude of the legal-services "movement" toward pro bono has often been hostile. Some LSC <i>pro bono</i> programs are notoriously inefficient. For instance, Legal Services Organization of Indiana managed to spend $408,867 in 1994 on a program that supposedly relied on voluntary help. It closed just 668 cases at an average cost of $612 per case.
<p>	Legal-services groups can only assist clients whose annual income is within 125 percent of the poverty level. Often, individuals cannot afford a lawyer, but have incomes which exceed this level. For example, Bay Area Legal Services, the LSC grantee in Tampa, Florida, was turning away a hundred legitimate cases a week because the clients earned too much. In response, 35-year-old real-estate attorney Mike Bedke sought to address the problem by launching the Courthouse Assistance Project. Except for office space provided by the Clerk of the Hillsborough County Court, the program receives no government support. It is staffed by volunteer attorneys who help 300 individuals per month right in the Courthouse on a first-come, first-served basis. Attorneys answer questions, help people fill out forms, and tell them what to expect in court. According to Bedke, "A lot of times we don't even have to help them file a lawsuit. It's a matter of resolving a dispute over the phone, writing a letter for them, or directing them to a particular agency."<p>
	Bedke, a board member of Bay Area Legal Services, says that Bay Area directors worried that the new program would compete for resources, but that he has found a "new class" of volunteers to staff the project. Bedke explains that many attorneys felt that Bay Area represented "welfare queens" and that they are much more willing to help clients who have jobs and are trying to get ahead. Through his position as chairman of the ABA's Young Lawyers Division, Bedke has been seeking to spread the program to other cities; so far 14 have emulated the Tampa project. Another two dozen have expressed interest.
<P>	Bedke says part of his inspiration came from a six-year-old Richmond, Virginia, project aimed specifically at the working poor. Hunton & Williams, the largest law firm in southeastern United States, opened an office in a basement in a distressed Richmond neighborhood.<p>
	Last year, the office handled about 600 client representations for a flat $50 fee, plus out-of-pocket expenses. For every reduced-fee client representation, the office handled two to three more consultations free of charge, usually resulting in some resolution short of legal action or a referral to another agency. Clients may earn up to twice the LSC eligibility level, although eligibility is not strenuously investigated, freeing time for the staff to work on actual cases. According to George H. Hettrick, a partner in the firm, "We believe the $50 fee is a good thing for the client. That person feels like a real client and not the recipient of charity. When people are given dignity, it fosters a more successful lawyer-client relationship."
<p>	The Hunton & Williams office in Church Hill receives no government support whatsoever. It is staffed by 60 of the firm's lawyers, who put in an average of 40 to 60 hours per year. The office handles housing, family, and guardianship cases, three types of cases shunned by private attorneys. In the housing category, the office not only handles landlord/tenant disputes, but also closings for first time home buyers, and the closings for the new owners of homes built or rehabilitated by Habitat for Humanity and other housing programs.
<p>
	<b>Alternative dispute resolution.</b> More and more poor people are avoiding legal services altogether by turning to Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR). Informal ADR procedures like conciliation, arbitration, and mediation have enjoyed explosive growth in recent years. <p>
	The programs run the gamut from taxpayer-supported programs affiliated with state court systems to private, neighborhood programs. In New York, all 62 counties now have a Community Dispute Resolution Center. Each center is a private, nonprofit agency with a contract with the state court system. The program was established in 1981 with the support of both liberals and conservatives in the state legislature. By 1988, every county had one. Each currently receives up to 50 percent of its budget from the state. The balance is raised from local governments and private sources, like the United Way. New York will provide a total of $3.1 million for fiscal year 1995. 
<p>	Administered by a staff of four in Albany, the program depends on 2,254 trained volunteer mediators from all walks of life, including housewives and retirees. Most are nonlawyers. By any measure, the statistics quoted by the program's statewide office are impressive. In fiscal year 1994, the centers conducted 25,015 conciliations, mediations, and arbitrations involving 63,210 people. The first step is conciliation, where an attempt is made to work out the problem by phone or mail. If that doesn't work, the parties actually meet face-to-face with a mediator present. In 79 percent of the matters that reached the mediation stage, a voluntary agreement was reached. If there is still no resolution, the parties go to arbitration. <P>
	In fiscal year 1994, it took 16 days from the intake to final disposition for the average single-hearing case and 41 days for the average multi-hearing case. There were 13,609 cases involving a single hearing and just 623 requiring more than one. The average time per mediation or arbitration was one hour and 11 minutes. The average cost to the state for each case screened as appropriate for dispute resolution was $68. The average state cost per conciliation, mediation, and arbitration was $121. The centers reported $2,919,276 awarded in fiscal year 1994 in restitution and through mutual agreements. The average award per case was $788.
<p>	The centers are open to anyone. State courts make both voluntary and mandatory referrals, accounting for about half of the caseload. Clients may seek advice from lawyers, but very few disputants use them. A review of the disputes handled shows that they include those common to the poor. Thirty-four percent involved allegations of harassment, 24 percent alleged breach of contract, 7 percent housing, 7 percent interpersonal disputes, 7 percent assault, 4 percent personal or real property, and 4 percent custody, support, or visitation.<p>
	Interestingly, many dispute-resolution programs handle minor criminal cases. Thus, the approach to dispute resolution is comprehensive. Its goal is to prevent the escalation of problems, especially among people who know each other. A mutually acceptable resolution of a simple trespass case can prevent an assault later on. Sixteen percent of the disputes were between neighbors, 15 percent between acquaintances, 13 percent between tenants and landlords, 9 percent between consumers and merchants, 6 percent between family members, 4 percent between former boyfriends and girlfriends, and 4 percent between strangers. <p>
	According to the National Institute for Dispute Resolution, 27 states have formally incorporated various ADR methods into their court systems, up from just 10 in 1980. The National Center for State Courts reports that at least 1,200 programs around the nation are receiving referrals from state courts.
<p>	 One doesn't have to live in New York to take advantage of ADR. "Neighborhood justice centers" now exist in many urban areas around the country. Some receive support from local governments and some are privately funded. Some receive referrals from local courts and some do not. What they have in common is a minimum of bureaucracy and a reliance on volunteers to serve as third-party referees. The federal role in the development of these institutions is instructive. In 1978, the Justice Department dispensed 18-month seed grants to three neighborhood justice programs in Kansas City, Atlanta, and Los Angeles. Smaller grants were also provided for another year of operation. But in contrast to the automatic refunding enjoyed by LSC grantees, the programs were on their own in the third year. The programs survived and centers in other cities blossomed with no federal seed money at all. Today, there are several hundred community and neighborhood justice centers. The National Association for Community Mediation has 150 programs in 37 states.<p>
<b>	Services by nonlawyers.</b> Along with ADR, nonlawyer practice (NLP) is growing rapidly. Independent paralegals and other specialists are performing tasks previously reserved for licensed attorneys. Nonlawyer practitioners handle such matters as uncontested divorces, wills, estates, bankruptcies, real estate closings, child custody and support, and immigration problems. They appear before 38 federal agencies. Many LSC-eligible clients take advantage of these services. Help Abolish Legal Tyranny (HALT), a Washington-based legal reform advocacy group, estimates that 5,000 independent paralegals (paralegals not employed by an attorney) are currently working in private practice. 
<p>	There would be more if not for the bitter opposition of state bar associations. These powerful groups lobby for "unauthorized practice of law" (UPL) statutes, which are on the books in every state except Arizona. The vast majority of UPL complaints are not filed by dissatisfied consumers, but by members of the bar. Not only has for-profit NLP been targeted for formal complaints, but also individuals and non-profit organizations that have been helping the poor. The most celebrated case is that of Rosemary Furman, a legal secretary who escaped going to jail in the mid-1980s. Her crime was to charge a small fee for helping battered women fill out civil protection orders and divorce forms. HALT says that it gets an average of two calls per week from nonlawyers being investigated or charged under UPL.<p>
	The LSC has fought competition from nonlawyers. In Jacksonville, Florida, nonlawyer Susan Longley operated American Legal Clinic, Inc., now known as American Documents Clinic, Inc. Among other things, Longley assisted people in the preparation of Chapter 13 bankruptcy filings. She handled a filing for Sandra Samuels for $215, saving her home from foreclosure. Jacksonville Area Legal Aid, Inc., an LSC grantee, soon after launched a successful UPL action against Longley, and in December 1994 was awarded $5,316.20 in legal fees even though the judge found that the client had not been harmed in any way.<p>
	In response to the NLP phenomena, the ABA formed a Commission on Nonlawyer Practice scheduled to make a report in 1996, but most state bar association officials remain deadset against any increased role for NLP. Most argue that clients are put at risk by nonlawyers handling legal problems. But former New Jersey Bar President Thomas Curtin was quoted in the July 3, 1995, <i>Lawyers Weekly</i>, "I have no difficulty saying my position is protecting the interests of lawyers. Why is the ABA, an organization that is supposed to working for lawyers, trying to find work for nonlawyers? That is not the business of the ABA. This is the American Bar Association, not the American Paralegal Association."
<p>	<b>Do-it-yourself.</b> In her unsuccessful fight to offer legal services, Longley was also enjoined from using any computer program or legal form designed for use by attorneys. It is easy to see why lawyers are concerned about these tools. Self-help legal publications and computer programs are enjoying expanded sales. Ralph Warner, the editor of NOLO Press of Berkeley, California, estimates that how-to legal publications are now a $50 million business. One of NOLO's most popular titles is "How to File for Bankruptcy." Another is "Plan Your Estate." Its most popular software package, allowing individuals to create their own wills, sold 60,000 last year. <p><b>What to Do?</b>
<p>	The best thing the government can do for the poor is to do away with the LSC. The agency won't go willingly, so Congress should abolish it. Additionally, care should be exercised in replacing it with something else. The potential of unintended consequences is a central lesson of the last 30 years. A number of ideas have been proposed, but should be discarded: <p><ul>	<li>"Reform" of the Legal Services Corp. No new regulations or restrictions can reform a program founded on a flawed premise <a href="#reform">(see sidebar)</a>. <li>A federal judicare program. The last thing the country needs is Medicare for lawyers. State and locally-funded judicare programs are worthy of support, particularly in rural areas.<li>Block grants to the states. Preferable to the present LSC-grant system, they may be useful during a phase out of federal funding. Block grants pose the danger, however, of preserving a federal role in legal services.<li>Mandatory <i>pro bono. Pro bono</i> should not result from coercion. It is a violation of attorneys' free association rights and undercuts the voluntary spirit necessary for successful <i>pro bono</i> work.</ul><p>
	How then should the legal needs of the poor be met? First, it should be recognized that there are certain needs the poor don't have. Without deep pockets, they seldom get sued. When injured or harmed due to the negligence of others, there is no need for a taxpayer-provided lawyer. All a victim has to do is to call the number on the television screen. Plenty of private lawyers await with open arms to take contingency cases.<p>
	Second, it should also be recognized that many of the present legal problems of the poor do not require lawyers. Deregulation of the legal profession will provide disproportionate relief to the poor. ADR and NLP are well suited for many of the kinds of problems the poor encounter.<p>
	Third, legal needs which actually require a lawyer should not be established on the basis of self-serving and nonsensical studies sponsored by federal grant recipients. It may be impossible to quantify legal needs in the first place. In our lawyer-rich society, legal problems are whatever clever lawyers decide to bring forth. Actual needs can only be established by poor people themselves exercising free choice. A federal income-tax deduction for <i>Pro bono</i> work would help make the system client-based, rather than attorney-based. Such an incentive was proposed by GOP Congressman Henry Hyde of Illinois in the early 1980s with a monetary cap on the total deduction. 
<p>	The good news is that an expansion of <i>pro bono</i> work is already underway and the legal profession has been aggressively promoting it, notwithstanding ABA support for the LSC. Ending the federal legal-services program would further oblige attorneys to assist the poor. The existence of a federal program has undoubtedly provided some attorneys with the rationale to shirk responsibilities in their own communities. A federal income tax deduction is not a panacea, however. The success of <i>pro bono</i> should not be dependent on the availability of a tax deduction, but on a renewal of the voluntary spirit of members of the bar.<p>
	 Many attorneys will be more likely to engage in <i>pro bono</i> in a structured program, and there are many areas where a storefront, walk-in office would a tremendous convenience for the poor and working poor. As is being demonstrated in Indianapolis, a private institution can serve the poor better than a public one. We should work to restore the ethos of the private legal-aid society that not dependent on government funds.<p>
	Indeed, the private legal-aid society can serve as a useful model for LSC grantees if they should lose federal funding. The transition to a nonfederal system will not be tumultuous. As noted, LSC grantees already receive $255 million from non-LSC sources. Unlike other federal programs, LSC grantees may carry over surpluses each year, and some programs have significant reserves socked away. A simple policy decision to stop doing class-action suits, public-benefits cases, advocacy, and lobbying would allow most grantees to help more poor individuals, even on a reduced budget. If programs are truly providing a valuable service, they should be able to raise money locally.<p>
	Ultimately, legal services for the poor cannot be separated from legal services for everyone. Problems of affordability and accessibility are not limited to the poor or working poor. Our society threatens to become "overrun by hordes of lawyers, hungry as locusts," as Warren Burger, the late chief justice of the Supreme Court, put it. Reducing litigation and lowering its cost through tort reform and other measures would benefit everyone. Getting lawyers out of lives of Americans, including the poor, is the real point.

<a name="destroy"><b>The Destruction of Legal-Aid Societies </b></a><br>
	The Legal Aid Society of New York was the nation's first, opening its doors with one part-time attorney in 1876. Private societies numbered more than 200 by the mid-1960s and, except in a few municipalities, received no government support. Overall, about 60 percent of their financial support came from community chests, 15 percent from bar associations, and the rest from individuals and businesses.
<p>	An 89-year-old tradition of private legal aid ended in 1965 when the federal government began making direct grants to legal-aid organizations through the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), a cornerstone of Lyndon Baines Johnson's "War on Poverty." The previously private societies constituted 60 percent of the grantees of the new  federal program. 
<P>	With federal funding came dramatic change. Sargent Shriver's OEO spearheaded a shift in emphasis to "law reform," the expansion of poverty benefits through litigation. The directors and staffs of many programs resented Washington setting local priorities, but were quickly overwhelmed. The law gave the OEO powers to award grants to antipoverty agencies on any basis. <p>
	The introduction of federal funds provided huge power to the small but highly ideological OEO staff to set priorities and demand changes in local organizations. Few local aid societies and bar organizations could resist the allure of new federal funds. The annual budgets of the private legal-aid societies totaled about $4 million in 1964. The federal program initially promised an annual expenditure 10 times that amount to groups administered or heavily influenced by local bar groups. In cases where the existing legal-aid operation refused to remake itself to the OEO's liking, a competing organization was founded and funded instead. By 1967, the OEO was distributing $42 million to 300 organizations. The OEO's crash campaign resulted in a network of law offices and attorneys equal in size to the U.S. Department of Justice and all its U.S. Attorney offices.  <p>
	The OEO placed its own personnel in programs it funded through something called the Reginald Heber Smith Fellowship Program. Beginning in 1967, young attorneys were recruited and trained in the principles and tactics of "poverty law." Sent out to local grantees, the "Reggies" remained employees of the Smith program.<p>
	By 1971, 25 percent of all LSC lawyers were graduates of the program. Fred Speaker, an OEO official at the time, expressed the OEO attitude to the formerly private groups: "We are a program that six years ago rose out of the sloth of token, tired, 19th-century legal-aid societies." Private institutions were not just crowded out by public ones, but were actively undermined and infiltrated in a campaign akin to a corporate takeover.<p>	 "Law reform" proceeded at a furious pace. By 1972, some 219 cases had been brought all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court by LSC attorneys. Under the former private system, not one case had ever gone that far. Through the end of 1972, some $290 million in federal funds had been spent on legal services, but the cost to the taxpayer was actually more than $2 billion. 
<P>	In 1973, President Nixon proposed to dismantle the OEO, and appointed as its director Howard Phillips, who promptly canceled "law reform" as a goal. Congressional supporters of legal services moved to "insulate" the program from "political pressure" and sought to establish an independent Legal Service Corp. (LSC), along the lines of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Richard Nixon signed the Legal Services Corp. Act on July 25, 1974the last legislation he signed before resigning. During congressional hearings this year, LSC officials pointed out that Nixon created the LSC, but they did not mention that liberal senators were holding up funds for his Watergate defense at the time.<p>
	The new LSC has dispensed funds in much the same way as the OEO did. According to Indiana University Law Professor William F. Harvey, a director of the Indianapolis Legal Aid Society and chairman of the LSC during the 1980s, "The effort to undermine the private legal-aid societies continued under the LSC, particularly during the chairmanship of Hillary Rodham Clinton [1978-80]. The Washington-based LSC ideologues cannibalized the standards, criteria, the concepts, even the esprit de corps of America's legal-aid societies."

<a name="reform"><b>Why the LSC Cannot Be Reformed (sidebar)</b></a><br>
	Responding to criticism of the Legal Services Corp. (LSC), the agency's defenders in Washington favor reform over elimination. But the LSC is not reformable. The Legal Services Corp. Act of 1974, which created the corporation, allows it to take public funds$400 million this yearand transforms them into private funds, immune from the checks that apply to other types of federal spending.
<p>	The law also established a unique, hybrid structure for the corporation that guarantees it can never be accountable. The LSC is an independent, private, nonprofit corporation that makes grants to 323 separately incorporated private nonprofit grantees. The LSC's 11-member board is appointed by the president, subject to Senate confirmation, but the board has little actual influence over the grantees and how they spend their grants. Nor does the executive branch have much influence over the LSC budget. By law, it goes straight from the LSC to Congress, and the Office of Management and Budget may only review it.<p>
	The LSC's status as a private corporation exempts it from many federal criminal laws pertaining to government officials, such as the Anti-Deficiency Act. Although it is a felony for a federal official to misappropriate federal funds, the LSC Act frustrates operation of that law by declaring that "officers and employees of the Corporation shall not be considered officers and employees" of the federal government.<p>
	From time to time, Congress and the LSC board have sought in vain to exercise oversight. Restrictions on LSC involvement in abortion, Congressional redistricting, politics, lobbying, and advocacy have been ignored or circumvented, primarily through the nonfederal funds "dodge." Since most grantees receive some funding from IOLTA and state and local governments, they are able to claim that any restricted activities are not done with their LSC funds.<p>
	There is no way to verify this because legal-services attorneys do not keep time sheets, thereby eliminating the only means of federal oversight. Furthermore, legal-services lawyers do not report the cases on which they work to anyone beyond their offices, and all case records are off limits. This secrecy, shielded by an invocation of the attorney-client privilege, prevents Congress from evaluating the effectiveness of any legal-services program. There are no provisions for the privilege to be waived for purposes of oversight, even though the overseers have paid for the services. <p>
	As a result of these factors, we have little information on expenditures by case or by category or service. While most government programs are required to have detailed accounting systems to explain how taxpayer money is used, the LSC has continued to ask for funding increases without offering any detailed evidence that previous funding has been used well.<p>
	The LSC can track the use of its grants through a monitoring program that includes on-site visits by Washington-based staff. During the Bush administration, about 125 visits took place annually, meaning the average program could expect a visit once every three years. Under the Clinton-appointed board, only six monitoring visits took place last year.<p>
	The LSC structure is ripe for abuse, and abuses will be rampant as long as it exists. It makes little difference who is in the White House, the Congress, or on the LSC board. As long as funds flow through the 323 LSC grantees, public funds will continue to be spent by private citizens pursuing a private political agenda. As Alan Houseman, a legal theorist who helped draft the 1974 Act, wrote in 1984, "Since the central directions of the program were not created by statutes or regulations, they are invariably difficult to undo by regulations and LSC policies."

<b>Policy Review</b><br>

<i>Fall 1995, Number 74</i></center>

<p>

	The 1994 term of the Supreme Court cast into stark relief the performances of Justices Clarence Thomas and David Souter. Justice Thomas emerged as the boldest member of the Court in half a century -- a jurist committed to seeking the original meaning of the Constitution in lengthy and learned opinions that survey the vast scope of American constitutional history. On the other hand, Justice Souter, while continuing his move to the Court's liberal wing, tended to write jejune opinions seemingly intent on avoiding the central issues of the case. It is as if Thomas and Souter keep alive in the public sphere the paradoxical qualities of the president who appointed them both. Thomas represents the bold and fearless George Bush who prosecuted the Gulf War and stood by Thomas in his contentious confirmation hearings, while Souter represents the reticent George Bush who was inattentive to conservative principles in many areas of domestic policy.
<p>	Given the excellent prospects in 1996 for a new president inclined to appoint conservative justices, it is appropriate to analyze the differences between these justices to aid the new president in choosing nominees in the mold of Thomas rather than Souter. I then propose a few criteria for choosing the next nominee that will maximize the chances of selecting an outstanding justice who will help ensure principled constitutional governance into the next century.
<p>	Liberal and conservative commentators alike agree on one proposition about the most recent Supreme Court term: Thomas became a force to be reckoned with. Tony Mauro, a liberal Court watcher, wrote of Thomas's "bold and searching" opinions. Burt Neuborne, a professor at New York University Law School and the former director of the ACLU, was struck by Justice Thomas's "vigorous tone" in his many "interesting and important opinions." James Kilpatrick wrote of his "masterly" work. George Will gave what may be a conservative's highest accolade for a judge: Thomas's opinions, he wrote, were "Borkean."
<p>	Indeed, the most striking characteristic of Thomas's opinions was one he shares with Judge Robert Bork -- a willingness to go back to first principles to uncover the meaning of the Constitution. In case after case where the original meaning of the Constitution was put in issue by the litigants or other justices, such as those involving term limits, the extent of Congress's authority under the Commerce Clause, and the protection afforded anonymous pamphlets under the First Amendment, Thomas wrote magisterial opinions that investigated the original understanding of the Constitution in detail. To be sure, not all of his opinions investigated all possible originalist angles of a case. But this is only to be expected, given the way issues are framed on the Court. Thomas is not a law professor, completely at liberty to approach every case without reference to the framework in which his colleagues or the litigants are operating. Nevertheless, his opinions undoubtedly represent the most impressive set of originalist opinions ever written by a Supreme Court justice within a single term. 
<p>	  Thomas's opinion in <i>U.S. Term Limits v. Thornton</i> was emblematic of his approach. The issue in the case was whether the states could preclude individuals who had served a certain number of terms as a senator or member of the House of Representatives from again appearing on the ballot for that office. The Constitution sets out certain qualifications for both representatives and senators. For instance, as to members of the House of Representatives, the Constitution provides, "No Person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the Age of twenty five Years and been seven Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen."
<p>	The analysis in the majority opinion in <i>Thornton</i> rested on the proposition that these qualifications were exclusive. It held that term limits were unconstitutional because state law could not add qualifications relating to the number of terms a candidate had previously served. The majority asserted that its view was supported by the precedent of <i>Powell v. McCormick</i> (1969), where the Court held that Congress could not exclude Adam Clayton Powell on the basis of criteria not mentioned in the qualifications clause. The majority also argued that the structure of the Constitution as a whole reflected the sovereignty of a national people, and additional qualifications would detract from national sovereignty.
<p>	Justice Thomas shredded these arguments. First, he showed as a matter of first principle that the Constitution was adopted by the people of each state and not by the people of the nation as a whole. Thus, the people of the states are prohibited from acting only if they impose such a prohibition on themselves in the Constitution or ceded such power exclusively to the federal government. This principle of residual state sovereignty is encapsulated in the Tenth Amendment: "The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people."
<p>	Thomas showed that the Tenth Amendment was expressly designed to rebut inferences like the one the majority attempted to draw from the qualifications clause. Because the Constitution simply provides a set of minimal qualifications for representatives and senators and nowhere prohibits the states from adding additional qualifications, the Tenth Amendment shows that the states are free to make additions. As Thomas wrote, "All powers that the Constitution neither delegates to the Federal Government nor prohibits to the States are controlled by the people of each state."
<p>	Once it is established that the federal government is a government of enumerated powers while the state governments are governments of residual powers, the term-limits case is easily decided. In particular, it is clear that the precedent in <i>Powell v. McCormick</i> is no bar to state term limits. Congress simply lacks an enumerated power to impose additional qualifications, whereas the states reserve the power to add additional qualifications because nowhere in the Constitution did they surrender that power. 
<p>	The opinion in <i>Thornton</i> was not Thomas's only originalist <i>tour de force</i> of the term. In <i>United States v. Lopez</i>, he wrote a concurrence that was the most interesting judicial explication of the Commerce Clause in more than half a century. In <i>Lopez</i>, the Court invalidated (as beyond Congress's power under the Commerce Clause) a federal statute that prohibited the possession of a gun within 500 feet of a school. Justice William Rehnquist's majority opinion essentially reasoned that education was not commerce and therefore held inapplicable the long line of cases in which the Court has interpreted the Commerce Clause to permit Congress to regulate any activity which has "substantial effects" on interstate commerce.
<p>	Thomas's opinion was more sweeping. He called for a reconsideration of the "substantial effects on interstate commerce" test because it was inconsistent with the original meaning of the Commerce Clause. First, Thomas showed that the modern test used a meaning of "commerce" that encompassed all economic activity, whereas the meaning of "commerce" at the time of the Framing was limited to trading and exchange, as distinct from other productive activities such as manufacturing and farming. Second, Thomas observed that permitting Congress to regulate all activities "affecting" interstate commerce deprives many of the words contained in the clause of independent force. Moreover, most of the rest of the authorities granted to Congress under Article I would also be superfluous under the "affecting commerce" test. Why give Congress particular authority to regulate bankruptcy, since insolvency self-evidently affects economic activity among the states? 
<p>	Thomas did not settle on a precise test for Congress's authority over interstate commerce, explicitly recognizing the difficulty of recovering the original meaning of the Commerce Clause in light of decades of nonoriginalist precedent. Describing the exact contours of an improved jurisprudence concerning the Commerce Clause was appropriately left to a future opinion, where that test could command a majority of the Court.
<p>	Some commentators have labeled as radical Thomas's opinions in <i>Lopez</i> and other cases this term. But these opinions are radical only in the sense of going back to the original roots of the Constitution. They are, in fact, an attempt to begin to erase the decades of radicalism during the Roosevelt and Warren Courts, which transformed the Constitution into a hollow likeness of its former self. The Constitution fashioned by those courts reflected the enthusiasm of the New Deal and the Great Society for a powerful, centralized government to act as the engine of social democracy and collectivist reforms. Accordingly, the pillars of the original Constitution, such as federalism, the separation of powers, and property rights, that seemed to be roadblocks to social democracy were weakened and, in some cases, eviscerated. Now that centralized and collectivist solutions to social problems are increasingly seen as a snare and a delusion, it is not surprising that the Constitution of the Framers -- designed to sustain only the limited, centralized government necessary to maximize the protection of individual rights -- is beginning to reappear. Thomas has become one of the leading restorers of the original canvas, stripping away in opinion after opinion the obscuring varnish that has accumulated over the last 50 years. 
<p>	Thomas also wrote a profoundly originalist concurrence in <i>McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission</i>. At issue was whether Ohio could restrict anonymous election pamphlets. The majority, in an opinion by Justice John Paul Stevens (over a dissent by Justice Antonin Scalia), invalidated such restrictions because of the value of anonymous pamphleteering to political discourse and because of the long tradition of such pamphleteering. Refusing to join the majority opinion, Thomas wrote a concurrence in which he analyzed whether the freedom of speech as understood at the time of the Framing protected the right of anonymous political speech. Reviewing an enormous amount of political discourse, he demonstrated that the Framers themselves relied on anonymity to "a remarkable extent" in their advocacy of the Constitution with only one or two pieces signed in their original name. Moreover, he unearthed an important controversy about anonymous political speech between the Federalists and the Anti-Federalists in Philadelphia in 1787. There the Federalists backed down from an attempt to prohibit anonymous speech in the face of claims that such a prohibition "reversed the important doctrine of freedom of the press." Given the pervasiveness of anonymous political speech and its triumph over legal restrictions in the years immediately preceding the adoption of the First Amendment, Thomas concluded that anonymous pamphleteering was protected by the concept of freedom of speech. 
<p>	Nor was <i>McIntyre</i> the only case in which Justice Thomas deployed originalism to protect civil liberties. In <i>Wilson v. Arkansas</i>, Justice Thomas held for a unanimous Court that the Fourth Amendment reflected the "knock and announce principle" at common law at the time of the Framing. The Fourth Amendment therefore permitted unannounced searches only in circumstances where that venerable principle permitted them -- instances when there were strong countervailing exigencies or considerations. 
	<p><i>McIntyre</i> and <i>Wilson</i> discredit the familiar claim of liberal commentators that Thomas is hostile to civil liberties. He is fearless in sustaining the liberties that the Constitution protects. Indeed, we can look forward to his sharp analysis as the Court revisits liberties such as those contained in the Contract Clause that were conveniently discarded by the "civil libertarians" of the post-New Deal era. 
<p>	Thomas was also a strong voice on matters of civil rights. His opinions in that area were less elaborate than his originalist analyses of the Constitution, but no less forceful. In the most important civil-rights case this term, <i>Adarand v. Pena</i>, in which the Court declared that strict scrutiny must apply to racial preferences in federal contracting programs, Thomas inveighed against the dissent's attempt to create "a paternalism exception to the equal protection clause." He also showed an exact understanding of law's essential possibilities and limitations: "Government cannot make us equal; it can only recognize, respect, and protect us as equal before the law."
<p>In <i>Missouri v. Jenkins</i>, Thomas also filed an important concurrence supporting the Court's holding. The decision prevented a lower court from continuing to run Missouri's schools decades after segregation had ended partly on the justification that schools still were not racially mixed. "It never ceases to amaze me," wrote Justice Thomas, "that courts are so willing to assume that anything predominantly black is inferior." Consistent with the theme of his <i>Adarand</i> concurrence, Thomas observed there is nothing constitutionally wrong with a predominantly black institution, unless it is the law that forces an institution to be composed of a particular race. <p>
	Although his voting record was among the most liberal of any justice, even liberal commentators did not single out Souter's opinions for praise. Indeed, the mark of Souter's work last term was his attempt to use process to flee substance. "The Court's process of orderly adjudication has broken down in this case," began his <i>Missouri v. Jenkins</i> dissent, and his opinion soon degenerated into a set of querulous complaints about the procedural posture of the case -- complaints easily refuted by the majority. In <i>Adarand</i>, his opinion rested largely on the proposition that the Court must uphold the program of racial set-asides because of the <i>stare decisis</i> effect of <i>Fullilove v. Klutznick</i> (1980) in which a fragmented Court upheld a different set of racial set-asides more than a decade ago, and <i>Metro Broadcasting, Inc. v. FCC</i> (1990), in which the Court upheld racial preferences in the peculiar setting of broadcasting.
<p><i>Adarand</i> illustrated the failings of Souter's performance: Far from being a critical thinker, he is a prisoner of the school of legal process jurisprudence that reigned at Harvard Law School during his time as a student there. Legal process jurisprudence arose in response to legal realism, which claimed that judges made decisions on political or other personal grounds. One important strand of process jurisprudence maintained that judges could avoid unprincipled decisionmaking by focusing on the distinctive aspects of legal procedure such as <i>stare decisis</i>. This school no longer holds sway even among academics, in part  because it is widely recognized that procedural doctrines are as subject to manipulation at least as much as the substantive doctrines of law. 
<p>	In any event, Souter's performance in <i>Adarand</i> is an unquestioning pupil's parody of his master's teachings. There was no majority opinion in <i>Fullilove</i>, thus whatever the importance of honoring <i>stare decisis</i> and preserving long settled principles, it was preposterous to put <i>Fullilove</i> in this category. Moreover, <i>Metro Broadcasting</i>'s lenient standard of review for preferences in broadcasting conflicted with much of the rest of the Court's equal-protection jurisprudence. Accordingly, the issue of racial preferences in federal contracting could not fairly be understood as governed by binding precedent. It will certainly be interesting to watch whether Souter in the future gives <i>stare decisis</i> effect to the majority opinions from which he is now dissenting.
<p><i>Rosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of the University of Virginia</i> is the case that perhaps best shows the chasm between Souter and Thomas. In that case, the majority opinion, which Justice Kennedy wrote and Thomas joined, held that the University of Virginia could not refuse to fund the printing costs of a student newspaper because of its Christian editorial content so long as it was funding the printing costs of other student publications.
<p>	The Court held that the university had discriminated against religiously inspired newspapers relative to those with a secular editorial policy, thereby engaging in viewpoint discrimination forbidden by the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. Moreover, the Court held that the university's payments to the printer who published the religious newspaper did not violate the Establishment Clause, because the payments were part of program that had a secular purpose -- fostering student learning and creativity -- and that were available to all publications, regardless of their particular religious viewpoint or lack thereof.
<p>	Souter dissented. He argued that there was no free-speech violation because there was no viewpoint discrimination: The university's decision to prohibit the reimbursement of printer expenses for magazines with a religious editorial was no different from the decision to prohibit the reimbursement of all magazines except those devoted to cooking. Souter also argued that reimbursement would violate the Establishment Clause because the state was subsidizing the propagation of a religious point of view. In support of his position, he relied on Madison's <i>Memorial and Remonstrance on Religious Observance</i> in which Madison assailed a legislative proposal that would have taxed citizens of Virginia in order to support churches. 
<p>	Like his <i>Adarand</i> opinion, Souter's <i>Rosenberger</i> opinion faithfully represents the view of the liberal establishment that educated him. Under this view, religion is something that can be practiced privately and dissected publicly at a university in history, anthropology, and psychology classes. Religion, however, must be assiduously kept from the public square, particularly when that square is an educational institution of any kind.
<p>	This principle of separation between religion and state has been sold as a way of preventing the government from favoring religion. In reality, it has a way of uniquely disfavoring religious viewpoints and maximizing the influence of the predominantly liberal secular ideas of institutions of public education. Under the conventional liberal view of the Establishment Clause, the Constitution would forbid a public university from having a program of encouraging student writing and debate that refunds the printing costs of a religious magazine even if it simultaneously funds magazines celebrating the philosophies of John Dewey, Karl Marx, and Donald Duck. 
<p>In his concurrence, Thomas first stripped this view of the patina of historical legitimacy Souter tried to give it. Thomas pointed out that the program Madison attacked in his <i>Remonstrance</i> provided special benefits to religious institutions alone: Madison complained that this forced civil society to take "cognizance" of religion. A funding program for student journalism and debate that includes religiously inspired magazines does not give special benefits to religion, but simply allows religious magazines to enjoy the same benefits as other magazines. Only a program that discriminates against religious magazines -- the very kind of program that the University of Virginia was runningtakes "cognizance" of religion. 
<p>Moreover, Thomas suggests that the conventional Establishment Clause principles are incoherent on their own terms. Tax exemptions have been provided to religious and secular institutions alike as charitable recipients for 200 years because support for charity has a secular purpose. Yet these are functionally and economically equivalent to direct aid given to religious institutions that are contributing to some secularly defined program, like encouraging intellectual debate or chastity among the young. Thomas questions how direct aid to institutions could be different from tax exemptions if both are given as part of general program that has a secular purpose and is open to secular institutions. He thereby forces us to ask: Is a deep legal principle underlying this distinction? Or is it the political calculation that, while the curtailment of direct aid might provoke grumbles from the people, the termination of tax exemptions would lead to a wholesale constitutional amendment of the Establishment Clause that the modern Court has created. 
<p>The dramatic difference in performances of Thomas and Souter suggests a few essential considerations which should guide the next conservative president in his choice of a nominee:
<p><ol>

<li>The next nominee should show an established commitment to the conservative legal movement; he should, in other words, have "reputational capital" invested in conservative legal thought. The difference between Thomas's and Souter's relation to conservative thought before they were appointed almost certainly bears on the very different paths they have followed on the Court. Thomas had not only met and conversed with the members of the conservative legal movement, but was himself one of the leaders of the movement in the area of civil rights. Thus, Thomas came to the Court inclined to articulate principles that he had been on record as supporting and, in one area, had formulated himself. 
<p>Souter, by contrast, had never made any contribution to conservative legal thought or been part of the conservative legal movement. Although he had been the attorney general under a conservative governor in New Hampshire, his legal thinking had never been systematically exposed to originalism and other conservative jurisprudential movements that gained renewed strength in the 1980s. Without any reputational capital invested in conservative legal thought, it is not surprising that Souter fell back on the jurisprudence of his legal educators and the current elite legal establishment, which is substantially to the left of the country as a whole.
<p> Another important consequence of their different associations may be a difference in psychological commitment to conservatism. In participating in the fledgling conservative movement in law, Thomas cemented many friendships through what St. Augustine called "the warmth of kindred studies." Such friendships naturally sustain the intellectual outlook previously adopted in the face of predictable pressures of the Washington establishment. Moreover, the network of friendships from the conservative movement has very practical consequences as well. Thomas has largely hired clerks who are associated with the conservative legal movement. After his first few years, Souter has hired predominantly liberal clerks, some strategically recommended by the overwhelming liberal community of law professors at leading law schools.
<p><li>Although the next nominee emphatically does not have to be a Washington insider, he should have been tested in Washington at some point in his career. Thomas's outlook was forged in the heat of one of the most contentious national issues of our time -- civil rights. He had already taken positions for which he had paid a price in public attacks on his views and his character. Souter, on the other hand, had spent the major part of his career on relatively less consequential issues far from Washington and far from the influence of the predominantly liberal national media and opinionmakers. While some of his opinions on the New Hampshire Supreme Court were vaguely conservative, they were never important enough to be challenged by the liberal legal establishment. 	
<p>	Thomas thus was tested in his beliefs in a way Souter could not have been. Once both were put in the national spotlight of the Supreme Court, it was far more certain that Thomas would be steadfast in adhering to conservative views despite an initial reception that was certain to be hostile. A justice who has not been tested, like Souter (or Justice Lewis Powell), is much more likely to be blown from side to side by the very powerful political gusts at the storm center of the Court.
<p>There are other considerations worth taking into account in choosing a justice, although they are admittedly less important than the first two:
<p><li>The justice should be persuasive with his colleagues. Although the ability of any justice, no matter how incisive and collegial, to make a difference in the way his colleague votes is limited, in a few close cases over a justice's career he or she may hope to sway others. The qualities required for persuasion are keen analytical ability (to spot possible coherent lines of analysis that a colleague might join), a persuasive pen, and a friendly, extroverted nature (to make the justice's colleagues want to be in the same corner). On the evidence of this term, Thomas has all these qualities. 
<p><li>The justice should have some understanding of economic analysis. Although this essay has addressed only constitutional law, so much of the best understanding of statutory law, both public and private, turns on economic concepts such as efficiency, consumer welfare, and cost-benefit analysis. A justice literate in economics has a substantial advantage in interpreting such statutes. Economic literacy does not necessarily entail that the nominee be a law and economics professor or have an academic degree in economics, but simply that the nominee have been exposed to systematic economic analysis during his or her career. Thomas, for instance, had taken an intensive course in economics for judges when he was appointed to the District of Columbia Circuit. 
</ol><p>	With the benefit of such considerations and the very large supply of lawyers and jurists in the conservative legal movement who would make excellent nominees, I am confident that the next president can nominate individuals who will join the pantheon of truly great Supreme Court justices: like Chief Justice John Marshall, Justice George Sutherland, Justice Scalia, and, if he continues to meet the standard he set last term, Justice Clarence Thomas himself.

	Although slavery ended in the United States more than a century ago, its legacy continues to be disputed among scholars and to underlie contemporary debates about public policy. The reason for this is that slavery is considered the classic expression of American racism, and its effects are still viewed as central to the problems faced by blacks in the United States. Slavery seems to be the wound that never healedthe moral core of the oppression story so fundamental to black identity today. No wonder that bitterness generated by recollections of slavery has turned a generation of black scholars and activists against the nation's Founding -- against identification with America itself.
<p>	"Jefferson didn't mean it when he wrote that all men are created equal," writes historian John Hope Franklin. "We've never meant it. The truth is that we're a bigoted people and always have been. We think every other country is trying to copy us now, and if they are, God help the world." He argues that, by betraying the ideals of freedom, "the Founding Fathers set the stage for every succeeding generation of Americans to apologize, compromise, and temporize on those principles."
<p>	In <i>Black Odyssey</i>, Nathan Huggins condemns the American Framers for establishing, not freedom, but "a model totalitarian society." Huggins condemns the Framers for refusing to mention the words "slave" or "slavery" in the Constitution in an effort to "sanitize their new creation" and avoid "the deforming mirror of truth." The Founding, he concludes, was simply "a bad way to start."
<p>	Speaking on the 200th anniversary of the Constitution, former Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall refused to "find the wisdom, foresight, and sense of justice exhibited by the Framers particularly profound. The government they devised was defective from the start." Marshall urged that instead of jingoistic celebration, Americans should seek an "understanding of the Constitution's defects," its immoral project to "trade moral principles for self-interest."
<p>	Is it true that the American Founding was corrupted by a base and unwarranted compromise with slavery, and that the Framers of the Constitution, many of whom were slaveowners, revealed themselves as racist hypocrites? Must we agree with the abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, who charged that the American Founding was a "covenant with death," an "agreement with hell," and a "refuge of lies," an appraisal endorsed by the great black leader Frederick Douglass? If these charges are true, then America is indeed ill-founded, blacks are right to think of themselves as alienated "Africans in America," and the hope for racial amity constructed upon the liberal democratic vision of the Founding becomes a chimera.
<p>  On the other hand, if the Framers are exonerated of the charges of racist hypocrisy, then their blueprint for America might provide a viable foundation for helping blacks and whites to transcend the pathology of race. Indeed, it is the vision of Thomas Jefferson and the Framers that provides the only secure basis for a multiracial society, in which citizens are united not by blood or lineage, but by virtue of their equality.
 <p>
<b>Of Human Bondage
</b><p>	Notwithstanding the vilification of American history by many commentators, the institution of slavery was neither peculiarly American nor peculiarly white. Not only was slavery extensively practiced in the ancient world -- Egypt, Mesopotamia, China, India, and elsewhere -- but in the modern era Africans and American Indians practiced slavery, Arabs actively promoted the slave trade, and thousands of blacks in America were slaveowners.<p>
	The practice of whites owning slaves developed in the United States in line with universal practices, including prevailing Western institutions that held millions of whites in various degrees of unfreedom. In this context, it is not hard to understand Charles Pinckney's amazement, during the debates over the American Founding, over questions about the morality of slavery. "If slavery be wrong," Pinckney erupted, "it is justified by the example of all the world."	In most parts of the world, slavery was uncontroversial for the simple reason that the concept of freedom simply did not exist. Writes African-American scholar Orlando Patterson, "There was no word for 'freedom' in most non-Western languages before contact with Western peoples."<p>
	Prior to the development of a modern Western notion of freedom, most people lived in a world shaped by what historian David Brion Davis terms "the normal network of kinship ties of dependency, protection, obligation, and privilege," a system that included various forms of patronage and servitude.
<p>	Nathan Huggins writes that slavery evolved in a social system radically different from our own, one that "regarded servants and laborers as base people," that used "hunger and the lash as a goad to productivity," that maintained discipline by means of "maiming, dismemberment . . . torture, the rack, beheading, burning at the stake, impaling." Between white laborers and black slaves, Huggins writes, "the differences were more in degree than in kind." 
<p>	Historian Oscar Handlin notes that in Europe, as in much of the world, the antithesis of the term "free" was not "slave" but "unfree," and the vast majority of people lived in servitude or partial freedom. Involuntary bondage was common. "A debtor could be sold" to pay off his debts, he writes, vagrants and vagabonds "might be bound over to the highest bidder, their labor sold for a term," and criminal offenses were routinely punished with sentences of forced public service, "sometimes for life."
<p>	Many whites became indentured servants in America; they bound themselves to a planter or company for four to seven years in return for free passage across the Atlantic and some starting-up provisions. Like English servants, bondsmen in America were frequently bought and sold, or used as gambling stakes. "Under such circumstances," writes Gordon Wood in <i>The Radicalism of the American Revolution</i>, "it was often difficult for the colonists to perceive the distinctive peculiarity of black slavery." 
<p>	Until the 18th century, few Europeans had moral qualms about slavery, which contradicted no important social value for most people around the world. In the Arab world, which was the first to import large numbers of slaves from Africa, the slave traffic was truly cosmopolitan. Slaves of every hue and origin were sold in open bazaars. The Arabs played an important role as middlemen in the trans-Atlantic slave trade, and contemporary research suggests that between the 7th and the 19th centuries they transported more than l4 million black slaves across the Sahara and the Red Seaa larger number than were shipped to the Americas.
<p>	Native American Indians practiced slavery on each other, long before Europeans arrived to practice it on them. For several tribes in the American Northwest, slaves constituted between l0 and l5 percent of the population. The Cherokee employed "slave catchers" to retrieve wounded combatants from other tribes, although the Cherokee preferred to kill enemies rather than take them captive. In some Indian tribes, slaveowners routinely killed large numbers of slaves in potlatch ceremonies to prove how wealthy they were.
<p>	Among Africans, the three powerful kingdoms of Ghana, Songhay, and Mali all relied on slave labor. Nor were these slaves exclusively blacks: The emperor Mansa Musa, for example, purchased Turkish slaves for his court in Mali. White Europeans who were shipwrecked off the west coast of Africa were also enslaved. The Ashanti of West Africa customarily enslaved all foreigners. African slavery was both widespread and uncontroversial. Historian Paul Lovejoy argues that "in the American context, slavery was introduced from the outside and always relied on the importation of slaves," while "in Africa slavery evolved from indigenous institutions."
<p>	In a recent study, John Thornton shows that slavery was far more deeply embedded in Africa than in Europe because Europeans recognized land as the primary source of private wealth, whereas "slaves were the only form of private, revenue-producing property recognized in African law." Tribal chiefs in Africa, working through Arab middlemen, sold millions of blacks to Europeans and supplied the trans-Atlantic slave trade without any fundamental modification of the institutions and values of Africa. According to Basil Davidson in <i>The African Slave Trade</i>: "The notion that Europe altogether imposed the slave trade on Africa is without any foundation in history.... Those Africans who were involved in the trade were seldom the helpless victims of a commerce they did not understand: On the contrary, they responded to its challenge. They exploited its opportunities."
<p>	Contrary to the popular belief nourished by Alex Haley's novel <i>Roots</i>, Europeans did not typically invade African tribes to chase down and capture slaves. Many slaves purchased by Europeans were already slaves in Africa. Income from the slave trade made many African chiefs and tribes rich. The grim reality of the African slave trade between Africa and America was summed up by Zora Neale Hurston, the great black writer of the Harlem Renaissance in the early part of the 20th century: "The white people held my people in slavery here in America. They had bought us, it is true, and exploited us. But the inescapable fact that stuck in my craw was: My people had sold me.... My own people had exterminated whole nations and torn families apart for a profit before the strangers got their chance at a cut. It was a sobering thought. It impressed upon me the universal nature of greed."

<b>Racism and Slavery
</b><p>

	American slavery was prompted not by racism but by the pursuit of profit. There was work to be done building the New World, and slavery provided the unpaid labor to do the job. Scholars are fairly unanimous that African slaves were purchased and transported to America for reasons of convenience and economic gain. How, then, did American slavery assume a distinctively racial character?
<p>	Marxist scholars have a powerful answer. "Race relations did not determine the patterns of slavery in the new world," writes historian Eugene Genovese, "the patterns of slavery...determined race relations." The Marxist view is that racism developed and spread in America as an ideology to rationalize the enslavement and exploitation of blacks by a white master class. Fortified by racism from the beginning, American slavery itself fostered and institutionalized bigotry.
<p>	This view draws on the insight that C.R. Boxer popularized: "One race cannot systematically enslave members of another for centuries without acquiring a conscious or unconscious feeling of racial superiority." That is why, in many ancient cultures, it was customary to brand or tattoo slaves to confirm their social stigma. But in the United States no such measures were necessary. Africans were chosen for slavery in part because they were considered inferior as a race. They already wore a racial uniform, which itself became the mark of slavery, and even later a stigma of shame and inferiority. 
<p>	The Marxist view contains a good deal of truth. Even though not all blacks in America were slaves, and not all slaves in America were black, over time these nuances became blurred, and in crucial respects racism and slavery became synonymous, in perception if not in operation. The consequence was a virtually inseparable association in the American mind between the degradation of slavery and the degradation of blackness. Yet the Marxist account does not explain what economically exploitative purpose racism serves by tormenting the free black population.
<P>

	This question is illuminated by considering the differences between slavery in the United States and slavery in Latin America. Scholars who study Caribbean and South American slavery agree that the system was extremely harsh, in some respects harsher than in the United States. Reporting to absentee owners in Spain and Portugal, ruthless overseers wielded the lash over gigantic plantations of Africans, working them with little apparent concern for their health or longevity. The slave mortality rate was far higher in Latin America than in the United States.
<P>	Yet partly through the influence of the Catholic Church, Latin American slave laws were far more benign than those in the United States. Nowhere in the United States was marriage legal for slaves, whereas slaves in Latin America had a legal right to marry and receive the sacraments. Because of the church's emphasis on family unity, slave families in Latin America had specific rights, including legal protections against arbitrary dissolution.
<p>	By contrast, slaveowners in the United States had full discretion over whether to break up families and separately sell parents and children. Every American slave state except South Carolina had laws against miscegenation. In Latin America, because of the small number of white women who settled in the Spanish colonies, black concubinage was everywhere legal, public, even moderately respectable. In fact, according to Stanley Elkins, miscegenation was generally considered a good thing in Latin America because it had a whitening effect, whereas it was generally considered a bad thing in the United States because it had a darkening effect.
<p>	Manumissions were easier, both as a matter of law and practice, in Latin America. Some American states severely restricted the right of masters to free their slaves, fearing the presence of a resentful class of free blacks among the white population.
<p>	The consequence of the Latin American system was the gradual emergence of a free colored class, which was considered neither white nor black, but named for the specific proportion of white and black and Indian blood. It was common throughout Latin America for masters to free their offspring by slave women. In the United States, by contrast, the progeny of master and slave usually remained slaves. Thus the United States gradually embraced a doctrine unique in the history of slavery: All children with any recognizable black ancestry would be considered black. To be white meant, <i>de jure</i> if not <i>de facto</i>, to be a thoroughbred European, uncontaminated by a single drop of Negro blood. Even after slavery, the one-drop rule would ensure that blacks, as a group, would remain distinct and distant from whites who could think of themselves as a ruling class.
<p>	None of this means that no enduring hierarchy developed in Latin America. It did, but it was primarily a social and not a racial hierarchy. The colored class emerged as a buffer zone, an intermediary between pure whites and pure blacks; in many countries, the colored class became the national majority. Dark skin continued to carry some stigma, but it was entirely possible to erase this through wealth, political status, and intermarriage with others of lighter skin. Racial tensions persist today in Brazil, Cuba, and other Latin American countries, but the racial legacy of slavery there is unquestionably more benign than in the United States. 
<p>	Scholars have struggled to explain why the slave systems in North America and South America evolved so differently. No doubt many factors are responsible, including religious and cultural differences. But an often-overlooked cause lies in the radically different systems of government. Spain and Portugal, which maintained South American colonies, were rigid monarchies. From the seat of government to the church, presided over by the Holy Inquisition, freedom defined as the rights of self-government and individual self-determination simply did not exist. Consequently, Spanish and Portuguese plantation owners did not have to explain to anyone, even to themselves, why they were enslaving large numbers of Africans, depriving them of liberty, and stealing the fruits of their labor. Slavery was a practice that seemed entirely reasonable for social and economic life, and one that did not contradict any of the institutions in their home countries. In short, South American slaveowners were under very little obligation to justify or rationalize slavery.
<p>	By contrast, the United States in the late 18th century became a free society with a liberal democratic creed. Inspired by the words of a Southern slaveholder, Thomas Jefferson, Americans fought a revolution in order to secure the proposition that all men are "created equal" and "endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights." Historian Duncan MacLeod writes that "the very term slavery was among the most frequent in the Revolutionary vocabulary. The war was seen as essentially a battle against political servitude." It is not easy for a society revolting in the name of liberty and equality to justify slavery. The British Tory Samuel Johnson summarized the dilemma: "How is it that we hear the loudest yelps for liberty among the drivers of Negroes?"
<p>	Many Americans found a way to resolve the contradiction. All men are created equal, blacks are being bought and sold in America, therefore blacks must not be men. After all, if blacks are men, and all men are created equal, then blacks are entitled to the same rights as whites, including the right not to be held in captivity. In order to sustain slavery, therefore, the premise of black humanity must be denied. This explains the contorted logic of the infamous <i>Dred Scott</i> decision of l857 in which the Supreme Court invoked black inferiority to exclude slaves from constitutional protection, and pronounced slave ownership as a fundamental property right.
<p>	The doctrine that slaves were legally equivalent to property generated both legal and human contradictions. In fact, slave laws implicitly recognized the humanity of slaves by holding them accountable for their actions. Nathan Huggins writes, "A pig in the corn was not a thief; a slave in the smokehouse was. A horse that trampled the life from a cruel master was no murderer; a slave who struck out against brutality was."
<p>	So the Marxist argument is essentially correct: The ideology of racial superiority, which originated to explain civilizational differences, became consolidated in America as a convenient rationalization for continuing oppression. What some Marxist scholars seem to miss is that racism in America was not an economic but a moral justification. Although they limited the franchise to propertied white males, the American Founders were not insincere in proclaiming their allegiance to principles of liberty and equality. Southerners who were in the forefront of the American Revolution, and no less committed than Northerners to the principles of the Declaration and the Constitution, found themselves in a particular quandary as they administered their forced-labor plantations. Racism in the American South served to rationalize and justify behavior that flatly contravened the nation's political ideals.
<p>	If Americans did not believe in equality, then racism would serve no ideological or material purpose. Racism, therefore, flourished in the gap between the principles of the constitution and its pragmatic concessions. Far from being proof of distinctive American evil, racism is a peculiar reflection of the moral conscience of America, and of the West. It reflects the oppressor's need to account for the betrayal of his highest ideals. Despite the ignominious pedigree of racism as a justification for exploitation, in all of human history only the white man has felt compelled to provide such a justification. Paradoxically, those who indulged in racism thereby revealed their humanity, even as they disregarded the humanity of others. The very existence of racism implies that, from the very outset, slavery existed uncomfortably and anomalously with Jeffersonian principles.
<p>
<b>Who Killed Slavery?
</b><p>	Although slavery was a universal institution, not confined to the West, what is distinctively Western is the abolition of slavery. Many people have, of course, resisted being captured and sold as slaves, but no society, including all of Africa, has ever on its own account mounted principled opposition to human servitude. In all the literature condemning Western slavery, however, few scholars have asked why a practice sanctioned by virtually all people for thousands of years should be questioned, and eventually halted, by only one.
<p>	Paradoxically, it is in America and nowhere else in the world where the legacy of slavery is a contemporary issue, the American Constitution is condemned as a document that compromised with slavery, and the Framers are routinely denounced for being racist hypocrites. The irony is compounded by the recognition that the prevailing view of the Constitution as proslavery was precisely that of Justice Taney in the <i>Dred Scott</i> decision. By contrast, Abraham Lincoln strongly denied Taney's view, and his position came to be enthusiastically embraced by Frederick Douglass, the greatest black leader of the 19th century. It is to the debates over the legitimacy of slavery in the West that we must turn to decide whether Taney and many 20th-century scholars are right, or Lincoln is.<p>
	Throughout world history, slavery had few defenders for the simple reason that it had few critics. The institution was uncontroversial, and that which is established and taken for granted does not have to be justified. The American South was unique among slave societies in history in that it produced a comprehensive proslavery ideology. In part, this was because slavery was under assault to a degree unrivaled anywhere else in the world. <p>
	The simplest defense for slavery was economic necessity: Someone has to do the dirty work, and better them than us. This position was based on an implicit premise that whites in the South were in a position to compel blacks to perform menial but necessary tasks. It is force, rather than right, that kept the system of slavery in place.
<p>	Southerners were also familiar with a European tradition, going back to the Crusades, that held it was permissible to enslave pagans but not Christians. In response to this, the leading forces in the South formulated an identical justification: Africans were heathens, so slavery would serve as a kind of moral education to introduce them to Christianity. But once slaves embraced the Christian faith of their masters, other excuses became necessary in order to justify keeping them in servitude. Here many Southern divines intervened to offer a racist rationale. They promulgated a dubious interpretation of a story in the book of Genesis in which Noah curses the descendants of his son Ham, who impudently looked upon his father's nakedness. Thus, in this account, the children of Ham were condemned to blackness and future enslavement. For a long time there was little challenge to this absurd innovation in biblical exegesis.
<p>	It was only when the institution of slavery came under moral assault for betraying the Declaration of Independence and Christian charity that many Southern apologists such as John C. Calhoun, James Henry Hammond, Edmund Ruffin, George Frederick Holmes, and George Fitzhugh responded by formulating an audacious defense of slavery as a positive good. Hammond, among others, repudiated the Jeffersonian doctrine of equality as "ridiculously absurd."
<p>	Their case for slavery depended on a paternalistic worldview in which Negroes, like women and children, occupied positions in an organic society commensurate with supposed limited moral and intellectual abilities. Eugene Genovese writes in <i>The Slaveholders' Dilemma</i>, "Southerners from social theorists to divines to politicians to ordinary slaveholders and yeomen insisted fiercely that emancipation would cast blacks into a marketplace in which they could not compete and would condemn them to the fate of the Indians or worse." Although defenders of slavery were right about the harshness of Northern capitalism, their paternalistic vision foundered in that the community of interests that could generally be presumed between husband and wife, or between parents and children, could not be presumed between master and slave.
<p>	The Southern doctrine of Negro inferiority immediately extended to whites, even those who were destitute and ignorant, membership in an exclusive racial club and a social position above that of all blacks, both slave and free. Edmund Morgan argues in <i>American Slavery, American Freedom</i> that the racial defense of Southern slavery strengthened, among whites, the conviction that, despite conspicuous differences of wealth and position, they were equal just as the Declaration of Independence posited. Racism, in other words, became a source of white social status.
<p>	The dilemma over slavery ultimately came down to one of the oldest Western arguments, which we find in Plato's <i>Republic</i>: The wise should rule over the unwise. During the Lincoln-Douglas debates, Stephen Douglas defended the right of states to decide for themselves whether they wanted slavery in precisely these terms:
<p><blockquote>	"The civilized world has always held that when any race of men have shown themselves to be so degraded by ignorance, superstition, cruelty, and barbarism, as to be utterly incapable of governing themselves, they must, in the nature of things, be governed by others, by such laws as are deemed to be applicable to their condition."
</blockquote><p> 
<b>Wisdom and Consent
</b>

<p>	We may think Stephen Douglas's view to be crude and hateful, but Abraham Lincoln did not. He agreed with Douglas: It is absurd to construct a regime in which the wise do not rule; surely no one wants the mediocre or the foolish to rule. In fact this raises a problem with democracy that the American Founders and Lincoln recognized: How can the wise, who are by definition the few, be reliably identified and chosen to rule by the many? Representative government is based on the hope that the majority will exercise their power on behalf of right, that they will choose others who are wiser than themselves to govern. Yet modern democracy introduces a crucial qualification to the claim of the wise to rule: Such rule is only legitimate when it is vindicated by popular consent. The majority is not the best judge of what is wise, but most people do recognize their own interests. Hence representative democracy is a "mixed regime," which seeks to reconcile the claims of right and expediency.
<p>	This debate is the crucial backdrop to an examination of the antislavery movement of the 18th century, because it provided the context and the moral terms for the issue. The two principles that would form the basis for the first serious challenge to the institution of slavery and the doctrine of black inferiority are both encapsulated in the Declaration of Independence: the Christian belief that all persons bear the image of God and are equal in His eyes, and the distinctly modern European political conception that all human beings enjoy a natural right to freedom and self-government that can only be abridged by their consent. 
<p>	In the second half of the 18th century, a small but militant group of religious and political activists began to apply the doctrine of equality more broadly and concretely in order to reform the injustices of this world, what David Brion Davis terms "a sacralization of social progress." Tocqueville wrote: "We have seen something absolutely without precedent in history -- servitude abolished, not by the desperate effort of the slave, but by the enlightened will of the master. . . . It is we who have given a definite and practical meaning to the Christian idea that all men are born equal, and applied it to the realities of this world."
<p>	The first group to mount an organized campaign against slavery was the Society of Friends, the Quakers, first in Europe in the second half of the 17th century, then in the United States. Ignoring passages in the Bible that had been invoked to justify slavery, leading Quakers such as George Fox in England and John Woolman and Anthony Benezet in the U.S. emphasized that spiritual freedom -- man's capacity to choose the good in his quest for moral perfectibility -- required freedom of choice in this life. Slavery, according to this view, represented the moral imprisonment of God's children and thus was wrong, even blasphemous. Drawing on the religious energies of the Great Awakening, the first of a serious of revival movements that would energize America between the mid-18th century and the end of the 19th, many evangelical Protestants began to embrace a similar interpretation. They applied Christ's injunction -- do unto others as we would have them do unto us -- directly to the relationship between slaveowners and slaves.<p>
	In l772, Lord Mansfield issued a landmark decision in Britain abolishing slavery on English soil. In l833, thanks to the abolition campaign of Granville Sharp, Thomas Clarkson, and especially William Wilberforce, slavery was outlawed throughout the British empire. Economic motives undoubtedly contributed, but scholars now generally agree that religious and political principles were indispensable in achieving the abolition of servitude. Antislavery victories soon spread to France, which forbade slavery in its territories in l848, and to other European nations as well. In a bizarre development, tribal leaders in Gambia, Congo, Dahomey, and other African nations that had prospered under the slave trade sent delegations to London and Paris to vigorously protest the abolition of slavery. "Africans felt that the rules of their traditional life had been called into question," Mohamed Mbodj writes, "by initiatives which destabilized the bases of their society." <p>
	Eventually the British example, backed by diplomatic and even military measures, eradicated slavery in all foreign areas of influence. In America, although there were many among them who shared prevailing prejudices against blacks, the abolitionist movement contained the first antiracists. Leading abolitionists agreed that blacks were civilizationally inferior and incapable of ruling themselves. But black inferiority, they said, is no justification for slavery; rather, it is the product of slavery itself. Some abolitionists endorsed the idea of helping blacks to resettle in Africa, but those who recognized the implausibility of such schemes attempted to show that blacks were capable of living as free people. In order to directly rebut the Southern argument that blacks were better off being ruled by their betters, abolitionists began a slow but relentless quest for intelligent blacks who would be standing refutations of theories of intrinsic inferiority.<p>
	Three prime exhibits for opponents of slavery to demonstrate the intellectual capacity of Negroes were Phillis Wheatley, the Negro poet; Benjamin Banneker, the black mathematician and scholar; and Frederick Douglass, the runaway slave and later statesman and orator. For many Americans, it was so unbelievable that a black person could produce a serious work of literature that 18 eminent whites (including John Hancock, who signed the Declaration of Independence, and Thomas Hutchinson, the governor of Massachusetts) offered an "attestation to the publick" that, upon examination, Wheatley's poems were verified to be her original work and that she was indeed a full-blooded black woman. Additionally, abolitionists stressed the physical and mental sufferings of slaves in order to recruit humanitarian sentiment on behalf of emancipation. No one was more successful in this than Harriet Beecher Stowe, author of <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>, published in l852. Perhaps the most influential political tract of the 19th century, Stowe's sentimental novel was credited by Lincoln for turning the North irrevocably against slavery, setting the stage for the confrontation that culminated in the Civil War.

<b>Wolf by the Ears
</b>

<p><blockquote>The only distinction between freedom and slavery is this: In the former state, a man is governed by the laws to which he has given his consent; in the latter, he is governed by the will of another.
</blockquote><p>

 -- Alexander Hamilton
<p>
	Justice Taney's argument in <i>Dred Scott</i>, shared by many contemporary scholars, that the American Founders were hypocrites who produced a proslavery regime, rests on the apparent contradiction between stated ideals and actual practice. It seems hard to explain how a slaveowner like Thomas Jefferson could declare that "all men are created equal." Nor is it obvious how 55 men in Philadelphia, some 30 of whom were slaveowners themselves, could proclaim antislavery principles while endorsing a document that would permit slavery to continue in the Southern states. This is the force behind Taney's insistence that these men could not have meant what they said. Taney's interpretation, that the Constitution secures no rights for blacks that whites must respect, leads directly to the contemporary suggestion that the Founders were motivated not by noble ideals but by crass self-interest.<p>
	That the American Founders were self-interested is impossible to deny. Thomas Jefferson owned some 200 slaves and did not free them. Yet the case of Jefferson is revealing. Far from rationalizing plantation life by adopting the usual Southern arguments about the happy slave, Jefferson the Virginian vehemently denounced slavery as flatly inconsistent with justice. Jefferson recognized that blacks were not slaves "by nature," only by convention. Although he agreed with the scientific view of his time, and suspected that blacks were inferior to whites in capacity, Jefferson expressed his wish that black accomplishment prove him wrong. (Jefferson's empirical observations about black inferiority were not shared by either Benjamin Franklin or Alexander Hamilton.) Moreover, Jefferson strongly denied that possible black intellectual or civilizational inferiority justified white enslavement: "Whatever be their talents, it is no measure of their rights." Consequently, the only rationale for Jefferson not freeing his slaves is expediency. "Justice is in one scale, and self-preservation in another."<p>
	The dilemma of Jefferson and the American Founders may be summarized as follows: They fully recognized that a democratic society depends not just on wisdom, but also on consent. Consequently, there is no justification whatever for ruling another human being without his consent. Blacks are human beings, and in possession of natural rights. Slavery is therefore against natural right and should be prohibited. But how? Here Jefferson and the Founders faced two profound obstacles. The first was that virtually all of them recognized the degraded condition of blacks in America. Whatever the cause of this condition, the Framers recognized that it posed a formidable hurdle to granting to blacks the rights of citizenship. By contrast with monarchy and aristocracy, which only require subjects to obey, self-government requires citizens who have the moral and civilizational capacity to be rulers. 
<p>	Jefferson also recognized the existence of intense and widespread white prejudices against blacks that seemed to prevent the two peoples from coexisting harmoniously on the same soil. While Jefferson agonized over the problem, Madison proposed a strange but bold scheme for solving the nation's multiracial dilemma of the time. The government, he suggested, might take the land it had acquired from the Indians, sell it to the new European immigrants, and use the money to send blacks back to Africa. The concept of relocating blacks in Africa was later endorsed in principle by Lincoln and retained its appeal among many whites and some blacks until the Civil War.
<p>	The deference of Jefferson and the American Founders to popular prejudices strikes many contemporary scholars as excessive. Some suggest that popular convictions simply represented a frustrating obstacle that the Founders should have dealt with resolutely and forcefully. In a democratic society, however, the absence of the people's agreement on a fundamental moral question of governance is no mere technicality. The case for democracy, no less than the case against slavery, rests on the legitimacy of the people's consent. To outlaw slavery without the consent of the majority of whites would be to destroy democracy, and thus to destroy the very basis for outlawing slavery.
<p>	The men gathered in Philadelphia faced a genuine dilemma. For them to sanction slavery would be to proclaim the illegitimacy of the American Revolution and the new form of government based on the people's consent; yet for them to outlaw slavery without securing the people's consent would have the same effect. In practical terms as well, the choice facing the men gathered in Philadelphia was not to permit or to prohibit slavery. Rather, the choice was either to establish a union in which slavery was tolerated, or not to have a union. Any suggestion that Southern states could be persuaded to join a union and give up slavery can be dismissed as implausible in the extreme.
<p>	Thus the accusation that the Founders compromised on the Declaration's principle "all men are created equal" for the purpose of expediency reflects a grave misunderstanding. The Founders were confronted with a competing principle, also present in the Declaration, that governments derive their legitimacy "from the consent of the governed." Both principles must be satisfied, and where they cannot, compromise is not merely permissible but morally required. 
<p>	The American Founders found a middle ground not between principle and practice, but between antislavery and majority consent. Not only are these closely related principles, but in a philosophic sense, they are the same principle. How did the Framers seek to mediate between their rival claims? By producing a Constitution in which the concept of slavery is tolerated, in deference to consent, but nowhere given any moral approval, in recognition of the slave's natural rights. Indeed nowhere in the document is the term "slavery" used. Slaves are always described as "persons," implying their possession of natural rights. The Founders made concessions to slavery as a matter of fact but not as a matter of right. In addition, the Framers produced a Constitution that nowhere acknowledges the existence of racial distinctions, thus producing a document that transcended its time and provided a charter for a better future.
<p>	None of the supposed contradictions that contemporary scholars have located in the American Founders were unrecognized by them. Many of the Framers justified their toleration for slavery on prudential grounds: In the 1770s and 1780s, they had reason to believe that slavery was losing its commercial appeal. In this they were wrong. Eli Whitney's invention of the cotton gin in l793 (which the Founders could not possibly have anticipated) revived the demand for slavery in the South. Even so, the test of the Founders' project is the practical question: Did the American Founding strengthen or weaken the institution of slavery? 
<p>	The intellectual and moral ferment that produced the American Revolution, Gordon Wood argues, should be judged by its consequences. Before l776, slavery was legal in every state in America. Yet by l804, every state north of Maryland had abolished slavery, either immediately or gradually; Southern and border states prohibited further slave importations from abroad; and Congress outlawed the slave trade as soon as it was allowed to, in l808. Slavery was no longer a national but a sectional institution, and one under moral and political siege. "Before the revolution, Americans like every other people took slavery for granted," Wood says. "But slavery came under indictment as a result of the same principles that produced the American Founding. In this sense, the prospect of the Civil War is implicitly contained in the Declaration of Independence."
<p>	Abraham Lincoln was one of the most astute students of the American Founding in his time or since. He not only perceived the Framers' dilemma, but knew that he inherited it. The principle of majority rule is based on Jefferson's doctrine that "all men are created equal," yet what Harry Jaffa terms the "crisis of the house divided" arises when the majority denies that "all men are created equal" -- that is, denies the basis of its own legitimacy. Lincoln was presented with two concrete options: working to overthrow democracy, or working to secure consent through persuasion.
<p>	Conscious that he, too, must defer, as the Founders did, to prevailing prejudices, Lincoln nevertheless sought to neutralize those prejudices so they did not become a barrier to securing black freedom. In a series of artfully conditional claims about blacks -- "If God gave him little, that little let him enjoy" -- Lincoln paid ritual obeisance to existing racism while drawing even racists into his coalition to end slavery. Lincoln made these rhetorical concessions because he knew that the possibility for securing antislavery consent had improved since the 1780s.<p>
	In one of the clearest commentaries on the Declaration, Lincoln observed: "They intended to include all men, but they did not intend to declare all men equal in all respects. They did not mean to say all were equal in color, size, intellect, moral developments, or social capacity. They defined with tolerable distinctness in what respects they did consider all men created equalequal in certain inalienable rights. They did not mean to assert the obvious untruth, that all were then actually enjoying that equality, nor yet, that they were about to confer it immediately upon them. . . . They meant simply to declare the <i>right</i>, so that the <i>enforcement</i> of it might follow as fast as circumstances should permit."
<p>	By working through rather than around the democratic process, Lincoln justified the nation's faith in the untried experiment of representative self-government. In vindicating the slave's right to rule himself, Lincoln also vindicated the legitimacy of democratic self-rule. And Lincoln's position came to be shared by Frederick Douglass, who once denounced the Constitution but who eventually came to the conclusion that it contained antislavery principles: "Abolish slavery tomorrow, and not a sentence or syllable of the Constitution need be altered." Slavery, he concluded, was simply a "scaffolding to the magnificent structure, to be removed as soon as the building is completed." 
<p>	It took a civil war to destroy slavery, and with it much of the infrastructure and economy of the South, between l860 and l865. More than a half million whites died in that war, "one life for every six slaves freed," C. Vann Woodward reminds us. Although the question of slavery in the United States was ultimately resolved by force, Lincoln and Douglass both believed the triumph of the union and the emancipation of the slaves represented not the victory of might over right, but the reverse: Justice had won over expediency and the principles of the American Founding had at long last prevailed.
<p>
<b>The Price of Freedom
</b>

<p>	Whatever its functional relevance in a world utterly different from our own, slavery was a moral crime. People should not own other people. Unfortunately the practice of slavery persisted into the 20th century in many parts of Asia, Africa, and the Middle East: Saudi Arabia and Yemen outlawed it only in l962. According to the British Anti-Slavery International, which monitors the institution worldwide, it is still practiced covertly in Southeast Asia, Latin America, and the Arab world. In Mauritania alone, nearly l00,000 people are estimated to be enslaved.
<p>	The abolition of slavery in the West did not produce the abolition of racism. As George Fredrickson puts it, "The slaveholding mentality . . . remained the wellspring of white supremacist thought and action long after the institution that originally sustained it had been relegated to the dustbin of history." At the same time, abolition constitutes one of the greatest moral achievements of Western civilization. The reason for the acceptability of slavery prior to the 18th century is that the idea of freedom simply did not exist in an applied and comprehensive sense anywhere in the world.
<P>	It is understandable that American blacks, on discovering the circumstances in which their ancestors were brought to this country, would feel at best a qualified patriotism. But upon reflection this ambivalence may be unwarranted. Africans were not uniquely unfortunate to be taken as slaves; their descendants were uniquely fortunate to be born in the only civilization in the world to abolish slavery on its own initiative. For Zora Neale Hurston, the black feminist writer of the Harlem Renaissance, the legacy of slavery is one of opportunities for the future, not unceasing submersion in the past.
<p>	"From what I can learn, it was sad," she wrote. "Certainly. But my ancestors who lived and died in it are dead. The white men who profited by their labor and lives are dead also. I have no personal memory of those times, and no responsibility for them. Neither has the grandson of the man who held my folks. . . . I have no intention of wasting my time beating on old graves. . . . I do not belong to the sobbing school of Negroes who hold that nature somehow has given them a low-down dirty deal and whose feelings are all hurt about it. . . . Slavery is the price I paid for civilization, and that is worth all that I have paid through my ancestors for it."
	<p>A similar position was elaborated by Booker T. Washington, who was born a slave but went on to become the most powerful black statesman and educator in the United States: "Think about it: We went into slavery pagans; we came out Christians. We went into slavery pieces of property; we came out American citizens. We went into slavery with chains clanking about our wrists; we came out with the American ballot in our hands. . . . Notwithstanding the cruelty and moral wrong of slavery, we are in a stronger and more hopeful condition, materially, intellectually, morally, and religiously, than is true of an equal number of black people in any other portion of the globe."
<p>	Washington's argument is that slavery proved to be the transmission belt that nevertheless brought Africans into the orbit of modern civilization and Western freedom, so that future generations of black Americans would be far more free and prosperous than their former kinsmen in Africa. Washington's conclusion seems hard to deny: Slavery was an institution that was terrible to endure for slaves, but it left the <i>descendants</i> of slaves better off in America. For this, the American Founders are owed a measure of respect and gratitude.

<h3>A Commentary on the Podhoretz Legacy</h3>

<hr size=3 width=50%>

<b>Mark Gerson</b><br>

<b>Policy Review</b><br>

<i>Fall 1995, Number 74</I></center>

<p>

	In the early 1960s, the great Columbia professor and literary critic Lionel Trilling warned of the impending "Norman Invasion." He was talking about three brash and brilliant young stars of the literary worldNorman O. Brown, Norman Mailer, and Norman Podhoretz. A generation later, no one recalls Norman O. Brown, and Norman Mailer will be remembered as an unharnessed genius. Of Trilling's invaders, one has conquered: Norman Podhoretz.
<p>	 William, the great Norman conqueror of 1066, left behind the glorious Bayeux Tapestry detailing the story of his invasion of England. Despite two world wars and countless smaller ones, the tapestry remains with us. Norman Podhoretz has left us not a tapestry, but 412 issues of <i>Commentary</i>, which <i>The Economist</i> once called "the best magazine in the world." Podhoretz served as its editor in chief from February 1960 until May of this year. These were the years and this was the magazine in which neoconservatism -- one of the most important political movements of this century -- was conceived, developed, and eventually blossomed.
<p>	What hath Norman Podhoretz wrought? Three extraordinary contributions to our intellectual culture stand out. First, Podhoretz and his <i>Commentary</i> writers were the intellectual force behind Ronald Reagan's Cold War battles. Their ideas, harnessed by a gifted statesman and backed by a strong and capable military, helped bring about the collapse of the Soviet Union and the intellectual delegitimation of Third World and anti-Zionist politics.<p>
	Another legacy of <i>Commentary</i> is evident in today's debate over affirmative action. Podhoretz and his writers, strong supporters of the civil-rights movement in the 1960s, have maintained a steadfast opposition to racial classifications or preferences throughout their careers. When the honorable movement of Martin Luther King Jr. veered into a realm of quotas, racial preferences, and social engineering, Podhoretz stood firm. <i>Commentary</i> authors identified the grave moral weaknesses of affirmative action before anyone else, warning that quotas betrayed the promise of civil rights and victimized their intended beneficiaries. Present-day opponents of quotas often sound like they are quoting from Commentary articles written two decades ago.
<p>	The same can be said about discussions regarding what Lionel Trilling called the "adversary culture" -- opponents of middle-class values whose influence spreads far beyond the college campuses where the critics flourish. While many Americans once tolerated these people, praising their "idealism," Podhoretz and the neoconservatives saw them as destructive, nihilistic, and ultimately dangerous. Rare for intellectuals, the neoconservatives celebrated the prosaic and unromantic culture of the ordinary American. In so doing, they provided bourgeois culture with the intellectual self-confidence to stand up against those whom most now recognize as cultural barbarians.
<p>
<b>Beginnings</b><p>
	Born in 1930, Podhoretz was raised in a lapsed Orthodox Jewish home in Brooklyn, New York. After graduating from high school, he enrolled at Columbia University. There he became the protg of Lionel Trilling and distinguished himself as one of the brightest literary minds of his generation. After graduate studies at Cambridge University, Podhoretz served for two years in the United States Army before returning home to assume a position as an assistant editor of <i>Commentary</i> -- a job that Trilling had arranged for him. While at <i>Commentary</i>, Podhoretz wrote prolifically, publishing in nearly every New York magazine of note. In present-day discussions of neoconservatism, it is often said that Podhoretz (and the other neoconservatives) are refugees from the Left who, in reaction to the 1960s counterculture, moved rightward. Although Podhoretz was a liberal in that he supported the New Deal and civil rights, his work in the 1950s demonstrates how that observation reveals far more about changes in liberalism than changes in Podhoretz.
<p>	While the topics of Podhoretz's essays in the 1950s ranged from William Faulkner to nuclear war, they reveal the skepticism of a serious critic inclined to doubt any simple answers to social, political, and literary questions. Rejecting the rationalist and utopian themes of liberalism, Podhoretz had a great appreciation for the commonplace and the prosaic. In a 1957 essay, Podhoretz indicted liberalism for being unable to "take a sufficiently complicated view of reality." Liberalism was "a conglomeration of attitudes suitable only to the naive, the callow, the rash: in short, the immature. Its view of the world was seen to be an undignified, indeed dangerous philosophy for the leading nation in the West to entertain."
<p>	In "The Know-Nothing Bohemians," a seminal 1958 essay in <i>Partisan Review</i>, Podhoretz focused his attack on what he regarded as an exceptionally naive, callow, and immature group of leftists -- the Beats, a group of literary intellectuals centered in Greenwich Village who were attaining increasing prominence in American letters. Podhoretz charged that the Beats' disdain for traditional, middle-class morality translated into a dangerous nihilism, "the revolution of the spiritually underprivileged and the crippled of soul -- young men who can't think straight and so hate anyone who can." For Podhoretz, the message of their animosity toward private property and the middle class was clear: "Kill the intellectuals who can talk coherently, kill the people who can sit still for five minutes at a time, kill those incomprehensible characters who are capable of getting seriously involved with a woman, a job, a cause."
<p>
<b>The Implosion of Liberalism
</b><p>

	In 1959, Podhoretz was named the editor in chief of <i>Commentary</i>, but he did not take up arms against the nihilists right away. In keeping with the zeitgeist of the times, he flirted with the Left. He opened the pages of <i>Commentary</i> to writers supporting the peace movement and radical cultural critics like Paul Goodman, who wrote of the "beautiful cultural consequences" that would follow from legalizing pornography. Podhoretz upset many people with his movement toward the Left -- namely Lionel Trilling and Irving Kristol -- but maintained his connections to the traditional liberal community as well.
<p>	The Vietnam War proved a pivotal event in the development of Podhoretz's thought, but not in the way it would for so many others of his generation. Podhoretz opposed military intervention in Vietnam, and under his stewardship, <i>Commentary</i> was the first magazine to seriously consider the war and its potential ramifications. His opposition was always on tactical grounds; he maintained simply that it was a conflict from which the United States could not emerge victorious. To Podhoretz, this one error of the United States did not change the fact that communism and the Soviet Union were evil, and did not suggest any fundamental flaws in the American way of life. The Left and the counterculture, on the other hand, used the war to impugn American institutions like the family and the university.
<p>	So while Podhoretz opposed the war, his opposition to the antiwar movement was more intense and ultimately more important. His position was barely represented in the intellectual community. He saw liberal intellectuals, colleagues whom he respected and trusted, fail to criticize increasingly militant student protesters. Whatever the students did -- even when radicals at Columbia urinated on the carpet in the office of university president Grayson Kirk -- liberal professors praised the "idealism" of the students and excused their tactics as the excesses of youthful exuberance. Podhoretz's wife, the noted writer Midge Decter, recalls the student takeover at Columbia University. She was at a party of New York intellectuals, and criticized the students who had overturned files and destroyed a professor's life's work. Dwight MacDonald, a major figure on the New York intellectual scene for 25 years, responded, "Obviously, you care more about material values than human values."<p>
	This incident was emblematic of what Podhoretz, Decter, and their allies identified as a major crisis in liberalism. Though the term "neoconservatism" was not coined until the early 1970s -- by the socialist Michael Harrington -- it is used now to describe the New York intellectuals and their compatriots who opposed the counterculture and its various permutations. What Podhoretz had called in 1957 "a conglomeration of attitudes suitable only to the naive, the callow, the rash" imploded 10 years later. Unable or unwilling to define and protect its principles against the radical onslaught, liberalism self-destructed as a coherent, governing philosophy -- with devastating effects on its key institutional expressions: the university and the government. Though he was not yet a conservative, Podhoretz became as effective a critic of the Left as anyone on the Right. Many arguments that we now regard as staples of conservatism originated in the pages of <i>Commentary</i> 20 years ago. An example is political correctness: Though the term was not coined until the 1980s, it was best described in a 1973 <i>Commentary</i> article called "The New Inquisitors," written by Podhoretz himself:
<p><blockquote>

	"The upshot is an atmosphere which is no longer conducive to fearless inquiry or even to playful speculation and which, far from encouraging, positively obstructs the development of independence of mind and of the critical spirit. Thus do our colleges and universities continue their degenerative mutation from sanctuaries for free discussion into inquisitorial agents of a dogmatic secular faith."
</blockquote><p>

	Though Podhoretz and several others -- especially James Q. Wilson, whose 1972 <i>Commentary</i> article, "Liberalism Versus Liberal Education," explains perfectly the crisis in higher education today -- tried to protect the university, they saw that their task was virtually hopeless. The university was liberalism's home turf, and was the first casualty of the liberal implosion. The issue to which Norman Podhoretz and <i>Commentary</i> dedicated most of their ideological firepower was the legacy of the civil rights movement: affirmative action and quotas.
<p>	Originally conceived by President Kennedy, affirmative action was designed to encourage institutions to make a concerted effort to be inclusive of all people. Podhoretz always supported this. In his 1979 memoirs, Breaking Ranks, Podhoretz recalled saying when the debate had begun earlier in that decade that "I supported special efforts to recruit qualified blacks and that I also supported special efforts to help unqualified blacks compete on an equal footing." But affirmative action had soon become a series of programs and benefits intended to give preference to people based upon their race, and, over time, upon their ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation as well. And, to Podhoretz, this violated a crucial tenet of his liberalism -- that an individual should not be judged on the basis of an involuntary characteristic. Consequently, Podhoretz made <i>Commentary</i> the intellectual center of opposition to affirmative action. Throughout the 1970s, <i>Commentary</i> attacked affirmative action from every angle.

<p>
	<i>Commentary</i> authors were among the first to argue that those who would suffer the most from affirmative action programs would be the intended beneficiaries; that those not slated to "benefit" from affirmative action would react bitterly when a member of a preferred group received an admissions slot or a job on the basis of race or another superfluous category; and that those "minorities" in the institutions would constantly feel the need to prove themselves worthy, to demonstrate that they were not a "quota hire." As Michael Novak noted in a 1976 <i>Commentary</i> article, "If you grant no responsibility or hope for their own advancement to blacks, but treat their needs as in every respect due to a form of victimization, then no one calls you a racist; you are regarded, instead, as a friend to blacks. 'Don't blame the victim' is the slogan of such friendship. But if, on the other hand, you assert that blacks are equal to whites in potency, moral spirit, dignity, responsibility, and power over their own future, and deny that they are mere pawns and victims, then you set off a chorus of alarums and find yourself on treacherous emotional territory."
<p>
<b>The Failure of Nerve</b>
<p>	After the American defeat in Vietnam, Podhoretz saw this same shifting of responsibility that liberalism had come to embody on the international scene. Podhoretz believed the Vietnam War was a major tactical blunder, but America's misfortune should not serve as a precedent. America was the same great, powerful, and responsible nation that she was when she embarked on this mistaken path. And when the United States had to become engaged militarily in the future, she should do so with a clear conscience and with strength of will.
<p>	This was not so easily done. The Vietnam War had taken quite a toll on the American people: As Midge Decter explained in a 1976 <i>Commentary</i> symposium, "Defeat (and it is a tribute to something that one should feel impelled to remind on this point) is not good for people. And it is no better for nations than for individuals. It humiliates, raises doubts, heightens acrimony, increases recourse to tricky euphemism, and stirs up all those lurking and treacherously seductive fantasies of escape. Most of all, it paralyzes, and once again does so no less to nations than to individuals."
<p>	In the wake of the defeat in Vietnam, Podhoretz worried about what he called "a failure of nerve" triggering "a culture of appeasement." The Soviet Union was as evil as ever, gobbling up nations and subjecting them to totalitarian terror. As he wrote in <i>Commentary</i> in 1976, the Soviet Union is "the most determined, ferocious and barbarous enemy ever to have appeared on the earth." Podhoretz resurrected the argument that Communism is morally equivalent to Nazism; in fact more dangerous in one respect -- intellectuals and their young charges had never been attracted to Nazism. 
<p>	 How to stop Soviet aggression? Only the United States would have the power to do so, and effective resistance would demand not only substantial resources but a will to win. And in the mid-1970s, following Vietnam, Podhoretz was worried that such a will did not exist. "While the Soviet Union engages in the most massive military buildup in the history of the world, we haggle over every weapon. We treat our own military leaders as though they were wearing the uniform of a foreign power. Everything they tell us about our military needs is greeted with hostility." Podhoretz savaged anyone who stood in the way of this American effort. That included not only the political and intellectual Left, but the business community as well: Corporate moguls were all too ready to sacrifice anti-communist principle for the profits in trading and dealing with America's totalitarian enemies. Self-indulgence on the Right was, according to Podhoretz, just as bad as self-indulgence on the Left. Two books he published in this period, <i>The Present Danger</i> and <i>Why We Were in Vietnam</i>, sought to establish the righteousness of the anticommunist cause, and the moral and military readiness of the United States to prosecute it.
<p>	In addition to his own writing, Podhoretz published many important articles on these subjects. Especially notable were Richard Pipes's work on the Soviet Union and Robert Tucker's essays on the danger posed by the oil-producing states. But the most significant essay he published during that period was Jeane Kirkpatrick's "Dictatorships and Double Standards," in November 1979. Kirkpatrick wrote that anticommunism should be the priority of American foreign policy, even if that meant making alliances with nondemocratic, authoritarian governments. Communist governments were worse than noncommunist authoritarian governments because the former destroy civil society and ruin the lives of all of their inhabitants.
<p>	"Dictatorships and Double Standards" was widely read: One prominent reader was Ronald Reagan, then running for president. He expressed his admiration for Kirkpatrick, and later appointed her U.S. ambassador to the United Nations when he became president. Kirkpatrick used her position as a bully pulpit from which to defend American values and interests and to excoriate its enemies in the Communist bloc and the Third World.
<p>	Kirkpatrick was not the first <i>Commentary</i> writer to defend Podhoretz's ideals from the floor of the United Nations. In the 1970s, there was no place where the ideas of communism -- or at least the idea that communism was no worse than American democracy -- were more prevalent than in the United Nations. Often combined with virulent anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism, the Soviet Union and its Third World charges passed resolutions blasting the West and the Jews. And the West, by and large, had little to say in response. At least, until Norman Podhoretz gained influence in that body. In 1975, Podhoretz published a remarkable essay by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, "The United States in Opposition," calling upon the West to take up the war of ideas with the pernicious forces of the Soviet Union and the Third World. This article also was widely read -- Secretary of State Henry Kissinger called to congratulate its author -- and President Gerald Ford responded by appointing Moynihan ambassador to the United Nations. 
<p>	Moynihan took the job in 1975, at the height of the anti-Semitism and anti-Western sentiment in the U.N. The United States could not have found a better man to respond to the virulent ideological challenge being put forth by her enemies. In November 1975, Ugandan dictator Idi Amin took to the floor of the United Nations to deliver one of the most anti-Semitic speeches given since Hitler. Maintaining that "the United States of America has been colonized by the Zionists who hold all the tools of development and power," Amin called upon the United States to "rid their society of the Zionists," and for the United Nations to pursue the "extinction of Israel as a state." The United Nations delegates responded with a standing ovation, and the accompanying resolution that he sponsored -- "Zionism is a form of racism and racial discrimination" -- passed easily. A majority of the nations of the world had, in the very institution that was once the hope of liberalism in the wake of Nazism, passed a resolution that Hitler could have offered, and did so with a fervor Hitler would have admired. A response was needed, and Ambassador Moynihan turned to his old editor for advice.
<p>	Podhoretz drafted most of the speech with which Moynihan responded. It was a moving address, one that sent shock waves through the United Nations and upset countless liberals. That speech, and the events leading up to it, are masterfully recounted in Moynihan's memoirs of his service at the United Nations, <i>A Dangerous Place</i>, which is dedicated to Norman Podhoretz and Leonard Garment. Moynihan became so popular in New York as a result of that speech that he was catapulted to the United States Senate in 1976, with Norman Podhoretz as one of his principal advisors.
<p>	By the end of the 1970s, liberalism had, in the mind of Norman Podhoretz, become so corrupted that there was no longer any place for him in it or in the Democratic Party. Although Podhoretz did not resign from the Democratic Party, he voted for Ronald Reagan -- the first time he voted Republican in a presidential election. But he had good reason to do so; Ronald Reagan and his staff took the ideas in <i>Commentary</i> very seriously, and <i>The Present Danger</i> was required reading in the Reagan campaign.
<p>	While Reagan's stance toward Communism and Israel were the main reasons for Podhoretz's support, Podhoretz had also become more conservative on domestic issues. Midge Decter calls an aversion to capitalism "the last vestige of our liberalism," and they were supporters of capitalism by 1981 when Podhoretz published "The New Defenders of Capitalism" in the <i>Harvard Business Review</i>. In that article he wrote:<p><blockquote>
	"[Capitalism] is a necessary, if not a sufficient, condition of freedom; it is both a necessary and a sufficient condition of wealth; it provides a better chance than any known alternative for the most widespread sharing in the wealth it produces."
</blockquote><p>

	His support for capitalism deepened throughout the decade, as he published important pieces on the subject by its great celebrators George Gilder and Michael Novak. Podhoretz also saw clearly the failures of the welfare state, and opened his pages to thinkers like Charles Murray, who diagnosed its brutal unintended consequences. He also maintained an assault on affirmative action; indeed, Thomas Sowell's December 1989 essay, "Affirmative Action: A Worldwide Disaster," may be the best critique of quotas ever penned.
<p>	But his prime area of interest remained foreign policy. Though many of his contributors, friends, and relatives (notably his son-in-law Elliott Abrams) served in high positions in the Reagan administration, Podhoretz harshly criticized the president for capitulating to the Soviets. His 1982 <i>New York Times Magazine</i> article, "The Neoconservative Anguish over Reagan's Foreign Policy," makes this case quite succinctly. Podhoretz detected Reagan's tendency, as George Will put it, to love commerce more than loathe communism -- and make deals with the Soviets when his corporate constituency thought that doing so would yield a profit. Podhoretz stated boldly that America's most important responsibility was to fight the evil of communism.
<p>
<b>Fighter for the Right </b><p>
	After those 412 issues of <i>Commentary</i>, what has Norman Podhoretz taught us? Several important lessons. He has taught us that everything we treasure is fragile, and needs constant attention and defense. The implosion of liberalism in the 1960s is destroying our university system. The ideas of Martin Luther King Jr. were bastardized into support for race-based preferences that are anathema to the central liberal principle that people should be judged on their individual merits.
<p>	Leftism took over liberalism because Leftists never forgot, as others did, that ideas -- not economic interests, not social arrangements -- rule the world. Podhoretz has constantly reminded us of this truth, when he stressed that freedom could only be preserved if America had the will to defend it herself, when he bore witness to the original tenets of the civil-rights movement, when he scored communism and supported Israel. In his valedictory statement in the June 1995 issue of <i>Commentary</i>, Podhoretz quotes Theodore Roosevelt. "Aggressive fighting for the right is the noblest sport the world affords." Podhoretz has spent a long and fruitful career fighting for the right, and we are all indebted to him for it.

<p>

<i>While the Congress is primarily responsible for national domestic policy, the president is the commander in chief of the armed forces and is chiefly responsible for America's foreign policy. Next year's presidential race is therefore an important opportunity for Americans to debate the direction of America's military and our country's role in the world. In late September,</i> <b>Policy Review</b> <i>asked eight leading conservatives to define the most important defense and foreign-policy issues of the 1996 elections.</i>
<p>
<b><a name="george></a>GEORGE WEIGEL</b>
<p>	The United States has not had a foreign policy since January 20, 1993. Before then, with the exception of the Gulf War, the foreign and defense policies of the Bush administration were geared not to shaping the post-Cold War future, but to managing the Cold War's endgame. The Republican president inaugurated on January 20, 1997, will thus have an immense responsibility: creating the first post-Cold War foreign policy worthy of the name.
<p>	If the candidates in the 1996 GOP presidential primaries could forge agreement on the following six points, presidential leadership in 1997 and beyond will prove much easier:
<p><ol>

	<li>The United States needs a foreign policy. With the end of the Cold War, time, energy, and resources can and must be directed toward reconstructing civil society in America. But disengagement is not an option for the world's leading democracy and leading military power. The proliferation of ballistic-missile technology and weapons of mass destruction, hostile ideologies, and international terrorism place America always at risk. The risks are manageable, but not unless they are acknowledged and dealt with.<p>
<li>The completion and preservation of freedom's victory in the Cold War requires the expansion of NATO before the end of the century. Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, and Slovakia should be admitted as full members, and Ukraine and the Baltic states engaged in some form of associate membership en route to full participation. As even Strobe Talbott now concedes, NATO expansion is a mortal threat neither to Russia nor to the evolution of Russian democracy. An appropriate security relationship can be defined between the new NATO and the Russian Federation while the former democracy evolves. If the history of Europe in the 20th century teaches us anything, it is that an ounce of preventive diplomacy and collective security is worth a ton of terrible cure.
<P>

<li>Preventing the spread of ballistic-missile technology and weapons of mass destruction ought to be one of the highest priorities of U.S. national-security policy. This means clamping down on regimes that import or export such weapons, as well as improving counter-terrorist measures. The new president should confer quietly with Congress and America's principal allies on the conditions under which preemptive military action will be used to counter weapons proliferation against rogue states or terrorist organizations. The president should appoint a national coordinator of counter-terrorism, and he should instruct the relevant intelligence agencies and the FBI that a coordinated counter-terrorism program is essential to national security and that institutional roadblocks put in its way will be swiftly removed. <p>
<li>The essential technological complement to an assertive policy of nonproliferation and counter-terrorism is missile defense. It is criminally irresponsible to deny the American people and America's allies the benefits of missile-defense systems just because of Cold War shibboleths. Early in his term, the new president, in consultation with the Congress, should announce America's withdrawal from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, while pledging to share appropriate defense technologies with its allies.
<p><li>For tens of millions of people around the world, the United States remains a beacon of freedom. U.S. human-rights policy must be reinvigorated, stressing the universality of such basic human rights as religious freedom, free speech, freedom of association, and freedom of the press. The United States should rebut the argument that these rights are "culturally conditioned," while making vigorous use of instruments like the National Endowment for Democracy to support proponents of freedom living in totalitarian and authoritarian societies. We should place special emphasis on aid to the democratic opposition in China and Cuba.
<p><li>On its 50th anniversary, the United Nations is in desperate straits. It has demonstrated its ineptitude at "peacekeeping" in Bosnia, its functional agencies (like the World Health Organization) are awash in corruption, and the "soft" side of the U.N. has become a hotbed of internationalized libertinism, as demonstrated by the 1994 (anti-) population conference in Cairo and the 1995 Beijing conference on women. The next administration should reform the U.N. and its functional agencies, while shunning wastes of time and energy like the Cairo and Beijing conferences and the 1995 Copenhagen "Social Summit." If, by the year 2000, the U.N. has not been dramatically cleaned up and slimmed down, another Republican administration should seriously consider withdrawing from an institution that, at present, hinders the pursuit of the very ends it was intended to serve.

<p>Any candidate worthy of consideration should begin by understanding and expressing that the peace and prosperity we enjoy were dearly bought with the blood of Americans on countless battlefields the world over. No nation has given more selflessly to the cause of liberty; no nation has ever had a people wiser in distinguishing among the nations of the world our natural friends, our inevitable enemies, and the barbarians to be left alone. Thanks to the sacrifices of American people, we can say today, as Abraham Lincoln said a century and a half ago, that "all the armies of Europe, Asia, and Africa combined with all the treasure of the earth, our own excepted, could not by force make a track on the Blue Ridge or take a drink from the Ohio in a trial of a thousand years."
<p>	So, candidates, begin with pride in your country and gratitude to its people. We are a great country and deserve a prominent place in world affairs. We must never diminish our strength and purpose, since as Charles de Gaulle used to jest, the future lasts a long time. Serious threats will surely arise; whether they prove deadly will depend on us. Americans can be defeated or our interests thwarted only if we lose our moral virtues, make foolish moves in the world, and neglect our military power. No government has ever matched the Clinton administration in these failings.
<p>	America's only glaring weakness over the past half-century has been leadership sometimes unworthy of the American people. The nation's "leadership class" -- high officials, professors, and heads of big corporations -- has committed America's youth, blood, and credit to wars it did not intend to win. Communism was here to stay, they thought, and even Republican stars such as Henry Kissinger counseled accommodation with it. They dreamed not of freedom's triumph but of convergence and accommodation to tyranny. They dreamed up the idiocy that America's safety depends on continued vulnerability to missile attack, a doctrine that still prevails in Washington. These opportunities to equivocate will come again.
<p>	Since President Bush's time, this leadership class has decided that political and military history has ended and that our real enemies are the French and Japanese who sell us cheese and cars at good prices.
<p>	First observation: Foreign policy does not exist in a vacuum; it must have military capability to protect and project it. Diplomacy without power is a prayer -- not to God, but to one's adversary, and its fulfillment depends on the mood and whim of the party prayed to. No nation can devise a military posture until it has defined its purpose through national interest. America, therefore, needs a new doctrine to replace Monroe and containment.
<p>Such a doctrine must acknowledge that America has legitimate interests. First is the defense of the homeland. 
<p>	Second, our economy depends on trade. We need access to our trading partners.
<p>	Third, we are a nation that values travelfor trade, scholarship, science, and pleasure. Americans abroad must have a nation behind them.
<p>	Lastly, America's interest in regional stability cannot be ignored. If America's presence and purpose in the world can be doubted, if we tolerate vacuums of power, they will be filled by others, and ultimately American blood will be spilled. In the past century, we have been called upon time and again to secure peace and liberty after our leaders thought the world no longer needed us.
<p>	Along with the doctrine we need common sense -- in both diplomacy and military policy. This means not squandering American generosity in petty ventures cooked up by the U.N.'s petty bureaucrats. While our leaders downsize the U.S. military and tergiversate with our commitments to traditional allies in Europe and the Pacific Rim, the future and vitality of those regions is being shaped by petty tyrants whose only asset is the willingness to make war. The administration treats military matters as a spectator sport. The foreign-policy establishment calls Americans' objections to such leadership by turns warmongering and isolationism. Our candidates should recognize these objections as wisdom.
<p>	Collective response is a contemporary stupidity. The U.N. cannot respond, nor can Europe nor NATO nor the Pacific nations, unless one of them is both willing and able to respond alone. Joiners follow leaders, but when joiners have no leaders, they have conferences.
<p>	As for Bosnia, the president and the supreme Allied commander in Europe should tell our allies to join us in giving Serbia an ultimatum to stop the Balkan war or else face a united declaration of war by NATO's 15 nations. Otherwise, America should quit NATO, lift the embargo, and arm the Bosnians. The continuing policy vacuum has sapped America's prestige abroad and fostered European excuses for death, destruction, and "ethnic cleansing" in their own backyard.
<p>	Lastly, America needs missile defenses. There can be no further excuses for inaction. Even Democrats say that nothing so threatens regions and continents as the proliferation of nuclear weapons. To the nuclear threat, we can now add chemical and biological weapons. The Clinton idiocy is to make us all equally vulnerable. America has the technology to protect Americans and American allies from missiles. What possible excuse can be offered for failure to act? Why should Americans or their allies be threatened and blackmailed because our leaders are hooked on treaties and invalid concepts further outmoded by recent events?
<p>	Respect for Americans, pride in our selfless achievements in this dark century, and confidence in our future are the basis of military and foreign policy. These Americans are a wise and brave lot, and they deserve both common sense and courage from their leaders.

<p>	In a time of great uncertainty about America's role in the world, it is not the details of America's foreign policy that trouble her citizens so much as the sense that the man in the White House doesn't know what he's doing. Republican candidates will be tempted to dwell on the Clinton administration's specific foreign-policy blunders. Some of this will, of course, be necessary and valuable. But the American people will not and should not be satisfied solely with an indictment of the president's actions. 
<p>	Clinton's main problem as commander in chief is that, like many American liberals, he is uncomfortable with America's power. This makes him uncertain about how to use it. And this uncertainty is the source of the administration's misguided foreign and defense policies. The 1996 election is a superb opportunity to craft an alternative vision of presidential leadership. Articulating this vision, rather than promising a specific blueprint, should be the focus of the presidential campaign.
<p>By seeking the U.N.'s blessing on the American-led operation in the Persian Gulf War, where U.S. interests were clearly at stake, President Bush showed that Washington was uncertain about its newly acquired status as sole superpower. Over the past three years, the Clinton administration has taken this precedent to extremes. It has subjected U.S. and NATO actions in Bosnia to U.N. approval, even where those actions directly risked the lives of troops from our major NATO allies. It has accommodated U.N.-instigated "nation-building" in Somalia, going well beyond the Bush administration's original humanitarian objectives. In an astounding abandonment of American prerogatives, Clinton sought U.N. approval of the occupation of Haiti last fall, but sought no such approval from Congress. 
<p>	Many Americans have passively accepted the notion, implicit in Clinton's approach, that actions taken in the name of the U.N. are morally purer than actions taken or led by the United States. A look at the source of U.N. power reveals the emptiness of this point of view. 
<p.	Whereas American decisions are shaped by Virginians, Texans, Rhode Islanders, and the free citizens of 47 other states, a majority of the nations represented at the U.N. have political and social structures that are, to one degree or another, undemocratic. Many have governments that abuse their citizens and threaten other nations. None of the representatives at the U.N., including our own, is freely elected. 
<p>	Presidential candidates need to articulate the argument in a straightforward way: American power is the greatest force for good in the material world, and that power is derived from our Constitution, not from the U.N. Charter. How can the decisions of the United Nations have greater moral authority than those taken by the U.S. Congress which, despite its flaws, embodies the most representative and accountable political system in the world? No president should feel guilty for using wisely American power derived from our constitutional system. 
<p>	As they make this argument, candidates must brace themselves for the inevitable charge of "isolationism." The use of this term, now being leveled against the administration's congressional critics, is meant to conjure up frightening images of the 1930s and the unchallenged rise of fascism. It fits neatly with the liberal view of the world, which sees our commitment to world leadership and our participation in the United Nations as one and the same. Much like the domestic debate over welfare, this worldview also equates our "compassion" for developing nations to the amount of foreign aid money we give away. 
<p>	The candidates must explain, in positive terms, America's deep involvement in world affairs, and how this has very little to do with either the United Nations or our foreign-aid program. The combined dollar value of our foreign-aid budget and our contribution to the U.N. amounts to a tiny fraction of our private-sector trade. And we should not forget that much of our $270 billion military budget goes to keep the peace around the world, which is in everyone's interest. 
<p>In a very imperfect world, our military and economic power is derived from the fairest, most humane system of government ever devised. This should be a source of tremendous confidence for a president, not confusion and embarrassment.
<p>As a trading partner, a military ally, and a beacon of democracy, the United States has a huge stake in world affairs. The successful candidate should affirm these roles and dispute any suggestion that our internationalism should be measured by the degree of our subservience to U.N. policies.

<p>Foreign policy without armed force is like sheet music without the orchestra. We must be concerned about the Big Questions, but we must not neglect what has been happening to the "orchestra." 
<p>General George C. Marshall once said, "The soldier's heart, the soldier's spirit, the soldier's soul are everything. Unless the soldier's soul sustains him, he cannot be relied on and will fail himself and his country in the end." Marshall understood the decisive military importance of the intangible moral factors. No doubt he knew Napoleon's dictum that "in warfare, the moral is to the material as three is to one." 
<p>	The Clinton administration appears bent on crippling the military's moral powers as well as its material strength. Though it's uncomfortable, Americans must face the fact that revolutionary social policies are undermining the cohesion and combat effectiveness of the forces. Political correctness is replacing military character.
<p>	Most uniformed people agree, but dare not say it openly. Thus the problem of women in combat roles or homosexuals in the ranks is compounded by an institutionalized lie necessary to inject social deconstruction into an unwilling organism. And it leaches away the ethic of honor and integrity that are the heart of an effective military. Junior ranks see their seniors denying what everybody knows and forcing others to lie. They see careers of fine officers ruined because they will not genuflect to falsehood. They see flag officers putting self-interest above the welfare of their people. The moral damage is potentially disastrous.
<p>	Since a soldier must be "obedient unto death," sending him into battle is a moral transaction. He must be certain his life will not be wasted because of moral blindness or character defects in his commander. If his leaders are contemptuous of his sacrifice -- as was the British commander who reportedly remarked in the disastrous Gallipoli campaign in 1915, "Casualties? What do I care about casualties?" -- it breaks the vital link that enables him to do the bloody, terrifying work of grappling with and killing the enemy.
<p>	But mutual trust does not happen overnight. It takes attention and commitment. Commissioned and non-commissioned officers have to set good examples, displaying truthfulness and integrity as well as military competence. Any policy that undermines this process hurts national defense as surely as cutting the budget or canceling vital weapons programs. 
<p>	Liberals have a teleological compulsion to remake every institution in their own image, and politicize everything they touch. They love to get their hands on the military, largely because it is a command institution and can be reshaped with relative ease from the top down (just as the Left, which is antidemocratic despite its sanctimonious posturing, would like to do to our entire society). 
<p>	To be sure, most military men still cling to the martial virtues, the very antithesis of liberal enlightenment. The military may yet manage to remain resistant to alien transformation. But it may still be forced to undertake more "acceptable" missions, like nation-building and peacekeeping, even though the operations in Somalia and Haiti got men killed, hurt morale, and cost hundreds of millions of dollars, without benefiting any vital national interest. Liberals hope thereby to drain away the ethos of the warrior and replace it with the ethos of the global welfare caseworker.
<p>	Social policy and defense policy intersect at this issue. It could unite conservatives concerned about national security with those worried about the moral health of the nation. But strangely, Republican presidential candidates haven't focused on it. They are missing a good bet. In 1993, Clinton's decision to open the services to homosexuals generated an unprecedented outpouring of opposition. That deep reservoir of concern about the welfare of the armed forces is still there, waiting to be tapped. 
<p>	Perhaps it is hard to believe that the force that triumphed so magnificently in the Persian Gulf War could ever lose its soul. After all, that extraordinary victory was due as much to superior motivation, morale, leadership, and training as it was to technological superiority. Nevertheless, we cannot afford to take these qualities for granted, for they require constant cultivation. Throughout history, complacency has always been the forerunner of military disaster. Because it occurs outside the material domain, damage to the military spirit can't be quantified. It is subtle, insidious, and generally not noticed until it is revealed in the unforgiving crucible of combat.
<p>	Every candidate who wants to become commander in chief had better make sure he will have reliable forces to carry out the nation's foreign policy and defend our vital interests. Otherwise he may one day find this now unmatched military instrument crumbling in his hands just when it is needed most.

<p>	In July 1992, members of the Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces visited the carrier U.S.S. John F. Kennedy, to hear what Navy men thought about the question of women in combat. In anticipation of the two-day field trip, the Kennedy's commanding officer recorded a videotape encouraging all crew members to express their opinions freely -- whether in favor or opposed --provided they were prepared to explain their rationale.
<p>	Since that time, a great deal has changed. Almost nothing remains of the laws and rules exempting women from service in or near the front lines, and candor about the consequences of unprecedented policy changes now in progress can end a military career.
<p>	The armed forces have become a prime venue for social experimentation because those most directly affected must follow orders, without visible dissent. Navy Secretary John Dalton's new policy regarding pregnant women on combat ships, for example, forbids "adverse comments" about deployability problems resulting from absences due to pregnancy.
<p>	At a time when international commitments are growing, defense budgets are shrinking, and the armed forces are carrying a heavy burden of social and cultural change, the next president must insist on complete information and objective evaluations throughout the chain of command. He must also be willing to reverse experimental policies that detract from morale, discipline, unit strength, and overall readiness.
<p>	A pro-defense administration should begin with sound priorities. Contrary to the notion that the volunteer force exists to provide job opportunities, the next president must recognize that the armed forces exist to defend the country, and the needs of the military must come first.
<p>	Technology and hardware are important, but money alone cannot buy a strong national defense. Wars are deterred, or fought, not by computers and weapons, but by people -- young men and women who volunteer to defend their country in a still-dangerous world, despite countless sacrifices and personal risk. To improve the recruitment and retention of qualified troops, we must avoid anything that makes military life more difficult or dangerous.
<p>	Current policies placing women in or near close combat units must be reevaluated -- not in terms of career opportunities, but in terms of military strength and readiness. Lives must not be sacrificed, nor missions undermined, because of front-line soldiers who are less strong, less deployable, and more vulnerable to wartime violence and capture. The definition of the word "qualified," as in "qualified to do the job," must not become flexible and therefore meaningless for the sake of women or any other favored group.
<p>	Affirmative-action quotas that subvert high training standards historically based on merit and wartime requirements should be ended by executive order. In the tradition of Harry Truman, who promoted social change by ending racial segregation in the armed forces, the next president should insist on policies that judge people as individuals, not as members of groups.
<p>	The next president must seek a more sensible balancebetween the interests of parents, field commanders, and children who stand to lose the most when their mothers are sent to fight a war. Overly generous pregnancy benefits offered without regard to marital status, for example, degrade cultural values while escalating family stress, child-care costs, and non-deployability numbers. Disciplinary problems must be addressed as well, since human emotions do not always respond to military orders.
<p>The Clinton administration has persisted in promoting homosexuality as an acceptable lifestyle, despite the law passed in 1993 intended to exclude homosexuals from the military. The next president should deny the gay agenda, which has gained significant ground in all branches of government, including the uniformed services.
<p>	Ronald Reagan, who enlisted but did not serve in the front lines, demonstrated that a pro-defense presidency does not depend on military background alone. In the tradition of Ronald Reagan, the next commander in chief must convey a deep respect for military values, and be willing to defend the interests of the troops against civilian activists with different agendas.
<p>	Clinton has tried to convey respect for the military by using soldiers, sailors, and aviators as backdrops for "photo ops." The next commander in chief must earn the respect of the troops by standing on principle, not public relations.

	The three most important foreign-policy and defense issues of the 1996 elections are America's vulnerability to nuclear missiles, foreign aid, and the extent of America's international engagement, including the use of force overseas.
<p>	    In a post-Cold War world, a nuclear attack against American territory poses the single gravest security challenge. Despite several strategic-arms control agreements signed over the last decade, Russia retains a large nuclear arsenal. China is also modernizing its nuclear forces. A number of other countries are aggressively developing small, but potent, nuclear forces.
<p>   America's failure to deploy ballistic-missile defenses doesn't just perpetuate our national vulnerability. It also greatly weakens our diplomatic prowess. Imagine how different the outcome of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait might have been if, just as the Bush administration was contemplating its options, Saddam Hussein had informed the world that he had already built a dozen or so nuclear-tipped ICBMs.
<p>	Contrary to the musings of traditional arms-control theorists, American ballistic-missile defense deployments are likely to discourage other countries from embarking on the path of nuclear proliferation. I suggest that the candidate inform the American public about our vulnerability to nuclear attack and explain the imperative, including costs, of appropriate solutions. I propose a measured missile-defense program that deploys "brilliant pebbles"-like weapons as its first phase.
<p>	The popularity of foreign aid with the American people has reached a nadir. Americans complain, correctly, that significant amounts of U.S. aid have been misdirected, and many object to providing any foreign assistance when we have urgent domestic problems. But foreign aid, if it advances specific U.S. national interests, can be a useful foreign policy investment. I recommend that the presidential candidate begin a candid dialogue with the American people about the merits of a judicious foreign-aid program. While streamilining our foreign aid delivery by merging AID into the state department and eliminating wasteful social and developmental programs, I would show how it serves America's interest to use foreign aid to promote democracy and free markets in other countries. Furthermore, U.S. aid should be provided directly to its intended recipients rather than funneled through international institutions.
<p>	Finally, the use of American troops in such places as Somalia and Haiti and the speculation that American ground forces may be sent into combat in the former Yugoslavia have reintensified the long-standing debate about the proper scope of America's international engagement and the role of force in support of our national interests.
<p>	Presented with these realities, I suggest reestablishing the basic public consensus on this critical national-security issue. The American people need to understand that we must remain a key international player and that our troops should be deployed for combat overseas only when vital American interests are at stake. Once deployed, our troops should be given all the resources they need to prevail in combat quickly and decisively. Nothing would be more harmful than the specter of American forces suffering casualties because they either lacked heavy armor (as in Mogadishu), could not engage in an air-defense suppression (as in Bosnia), or were commanded by bungling U.N. officials.

<p>
	There are two foreign and military policy issues that seem to me of greatest significance during the forthcoming campaign.
<p>	The first issue is missile defense. The spread of nuclear weapons and missile technology can be slowed but not avoided, for primitive versions of the bomb and of delivery systems are, after all, 50-year-old technology. The bizarre theory of mutual assured destruction and the obsolete Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty keep us defenseless against all logic, and the time has come to replace them with a policy of defending the country. The more plainly candidates speak about this, the more public support there will be.
<P>	The second issue is intervention: When do we risk the lives of our soldiers in crises overseas? This is obviously a complex issue and, with the Cold War over, many Americans (including some candidates) will be tempted to answer: "Never." I would like to see a candidate address this issue in more or less the following manner:<p><blockquote>
	"During the Cold War, we had to lead a coalition of nations against the twin threats of communism and Soviet power. We rose to that struggle and won it, and our victory saved our own freedom was well as the freedom of hundreds of millions of others.<p>
	"Now that it is over, we can do less and spend less overseas. There are places on the globe that simply don't matter enough to demand American involvement. But just as we had interests to defend before there was a Cold War, and just as there were threats to us before then, the same is true now.
<p>	"Some of these interests are very old: The first American statesmen saw what we had at stake in Mexico and the Caribbean; today, drug and migration flows are still major issues. Some interests are new: The spread of nuclear weapons and missile technology now gives small nations and terrorist groups the ability to strike at America. But it is clear that a world in which every petty tyrant is armed to the teeth, and our foreign markets are in turmoil, and our own region is plagued by instability, will not be a very good gift to our children. America still has an irreplaceable role if the world is to be a less dangerous place.
<p>	"Why us? Because our wealth, power, and freedom grant us the leadership of the world's democracies. It is true that our power provides a continual temptation to meddle in situations where our interests do not require us to jump in, and one test of a president is to keep his cool and stay out of those.
<p>	"But if we are to keep the world moving toward freedom, and protect our freedom, safety, and prosperity, we cannot act as if we lived on some other planet. Another test of a president is to know when our interests really are at risk today, and the toughest test is to understand when they will be at risk tomorrow if we don't act now. We can pass those tests or fail them, but we cannot avoid them."</blockquote><p>

<p>	The overriding foreign-policy issue in the coming presidential campaign is the loss of the strong place America held in 1991the year of victory in the Persian Gulf War and the formal disintegration of the Soviet Union -- and the nation's progressive weakness in international affairs. Do the American people approve of this direction?<p>
	Presidential candidates would be wise to reject the conventional wisdom that Americans are uninterested in foreign policy, that their desire to address serious domestic problems comes at the expense of concerns about U.S. influence abroad. Voter confusion is understandable, since no national political leader has explained why Americans should be interested. The task of a challenger is to show plainly what a world bereft of American leadership looks like. This should be at the heart of any conservative presidential candidate's foreign-policy position.<p>
	At risk in Bosnia is America's historical commitment to the principle that employing force to seize another country is unacceptable. The current administration has effectively given the U.N. secretary-general veto power over the use of our forces in the Balkans. This failure has neutered U.S. policy there and promises to cripple it in the future.
<p>	Up to now, American weakness in Bosnia -- as evidenced by years of inaction, and demonstrably poor military advice -- 0has encouraged only one leader (Jacques Chirac of democratic France) to fill the void. But if this administration's incomprehensible Bosnia policy continues, it will eventually embolden some dangerous challenger armed with nuclear weapons. The conflict in the former Yugoslavia could also spread throughout the Balkans and beyond. Presidential candidates should remind voters of this century's brutal history and of America's immediate economic and security interest in maintaining a peaceful, prosperous Europe.
<p>	To underline the character of excessive multilateralism, the eventual challenger to Clinton in 1996 should use in a political advertisement the videotape of the U.N. spokesman Ahmad Fawzi's press announcement on July 26. That's when he declared that "the secretary-general has decided to delegate the necessary authority [to conduct air strikes against Bosnian Serb positions] to commanders in the field." Insofar as Mr. Boutros Boutros-Ghali really holds the power to decide when American commanders may or may not use force, the challenger should make the current administration's responsibility for this plain. Voters will not be pleased.
<p>	America's gyrating policies in Asia for the past three years undermine this nation's general commitment to free trade, as well as its specific commercial and security ties to Japan and the future of its relationship with China. Asia has the fastest-growing economies in the world, and American exports there support more than three million jobs. Blown by domestic political winds, the current administration's policies in Asia have touched every point on the compass. Going to the brink of a trade war with Japan is, politically, perhaps unassailable. But if Japan is true to form, there will be no significant increases in imports of American auto parts by this time next year. 
<p>	The challenger should exploit this fact. He should call attention to the inconsistency between the administration's support for NAFTA and GATT, and its managed-trade policy towards Japan. He should also note that Japan is slowly becoming more democratic by itself, and that U.S. pressure for managed trade thwarts this evolution.
<p>	Finally, the candidate should demonstrate that he will take his responsibility as commander in chief seriously. A missile defense is only one thing that this administration is ignoring in order to keep the military as ready as it needed to be during the Cold War. America now has within its technological grasp the ability simultaneously to reduce defense spending and construct a military that can move swiftly to any part of the world, and from a safe distance wield decisive conventional power. This is the kind of force that we should be building, not a smaller version of the Cold War model. To achieve this, the defense department must shrink the huge and ungainly central bureaucracy it has developed over the years. The candidate will be on firm ground in arguing that the sound political principle of decentralization and returning authority to the states should apply equally to the wise management of the nation's defenses.
<p>	It has been years since a presidential candidate said anything about defense except that there should be more of it, or less of it. The candidate who breaks this pattern next year will add to his qualification as prospective commander in chief, and perform for the defense department a vital task that it may not be able to accomplish on its own.

<h3>America Eyes the Virginia Elections</h3>
<hr size=3 width=50%>
<b>Joel Himelfarb</b><br>
<b>Policy Review</b><br>
<i>Fall 1995, Number 74</i></center>
<p>
	This November, voters in Virginia, New Jersey, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Kentucky will have the opportunity to tell their elected representatives whether they are happy with the new conservative direction in American politics. This represents the first chance since the conservative GOP landslide of 1994 for large numbers of voters to go the polls, so the state races of 1995 will provide the first electoral indication of whether America is entering a period of fundamental political realignment.<p>	One of the most significant bellwethers will be elections for the General Assembly in Virginia. All 100 seats of the House of Delegates and all 40 seats of the Senate are up for balloting, and the ideological differences between the two parties are as clearly defined as in the national congressional elections of 1994. Republican Governor George Allen, elected in 1993, has pushed a wide-ranging agenda to put a more conservative stamp on Virginia government. Splitting mostly along partisan lines, the Democratic-controlled General Assembly has rejected most of his proposals, including tax and spending cuts, school choice, and prison-construction measures. <p>	Allen (who is limited by state law to a single four-year term) says that this year's General Assembly "will go down in history as one of the least productive ever. We sadly saw the Democratic defenders of 'business-as-usual' status quo mount unprecedented party-line defenses against those of us championing positive and constructive change." <p>	Republicans haven't controlled either house of the Virginia General Assembly in modern times. But recent national and state political trends have given the Democratic leadership in the legislature ample reason to worry. When Douglas Wilder was elected governor in 1989, the Democrats enjoyed majorities of nearly 2:1 in the House, and 3:1 in the Senate. This year, they may lose control of both houses of the General Assembly. In the House, their majority has fallen to 52-47 (with one independent) and their margin in the Sen
ate is just 22-18. Republican success in November could usher in reform on some of the most important issues facing the state and the nation: crime, taxes and spending, education, welfare reform, and the relationship between Virginia and the federal government.<p><b>Crime</b><p>
	From 1988 to 1993, the state's violent-crime rate rose nearly 30 percent, even though the most crime-prone age bracket (15-24) had declined. Felons were, on average, serving just one-third of their sentences. The average individual convicted of first-degree murder, for example, received a term of 35 years but spent just 10 years in jail.<p>	Democrats in the legislature endorsed Allen initiatives to abolish parole and increase prison time by 125 percent for first-time murderers and rapists, to consider violent offenses committed as juveniles when sentencing adult offenders, and to enact truth-in-sentencing legislation. This year, however, the General Assembly voted, mostly along party lines, to provide just one-quarter of the $400 million requested by Allen for new prison construction. <p>	    By refusing to appropriate sufficient money, Allen says, his political opponents are putting public safety at risk. "Liberals in the General Assembly," he adds, "are shortchanging prison construction, making it more likely that dangerous criminals will be released early -- and back in our neighborhoods." Allen warns that "increasing prison terms, without increasing prison capacity, is precisely the mistake that too many other states have made."<p><b>Taxes and Spending</b> <p>
	In December 1994, Allen drew fire when he proposed a relatively modest package of tax and spending cuts. Democrats attacked the governor's proposal as a tax "shift" in favor of the rich. They urged taxpayers to send $33 checks to Allen (the average amount a family's taxes would be lowered in the first year, under Allen's proposal) in an attempt to illustrate that Virginians didn't really need lower taxes. What the Democrats did not say, however, was that, by the fifth year, the average family of four, with a $30,000 income, would have saved nearly $1,000 in state taxes under Allen's proposal. Accurate or not, the Democrats' public relations campaign was successful, and the tax cut was killed. <p>	Though Allen's budget proposal cut only $170 million (out of a two-year, $15-billion general-fund budget), the Democrats tried to portray Allen's proposed budget cuts as unreasonable. For example, when Allen proposed eliminating duplicative state agricultural extension programs and high-salaried staff positions, he was erroneously accused of wanting to do away with popular 4-H agricultural programs. Similarly, when Allen targeted "family planning" programs (which were included in, of all places, the agriculture budget), he was attacked for wanting to slash farm spending. The Democrats pushed their own budget through the General Assembly on a party-line vote, restoring $166 million of Allen's spending cuts. <p>		<b>Education Reform</b><p>	During the recent session of the General Assembly, Allen proposed a new program of charter schools -- public schools controlled by teachers, universities, or other groups independent of school boards. Several bills were introduced in the General Assembly, but were killed after Democrats objected. Democratic Senator R. Edward Houck said the concept was aimed at "escaping" regulations. Houck, who is the supervisor of special and vocational education in Fredericksburg schools, denounced charter schools as a "half-baked . . . quick fix" designed to avoid what he said were the real pro
blems confronting public education -- too little money and too little parental responsibility. <p>	Allen came under heavy fire from the Democrats for his opposition to accepting $1.7 million in federal funds to implement the Clinton administration's controversial Goals 2000 program. This year, the Virginia House and Senate voted, mostly along party lines, to approve nonbinding resolutions in favor of federal funding for Goals 2000. When Republican Senator Mark Earley and others raised questions about the vague language of the federal regulations that would come attached to the money, their concerns were dismissed by the Democrats and the Virginia Education Association (VEA), a teachers union that supports Goals 2000 strongly. Allen -- expressing his concern about the need to retain local control over education in Virginia -- announced that the state would not apply for the Goals 2000 money. <p>	Other Allen proposals killed in the General Assembly included mandatory criminal background checks for new school personnel and protection of teachers from frivolous lawsuits for good-faith efforts to discipline students.<p>	The state's sex-education program, known as Family Life Education (FLE), sparked a bitter political battle. The Allen administration supported a bill that would have made FLE an "opt in" program, in which parents wanting their children to participate had to sign up. At present, the burden is on parents who do not want their children in the program to withdraw them. Because of the bureaucratic nature of the "opt out" process, some parents, who thought their children were not participating in FLE, were surprised to find their youngsters were still taking the course. The bill also would also have made FLE voluntary. Democratic opposition killed the legislation in both the House and the Senate.<p>	Allen won a partial victory on another issue: The State Board of Education voted in June to approve a compromise version of more rigorous academic standards in English, math, science, and social studies. Th
e standards were developed by the Governor's Champion Schools Commission in conjunction with parents and teachers. An earlier Allen proposal was bitterly attacked by Democratic legislators, the VEA and other teachers' groups, and a number of PTAs, who claimed the standards were "too demanding." Among other things, they required fourth-graders to be able to summarize the purpose of the Declaration of Independence and U.S. Constitution, fifth-graders to trace the historical background of major world religions, eighth-graders to identify members of the Virginia and U.S. Supreme Courts, and 12th-graders to analyze issues involving state, local and federal governments.  <p><b>Welfare</b><p>	At the beginning of this year's session, both the Democrats and the Allen administration introduced their own versions of welfare reform. Led by Senator Joseph Gartlan of Fairfax (the dean of senate liberals), the Democrats sought to cast Allen and his secretary of health and human resources, Kay James, as callously targeting the poor.<p> 	Both the House and the Senate approved weaker Democratic welfare legislation earlier this year on party-line votes. Rather than sign it, however, the governor made major changes in the bill, reflecting the details of his original proposal, and returned the measure to the General Assembly. In the end, the Democrats blinked, making just a few technical amendments to Allen's bill. The final version passed the General Assembly by overwhelming margins -- 90-9 in the House and 33-6 in the Senate -- and was signed into law by Allen. <p> 	Most provisions took effect statewide in July 1995. The plan includes a "family cap" -- denying cash benefits to children born to parents already on welfare -- and contains new rules requiring unwed teenage mothers to live with a parent or adult guardian. Welfare recipients' children will be required to attend school, and mothers on AFDC must assist the state in locating absent fathers.<p>	Tough new work requirements are at the heart of the program. The legislat
ion (which is being phased in over the next four years) requires able-bodied adult recipients to take private-sector or community service jobs within 90 days. It places a two-year limit on benefits for most recipients. To ease the transition from welfare to work, the state will provide medical services, child care, and transportation for those who find jobs.<p>	The welfare reform already seems to be having one of its intended effects: Reducing the number of able-bodied people on welfare. From 1988 to 1993, Virginia's welfare rolls increased by almost a third. By contrast, from May to July of this year, Virginia's AFDC caseload fell from 74,000 to 69,000 families. <p>	"There is a general cultural shift," says Kay James. "People were beginning to understand that change was coming, and they began to change their behavior as a result." James says recipients have been coming into local welfare offices "where the work requirements have not even been phased in, and saying: 'Look, it isn't worth it. I might as well get a job I like, instead of one you say I have to go to.'" She adds that, in meetings with Allen, local welfare administrators have frequently expressed disappointment that their areas were not among the first round of localities chosen by the administration to implement the new requirements.<p>	Despite the bipartisan votes for final passage, James believes the earlier debate over welfare in the General Assembly illustrates differences between the two parties. "In Virginia, you will hear that 'the Democrats wanted AFDC recipients to work,'" she says. "But what do you mean by 'work'? For the Democrats, that meant being involved in job trainingit didn't mean real work." In the General Assembly, she says, the Democrats pushed for "hardship exceptions" to the work requirement that were so broad that the great majority of the adult AFDC population would have been exempted. <p>	In the end, James argues, the Democrats concluded that "we were likely to prevail, and they wanted to be on that train when it left 
the station."<p><b>Federal Mandates</b><p>	Another difference between the parties involves the Allen administration's repeated clashes with the Clinton administration over federal mandates. In one case, the EPA threatened to strip Virginia of its authority to grant air pollution permits to incinerators, factories, and power plants. The agency claimed the state was in violation of federal law, because it restricted the right of private environmentalist groups to file lawsuits unless they could prove a state permit would cause them a major financial loss. <p>	Virginia later sued the EPA after the agency threatened to withhold federal highway funds. This time, the EPA refused to approve Virginia's vehicle-emissions testing plan, because the state wanted to permit gas stations to inspect and repair vehicles (Washington insisted that inspections and repairs be done at separate facilities.) <p>	Virginians are no longer willing to be "jerked around like serfs," Allen said in announcing the suit, which contends that the EPA's actions violate the 10th Amendment. This year, Allen vetoed a measure, passed by the legislature, which would have implemented the federal "motor-voter" legislation. Virginia Attorney General James Gilmore filed suit, charging the bill was an unconstitutional, unfunded federal mandate. The Justice Department and the Virginia ACLU countersued, and the case is pending.<p>	The U.S. Department of Education has ruled that Virginia public schools cannot expel or suspend disabled students for any reason without guaranteeing alternative schooling. Virginia officials say that special education students who sell drugs, carry weapons, or fight on campus should be disciplined in the same way as other students -- which may include unconditional expulsion. The education department claims this violates the federal Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, and has threatened to withhold $58 million in federal funds unless Virginia agrees to change its disciplinary procedures. <p>	Secretary James fought 
a difficult battle with Donna Shalala, Clinton's health and human services secretary, before winning a federal waiver allowing Virginia's welfare reform program to take effect. Shalala had initially demanded that Virginia directly provide child care and transportation to welfare recipients making the transition to work. Virginia fought successfully to retain the option of having the services provided by churches and other private groups. <p><b>The Moderate Republican Factor</b><p>	Even if Republicans win enough seats to form a majority, it won't necessarily mean smooth sailing for Allen's legislative proposals. Just as in the U.S. Senate, GOP moderates will tend to put up obstacles to conservative proposals. <p>	Since Allen took office last year, Republican lawmakers from Northern Virginia have, on occasion, joined with the Democrats to thwart key administration initiatives. For example, Senator Jane Woods teamed with the Democrats in working to defeat Allen's proposal to reform the FLE program. When Allen's Champion Schools Committee proposed toughened academic standards for social studies, the first draft was blasted as "an unmitigated disaster" by another Republican lawmaker, Delegate James Dillard.<p>	Delegate Vincent Callahan, one of the most senior House Republicans, joined with developer John "Til" Hazel, scores of other prominent businessmen, and Gartlan in a "bipartisan" plan to increase spending on roads, technology, and public education by hundreds of millions of dollars. The group (many of its members are Republicans) wants to pay for the new spending through a combination of new tolls, bonds, and new gas or sales taxes. It has been circulating the proposal to legislative incumbents and challengers in Northern Virginia. The plan is viewed as a slap at Allen, who has refused to consider increasing taxes.<p>	In general, Virginia voters have rarely faced as clear-cut an ideological choice between parties as they do this year. Governor Allen may have lost most of his legislative battles to date. B
ut by defining boldly what he and his party stand for, he has sharpened the issues of the election and given the citizens of the Old Dominion a set of clear choices for the direction of the state.<p>	The consequences will go beyond Virginia. If the GOP does not take a majority in at least one house of the Virginia General Assembly, then it could be premature to say America is entering a period of conservative governance. And if the Democrats lose big, their party will know that the elections of 1994 were not a fluke, and that liberal dominance of American politics may be over. <p><b>JOEL HIMELFARB</B>, <i>a Washington writer, formerly covered Virginia's legislature for the</<a href="/wash_times">i> <b>Washington Times</b> <i>editorial page</i>.

<h3>Which Land trusts Can You Trust? </h3>
<hr size=3 width=50%>
<b>R. Randolph Richardson</b><br>
<b>Policy Review</b><br>
<i>Fall 1995, Number 74</i></center>
<p>
	The public places great faith in national conservation groups to preserve ecologically valuable land. Uncritical news coverage and slick fundraising campaigns have something to do with this. But nature-lovers and property owners should be aware that local community-based land trusts are often better stewards of land and more interested in managing land for the enjoyment of the local populace. Unfortunately, many citizens involved in land preservation are unaware of the distinctions.<p>	I learned this lesson through bitter experience. My dad once owned 74 acres in Westport, Connecticut. In 1970, when he was 84, he asked me to help him decide how to preserve the land for the enjoyment and education of his neighbors. He wanted the Christmas trees he'd planted sold to help pay for planting native hardwood, shrubs, and grasses. He wanted trails with plant life identified and education programs for kids. Eventually he chose the Fairfield Chapter of the Connecticut Audubon Society (not affiliated with National Audubon) to carry out his vision because it agreed to do most of what he thought important.<p>	In l990, 18 years after Dad's death, I discovered Audubon had done nothing it had agreed to. The Christmas trees were 35 feet high and covered with thick bittersweet vines that threaten to kill them. The land was overgrown and untended, and locked gates barred public access. At the Audubon office, I pointed out that densely planted spruce trees provide almost no food and nest sites for birds (except for predatory owls and hawks that eat other birds). The young staffer ignored me and nattered on about a rare hawk seen on the site recently.<p>	Audubon's officials brazenly cited lack of funds for their failure to fulfill the contract. Yet one of the parcels was a Christmas tree farm whose profits were flowing mainly to a former Audubon employee. As far as I could see, not a penny of Audubon's share was being spent to maintain the balance of the 74 acres.<P>Over the years, I've learned that there are large differences between the practices of national landholding trusts like the Nature Conservancy, the Trust for Public Land, and National Audubon Society and those of the local trusts. There are exceptions to my generalizations, and some local and state chapters with famous brand names are not affiliated with their national namesakes, but may operate as most of the nationals do. The national environmental organizations and their affiliates tend to:<p>	Follow the thinking of John Muir, a talented nature writer and a founder of the Sierra Club. Muir believed wilderness is best left alone because man can only degrade it. The Muir doctrine, however, has no basis in science. The nationals' philosophy of land management amounts to nonmanagement. And this nonmanagement saves millions of dollars that they can devote to fundraising, salaries, perks, etc.; as the inspector general of the Interior Department points out, the nationals are businesses.<ul><p><li>	Limit public access by cutting few trails, allowing ground vegetation to become impenetrable, preserving parcels of land that are bounded entirely by private property, and declaring land off-limits under the Endangered Species Act and other federal legislation.<p><li>Lobby the federal government to manage land their way and to lock away ever more land under the Endangered Species Act, wetlands regulations, and similar laws. Many professional foresters think that such promotion of the Muir philosophy of land management results in more disastrous fires in national parks, like the notorious Yellowstone fire in 1989.<p><li>Engage in the highly profitable business of selling land to the federal government, particularly to various agencies  within the Department of the Interior (see <a href="#sidebar">sidebar</a>).</ul><p>
Local land trusts, with some exceptions, tend to:<p><ul>
<li>Use what science-based management they can afford.<p><li>Allow public access and seek multiple uses for preserved property, including recreation, preservation, education, and in some cases sensible, sustainable logging.<p><li>Seek members among their local communities. </ul><p>
	For those with experience of wildlife and land, the differences in management philosophy are not abstract. A few vignettes illustrate this. I have visited eight sites owned by nationals. Three were within homeowners' associations, forbidding public access. A fourth had soil beloved by dense ground cover, ensuring no sunlight for tree seedlings. The land could remain an impenetrable wilderness for centuries until wildfire cleared the ground. A fifth, 20.3 acres, is prone to saltwater intrusion in hurricanes and off-limits to the public. An expert on the rare orchid growing there suggested that since each plant produces 10,000-plus seeds, real protection of the species lies in trying to grow it elsewhere. Maybe Congress needs to ask that question next time it's lobbied to lock away land for an endangered something.<p>	In northeast Connecticut, by contrast, there's a young local trust busily acquiring land. Each new tract is surveyed by state or private forestry professionals. The resulting plans are masterpieces of knowledgeable, applied ecological sciences. Black birches, a disease-prone species there, are to be killed by girdling their trunks, making room for heartier stock. "Patch cuts" (small areas where trees are cleared for the planting of shrubs and grasses) are made to provide food for small mammals and to protect fledgling birds from hawks. This trust also organizes demonstrations for local landowners of some of the techniques they can apply on their land.<p>	An established trust in northwest Connecticut owns the most beautiful stand of ancient, giant hemlocks in New England. These great-grandfathers are being attacked by the wooly adelgid, an insect native to Asia that betrays its presence only when the needles start to fall off the trees. The president of the trust, a retired engineer who built petroleum plants throughout the world, has raised funds to send a scientist to Japan, where knowledge about the adelgid and its natural predators is well advanced. Many years ago, this trust had a healthy stand of red pine on ten acres. A disease, then untreatable, was devastating red pine throughout the area. The trustees decided to keep the organism from multiplying and attacking red pines elsewhere. So they clear-cut the stand and used the proceeds to improve their properties.<p>	Many things have changed since my father donated his land to the Connecticut Audubon Society. Owners have smartened up and few donors now enter into donation contracts without a strong recission clause. These legal arrangements generally recite the donor's expectations concerning the management of the gifted land: whether to allow the harvesting of mature timber, maintain trails, enforce limitations on public access, and so on.<p>	Landowners are increasingly adept at protecting the environmental integrity of their land, as well as their plans for it, by selling conservation easements to land trusts. Such easements, which last in perpetuity, essentially foreclose any chance that the owners' wishes will not be respected. One can sell an easement, for example, requiring that the land be managed a certain way and cannot be sold for development. There's been an explosion in the variety of easement terms; with patience, a landowner may find an organization that buys easements allowing the harvesting of mature timber or providing expert management for wildlife and plants. If the transfer is to take place after the donor's death, the authority to enforce the recission power is frequently conveyed to a third party known as the enforcer, whose rights, responsibilities, and qualifications can be written into the contract.<p><b>Looking to the Future</b><p>	The last 15 years or so have witnessed an explosion in the number of small, community-based local trusts. According to the Land Trust Alliance, based in Washington, D.C., as of 1994 there were 1,100 land trusts with approximately 900,000 active members. The number of local trusts is now growing at about one per week. They own about 540,000 acres outright, have conveyed nearly 1 million acres to state and municipal parks, and have acquired various kinds of conservation easements on about 2.5 million acres.<p>I would like to imagine a future in which the practices of national landholding organizations converge with those of local trusts for the betterment of citizens and communities. Change is already occurring among the nationals. In most Northeastern and Western states, state and county forestry officials are products of excellent forestry schools. They understand the science-based management of wild land and wildlife. They advise the local trusts and, occasionally, the local affiliates of the nationals.<p>	The 1991 Farm Bill included funding for a "Forestry Stewardship Program" that strengthens the advisory system local trusts and private owners depend on. Here and there, some local affiliates of the nationals are beginning to use science to manage their land. In most areas, relations between the locals and the nationals are cordial and the practices introduced by state and private foresters are being observed by the young idealists who work for national affiliates. In sum, science is once again beginning to overcome what has increasingly seemed a dogma.<p><b>R. RANDOLPH RICHARDSON</B>, <i>now retired, has run several small businesses in the timber, cattle-raising, farming, and fishing industries</i>.<p><a name="sidebar"></a><b>Real Estate for Sale (sidebar)</b><p>	My desire to see local land trusts receive the support they deserve is not limited to my experiences as a landowner and a conservationist. As a taxpayer, I have become concerned about the practice by national land trusts of purchasing ecologically valuable land from private owners for the purpose of reselling it to federal agencies. Taxpayers should hold government accountable for wise use of funds and tax exemptions, especially when the result is often to remove land from public access. Yet the federal government often overpays, to the enrichment of the national trusts involved. According to a 1992 report of the Interior Department's inspector general:<p><ul>
<li>Between 1987 and 1989, the Fish and Wildlife Service paid the Nature Conservancy $13.5 million for 11,502 Texas acres, including $500,000 paid in undocumented fees that boosted the price above market value. The same agency paid the same seller $4.5 million for Oklahoma land appraised at $3.5 million.<p>
<li>In 1987, Fish and Wildlife paid the National Audubon Society $1 million for 777 acres in California appraised at $700,000. The agency reasoned that it had asked Audubon to acquire the land in 1983, when Audubon had to pay $1 million for it.<p>
<li>The Nature Conservancy purchased 3,735 Arkansas acres in 1989. In 1991, Fish and Wildlife bought 1,153 acres of this appraised at $747,000 for $914,000, including interest and overhead charges of $251,000.

<h3>How Nurses Can Help Relieve Spiraling Heath-Care Costs</h3>
<hr size=3 width=50%>
<b><a href="http://www.cato.org/main/bandow.html">Doug Bandow</a></b><br>
<b>Policy Review</b><br>
<i>Fall 1995, Number 74</i></center><p>
	Medicare isn't the only part of America's health-care system where costs are spiraling out of control. Doctors have created a cartel by confining the delivery of treatment solely to M.D.s and by regulating the number and activities of M.D.s. This suppresses the supply of health-care professionals, raising costs and reducing choice. State governments could significantly lower both public and private health-care costs by reducing physicians' stranglehold over medical care and moving towards a freer market. For its part, the federal government could, if it is willing to use its vast power under the commerce clause of the Constitution, preempt state rules that hamper the cost-effective delivery of medical services.<p>	The Clinton administration recognized the problem of supply, but sought to remedy it by manipulating federal funding to force more doctors to become general practitioners. Similarly, the Council on Graduate Medical Education has urged educational changes to change the ratio of primary-care physicians to specialists from 30:70 to 50:50 by the year 2040.<p>	The critical question, however, is not what percentage of doctors should provide primary care, but who should be allowed to provide primary care. Doctors are not the only professionals qualified to treat patients, yet most states needlessly restrict the activities of advanced-practice nurses (A.P.N.s) (who include nurse practitioners, nurse-midwives, clinical nurse specialists, and nurse anesthetists), registered nurses (R.N.s), licensed practical nurses (L.P.N.s), physicians assistants (P.A.s), nurse's aides, and similar professionals. Even today, these providers dramatically outnumber doctorsthere are 2.2 million R.N.s, three times the number of M.D.s, and nearly 1 million L.P.N.s alone, while the number of A.P.N.s, at well over 100,000, is about half the number of physicians providing primary care. Ellen Sanders, a vice-president of the American Nurses Association, estimates that 300,000 R.N.s could become A.P.N.s with an additional year or tw
o of training.<p>	Although A.P.N.s, R.N.s, and L.P.N.s are capable of handling many simple and routine health care procedures, most states, at the behest of physicians, allow only M.D.s to perform "medical acts." According to Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics at the University of Minnesota, "You have highly trained people doing things that could be done by others." Doctors perform what A.P.N.s could do, A.P.N.s do what registered nurses could handle, and registered nurses handle what nurse's aides could perform. "I can take care of a patient who has broken an arm," complains Maddy Wiley, a nurse practitioner in Washington state, "treat them from top to bottom, but I can't give them an adequate painkiller." Instead, patients can receive such treatment only through the government-created doctors' oligopoly, into which entry is tightly restricted. Observes Michael Tanner of the Cato Institute: "In most states, nurse practitioners cannot treat a patient without direct physician supervision. Chiropractors cannot order blood tests or CAT scans. Nurses, psychologists, pharmacists, and other practitioners cannot prescribe even the most basic medications."<p>	The problem is exacerbated by the nature of the medical marketplace, where the expansion of services is expensive. Much of the necessary capital already exists -- there are, for instance, a lot of unfilled hospital beds. The practice of medicine, however, has become increasingly labor intensive. The National Center for Policy Analysis figures that, because of the high cost of training medical personnel, "moving capital and labor from other sectors requires a price increase for medical services that is six times higher than that needed to expand other goods and services." As a result, the NCPA estimates, 57 cents of every additional dollar in U.S. medical expenditures is eaten away by higher prices rather than added services.<p>	Physicians have shown unyielding resistance to alternative professionals. Medical societies have tried to prev
ent chiropractors, for instance, from gaining privileges at local hospitals. M.D.s have similarly opposed osteopaths and podiatrists. Working through state legislatures, physicians have won statutory protection from competition. Many states ban midwives from handling deliveries. Optometrists are usually barred from such simple acts as prescribing eye drops. Half of the states permit only physicians to perform acupuncture. Overregulation of pharmaceuticals, which prevents patients from self-medicating, also acts as a limit on health-care competition. Allowing over-the-counter sales of penicillin, for instance, could save patients about $1 billion annually.<p>	A recent episode in Georgia illustrates the arbitrariness of most occupational licensure regulations. According to Tanner, state legislation was introduced at the behest of dentists to prevent dental hygienists from cleaning teeth. Then an amendment was added for the ophthalmologists to bar optometrists from performing laser eye surgery. In the end, the bill prohibited anyone but physicians, veterinarians, podiatrists, and dentists from performing any procedure that pierced the skin, effectively outlawing nurses from drawing blood or giving injections. This unintended outcome would have brought most hospitals to a halt, and a court had to block its enforcement. Examples abound of legal restrictions promoted by self-serving professionals and harmful to consumers. In general, professional licensure has reduced the number of potential caregivers, cut the time spent with patients, and raised prices.<p>	The second manifestation of physicians' monopoly power is the anticompetitive restrictions that the profession places upon itself. The doctors' lobby has helped drive proprietary medical schools out of business, reduced the inflow of new M.D.s, and for years prevented advertising and discouraged members of local medical associations from joining prepaid plans. Until the early 1980s, the American Medical Association attempted to restrict walk-in clinics that adv
ertised themselves as providing "emergency" or "urgent" care. Explained John Coury, who was then chairman of the AMA, "Some of these facilities were set up by nonmedical people as money-making propositions" -- as if doctors don't seek to make money. Moreover, federal immigration law and state requirements limit the entry of foreign doctors into the country and often prevent them from finding work. None of these rules has much to do with consumer protection.<p>	Allowing nurses to provide services for which they are qualified would expand people's options, allowing patients to decide on the more cost-effective course of their treatment. Some states have begun to allow greater competition among health-care providers. Mississippi does not regulate the practice of P.A.s. Nearly half the states, including New York, already allow nurse practitioners to write at least some prescriptions, while a handful, such as Oregon and Washington, give A.P.N.s significant autonomy. The Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services is encouraging the training of nurse-midwives.<p>	In this area, at least, the Clinton administration wanted to move in the right direction, pledging to "remove inappropriate barriers to practice." The Clinton proposal would have eliminated state laws that ban A.P.N.s from offering primary careprenatal services, immunizations, prescription of medication, treatment of common health problems, and management of chronic but standard conditions like asthma -- and to receive insurance reimbursement for such services. Even these modest efforts did not go unchallenged: The California Medical Association attacked the Clintons' proposal as "dangerous to the public's health," and an AMA report argued that expanding the role of nurses would hurt patients, fragment the delivery of care, and even raise costs.<p>	There is, however, no evidence that the public health would be threatened by allowing non-M.D.s to do more. Professionals should be allowed to perform work for which they are well trained -- witho
ut direct supervision by a doctor. At the very least, states should relax restrictions in regions, particularly rural areas, that have difficulty in attracting physicians. In this way, those with few health-care options could choose to seek treatment from professionals with less intensive training. A recent Gallup poll found that 86 percent of Americans would accept a nurse as their primary-care practitioner. Why not give them that option? Says Leah Binder of the National League of Nursing, "Let the 'invisible hand' determine how much it should cost to get a primary-care checkup."<p>	 Physicians assistants, for instance, receive two years of instruction to work directly for doctors and could perform an estimated 80 percent of the primary-care tasks conducted by doctors, such as taking medical histories, performing physical exams, and ordering tests. Similarly, the Office of Technology Assessment figures that nurses with advanced practices could provide 60 to 80 percent of the clinical services now reserved for doctors. Explains Arthur Caplan of the University of Minnesota, nurse practitioners are "an underutilized, untapped resource that could help reduce the cost of health care significantly." Len Nichols, a Wellesley economist, estimates that removing restrictions on A.P.N.s could save between $6.4 billion and $8.8 billion annually. Mary Mundinger, the dean of Columbia University's School of Nursing, contends that nurse practitioners have been providing primary care for decades and no research, even that conducted by doctors, has ever documented any problems.<p>	Lonnie Bristow, the chairman of the AMA, admits as much, but responds that those nurses were working under a doctor's supervision. But that supervision is often quite loose. Nurses regularly perform many simple aspects of primary care far more often than doctors and, as a result, are better qualified to handle them in the future, with or without the supervision of an M.D.<p>	None of the AMA's arguments withstands analysis. For instance, the officia
l AMA report claims that because nurses want to serve all populations and not just "underserved" groups in rural and inner-city areas, "there is virtually no evidence to support" the claim that empowering other medical professionals would improve access to care. But increasing the quantity of primary health-care providers would necessarily make additional medical professionals available to every area. Moreover, poor rural communities would likely be better able to afford the services of A.P.N.s, whose median salary nationwide is $43,600, than a general-practice M.D.s, with a median salary of $119,000. Even if allowing nurses to do more increased competition only in wealthier areas, it would thereby encourage some medical professionals, including doctors, to consider moving to underserved regions where the competition is less intense.<p>	The most compelling argument against relaxing restrictions on nurses is that Americans' health care might somehow suffer. "A nurse with four to six years of education after high school does not have the same training, experience, or knowledge base as a physician who has 11 to 16 years," complains Daniel Johnson, the Speaker of the AMA's House of Delegates. True enough, but so what? No one is suggesting that nurses do anything but the tasks nurses are trained to do. In fact, the OTA study judged A.P.N. care in a dozen medical areas to be better than that of M.D.s.<p>	The problem of occupational licensure is not confined to doctors. The nursing profession behaves the same way when it has a chance. Under severe cost pressures, hospitals have increasingly been relying on L.P.N.s, nurse's aides, and "patient-care assistants." The cost savings can be great: Nurses typically receive two to four times as much training as licensed practical nurses and command salaries 50 percent greater. Yet in many hospitals they still bathe and feed patients. Stanford University Hospital has saved $25 million over the last five years by reducing the share of R.N.s among patient-care employees from 90
 percent to 60 percent. The consulting firm of APM, Inc. claims that, since 1987, it has assisted 80 hospitals in saving some $1 billion. Alas, professional groups like the American Nurses Association have opposed these efforts.<p>	To bring competition to the medical profession, patients should also be allowed greater access to practitioners of unorthodox medicine. In 1990, a tenth of Americans -- primarily well-educated and middle- to upper-income -- went to chiropractors, herbal healers, massage therapists, and the like. Health insurance covered few such treatments. Some of these procedures may seem spurious, but then, practices like acupuncture were once regarded similarly before gaining credibility. The most important principle is to allow patients free choice to determine the medical treatments they wish to receive. This means relaxing legal restrictions on unconventional practitioners and creating a health-insurance system that would allow those inclined toward alternative treatments to acquire policies tailored to their preferences.<p>	Most important, states should address the obstacles to becoming and practicing as an M.D. This nation suffers from an artificial limit on physicians. Observes Andrew Dolan of the University of Washington, the argument that occupational licensing is necessary "to protect patients against shoddy care" is "unproven by almost any standard." Experience suggests that licensure reflects professional rather than consumer interests.<p>	At the least, states should eliminate the most anti-competitive aspects of the licensing framework, particularly barriers to qualifying as doctors and to competition. These include that power of doctors to control entry into their own profession and to restrict competitive practices. As the National Center for Policy Analysis's John Goodman and Gerald Musgrave explain, "Virtually every law designed to restrict the practice of medicine was enacted not on the crest of widespread public demand but because of intense pressure from the political repres
entatives of physicians." Although licensure is defended as necessary to protect patients, local medical societies spent years fighting practices (such as advertising, discounting, and prepaid plans) that served patients' interests, as well as imposing fixed-fee schedules on their members. No existing licensing requirement should escape critical review.<p>	More far-reaching reform proposals include substituting institutional licensure of hospitals and establishing a genuine free market in health care (backed by private certification and testing and continuing malpractice liability). Such approaches seem shocking today only in the context of the vast regulatory structure that has been erected over the years. If we are serious about increasing access to and reducing the expense of medical care, we should give careful consideration to full deregulation. Such steps would do much to achieve the Clinton administration's goal of encouraging more primary-care physicians and more physicians from racial minorities.<p>	The federal government shares some of the blame for clogging the pipeline of medical professionals, because its Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement rules encourage needlessly large and over-trained medical staffs. Medicare, for instance, requires hospitals to use only licensed laboratory and radiological technicians, and engage a registered nurse to provide or supervise the nursing in every department. Only nurse practitioners operating in nursing homes or rural areas can be reimbursed under Medicare. Only 18 states allow Medicaid reimbursement for A.P.N.s. Non-hospital facilities such as community health centers, which play a particularly important role in poor and rural areas, also face tough staffing requirements. These sort of restrictions hamper the shift to less expensive outpatient services. With enough political will, the federal government could play a role in easing state licensure, just as the Federal Trade Commission fought professional strictures against advertising.<p>The collapse of the Cl
inton campaign for radical reform was welcome, but the American medical system still needs fixing. The supply side would be a good place to start. Rising costs require us to look for cost-effective alternative providers. Even more important: Patients should have the largest possible range of options when determining their health care. It's time to integrate the practice of medicine into the market economy. <p><b><a href="http://www.cato.org/main/bandow.html">DOUG BANDOW</a></B> <i>is a senior fellow at the <a href="http://www.cato.org">Cato Institute</a> and the author of</i> <b>The Politics of Envy: Statism as Theology</b>.

<h2>REFORMING AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IN EMPLOYMENT: <br>
HOW TO RESTORE THE LAW OF EQUAL TREATMENT</h2>

Nelson Lund is Associate Professor of Law at the George Mason
University School of Law. From 1989 to 1992, Professor Lund served
as Associate Counsel to President George Bush. Before that, he
served as law clerk to Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor
and Attorney-Advisor in the Office of Legal Counsel in the Department
of Justice.
<P>
<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<P>
 In his recent speech on affirmative action programs, President
Clinton strongly reaffirmed the federal government's long-standing,
and thoroughly discredited, approach to this subject. That approach
is easy to sum up: Proclaim a fervid opposition to discrimination,
but practice a policy of discriminatory preferences and favoritism
for selected groups. The euphemisms and Orwellian doublespeak
by now are quite familiar:
<P>
President Clinton's embrace of the discriminatory status quo puts
the burden on Congress to initiate meaningful reform. Such reform
must address three principal areas in which the federal government
practices or fosters discriminatory preferences: contract set-asides,
education, and employment. Congress in all likelihood will consider
the following three options.
<P>
<B>OPTION 1: Put the federal government's own house in order.</B>
This approach, which has been embraced by Senate Majority Leader
Bob Dole (R-KS) and Representative Charles Canady (R-FL), would
dismantle the notorious system of minority and sex-based quotas
for federal contracts and forbid the federal government from discriminating
in hiring and promotions. Federal contract set-asides increase
the cost of government procurement by preventing agencies from
accepting the low bids on many contracts, and they discriminate
against low-bidding firms that are owned by people of the wrong
color or sex. Abolishing this practice would be a significant
step in the right direction by establishing a level playing field
for the more than $161 billion in federal contracts awarded annually. (1) 
Abolishing discriminatory practices in federal hiring and promotions,
moreover, would substitute individual merit for group status and
give equal legal rights to more than 2.8 million federal employees.

<P>
  The limits of this approach, however, are evident from Chart
1, which shows that the federal government employs only 3.1 percent
of the workers now protected by the principal anti-discrimination
statute. Federal contractors, moreover, would still be allowed
to use discriminatory preferences, and Labor Department bureaucrats
could still bring pressure for "better numbers," so
long as they avoided the imposition of formal goals and timetables.
And discriminatory preferences in college admissions would be
virtually untouched. 
<P>
<B> OPTION 2: Outlaw discriminatory preferences imposed not only
by the federal government, but also by federal contractors and
subcontractors, and by state and local level governments and other
recipients of federal grants.</B> Although this is not a complete
solution, it would extend the principle of equal treatment to
an additional 26.5 million employees of firms that do business
with the federal government and the approximately 16 million Americans
who work for state and local governments. (2) And it would cover practically
all colleges and universities. This approach adopts the well-accepted
principle that the federal government should neither engage in
discrimination nor finance discriminatory conduct by others. That
principle has been applied for many years to protect women and
certain minorities from discrimination by those who do business
with the federal government or who accept federal financial assistance.
<P>
 But, again, this approach leaves something to be desired. Under
this approach, it would still be legal to discriminate against
half of those Americans currently covered by the federal civil
rights law.
<P>
<B> OPTION 3: Require equal treatment for 100 percent of the population
that is now covered by federal civil rights law.</B> The most
complete solution is also the simplest. The Civil Rights Act of
1964 clearly forbade employment discrimination against either
sex and against any racial or ethnic group. Although federal agencies
and the courts have refused to implement Congress's straightforward
mandate, the Congress can now insist that its original intent
be honored. This would extend the principle of equal treatment
to the more than 94 million American employees now covered by
the 1964 Act. Similarly, racial discrimination by federal grantees
 -- which includes almost all colleges and universities  --  has
been formally forbidden for thirty years. Congress need only insist
that this law be enforced as written.
<P>
 This study explains in some detail why Congress should opt for
a comprehensive approach to the problem of discriminatory preferences
in employment. After exploring the illegitimate origins of the
current system, it discusses the nature of the current problem
and explains why partial solutions are unsatisfactory. It also
unmasks the myths behind "voluntary" affirmative action
and the "disparate impact" theory of discrimination.
Finally, it offers an outline of the legislation Congress ought
to consider if it wants to restore the ideal of equal treatment
under the law. 
<P>
<h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
<P>
 The Congress of the United States has never sanctioned the discriminatory
conduct that now occurs routinely in the American workplace under
the rubric of "affirmative action." To the contrary,
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawed discrimination
in employment against any individual "because of such individual's
race, color, religion, sex, or national origin." Senator
Hubert H. Humphrey (D-MN), who was the Democratic floor manager
for the 1964 Act, assured the Senate that "nothing in the
bill would permit any official or court to require any employer
or labor union to give preferential treatment to any minority
group." (3) Even more dramatically, Humphrey challenged one skeptical
colleague by saying:
<P>
<blockquote> If the Senator can find in title VII... any language which provides
that an employer will have to hire on the basis of percentage
or quota related to color... I will start eating the pages one
after another, because it is not in there. (4)</blockquote>
<P>
 Technically, Senator Humphrey was right. But federal judges and
bureaucrats soon proved him wrong by using Title VII to create
the elaborate system of quotas and preferences that we see all
around us today. This transformation was accomplished through
a series of Orwellian distortions of the law, none of which has
ever been ratified by Congress.
<P>
 Congress can solve all the important problems arising from affirmative
action in the workplace by emphatically reaffirming the law it
enacted in 1964. This would have the effect of repealing the complicated
system of racial and sex-based preferences that have proliferated
thanks to rogue judges and regulators. Congress must understand
that these problems cannot be solved simply by getting the federal
government itself out of the business of discrimination. The most
serious effects of the federal government's twisted interpretation
of Title VII are occurring in the private sector and in state
and local government. Unless Congress addresses those effects,
any claim of leadership will ring hollow indeed.
<P>
<h4>UNDERSTANDING AFFIRMATIVE DISCRIMINATION</h4>
<P>
 Group-based employment preferences are incompatible with the
ideal of equal opportunity that every federal employment statute
has claimed to advance. They are also incompatible with the views
of the overwhelming majority of Americans. (5) For the same reasons
that Congress has quietly accepted the insidious spread of such
preferences, however, it will be reluctant to abolish them. Powerful
special interests, ranging from civil rights lobbyists and labor
unions to significant elements of the business world, will ferociously
defend the discriminatory status quo. Legislators who make their
stand on the principles articulated by Hubert Humphrey and Martin
Luther King, Jr., will be accused of racism, insensitivity, and
political expediency. As a consequence, true expediency may tempt
them to soften the rougher edges in the current system through
cosmetic reforms and empty symbolism, leaving the underlying problem
unresolved.
<P>
 One common perception about affirmative action is that it began
as a benign effort to combat discrimination and has evolved gradually
into the current system of quotas and preferences. Affirmative
action, according to this view, simply requires employers to "cast
a wider net" so that members of historically neglected groups
can enjoy the opportunity to compete on an equal footing for jobs
and promotions. While there is some truth in this view, there
also are indications that it was no accident that "affirmative
action" became a device for smuggling legalized preferences
into the fabric of American life.
<P>
 In September 1965, for example, President Lyndon B. Johnson issued
an executive order requiring federal contractors to agree that
they would take "affirmative action to ensure that applicants
are employed, and that employees are treated during employment,
without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin." (6) 
This sounds perfectly innocuous. Only a few months earlier, however,
Johnson had said that "equality of opportunity is essential,
but not enough." What was really required, according to Johnson,
was a transition to "the next and the more profound stage
of the battle for civil rights.... We seek not just legal equity
but human ability, not just equality as a right and a theory but
equality as a fact <I>and equality as a result.</I>" (7) 
<P>
 Whatever the original vision of affirmative action may have been,
it soon became a tool for imposing equality of results rather
than equality of opportunity. While federal law on its face forbids
discrimination against members of any racial group or either sex,
this apparently simple principle has been obscured and twisted
by a complex web of lies, censorship, doublespeak, and code words.
Those whom the law now disfavors can be denied a job or promotion
because of their skin color or their sex without being victims
of "discrimination" in its new legal meaning. This miracle
is accomplished by calling the denial either (a) affirmative action
taken to <I>prevent</I> discrimination; (b) an unfortunate side
effect of an attempt to cure "historic injustices";
(c) a prerequisite to achieving "diversity in the workplace";
or (d) the result of a presumption of "social disadvantage"
for everyone in the preferred racial group. 
<P>
  The dizzying and ever-changing array of intellectual rationales
for discrimination has been accompanied by an elaborate code of
misleading language. Quotas become "measurable goals and
specific timetables." When a job applicant is rejected because
of race, it was not really because of his race: it was just that
the favored person had <I>his</I> race counted as a "plus
factor." Or discrimination isn't really bad unless it is
also "stigmatizing" (an effect that apparently can be
experienced only by certain legally favored groups). All of this
evasive rhetoric has arisen because the underlying practices are
so difficult to defend. And because of that difficulty, they are
rarely defended. Instead, they often are just carried out covertly.
But the discriminatory nature of affirmative action cannot be
concealed entirely. 
<P>
 Example: A 1989 poll of <I>Fortune</I> 500 executives indicated
that only 14 percent of these firms even claimed to eschew discriminatory
preferences in favor of merit-based hiring decisions. A majority
of the firms claimed to employ "affirmative action goals,"
and a full 18 percent acknowledged that they have adopted specific
quotas. (8)
<P>
Example: In 1990, Max Frankel, who was then executive editor of
<I>The New York Times</I>, acknowledged that the standard of excellence
that his organization applied to employees depended upon the individual's
skin color:
<P>
 <blockquote>We've reached a critical mass with women. I know that when a
woman screws up it is not a political act for me to go fire them.
I cannot (easily) say that with some of our blacks. They're still
precious, they're still hothouse in management, and if they are
less than good, I would probably stay my hand at removing them
too quickly. It's still a political act and it would hurt the
organization in a larger sense, so you tolerate a little more
in the short term. (9)</blockquote>
<P>
 
<P>
Example: The state of California enacted a law setting a goal
that "by fiscal year 1992-93, 30 percent of all new hires
in the California Community Colleges as a system will be ethnic
minorities." (10)
<P>
Example: After the <I>Philadelphia Inquirer </I>was criticized
for an editorial advocating that poor black women be encouraged
to use the contraceptive Norplant, the paper's editor announced
a quota of 50 percent minorities and 50 percent women for all
newsroom hires during the succeeding five years. (11)
<P>
Example: The Xerox Corporation has adopted a kind of "hidden
hand" alternative to quotas: Annual bonuses are based in
part on a manager's success in promoting blacks and women. (12)
<P>
Example: The Washington Bureau chief of the <I>Los Angeles Times</I>
has announced that no white males will be hired "until we
[do] more for minorities and women." (13)
<P>
Example: Apparently seeking to increase the "diversity"
of its workforce by hiring more women, the U.S. Forest Service's
Pacific Southwest Region created "upward mobility positions"
limited to "applicants who do not meet the [Office of Personnel
Management] qualifications requirements." A Forest Service
spokesman defended its amazing search for <I>unqualified</I> workers
with the following revealing comment: "On its face, this
seems bizarre. However, the intent  if not the choice of language
 was appropriate to the circumstances.... " (14)
<P>
Example: On January 20, 1995, Oklahoma City decided to withdraw
from the U.S. Department of Justice's Police Hiring Supplement
Grant program, under which it had been authorized to hire 25 officers.
Police Chief Sam Gonzales objected to a Justice Department letter
that demanded an "underutilization analysis" for women
and minorities and an affirmative action plan including specific
steps to achieve "goals" for correcting the underutilization
that the Justice Department <I>assumed must exist</I>. Justice
Department officials also demanded that the city develop a specific
plan for the "equal employment of women and minorities within
the Police Department's sworn personnel." Chief Gonzales
commented: "I believe this particular language to be very
significant in that it states `equal employment' of women and
minorities rather than `equal employment opportunity.'" (15)
<P>
<h4>B>THE ILLEGITIMATE SOURCES OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION</h4>
<P>
 The main goal of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was to dismantle
the Jim Crow system, under which black Americans were pervasively,
overtly, and legally discriminated against in substantial portions
of the nation. The prohibition against employment discrimination
in Title VII of that statute was meant to enhance the economic
well-being of this oppressed minority by requiring employers to
give blacks the same opportunities available to whites. That goal
was achieved: Jim Crow was destroyed, and economic progress among
southern blacks increased dramatically during the decade following
the enactment of Title VII. (16)
<P>
 Although the motivating force for the Civil Rights Act was opposition
to the legalized oppression of Jim Crow, Congress did not stop
there. Following a long American tradition, exemplified by the
Fourteenth Amendment itself, the legislature established universal
legal rights that apply everywhere in the country. Significantly,
Title VII contains no special provisions for blacks, and no special
provisions for the South. The concept of "protected groups"
is alien to the fundamental principles of Title VII, which establishes
individual rights belonging to every employee and applicant for
employment. (17)
<P>
 Although it rested on universal principles, Title VII originally
included exemptions for certain entities, most notably small employers
and government agencies. The original statute also provided exceptions
for certain kinds of traditional practices, such as treating men
and women differently where sex is a "bona fide occupational
qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation"
of a business. (18) Subsequent acts of Congress expanded the reach
of the statute to cover state and federal agencies (19), as well as
some small employers exempted in the original Act and certain
forms of unintentional discrimination. The law has also been amended
to increase the powers of the principal enforcement agency (the
Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) and to enlarge the monetary
relief that victims can recover from defendants.
<P>
 Not once, however, has Congress created any "affirmative
action" exception to Title VII's prohibition against discrimination. (20)
The exceptions that have arisen are entirely the product of executive
and judicial action.
<P>
<h4>QUOTAS BY EXECUTIVE ORDER</h4>
<P>
Pursuant to executive orders issued by Presidents Kennedy and
Johnson, the Department of Labor undertook the most important
early initiatives promoting illegitimate forms of affirmative
action. These initiatives were not dictated by the executive orders
themselves, which required only that federal contractors "take
affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and
that employees are treated during employment, without regard to
their race, creed, color, or national origin." (21) In light of
the long-standing patterns of racial discrimination that existed
at the time, especially in the South and in certain unionized
industries, this language implied no more than that firms wishing
to do business with the federal government should resist the strong
inertial forces supporting those odious practices. But this unexceptionable
goal was soon left behind.
<P>
 Early in the Nixon Administration, the Labor Department quietly
promulgated an order requiring that "the rate of minority
applicants recruited should approximate or equal the ratio of
minorities to the applicant population in each location." (22) 
After an outcry against this proportional representation scheme,
the order was replaced with a more subtly worded set of rules
that nonetheless had the effect of requiring racial quotas and
preferences. Under the current version of these rules, federal
contractors must establish numerical "goals and timetables"
(one of many popular euphemisms for quotas) whenever minorities
are "underutilized" according to arbitrary standards
that do not measure actual discrimination. (23) Enforced by the Office
of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) in the Labor Department,
these rules give OFCCP the power to issue debarment orders forbidding
federal agencies from doing business with firms that show insufficient
zeal in meeting their quotas. Needless to say, the threat of debarment
has powerful <I>in terrorem</I> effects.
<P>
<h4>JUDICIAL AUTHORIZATION OF QUOTAS</h4>
<P>
Had the federal courts enforced the plain meaning and intent of
Title VII, the arbitrary quota policies promoted by the Nixon
Administration and its successors might have withered on the vine.
In <I>United Steelworkers v. Weber</I> (24), however, the Supreme Court
held that racial quotas are permissible under Title VII. The case
arose when Kaiser Aluminum and the United Steelworkers adopted
a collective bargaining agreement establishing a training program
that would qualify unskilled Kaiser workers for jobs in various
skilled trades. Eligibility for the program was determined by
seniority, but Kaiser succumbed to pressure from the Labor Department
and imposed a 50 percent quota for black applicants. (25) While acknowledging
in his majority opinion that the language of Title VII's prohibition
against discrimination "because of race" plainly forbade
this affirmative action program, Justice Brennan nevertheless
pretended that Congress intended something other than what the
statute says. He was unable, however, to find a single shred of
evidence to support this position. Justice Rehnquist's dissenting
opinion, by way of contrast, assembled a massive array of evidence
conclusively refuting Brennan's audacious misinterpretation.
<P>
 In <I>Johnson v. Transportation Agency</I> (26), the Supreme Court
affirmed and expanded the affirmative action exception to Title
VII. Employers in both the public and the private sectors now
face pressure to grant discriminatory preferences when there is
a "manifest imbalance" of minorities or women in "traditionally
segregated job categories." Despite what one might think
from reading this language, however, affirmative action is not
limited to rectifying segregationist practices by discriminatory
employers. Rather, discrimination is legitimized whenever women
or minorities are "underrepresented" in some job. The
standards for determining "underrepresentation" are
extremely loose, and have been met even when it has been caused
by some vague and unspecified form of "societal discrimination." (27)
<P>
 With perfect circular reasoning, "discrimination" is
presumed to exist when "underrepresentation" in particular
jobs is found.
<P>
<h4>INNOCENT VICTIMS OF QUOTA POLICIES</h4>
<P>
The Supreme Court has also stated that legitimate affirmative
action plans must not "unnecessarily trammel the interests
of the [disfavored] employees." (28) Here again, however, the
Court permits employers to impose explicit racial quotas even
when those quotas offer no relief to victims of proven discrimination. (29)
<P>
 Quotas and preferences, moreover, are legal even when they deny
employment opportunities to individuals who have never benefited
from an employer's prior discrimination.
<P>
 The <I>Weber</I> decision is once again illustrative. The white
plaintiff in that case, an unskilled laborer, had never belonged
to one of the unions whose racist policies had presumably excluded
blacks from the skilled trades. Yet the Court upheld a discriminatory
quota that deprived this plaintiff of an opportunity that would
have been open to him but for the color of his skin. While in
theory there are limits to how far employers can go in trammeling
the interests of people in disfavored groups, (30) in practice, the
Supreme Court has never held that an affirmative action plan violates
Title VII. In fact, the Court has created a legal rule that presumes
the validity of discriminatory affirmative action plans, thus
requiring victims to assume the heavy burden of <I>disproving</I>
the validity of such plans. (31)
<P>
 With the law stacked so heavily against them, victims of affirmative
action policies seldom seek legal redress. The reported decisions
therefore do not present anything like a true picture of the underlying
problem. It is completely absurd to argue, as one Clinton Administration
consultant has contended, that the paucity of reported judicial
decisions means that "the problem of 'reverse discrimination'
is not widespread; and that where it exists, the courts have given
relief." (32) One might as well argue that the paucity of litigation
about employment discrimination in the 1950s meant that discrimination
against blacks was a rarity. (33)
<P>
 Although reported cases are not especially numerous, a few examples
offer some insight into the sort of policies that courts find
acceptable.
<P>
Example: A county agency, which had never discriminated against
women, adopted an affirmative action plan with a "goal"
of 36.4 percent women (corresponding to the proportion of women
in the county's workforce) on highway maintenance crews. Despite
the utterly obvious fact that women are less likely than men to
seek jobs involving heavy physical labor, the Supreme Court labeled
this a "traditionally segregated job category." The
Court approved the county's decision to deny a promotion to a
male applicant in favor of a less qualified woman. (34)
<P>
Example: After receiving the highest score on a competitive examination,
a white firefighter was denied a promotion to engineer in favor
of a black firefighter with a lower score. Without discussing
the percentage of blacks in the fire department or in the engineer
position, and without making any comparisons with the available
labor force, the federal courts discovered a "manifest imbalance"
in a traditionally segregated job category. In upholding the fire
department's racial discrimination, the appellate court commented,
in words that could have been applied as easily to Jim Crow itself,
that the affirmative action plan "minimizes the disruption
of employees' expectations by providing clear guidelines for when
race may be taken into account." (35)
<P>
Example: In approving a plan to increase the number of women in
a university sociology department by discriminating against male
applicants, a federal court held, apparently with a straight face,
that "[w]hen approximately fifty percent of the nation's
population is women and only thirty-four percent of the recipients
of Ph.D.'s in sociology are women, sociology must be considered
to be a traditionally segregated field." (36)
<P>
Example: A county school board approved a policy involving race-based
involuntary transfers of teachers among schools. The courts acknowledged
that the challenged policy "does classify and burden individual
teachers on the basis of race." Although the policy had been
adopted in connection with a desegregation case, there were no
vestiges of discrimination in faculty assignments. The courts
nonetheless upheld the discriminatory policy "because the
goal of providing to schoolchildren a racially diverse learning
environment is clearly a legitimate one under Title VII." (37)
<P>
Example: A court approved a university's decision to raise the
salaries of women faculty members by amounts ranging from 1 percent
to 40 percent. The school's decision was based on a statistical
study showing that women were paid less than "comparable"
men. The comparability study, however, took no account of variables
such as "research productivity and quality, teaching quality
and load, publication quantity and community service" because
such variables generally "are not available and/or not suitable
for statistical analysis compared to the relatively straightforward
coding of other factors such as rank or tenure status." Thus,
nondiscriminatory factors that could obviously create salary disparities
were ignored because the court did not have any numbers handy
with which to measure them. (38)
<P>
<h4>THE SCOPE AND NATURE OF EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION</h4></B>
<P>
 Any honest discussion about the prevalence of employment discrimination
must begin with two propositions. First, no one knows or can know
how much discrimination against any group actually occurs. Second,
no law can eliminate such discrimination completely.
<P>
 There simply have been no reliable studies measuring either how
much discrimination American employers actually engage in or against
whom they discriminate the most. We can be sure of one thing,
however: discrimination against virtually all groups does occur,
and will continue to occur. If the laws against murder, a crime
that is easily detected and severely punished, have never come
close to eliminating it, (39) our anti-discrimination laws will not
eliminate discrimination. Thus, the claim that discriminatory
affirmative action policies must be maintained until we achieve
a "color-blind" society is simply a ruse that will guarantee
eternal life to those policies.
<P>
 Although anti-discrimination laws will never produce a color-blind
society, policymakers can certainly craft a color-blind law. That
is exactly what Congress set out to do when it passed the Civil
Rights Act of 1964, and the legislature was perfectly correct
in expecting that law to reduce the incidence of discrimination.
To the extent that Title VII raises the cost of discriminating
against those protected by the statute, it is simply inevitable
that less discrimination will occur. (40 It emphatically does not
follow, however, that the goal of reducing discrimination against
groups that have historically been the victims of prejudice requires
the use of preferences in their favor.
<P>
 The upside-down notion of using discrimination against some groups
to combat discrimination against other groups begins with the
false premise that any statistical "imbalance" in the
workforce must be the result of discrimination against the underrepresented
group. This premise is not only false; it is preposterous. (41) No
society has ever existed in which human beings sort themselves
into jobs and occupations according to the mathematical laws of
chance:
<P>
<blockquote> The even distribution or proportional representation of groups
in occupations or institutions remains an intellectual construct
defied by reality in society after society. Nor can all this be
attributed to exclusions or discrimination, for often some powerless
or persecuted minorities predominate in prosperous occupations. (42)</blockquote>
<P>
 Attributing every "imbalance" to employer discrimination
assumes away the manifest effects of differences in educational
achievement, family upbringing and cultural traditions, marital
patterns, and even the physical differences between the sexes.
When one begins indulging assumptions like that, one has left
reason behind and entered the realm of mysticism.
<P>
 What discriminatory affirmative action policies certainly can
do is increase the number of minorities and women holding desirable
jobs. That is the basis of their political appeal, just as the
artificial allocation of desirable jobs to whites was a critical
contributor to the political durability of the Jim Crow system.
Reserving certain jobs for certain groups, or giving preferences
to members of those groups, obviously serves the narrow self-interest
of those who enjoy the preferences. These beneficiaries inevitably,
and ironically, are drawn from the most elite and <I>least</I>
disadvantaged segments of the preferred groups. As one shrewd
observer has pointed out, "race-based set-asides have amounted
to no more than a cruel bait-and-switch game in which conditions
of poor Blacks were used to garner preferences that ultimately
benefited upper-income Blacks and White corporations." (43) In
effect, the current preference system creates a labor cartel,
allowing the legally privileged groups to command above-market
wages or (what amounts to the same thing economically) to depress
the demand for their competitors' services. This is wonderful
for the cartel's members, but everyone else pays the price.
<P>
 Apart from the economic inefficiencies imposed on society in
general, the costs of affirmative action are borne largely by
two groups:
<P>
<B> Whites, Men, and Other Unfashionable Groups.</B> The most
obvious victims of legalized discrimination are those individuals,
"predominantly unknown, unaffluent, unorganized," (44) who
are excluded by preferential policies from positions they otherwise
would have obtained. These victims of affirmative action are neither
the CEOs of major corporations nor their highly paid Washington
lobbyists. Nor are they neurotics who deserve to be subjected
to President Clinton's condescending pop psychology. (45) On the contrary,
they are mainly ordinary working people who suffer the same losses
experienced by other victims of discrimination. They are easy
to ignore or make fun of inside the Beltway, but that says more
about the climate in Washington than it does about those who must
live with the decisions that are made there.
<P>
<B> Minority Victims.</B> A less obvious group of victims comprises
those minority individuals and women who would have succeeded
without preferential policies, but whose achievements become clouded
by the suspicion and resentment of others. The fact that resentment
against these individuals is actually unjustified will not prevent
it from occurring. (46)
<P>
<h4>THE OPPOSITION TO REFORM</h4>
<P>
 Perhaps the best evidence that discriminatory preferences are
a serious and widespread phenomenon is the ferocity of the opposition
to abolishing them. (47) For every beneficiary, there is a corresponding
victim. Thus, if the beneficiaries of this discrimination believe
they stand to lose a great deal if it ends, that suggests that
reform of the status quo is an urgent matter. (48) Accordingly, it
is imperative that Congress enact the simple reforms that are
needed to remove the stamp of legal approval from the discrimination
that the law now promotes. But that will not be easy. Besides
the direct beneficiaries of quotas and preferences (including
those who are paid to administer or advocate preferential policies),
politically significant business interests have incentives to
preserve the current legal regime.
<P>
 First, inefficient quota requirements -- whether imposed directly
or indirectly 
<P>
 -- confer advantages on large, established business enterprises
vis-&agrave;-vis their smaller competitors. This effect, which
is a matter of simple economics, is especially powerful when the
regulatory regime involves massive paperwork and reporting requirements
like those imposed by the EEOC and OFCCP.
<P>
 Second, after decades of government pressure to get their numbers
right, a great many large companies have institutionalized affirmative
action as a significant element in their corporate cultures. These
firms thus have large and powerful <I>internal</I> constituencies
for such programs. Those internal constituencies will fight to
protect their interests and will help shape the public posture
of the firm on issues that affect those interests.
<P>
 The incentives that exist for business interests to support the
status quo will not necessarily produce aggressive <I>public</I>
support for policies that favor discrimination. Indeed, business
leaders often adopt an anti-regulatory rhetorical posture even
when they are actively seeking anti-competitive government regulations.
With affirmative action, there are especially strong reasons to
avoid getting caught up directly in the public controversy: For
most big firms, almost any position they adopt on the public policy
question is bound to offend a significant portion of their employees
and customers. (49) But these considerations need not prevent business
interests from taking quiet and indirect steps to protect their
interests. The dubious arguments that support those interests
therefore need to be confronted.
<P>
<h4>THE MYTH OF "VOLUNTARY" AFFIRMATIVE ACTION</h4>
<P>
One of the most enduring myths about affirmative action is that
it reflects voluntary efforts by American employers to comply
with Title VII's spirit of equal opportunity. An especially dangerous
corollary of this myth is that Congress should merely forbid the
federal government from engaging directly in discrimination, leaving
the private sector to continue behaving as it has in the past.
In order to appreciate why both the myth and the corollary are
fallacious, a very rudimentary introduction to the economics of
discrimination will be helpful.
<P>
 There is a respectable, though hardly unimpeachable, economic
argument for repealing the legal constraints on discrimination
by private employers. (50) According to this argument, ordinary market
forces will minimize employer discrimination that is based on
such arbitrary factors as a personal distaste for members of certain
groups. The market, however, would still reward economically efficient
forms of discrimination. This can occur when race or sex is correlated
with desirable characteristics that are costly to identify directly.
Thus, for example, if very few women possess the physical strength
to perform a certain job, it may be cheaper for an employer to
exclude women from consideration than to administer strength tests
to all applicants. Such discrimination, according to the economic
argument, should be tolerated because the efficiencies it creates
benefit <I>all</I> groups over the long run, even if some individuals
are denied jobs for which they are the best qualified. (51)
<P>
 Business interests sometimes use variations on this economic
argument to defend discriminatory affirmative action programs.
They argue, for example, that a diverse workforce is an essential
business imperative because firms need to respond to a racially
and ethnically diverse consumer population. (52) When used to defend
discriminatory policies, these arguments rest on the assumption
that members of certain racial groups are more likely to understand
what consumers in their own group will find appealing, or on the
assumption that customers are more likely to patronize firms that
give a prominent role to employees of their own race. For example:
<P>
<blockquote> Given the national demography and the fact that much of our domestic
business is with city and state governments, walking in with an
all-white male team is a tie-breaker negative, said one chief
executive who was quoted anonymously in the [Glass Ceiling] report.
"If I go to Washington, I need black representatives to interact
with the people who can give me contracts." (53)</blockquote>
<P>
 Assuming that such assumptions are correct, they do not answer
the moral and political question: Should private firms be allowed
to enhance their efficiency by engaging in racial discrimination
or pandering to the racial preferences of their customers? And
even if one believes that private firms should be allowed to do
this for the sake of efficiency, the economic argument cannot
justify forbidding firms to discriminate against some groups but
not others. Efficiency is efficiency, whether it leads firms to
appeal to the preferences of black consumers or white consumers.
Thus, if the economic argument justifies allowing firms to engage
in discriminatory affirmative action, it must also justify allowing
firms to resume old-fashioned patterns of discrimination <I>against</I>
women and minorities.
<P>
 For moral and political reasons, Congress is not likely to give
serious consideration to "deregulating" the market by
repealing Title VII. Some in Congress, however, may be tempted
to believe that leaving private-sector affirmative action programs
alone is an economically benign form of "partial deregulation."
This temptation must be resisted, for the theory on which it rests
is entirely false.
<P>
<h4>INADEQUACY OF LIMITING REFORM TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT</B>
</h4>
Some opponents of racial preferences support a legislative strategy
that focuses primarily on the most notorious forms of direct discrimination
by the federal government, such as contract set-asides. There
certainly are plenty of deserving candidates for extinction among
these programs. Most of them, however, should be doomed in any
event by the Supreme Court's recent decision in <I>Adarand Constructors,
Inc. v. Pe&ntilde;a</I> (54), which held that racial classifications
by the federal government are unconstitutional unless they are
narrowly tailored to serve a compelling government interest. Congress
can and should prevent the Clinton Administration from wasting
society's resources by engaging in protracted litigation in defense
of programs that are legally dubious and morally wrong. But genuine
leadership requires more than staying half a step ahead of the
courts. In any case, this alone would barely touch the most significant
problems that federal law has created. To suppose that the federal
government can get its own house in order merely by ceasing to
practice direct discrimination ignores the pervasive effects that
its laws have on the rest of society.
<P>
 First, even from a strictly economic or libertarian perspective,
reforms that are limited to the federal government would be grossly
inadequate. Such reforms would allow discrimination to continue
in important economic sectors that are not subject to the full
discipline of market forces. This includes state and local governments,
as well as firms that are otherwise insulated from competitive
forces, such as those in the nonprofit sector and in some heavily
regulated industries. No "reform" that leaves these
institutions free to discriminate can be defended on the basis
of free-market principles.
<P>
 Second, the federal government does not merely permit private
firms to engage in discriminatory affirmative action. On the contrary,
it actively <I>pressures</I> them to discriminate through compliance
reviews of federal contractors by the Labor Department and through
the litigation policies of the EEOC. Just as the supposedly "voluntary"
racial quotas at issue in <I>Weber</I> actually were adopted in
the face of Labor Department pressure, much of the current culture
of affirmative action has developed in an effort to satisfy the
demand of federal bureaucrats for the "right numbers."
<P>
 Third, and perhaps most important, the current legal doctrines
on affirmative action <I>inherently</I> promote discrimination
by private firms because of the asymmetrical treatment of different
groups. Even if federal agencies were to get completely out of
the business of promoting discrimination, the law itself would
continue to promote discrimination through the incentives it creates
for private employers. Consider the choice confronting an employer
who has two candidates, one minority and one white, for a promotion
to a managerial position. If both candidates possess the minimal
qualifications for the position, the employer faces a substantial
risk of litigation if the white is promoted, even if the white
candidate has better qualifications. If the employer denies the
promotion to the better-qualified white candidate under an affirmative
action plan, however, the risk of liability is near zero. Faced
with these asymmetrical incentives, rational employers inevitably
and systematically will discriminate against legally disfavored
groups, especially whites and men. Allowing this to continue is
not a benign form of "partial deregulation," but a powerful
engine of government-sponsored favoritism. Until these incentives
are removed, market forces will continue to <I>foster</I> discrimination
rather than discourage it.
<P>
<h4>THE EXAGGERATED THREAT OF DISPARATE IMPACT LITIGATION</h4>
<P>
Because the economic, or "free market," rationale for
allowing minority preferences is untenable, business lobbyists
may claim that they must engage in this form of discrimination
in order to protect themselves from litigation based on statistical
underrepresentation. This argument has some merit in theory, but
its practical significance can easily be overstated. To the extent
that the argument is valid, moreover, it suggests the need for
reform of the rules governing statistics-based litigation, <I>not</I>
for the preservation of rules permitting employers to engage in
discriminatory affirmative action. To understand why the threat
of litigation over "bad numbers" is less than pressing,
though still worth solving, a brief discussion of the law's evolution
is required.
<P>
 In a 1971 decision, <I>Griggs v. Duke Power Co.</I> (55), the Supreme
Court accepted the Nixon Administration's contention that employment
criteria that lead to "underrepresentation" of minorities
in a company's workforce can be unlawful even if the employer
has not intentionally discriminated against anyone. This theory,
which goes by the name of "disparate impact analysis,"
had no basis in the law and in fact was incompatible with the
statute. Chief Justice Burger's opinion flouted the text of Title
VII, distorted and misrepresented the legislative history, and
even went so far as to misstate the factual findings of the district
court in the <I>Griggs</I> case itself. (56) Apart from being a legislative
rather than a judicial exercise, the legislative draftsmanship
in the <I>Griggs</I> opinion was utterly incompetent. Burger declared
that statistical disparities could lead to liability, but he offered
no intelligible test either for deciding what statistical comparisons
should be used or for deciding how large the disparities must
be.
<P>
 Burger's opinion also created a legal defense that employers
could use to justify disparities that otherwise would produce
liability, but he offered no fewer than eight different and conflicting
formulations of the standard that such employment criteria must
meet. The hopeless ambiguities and vagueness of <I>Griggs</I>,
and the impossibility of seeking guidance from the statute that
<I>Griggs</I> had recklessly amended, set the Court on a long
and difficult search for a manageable set of legal standards.
During the early years of this process, many lower courts made
it relatively easy for plaintiffs to establish a statistical case
against an employer, and employers often were held to absurdly
high standards of "business necessity" in defending
employment criteria that failed to generate "enough"
minorities and women in certain jobs.
<P>
 Employers that used race-neutral hiring criteria (as Kaiser Aluminum
had been doing before the Labor Department pressured it to adopt
the racial quota that was challenged in <I>Weber</I>) thereby
exposed themselves to liability if such criteria had a disparate
impact on minorities. Unless employers were allowed to get their
numbers "right" by discriminating against whites, they
would be placed in a Catch-22: vulnerable to Labor Department
sanctions and/or lawsuits by minorities if race-neutral criteria
led to disparate effects and liable to whites if they sought to
avoid such suits by instituting preferential policies. By permitting
employers to engage in preferential treatment of minorities, the
Court offered them a comparatively cheap way of escaping this
Catch-22.
<P>
 Employers will oppose any legal regime that forces them to make
decisions that expose them to liability no matter what they do.
They can hardly be blamed for this, and the law certainly should
not create Catch-22s for anyone. In 1989,however, the Supreme
Court articulated standards of proof for disparate impact cases
that were much more favorable to employers than the rules that
had taken root in the lower courts. (57) Under these standards, plaintiffs
were required to show that the employer's conduct actually caused
substantial underrepresentation. The Court also concluded that
defendants could escape liability simply by producing evidence
that their employment criteria were based on legitimate business
reasons. This ruling greatly reduced the threat of disparate impact
liability for all but the most inexplicably arbitrary employment
practices, and thus greatly reduced the pressure on employers
to adopt preferential policies designed to produce statistically
balanced workforces.
<P>
 In the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Congress codified the theory
of disparate impact, thus ratifying a previously illegitimate
doctrine. In doing so, however, the legislation preserved almost
all of the safeguards for employers that the Supreme Court had
established in its 1989 decision. More important, perhaps, the
1991 statute created a new remedial scheme authorizing compensatory
and punitive damages in cases involving intentional discrimination,
but <I>not</I> in cases arising under the disparate impact theory. (58) 
This new rule creates tremendously powerful incentives for plaintiffs
and their attorneys to forego disparate impact litigation in favor
of claims based on the standard theory of intentional discrimination. (59)
<P>
 These incentives, together with the relatively circumscribed
disparate impact standards codified in the 1991 statute, have
caused the virtual disappearance of serious disparate impact litigation. (60) 
For that reason, business interests no longer can legitimately
maintain that the restoration of a color-blind legal rule will
create the Catch-22 described above.
<P>
 Business lobbyists nonetheless might argue that courts and enforcement
agencies may revive disparate impact litigation at some future
time. This possibility cannot be ruled out completely. The most
likely way for this to happen would involve an aggressive disparate
impact campaign by the EEOC and the Justice Department, combined
with judicial misinterpretation of ambiguous language in the 1991
statute. Because EEOC and Justice are public agencies, they are
less subject than the private plaintiffs' bar to the financial
disincentives that the 1991 Act created for disparate impact litigation.
And the courts, as we have seen so often in the past, are perfectly
capable of seizing on any real or imagined ambiguity in the civil
rights statutes when they want to expand the reach of those statutes
beyond what Congress has authorized.
<P>
 This possibility -- that federal agencies and the courts again
will cause disparate impact litigation to become a serious problem
-- does not seem likely to materialize in the foreseeable future.
The EEOC's workload has gone up dramatically in recent years,
largely because of an increase in intentional discrimination claims
under Title VII (especially claims involving sexual harassment)
and under the Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990. The agency's
budget, however, has not seen commensurate increases, and the
agency would therefore have difficulty in diverting significant
resources to disparate impact litigation. Similarly, while the
courts certainly have the power to interpret the 1991 statute
in a way that would greatly facilitate abuses of the disparate
impact theory, recent judicial trends do not suggest that this
is likely to happen.
<P>
<h4>RESTORE THE COLOR-BLIND LAW THAT CONGRESS ENACTED</B>
</h4>
Congress is not to blame for the misinterpretations to which Title
VII has been subjected. Writing in 1979, then-Justice Rehnquist
noted: 
<P>
 <blockquote>Were Congress to act today specifically to prohibit the type
of racial discrimination suffered by [the plaintiff in <I>Weber</I>],
it would be hard pressed to draft language better tailored to
the task than that found in [sections 703(a) and (d)] of Title VII.  (61)</blockquote>

<P>
 Rehnquist's comment remains equally valid today, and there is
little reason to tamper with the operative language of the statute.
Rather, what is needed is an amendment requiring the courts and
executive agencies to begin obeying the law that Congress framed
three decades ago.
<P>
 In fact, Congress foresaw in 1964 that its clear language might
be misconstrued and included in the statute a provision specifically
foreclosing any interpretation requiring the correction of statistical
imbalances in an employer's workforce. (62) Had the <I>Weber</I> majority
not been driven by an Orwellian contempt for the meaning of words, (63) 
this precautionary provision would have accomplished its purpose. (64)

<P>
 A more comprehensive and carefully drafted statement of congressional
insistence that Title VII means what it says, however, can now
accomplish what Congress sought to achieve in 1964. While there
can be no absolute assurance against the flouting of legislative
commands, the courts have become less reckless in recent years.
They are unlikely to defy Congress on this issue, and enactment
of legislation embodying the principles summarized below should
assure that the principle of equal opportunity finally is accepted
into the law.
<P>
<B>Legislative Solutions</B>
<P>
 The key provisions of such a legislative approach are as follows:
<P>
Ban quotas and preferences. Congress should forbid courts and
enforcement agencies from interpreting Title VII to authorize,
permit, or encourage the use of quotas or preferences relating
to race or sex. 
<P>
<B>Permit legitimate affirmative action.</B> Congress should state
that employers may adopt <I>legitimate</I> affirmative action
policies that promote equal opportunity without using or encouraging
the use of quotas or preferences. This proviso would allow employers
to ensure that minorities and women are not excluded from employment
opportunities by managers' prejudices, stereotypes, or inappropriate
recruiting habits. (65)
<P>
<B>End backdoor quotas.</B> Employers should be prohibited from
engaging in indirect forms of discrimination through euphemisms
like "diversity," "inclusiveness," or developing
a "multicultural workforce." The existing cast of bureaucrats
and corporate affirmative action officers also should be forbidden
from repackaging the same old surreptitious racial quotas under
some new rubric like "socially disadvantaged background." (66)
<P>
 The promoters of preferences repeatedly have shifted their language
and invented new excuses for continuing the discriminatory policies
of the past. In order to deprive them of the legalistic arguments
at which they have proven so adept, any legislation adopted by
Congress must contain airtight legislative language that closes
the door to the use of new euphemisms and new rationales for discrimination.

<P>
 This, in brief, is the appropriate way to restore the ideal of
equal treatment under the law to which Title VII originally was
dedicated. There is neither any need nor any justification for
compromises, incremental changes, or further temporizing.<p>

<li>Section 703(i) specifically authorizes one very limited form
of discriminatory preference for a "protected group":
 "Nothing contained in [Title VII] shall apply to any business
or enterprise on or near an Indian reservation with respect to
any publicly announced employment practice of such business or
enterprise under which a preferential treatment is given to any
individual because he is an Indian living on or near a reservation."
 42 U.S.C.  2000e2.  By specifically including this exception
to the basic rule of Title VII, the statute clearly implies that
similar preferences for other groups are <I>not</I> authorized.

<li>703(e), 42 U.S.C.  2000e2(e).  This exception from the basic
prohibition against discrimination applies with respect to religion
and national origin, as well as sex.  Reflecting Congress's special
concern with racial discrimination, the statute makes no provision
for treating race or color as a bona fide occupational qualification.

<li>An important exception exists for the uniformed military services.
 See, <I>e.g.</I>, <I>Roper v.  Department of the Army</I>, 832
F.2d 247 (2d Cir.  1987).

<li>Section 107(a) of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 added a provision
to Title VII that, by its terms, would seem specifically to prohibit
typical forms of discriminatory affirmative action:  "Except
as otherwise provided in this title, an unlawful employment practice
is established when the complaining party demonstrates that race,
color, religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating factor
for any employment practice, even though other factors also motivated
the practice."  Civil Rights Act of 1991,  107(a), 42 U.S.C.
 2000e2(m).  Section 116 of the 1991 statute, however, also provided
that "[n]othing in the amendments made by this title shall
be construed to affect courtordered remedies, affirmative action,
or conciliation agreements, that are in accordance with the law."
 Civil Rights Act of 1991, 116, 42 U.S.C.  1981 note.  If affirmative
action policies that were permitted under pre1991 judicial precedents
are assumed to be "in accordance with the law" within
the meaning of Section 116, then Section 107(a) can be interpreted
to allow their continuation.  Because the legislative history
of the 1991 Act does not evince an intent to overrule those judicial
precedents, the Supreme Court is unlikely to hold that Section
107(a) outlawed previously permissible affirmative action policies.
 <I>Cf.  Officers for Justice v.  Civil Service Commission</I>,
979 F.2d 721 (9th Cir.  1992), cert.  denied, 113 S.  Ct.  1645
(1993).  By the same token, however, the legislative history of
the 1991 statute does not manifest congressional intent to codify
the judicial decisions that permit discriminatory affirmative
action.  For further detail, see Nelson Lund, "Lawyers and
the Defense of the Presidency," <I>Brigham Young University
Law Review</I>, 1995, pp.  17, 90 n.196.

<li>Federal regulations, for example, require that every "utilization
analysis" consider the minority population of the surrounding
labor area, the size of the minority unemployment force, and the
percentage of the minority workforce compared with the total workforce.
 In addition to such factors, which ignore qualifications entirely,
the regulations also require the consideration of factors that
do not take account of the relative qualifications among individuals,
such as the availability of "promotable and transferable
minorities" within the contractor's organization.  See 41
C.F.R.  602.11(b)(1).  Contractors must take "special corrective
action" when there is an "underutilization" of
minorities, or when other phenomena occur, as when a lower percentage
of minority than nonminority applicants meets the firm's employment
criteria, or minorities meet the firm's promotion criteria at
a lower rate than nonminorities.  <I>Id.</I>  602.23.  These phenomena,
obviously, are not necessarily caused by discrimination, and "special
corrective action" often will entail discrimination against
better qualified individuals.

<li>This applies, obviously, only to the sector of the economy in
which an antidiscrimination law is enforced.  Because Title VII
contains an exemption for firms with fewer than 15 employees,
its actual effect could consist largely in shifting minorities
and women from smaller firms to larger firms.  Such an effect
is magnified when pressure is exerted on larger firms to discriminate
in favor of minorities and women.  There is some empirical evidence
suggesting that exactly this has occurred.  See, <I>e.g.</I>,
Ferrell Bloch, "Affirmative Action Hasn't Helped Blacks,"
<I>The Wall Street Journal</I>, March 1, 1995, p.  A14:  "While
black unemployment rates have remained twice those of whites,
the proportion of blacks working for firms with 100 or more employees
(who must file annual EEO1 reports to the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission), federal contractors (who are subject to Labor Department
affirmative action requirements), and local, state and federal
government has grown dramatically.  For example, in 1966, black
female managers were 40% less likely than white male managers
to work in firms with 100 or more employees.  But by 1980, black
female managers were 50% more likely than their white male counterparts
to work in these larger companies."

<li>See Thomas Sowell, <I>Civil Rights:  Rhetoric or Reality</I> (New

that all groups are prepared to make the same sacrifices to achieve
the same ends, quite aside from any question of equal capability,
natural or acquired.  Yet without that assumption, there is no
reason to expect the even representation which is used as a norm
to measure discrimination."

that "the income gap between different tiers of black income
groups has been steadily growing since the enactment of the first
civil rights legislation.  Between 1970 and 1986, the percentage
of black families with incomes over $50,000 nearly doubled, while

action supporters must understand that this is 'psychologically,
a difficult time for a lot of white males  the socalled angry
white male.'"

<li>A recent <I>USA Today</I>/CNN/Gallup Poll found that 19 percent
of black women and 28 percent of black men believe that their
colleagues "privately questioned your abilities or qualifications
because of affirmative action."  The same survey found that
32 percent of whites thought that "a racial minority where
you worked got an undeserved job or promotion as a result of affirmative
action programs."  "Affirmative Action:  The Public
Reaction," <I>USA Today</I>, March 24, 1995, p.  3A.

<li>The mere possibility of a voter initiative to curtail affirmative
action in California has generated threats of an economic boycott
against that state.  And those threats apparently are meant to
have a wider effect:  "This [boycott threat] is also directed
at two Washington players:  Congress and the White House,"
said one civil rights leader, who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
 "Both have to be reminded that there is going to be a major
effort to bring political costs into this debate and balance the
scales of consideration.  Right now the debate is tilted in favor
of accommodating the political views of white males."  Steven
A.  Holmes, "Government Acts to Set its Policy on Race Programs,"
<I>The New York Times</I>, June 24, 1995, p.  1.  The Clinton
Administration obviously will not challenge the civil rights establishment.
 Unfortunately, the urge to temporize in the face of intimidating
tactics undoubtedly remains strong even among conservatives. 
One prominent Republican, for example, recently made the amazing
pronouncement that "we as a party need to work hard to earn
the right to deal with this issue and to deal with it in a sensitive
way."  See Nancy E.  Roman, "GOP Panel To Go Slow on
Affirmative Action:  Leaders Don't Want to Alienate Blacks,"
<I>The Washington Times</I>, June 7, 1995, p.  A12.  Because it
is obvious that no one has to "earn" the right to do
the right thing, statements like this inevitably give off an aroma
of cynical political calculation.

<li>On the other hand, if the beneficiaries (and thus the victims)
of preferential policies are actually the rare exception in the
American workplace, what harm could there be in restoring the
law of equal treatment?

<li><I>Cf., e.g.</I>, Judith H.  Dobrzynski, "Some Action, Little
Talk," <I>The New York Times</I>, April 20, 1995, p.  D1:
 "[W]hile many of the more than two dozen company and industry
association executives contacted spoke privately about affirmative
action, almost none would comment for the record."

<li>This argument is developed at length in Richard A.  Epstein, <I>Forbidden
Grounds:  The Case Against Employment Discrimination Laws</I>
(Cambridge, Mass.:  Harvard University Press, 1992).

<li>In addition, there are substantial costs involved in administering
and enforcing the antidiscrimination laws.  If those costs were
eliminated, some of the savings would be used to increase wages
and/or create more jobs.

<li>See, <I>e.g.</I>, Jonathan Kaufman, "Management:  How Workplaces
May Look Without Affirmative Action," <I>The Wall Street
Journal</I>, March 20, 1995, p.  B1:  "Eastman Kodak Co.
 maintains it is committed to diversity because the composition
of the American work force is changing and so is its customer
base. ' If affirmative action wasn't legislated, we'd still continue
with our goal of building a diverse work force,' says Patricia
Fleming, Kodak's director of affirmative action.  Kodak won't
specify how many women or blacks it has in top positions, but
it recently tied a portion of management compensation to recruitment
and promotion of minorities and women."

New York Times</I>, March 17, 1995, p.  A14.

Review</I> (forthcoming).

<li><I>Wards Cove Packing Co.  v.  Atonio</I>, 490 U.S.  642 (1989).

<li>In a disparate impact case, remedies are confined largely to injunctive
relief, limited back pay, and attorney's fees.  These limitations
applied to all Title VII cases prior to 1991.  The new statute
caps compensatory and punitive damages for intentional discrimination
at different levels according to the size of the defendant.  For
the large firms that offer the most attractive targets for disparate
impact and class action lawsuits, the cap is set at $300,000 per
claim.

<li>For further detail, see Glen D.  Nager and Julia M.  Broas, "Enforcement
Issues:  A Practical Overview," <I>Louisiana Law Review</I>,
Vol.  54 (1994), pp.  1473, 14821483.

<li>I have been able to find only one reported case in which a private
firm was held liable under the disparate impact provisions of
the 1991 Act.  In <I>Bradley v.  Pizzaco of Nebraska, Inc.</I>,
7 F.3d 795 (8th Cir.  1993), the court forbade a pizza chain's
relatively trivial practice of requiring employees to be cleanshaven.
 This case almost certainly will not become an important precedent,
for the court's reasoning was extremely poor.  The Eight Circuit's
opinion, for example, did not even discuss the operative provision
of the statute, and it actually misquoted the provision on which
it purported to rely.  In <I>EEOC v.  Joint Apprenticeship Committee</I>,
828 F.  Supp.  264 (S.D.  N.Y.  1993), the court used a disparate
impact theory to invalidate a high school education  requirement
for admission into an apprenticeship program.  This case was tried
well before the 1991 Act came into effect, and its significance
is reduced by the fact that the defendant chose for tactical reasons
at trial only to challenge the government's <I>prima facie</I>
case without offering a "business justification" defense.

<li><I>Weber</I>, 443 U.S.  at 226 (dissenting opinion).  See also
<I>Johnson</I>, 480 U.S.  at 657 (Scalia, J., dissenting).

<li>Section 703(j) provides:  "Nothing contained in [Title
VII] shall be interpreted to require any employer...  subject
to this [title] to grant preferential treatment to any individual
or to any group because of the race, color, religion, sex, or
national origin of such individual or group on account of an imbalance
which may exist with respect to the total number or percentage
of persons of any race, color, religion, sex, or national origin
employed by any employer...  in comparison with the total number
or percentage of persons of such race, color, religion, sex, or
national origin in any community, State, section, or other area,
or in the available work force in any community, State, section,
or other area."  42 U.S.C.  2000e2(j).

<li>For a discussion comparing the <I>Weber</I> majority's behavior
to that of the nightmare government in Orwell's <I>1984</I>, see
Justice Rehnquist's <I>Weber</I> dissent.  443 U.S.  at 219221.

<li>The <I>Weber</I> majority inferred from 703(j)'s ban on interpretations
<I>requiring</I> employers to grant preferential treatment that
Congress meant to allow interpretations <I>permitting</I> employers
to grant preferential treatment.  This negative inference is absurd.
 There are an infinite number of possible misinterpretations of
any statutory language, and 703(j) could not possibly list them
all.  The fact that it rules out one misinterpretation, therefore,
does not imply that it means to allow any others.  By contrast,
a valid negative inference can arise when a statute creates express
exceptions to an otherwise general rule.  Absent contrary evidence,
the creation of such express exceptions implies that similar exceptions
are not intended because it shows that the legislature considered
and rejected the need for exceptions other than the ones it expressly
included.  Title VII includes an express exception for preferential
policies, which is carefully limited to certain circumstances
involving Indians living on or near reservations.  See 703(i),
42 U.S.C.  2000e2(i).  This exception clearly implies that other
forms of preferential affirmative action are forbidden.

<li>The legislation should leave untouched the existing law regarding
employers' use of classifications based on sex, religion, or national
origin where such characteristics are a "bona fide occupational
qualification reasonably necessary to the normal operation of
that particular business or enterprise."  703(e), 42 U.S.C.
 2000e2(e).  This exception to Title VII's prohibition against
discrimination has been construed more narrowly than Congress
had reason to anticipate in 1964, but the issues raised by these
narrowing constructions are separate from the issues raised by
affirmative action.

<li>For concise critiques (from different points on the political
spectrum) of the notion of giving preferences to the "socially
disadvantaged," see James P.  Scanlan, "No Substitute
for The Real Thing," <I>Legal Times</I>, May 1, 1995, p.

   The issue is often raised, particularly in presidential election years, whether or not America needs a third party.  More specifically, for the past few presidential election cycles, voters have not been completely satisfied with the nominees from both major parties and they pine for a third option.  This year is no different.
<p>
   A recent poll conducted by the Gordon S. Black Corporation revealed that 46 percent of voters are angry at both parties and 47 percent said a new party is needed.  However, the percentage of those who are angry with both parties is down 10 points from four years ago.
   Voters have a virtual panoply of third-party options.  Besides the somewhat familiar Libertarian Party, Green Party and Ross Perot's Reform Party, there are the lesser known Natural Law Party, Patriot Party, Democratic Socialists of America, Communist Party, Independence Party, Socialist Party and D.C. Statehood Party, to name a few.
<p>
   Nevertheless, the existence of so many parties with relatively small constituencies and narrow agendas poses an obstacle for the creation of a competitive third party.  The 22 percent core supporters of a new party are too diverse in their beliefs and issue positions to coalesce within a single party effectively.
<p>
   No better evidence of this exists than the hodgepodge of attendees at the United We Stand America convention in Dallas last year, which I attended.  This was the much-publicized conference to which Perot invited all of the contending GOP candidates, including Sen. Bob Dole and Patrick J. Buchanan, as well as a representative of the Clinton administration.  The lack of a resounding theme, other than anger with Democrats and Republicans, was instructive.
<p>   
Those attending ranged from opponents of NAFTA and GATT, to strict constitutionalists, to gun owner enthusiasts, to conspiracy theorists, to balanced budget advocates, to critics of the Council on Foreign Relations, to pro-lifers and pro-choicers, to even a fair sprinkling of what could accurately be described as kooks.  No common thread recurred during my conversations with conference attendees, except disillusionment with the two major parties.
<p>
   Perot's Reform Party appears to have the most momentum for now.  As this edition went to press, it had met ballot access requirements in New Mexico, bringing to 12 the number of states where the party has qualified to appear on the 1996 ballot.  The other states are California, Maine, Montana, North Dakota, Ohio, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia and Minnesota.
<p>   
Petition drives are under way in 25 other states and organizers are confident the party will be on the ballot in all 50 states.  The party is in court in Arkansas, in a suit to get on that state's ballot.  Ballot access is being achieved either by placing the actual party on the ballot or through a stand-in candidate who, in most cases, will presumably be Ross Perot.
<p>
   Perhaps the threat of a viable third party will persuade the Democrats and/or Republicans to more directly address voters' concerns with substantive proposals, rather than campaign using attack ads, sound bites, wedge issues and symbolic gestures.  The quality of the campaigns waged during the coming months, or the lack thereof, should be a good indicator.

<TITLE><HEAD>National Minority Politics - From the Publisher - May 1996</title>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<h2>From the Publisher</h2><p><h3>MAY 1996</h3><p><img src="red-line.gif"><p>	
<P>

The cover of this May 1996 edition features portraits 
of six individuals who represent the spectrum of 
present-day conservatism.  (Two of the gentlemen, Sen. 
Robert Dole (R-Kans.) and retired general Colin Powell, 
are often described as political moderates, but they 
both have support from a significant portion of the 
self-identified conservative populace.)<P>
Among those portrayed, syndicated columnist and two-
time presidential candidate Patrick Buchanan and former 
ambassador Alan Keyes are furthest to the right of the 
political spectrum.  Buchanan, who has emphasized the 
controversial issues of abortion, immigration, 
affirmative action and the exportation of American jobs, 
calls his a "conservatism of the heart."<P>  
Keyes waged his presidential campaign this year on 
the primary issue of returning America to its moral 
foundation, beginning with the restoration of the two-
parent, marriage-based family.  For Keyes, the most 
crucial aspect of this moral revival starts with 
outlawing legalized abortions, which he says is the 
single most important issue in relationship to 
everything else.<P>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich, with his championing of 
the GOP "Contract With America," has advanced an agenda 
which combines fiscal and social conservatism.  
Unfortunately, after several months of relentless 
pummeling by the media, as well as a few public missteps 
of his own, Gingrich has the highest negative ratings of 
any political figure today.  The existence of these high 
negatives, in effect, precludes his ability to carry the 
conservative banner to the American electorate.<P>
Former Congressman and HUD Secretary Jack Kemp 
focuses most of his attention on the fiscal and economic 
issues of restructuring the tax system by creating a 
flat tax, cutting taxes and expanding the economy.  He 
has also concentrated much of his energy on swelling the 
ranks of the Republican Party by including more minority 
and low-income voters.  However, he has had limited 
results, though not from a lack of effort.  In fact, 
Kemp has been criticized in some quarters for even 
making an attempt to bring non-traditional voters into 
the GOP's "big tent".<P>
Dole and Powell, who are perhaps the least 
conservative of the bunch, nonetheless enjoy broad 
support among many conservatives who believe that in 
order to maintain a Republican legislative majority in 
both houses of Congress and expand majority status to 
the state and local levels, effective outreach to 
moderates and independents is essential.  Both have been 
chided by some of their fellow Republicans for not being 
conservative enough on social issues.<P>
As is the case with most political movements, 
conservatism is largely defined by its messengers.  When 
a greater proportion of these messengers are described 
as "extreme," then, by extension, conservatism itself is 
believed to be extreme as well.<P>
Much of this definition process takes place through 
the mass media.  For example, conservatives are often 
referred to disparagingly by journalists as members of 
the "far right," the "religious right" or the "extreme 
right."  Yet liberals are almost never referred to by 
the press as the "far left."  These negative 
descriptions of conservatives are planted in the minds 
of the American public to the point where they as 
presumed to be true, whether they are factual or not.<P>
Conservatives would do well to get a handle on how 
they are defined, if they hope to expand their ranks 
beyond their base of committed activists.

<TITLE><HEAD>National Minority Politics - From the Publisher - April 1996</title></HEAD>
<BODY>
<h2>From the Publisher</h2><p><h3>APRIL 1996</h3><p><img src="red-line.gif"><p>	
<P>
     Our April cover visually describes the Democrats' current operating philosophy.  For the past few election cycles, voters have been pulling Democrats in the direction of limited and more efficient government which is less intrusive and less costly.  Yet, Democrats resist, opting instead for the status quo.  Present the Democrats with a problem and they will, always, present a federal government program as the solution.<p>
     A recent case in point is President Clinton's handling of the issue of domestic abuse, with his unveiling of a national 1-800 "hotline" for abuse victims.<p>
     On its face, a national domestic abuse hotline sounds like a good idea.  The thought that some poor woman is being physically abused on a regular basis by her spouse or boyfriend is frightening to women from all sectors of society.  Donna Shalala, Secretary of Health and Human Services, applauded the President's effort.  "[B]ecause of this president's leadership every woman in this country will have a toll-free and anonymous lifeline to safety, whenever or wherever she needs it," she said.<p>
     Sounds good so far.  But that, among other things, is exactly what is wrong with most federal social programs.  They appeal to our emotions, rather than our logic.<p>
     In this case, logic would dictate that a centralized government program administered from Washington to assist domestic abuse victims is inefficient at best, when local programs can operate more quickly and effectively, and at a lower cost.  After all, what good would it do for a woman who is being abused to call a bureaucrat hundreds or thousands of miles away in Washington?<p>
     In addition, this program exacerbates the time-honored tradition of politicians nudging citizens to look to Washington for solutions, rather than find them in their own communities.  Rather than promoting community-based problem solving, this hotline promotes Washington-based problem solving, adding to our already massive national deficit.<p>
     In fact, this hotline program could actually be dangerous.  A woman who is experiencing an abusive situation could waste precious time calling our nation's capitol, when she should be calling 911 in her local area where help is only minutes away.<p>
     And at a cost of $1 million, this hotline hardly comes cheap.  But, from all accounts, media were so busy "cheerleading" the president for his sensitivity, that they forgot to ask about whether or not the program would actually benefits those for whom it was designed.  Members of Congress were silent as well.  And who ends up holding the bag for media's and politicians' failure to do their jobs?  All of us do, as American taxpayers.<p>
     Programs like this hotline can be a ready-made source of data on social problems.  This information can then be used to justify increased funding or to dramatize an issue.  In five or 10 years, when the program's budget has multipled 10-fold and Congress examines whether the growth in spending should be cut to help the government live within its means, constituents can then point to the numbers of calls received via the hotline and declare, "If you cut this program, 10,000 women will die every year as a result of domestic violence."<p>
     Of course, they have no hard evidence to support their declaration, other than the fact that they have, by virtue of starting the hotline, funneled calls into a central location.  But these battle cries are enough to make all but the most vigilent of Congressmembers back down.<p>
     It is up to each of us, as taxpayers, to keep a watchful eye on politicians' attempts to buy our votes in the future.  Unless we refuse to keep falling for the scam repeated by our elected officials every election year, our federal deficit and national debt will only continue to spiral out of control. <p>

<h2>From the Publisher</h2><p>
<h3>January 1996</h3>
<p><img src="red-line.gif"><p>      
<P>

<P>
When Republicans won control of
both houses of Congress in 1994, a significant portion of the
electorate had high hopes that, for the first time in several
decades, some fiscal restraint would be instituted by our elected
officials on Capitol Hill. Two years earlier, Ross Perot had put
the concept of a balanced budget on the table. The idea of leaving
our children and grandchildren saddled with debt that we created
was unthinkable. Now, voters thought in November 1994, we have
a new crop of leaders who will straighten things out.
<P>
At this point in the budget debate,
however, I believe it is fair to say that the Republicans have
lost the high ground. Rather than being perceived as the champions
of responsible government, many voters view the GOP and its legions
as pawns of the rich--willing to cut government programs for the
poor while leaving the programs that benefit the well-to-do largely
intact.
<P>
The Democrats have so successfully
demagogued the issue of balancing the federal budget that, any
time the Republicans propose reducing the rate of growth in programs,
a collective chorus of Democrats labels them &quot;extremists&quot;
who want to starve children and throw the elderly out into the
streets. The Democrats have simply been better at casting the
argument in human terms, making the Republicans look like cold-hearted
numbers crunchers.
<P>
Witness President Clinton's handling
of the budget negotiations. When he vetoed one of the Republican
budget proposals, the President was surrounded by young children,
as he vowed that he would not let the GOP harm those youngsters.
Granted, the children all appeared to be well-dressed and well-fed,
exactly the kind of children least likely to need government assistance.
But a picture is worth a thousand words.
<P>
Utilizing constituents as props
is one of the Democrats' best tactics. And Republicans have either
been caught off guard or simply have not mastered the fine art
of relating to the average taxpayer.
<P>
A case in point is a CNN town
hall meeting in December in which House Majority Whip Tom DeLay
participated. In my personal dealings with DeLay, I have always
found him to be a responsive, compassionate officeholder. But
he could have shown more sensitivity in his handling of the questions
asked at the meeting.
<P>
A gentleman in the audience asked
the Texas congressman, &quot;Since government employees are missing
portions of their paychecks during the Christmas season, why doesn't
the Congress forego getting paid until it resolves the budget
mess?&quot;
<P>
DeLay's response: &quot;I'm not
a government employee; I'm a 'constitutional officer.'&quot;
<P>
The audience was stunned. While
DeLay relied on the specifics of the Constitution to defend his
receiving his salary during the government shutdown, he failed
to make another constitutional observation. The Founding Fathers
never intended for our elected representatives' salaries to be
so much greater than the typical American family. 
<P>
Senators and representatives earn
$133,600 per year, nearly four times the $35,800 the average American
family earns. Their high incomes make them so far removed from
the daily lives of their constituents that they cannot relate
to their problems. Democrats compensate for this income disparity
by tauting their credentials as champions of the poor, but Republicans
don't have a shield to defend them against critics' charges that
they are arrogant and greedy.
<P>
Perhaps Republican activist William
Bennett best summed up the party's dilemma: &quot;What's come
across quite clearly is that we Republicans are smart and serious
and that we are going to shrink the government. What hasn't come
across is a lot of compassion.&quot;

On its face, the concept of children's rights appears to be worthwhile.
After all, none of us want to see children abused by adults--be
they parents, guardians or others were are biologically unrelated,
but who wield dominance and power based on their size and experience.
<P>
However, some child-welfare advocates, usually liberal in their
political persuasion, have taken things too far. The policies
of well-meaning liberals have already resulted in the virtual
destruction of poor families and the weakening of middle-class
families by making the role of the male-husband and father-dispensable.
They are now on the road to dealing the final blow by separating
children from the one remaining parent--the mother.
<P>
Just listen to the rhetoric of so called children's advocates
like Marian Wright Edelman of the Children's Defense Fund. In
her speeches, Edelman, a close friend of first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton, cites numerous statistics on the numbers and conditions
of poor children.
<P>
But Edelman and others like her, while perhaps well intentioned,
fail to recognize that children have no income-earning ability.
They are the responsibility of their parents, not wards of the
state. There is no substitute for loving, responsible parents,
who discipline their children-no matter what their incomes.
<P>
Government interference with child-rearing has already weakened
parental authority. Parents report instances of their children
calling (or threatening to call) Children's Protective Services--not
because of child abuse, but because of disciplinary measures they
don't like.
<P>
Children also threaten to file lawsuits when they are unhappy
with curfews and limitations on activities. Mothers raising teen-age
children alone often have difficulty maintaining control when
the government is always in the background, thwarting their control
in their own homes.
<P>
And, as we've seen in several cases over the past few years, children
are now given power within our court system to divorce their parents.
Our government has given our children, who are in our care as
ordained by God, the wherewithal to usurp our authority.
<P>
Added to this, most state governments have completely removed
teachers' authority to utilize discipline in the classroom. Unlike
classrooms of 20 to 30 years ago, students are now aware that
teachers' and principals' hands are tied by the state when it
comes to applying punishment for deeds done in school. With this
knowledge, students threaten and, in many cases, inflict bodily
harm upon teachers. This is indeed a sad state of affairs.
<P>
The primary problem we face with youth today is that many parents
no longer take an active role in child-rearing and depend on others--schools,
churches and the government-to do it for them.
<P>
Liberals have found no solution to child poverty with their theories;
but they will create a whole different set of problems if they
continue to focus on government programs rather than strengthening
the family and home environment.

<h3>OCTOBER 1995</h3>
<p>
<img src="red-line.gif">
<p>
	Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas may be one of the most maligned political figures today.  Besides being castigated for his court opinions, Thomas has had to endure attacks on his racial loyalty.
	<P>At the NAACP annual convention in Minneapolis this summer, Thomas' name was raised at virtually every session.  He was called a traitor to his community, a "pimp," and "Clarence 'I don't want to be black' Thomas."  In her opening speech, the group's chair, Myrlie Evers-Williams, read a long sarcastic poem in his honor:<P>
<blockquote>"How did his mind get so twisted<br>
And who does he think he is. . .<br>
And how can he imagine he is able<br>
To be anything but black?"<P></blockquote><P>

	In the June 26 edition of <I>Time</i> magazine, columnist Jack E. White, who is black, described Thomas as "the scariest of all the hobgoblins" in Washington, D.C.  "The most disturbing thing about Thomas is not his conclusions, but his twisted reasoning and bilious rage," continued White, as if he knows Thomas personally.<P>
	On Sept. 12, the infamous New York preacher, Rev. Al Sharpton, led a band of 600 people in a protest near the associate justice's Northern Virginia home.<P>
	Thomas was not home during Sharpton's 90-minute prayer meeting and rally.  "We are his people and we have the right to come see what we have done for him, even if he wants to act like he has forgotten," said Sharpton.<P>
	He pointed to Thomas' opinions in cases that overhauled federal affirmative action programs, voting rights and a school desegregation plan, calling Thomas an "Uncle Tom" and comparing him to the apostle Thomas, who demanded to see the marks of Jesus' crucifixion.<P>
	But Sharpton, a flamboyant publicity seeker, has it wrong.  He wants to claim Thomas' success for himself while, at the same time, bring him down to his level.  I think not.
	<P>Whether or not one agrees with Thomas' Supreme Court decisions, it is clear that he is being judged by a harsher standard than any other justice sitting on the high court.  Thomas is expected to make rulings which are in line with the civil rights establishment's agenda, even though he disagrees with their approach.  Having actually read Thomas opinions, I've concluded that he would like to bring an end to the racial categorization we have instituted for the last 30 years and bring us all into one tent of Americans--before it's too late.
	<P>Thomas may be ahead of his time.  His vision for black Americans may be one which will be reached in the next millennium, but certainly not with the help of the black elite.  In their view, blacks will remain perpetual victims.  They will never be able to compete on a level playing field, as long as they are outnumbered by white Americans.  
	<P>This distorted view not only gives no hope to today's young people, but is utterly false.  Over and over again, blacks have demonstrated that they can compete in all aspects of American life.  Thomas just doesn't want blacks to be automatically assumed to be inferior, and he rejects the notion that, in all things intellectual and economic, black Americans are simply outgunned at every turn.
	<P>I join Thomas in rejecting that notion.  And I will keep him in my prayers, as he may be paving the way for a brighter American future.

<h2>From the Publisher</h2>

<b>VOL. 7, NO. 9 SEPTEMBER 1995</b><br>
<img src="red-line.gif">
<p>
<p>
<p>

Hollywood and television are permeated with class, racial, gender, religious and other biases.  The more
time people spend watching television and movies, the more their impressions of the world seem to resemble
those of the self-created world of the media.<p>

     Stereotyping of blacks in the media is fairly well-known, although still influential in shaping images. 
Blacks are usually portrayed in films as either crooks, pimps, informers or persons needing assistance from the
government.  Television is not much better.<p>  

     In fact, in a book by Michael Parenti titled Make-Believe Media, the author describes black shows as
being slanted "toward the ridiculous with no redeeming counter-images."<p>

     And there are subtle alterations in these images.  As Parenti notes, when blacks are portrayed as
criminals, they often have leading roles.  When portrayed as police, they are more often in subsidiary roles.  "For
a while," writes Parenti of films in the 1980s, "no African-American male could survive to the end of a film."<p>

     While the stereotyping of blacks in Hollywood is rather obvious, the stereotyping of families and
Christians is not as easy to detect, but is harmful nonetheless.  Television programming and movies in the 1950s,
1960s and even 1970s more often included a nuclear family with father, mother and children fully aware of their
respective roles.  Adultery was depicted at a minimum and, usually, the guilty party suffered the consequences of
his or her actions.<p>

     Now it seems that the nuclear family is the exception, rather than the rule, in Hollywood.  I personally
have not watched sitcoms and the bulk of prime-time television in nearly 20 years, because I find it too shallow
for my taste.<p>

     But I have it on good authority that prime-time television today, with its loveless sex and misplaced
values, have had a deleterious effect on our culture.  Programs like ABC's "Roseanne" flaunt time-honored
values by putting a positive spin on homosexuality, premarital sex, illegitimacy, parental disrespect and anti-Christian bigotry.  Another ABC show, "My So-Called Life," focuses on life through the eyes of a 15-year-old
girl with a bisexual pal.  FOX programs "Married With Children" and "Martin" are risque with steamy sexually
themed storylines.<p>

     Daytime television is even worse as the programming line-up consists primarily of soap-operas with
virtually no happily married couples and sexual promiscuity run amok, along with sleazy talk shows which leave
nothing to privacy.<P>

     And media attack anyone who objects to the values--or lack thereof--they promote to our children as
right-wing, extreme, mean-spirited or dangerous.  Remember Dan Quayle?<P>

     Those of us who care about media stereotyping need to let our voices be heard.  Selective buying
campaigns and boycotting advertisers are one way to get Hollywood's attention.  But we need to take it a step
further.  We must develop our own media and promote positive images of ourselves.  Only then can we bring
some balance to the myriad of Hollywood stereotypes affecting us all.<p>

Over the past two decades, numerous research projects have been conducted concerning the plight of the cities. A myriad of magazine articles, newspaper editorials and television programs have been produced. Countless books on inner cities, edge cities and outer cities (suburbs) have been written also. In fact, public hand-wringing by social scientists and policy analysts about the crises in our urban areas has almost become a national pastime.<p>

Most of what has been written seems to be fairly clear about the problems of the cities, but few, if any, analyses appear to have ideas about solving cities' problems, especially without government programs.<p>

Much of the discourse about the pathologies which exist disproportionately in our major cities--be they unemployment, drug abuse, crime, teen pregnancy, illegitimacy, family breakdown, welfare dependence, poor education, etc. -- flows from the premise that, whatever the problem, there is a government program that can solve it.<p>

Elected officials at the municipal, county, state and national levels have submitted innumerable funding proposals for social welfare, housing, transportation, education, job training, drug treatment and small business projects, believing that money alone can solve the problem. But few have turned to what we call community-based problem solving.<p>

Community-based problem solving is one of the primary tenets of our magazine's political philosophy. We promote the ideal that, rather than look to the federal government to solve local problems, such as crime and education, we can and should develop solutions in our local communities.<p>

Let me explain how this works. First, residents in a community begin meeting with their neighbors to discuss specific problems. They form several groups to examine different aspects of the problem, then group leaders meet and develop a plan. Their planning development may include meeting with leaders from other nearby communities to exchange ideas and see how resources can be shared.<p>

The leaders then begin marshaling the resources to implement their plan, all at the local level. These resources may come from local businesses or the residents themselves. Government involvement should be a last resort, but can be sought if necessary.<p>

Community-based problem solving is bottom up, instead of top down. It operates at the grass roots level and uses a minimum amount of resources because there are no layers of bureaucracy.<p>

Once citizens start operating at the community level, they'll begin asking themselves why they need a big, expensive, intrusive, overbearing federal government in the first place. This is part of the devolution process we're seeing in Washington with the 104th Congress, although it is meeting great resistance from those who don't have faith in citizens to solve their own problems.<p>

When we solve our problems on a local level, then we can truly reduce the size of the bloated federal government. Wouldn't it be nice to stop sending so much of our money to Washington to Support distant bureaucrats who are eager to micro manage our lives? Would it be great to have a smaller federal government in exchange for lower taxes, less regulations and more responsibility at the local level? I think so, what about you?<p>

<p>
The Alan Keyes story is one which deserves a closer look.  At the beginning of the campaign season, most political analysts said Keyes would have little, if any, impact on the republican presidential nomination.  But they may be wrong.<p>

Keyes is the most credible candidate in the GOP field on the pro-family issues.  In private conversations with Christian conservatives, both black and white,the Keyes candidacy is resonating.<p>

When we attend GOP seminars and confrences, many people approach us and say positive things about the former ambassador's message and the intensity of his delivery.  his appeal is his passion for the issues -- particularly the issue of abortion.  Keyes has likened abortion to the moral dilemma faced by Republicans in the mid-1800's regarding the issue of slavery.  For Keyes, the two issues are morally equivalent.<p>

In fact, many Republicans, without prompting, tell us they believe Keyes is the only candidate who deserves their vote.<p>

But Keyes does not have the family issues all to himself.  Senate Majority Leader and presidential candidate Bob Dole struck a chord in recent weeks when he attacked Time Warner, Inc. for the violence, filth and foolishness the corporation promotes through movies and music.<p>

Dole, who is perceived as a Johnny-come-lately to this issue, has nonetheless gotten a lot of ink and air time with his attacks on Hollywood, including front-page stories in <i>The New York Times, Washington Post</i> and other major media.  Television coverage of Dole lambasting Hollywood has been prolific as well, with all major networks running stories.  Even <i>Time</i> magazine, which Time-Warner owns, did a cover story on the controversy.<p>

Although Keyes has not specifically addressed the issue of cultural images perpeuated through the media, he has been the strongest voice concerning getting the nation back on a moral course.  The question Keyes campaign operatives must be asking themselves is "How can we get this initiative back from Dole?"  The media have decided to cover Dole's approach to this issue, rather than Keyes' approach to this issue, even though Keyes was out front on the moral issues from the start.<p>

It's part of the media's tendency to declare someone a front-runner and, as a result of the declaration, give that person the majority of the media coverage.  Thus, the media's prediction becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.  In this era when the majority of voters receive their information on political candidates through the media in general, and via television in particular, how can a candidate break out of the pack if he or she receives no media coverage?<p>

Can Alan Keyes win?  Only those faithful to his campaign believe he has a chance of winning the nomination.  The two-time U.S. Senate candidate will have a tough time getting back on track, particularly if he cannot get back momentum from this major issue.<p>

But Keyes has one clar advantage and that is his oratorical skills.  Frankly, he is the best speaker in the entire pack of GOP presidential hopefuls.  Given the opportunity, he can outshine all the other candidates on the stump.  Winning the nomination may be a long shot, but he'll go far in winning the hearts and minds of conservative activists who dominate the Republican primary process.<p>

<p>
When we look at the educational mess in which we find ourselves, it can clearly be traced back to the interference of politicians and liberal social theorists. For the past 30 years, these pols and academicians have focused more on racial integration, multicultural diversity, and boosting self-esteem than they have on improving academic performance in our nation's public schools. As a result, academic standards, test scores and achievement ale lower and per-pupil costs have skyrocketed.<p>

Much of the focus on the failures of public education have concentrated on inner-city schools. But suburban schools have most of the same problems, although perhaps not quite as visible to the public eye. The one advantage suburban schools have ova those in urban areas is parental involvement. Because most suburban children come from two-parent families, at least one parent is available to participate in school activities, help with homework and consult with teachers and principals.<p>

It would seem that if more parental involvement is good for students, the public school system would welcome innovative ideas which would increase parental control and choice. However, the system has self-preservation as its primary objective, rather than educating students. That's the reason for all the hand-wringing whenever options like home schooling, charter schools and school choice are proposed.<p>

Teachers' unions and organized groups, like the National Education Association, spend millions to lobby (read arm-twist) state legislatures to maintain the status quo. Some even label efforts to change the way we educate our students as racist. In the state of Texas, for example, one of our state representatives said on the floor of the legislature that home-rule will resegregate the state's school system.<p>

Has he been to a Texas public school lately (or to any other school in the U.S., for that matter)? They're already re-segregated.<p>

My first concern, as is the concern of the overwhelming majority of American parents, is not who their child sits beside in the classroom, but whether or not their child is learning basic skills to be successful in adult life.<p>

My second concern is that all students be ready to take advantage of the new opportunities a good education will provide, as we prepare to compete internationally with compares in Europe and the Pacific Rim.<p>

Some wonder why Asian students (both in America and in Asia) tend to perform m better on standardized tests than do Americans. Could it be that Asian parents exercise more control over their children's academic performance, and place more significance on education?<p>

We Americans tend to place a great deal of emphasis on sport perhaps much more than is warranted All we have to do is observe the interest in this month's National Basketball Association playoffs. There are basketball courts in nearly every residential neighborhood and most evenings, when the weather cooperates, we see young men "hooping" on the courts. I wonder if they spend the same amount of time studying as they do sharpening their dunking skills?<p>

I encourage parents to instill in their children the idea that one can be a good athlete <b><i>and</i></b> a superior student.<p>

<h3>June 1996</h3><p>
<img src="red-line.gif">
<p>


<b>DOES AMERICA NEED A THIRD PARTY?</b><br>
   Support for a new, or third, political party is at an all-time high.  In the 1930s, support ranged from 13 to 14 percent of the populace; in the 1990s, between 55 to 65 percent back the notion of a third party, and 38 to 45 percent of voters are independent, not wedded to either major party, according to a recent poll conducted by the Gordon S. Black Corporation (GSBC).
<p>
   The polling firm's explanation for the increase in the market size of potential third party voters is that the major parties have moved progressively to the political left and right, thus leaving a vacuum for the concerns of moderate voters in the political center.  Politics, as does nature, abhors a vacuum.
<p>   
Still, the GSBC survey reveals even more fascinating findings.  A majority of voters (59 percent) say the current incumbents will never reform the political system; an overwhelming majority (79 percent) say special interest groups have more influence than voters; 74 percent say Congress is largely owned by special interest groups; and 44 percent say if Democrats and Republicans continue to run things, we will never get real reform.
<p>
   Perhaps even more telling, 61 percent of voters say they would vote for the candidates of a centrist reform party as opposed to Republicans and Democrats.
<p>   
But America still has a long way to go before it has a viable third party from which candidates are elected at all levels of government.  And the reasons are numerous.
<p>   
First, most voters are in the habit of voting for either Democrats or Republicans and these voting habits, or patterns, will not be easily changed.  The strongest possibility lies with younger Americans, who also are much less likely to vote than are their parents and grandparents.
<p>
   Second is the issue of credibility.  Because third parties and their candidates are considered to have little, if any, chance for victory, voters believe they may be wasting their votes if they cast it for these candidates.
   <p>
The concept of the wasted vote was expressed repeatedly by media during the 1992 presidential campaign when Perot ran as an independent candidate.
<p>
   Noted journalist Sam Donaldson's comments on ABC's "This Week With David Brinkley," Oct. 25, 1992, provides a glaring example of the media's standard position concerning the Perot campaign.
<p>   
"Well, let me tell you something about this election," said Donaldson.  "Some people say,  Vote for who you like best, even though they don't have a chance to win.'  I think that's wrong.  I think life is full of tough choices that are always--often second and third choices because the first choice doesn't make any sense."
<p>   
Later during that same broadcast, Donaldson added, "You can vote for a loser if you want to.  Now, you know--but if you want to have an impact on the election, there is a choice between Clinton and Bush."
<p>
   The idea of a vote for Perot being a wasted vote was repeated so much by the media that the Texas businessman felt compelled to address the issue in the presidential debates and in his 30-minute infomercials.
<p>
   This brings us to the third reason why it will be quite a while before third party candidates actually have a credible shot at political races.  Media generally dismiss them as "not viable" and provide them with little or no media exposure.  Thus, voters are not familiar enough with third-party challengers to make an informed decision one way or the other.  Their only option is to pick from among the tried and true--Democrats or Republicans.
<p>
   Fourth, and perhaps most important, is the issue of money, which has been described as the mother's milk of politics.  Currently, our political system is skewed in favor of the two major parties in terms of financial resources candidates and the two parties receive from the Federal treasury.
<p>
   The Federal Election Commission will give $12 million to each of the two major political parties for their 1996 presidential nominating conventions.  In addition, both the Clinton and Dole campaigns have received in excess of $12 million each in Federal matching funds during this election cycle.  The only third party presidential candidate who has received matching funds thus far is John Hagelin, nominee for the Natural Law Party, who has received $246,961.
<p>
   This edition of Headway includes commentaries by three individuals active in the political arena.  Reginald Jones, a New Jersey political commentator and part-time radio talk show host, says he's a conservative Republican who has been disillusioned by some of the GOP's political shortcomings.  Jones, however, believes the answer is to improve the two parties, not build a third one.
<p>
   Richard Toliver, who has written a number of commentaries for Headway in the past, is former southwest regional director for United We Stand America.  Toliver has some words of wisdom for the Reform Party, summarizing his comments by writing, "The Reform Party must be able to relate to those who are still denied an opportunity to achieve the American dream."
<p>
   Finally, Harry Browne is a presidential candidate running under the banner of the Libertarian Party.  He makes the case for why voters should take a look at his party and chose him as their alternative to the Democrat and Republican standard bearers.

<P>
There are probably as many definitions for the term conservative as there are faces on the cover of this edition of Headway.<P>
Websters defines 'conservative' as "disposed to preserve existing conditions, institutions, etc., and to agree with gradual rather than abrupt change."  But, the term is also defined as "a member of a conservative political party," which, in the U.S., is the Republican Party.  And leaders of todays GOP tend to be more interested in instituting sweeping, rather than incremental changes in the way government works.<P>
New York Times columnist William Safire, in his New Political Dictionary, says a conservative is a "defender of the status quo," a definition which is also inaccurate in the current political environment.  In fact, the Democrats are bigger defenders of the status quo than are the Republicans.<P>
Edwin J. Feulner, president of the conservative policy organization, The Heritage Foundation, describes conservatism as an intellectual movement which, over a 30-year period, blossomed into a political movement.  "Conservatisms next step--the one were in the midst of right now--is as a governing movement," said Feulner in his seventh annual essay on "The State of Conservatism," delivered on April 11.<P>
And that may be conservatives biggest problem: As they attempt to govern, they come under relentless assaults on their motives, character and intentions by media and the opposing party, so much so that they are more easily defined by others, than by themselves.<P>
Thus, the ugly definitions of conservative abound and the term becomes synonymous with derogatory expressions such as bigot, racist, mean-spirited, extreme and radical; individuals who want to give tax cuts to the rich and cut free lunch programs for the poor.<P>
Feulner has one explanation for why these loathsome terms may be resonating in some sectors of the electorate.<P>
"Perhaps the [conservative] message became too unfocused and thus susceptible to redefinition by the special interests and the media," he says.  "Those are understandable, forgivable mistakes.  I say, learn and move on."<P>
Maybe.  But moving on will not be a simple task as long as there is confusion about what exactly constitutes modern-day conservatism.<P>
Most mainstream conservatives today would say they believe more in the genuine power of the individual than they do in the misplaced and often intrusive power of the government.  They also believe government should live within its means; that there should be a safety net for the poor and disadvantaged, but not one that leads to dependency; that the free enterprise system is the best way to ensure long-term opportunity for all; and that America should maintain a strong defense to ensure peace and freedom within its borders.<P>
But there are extreme elements which have latched onto the conservative movement which do it more harm than good, because these segments tend to overshadow the positive aspects of conservatism.  What are some of these extreme elements?  David Duke is a good example.  Duke, who is a former Ku Klux Klan member in Louisiana and two-time gubernatorial candidate, hides behind conservatism to disguise his genuine racism toward blacks and others he considers to be unworthy of equal protection under the laws.<P>
Then there are militia groups, like the Freemen of Montana, who claim to be constitutionalists and use (or misuse) portions of the constitution when it is convenient.  But they selectively ignore American laws and believe they can declare an area within Americas borders as a separate country, simply because they say so.<P>
There are others who claim to advocate a color-blind society and equality of opportunity, yet they only protest discrimination when it occurs against white males, not against blacks, women or members of minority groups.<P>
When these extreme, and usually hypocritical elements abound within the conservative movement, there is no doubt that they will become larger than life and overpower the pro-America message that is conservatisms foundation.<P>
This edition of Headway includes commentaries by three activists within the conservative movement who provide their own definitions of conservatism.  Robert Woodson, president of the Washington, D.C.-based National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise, got involved in the conservative movement in the early 1970s, in part because he was disillusioned with liberals.  Woodson says conservatives have lost the battle of public perception, and provides his view on how this can be changed.<P>
Georgene Brazer, who is active in Republican political circles in the state of New Jersey, says true conservatism lies in the political center.  Brazer sees Ronald Reagans conservative vision as the embodiment of what is best about this contemporary movement.<P>
Clarence Carter, a former operative for the Republican National Committee, believes conservatism will labor under offensive definitions by others as long as it appears to be an exclusive, rather than inclusive, political force.  He recommends "diversifying the face of conservatism."

<h2>Editor's Roundup</h2><P>
<h3>April 1996</h3><p>

     It is a widely held conception that our two-party political system, with its attendant peaceful transfer of executive power, makes it one of the world's most stable and reliable.  Yet, with this stability, a significant portion of the American electorate has become restless, feeling that neither major party is filling the bill.  <p>
     In our February edition, we examined the Republican Party's apparent lack of balance in advocating getting the federal budget's house in order with an equal compassion for the less fortunate.  In this edition, we examine the Democrats' resistance to changing the way the federal government works, and a myopic view that all problems can be solved by simply implementing new government programs or instituting more expansive government regulations.<p>
     A classic example of the Democrats' proclivity for the status quo is contained in a Feb. 27 speech delivered by House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt to the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington, D.C.  The theme of the Missouri Congressman's remarks was job and wage insecurity, in particular, and the American economy in general.  Gephardt stayed true to form regarding the Democrats' world view and political approach.<p>
     First, the Democrats' strategy is to frighten the American public or capitalize on already existing fears.  In Gephardt's speech he described the "endangered middle class," implying that our nation's huge middle class is on the verge of extinction.  He also said "an estimated 1,200 Americans los(e) their jobs every single day," implying that they remain perpetually unemployed thereafter.<p>
     Yet, Clinton and Democrats have recently taken credit for millions of new jobs created since Clinton took office and a falling unemployment rate.  In other words, they are trying to have it both ways. 
     Second, while frightening the American public, Democrats identify the culprits causing such public angst as either Republican policies, "the rich," or "deep cuts" in programs which, in most cases, are not cuts at all, but simply decreases in the rate of growth.<p>
They then convince the American public that Democrats, through government programs and policies, can, in Gephardt's words, "guarantee a good life."  Based on Biblical teachings, even God does not guarantee us a good life.  But somehow Democrats want us to believe that they can. 
     <p>The President made a similar assessment in a Mar. 17 speech before the United Jewish Appeal, in which he said the government should "guarantee the American dream to everyone who wants it."  
   <p>  Democrats just don't understand that a guarantee and a dream are, by definition, mutually exclusive.  Also, dreams are individual, so how can the government guarantee each individual the dream he or she desires?
     <p>Another characteristic of the Democratic approach is that it operates under a false premise.  In the party's scenarios, business owners are always evil and workers are always virtuous.  Having served in both capacities for nearly equal amounts of time, I can honestly say this is completely inaccurate.
     <p>There are business owners who bend over backwards to protect their employees jobs and wages, and there are workers who are downright lazy and incompetent.  But the Democrats' scenarios never allow for the broad spectrum represented on both sides of the worker/management divide.
     <p>In his speech, Gephardt concluded that our political system is unresponsive, leading people to turn away from politics altogether.  But, truthfully, our political system and our politicians over promise and, when they don't deliver, people, in turn, become cynical.  The House Minority Leader is himself, perhaps unwittingly, an example of the very thing that is wrong with the system.  According to him and his fellow Democrats, the solution is always more government, but they consistently ignore the costs and impact of their proposals.
     <p>The principle that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction, seems to completely escape the realm of the Democrats' understanding.  It appears that they think their policies are enforced in a vacuum; that there is no resultant impact on corporate behavior, worker behavior or consumer behavior.  Either they are naive or ignorant, neither of which is a desirable trait.
     <p>For example, one of the proposals Gephardt advances as a solution to worker insecurity is to bar the federal government from offering contracts to companies that do not offer basic health and pension benefits to workers.  This sounds good, but it will have at least two immediate impacts.
    <p> One is to increase the dollar amount of all federal government contracts, since corporations which have generous benefits packages also charge higher prices for their services or products.  Another impact is that is will eliminate most small businesses from doing business with the federal government, since they generally cannot afford to provide health and pension benefits until they increase in size, revenues and profits.
    <p> In this edition of Headway, three contributors critique the Democratic Party.  All three have been Democrats themselves at one time or another, but two left the party within the last several years precisely because of its seemingly congenital attachment to government solutions.  The other calls himself a "lifelong, yellow dog Democrat," who is proud of the programs Democrats developed in the past and seems to be hopeful that the American public will turn to them in the future if times get tough.

National Minority Politics - Editor's Roundup - October 1995</title>
</head>
<body>
<h2>Editor's Roundup</h2><P>
<h3>October 1995</h3><p>
<img src="red-line.gif">
<P>

	In former Sen. John Danforth's (R-Mo.) book, <i>Resurrection: The Confirmation of Clarence Thomas</i>, the author explains how the youngest justice on the U.S. Supreme Court was able to get through the grueling final days before the Senate voted to confirm his nomination.  Danforth writes that Thomas collapsed emotionally under the onslaught.  "[Thomas] felt quite certain that no job, even one on the Supreme Court, was worth the feelings of annihilation he was experiencing," writes the retired senator.
<P>
	Danforth watched, counseled and consoled Thomas as he slowly and dramatically made his way back from the depths of utter hopelessness and self-doubt.  In the book, Danforth describes an unforgettable scene, in his office, in which the two couples, the Danforths and the Thomases, held hands and prayed for God's strength for Thomas, who had no strength of his own left.
	<P>
There is no doubt in my mind that Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has had to call upon that same divine strength on numerous occasions since his Supreme Court confirmation in 1991.  Since then, at least two unflattering books have been written about Thomas and the sexual harassment charges brought by Anita Hill, both by journalists.  <P>

	<i>Capitol Games</i>, written in 1992 by Timothy Phelps, the <I>Newsday</I> reporter who broke the Hill allegations, and Helen Winternitz, supposedly presents a behind-the-scenes investigative report, but their view is obviously slanted in Hill's favor.  According to the authors, they document how Thomas "positioned himself as a black conservative in Washington," and "how the radical Right backed his cause."<P>

	The other tome, <I>Strange Justice: The Selling of Clarence Thomas</i>, was written by Jane Mayer and Jill Abramson, a <i>Wall Street Journal</i> reporter.  The book cleverly attempts to paint Thomas as having an obsession with pornography and, by extension, being more likely to sexually harass his female employees. <P>
 
	But, interestingly, the writers only interview women who corroborate their assertion and do not interview the dozens of women who disagree; in other words, journalism with an agenda.  And Mayer and Abramson make the incongruous claim that "while the Republican senators defended Thomas, the Democrats were impartial factfinders, not Hill advocates."  It's no small wonder that Thomas declines all media interviews.<P>

	Besides being disparaged by book writers, Thomas has been harshly criticized and caricatured by leaders of the civil rights establishment.  Although many of them are men of the cloth, they appear to have little Christian charity for the associate justice.<P>
	Dr. Joseph Lowery, in his president's address to the 1995 convention of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, described the Supreme Court as having "three white males, one white female, and a whatchamacallit." <P>
 	On Sept. 12, political gadfly Rev. Al Sharpton and a few dozen ministers joined other protesters and picketed near Clarence Thomas' home.  Sharpton claimed this demonstration was in response to Thomas' Supreme Court decisions on affirmative action and majority-minority congressional districts. <P>

	The New York preacher appears to blame Thomas solely for the high court's opinions.  If Sharpton was consistent, which he generally is not, he would have picketed at the homes of all the Supreme Court justices who sided with the majority in those cases.  But Sharpton's objective was not consistency, but to question Thomas' "blackness."<P>
	Rep. J. C. Watts, a freshman Congressman from Oklahoma, says Thomas will likely have to labor under a double standard for years to come.  "I don't think Clarence Thomas will ever be treated fairly or will be judged by a level standard," Watts said in an August interview.<P>
	"There is a different standard that Clarence Thomas and most black conservatives will have to live by," Watts added.  "But I think it is very important that we continue to tout our message, because there are many people in the minority community who agree with us."<P>

	Three of those who agree, and also know Thomas personally, are included in this month's edition of <I>National Minority Politics</i>.  Armstrong Williams, who has known the associate justice for more than a decade and worked with Thomas at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission as his confidential assistant, details an exclusive conversation he had with Thomas after the recent court session ended.<P>

	John N. Doggett III has been a friend to Thomas for nearly 25 years.  The two were law students together at Yale University in the early 1970s.  Doggett, a Texas lawyer and business owner, testified on Thomas' behalf at the confirmation hearings.<P>

	Brian W. Jones, president of the Washington, D.C.-based think tank, the Center for New Black Leadership, met Thomas in the early 1990s.  "My first encounter with Thomas came during my senior year in college," writes Jones, who is in his late 20s.  Thomas had just been appointed to the U.S. Circuit Court by President Bush.<P>
	These three columns are some of the most revealing ever written about Thomas and his approach to the law, from people who know his personally, rather than from armchair psychiatrists who are ideologically opposed to the Supreme Court justice.<P>

<h2>Editor's Roundup</h2>
<h3>HOLLYWOOD STEREOTYPES</h3>
<p>
<img src="red-line.gif"><p>

     Hollywood--through both movies and television--does a good job of typecasting many entities and groups
throughout American society.  But three of the most egregious examples of Hollywood stereotyping involve its
images of blacks, families and Christians.<p>

     For blacks, the typecasting is especially deplorable.  In fact, because the stereotyping for blacks has gone
unchecked for so many years, many people mistakenly believe these images represent reality.  In movies and on
television, the images for blacks are extremely limited.  In films, black males are cast as either criminals, gangsters,
drug dealers or pimps, and females are usually the girlfriends of these male deviants.  The notable exception to this
pattern in films today is actor Denzel Washington, who is described in this edition of National Minority Politics by
writer Stanley Crouch as a modern-day Sidney Poitier.<P>

     Television for black images is hardly better, as Americans see blacks largely in comedic roles--sitcoms.  In
other words, seen through Hollywood's myopic prism, blacks are viewed in two theatrical extremes: comedies and
tragedies.  The depth and breadth of everyday drama, in which most blacks lead ordinary lives, is nearly nonexistent
in Hollywood productions. <P>

     Images of the American family are slightly better, but still outside the norm.  Motion pictures focus
relentlessly on family dysfunction and divorce, while television programs broadcast the virulent message that kids
know better than their old-fashioned and irrelevant parents.  In addition, commercial television regularly and
powerfully encourages casual sex, espousing the underlying message that sensuality is most satisfying when it is
shared outside of marriage, and that long-term relationships only serve to lessen the pleasure of the partners.<P>
     An analysis of television programming by S. Robert Lichter, Linda Lichter and Stanley Rothman reveals
that in addition to a spectacular increase in the amount of erotic activity in prime time, the context in which that
behavior occurs has shifted dramatically.  Prior to 1969, their tracking studies turned up references to sex outside of
marriage in only one out of every thirty shows on television's nightly lineup.  More recently, extramarital
experiences appeared in one show in six, and they report that the ratio "continues to narrow."<P>

     Another key element in the entertainment industry's attack on the family involves its relentlessly negative
portrayal of marital relationships.  In Hollywood's view of the world, marriage is an institution that is outmoded,
oppressive and frequently dangerous. <P>

     But no notion has been more aggressively and ubiquitously promoted in films, popular music and
television than the idea that children know best--that parents are unscrupulous, phony idiots who must learn decency
and integrity from their enlightened offspring.  Witness the animated FOX network program "The Simpsons," in
which the children wrestle with contemporary problems while getting sincere but useless, perhaps even detrimental,
advice from their parents.<P>

     Then there's Hollywood's abysmal treatment of people holding spiritual or religious beliefs.  A 1994
Harris poll showed almost all Americans believe in God (95 percent) and in heaven (90 percent).  Approximately
four out of five adults (79 percent) describe themselves as Christians.  More surprising than the total numbers
perhaps are the numbers of people who say they are not Christians who believe in some uniquely Christian beliefs.<P>

     Yet, we wouldn't know it from what we see in movies and on television.  Maybe this is due to the dearth of
religious conviction or affiliation among those who produce and create programming.<P>
  
     A 1983 Public Opinion survey of 104 of the most influential leaders of television's creative community
showed a full 45 percent who claim no religious affiliation whatsoever and an astounding 93 percent who say they
seldom or never attend religious services.<P>

     In an October 1991 interview with a Catholic newspaper in New York, veteran television producer John
Prizer conceded, "The lack of religious commitment on the part of people in Hollywood is quite astonishing.  I can't
think of a director or actor or writer under 45 who goes to church or synagogue."<P>

     Film critic Michael Medved, in his book, Hollywood vs. America, suggests that this lack of participation in
religious activities may account for many of the bizarre portrayals of men of God in film.<P>

     "Whenever someone turns up in a contemporary film with the title "Reverend," "Father," or "Rabbi" in
front of his name," writes Medved "you can count on the fact that he will turn out to be corrupt or crazy--or
probably both."<P>

     Since the only committed Christians many movie makers see regularly are television evangelists, they do
not get a balanced picture of what members of the clergy do on a daily basis.  The movie executives and producers
are more familiar with Jimmy Swaggert than they are with the working clergy in their local communities.<P>

     And there are more examples of religious imbalance in Hollywood.  In a 1992 study, professors from
Northwestern University, the University of Dayton, and Duke University Medical Center evaluated more than one
hundred productions on the four major networks for their religious content and images.  <P>

     They concluded that only 5.4 percent of the characters had an identifiable religious affiliation--although 89
percent of Americans claim affiliation with an organized faith.  In summing up their report, the researchers
concluded: "Television's treatment of religion tends to be best characterized as abuse through neglect."<P>

     This edition of National Minority Politics explores the subject of Holly-wood stereotyping.  As mentioned,
New York writer Stanley Crouch explains the historical evolution of black images in films and television, from the
early 1900s to the present.  Family Research Council president Gary L. Bauer discusses Hollywood's typecasting of
families and Christians.<P>

     After reading the commentaries by Crouch and Bauer, one may ask what can be done about these
inaccurate portrayals.  There are at least two answers.  One, we can let Hollywood know our displeasure through
calls and letters to producers, directors and script writers.  Two, we can affect the ratings of undesirable
programming by simply watching more appropriate programs or turning off the tube altogether.<P>

<h2>Editor's Roundup</h2><p>
<h3>Saving our Cities without government Programs</h3>
<img src="red-line.gif"><p>
<p>
<p>
One of the real tragedies of modern times is the lack of a  
historical perspective by those who were born in the late 1960s  
and 1970s concerning Americans' abilities to solve their problems  
individually, and with the help of family, friends and neighbors.   
Our sense of community and neighborhood has been lost, and young  
people today have little or no knowledge of how things were  
before a lot of community functions were usurped by local, state  
and national governments.  
<p>     
Often when I encounter young people and we get into a  
discussion concerning issues like welfare reform, job training  
and assistance to the poor, I present the argument that these  
issues can best be addressed with a greater emphasis on the  
private sector and neighbor helping neighbor.  The involvement of  
the federal government has been expensive and, in some cases,  
detrimental, resulting in unintended consequences.  
<p>
But these young adults often give me a puzzled look.  It  
seems they have no concept of how problems can be solved without  
the establishment of a government program.  And this should come  
as no surprise since, in their lifetimes, we have approached most  
national issues in this manner.  
<p>
Those of us who were born in the 1950s and before should  
consider ourselves lucky, because we remember how neighbors  
helped each other and did not rely upon the government for basic  
needs.  I can remember how our family would take clothes we had  
outgrown to needy neighbors, and share food with them as well.  
<p>     
Our church played a major role in the community also, as  
parishioners would contribute whatever they could spare to help  
those who were less fortunate.  Hardly anyone we knew was well  
off financially; most were from middle class and working class  
families.  But collectively those items and monies donated made a  
difference for a lot of families during hard times.  
<p>
Young people today simply have no memory of this sort of  
thing; in fact, it's totally foreign to their sensibilities.   
They've bought into the liberal notion that we should first look  
to the government when we encounter an obstacle.  
<p>
For example, if a young person needs a job, setting up a  
government job assistance program is the way most liberal  
politicians would approach it.  The bureaucrats' method is to  
establish a special agency just for this purpose.  Identify those  
teens who need jobs, identify those employers who might be  
hiring, hire analysts to study the results, and administrators to  
police the project.  This is very expensive.  
<p>     
The conservative approach is to have a parent, local teacher  
or neighbor encourage that young person to look for work on his  
own, in his own neighborhood.  He or she can even become  
entrepreneurial, offering babysitting, yard work or cleaning  
services to people in his or her community for an agreed upon  
price.  Or he or she can ask a local merchant or small business  
owner if they need assistance during the summer months and after  
school.  
<p>     
No bureaucrats involved, no expense to the taxpayers and,  
more importantly, the young person learns an important lesson in  
the process--how to sell his or her skills while seeking  
employment.  But it is interesting that, in the current political  
environment, those of us who advocate local solutions are accused  
of lacking compassion.  It seems that compassion is no longer  
measured by how effective a system or process is, but by how much  
money is taken from a large pool of taxpayers to address a  
problem, even if the solutions do not work.  
<p>     
As author Marvin Olasky wrote in his book, The Tragedy of  
American Compassion, the problems "seem intractable because so  
many things, costing so much money, have been tried so often  
without success."  
<p>     
In fact, it seems that the plight of the poor is often used  
as a camouflage for spending billions of dollars to make it more  
convenient to be poor, rather than showing the poor how to earn a  
middle class income.  
<p>     
There is a simple formula to upward mobility in America:  
Stay in school and get a good education; take a job, any job, no  
matter how much it pays, as a first step toward employment  
opportunities; and delay childbearing until marriage.  An  
emphasis on this common sense formula would go a lot further than  
all the government programs that we can develop over the next 20  
years.  
<p>     
Of course, there is a role for government.  There are some  
instances where government involvement is necessary, but again it  
should be a last resort, not the first option.  
<p>     
For those who are unfamiliar with private alternatives to  
public assistance, this edition of National Minority Politics  
will be a real eye-opener.  Robert L. Woodson, founder and  
president of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise,  
provides an insightful analysis of the difference in approaches  
between government programs and community-based initiatives.    
<p>    
Woodson is very specific about why government initiatives  
are a less desirable option than are projects derived from  
indigenous community sources.  He cites an example of a  
successful project in the Columbia Heights neighborhood of  
Washington, D.C., which he describes as a "virtual oasis" in the  
nation's capital.  
<p>
Deroy Murdock, economics and government correspondent for  
National Minority Politics, searched from coast to coast and  
found several inspiring examples of how the private sector can  
best the state in aiding the disadvantaged and building their  
communities.  One such program called Fridays in Portland, Ore.,  
is a job training project which takes no government funds on the  
notion that if welfare makes individuals dependent, it must do  
the same to organizations.  
<p>     
Murdock's findings should encourage us all to be more  
creative in our quest for a better society and rely less on  
Washington-based solutions.

<h2>Editor's Roundup</h2><p>


<h3>CAN ALAN KEYES WIN?</h3>
<img src="red-line.gif"><p>
Alan Keyes, as the conventional wisdom would have it, is the quintessential also-ran in the race for the Republican presidential nomination.  He's never been elected to public office, holds beliefs which would be characterized by some as "far right, hosts a syndicated radio talk show and served in the Reagan administration.  He's a committed Christian (Catholic) and is strongly pro-life.<p>

Oddly enough, that description fits, almost to a tee, another presidential candidate--Pat Buchanan.  The only difference is that Buchanan made a run for
the presidency in the 1992 election cycle. But that was Buchanan's first bid for office.  Keyes has run twice before, for the U.S. Senate in Maryland, and lost.  Yet he
got just as big a percentage of Republican votes as Buchanan did three years ago.<p>

It appears Keyes is one of those kinds of candidates whose role in the campaign
is hard for the media to pinpoint. Therefore, they simply choose to ignore him.<p>

When Keyes first announced his candidacy, I received several calls from media representatives who wanted to know my opinion of his national political debut.  They just couldn't understand how Keyes could be anything other than a "black" candidate.<p>

"Isn't he running to galvanize black Republicans?" one reporter asked me in a telephone interview.  When I responded that Keyes' support was coming primarily from pro-life advocates, most of whom were white Christians, the reporter seemed dumbfounded.<p>

Because of the way our national political campaigns have been waged in the past, she just could not envision a black candidate getting significant support from  anything other than black voters.  She expected Keyes to be sort of a Republican
Jesse Jackson.<p>

In reality, I told the reporter, Keyes is making a smart move.  There are presently not enough blacks in the Republican Party (in national polls, only 5 percent identify themselves as Republicans) to make that much difference in the primary process.<p>

But pro-life voters number in the millions and have a disproportionate impact during the GOP presidential primaries.  They are well-organized and passionate about their cause.  And many believe Keyes is the best vehicle for channeling that passion into clout at the 1996 Republican convention.<p>

In fact, when Keyes speaks at conservative or Republican events, he always revs up the crowd and leaves them wanting more.<p>

Keyes may have significant grassroots support but, so far, that support does not
show up in national polls.  In every national poll of registered Republicans I've seen, he either receives 1 percent support or not enough to even register on the radar screen.<p>

But polls can be misleading.  Several of the Republican primaries are in the form of caucuses, which give candidates like Keyes--who don't have a lot of name identification but have spirited supporters who are willing to stick with their guy (or
gal) during the primary process--an edge.<p>

In 1988, Sen. Bob Dole won the Republican vote in Iowa, followed by Christian broadcaster Pat Robertson, who won almost 25 percent of the vote and
pushed then-vice president George Bush into third place.  Robertson's showing
enabled him to grab the spotlight.<p>

A big question this year is how this large, powerful bloc of conservative Christian voters who backed Robertson in 1988 will break in 1996.<p>

If Keyes can do reasonably well in some of the early caucus states and stay in
the race through at least the first round of contests, he and his supporters may have
an impact on shaping the debate at the convention.<p>

If he does, success will have its price.  Thus far, Keyes has not received very much media scrutiny because he is not considered a major player.  However, as other presidential candidates can confirm, being toward the front of the pack takes its toll.
Media start delving into the backgrounds of candidates they consider "viable," digging up dirt and, in many cases, casting a shadow on a person's reputation where none existed before.<p>

In Keyes' case, the fact that he paid himself several thousand dollars a month out of his campaign funds during his 1992 senate race will raise eyebrows.  And the former
ambassador still has a campaign debt left over from that election. Lingering campaign debts are certainly nothing new in politics.  But media have a way of making indiscretions or mistakes appear worse than they actually are.<p>

Yes, Keyes has a tough row to hoe.  His campaign faces a Catch-22.  If voters believe he can't win, they'll likely cast their ballots for someone else to avoid "wasting"
their votes.<p>

Whether or not he wins, he may have already succeeded in one regard. His candidacy demonstrates that a black politico can run nationally on the basis of ideology or issues, rather than race.<p>

This edition of National Minority Politics includes an exclusive interview with
the candidate himself.  To give added insight into how he's faring with the party
faithful, Sharon Brooks Hodge, NMP's social/cultural correspondent, followed
Keyes around during the North Carolina Republican convention.  Hodge spoke
with those who support Keyes, to find out why, and she also talked to those
who are skeptical, to get their take on his campaign.<p>

Finally, Deborah Burstion-Donbraye,  a Maryland writer and former media relations specialist during the Reagan administration, assesses Keyes' impact from the
state where he ran his two Senate campaigns. Burstion-Donbraye says the
candidate is "still unspoiled by compromises."<p>

<h3>Education Revolution:</h3>
<b>Home Schooling Choice Schools find School Choice</b><p>
<img src="red-line.gif"><p>

It appears that hardly anyone is pleased with the current state of our
public education system. We seem to be paying more and getting less.<p>

A few weeks ago National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) scores were released and revealed that national reading scores have dropped for high school seniors. Only about a third of seniors were rated proficient readers, a significant decrease from the same test two years earlier.<p>

Yet the national per-pupil average we spend to educate our children continues to increase fairly rapidly, and is now $6,100. And only 52 cents of the average dollar spent on public education gets into the classroom. Where does the rest go? Nobody knows.<p>

School systems typically have only a vague idea of how much goes where. When Christine Todd Whitman, New Jersey's Republican governor, recently instituted a new accounting system that disclosed costs, school districts discovered they were spending $3,000 to S6,000 per student every year for administration alone.<p>

A survey accompanying the 1994 NAEP test found that, compared to seniors who took the 1992 test, students were less likely to: read for fun on their own time, read more than 11 pages per day, or be asked at least once at school to discuss something they read.<p>

Education Secretary Richard W. Riley said the results indicate students are spending "too much time watching mind-numbing television."<p>

And the test results get worse. About 30 percent of the seniors failed to reach even basic, which denotes "partial mastery" of the reading skills they should have. Two years ago, that figure was 25 percent.<p>

Fewer than 5 percent of any grade reached the advanced level. The decline in 12th-grade reading scores seemed almost universal -- the average scores dropped for both girls and boys; for whites, blacks and Hispanics; for private school students as well as public school students.<p>

But there was a notable trend: Scores for the top quarter of students remained the same. The decrease came from those in the middle and, most especially, at the bottom of the achievement scale.<p>

One problem may be that only students who wanted to be admitted to a top university are required to achieve, said Chester Finn, a member of the test governing board. The rest "aren't obligated to read," he said.<p>

Ten states showed significant declines in reading proficiency. No state showed significant improvement in average scores.<p>

One would think that these results would signal a receptivity for innovation and educational reform. Parents seem ripe for change.<p>

And in some cases, transformation has taken place. But it's usually on the micro, rather than a macro, level. Change comes from the bottom up, not the top down, and often meets significant resistance from teachers' unions and administrators.<p>

Take Milwaukee, which has the nation's 15th-largest urban school district, for example. While politicians and pundits make much of vouchers, or school choice, Milwaukee is the only place in the country that actually has such a program.<p>

In 1991, an unusual coalition of supporters--Republican and Democrat, rich and poor-made the voucher program law. It allows up to 1.5 percent of Milwaukee's student population, about 1,500 students, to apply for slots at 12 private schools. For each student taken in, 830 this school year, the state pays $3,209 a year. The rest is paid by parents or through fund-raising.<p>

Howard Fuller, who was appointed superintendent of Milwaukee's public schools in 1991, revolutionized the system by allowing schools to control more of their funds. Before, the central administration had power over a school's entire budget. Now, it controls roughly 80 percent, and Fuller wanted to go further.<p>

"You have to break up the monopoly," Fuller said in a Business Week interview in mid-April. "All of the adults have been organized to protect their interests. You run into union contracts, board mandates, state mandates, and the tremendous intangible--the way it's always been done."<p>

But on April 18, Fuller abruptly resigned, angrily blaming ''powerful forces of the status quo" for impeding further progress. Unions fumed over proposals to close failing schools and start charter schools free of district control. The result: inertia.<p>

There are some bright spots, however. It is clear that parents want more control over their children's educational destinies. A virtual education revolution is taking place at the community level.<p>

Many parents, like Barry Brooks of the Texas Home School Coalition, have decided to educate their children at home --with a positive outcome. Others, like Vernon Robinson of the North Carolina Education Reform Foundation, have formed grassroots organizations to fight for the implementation of charter schools and vouchers Still others, like Jacqueline Joyner Cissell, are working with other parents in Indianapolis, Ind. to make sure parents' concerns are heard by administration officials.<p>

Brooks, Robinson and Cissell each tell their stories in this month' s edition of National Minority Politics.<p>

National Center for Policy Analysis 
Saving the Medicare System with Medical Savings Accounts 
September 15, 1995
</center><p>
 
Earlier this year, the National Center for Policy Analysis addressed 
the Medicare financing crisis with a proposal similar to the one now 
being considered by the Republican leadership in Congress.  Under this 
plan, the elderly would be given a voucher allowing them to obtain 
coverage from a full range of private sector options, including a 
Health Maintenance Organization (HMO).  However, the most interesting 
option would be catastrophic insurance paired with a Medical Savings 
Account (MSA).  
<p>
Patient power through Medical Savings Accounts.  
 Under the MSA alternative, the elderly would have catastrophic 
insurance plus a Medical Savings Account.  They would control more of 
their own health care dollars without answering to a health care 
bureaucracy and would likely become more value-conscious shoppers in 
the health care marketplace.  
<p>
What could private insurers do with voucher money?  Milliman & 
Robertson analyzed the cost of high-deductible policies with and 
without a managed care element for Medicare beneficiaries and 
estimated the amount of money that would remain for the MSA.  
According to the analysis:

<p>Without managed care, private insurers could put about $1,500 in a 
Medical Savings Account for each beneficiary and the insurance policy 
would pay for all expenses above $3,000.
<p>
With managed care, private insurers could put about $2,100 in a 
Medical Savings Account and pay for all medical bills above $3,000. 
[See Figure I.]
<p>
Protection against health care costs. 
 One problem with the current Medicare system is that it leaves 
seniors exposed to thousands of dollars in catastrophic health care 
expenses.  By contrast, the MSA plan would allow beneficiaries to 
obtain real catastrophic insurance.
<p>
For example, more than 418,000 Medicare beneficiaries currently pay 
more than $5,000 out of pocket every year.  Under the plan illustrated 
in Figure I, their out-of-pocket expenses could not exceed about $900 
in 1996.
<p>
Cash refunds for being prudent purchasers of care.  Under the current 
Medicare system, if a patient does something to eliminate waste, the 
benefit of that action goes to the government.  But under the MSA 
option, elderly patients who make wise and frugal choices would 
realize financial benefits.  They would keep any money they had not 
spent at the end of each year.  Thus, Medicare beneficiaries would 
receive up to $2,100 a year in cash.
<p>
Coverage for prescription drugs and other services.  Under the current 
system, Medicare does not pay for most prescription drugs and this 
leaves the elderly at risk for limitless pharmaceutical expenses.  But 
under the MSA plan, beneficiaries could have coverage for services not 
currently covered by Medicare by accepting a modest decrease in their 
MSA balance.  For example, the voucher plan would allow private 
insurers to extend coverage to drugs and other items.  Instead of a 
$2,100 MSA deposit, people could have drug coverage and receive a 
Medical Savings Account deposit of about $1,500. 
<p>
Meeting the congressional budget goals without any loss of benefits.  
A peer-reviewed analysis by Milliman & Robert-son demonstrates that 
this proposal for reforming Medicare could save $270 billion over the 
next seven years, and that Medicare beneficiaries would get more - not 
less - protection against health care costs.  Specifically, a voucher 
plan allowing the elderly to switch from Medicare to Medical Savings 
Accounts and catastrophic health insurance would save as much as $195 
billion without any other changes.
<p>
Extending the program to the disabled and making modest reductions in 
the amount of the voucher would save an additional $40 billion.  
<p>
Such options as means-testing benefits by requiring the highest-income 
elderly to pay higher premiums or increasing the age of eligibility 
(currently 65) by one month per year would save at least $30 billion 
more.  
<p>
More savings and an economic boost. 
<p> Currently, Medicare costs are growing faster than private sector 
health care costs, causing medical inflation for everyone.  [See 
Figure II.]  Less health care spending by the elderly would ease the 
pressure on all medical prices and slow the rate of increase in health 
spending.  Using the National Center for Policy Analysis/Fiscal 
Associates Health Care Model, the NCPA finds that by the year 2005, 
Medicare spending would be 18 percent lower than currently projected 
spending, and total U.S. health care costs would be 8.7 percent lower.  
Spending on all health care would decrease by $186 billion and the 
output of other goods and services would increase by $241 billion.
<p>
Best news of all:  seniors would benefit.  This MSA plan is better 
than traditional Medicare in at least five ways:
<p>
<ul><li>The plan provides full coverage for expenses over the deductible, 
while Medicare leaves seniors exposed to catastrophic expenses that 
could devastate their savings.  
<p>
<li>With the MSA, out-of-pocket exposure could be virtually eliminated 
by encouraging the 70 percent of the elderly now paying for private 
Medigap insurance to contribute their Medigap premiums (about $1,200 
per year) to their MSA.
<p>
<li>The MSA funds could be used to pay for health expenses such as 
prescription drugs, which are not covered by Medicare.
<p>
<li>At the end of the year, the beneficiaries could withdraw and spend 
their remaining MSA funds for any purpose, thus sharing directly in 
the reward for keeping Medicare costs down.
<p>
<li>People with MSAs plus catastrophic insurance would be free from 
Medicare rationing restrictions and from concerns about quality of and 
access to care.

This Brief Analysis was prepared by NCPA President John Goodman, 
Senior Fellow Peter Ferrara and Health Policy Director Merrill 
Matthews Jr.  
<p>
Institute Description
<p>
The National Center for Policy Analysis is a nonprofit, nonpartisan 
public policy research institute founded in 1983 and internationally 
known for its studies on public policy issues. It draws on an 
international network of academic advisors, including several Nobel 
Prize winners, to address the most critical policy issues in the 
world. Additionally, the NCPA has several policy experts readily 
available for media inquiries.
<p>
The Center concentrates on health care, tax and environmental issues. 
It is probably best known in the U.S. for its work on tax policy and 
health policy. The NCPA is the only private sector organization that 
prepares a formal forecast of every major bill before Congress. The 
NCPA's concept of Medical Savings Accounts has been endorsed by more 
than 150 members of Congress as the alternative to the Clinton health 
reform plan. And, the NCPA's task force report on pro-free-enterprise 
approaches to environmental problems is being republished in countries 
around the world.
<p>
The NCPA was founded by John C. Goodman, an economist who serves as 
its president, and the late Sir Anthony Fisher. It's primary goal is 
to, "discover and promote private alternatives to government 
regulations and control, solving problems by relying on the strengths 
of the competitive, entrepreneurial private sector."

BRAVO, BILL ARCHER
</font></bold><br><p>
  
<font size=+1><bold>W</font></bold>ays and Means Committee Chairman Bill Archer is poised to become the greatest
leader of the most powerful panel in the House of Representatives since that committee
was established in 1795.  Archer plans to remake the entire U.S. economy in his image
by writing a brand-new tax code for enactment on January 1, 1998.  With those great
stakes, and that looming deadline, Archer knows he had better do it right.<p>
  <center><bold>Serious Study</bold></center><p>
  <font size=+1><bold>T</font></bold>he first step in doing something right from scratch is to study the alternative possibilities.  This Archer has begun to do with great solemnity.  On June 6-8, Archer
convened his panel to hear testimony on the national sales tax, the value-added tax
(VAT), the Nunn-Domenici USA Tax, and variants of the Hall-Rabushka flat tax, such as
those proposed by Majority Leader Dick Armey, Presidential candidate Senator Arlen
Specter, and freshman Rep. Mark Souder.<p>
  <font size=+1><bold>T</font></bold>he results were instructive.  First, the only proposal that underwent direct attack
was the flat tax.  These came mostly from ranking Democrat Rep. Sam Gibbons,
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, and Assistant Secretary of the Treasury Leslie
Samuels, an Administration spokesman.  No attack was particularly credible.
  Second, despite a scolding from Archer, the Administration refuses to come up with
a plan, though rumors of White House interest in a "flatter" tax perhaps like the one
Gephardt promised in a forthcoming proposal persist.  Remember that White House
Chief of Staff Leon Panetta actually introduced a Hall-Rabushka variant of his own in
1982.  Last week the White House introduced a balanced budget plan  to the
consternation of Congressional Democrats.  Is a Clinton flat tax next?<p>
  <center><bold>No Sales Tax Bill</bold></center><p>
  
<font size=+1><bold>T</font></bold>hird, there is still no actual bill for a national sales tax.  At least one bill expected in
April has failed to materialize, though Reps. Billy Tauzin and Dan Schaefer suggested
their bill might be ready soon.  Why the lag?  The exceptional workload undertaken by
this Congress may be one reason, but the vast engineering difficulties inherent in
creating a credible national sales tax may be another.  The reticence of sales tax
supporters to present any more than an outline plan recalls that of the theoreticians
who constructed the USA Tax.  So long as the proposal remained an abstract exercise,
one took it seriously.  The moment the USA Tax authors revealed their plan would
impose a 40 percent marginal tax rate on single taxpayers' incomes as low as $21,350 -
- less than the earnings of a first-year Congressional aide -- the proposal died.
  Fourth, and most importantly, all are willing to learn.  Aside from a testy exchange
between Archer and witness Jack Kemp, who incurred the Chairman s displeasure by
forthrightly stating that a VAT would  Europeanize  the American economy, the
hearings generally showed goodwill and serious intent by most participants.  
  Curiously, a lot of learning remains to be done.  Some members of the panel clearly
do not understand the difference between a "consumption tax" and an "income tax", or
between a "progressive tax" and graduated rates.  Archer must see that they do.  If he
is successful, his place in history is secure.<p>

<center><bold>Tax Cut Total:  $245 Billion</bold></center><p>
  <font size=+1><bold>I</FONT></BOLD>n the House-Senate Budget conference, conferees have reached agreement on an
aggregate tax cut number -- $245 billion -- but will leave specifics on most tax cuts to
committees involved in the reconciliation process.  Congress will vote on the plan next
week.
  <font size=+1><bold>I</FONT></BOLD>n announcing the agreement Thursday evening, Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole and
House Speaker Newt Gingrich itemized certain tax cuts which they believe will be enacted
with the passage of a reconciliation bill.  These include a $500 per child tax credit for most
families, capital gains and estate tax relief, IRA s for non-working spouses, small business
tax relief, and possibly some reduction in corporate alternative minimum tax.  According
to staff sources, the family tax credits would be capped but permanent.<P>  
  <font size=+1><bold>T</FONT></BOLD>he budget agreement will contain more detail than the typical conference report but
less detail than in the House and Senate budget resolutions and committee reports.  The
agreement will make reference in places to committee report language, but the GOP
Leadership s list of illustrative tax cuts will not be made more specific.<P>  
  <font size=+1><bold>T</FONT></BOLD>he budget agreement walks a narrow  line in balancing family tax relief with incentives
for savings, investment, and economic growth.  Both pro-family and pro-business tax
credits will be needed to maintain the broadbased coalition which has supported the new
GOP majority in enacting provisions of the Contract with America to date.<P>
  <font size=+1><bold>T</FONT></BOLD>he budget agreement calls for $983 billion in spending cuts to provide tax relief while
still balance the budget by the year 2002.  Only the Commerce Department will be
eliminated, while defense spending will be up slightly.  
The agreement appears to reflect House demands for an aggregate total of spending
cuts while preserving the Senate's choices for actual spending cuts.<p>

Testimony
</font></bold><br><p>

<center><bold>Two Strikes Against VAT
</bold></center><P>  <font size=+1><bold>I</FONT></BOLD>n his testimony before the Ways and Means Committee June 7, a leading European
authority on the VAT said that a 20 percent rate would be necessary to replace the U.S.
personal and corporate income taxes.  Dr. Sijbren Cnossen of Erasmus University in the
Netherlands made two additional points which deserve further notice.<p> 
  <font size=+1><bold>F</FONT></BOLD>irst, Cnossen advocates a phase-in period during which both the VAT and income tax
would apply.  Otherwise, economic dislocations would be considerable.  Announcement
effects alone would be  enormous,  he said.<p>  
  <font size=+1><bold>S</FONT></BOLD>econd, Cnossen stated that a transactional VAT which is  unambiguously assessible 
to specific products would be necessary in order to comply with WTO provisions.  This
would apparently rule out the possiblity of a border-adjustable, subtraction-method VAT
as proposed by Rep. Sam Gibbons.<p> 
  <font size=+1><bold>T</FONT></BOLD>he June  5 Joint Committee on Taxation staff document describing reforms proposals
likewise states that it is  not clear  whether a subtraction-method VAT could be made
border adjustable under GATT rules and notes there is no test-case precedent for doing
so.<p>

<P><h2>Mission Statement</h2></center>
<p>
Progress is the belief that Mankind has advanced in the past, is presently
advancing, and will continue to advance through the foreseeable future.<p>

No idea is more American, no idea has played a more central role in the
development of Western, and more recently, American Civilization. No idea is more
important to our collective future, and no idea has suffered more from the
cultural nihilism of the past 30 years than the idea of progress.<p>

America's Founding Fathers were unwavering disciples of the idea of progress<p>

But theirs' was a special brand of progress. They understood history, to borrow
Hegel's words, as "none other than the progress of the consciousness of freedom,"
and they placed their own concept of freedom at the heart of the American
Declaration -- in the "self-evident" proposition that "all men are created equal;
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights; that
among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."<p>

From John Adams, who wrote that the American Revolution occurred first "in the
hearts and minds of the people," to G.K. Chesterton ("America is the only nation
in the world founded on a creed") to Margaret Thatcher ("No other nation has been
built upon and idea"), it has always been clear that America's identity
transcends geography and ethnicity. Historians have devoted thousands of pages to
explaining our nation's history as the history of her ideas, and if we can be
certain of one thing, it is that America's future will be determined by the
future of her ideas.<p>

The challenge we face is to describe for ourselves and our progeny the historical
underpinnings, economic principles, cultural mores and practical implications of
the next incarnation of the American Idea. We will be judged by our sons and
daughters on our success at renewing, reapplying and passing on the core values
of the American Creed.<p>

That explains the mission of The Progress & Freedom Foundation: To restore, to
renew and to recreate America's sense of its future, a future woven inextricably
with the ideas of progress and freedom. It has been said that "The best way to
predict the future is to create it." Creating ideas that will define America's
future is what the Foundation has set about to do since its inception in April
1993.<p>

The Foundation is a private, non-profit, non-partisan idea center organized under
<a href="http://www.ustreas.gov/treasury/bureaus/irs/irs.html">Section 501(c)(3)</a> of the Internal Revenue Code.

<P>
Again, in the course of the welfare debate, the abortion issue
has demonstrated its unique capacity to mobilize and divide.
<P>
Pro-life advocates who resist the so-called family cap, which
would freeze benefits to mothers who bear additional illegitimate
children while on welfare, fear that the cap could promote an
increase in abortions.  Pro-life advocates who support the measure
share both this concern and the long-term goal of driving abortions
to the point of zero.  Unlike the more conventional conflict between
pro-life and pro-choice groups, pro-life differences over the
family cap represent a dispute over means, not ends, that is complicated
by the absence of any hard data from actual experimentation.
<P>
Such differences lend themselves to reasoned discussion and, ultimately,
resolution far more easily than the larger debate for and against
abortion rights, which Laurence Tribe has characterized as a &quot;clash
of absolutes.&quot;  While the choice between life and death cannot
be accurately described as a &quot;clash of absolutes,&quot; the
phrase does capture usefully the impossibility of winning adherents
to the pro-life cause without first changing hearts, one at a
time.  We should forfeit no battles, but neither can we expect
to win the war against abortion on demand without a comprehensive,
long-term strategy to develop and sustain a pro-life consensus.
<P>
While a pro-life position must be part of the agenda for national
renewal, opposition to abortion must be only one plank of the
pro-life platform.  A crisis as broad and deep as abortion on
demand requires a transformation of the political and moral culture
as well as a reform of law.  Reducing illegitimacy is the <I>sine
qua non</I> of moral reconstruction; and right-to-life activists
should realize that, as one of the few weapons in the anti-illegitimacy
arsenal, the family cap not only serves their cause in the long
term but deserves their active support in the short term.
<P>
Even assuming that our ultimate objective is to save as many lives
as possible, it is by no means clear that the appropriate operational
measure of success in assessing the family cap would be the number
of lives saved in the short term -- if such a number could be
approximated in the future as it cannot be now.  The question
itself is a red herring because it obscures the larger and more
important 
issue: &quot;What constitutes progress toward ending altogether
the culture that finds abortion acceptable?&quot;
<P>
To increase the logic and appeal of pro-life arguments to a significant
number of people who do not now see the moral force in such arguments,
we must begin the task of rebuilding civil institutions that will
nourish human souls and liberate them to fulfill their full potential.
 Such an ambitious project will require a multifaceted strategy,
and eliminating the welfare benefits that encourage illegitimacy
must be a key component of that strategy.
<P>
The real fault-line in the current welfare debate is not between
pro-life social conservatives and economic libertarians.  Rather,
the crucial dispute pits those who think relimiting government
is a prerequisite for moral reform against those who believe that
the size of government bears no relation to cultural decay.
<P>
Most of the outspoken pro-life opponents of welfare reform do
not deny that reducing illegitimacy will reduce abortions.  Instead,
they deny that welfare subsidies increase illegitimacy.  The blame
belongs exclusively, they say, to &quot;the sex-drenched culture.&quot;
<P>
Yet, in a perverse twist of logic, the same pro-lifers also maintain
that abortion rates respond quite sensitively to small changes
in the size of cash benefits.
<P>
If man is more than a material being, then it is not unreasonable
to expect some individual moral decisions to override the economic
incentives that run against the grain of virtue.  Nor is it implausible
to suggest that, of all the choices an individual mother must
make, the decision to abort her child -- the most galvanizing
moral issue of our day -- is the one <I>least</I> likely to respond
to economic policy variables.  To suggest otherwise, in fact,
is to assert a particularly virulent form of economic determinism,
with the implication that morality is little more than a product
of rational choices in response to dollar incentives.
<P>
Thus, some pro-life advocates arrive at the argument that government
must pay women not to have abortions.  And while they advocate
incentivizing virtue, they are unwilling to give any credence
to the suggestion that welfare's economic incentives encourage
vice -- including abortion.
<P>
Cultural conservatives believe the diametric opposite: Public
policy can undermine, but never instill, virtue because government
cannot be an effective moral teacher.  Rather than attempting
to devise the perfect bundle of carrots and sticks to reward virtue
and penalize vice, we must eliminate altogether the government
subsidies that skew welfare recipients' decisions by shielding
them from the natural economic consequences.
<P>
Getting government out of the way, of course, is the theme that
unites social conservatives and economic libertarians.  The vast
majority of pro-life social conservatives support restrictions
on welfare benefits, while the majority of pro-lifers who oppose
reform couple their concerns about abortion with a commitment
to big government.
<P>
Failure to understand the real source of the pro-life dispute
now threatens to obscure the critical nexus between morality and
freedom from government intervention.  Misunderstanding the relationship
between morality and freedom in turn threatens both the moral
authority of limited government and the efficacy of cultural reform.
<P>
The Founders instituted a limited government to secure natural
rights, including the right to life; but as George Will noted
in a recent editorial, &quot;Our creed of limited government has
a corollary vision of human capacities and of the life worth living,&quot;
captured by the phrase &quot;pursuit of happiness.&quot;
<P>
The Founders would have scoffed at the notion that the protection
of life and limb alone is an adequate notion of &quot;happiness,&quot;
and right-to-life proponents forget that at their peril in the
present debate over illegitimacy.  By opposing the current system
of welfare benefits, we advocate a transformation of the political
and social culture that will sustain both &quot;happiness&quot;
and a more enduring pro-life consensus than even legal reform
can hope to accomplish.

<P>
<H2>RESPONSES TO LIBERAL SCARE TACTICS</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<LI>  The movement away from cash benefits affects only a small percentage
of the prospective caseload.  It is the least we can do and still
claim that we are changing the system.
<P>
<LI>  By targeting teenagers, we intend to stop the cycle of misery
before it starts.
<P>
<LI>  Liberal social groups base their projections about the number
of children who will be cut from the rolls on a flawed and biased
study by a liberal think-tank, which derived the figures by going
back in time 10 years and implementing the bill, then returning
to the present -- without assuming any change in behavior or population
size.   
<P>
<LI>  The elimination of benefits affects only potential future additions
to the welfare rolls.  Not one person currently receiving welfare
would lose any benefits the day after the bill is passed. Given the Faustian bargain we have made
with current recipients,
it would be unethical to require them to function normally at
this stage.  Instead, we must protect future generations from
becoming mired in the habits of dependency.
<P>
The under-18 provision applies only with respect to federal funding.
 States are free to use state funds as they see fit.
<P>
<LI>  Minor mothers retain Medicaid, food stamps, and housing benefits.
<P>
<LI>  The federal government spends welfare dollars very inefficiently.
 One study found that less than 35 cents out of every federal
welfare dollar was paid in cash directly to the needy.  If the
federal government gave all the money it spends on welfare directly
to the poor, each family of four would receive more than the average
American family income.
<P>
<LI>  By cashing out AFDC benefits, the federal government frees
new dollars which the states can then spend on services for young
unwed mothers -- more compassionate alternatives that will minister
personally to mothers and children, instead of sapping their spirits.
<P>
<LI>  Private charitable efforts rescue far more individuals than
government social programs. Historically, private-sector organizations have succeeded in
transforming
the poor by setting behavioral standards for the receipt of assistance.
 Because it is far easier to receive a check in the mail, no questions
asked, federal welfare has kept the needy from receiving real
help. 
<P>
<LI>  In 1991, private charities provided, in cash or in kind, over
$176 billion for health, education, and welfare.  More than $100
billion of that amount was in cash.  The same year, Americans
volunteered time and manpower the equivalent of nine million full-time
employees.  After declining steadily through the 1960s and 1970s,
charitable giving rose during the 1980s.
<P>
<LI>  It is wrong to defer welfare cuts until some direct replacement
is identified for every current recipient because bad charity
drives out good.

<TITLE>THE TRUTH ABOUT AFDC</TITLE>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<P>
<H2>THE TRUTH ABOUT AFDC</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
 <I>MYTH:  Single mothers heading households
alone are being unfairly singled out in the discussion of reforming
the Aid to Families With Dependent Children (AFDC) program.</I>
<P>
<B>FACT:</B>  According to the Census Bureau, the vast majority (87 percent)
of AFDC recipients live in single-parent households.  Nearly half
(47 percent) of the mothers on AFDC have never married; 23 percent
are widowed or divorced; and 17 percent are married, but living
without a husband present in the home.  Only 13 percent of women
receiving AFDC are married and living with a spouse. 
<P><BR>
<I>MYTH:  Women
receiving AFDC have the same childbearing patterns as non-AFDC
women.</I>
<P>
<B>FACT:</B>  Women on AFDC are significantly younger than other
first-time mothers when they bear their first child.  The average
age of new mothers in the AFDC population (age 20) is three years
younger than the average age of non-AFDC mothers at first birth.
 AFDC mothers also have a slightly higher average number of children
(2.6 children).
<P>
<BR>
<I>MYTH:  If AFDC mothers had guaranteed child care
and additional material resources, they could earn their college
degrees in a matter of years.</I>
<P>
<B> FACT:</B>  While 85 percent of non-AFDC
women are at least high school graduates, almost half (44 percent)
of AFDC mothers do not have a high school diploma.  Only 19 percent
of women receiving AFDC have completed at least one year of college.
<P>
<BR>
<I>MYTH: The majority of AFDC recipients are minorities.</I>
<P>
<B>FACT:</B>  There are far more white women in their childbearing years on AFDC (27.4
million) than African-American and Hispanic mothers combined (5.7
million and 4.2 million respectively).  Minority women, however,
do receive aid in numbers disproportionate to their population
size.  Only 7 percent of white mothers collect AFDC, while 26
percent of African-American mothers and 19 percent of Hispanic
mothers receive AFDC benefits.

<TITLE>QUOTABLE COMMENTS ON WELFARE REFORM AND
ILLEGITIMACY</TITLE>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<P>
<H2>QUOTABLE COMMENTS ON
<BR>WELFARE REFORM AND
<BR>ILLEGITIMACY</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
&quot;Welfare programs must contribute to the attack on family
breakdown and illegitimacy.  Unless such problems are dealt with
effectively, they fester, and grow, sapping the strength of society
as a whole and extending their consequences in troubled families
from one generation to the next.&quot;
<BR>
<I>- John F. Kennedy</I>
<P>
<BR>
&quot;Illegitimacy is the single most important social problem
of our time because it drives everything else.  The task is not
to devise a public relations campaign to discourage single teenage
girls from having babies, but to neutralize whatever is impeding
the age-old impulse of human beings to form families.&quot;
<BR>
<I>- Charles Murray</I>
<P>
<BR>
&quot;The real source of the problem is the inordinate number
of out-of-wedlock births in this country.  There's no question
that ending welfare for unwed mothers would work.  The question
is, 'Is it morally right?'&quot;
<BR>
<I>- Bill Clinton</I>
<P>
<BR>
&quot;I do believe that having children out of wedlock is wrong.&quot;
<BR>
<I>- Donna Shalala</I>
<P>
<BR>
&quot;Unmarried teen childbearing is morally wrong because of
its costs for children and society.  It is wrong -- not simply
foolish or impractical -- for women and men to make babies they
cannot support emotionally and financially.  We must reject moral
relativism and reassert our common values.  It is also time to
challenge the complacent view that having babies out of wedlock
is simply a lifestyle choice, and that since all lifestyles choices
are equally valid, no behavior should be condemned.  This stance
is untenable in the face of compelling evidence that not all choices
are equal in terms of their impact on children, and that children
need fathers as well as mothers.  Massive federal spending on
remedial programs will not solve the problem.  Families are the
primary socializers of children; families teach children how to
be citizens.  To deprive children of crucial adult models of citizenship,
anthropologist David Murray suggests, is to 'undercapitalize'
society's investment in its own future.  The social welfare system
has 'normalized' fatherless families.  The dilemma is this: Everything
the welfare system does to create normal and acceptable lives
for the children of teen mothers creates the perception that their
parents' behavior is normal and acceptable.  The system makes
government rather than parents ultimately responsible for the
lives of children.&quot;
<BR>
<I>- Progressive Policy Institute</I>

<P>
<BR>
&quot;The essential first step is to acknowledge that at root,
in almost every area of important public concern, we are seeking
to induce persons to act virtuously.  Not only is such conduct
desirable in its own right, it appears now to be necessary if
large improvements are to be made in those matters we consider
problems.  In Victorian England and Victorian America, countless
organizations tried to save the children and they succeeded. 
They did so on the basis of firm convictions as to what constitutes
a decent family life.  We have rejected implicitly if not explicitly
the moral convictions that underlay that effort, replacing child-saving
programs with something we now call condescendingly welfare. 
Replacing our desire to save children with the desire merely to
end poverty or dependency [sic].&quot;
<BR>
<I>- James Q. Wilson</I>
<P>
<BR>
&quot;After making the most arduous attempt to objectify the problem
of poverty, to divorce poverty from any moral assumptions and
conditions, we are learning how inseparable the moral and material
dimensions of that problem are.  And after trying to devise social
policies that are scrupulously neutral and 'value-free,' we are
finding these policies fraught with moral implications that have
grave material and social consequences.&quot;
<BR>
<I>- Gertrude Himmelfarb</I>
<P>
<BR>
&quot;We looked at a hundred different programs around the country
that were trying to deal with out-of-wedlock births, and not one
of them moved the needle.  There just weren't any results.&quot;
<BR>
<I>- anonymous Clinton aide</I>
<P>
<BR>
&quot;I know this must seem a strange message from a not particularly
religious writer in an utterly secular newspaper, but I am increasingly
struck by two phenomena.  The first is the growing sense that
America's major failings are not political or economic but moral.
 The second is the discovery that the most successful <I>social</I>
programs are those that are driven -- even if only tacitly --
by moral or religious values.&quot;
<BR>
<I>- William Raspberry</I>
<P>
<BR>
&quot;Washington's continued medicalization of teen pregnancy
ignores the lessons of the past 20 years and is doomed to fail.
 Dealing with teenage pregnancy requires a one-on-one discussion
of values and morality.  What many call sexual liberation has
brought with it unhappy consequences for millions of teens.  This
is not liberation.  It is bondage for the child-mother and the
mother's child.&quot;
<BR>
<I>- Joseph Califano</I>
<P>
<BR>
&quot;The project of self-government depends on the capacity of
citizens to govern their own passions, urges, habits, and expectations.
 If they cannot govern their own lives individually, how can they
be successful in self-government as a republic?&quot;
<BR>

<html><title>Cong. Kingston on Welfare Reform</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
Note: This document is the unofficial version of the Congressional Record.
      The printed Congressional Record produced by the Government Printing
      Office is the only official version.
<center>
      CONGRESSIONAL RECORD (HOUSE)<br>
     September 19, 1995<p>
                                                              PAGE H9223
       <p>IMPORTANCE OF A BALANCED BUDGET, WELFARE REFORM AND MEDICARE TO
                                        AMERICA
        <p></center>The SPEAKER pro tempore.  Under a previous order of the House,
          the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Kingston) is recognized for 5
          minutes.
            Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, I have just returned from 4 days in
          Georgia visiting with constituents, meeting with a few civic clubs,
          and riding in a parade or two.  In talking around the district that
          I represent, the coastal area of Georgia, Georgia`s first district,
          the three predominant things that seem to be on people`s minds are
          balancing the budget, reforming welfare, and the changes in the
          Medicare Program.
            On balancing the budget, even though the other body across the
          Hall failed to pass the balanced budget amendment, it is absolutely
          undeniable that the American people want us to balance the budget.
          As a member of the Committee on Appropriations I can say that we
          are moving in that direction.  We have 1 appropriations bill left
          out of 13. Hopefully, we will pass that this week or next week.
          When we do, we will have all of our appropriations bills passed,
          which take us to having a balanced budget by the year 2002.
    <p><center> PAGE H9223</center><p>
            The importance of this, Mr. Speaker, is that as we have these
          billion dollar deficits each year, it takes money away from other
          programs and we are unable to pay down the debt.  Now all we are
          doing is servicing the interest.  Currently, the interest on the
          national debt is the third largest item in our budget every year.
          In 2 years that interest is expected to exceed all of the military
          spending.  Once we get rid of the deficit, we can start paying off
          the principal beyond the interest of the debt.  Of course, it will
          take many, many years.  We have a $4.8 trillion debt.
            The definition, Mr. Speaker, of a trillion, to illustrate it,
          and, first of all, it is almost beyond comprehension, but if we
          spent $100,000 a minute, 24 hours a day, it would take 19 years to
          get to $1 trillion.  We currently have a debt of $4.8 trillion.  We
          simply cannot pass that on to the children of the United States of
          America.
            I think it is very important that this House is moving toward a
          balanced budget as fast as we can.  I certainly hope the folks in
          the other body feel the same way.
     <center><p>PAGE H9223 <p></center>
            We have passed welfare reform in the House. Our welfare reform
          has four significant planks to it.
            No. 1, a work requirement.  If an individual is able-bodied, in
          order to get welfare, they should have to work.
            No. 2, a mechanism to discourage illegitimate births, since that
          is one of the biggest problems in America today.
     <center><p>    PAGE H9223<p></center>
            No. 3, State flexibility.  We may do it differently in Georgia
          than the folks in New York, but let us make those decisions.
            And No. 4, no welfare benefits to illegal aliens.  We want to
          help them if they are hurt in this country, but we also want them
          to get back home if they are not American citizens, so that they
          are not coming over to America to enjoy the benefits of our
          generous public benefits system.
            The third thing people are interested in, of course, is the
          Medicare Program. The current trustees in April said that Medicare
          is going broke.  We have to move to save it.  We are trying to slow
          the growth of it, trying to make the growth of Medicare inflation
          about 6 percent, which is closer to what it is in regular medical
          inflation.  Actually, regular medical inflation was down last
          year.  It was not even inflation.  But the costs were down.
    <p><center>PAGE H9223</center><p>
            The thing we need to do on Medicare is protect and preserve it by
          simplifying it.  We want to give senior citizens a whole list of
          options: choice of doctors, choice of traditional fee-for-service
          plans, choice of traditional Medicare, and, along with that, some
          other options like Medisave accounts and so forth.
            We believe all this can be done, Mr. Speaker, and the result will
          be a better product to American seniors.  Again, we want to protect
          and preserve it.
            The big frustration that the American people seem to be having is
          while we have done a lot of things in the House, across the Hall,
          in the other body, they are taking the route of inaction.  It is
          true today they passed welfare reform, but we passed ours back in
          March. It is time to bring these issues to a question.  Will the
          other body and will the executive branch join the House, the lower
          Chamber, in making the reforms necessary to preserve our country?
  <p><center>PAGE H9223<p></center>
            I hope that they will, because we are clearly on the road to
          personal responsibility, personal discipline, balancing the budget,
          lowering taxes, decreasing Government regulation and
          micromanagement out of Washington, and, best of all and most
          importantly, increasing personal freedom.  We cannot do it alone.
          We have to have the cooperation of the full legislative branch of
          Government, which means the other body, and we have to have the
          executive branch to sign this into law.
            Mr. Speaker, if we can get the cooperation of the folks across
          the hall, I believe we will have a balanced budget, we will have
          Medicare reform, and we will have welfare reform.  This, Mr.
          Speaker, I believe, is what the American people are asking for.

<title>Job Prospects for College Graduates</title>

<h3>Job Prospects for College Graduates:  What's the Problem?</h3><br>
<h4>by Kate Obenshain Griffin<br>
Director of Program Development<br>
<a href="/yaf">Young America's Foundation</a><br>
September 7, 1995</h4><br>
</center>

	Students arriving at the "Ivies" this fall are encountering a surprising phenomenon.  Women's studies courses outnumber economics classes, often by as much as two to one.  Princeton remains the lone exception, but not by much:  25 women's studies courses compared with 32 in economics.<p>
	This phenomenon has something to do with the fact that over 50 percent of those who graduated from college in May still cannot find jobs appropriate for their degrees.  But that's only half the picture;  the following anecdote completes it.  <p>
	<i>New Republic</i> editor and outspoken liberal Michael Kinsley wrote this of his attempt to hire a recent college graduate as his research assistant:  "[T]he government makes it comically difficult for the honest citizen to hire a single employee."  Comical to some, but not to the new graduate.  Kinsley said government regulation "plunges you into an entirely new dimension of complexity as an employer" with "a minimum of 37 different forms and 50 separate checks to hire a single employee for a year."  As a result of government regulation, Kinsley's young assistant ended up right back where he found her:  in the unemployment line.<p>
	Two simple reasons explain why half of today's college graduates cannot find jobs befitting their degree.  First, colleges are not preparing students adequately and employers know it.  They are focusing on fads such as women's studies rather than spending limited resources on core academic subjects.  And second, burgeoning government regulation is having a pernicious, and often underestimated, impact on the job market. <p>
	Thanks to a dramatic shift in the direction of college curricula, a degree no longer indicates proficiency in the basic skills.  The <i>New York Times</i> reported that employers, "express a lack of confidence in the ability of schools and colleges to prepare young people for the workplace."  According to a major report by the National Center on the Educational Quality of the Workforce, employers, well aware of grade inflation, "pay little attention to measurements of school performance."  Nevzer Stacey of the Department of Education went one step further:  "Employers have given up on the schools."<p>
	What are our colleges and universities doing wrong?  While skill requirements for employment are increasing (57 percent of employers say skill requirements have increased), the quality and substance of our educational institutions are eroding.  Except at a few select schools which have maintained their commitment to quality academic instruction, multicultural and politically correct courses supplant classes that have practical value for future employment.  <p>
	What courses are now preparing our students for the work force?  At Columbia University this fall: <i> Race, Gender, and the Politics of Rock 'n' Roll</i> and <i>The Invisible Women in Literature</i>:<i> The Lesbian Literary Tradition</i>.   At Penn:  <i>Search for Extraterrestrial Life</i> and <i>(Im)possible Animals</i>.  At Brown:  <i>Unnatural Acts and Split Britches</i>, <i>Circumcision: Male and Female, Jewish and Gentile and Daughters of Darkness: Lesbian Tropes</i>.  And Harvard, not to give students the idea that the free market might is a good thing, offers <i>Alternative Economies:</i>  <i>The Case Against Capitalism</i>, <i>1648-1848</i> in addition to activist-oriented <i>Status of Environmental Justice as a Public Policy Issue</i> and<i> AIDS, Health, and Human Rights</i>.  Other courses influencing students' outlook on the free market include Cornell's <i>The Selfish Individual and the Modern World</i>, Princeton's <i>Income Distribution</i>, and Yale's<i> Gender and the Politics of Resistance:  Feminism, Capitalism and the Third World.</i> <p>
	According to a recent survey in <i>The Chronicle of Higher Education</i>, finding a good job is the number one reason students attend college.  Yet schools are so caught up in hot political issues that they have lost sight of a critical aspect of their mission:  training students for the workforce.  As Wendy Bounds of the<i> Wall Street Journal</i> said, "After an outlay of thousands of dollars, college graduates discover that a bachelor's degree doesn't buy what it did 10 years ago."<p>
	Hand in hand with higher education's own responsibility for the attrition of opportunities for college graduates is another culprit:  government regulation.  While Clinton panders to the twenty-something crowd with his expensive AmeriCorps and student loan programs, his administration's regulatory policies are having a baleful effect.  Businesses are forced to spend vast resources on compliance with regulations rather than on expansion and hiring.  Take the paper industry for example.  Over the past four years, one of the largest book paper suppliers in North America, P.H. Glatfelter, spent <i>$180 million</i> to satisfy regulatory requirements.  That is $180 million that will not be spent developing the business or hiring new workers. <p>   
	The numbers are staggering.  There are four times more federal regulations today than in 1965 and 14 times more than in 1950, totaling over 200 volumes and 132,000 pages.  Estimates show regulations costing the U.S. economy over $500 billion annually.  Employment quotas, for instance, set businesses back between $5 and $8 billion annually on direct compliance (government paperwork, mandated advertising in minority newspapers, etc.).  Many billions more, however, are lost in indirect costs due to the diversion of management time, resources, and energy.  And according to author Thomas Sowell, minorities have not benefited from this loss.  He says the relative economic position of minorities has actually fallen since the United States implemented employment quotas.  <p>
	As a result of new and existing regulations, the jobs students have counted on are just not there.  Rather than pay the price of expansion, businesses are either stagnant or cutting back.  During July and August 1995, manufacturing jobs declined by an average of 38,000 per month.  Yet in August alone, government <i>increased</i> its payroll by 73,000 jobs.  That is 73,000 new bureaucrats to write, revise and enforce regulations which are largely responsible for factories losing 120,000 jobs overall in 1995. <p>
	While universities educate students in <i>The Drama of Homosexuality </i>(Harvard) and <i>Spirit Possession</i>, <i>Shamanism</i>, <i>Curing and Witchcraft</i> (Cornell), the Clinton administration is doing little to plan for the employment needs of future graduates.   For instance, there are <i>one million </i>cosmetology grads who cannot find jobs in their field.  Yet this year, there will be <i>200,000</i> new cosmetology students, many of whom will seek and receive assistance from federal loan programs.  While the Clinton administration demands increases in student loan program funding, those funds are not granted to students according to any reasonable estimate of what the market can sustain.  Rather, this administration is more concerned about building demand for federal student loan programs than in planning for employment needs.  Consequently, higher education continues to send graduates into ridiculously glutted markets, or no markets at all. <p> 
	Is it any wonder that over 50 percent of May's graduates are still looking for the jobs they hoped their degrees would lead them to?  If we continue to ignore the obvious impact of an increasingly politically correct curriculum, staggering new and existing regulations, and poor investment planning with taxpayer dollars on the part of the Clinton administration, recent college graduates, once our brightest hope for the future, will be increasingly unwanted in the workforce.<p>

<CENTER><H3>Winning the Next Education Battle</H3><p>

<hr>
<br>
  Education will surely be an important issue in the 1996 presidential election.  President Clinton
regularly uses the issue as a weapon against Republican budget austerity and fiscal conservatism,
as was the case when a smaller than anticipated increase in federal funding for school lunches
(but an increase none the less) became a "cut" in the program and thus an attack on the whole
education system.<P>
    The next battle is likely to be over the financial aid program for college students--specifically the
Clinton administration's plan to provide direct government funded student loans.  Congress in
1993 approved a phase-in of the program over at least five years.  The Administration hopes to
accelerate the program to reach 100% participation in 1997-8.  Rep. William Goodling (R-PA),
Chairman of the Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee, and Nancy Kassebaum
(R-Kan), Chairman of Labor and Human Resources Committee, have separately introduced
legislation (HR 530 and S 495) to cap the growth of the direct loan program at the 40% level.  In
light of recent cost estimates for the program, some are now calling for a complete repeal of the
program.<P>

    This time around conservatives are on solid ground.  The prudent and fiscally responsible
position is to eliminate the program before it costs American taxpayers -- not to mention
American college students -- more than they can afford.  Besides, getting rid of this program is
pro-education.  Here are four reason why.<P>
<ol>
<li> <STRONG>The Direct Loan Program does not save money</STRONG>.  By streamlining and centralizing the
whole student loan program, direct lending is supposed to save taxpayers billions of dollars. 
President Clinton's 1996 budget claims $5.2 billion in savings if the direct loan program is fully
implemented and replaces guaranteed loans.  A recent report by the Congressional Budget
Office, however, argues that the direct loan program, if fully implemented, would save only $115
million over the next seven years.  The difference is largely explained by changes in official
budget scoring to account for the complicated long-term administrative costs of direct loans.  (It
is also due to the removal from the cost estimate of savings that are not due to the direct loan
program.)  Indeed, according to the updated CBO report, eliminating the direct loan program and
maintaining the guaranteed program would save $1.5 billion over the next seven years.  <P>
<li> <STRONG>The Direct Loan Program adds considerably to the national debt</STRONG>.  As it currently stands
private lenders provide the capital for the loans, private and state guarantor agencies process the
loans and the federal government subsidizes the loan interest rate, guarantees the loans in cases
of default and exercises regulatory authority over the whole program. That is to say, the vast bulk
of capital is provided by private sources.  Under the Clinton plan the federal government would
borrow the money necessary to provide capitol for the loans and would service and collect the
loans itself.  This would require the federal government to borrow an additional $20-25 billion a
year to provide capital for the program.  According the Rep. Ernest Istook (R-OK) in testimony
last spring, a complete shift to direct loans could add $348 billion to the national debt by the year
2014.  And this does not consider any additional borrowing costs this expansion of debt will have
on the existing debt!<P>
<li><STRONG>The Direct Loan Program creates a new government bureaucracy</STRONG>.  Direct lending
centralizes control in the Department of Education and creates the potential for vast inefficiencies
and unconstrained costs.  The Department is hiring 600 new employees to administer the
program and anticipates 20,000 contract employees by the time the program is fully operational. 
The government is already funding the expansion with an unencumbered $2.5 billion
authorization.  This in a government department that is notoriously disorganized and
mismanaged.  In 1994, for instance, the Department of Education gave out $700 million in direct
loans but is unable to account for some $100 million.  The Advisory Committee on Student
Financial Assistance recently reported that the direct loan program is "potentially exposed to
multiple loans, overawards, loans to ineligible students, and excessive cash drawdowns" and, in
general, cannot "ensure program integrity."  This is the program that wants to take over
responsibility for making six million loans and dispersing over $20 billion a year?<P>
<li> <STRONG>The Direct Loan Program is bad for students and education</STRONG>.  Direct lending radically
changes the federal government's involvement in college lending programs by nationalizing what
for three decades has been a private-public partnership.  There are currently efforts to nationalize
(though not directly within the government) the college accreditation process, which allows a
college's students to be eligible for financial aid.  One can only imagine the temptations
presented to education reformers if the power of accreditation is combined with government
control over student loan money.  If recent history is any guide--witness Goals 2000 and the
drive for multicultural curriculum changes--further government intrusion in the academy will
only hinder and not help college and university education.  <P>
</ol>

    At a time when many existing programs are being reconsidered in light of the need to balance the
federal budget, Congress should think very carefully before completely federalizing the multi-billion dollar student loan program.  In the early 1970s Congress experimented with a direct loan
program called the Federally Insured Student Loan (FISL) program.  It was poorly managed and,
because the government was ineffective at collecting the loans, default rates increased above
previous levels.  Not surprisingly it was phased out in 1976.  It was largely because of this failure
that there emerged the current decentralized system that relies on private lenders and guarantors. 
Taxpayers should not be expected to tolerate more bureaucracy and an increased federal debt in
order to support another inefficient and costly program that does not help students or their
families.<P>  
    Let's eliminate the direct loan program and focus our energy on reforming the existing system
rather than replacing it with a new government-run program.  <P>

<P>
THE development officer of a reputable Western university recently
took one of the school's deans to meet a wealthy alumnus. In the
alum's office, the dean spied a bumper sticker that read: ``Socialists
reject history. Fair enough: History rejects Socialism.'' Upon
leaving, the dean condescendingly remarked that the sticker was
annoying, to which the development officer replied: ``You have
to learn how to talk to these people. This is the future.''
<P>
``These
people'' are concerned university alumni, and they represent the
best hope for influencing colleges and universities back toward
sanity. At schools such as Dartmouth, Princeton, Stanford, Wellesley,
Duke, Mount Holyoke, and Yale, alumni groups are demanding the
de-politicization of higher learning and better stewardship of
donations. According to the<I> Wellesley News</I>, in 1994 fewer than
50 per cent of alumnae contributed to Wellesley, for the first
time since 1978. Wellesley's alumnae-association director attributes
the decrease in part to a demand for accountability. A group of
Dartmouth alumni sued the Board of Trustees after rule changes
severely limited alumni involvement in decision-making. At South
Carolina's Converse College, trustees and alumni forced the president's
resignation after a string of multicultural excesses.
<P>
Until very
recently, the well-documented politicization of colleges and universities
went unchecked by alumni. The somnambulance of this core group
of university benefactors has allowed college administrators to
accede to the political demands of the academic Left without cost.
This inattentiveness, however, is ending at a propitious historical
moment, a time when universities are facing great financial pressure
from reduced government subsidies, resistance to skyrocketing
tuition hikes, and the hangover from years of improvident spending.
Universities depend to a significant extent on private giving.
According to <I>The Chronicle of Higher Education</I>, university trustees,
alumni, and private donors provide 49 per cent of the total revenue
of American colleges and universities, or nearly $3.4 billion
in 1994. With the increasing importance of the marginal dollar
should come an opportunity for those seeking authentic university
reform. 
<P>
While alumni slept, radicals who entered the academic world
in the Sixties slowly achieved positions of power in faculties
and administrations. Along with younger disciples, they redesigned
traditional curricula, revamped reading lists and course requirements,
instituted speech codes, redefined acceptable behavior outside
the classroom, and generally subverted the traditional mission
of the university. The end of higher learning was no longer to
be the cultivation of the mind but rather, as Richard Weaver observed,
``the conditioning [of] the young for political purposes.''
<P>
This
revolution within the university marched on virtually unnoticed
by alumni principally because the college public-relations apparatus
held a monopoly on the flow of information. Even when the national
press picked up on political correctness (years after the fact),
alums were lulled by reassurances that at their alma mater ``nothing
had changed.''
<P>
But the university stranglehold on information began
to loosen when in the early 1980s entrepreneurial students, aided
by the introduction of desktop-publishing technology and educational
institutes willing to contribute money and expertise, established
alternative student newspapers at a number of campuses. Coordinated
nationally by the Collegiate Network, these papers gave 75 to
100 schools voices independent of university control. To serve
the 2,000 campuses that had no such publication, the Intercollegiate
Studies Institute (ISI) launched in 1990 a nationwide alternative
student newspaper, CAMPUS:<I> America's Student Newspaper</I>, and began
informational mailings to tens of thousands of targeted alumni
donors. As these efforts took hold, alumni started to realize
that their alma maters were becoming radicalized laboratories
for multicultural experimentation.
<P>
The potential for exercising
real clout was most recently evidenced by an expose in an ISI-published
student journal at Yale, <I>Light and Truth</I>, which broke the story
of Yale's refusal to administer as promised $20 million given
by alumnus Lee Bass to establish an integrated program in Western
civilization. When it became evident to Mr. Bass that he had been
kept in the dark while the Yale administration explored ways to
divert the money from the agreed-upon program, he asked that Yale
refund the $20 million, plus interest. Yale was forced to comply,
to the accompaniment of nationwide headlines and the reaction
of a donor community infuriated by the sorry treatment of Mr.
Bass.
<P>
According to reports in both the New York Times and the Boston
Globe, much of the opposition to the Bass-funded Western-civilization
program was ideological. The Globe reported that ``Some Yale faculty
have resisted the emphasis on Western Civilization, favoring a
more multicultural curriculum.'' The Times stated that ``Liberals
had criticized the restrictions placed on the donation, arguing
that the money could be better spent on courses with a multicultural
perspective.'' John Leo noted in <I>U.S. News &amp; World Report</I>
that the Bass affair is ``a reminder of how far the modern university
. . . will go these days to avoid hurting the feelings of the
campus Left.'' Meanwhile, Yale's donor community was kept minutely
informed by successive mailings of <I>Light and Truth</I> and other updates.
<P>
Such
shoddy treatment of one of their most prominent confreres led
many Yale alumni to ask, in effect, ``If Yale values a left-leaning
political agenda over $20 million, how will it treat my $1,000,
$10,000, or $100,000 gift?''
<P>
After subscribing to <I>Light and Truth</I>,
reform-minded alumni like Yale's Robert T. Eskridge are considering
novel ways to redirect their philanthropy. Mr. Eskridge wrote:
``We have been shocked when reading the <I>Light and Truth</I> publication,
and having recently arranged in our wills to leave most of our
estates to Yale and my wife's college, Beaver College, we feel
now that we would prefer to support an effort . . . to return
the education of future generations to its traditional moorings.''
Yale is out of the will, and the Eskridges have established a
trust to promote genuine higher learning.
<P>
The cost of Yale's behavior
is now estimated to be several times the original Bass gift of
$20 million. The principled stand of Lee Bass encouraged many
others to join a nationwide alumni movement committed to using
its financial muscle to restore the traditional foundations of
higher education. Already, alumni have organized for collective
action at Stanford (Winds of Freedom), Dartmouth (The Ernest Martin
Hopkins Institute), Yale (<I>Light and Truth</I>), Wellesley (Women for
Freedom), and Princeton (Princeton Alumni Viewpoints).
<P>
In countering
the agenda of the academic Left, these and other alumni efforts
will doubtless be accused of having a conservative agenda of their
own. If the impulse toward reform is indeed conservative, it is
the noble impulse to conserve the proper ends of an authentically
humane education.
<P>
From the earliest beginnings of Western culture,
the ends of education were those of Plato's Academy: wisdom and
virtue. If these ancient ends are to be rescued from the will
to power of campus politicians, all of us -- students, faculty,
trustees, donors, and alumni -- need to act with a sense of urgency.
As William F. Buckley Jr. stated in his landmark book God and
Man at Yale, ``If the present generation does not check the university's
ideological drive, the next generation most probably will not
want to.''

<title>Heritage Exclusive -- Fall Agenda of 104th Congress</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center><h3><i>Heritage Exclusive</i> -- The Fall Agenda of the 104th Congress -- House of Representatives</h3>
By <a href="mailto:griffinc@heritage.org">Charles P. Griffin</a><br>
Congressional Relations<br> <a href="/heritage/welcome.html">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
September 5, 1995<br></center>
<p>
The House of Representatives returns to Washington on Wednesday, September 6 to face two grueling months of budget debate.  The public attention has been focused on Medicare, but there are also 13 appropriations bills, reconciliation, and the debt ceiling that all must be dealt with during this time period.  It is not at all certain how the debate will turn out, but it is safe to assume that everyone will be happy to put these months behind them.
<p>
<b>Medicare:</b>
<p>
The trustees of the Medicare Trust Fund -- including three members of President Clinton's Cabinet -- have predicted the imminent bankruptcy of this health care safety net for the elderly.  Despite this, many politicians and special interest groups have been fighting the efforts to keep Medicare solvent.  Among the <a href="/heritage/library/categories/govern/gip4.html">special interests</a> that have fought reform are several that feed at the public trough.  The House will have to cut through the scare tactics, roll up their sleeves, and find real solutions to the Medicare crisis.  The Heritage Foundation has contributed <a href="/heritage/library/index/i2.html">several useful studies</a> for Congress to consider in the debate.
<p>
<b>The Federal Budget:</b>
<p>
There is much speculation in Washington as to what will occur with the 13 spending bills that Congress must pass -- in theory -- before the start of the new fiscal year on October 1.  The President has issued several veto threats for some of the appropriations bills, and it is anticipated that there will be significant disagreements between the Congress and the President over what the nation's <a href="/heritage/library/index/a2.html">spending priorities</a> should be.  If a new law funding a particular agency is not in place by October 1, Congress must either pass a "continuing resolution" to permit it to remain open, or all but essential activities must be closed down.  It is likely that the Congress will send 13 bills to the President by the deadline, but delays in the bill becoming law may occur due to the give-and-take between the two branches of government.
<p>
<b>Reconciliation:</b>
<p>
"Reconciliation," although it is a fancy word, essentially describes the process by which Congress etches all aspects of the budget -- including taxes, appropriations, and entitlements -- in concrete.  It is through this process that the Congress hopes to reduce the tax burden on Americans, control entitlement spending, and enact a budget that will achieve balance by 2002.  The reconciliation process likely will not be completed until sometime in mid-October.
<p>
<b>Debt Ceiling:</b>
<p>
Since the federal government has repeatedly run up large deficits over the past 30 years, the Treasury Department must borrow money -- through bonds -- to finance the government's activities.  The government is limited by law as to how much money can be borrowed at any time.  A good way to think of this is like the credit limit on your credit cards.  This credit limit will be reached by the Treasury Department in October or November, so a new law must be enacted to permit further borrowing.  The key question in this debate will be how much to raise the limit by.  In the past, Congress has passed both long-term and short-term increases.  A number of freshman representatives have been quoted publicly as opposing any increase in the debt and this could be a significant factor in the debate.

<title>Heritage Exclusive -- Fall Agenda of the 104th Congress</title>

<center><h3><i>Heritage Exclusive</i> -- The Fall Agenda of the 104th Congress -- Senate</h3>
By <a href="mailto:rennej@heritage.org">Jim Renne</a><br>
Congressional Relations<br> <a href="/heritage/welcome.html">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
September 5, 1995<br>
</center>
<p>
	Hello everyone!  Welcome to the Heritage Foundation on Town Hall.  This is a first for me.  I've never "surfed the Net" before, let alone go on-line with a U.S. Senate update.  But, there's a first for everything including my Internet Inaugural Exclusive.
<P>
	The last few months of this year's Congressional session will be one of the busiest times in Congressional history.  Not only will a balanced budget be passed for the first time since Nixon's first term, but major reform legislation such as welfare and Medicare will be stacked end to end waiting for consideration on the ever-deliberative Senate floor.
<P>
	As you may be aware, the Senate, unlike the House of Representatives, has a general rule: If a Senator wants to "debate" an issue, he can debate until the cows come home.  There is no limit on the amount of time a Member of the Senate can talk once he's been recognized, except maybe the call of nature.  This can result in delays of days, weeks, even years.  This is known as a filibuster.
<P>
	I don't know how familiar you are with Parliamentary Procedure, so I thought I'd briefly explain key  parliamentary differences between the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate; and explain why it's more difficult for the Majority Party in the Senate to get things through.  
<P>
	One of the major differences is that in the House, rules governing time-limit and number of amendments on a particular bill are put up for a vote for each separate bill.  That means a simple majority of House Members can control and set limits to debate. This allows the Majority Party to dictate the timeframe and subject matter of any given issue allowing the Speaker of the House to ram through legislation.
<P>
	In the Senate, floor action is controlled by Unanimous Consent ("UC") -- meaning technically, one Senator can bring crucial legislation to a stand still at any time.  Sometimes even a threat of a filibuster is enough to kill a bill depending on whether the Majority leader can afford the time and effort required to beat one back. On the overwhelming majority of legislation, however, the majority and minority leaders agree on the terms of debate and pass a UC decree in which every Senator agrees on the terms.  
<P>
	But in the case where one Senator objects to the UC, a bill can be delayed indefinitely with a filibuster.  In this case, the only safeguard against a total shut down is a Cloture Petition.  Passing a Cloture Petition requires a vote of 3/5th of the Senate or 60 out of 100.  If Cloture is invoked, debate is automatically limited to 30 additional hours whereupon the bill will be immediately moved to a final vote. Thus, after Cloture has been invoked, a bill can pass with only 51 or a simple majority, where it took 60 to force the final vote.  Given the number of controversial bills coming before the Senate over these next few months, look for most if not all of the major issues to require 60 out of 100 votes instead of the usual simple majority of 51.  
<P>
	Having explained a little parliamentary procedure, I'll give a brief run down on what to expect in the Senate for the next few months.  
<P>
	The Senate reconvenes Tuesday, September 5, 1995, to begin the final lap of this marathon legislative session.  Look for the following issues to become prominent during the remainder of the session.<p>

<b>Welfare:</b><p>
The Senate has been the center of intrigue and Presidential politics over the last few months when it comes to welfare reform.  GOP Presidential candidates Bob Dole and Phil Gramm have been battling over whose welfare provisions will reign supreme.  Heritage's welfare expert <a href="/heritage/staff/rector.htm">Robert Rector</a> has written extensively on the subject and has been called upon to provide technical assistance to a powerful group of conservative Senators seeking to turn the tepid approach coming out of the Senate Finance Committee into bold, sweeping reform.  Heritage's <a href="/heritage/library/index/i5.html">reform proposals</a> will go a long way in addressing the critical ailments of the current system.  Already, the initial Senate version of the welfare reform bill has been strengthened by the inclusion of key Heritage proposals.  Some of Heritage's key provisions include measures to strengthen work requirements for recipients, reduce and discourage <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/cbrief18.html">illegitimacy</a>, and stop welfare abuse by illegal immigrants.  Look for a welfare reform showdown between Congress' real reforms and the Clinton Administration's status-quo approach.
<p>
<b>Medicare:</b>
<P>
Medicare reform legislation is another highly contentious issue making its way through the halls of Congress.  Again, Heritage Foundation proposals to save billions of tax-payer dollars while providing fair, more efficient medical service are at the center of the debate.  Domestic Policy Studies Director <a href="/heritage/staff/butler.htm">Dr. Stuart Butler</a> and Health Care Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/liu.htm">John Liu</a> have written several papers providing a <a href="/heritage/library/index/i2.html">blueprint</a> on how to save billions while giving recipients increased options and  more control over their benefits.  At the same time, these reforms will drastically reduce government bureaucracy.  The sweeping proposal is based on a novel idea: allowing beneficiaries to take advantage of the best health care system in the entire world -- the American private sector health industry.  Liberals are sure to shamelessly demagogue the issue, but a reform package will be passed.  The system is too close to bankruptcy to continue along its current path.
<p>
<b>Budget Reconciliation:</b>
<p>
By far the most tangible and contentious legislative confrontation to come will be the massive budget-balancing proposal known as the budget reconciliation process.  Budget reconciliation is an extremely complex process by which the House and Senate enact into law major budgetary reform legislation giving the U.S. Treasury authority to spend your tax money.  The usual formula by which Congress approves its yearly budgets includes two main components, Authorization and Appropriations.  Without both, taxpayer dollars cannot be spent.  However, when Congress finds itself deep in the red as it finds itself this year after forty years of liberal control, it must quickly and efficiently pass legislation to exact meaningful spending cuts.  The normal process is too convoluted to handle such sweeping change. Thus, Congress has created a hybrid process known as reconciliation as a way to exact savings out entitlement and other programs.  Since these programs are highly contentious and difficult for the authorizers to reconcile, Congress created a process by which the deficit hawks on the Budget Committee would provide authorizers with spending limits which can't be exceeded.  Then it's up to the numerous committees of jurisdiction to make the necessary changes to meet the numbers.  The reconciliation process also provides the added advantage of putting the budget balancing bill on a fast track for floor consideration.  This avoids potential filibuster delays and a host of other hurdles.  
<p>
This year's budget process is even more contentious than most.  Holdover liberals from the big-taxing, big-spending Congresses of old are teaming up with the decidedly leftist Clinton Administration in a bitter fight to preserve the gargantuan welfare state.  And, for the first time in decades, a newly elected conservative Congress will actually vote on a monumental bill which will wipe out the entire federal deficit by the year 2002.  Because such a goal is so novel in Congress -- an encouraging sign of the newly elected conservative majority's will to lead -- budget reconciliation is taking on a truly revolutionary aura.  Look for a major confrontation between Congress and the Clinton Administration and a temporary shut down of non-essential government services during October, maybe even lasting into November.  Also, expect to see the welfare and Medicare bills pushed into the Reconciliation process because of gridlock in the normal authorization process.
<P>
<b>Debt Limit:</b>
<P>
Probably the most crucial issue to come before the Congress prior to the end of this session will be the annual debt ceiling bill.  For decades, the liberals in Congress nonchalantly raised the credit limit on America's national credit card by billions of dollars without as much as a blink of an eye.  The debt limit is the ultimate hammer on deficit spending.  If it is not raised, all government spending is immediately halted.  This would be a calamity beyond compare for both Congress and the President.  Thus, the new conservative leadership plans to attach sweeping spending cuts to this bill in order to force the big spending Clinton Administration to change its ways and make real cuts.  Look for the White House to seek a compromise early by accepting many of the spending cuts (and trying to take credit for them, too) in exchange for a debt limit increase.
<P>
I hope this information is interesting and informative to you all.  Please <a href="mailto:rennej@heritage.org">contact me</a> if you have any questions or comments.  Enjoy the rest of this Congressional Session!!

<center><h3>HOW OUR LAWS ARE MADE</h3></center><p>

I. <a name="introduction"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></a><p>

This handbook is intended to provide a readable and 
nontechnical outline of the background and the numerous steps 
of our Federal lawmaking process from the origin of an idea 
for a legislative proposal through its publication as a 
statute. This is a matter about which every citizen should be 
well informed so as to be able to understand the everyday 
news reports and discussions concerning the work of Congress.<p>

 It is hoped that this handbook will enable every citizen to 
gain a greater understanding of the Federal legislative 
process and its role as one of the bulwarks of our 
representative system. One of the most practical safeguards 
of the American democratic way of life is this legislative 
process that, with its emphasis on the protection of the 
minority, gives ample opportunity to all sides to be heard 
and make their views known. The fact that a proposal cannot 
become a law without consideration and approval by both 
Houses of Congress is an outstanding virtue of our 
legislative system. Open and full discussion provided for 
under our Con stitution frequently results in the notable 
improvement of a bill by amendment before it becomes law, or 
the defeat of a bad  proposal.<p>

 Because the large majority of laws originate in the House of 
Representatives, this discussion will be directed principally 
to the procedure in that body.<p>

 
 II. <a name="congress"> <b>THE CONGRESS</b></a><p>

Article I, Section 1, of the United States Constitution, 
provides that--<p>

 All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a 
Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a 
Senate and House of Representatives.

 The Senate is composed of 100 Members--2 from each State, 
irrespective of population or area--elected by the people in 
conformity with the provisions of the 17th Amendment to the 
Constitution. That amendment changed the former 
Constitutional method under which Senators were chosen by the 
respective State legislatures. A Senator must be at least 30 
years of age, have been a citizen of the United States for 9 
years, and, when elected, be a resident of the State for 
which the Senator is chosen. The term of office is 6 years 
and one-third of the total membership of the Senate is 
elected every second year. The terms of both Senators from a 
particular State are so arranged that they do not terminate 
at the same time. Of the 2 Senators from a State serving at 
the same time the one who was elected first--or if both were 
elected at the same time, the one elected for a full term--is 
referred to as the "senior" Senator from that State. The 
other is referred to as the "junior" Senator. If a Senator 
dies or resigns during the term, the governor of the State 
must call a special election unless the State legislature has 
authorized the governor to appoint a successor until the next 
election, at which time a successor is elected for the 
balance of the term. Most of the State legislatures have 
granted their governors the power of appointment.<p>

Each Senator has one vote.<p>

 As constituted in 1989--the 101st Congress--the House of 
Representatives is composed of 435 Members elected every 2 
years from among the 50 States, apportioned to their total 
populations. The permanent number of 435 was established 
following the Thirteenth Decennial Census in 1910, as 
directed in Article I, Section 2, of the Constitution, and 
was increased temporarily to 437 for the 87th Congress, to 
provide for one Representative each for Alaska and Hawaii. It 
seems undesirable to make a considerable increase in the 
number of Members, because a larger body, similar to the 
British House of Commons, consisting of 650 members, would be 
too unwieldy. The Constitution limits the number of 
Representatives to not more than one for every 30,000 of 
population, and, under a former apportionment in one State a 
particular Representative represented more than 900,000 
constituents, while another in the same State was elected 
from a district having a population of only 175,000. The 
Supreme Court * has since held unconstitutional a Missouri 
statute permitting a maximum population variance of 3.1 
percent from mathematical equality. The Court said that the 
variances among the districts were not unavoidable and, 
therefore, were invalid. This is an interpretation of the 
Court's earlier decision that "as nearly as is practicable 
one man's vote in a Congressional election is to be worth as 
much as another's".<p>

 * Kirkpatrick v. Preisler, 394 U.S. 526 (1969).<p>

 A law enacted in 1967 abolished all "at-large" elections 
(that is, Representatives elected by the voters of the entire 
State rather than in a Congressional district within the 
State) except, of course, in States entitled to only one 
Representative.<p>

 A Representative must be at least 25 years of age, have been 
a citizen of the United States for 7 years, and, when 
elected, be a resident of the State in which the 
Representative is chosen. If a Representative dies or resigns 
during the term, the governor of the State must call a 
special election for the choosing of a successor to serve for 
the unexpired portion of the term.<p>

Each Representative has one vote.<p>

In addition to the Representatives from each of the States, 
there is a Resident Commissioner from the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico and Delegates from the District of Columbia, 
American Samoa, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. The Resident 
Commissioner and the Delegates have most of the prerogatives 
of Representatives, with the important exception of the right 
to vote on matters before the House.<p>

Under the provisions of Section 2 of the 20th Amendment to 
the Constitution, Congress must assemble at least once every 
year, at noon on the 3d day of January, unless by law they 
appoint a different day.<p>

 A Congress lasts for 2 years, commencing in January of the 
year following the biennial election of Members, and is 
divided into 2 sessions.<p>

 Unlike some other parliamentary bodies, both the Senate and 
the House of Representatives have equal legislative functions 
and powers (except that only the House of Representatives may 
initiate revenue bills), and the designation of one as the 
"upper" House and the other as the "lower" House is not 
appropriate.<p>

 The Constitution authorizes each House to determine the 
rules of its proceedings. Pursuant to that authority the 
House of Representatives adopts its rules on the opening day 
of each Congress. The Senate, which considers itself a 
continuing body, operates under standing rules that it amends 
from time to time.<p>

 The chief function of Congress is the making of laws. In 
addition, the Senate has the function of advising and 
consenting to treaties and to certain nominations by the 
President. In the matter of impeachments, the House of 
Representatives presents the charges--a function similar to 
that of a grand jury--and the Senate sits as a court to try 
the impeachment. Both Houses meet in joint session on the 6th 
day of January, following a presidential election, to count 
the electoral votes. If no candidate receives a majority of 
the total electoral votes, the House of Representatives 
chooses the President from among the 3 candidates having the 
largest number of votes, and the Senate chooses the Vice 
President from the 2 candidates having the largest number of 
votes for that office.<p>

 
 III. <a name="legislation"><b>SOURCES OF LEGISLATION</b></a><p>

 Sources of ideas for legislation are unlimited, and 
proposed drafts of bills originate in many diverse quarters. 
First of these is, of course, the idea and draft conceived by 
a Member. This may emanate from the election campaign during 
which the Member had promised to introduce legislation on a 
particular subject, if elected. The entire campaign may have 
been based upon one or more such proposals. Or, through 
experience after taking office the Member may have become 
aware of the need for amendment or repeal of existing laws or 
the enactment of a statute in an entirely new field.<p>

 In addition, the Member's constituents--either as 
individuals or by corporate activity such as citizen groups 
or associations, bar associations, labor unions, 
manufacturers' associations, and chambers of commerce--may 
avail themselves of the right to petition, which is 
guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution, and 
transmit their proposals to the Member. Many excellent laws 
have originated in this way inasmuch as some of those 
organizations, because of their vital concern with various 
areas of legislation, have considerable knowledge regarding 
the laws affecting their interests and have the services of 
expert legislative draftsmen at their disposal for this 
purpose. If favorably impressed by the idea, the Member may 
introduce the proposal in the form in which it has been 
submitted or may first redraft it. In all events, the Member 
may consult with the Legislative Counsel of the House or the 
Senate, as the case may be, to frame the ideas in suitable 
legislative language and form for introduction.<p>

 In modern times the "executive communication" has become a 
prolific source of legislative proposals. This is usually in 
the form of a letter from a member of the President's Cabinet 
or the head of an independent agency--or even from the 
President--transmitting a draft of a proposed bill to the 
Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of 
the Senate. Despite the system of separation of powers, 
Article II, Section 3, of the Constitution imposes an 
obligation on the President to report to Congress from time 
to time on the "State of the Union" and to recommend for 
consideration such measures as the President considers 
necessary and expedient. Many of these executive 
communications follow on the President's message to Congress 
on the State of the Union. The communication is then referred 
to the standing committee having jurisdiction of the subject 
matter embraced in the proposal because a bill may be 
introduced only by a Member of Congress. The Chairman of that 
committee usually introduces the bill promptly either in the 
form in which it was received or with changes the Chairman 
considers necessary or desirable. This practice prevails even 
when the majority of the House and the President are not of 
the same political party, although there is no constitutional 
or statutory requirement that a bill be introduced to 
effectuate the recommendations. Otherwise, the message may be 
considered by the committee or one of its subcommittees to 
determine whether a bill should be introduced. The most 
important of the regular executive communications is the 
annual message from the President transmitting the proposed 
budget to Congress. This, together with testimony by 
officials of the various branches of the Government before 
the Appropriations Committees of the House and Senate, is the 
basis of the several appropriation bills that are drafted by 
the Committee on Appropriations of the House.<p>

 Several of the executive departments and independent 
agencies have staffs of trained legislative counsels whose 
functions include the drafting of bills to be forwarded to 
Congress with a request for their enactment.<p>

 The drafting of statutes is an art that requires great 
skill, knowledge, and experience. In some instances a draft 
is the result of a study covering a period of a year or more 
by a commission or committee designated by the President or 
one of the Cabinet officers. The Administrative Procedure Act 
and the Uniform Code of Military Justice are only 2 of many 
examples of enactments resulting from such studies. In 
addition, Congressional committees sometimes draft bills 
after studies and hearings covering periods of a year or 
more. Bills to codify the laws relating to crimes and 
criminal procedure, the judiciary and judicial procedure, the 
armed forces, and other subjects, have each required several 
years of preparation.<p>

 
 IV. <a name="Action"><b> FORMS OF CONGRESSIONAL ACTION</b></a><p>

The work of Congress is initiated by the introduction of a 
proposal in one of 4 principal forms. These are: the bill, 
the joint resolution, the concurrent resolution, and the 
simple resolution. By far the most customary form used in 
both Houses is the bill. During the 100th Congress (1987 
-1988), there were introduced in both Houses, 8,515 bills and 
1,073 joint resolutions. Of this number 5,585 bills and 678 
joint resolutions originated in the House of Representatives.<p>

 For the sake of simplicity this discussion will be confined 
generally to the procedure on a House of Representatives 
bill, but a brief comment will be made about each of the 
forms.<p>

<b> BILLS</b><p>

 A bill is the form used for most legislation, whether 
permanent or temporary, general or special, public or 
private.<p>

 The form of a House bill is as follows:<p>
<center>
                    A BILL<br
<br>
<br
 For the establishment, etc. 
            [as the title may be].<p>
</center>
 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
the United States of America in Congress assembled, That, 
etc.<p>

 The enacting clause was prescribed by law in 1871 and is 
identical in all bills, whether they originate in the House 
of Representatives or in the Senate.<p>

 Bills may originate in either the House of Representatives 
or the Senate, with one notable exception provided for by the 
Constitution. Article I, Section 7, of the Constitution, 
provides that all bills for raising revenue shall originate 
in the House of Representatives but the Senate may propose or 
concur with amendments, as on other bills. General 
appropriation bills also originate in the House of 
Representatives.<p>

 There are 2 types of bills--public and private. A public 
bill is one that affects the public generally. A bill of a 
private character, that is, a bill that affects an individual 
rather than the population at large, is called a private 
bill. A private bill is used for relief in matters such as 
immigration and naturalization and claims by or against the 
United States.<p>

 Article I, Section 8, prescribes the matters concerning 
which Congress may legislate, while Section 9 of the same 
Article places certain limitations on Congressional action.<p>

 A bill originating in the House of Representatives is 
designated by the letters "H.R." followed by a number that it 
retains throughout all its parliamentary stages. The letters 
signify "House of Representatives" and not, as is sometimes 
supposed, "House resolution". A Senate bill is designated by 
the letter "S." followed by its number. The term "companion 
bill" is used to describe a bill introduced in one House of 
Congress that is similar or identical to a bill introduced in 
the other House of Congress. <p>

 A bill that has been agreed to in identical form by both 
bodies becomes the law of the land only after--<p>

 (1) Presidential approval; or<p>

 (2) failure by the President to return it with objections to 
the House in which it originated within 10 days while 
Congress is in session; or<p>

 (3) the overriding of a Presidential veto by a two-thirds 
vote in each House.<p>

 It does not become law without the President's signature if 
Congress by their adjournment prevent its return with 
objections. This is known as a "pocket veto".<p>

<b> JOINT RESOLUTIONS</b><p>

 Joint resolutions may originate either in the House of 
Representatives or in the Senate--not, as may be supposed, 
jointly in both Houses. There is little practical difference 
between a bill and a joint resolution and, although the 
latter are not as numerous as bills, the 2 forms are often 
used indiscriminately. Statutes that have been initiated as 
bills have later been amended by a joint resolution, and vice 
versa. Both are subject to the same procedure--with the 
exception of a joint resolution proposing an amendment to the 
Constitution. When a joint resolution amending the 
Constitution is approved by two-thirds of both Houses, it is 
sent directly to the Archivist of the United States for 
submission to the several States for ratification. It is not 
presented to the President for approval.<p>

 The form of a House joint resolution is as follows:<p>
<center>
                 JOINT RESOLUTION<br>
<br>
<br
Authorizing, etc. [as the title may be].<p>
</center>

   Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives
   of the United States of America in Congress assembled,
   That all, etc.<p>

 The resolving clause is identical in both House and Senate 
joint resolutions, having been prescribed by statute in 1871. 
It is frequently preceded by one or more "whereas" clauses 
indicating the necessity for or the desirability of the joint 
resolution.<p>

 The term "joint" does not signify simultaneous introduction 
and consideration in both Houses.<p>

 A joint resolution originating in the House of 
Representatives is designated "H.J. Res." followed by its 
individual number which it retains throughout all its 
parliamentary stages. One originating in the Senate is 
designated "S.J. Res." followed by its number.<p>

 Joint resolutions become law in the same manner as bills.<p>

<b> CONCURRENT RESOLUTIONS</b><p>

 Matters affecting the operations of both Houses are usually 
initiated by means of concurrent resolutions. In modern 
practice, these normally are not legislative in character but 
are used merely for expressing facts, principles, opinions, 
and purposes of the 2 Houses. They are not equivalent to a 
bill and their use is narrowly limited within these bounds.<p>

 The term "concurrent" does not signify simultaneous 
introduction and consideration in both Houses.<p>

 A concurrent resolution originating in the House of 
Representatives is designated "H. Con. Res." followed by its 
individual number, while a Senate concurrent resolution is 
designated "S. Con. Res." together with its number. On 
approval by both Houses, they are signed by the Clerk of the 
House and the Secretary of the Senate and transmitted to the 
Archivist of the United States for publication in a special 
part of the Statutes at Large volume covering that session of 
Congress. They are not presented to the President for action 
as in the cases of bills and joint resolutions unless they 
contain a proposition of legislation, and that, of course, is 
not within their scope in their modern form.<p>

<b> SIMPLE RESOLUTIONS</b><p>

 A matter concerning the operation of either House alone is 
initiated by a simple resolution. A resolution affecting the 
House of Representatives is designated "H. Res." followed by 
its number, while a Senate resolution is designated "S. Res." 
together with its number. They are considered only by the 
body in which they were introduced and on adoption are 
attested to by the Clerk of the House of Representatives or 
the Secretary of the Senate, as the case may be, and are 
published in the Congressional Record.<p>

 
 V. <a name="reference"><b>INTRODUCTION AND REFERENCE TO COMMITTEE</b></a><p>

  Any Member, the Resident Commissioner, and the Delegates in 
the House of Representatives may introduce a bill at any time 
while the House is actually sitting by simply placing it in 
the "hopper" provided for the purpose at the side of the 
Clerk's desk in the House Chamber. Permission is not required 
to introduce the measure or to make a statement at the time 
of introduction. Printed blank forms for use in typing the 
original bill are supplied through the Clerk's office. The 
name of the sponsor is endorsed on the bill. A public bill 
may be sponsored by an unlimited number of Members. On 
request, a Member may be added as a sponsor no later than the 
day the bill is reported to the House. (For a discussion of 
"Reported bills", see Part VII.) In addition, a Member listed 
as a sponsor (other than the first sponsor) may have the 
Member's name deleted as a sponsor no later than the day the 
bill is reported to the House. To forestall the possibility 
that a bill might be introduced in the House on behalf of a 
Member without that Member's prior approval, the sponsoring 
Member's signature must appear on the bill before it is 
accepted for introduction. When there are multiple sponsors 
of a bill, the signature must be that of the Member first 
named thereon. In the Senate, unlimited multiple sponsorship 
of a bill also is permitted. Occasionally, a Member may 
insert the words "by request" after the Member's name to 
indicate that the introduction of the measure is in 
compliance with the suggestion of some other person.<p>

 In the Senate, a Senator usually introduces a bill or 
resolution by presenting it to one of the clerks at the 
Presiding Officer's desk, without commenting on it from the 
floor of the Senate. However, a Senator may use a more formal 
procedure by rising and introducing the bill or resolution 
from the floor. A Senator usually makes a statement about the 
measure when introducing it on the floor. Frequently, 
Senators obtain consent to have the bill or resolution 
printed in the body of the Congressional Record, following 
their formal statement.<p>

 If any Senator objects to the introduction of a bill or 
resolution, the introduction of the bill or resolution is 
postponed until the next day. If there is no objection, the 
bill is read by title and referred to the appropriate 
committee.<p>

 In the House of Representatives it is no longer the custom 
to read bills--even by title--at the time of introduction. 
The title is entered in the Journal and printed in the 
Congressional Record, thus preserving the purpose of the old 
rule. The bill is assigned its legislative number by the 
Clerk and referred to the appropriate committees by the 
Speaker (the Member elected to be the Presiding Officer of 
the House) with the assistance of the Parliamentarian. These 
details appear in the daily issue of the Congressional 
Record. It is then sent to the Government Printing Office 
where it is printed in its introduced form, and printed 
copies are available shortly thereafter in the document rooms 
of both Houses. <p>

 One copy is sent to the office of the Chairman of the 
committee to which it has been referred, for action by that 
committee. The clerk of the committee enters it on the 
committee's Legislative Calendar.<p>

 Perhaps the most important phase of the Congressional 
process is the action by committees. That is where the most 
intensive consideration is given to the proposed measures and 
where the people are given their opportunity to be heard. 
Nevertheless, this phase where such a tremendous volume of 
hard work is done by the Members is sometimes overlooked by 
the public, particularly when complaining about delays in 
enacting laws. There are, at present, 22 standing committees 
in the House and 16 in the Senate, as well as several select 
committees. In addition, there are several standing joint 
committees of the 2 Houses.<p>

 Each committee has jurisdiction over certain subject matters 
of legislation and all measures affecting a particular area 
of the law are referred to that committee that has 
jurisdiction over it. For example, the Committee on the 
Judiciary has jurisdiction over measures relating to judicial 
proceedings (civil and criminal) generally, and 18 other 
categories, of which Constitutional amendments, immigration 
and naturalization, bankruptcy, revision and codification of 
statutes, civil liberties, antitrust, patents, copyrights and 
trademarks, are but a few. In all, the rules of the House and 
of the Senate each provide for approximately 200 different 
classifications of measures that are to be referred to 
committees.<p>

 Membership on the various committees is divided between the 
2 major political parties. The proportion of the Members of 
the minority party to the Members of the majority party is 
determined by the majority party, except that one-half of the 
Members on the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct are 
from the majority party and one-half from the minority party. 
The respective party caucuses nominate Members of the caucus 
to be elected to each standing committee at the beginning of 
each Congress. Membership on a standing committee during the 
course of a Congress is contingent on continuing membership 
in the caucus that nominated the Member for election to the 
committee. If the Member ceases to be a Member of the caucus, 
the Member automatically ceases to be a Member of the 
standing committee.<p>

 A Member may serve on more than one committee. However, the 
rules of the caucus of the majority party in the House 
provide that the Chairmen of certain committees may not serve 
on another committee and that a Member may be Chairman of 
only one subcommittee of a committee or select committee with 
legislative jurisdiction, excepting certain committees 
performing housekeeping functions and joint committees.<p>

 A Member usually seeks election to the committee that has 
jurisdiction over a field in which the Member is most 
qualified and interested. For example, the Committee on the 
Judiciary traditionally is composed entirely of lawyers. Many 
Members are nationally recognized experts in the specialty of 
their particular committee or subcommittee.<p>

 Members rank in seniority in accordance with the order of 
their appointment to the committee, and usually the ranking 
majority Member is elected Chairman. The rules of the House 
require that committee Chairmen be elected from nominations 
submitted by the majority party caucus at the commencement of 
each Congress.<p>

 Most committees have 2 or more subcommittees that, in 
addition to having general jurisdiction, specialize in the 
consideration of particular classifications of bills. Each 
standing committee of the House, except the Committee on the 
Budget, that has more than 20 Members must establish at least 
4 subcommittees.<p>

 Each committee is provided with a professional and clerical 
staff to assist it in the innumerable administrative details 
and other problems involved in the consideration of bills. 
For the standing committees, the professional staff 
(consisting of not more than 18, 6 of whom may be selected by 
the minority) is appointed on a permanent basis solely on the 
basis of fitness to perform the duties of their respective 
positions. The clerical staff (consisting of not more than 
12, 4 of whom may be selected by the minority) is appointed 
to handle correspondence and stenographic work for the 
committee staff and the Chairman and ranking minority Member 
on matters related to committee work. All staff appointments 
are made by a majority vote of the committee without regard 
to race, creed, sex, or age. The minority staff provisions do 
not apply to the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct 
because of its bipartisan nature. The Committee on 
Appropriations and the Committee on the Budget have special 
authority under the rules of the House for appointment of 
staff and assistants for the minority.<p>

 Under certain conditions, a standing committee may appoint 
consultants on a temporary or intermittent basis and also may 
provide financial assistance to members of its professional 
staff for the purpose of acquiring specialized training, 
whenever the committee determines that such training will aid 
the committee in the discharge of its responsibilities.<p>

 
 VI. <a name="committee"><b> CONSIDERATION BY COMMITTEE</b></a><p>

The rules adopted by the caucus of the majority party in 
the House provide that the Chairman of the committee to which 
a bill has been referred must refer the bill to the 
appropriate subcommittee within 2 weeks, unless a majority of 
the Members of the majority party on the committee vote to 
have the bill considered by the full committee. One of the 
first actions taken is the transmittal of copies of the bill 
to the departments and agencies concerned with the subject 
matter and frequently to the General Accounting Office with a 
request for an official report of views on the necessity or 
desirability of enacting the bill into law. Ample time is 
given for the submission of the reports and when received 
they are accorded serious consideration but are not binding 
on the committee in determining whether or not to act 
favorably on the bill. Reports of the departments and 
agencies in the executive branch are submitted first to the 
Office of Management and Budget to determine whether they are 
consistent with the program of the President.<p>

 <b>COMMITTEE MEETINGS</b><p>

 Standing committees are required to have regular meeting 
days at least once a month, but the Chairman may call and 
convene additional meetings. Three or more Members of a 
standing committee may file with the committee a written 
request that the Chairman call a special meeting. The request 
must specify the measure or matter to be considered. If the 
Chairman fails, within 3 calendar days after the filing of 
the request, to call the requested special meeting, to be 
held within 7 calendar days after the filing of the request, 
a majority of the Members of the committee may call the 
special meeting by filing with the committee written notice 
specifying the time and date of the meeting and the measure 
or matter to be considered.<p>

 With the exception of the Committees on Appropriations, on 
the Budget, on Rules, on Standards of Official Conduct, on 
Ways and Means, and on House Administration, committees may 
not, without special permission, meet while the House is 
reading a measure for amendment under the "five-minute rule". 
(See first paragraph under heading "Second Reading" in Part 
XI.) Special permission to meet will be given unless 10 or 
more Members object. The rules of the House also provide that 
House committees may not meet during a joint session of the 
House and Senate or during a recess when a joint meeting of 
the House and Senate is in progress. Committees may meet at 
other times during a recess up to the expiration of the 
constitutional term.<p>

 <b>PUBLIC HEARINGS</b><p>

 If the bill is of sufficient importance, and particularly if 
it is controversial, the committee will usually set a date 
for public hearings. Each committee (except the Committee on 
Rules) is required to make public announcement of the date, 
place, and subject matter of any hearing to be conducted by 
the committee on any measure or matter at least one week 
before the commencement of that hearing, unless the committee 
determines that there is good cause to begin the hearing at 
an earlier date. If the committee makes that determination, 
it must make a public announcement to that effect at the 
earliest possible date. Public announcements are published in 
the Daily Digest portion of the Congressional Record as soon 
as possible after the announcement is made by the committee, 
and are often noted in news papers and periodicals. Personal 
notice, usually in the form of a letter, but possibly in the 
form of a subpena, is sent frequently to individuals, 
organizations, and Government departments and agencies that 
are known to be interested.<p>

 Each hearing by a committee and subcommittee is required to 
be open to the public except when the committee or 
subcommittee, in open session and with a majority present, 
determines by rollcall vote that all or part of the remainder 
of the hearing on that day shall be closed to the public 
because disclosure of testimony, evidence, or other matters 
to be considered would endanger the national security or 
would violate a law or a rule of the House. The committee or 
subcommittee by the same procedure may vote to close one 
subsequent day of hearing, except that the Committees on 
Appropriations and on Armed Services and the Permanent Select 
Committee on Intelligence, and subcommittees of those 
committees, by the same procedure may vote to close up to 5 
additional consecutive days of hearings. When a quorum for 
taking testimony is present, a majority of the Members 
present may close a hearing to discuss whether the evidence 
or testimony to be received would endanger national security 
or would tend to defame, degrade, or incriminate any person.<p>

 Hearings on the budget are required to be held by the 
Committee on Appropriations in open session within 30 days 
after its transmittal to Congress, except when the Committee, 
in open session and with a quorum present, determines by 
rollcall vote that the testimony to be taken at that hearing 
on that day may be related to a matter of national security. 
The Committee may by the same procedure close one subsequent 
day of hearing.<p>

 On the day set for the public hearing an official reporter 
is present to record the testimony in favor of and against 
the bill. The bill may be read in full at the opening of the 
hearings and a copy is inserted in the record. After a brief 
introductory statement by the Chairman and often by the 
ranking minority Member or other committee Member, the first 
witness is called. Members or Senators who wish to be heard 
are given preference out of courtesy and because of the 
limitations on their time. Cabinet officers and high-ranking 
civil and military officials of the Government, as well as 
interested private individuals, testify either voluntarily or 
at the request or summons of the committee.<p>

 Committees require, so far as practicable, that witnesses 
who appear before it file with the committee, in advance of 
their appearance, a written statement of their proposed 
testimony and limit their oral presentations to a brief 
summary of their arguments.<p>

 Minority party Members of the committee are entitled to call 
witnesses of their own to testify on a measure during at 
least one day of the hearing.<p>

 All committee rules in the House must provide that each 
Member shall have only 5 minutes in the interrogation of 
witnesses until each Member of the committee who desires to 
question a witness has had an opportunity to do so.<p>

 A typewritten transcript of the testimony taken at a public 
hearing is made available for inspection in the office of the 
clerk of the committee and frequently the complete transcript 
is printed and distributed widely by the committee.<p>

<b> BUSINESS MEETINGS</b><p>

 After hearings are completed, the subcommittee usually will 
consider the bill in a session that is popularly known as the 
"markup" session. The views of both sides are studied in 
detail and at the conclusion of deliberation a vote is taken 
to determine the action of the subcommittee. It may decide to 
report the bill favorably to the full committee, with or 
without amendment, or unfavorably, or suggest that the 
committee "table" it, that is, postpone action indefinitely. 
Each Member of the subcommittee, regardless of party 
affiliation, has one vote.<p>

 All meetings for the transaction of business, including the 
markup of legislation, of standing committees or 
subcommittees must be open to the public except when the 
committee or subcommittee, in open session with a majority 
present, determines by rollcall vote that all or part of the 
remainder of the meeting on that day shall be closed to the 
public. This requirement does not apply to any meeting that 
relates solely to internal budget or personnel matters. 
Members of the committee may authorize congressional staff 
and departmental representatives to be present at any 
business or markup session that has been closed to the 
public.<p>

<b> COMMITTEE ACTION</b><p>

 At committee meetings reports on bills may be made by 
subcommittees. Reports are fully discussed and amendments may 
be offered. Committee amendments are only proposals to change 
the bill as introduced and are subject to acceptance or 
rejection by the House itself. A vote of committee Members is 
taken to determine whether the full committee will report 
favorably or "table" the bill. If the committee votes to 
report the bill favorably to the House, it may report the 
bill with or without amendments or report a "clean bill". If 
the committee has approved extensive amendments, the 
committee may decide to report a new bill incorporating those 
amendments, commonly known as a "clean bill". The new bill is 
introduced (usually by the Chairman of the committee), and, 
after referral back to the committee, is reported favorably 
to the House by the committee. Because tabling a bill 
normally is effective in preventing action on it, adverse 
reports to the House by the full committee ordinarily are not 
made. On rare occasions, a committee may report a bill 
without recommendation or unfavorably.<p>

 Generally, a majority of the committee constitutes a quorum, 
the number of Members who must be present in order for the 
committee to act. This ensures adequate participation by both 
sides in the action taken. However, a committee may vary the 
number of Members necessary for a quorum for certain actions. 
For example, a committee may fix the number of its Members, 
but not less than 2, necessary for a quorum for taking 
testimony and receiving evidence. Except for the Committees 
on Appropriations, on the Budget, and on Ways and Means, a 
committee may fix the number of its Members, but not less 
than one-third, necessary for a quorum for taking certain 
other actions. The absence of a quorum is the subject of a 
point of order--that is, an objection that the proceedings 
are out of order--that is, that the required number of 
Members is not present.<p>

<b> PUBLIC INSPECTION OF RESULTS OF ROLLCALL VOTE IN COMMITTEE</b><p>

 The result of each rollcall vote in any meeting of a 
committee must be made available by that committee for 
inspection by the public at reasonable times in the offices 
of that committee. Information available for public 
inspection includes (1) a description of each amendment, 
motion, order, or other proposition, (2) the name of each 
Member voting for and each Member voting against the 
amendment, motion, order, or proposition, and whether by 
proxy or in person, and (3) the names of those Members 
present but not voting.<p>

 With respect to each rollcall vote by a committee on a 
motion to report a bill or resolution of a public character, 
the total number of votes cast for, and the total number of 
votes cast against, the reporting of the bill or resolution 
must be included in the committee report.<p>

<b> PROXY VOTING</b><p>
 A vote by a Member of a committee with respect to a measure 
or other matter may not be cast by proxy unless that 
committee adopts a written rule that permits voting by proxy 
and requires that the proxy authorization (1) be in writing, 
(2) assert that the Member is absent on official business or 
is otherwise unable to be present at the meeting of the 
committee, (3) designate the person who is to execute the 
proxy authorization, and (4) be limited to a specific measure 
or matter and any amendments or motions pertaining to the 
measure or matter. A Member may authorize a general proxy 
only for motions to recess, adjourn or other procedural 
matters. A proxy must be signed by the Member and must 
contain the date and time of day that it is signed. A proxy 
may not be counted for a quorum.<p>

 <b>POINTS OF ORDER WITH RESPECT TO COMMITTEE PROCEDURE</b><p>

 A point of order does not lie with respect to a measure 
reported by a committee on the ground that hearings on the 
measure were not conducted in accordance with required 
committee procedure. However, certain points of order may be 
made by a Member of the committee which reported the measure 
if, in the committee, that point of order was (1) timely made 
and (2) improperly overruled or not properly considered.<p>

<b> BROADCASTING COMMITTEE HEARINGS AND MEETINGS</b><p>

 It is permissible to cover open committee hearings and 
meetings in the House by television, radio, and still 
photography. This permission is granted under well defined 
conditions as provided in the rules of the House. Similarly, 
the rules of the Senate permit broadcasting of open hearings 
of a Senate committee under such rules as the committee may 
adopt.<p>

 
 VII. <a name="reported bills"><b>REPORTED BILLS</b></a><p>

  If the committee votes to report the bill favorably to the 
House, one of the Members is designated to write the 
committee report. The report describes the purpose and scope 
of the bill and the reasons for its recommended approval. 
Generally, a section-by-section analysis is set forth in 
detail explaining precisely what each section is intended to 
accomplish. All changes in existing law must be indicated in 
the report and the text of laws being repealed must be set 
out. This requirement is known as the "Ramseyer" rule; a 
similar rule in the Senate is known as the "Cordon" rule. 
Committee amendments also must be set out at the beginning of 
the report and explanations of them are included. Executive 
communications regarding the bill usually are quoted in full.<p>

 If at the time of approval of a bill by a committee (except 
the Committee on Rules) a Member of the committee gives 
notice of an intention to file supplemental, minority, or 
additional views, that Member is entitled to not less than 3 
calendar days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal 
holidays) in which to file those views with the clerk of the 
committee and they must be included in the report on the 
bill. Committee reports, with certain exceptions, must be 
filed while the House actually is sitting unless unanimous 
consent is obtained from the House to file at a later time.<p>

 The report is assigned a report number when it is filed, and 
it is delivered to the Government Printing Office for 
printing during that night. Beginning with the 91st Congress, 
in 1969, the report number contains a prefix-designator which 
indicates the number of the Congress. For example, the first 
House report in 1969 was numbered 91-1.<p>

 The bill is reprinted when reported and committee amendments 
are indicated by showing new matter in italics and deleted 
matter in line-through type. The report number is printed on 
the bill and the calendar number is shown on both the first 
and back pages of the bill. However, in the case of a bill 
that was referred to 2 or more committees for consideration 
in sequence, the calendar number is printed only on the bill 
as reported by the last committee to consider it. See Part 
IX, "Calendars".<p>

 Committee reports are perhaps the most valuable single 
element of the legislative history of a law. They are used by 
courts, executive departments and agencies, and the public 
generally, as a source of information regarding the purpose 
and meaning of the law.<p>

<b> CONTENTS OF REPORTS</b><p>

 The report of a committee on a measure that has been 
approved by the committee must include (1) the committee's 
oversight findings and recommendations, (2) the statement 
required by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, if the 
measure provides new budget authority (other than continuing 
appropriations), certain new spending authority, new credit 
authority, or an increase or decrease in revenues or tax 
expenditures, (3) the cost estimate and comparison prepared 
by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office whenever 
the Director has submitted that estimate and comparison to 
the committee prior to the filing of the report, and (4) a 
summary of the oversight findings and recommendations made by 
the Committee on Government Operations whenever they have 
been submitted to the legislative committee in a timely 
fashion to allow an opportunity to consider the findings and 
recommendations during the committee's deliberations on the 
measure. Each of these items are set out separately and 
clearly identified in the report. For a discussion of the 
Congressional budget process, see Part XII.<p>

<b> INFLATIONARY IMPACT AND COST ESTIMATES IN REPORTS</b><p>

 In addition, each report of a committee on a bill or joint 
resolution of a public character reported by the committee 
must contain a detailed analytical statement as to whether 
the enactment of the bill or joint resolution into law may 
have an inflationary impact on prices and costs in the 
operation of the national  economy.<p>

 Each report also must contain an estimate, made by the 
committee, of the costs which would be incurred in carrying 
out that bill or joint resolution in the fiscal year reported 
and in each of the 5 fiscal years thereafter or for the 
duration of the program authorized if less than 5 years. In 
the case of a measure involving revenues, the report need 
contain only an estimate of the gain or loss in revenues for 
a one-year period. The report must include a comparison of 
the estimates of those costs with the estimate made by any 
Government agency and submitted to that committee. The 
Committees on Appropriations, on House Administration, on 
Rules, and on Standards of Official Conduct are not required 
to include cost estimates in their reports. In addition, the 
cost estimates are not required to be included in reports 
when a cost estimate and comparison prepared by the Director 
of the Congressional Budget Office has been submitted prior 
to the filing of the report and included in the report.<p>

 <b>FILING OF REPORTS</b><p>

 Measures approved by a committee must be reported promptly 
after approval. A majority of the Members of the committee 
may file a written request with the clerk of the committee 
for the reporting of the measure. When the request is filed, 
the clerk immediately must notify the Chairman of the 
committee of the filing of the request, and the report on the 
measure must be filed within 7 days (excluding days on which 
the House is not in session) after the day on which the 
request is filed. This does not apply to a report of the 
Committee on Rules with respect to the rules, joint rules, or 
order of business of the House or to the reporting of a 
resolution of inquiry addressed to the head of an executive 
department.<p>

<b> AVAILABILITY OF REPORTS AND HEARINGS</b><p>

 With certain exceptions (relating to emergency situations, 
such as a measure declaring war or other national emergency 
and Government agency decisions, determinations, and actions 
that are effective unless disapproved or otherwise 
invalidated by one or both Houses of Congress), a measure or 
matter reported by a committee (except the Committee on Rules 
in the case of a resolution making in order the consideration 
of a bill, resolution, or other order of business) may not be 
considered in the House until the third calendar day 
(excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) on which 
the report of that committee on that measure has been 
available to the Members of the House. In addition, the 
measure or matter may not be considered unless copies of the 
report and the reported measure or matter have been available 
to the Members for at least 3 calendar days (excluding 
Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays during which the House 
is not in session) before the beginning of consideration. 
However, it is always in order to consider a report from the 
Committee on Rules specifically providing for the 
consideration of a reported measure or matter notwithstanding 
this restriction. If hearings were held on a measure or 
matter so reported, the committee is required to make every 
reasonable effort to have those hearings printed and 
available for distribution to the Members of the House prior 
to the consideration of the measure in the House. General 
appropriation bills may not be considered until printed 
committee hearings and a committee report thereon have been 
available to the Members of the House for at least 3 calendar 
days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays).<p>

 
 VIII. <a name="legislative"><b>LEGISLATIVE REVIEW BY STANDING COMMITTEES</b></a><p>

  Each standing committee (other than the Committees on 
Appropriations and on the Budget) is required to review and 
study, on a continuing basis, the application, 
administration, execution, and effectiveness of the laws 
dealing with the subject matter over which the committee has 
jurisdiction and the organization and operation of Federal 
agencies and entities having responsibility for the 
administration and evaluation of those laws.<p>

 The purpose of the review and study is to determine whether 
laws and the programs created by Congress are being 
implemented and carried out in accordance with the intent of 
Congress and whether those programs should be continued, 
curtailed, or eliminated. In addition, each committee having 
oversight responsibility is required to review and study any 
conditions or circumstances that may indicate the necessity 
or desirability of enacting new or additional legislation 
within the jurisdiction of that committee, and must 
undertake, on a continuing basis, futures research and 
forecasting on matters within the jurisdiction of that 
committee. Each standing committee also has the function of 
reviewing and studying, on a continuing basis, the impact or 
probable impact of tax policies on subjects within its 
jurisdiction.<p>

 In addition, several of the standing committees have special 
oversight responsibilities, the details of which are 
contained in the rules of the House.
<p>
 
 IX. <a name="calendar"><b>CALENDARS</b><p></a>

  The House of Representatives has 5 calendars of business: 
the Union Calendar, the House Calendar, the Private Calendar, 
the Consent Calendar, and the Calendar of Motions to 
Discharge Committees. The calendars, together with a listing 
of all bills introduced and a history of all bills reported 
out of committee in the current Congress, are printed each 
day the House is in session to provide information on the 
status of pending legislation.<p>

 As soon as a public bill is favorably reported, it is 
assigned a calendar number on either the Union Calendar or 
the House Calendar, the 2 principal calendars of business. 
The calendar number is printed on the first page of the bill 
and, in certain instances, is printed also on the back page. 
In the case of a bill that was referred to 2 or more 
committees for consideration in sequence, the calendar number 
is printed only on the bill as reported by the last committee 
to consider it.<p>

<b> UNION CALENDAR</b><p>

 The rules of the House provide that there shall be:<p>

 First. A Calendar of the Committee of the Whole House on the 
state of the Union, to which shall be referred bills raising 
revenue, general appropriation bills, and bills of a public 
character directly or indirectly appropriating money or 
property.<p>

 
 This is commonly known as the Union Calendar and the large 
majority of public bills and resolutions are placed on it on 
being reported to the House. For a discussion of the 
Committee of the Whole House, see Part XI.<p>

 <b>HOUSE CALENDAR</b><p>

 The rules further provide that there shall be:<p>

 Second. A House Calendar, to which shall be referred all 
bills of a public character not raising revenue nor directly 
or indirectly appropriating money or property.<p>

 
 The public bills and resolutions that are not placed on the 
Union Calendar are referred to the House Calendar.<p>

<b> PRIVATE CALENDAR</b><p>

 The rules also provide that there shall be:<p>

 Third. A Calendar of the Committee of the Whole House, to 
which shall be referred all bills of a private character.<p>

 
 This is commonly known as the Private Calendar and all 
private bills are placed on it on being reported to the 
House. The Private Calendar is called on the first and third 
Tuesdays of each month.  If objection is made by 2 or more 
Members to the consideration of any measure called, it is 
recommitted to the committee that reported it. As in the case 
of the Consent Calendar (see below) there are 6 official 
objectors, 3 on the majority side and 3 on the minority side, 
who make a careful study of each bill or resolution on the 
Private Calendar and who will object to a measure that does 
not conform to the requirements for that calendar, thereby 
preventing the passage without debate of nonmeritorious bills 
and resolutions.<p>

<b>CONSENT CALENDAR</b><p>

 If a measure pending on either the House or Union Calendar 
is of a noncontroversial nature, it may be placed on the 
Consent Calendar. After a bill has been favorably reported 
and is on either the House or Union Calendar, any Member may 
file with the Clerk a notice that the Member desires the bill 
placed on the Consent Calendar. On the first and third 
Mondays of each month immediately after the reading of the 
Journal, the Speaker directs the Clerk to call the bills in 
numerical order (that is, in the order of their appearance on 
that calendar) that have been on the Consent Calendar for 3 
legislative days. If objection is made to the consideration 
of any bill so called, it is carried over on the calendar 
without prejudice to the next day when the Consent Calendar 
is again called, and if then objected to by 3 or more Members 
it is immediately stricken from the calendar and may not be 
placed on the Consent Calendar again during that session of 
Congress. If objection is not made and if the bill is not 
"passed over" by request, it is passed by unanimous consent 
without debate. Ordinarily, the only amendments considered 
are those sponsored by the committee that reported the bill.<p>

 To avoid the passage without debate of measures that may be 
controversial or are sufficiently important or complex to 
require full discussion, there are 6 official objectors--3 on 
the majority side and 3 on the minority side--who make a 
careful study of bills on the Consent Calendar. If a bill 
involves the expenditure of more than a fixed maximum amount 
of money or if it changes national policy or has other 
aspects that any of the objectors believes demand explanation 
and extended debate, it will be objected to and will not be 
passed by unanimous consent. That action does not necessarily 
mean the final defeat of the bill because it may then be 
brought up for consideration in the same way as any other 
bill on the House or Union Calendars.<p>

<b> CALENDAR OF MOTIONS TO DISCHARGE COMMITTEES</b><p>
 When a majority of the Members of the House sign a motion to 
discharge a committee from consideration of a public bill or 
resolution, that motion is referred to the Calendar of 
Motions to Discharge Committees. For a further discussion of 
Motions to Discharge, see "Motion to Discharge Committee" in 
Part X.<p>

 X. <a name="measures"><b> OBTAINING CONSIDERATION OF MEASURES</b></a><p>

  Obviously certain measures pending on the House and Union 
Calendars are more important and urgent than others and it is 
necessary to have a system permitting their consideration 
ahead of those that do not require immediate action. Because 
all measures are placed on those calendars in the order in 
which they are reported to the House, the latest bill 
reported would be the last to be taken up if the calendar 
number alone were the determining factor.<p>

 <b>SPECIAL RESOLUTIONS</b><p>

 To avoid delays and to provide some degree of selectivity in 
the consideration of measures, it is possible to have them 
taken up out of order by obtaining from the Committee on 
Rules a special resolution or "rule" for their consideration. 
That Committee, which is composed of majority and minority 
Members but with a larger proportion of majority Members than 
other committees, is specifically granted jurisdiction over 
resolutions relating to the order of business of the House. 
Usually the Chairman of the committee that has favorably 
reported the bill appears before the Committee on Rules 
accompanied by the sponsor of the measure and one or more 
Members of the Chariman's committee in support of the request 
for a resolution providing for its immediate consideration. 
If the Committee on Rules is satisfied that the measure 
should be taken up it will report a resolution reading 
substantially as follows with respect to a bill on the Union 
Calendar:<p>

 Resolved, That upon the adoption of this resolution it shall 
be in order to move that the House resolve itself into the 
Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union for 
the consideration of the bill (H.R. ___) entitled, etc., and 
the first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. After 
general debate, which shall be confined to the bill and shall 
continue not to exceed __ hours, to be equally divided and 
controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the 
Committee on ___, the bill shall be read for amendment under 
the five-minute rule. At the conclusion of the consideration 
of the bill for amendment, the Committee shall rise and 
report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have 
been adopted, and the previous question shall be considered 
as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final 
passage without intervening motion except one motion to 
recommit.<p>

 
 If the measure is on the House Calendar the resolution reads 
substantially as follows:<p>

 Resolved, That upon the adoption of this resolution it shall 
be in order to consider the bill (H.R. ___) entitled, etc., 
in the House.<p>

 
 The resolution may waive points of order against the bill. 
When it limits or prevents floor amendments, it is popularly 
known as a "closed rule".<p>

<b> CONSIDERATION OF MEASURES MADE IN ORDER BY PREVIOUS 
RESOLUTION</b><p>

 When a "rule" has been reported to the House, and is not 
considered immediately, it is referred to the calendar and, 
if not called up for consideration by the Member making the 
report within 7 legislative days thereafter, any Member of 
the Committee on Rules may call it up as a question of 
privilege (after having given one calendar day notice of the 
Member's intention to do so) and the Speaker will recognize 
any Member of the Committee seeking recognition for that 
purpose. For a discussion of privileged questions, see the 
matter under the heading "Privileged Matters" at the end of 
this part.<p>

 If, within 7 calendar days after a measure has, by 
resolution, been made in order for consideration by the 
House, a motion has not been offered for its consideration, 
the Speaker may recognize a Member of the committee that 
reported the measure to offer a motion that the House 
consider it, if the Member has been duly authorized by that 
committee to offer the motion.<p>

 There are several other methods of obtaining consideration 
of bills that either have not been reported by a committee 
or, if reported, for which a special resolution or "rule" has 
not been obtained. Two of those methods, a motion to 
discharge a committee and a motion to suspend the rules, are 
discussed below.<p>

<b> MOTION TO DISCHARGE COMMITTEE</b><p>

 A Member may present to the Clerk a motion in writing to 
discharge a committee from the consideration of a public bill 
or resolution that has been referred to it 30 days prior 
thereto. A Member also may file a motion to discharge the 
Committee on Rules from further consideration of a resolution 
providing either a special order of business, or a special 
rule for the consideration of a public bill or resolution 
favorably reported by a standing committee, or a special rule 
for the consideration of a public bill or resolution that has 
remained in a standing committee 30 days or more without 
action. This motion may be made only when the resolution, 
from which it is moved to discharge the Committee on Rules, 
has been referred to that committee at least 7 days prior to 
the filing of the motion to discharge. The motion is placed 
in the custody of the Clerk, who arranges some convenient 
place for the signature of Members. When a majority of the 
total membership of the House have signed the motion, it is 
entered on the Journal, printed with the signatures thereto 
in the Congressional Record, and referred to the Calendar of 
Motions to Discharge Committees.<p>

 On the second and fourth Mondays of each month, except 
during the last 6 days of a session, a Member who has signed 
a motion to discharge, that has been on the calendar at least 
7 days, may seek recognition and be recognized for the 
purpose of calling up the motion. The bill or resolution is 
then read by title only. After 20 minutes' debate, one-half 
in favor of the proposition and one-half in opposition, the 
House proceeds to vote on the motion to discharge.<p>

 If the motion to discharge the Committee on Rules from a 
resolution pending before the Committee prevails, the House 
immediately votes on the adoption of that resolution.<p>

 If the motion to discharge one of the standing committees of 
the House from a public bill or resolution pending before the 
committee prevails, a Member who signed the motion may move 
that the House proceed to the immediate consideration of the 
bill or resolution. If the motion is agreed to, the bill or 
resolution is considered immediately under the general rules 
of the House. If the House votes against the motion for 
immediate consideration, the bill or resolution is referred 
to its proper calendar with the same rights and privileges it 
would have had if reported favorably by the standing 
committee.<p>

<b> MOTION TO SUSPEND THE RULES</b><p>

 On Monday and Tuesday of each week and during the last 6 
days of a session, the Speaker may entertain a motion to 
suspend the rules of the House and pass a bill or resolution. 
Arrangement must be made in advance with the Speaker to 
recognize the Member who wishes to offer the motion. Before 
being considered by the House, the motion must be seconded by 
a majority of the Members present, by teller vote, if 
demanded. However, a second is not required on a motion to 
suspend the rules when printed copies of the proposed bill or 
resolution have been available for one legislative day before 
the motion is considered. The motion to suspend the rules and 
pass the bill is then debated for 40 minutes, one-half by 
those in favor of the proposition and one-half by those 
opposed. The motion may not be amended and if amendments to 
the bill are proposed they must be included in the motion 
when it is made. The rules may be suspended and the bill 
passed only by affirmative vote of two-thirds of the Members 
voting, a quorum being present.<p>

 The Speaker may postpone all recorded and yea-nay votes on 
motions to suspend the rules and pass bills and resolutions 
until the end of that legislative day or the next 2 
legislative days. At that time the House disposes of the 
deferred votes consecutively without further debate. After 
the first deferred vote is taken, the Speaker may reduce to 
not less than 5 minutes the time period for subsequent 
deferred votes. If the House adjourns before completing 
action on one or more deferred votes, these must be the first 
order of business on the next legislative day. By eliminating 
intermittent recorded votes on suspensions, this procedure 
reduces interruptions of committee meetings and also reduces 
the time Members spend on suspension days going back and 
forth between the floor and their committee rooms or offices.<p>

<b> CALENDAR WEDNESDAY</b><p>

 On Wednesday of each week, unless dispensed with by 
unanimous consent or by affirmative vote of two-thirds of the 
Members voting, a quorum being present, the standing 
committees are called in alphabetical order. A committee when 
named may call up for consideration any bill reported by it 
on a previous day and pending on either the House or Union 
Calendar. Not more than 2 hours of general debate is 
permitted on any measure called up on Calendar Wednesday and 
all debate must be confined to the subject matter of the 
measure, the time being equally divided between those for and 
those against it. The affirmative vote of a simple majority 
of the Members present is sufficient to pass the measure.<p>

 <b>DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA BUSINESS</b><p>

 The second and fourth Mondays in each month, after the 
disposition of motions to discharge committees and after the 
disposal of business on the Speaker's table requiring only 
referral to committee, are set aside, when claimed by the 
Committee on the District of Columbia, for the consideration 
of any business that is presented by that Committee.<p>

<b> PRIVILEGED MATTERS</b><p>

 Under the rules of the House certain matters are regarded as 
privileged matters and may interrupt the order of business, 
for example, reports from the Committee on Rules and reports 
from the Committee on Appropriations on the general 
appropriation bills.<p>

 At any time after the reading of the Journal, a Member, by 
direction of the appropriate committee, may move that the 
House resolve itself into the Committee of the Whole House on 
the State of the Union for the purpose of considering bills 
raising revenues, or general appropriation bills. General 
appropriation bills may not be considered in the House until 
3 calendar days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal 
holidays) after printed committee reports and hearings on 
them have been available to the Members. The limit on general 
debate is generally fixed by unanimous consent.<p>

 Other examples of privileged matters are conference reports, 
certain amendments to measures by the Senate, veto messages 
from the President of the United States, and resolutions 
privileged pursuant to statute. The Member in charge of such 
a matter may call it up at practically any time for immediate 
consideration. Usually, this is done after consultation with 
both the majority and minority floor leaders so that the 
Members of both parties will have advance notice and will not 
be taken by surprise.<p>

 
 XI. <a name="consideration"><b>CONSIDERATION</b></a><p>

  Our democratic tradition demands that bills be given 
consideration by the entire membership with adequate 
opportunity for debate and the proposing of amendments.<p>

<b> COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE HOUSE</b><p>

 In order to expedite the consideration of bills and 
resolutions, the rules of the House provide for a 
parliamentary usage that enables the House to act with a 
quorum of less than the requisite majority of 218. The House 
resolves itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the 
State of the Union (a quorum of which consists of 100 
Members) to consider a measure. All measures on the Union 
Calendar--involving a tax, making appropriations, or 
authorizing payments out of appropriations already made--must 
be first considered in the Committee of the Whole.<p>

 The Committee on Rules reports a special resolution or 
"rule" allowing for immediate consideration of a measure by 
the Committee of the Whole. After adoption of the resolution 
by the House, the House votes on a motion to resolve itself 
into the Committee of the Whole or, in certain situations, 
the Speaker declares the House resolved into the Committee of 
the Whole without intervening motion. When the House resolves 
into the Committee of the Whole, the Speaker leaves the chair 
after appointing a Chairman to preside.<p>

 The special resolution or "rule" referred to in the 
preceding paragraph also fixes the length of the debate in 
the Committee of the Whole. This may vary according to the 
importance and controversial nature of the measure. As 
provided in the resolution, the control of the time is 
divided equally--usually between the Chairman and the ranking 
minority Member of the committee that reported the measure. 
Members seeking to speak for or against the measure usually 
arrange in advance with the Member in control of the time on 
their respective side to be allowed a certain amount of time 
in the debate. Others may ask the Member speaking at the time 
to yield to them for a question or a brief statement. A 
transcript of the proceedings and debate in the House and the 
Senate is printed daily in the Congressional Record. 
Frequently permission is granted a Member by unanimous 
consent to extend the Member's remarks in the Congressional 
Record if sufficient time to make a lengthy oral statement is 
not available during actual debate.<p>

 The conduct of the debate is governed principally by the 
rules of the House that are adopted at the opening of each 
Congress. Another recognized authority is Jefferson's Manual 
that was prepared by Thomas Jefferson for his own guidance as 
President of the Senate from 1797 to 1801. The House, in 
1837, adopted a rule that still stands, providing that the 
provisions of Jefferson's Manual should govern the House in 
all cases to which they are applicable and in which they are 
not inconsistent with the rules and orders of the House. In 
addition, there is a most valuable compilation of precedents 
up to the year 1935 set out in Hinds' Precedents and Cannon's 
Precedents of the House of Representatives, consisting of 11 
volumes, to guide the action of the House. A later 
compilation, Deschler's Precedents of the House of 
Representatives, covers years 1936 to date. Summaries of the 
House precedents prior to 1959 can be found in a single 
volume entitled Cannon's Procedure in the House of 
Representatives. A later volume, Procedure in the U.S. House 
of Representatives, fourth edition, as supplemented, is a 
compilation of the parliamentary precedents of the House, in 
summary form, together with other useful related material, 
from 1959 to date. Also, various rulings of the Speaker since 
1931 are set out as notes to the current House Rules and 
Manual. Most parliamentary questions arising during the 
course of debate are susceptible of ruling backed up by a 
precedent of action in a similar situation. The 
Parliamentarian of the House is present in the House Chamber 
in order to assist the Chairman or the Speaker in making a 
correct ruling on parliamentary questions.<p>

<b> SECOND READING</b><p>

 During the general debate an accurate account is kept of the 
time used on both sides and when all the time allowed under 
the rule has been consumed the Chairman terminates the 
debate. Then begins the "second reading of the bill", section 
by section, at which time amendments may be offered to a 
section when it is read. A Member is permitted 5 minutes to 
explain the proposed amendment, after which the Member who is 
first recognized by the Chair is allowed to speak for 5 
minutes in opposition to it; there is no further debate on 
that amendment, thereby effectively preventing any attempt at 
filibuster tactics. This is known as the "five-minute rule". 
There is, how ever, a device whereby a Member may offer a pro 
forma amendment--"to strike out the last word"--without 
intending any change in the language, and be allowed 5 
minutes for debate, thus permitting a somewhat more 
comprehensive debate. Each amendment is put to the Committee 
of the Whole for adoption. Generally, a pro forma amendment 
is withdrawn. However, in the absence of being withdrawn, it 
must be voted on.<p>

 At any time after a debate is begun under the five-minute 
rule, on proposed amendments to a section or paragraph of a 
bill, the Committee of the Whole may by majority vote of the 
Members present, close debate on the section or paragraph. 
However, if debate is closed on a section or paragraph before 
there has been debate on any amendment that a Member has 
caused to be printed in the Congressional Record after the 
reporting of the bill by the committee but at least one day 
prior to floor consideration of the amendment, the Member who 
caused the amendment to be printed in the Record is given 5 
minutes in which to explain the amendment, after which the 
first person to obtain the floor has 5 minutes to speak in 
opposition to it, and there is no further debate on that 
proposed amendment. However, time for debate is not allowed 
when the offering of the amendment is dilatory. Material 
placed in the Congressional Record must indicate the full 
text of the proposed amendment, the name of the proponent 
Member, the number of the bill to which it will be offered 
and the point in the bill or amendment thereto where the 
amendment is intended to be offered, and must appear in a 
portion of the Record designated for that purpose.<p>

 When an amendment is offered, while the House is meeting in 
the Committee of the Whole, the Clerk is required to transmit 
5 copies of the amendment to the majority committee table, 5 
copies to the minority committee table, and at least one copy 
each to the majority and minority cloak rooms.<p>

<b>THE COMMITTEE "RISES"</b><p>

 At the conclusion of the consideration of a bill for 
amendment, the Committee of the Whole "rises" and reports the 
bill to the House with the amendments that have been adopted. 
In rising the Committee of the Whole reverts back to the 
House and the Chairman of the Committee is replaced in the 
chair by the Speaker of the House. The House then acts on the 
bill and any amendments adopted by the Committee of the 
Whole.<p>

<b> HOUSE ACTION</b><p>

 Debate is cut off by moving "the previous question". If this 
motion is carried by a majority of the Members voting, a 
quorum being present, all debate is cut off on the bill on 
which the previous question has been ordered. The Speaker 
then puts the question: "Shall the bill be engrossed and read 
a third time?" If this question is decided in the 
affirmative, the bill is read a third time by title only and 
voted on for passage.<p>

 If the previous question has been ordered by the terms of 
the special resolution or "rule" on a bill reported by the 
Committee of the Whole, the House immediately votes on 
whatever amendments have been reported by the Committee in 
the sequence in which they were reported. After completion of 
voting on the amendments, the House immediately votes on the 
passage of the bill with the amendments it has adopted.<p>

 In those cases where the previous question has not been 
ordered, the House may engage in debate lasting one hour, at 
the conclusion of which the previous question is ordered and 
the House votes on the passage of the bill. During the debate 
it is in order to offer amendments to the bill or to the 
Committee amendments.<p>

 The Speaker may postpone a vote on final passage of a bill 
or resolution or agreement to a conference report. A vote may 
be postponed for up to 2 legislative days.<p>

 Measures that do not have to be considered in the Committee 
of the Whole are considered in the House in the first 
instance under the hour rule or in accordance with the terms 
of the special resolution limiting debate on the measure.<p>

 After passage of the bill by the House, a pro forma motion 
to reconsider it is automatically made and laid on the table-
-that is, action is postponed indefinitely--to forestall this 
motion at a later date, because the vote of the House on a 
proposition is not final and conclusive on the House until 
there has been an opportunity to reconsider it.<p>

<b> MOTIONS TO RECOMMIT</b><p>

 After the previous question has been ordered on the passage 
of a bill or joint resolution, it is in order to make one 
motion to recommit the bill or joint resolution to a 
committee and the Speaker is required to give preference in 
recognition for that purpose to a Member who is opposed to 
the bill or joint resolution. This motion is normally not 
subject to debate. However, with respect to a motion to 
recommit with instructions after the previous question has 
been ordered, it is in order to debate the motion for 10 
minutes before the vote is taken, except that the majority 
floor manager may demand that the debate be extended to one 
hour. Whatever time is allotted for debate is divided equally 
between the proponents and opponents of the motion.<p>

<b> QUORUM CALLS AND ROLLCALLS</b><p>

 In order to speed up and expedite quorum calls and 
rollcalls, the rules of the House provide alternative methods 
for pursuing these procedures.<p>

 In the absence of a quorum, 15 Members, including the 
Speaker, if there is one, are authorized to compel the 
attendance of absent Members. Such a call of the House is 
ordered by a majority vote, and a minority of 15 or more 
favoring a call is not sufficient. A call of the House is 
then ordered, and the Speaker is required to have the call 
taken by electronic device. However, the Speaker instead may 
name one or more clerks "to tell" the Members who are 
present. In that case the names of those present are recorded 
by the clerks, and entered in the Journal of the House and 
absent Members have not less than 15 minutes from the 
ordering of the call of the House to have their presence 
recorded. If sufficient excuse is not offered for their 
absence, by order of a majority of those present, they may be 
sent for by officers appointed by the Sergeant-at-Arms for 
that purpose, and their attendance secured and retained. The 
House then determines the conditions on which they may be 
discharged. Members who voluntarily appear are, unless the 
House otherwise directs, immediately admitted to the Hall of 
the House and they must report their names to the Clerk to be 
entered on the Journal as present. However, the former 
practice of presenting Members at the Bar of the House, 
during a call, is now obsolete, and Members now report to the 
Clerk and are recorded without being formally excused unless 
brought in under compulsion.<p>

 Whenever a quorum fails to vote on any question, and a 
quorum is not present and objection is made for that reason, 
there is a call of the House unless the House adjourns. The 
call is taken by electronic device unless the Speaker orders 
the call in the manner described in the preceding paragraph, 
and the Sergeant-at-Arms proceeds to bring in absent Members. 
The yeas and nays on the pending question are at the same 
time considered as ordered and an automatic rollcall vote is 
taken. The Clerk calls the roll and each Member who is 
present may vote on the pending question as the Member 
answers the roll. After the rollcall is completed, each 
Member, whose attendance was secured, is brought before the 
House by the Sergeant-at-Arms, where the Member's presence is 
noted. The Member then is given an opportunity to vote. If 
those voting on the question and those who are present and 
decline to vote together make a majority of the House, the 
Speaker declares that a quorum is constituted, and the 
pending question is decided according to the will of the 
majority of those voting. Further proceedings under the call 
are considered as dispensed with. At any time after the 
rollcall has been completed, the Speaker may entertain a 
motion to adjourn, if seconded by a majority of those present 
as ascertained by actual count by the Speaker; and if the 
House adjourns, all quorum call proceedings are vacated.<p>

 The rules prohibit points of no quorum (1) before or during 
the daily prayer, (2) during administration of the oath of 
office to the Speaker or any Member, (3) during the reception 
of messages from the President or the Senate, (4) in 
connection with motions incidental to a call of the House, 
and (5) against a vote in which the Committee of the Whole 
agrees to rise (but an appropriate point of no quorum would 
be permitted against a vote defeating a motion to rise). If 
the presence of a quorum has been established at least once 
on any day, further points of no quorum are prohibited (1) 
during the reading of the Journal, (2) between the time a 
Committee of the Whole rises and its Chairman reports, and 
(3) during the period on any legislative day when Members are 
addressing the House under special orders. The language 
prohibiting quorum calls "during any period" when Members are 
speaking under special orders includes the time between 
addresses delivered during this period as well as the 
addresses themselves. Furthermore, a quorum call is not in 
order when no business has intervened since the previous 
call. For the purposes of this provision, all the situations 
described above are not to be considered as "business".<p>

 The rules prohibit points of no quorum when a motion or 
proposition is pending in the House unless the Speaker has 
put the motion or proposition to a vote. However, the Speaker 
has the discretion to recognize a Member of the Speaker's 
choice to move a call of the House.<p>

 The first time the Committee of the Whole finds itself 
without a quorum during any day the Chairman is required to 
order the roll to be called by electronic device, unless the 
Chairman orders a call by naming clerks "to tell" the Members 
as described above. However, the Chairman may refuse to 
entertain a point of order that a quorum is not present 
during general debate. If on a call a quorum appears, the 
Committee continues its business. If a quorum does not 
appear, the Committee rises and the Chairman reports the 
names of the absentees to the House. The rules provide for 
the expeditious conduct of quorum calls in the Committee of 
the Whole. The Chairman may suspend a quorum call after 
determining that a bare or minimum quorum has been reached, 
that is, 100 or more Members. Under such a short quorum call 
the Committee will not rise, and therefore Members' names 
will not be published. Once the presence of a quorum of the 
Committee of the Whole has been established for the day, 
quorum calls in the Committee are only in order when the 
Committee is operating under the five-minute rule and the 
Chairman has put the pending motion or proposition to a vote.<p>

<b> VOTING</b><p>

 There are 4 methods of voting in the Committee of the Whole, 
that are also employed, together with an additional method, 
in the House. These are the voice vote (viva voce), the 
division, the teller vote, the recorded vote, and the yea-
and-nay vote that is used only in the House. If a Member 
objects to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not 
present in the House, there may be an automatic rollcall 
vote.<p>

 To obtain a voice vote the Chair states "As many as are in 
favor (as the question may be) say `Aye'." "As many as are 
opposed, say `No'.". The Chair determines the result on the 
basis of the volume of ayes and noes. This is the form in 
which the vote is ordinarily taken in the first instance.<p>

 If it is difficult to determine the result of a voice vote, 
a division may be demanded. The Chair then states that a 
division has been demanded and says "As many as are in favor 
will rise and stand until counted." After counting those in 
favor he calls on those opposed to stand and be counted, 
thereby determining the number in favor of and those opposed 
to the question.<p>

 If a demand for a teller vote is supported by one-fifth of a 
quorum (20 in the Committee of the Whole, and 44 in the 
House), the Chair appoints one or more tellers from each side 
and directs the Members in favor of the proposition to pass 
between the tellers and be counted. After counting, a teller 
announces the number in the affirmative, and the Chair then 
directs the Members opposed to pass between the tellers and 
be counted. When the count is stated by a teller, the Chair 
announces the result.<p>

 If any Member requests a recorded vote and that request is 
supported by at least one-fifth of a quorum of the House, or 
25 Members in the Committee of the Whole, the vote is taken 
by electronic device, unless the Speaker orders clerks "to 
tell", that is, record the names of those voting on each side 
of the question. After the recorded vote is concluded, the 
names of those voting together with those not voting are 
entered in the Journal. Members usually have 15 minutes to be 
counted from the time the recorded vote is ordered or the 
ordering of the clerks "to tell" the vote. The Speaker may 
reduce the period for voting to 5 minutes in certain 
situations.<p>

 In addition to the foregoing methods of voting, in the 
House, if the yeas and nays are demanded, the Speaker directs 
those in favor of taking the vote by that method to stand and 
be counted. The assent of one-fifth of the Members present 
(as distinguished from one-fifth of a quorum in the case of a 
demand for tellers) is necessary for ordering the yeas and 
nays. When the yeas and nays are ordered (or a point of order 
is made that a quorum is not present) the Speaker directs 
that as many as are in favor of the proposition will, as 
their names are called, answer "Aye"; as many as are opposed 
will answer "No". The Clerk calls the roll and reports the 
result to the Speaker who announces it to the House. The 
Speaker is not required to vote unless the Speaker's vote 
would be decisive.<p>

 The rules prohibit a Member from (1) casting another 
Member's vote or recording another Member's presence in the 
House or the Committee of the Whole or (2) authorizing 
another individual to cast a vote or record the Member's 
presence in the House or the Committee of the Whole.<p>

<b> ELECTRONIC VOTING</b><p>

 Recorded and rollcall votes are usually taken by electronic 
device, except when the Speaker orders the vote to be 
recorded by other methods prescribed by the rules of the 
House, and in emergency situations, such as, the failure of 
the electronic device to function. In addition, quorum calls 
are generally taken by electronic device. Essentially the 
system works as follows: A number of vote stations are 
attached to selected chairs in the Chamber. Each station is 
equipped with a vote card slot and 4 indicators, marked 
"yea", "nay", "present", and "open". The "open" indicator is 
used only when a vote period is in progress and the system is 
ready to accept votes. Each Member is provided with a 
personalized Vote 09ID Card. A Member votes by inserting the 
voting card into any one of the vote stations and depressing 
the appropriate push button to indicate the Member's choice. 
The machine records the votes and reports the result when the 
vote is completed. In the event the Member is without a Vote 
09ID Card, the Member may still vote by handing a paper 
ballot to the Tally Clerk, who may then record the vote 
electronically according to the indicated preference of the 
Member. The paper ballots are green for "yea", red for "nay", 
and amber for "present".<p>

<b> PAIRING OF MEMBERS</b><p>

 When a Member anticipates being unavoidably absent at the 
time a vote is to be taken, the Member may arrange in advance 
to be recorded as being either in favor of, or opposed to, 
the question by being "paired" with a Member who will also be 
absent and who holds contrary views on the question. A 
specific pair of this kind shows how the Member would have 
voted if present. Occasionally, a Member who has arranged in 
advance to be paired, actually is present at the time of 
voting. The Member then votes as if not paired, and 
subsequently withdraws that vote and asks to be marked 
"present" to protect the other Member. This is known as a 
"live pair". If the absence is to continue for several days 
during which a number of different questions are to be voted 
upon the Member may arrange a "general pair". A general pair 
does not indicate how the Member would have voted on the 
question, but merely that the paired Members would not have 
been on the same side of the question.<p>

 Pairs are not counted in determining the vote on the 
question, but, rather, provide an opportunity for absent 
Members to express formally how they would have voted had 
they been present. Pairs are announced by the Clerk of the 
House and are listed in the Congressional Record immediately 
after the names of those Members not voting on the question.<p>

 <b>SYSTEM OF LIGHTS AND BELLS</b><p>

 Because of the large number and the diversity of daily tasks 
that they have to perform it is not practicable for Members 
to be present in the House (or Senate) Chamber at every 
minute that the body is actually sitting. Furthermore, many 
of the routine matters do not require the personal attendance 
of all the Members. A legislative call system (consisting of 
electric lights and bells or buzzers located in various parts 
of the Capitol Building and of the House and Senate Office 
Buildings) alerts Members to certain occurrences in the House 
and Senate Chambers.<p>

 In the House, the Speaker has ordered that the bells and 
lights comprising the system be utilized as follows:<p>

 1 ring and 1 light on the left--Teller vote.<p>

 1 long ring followed by a pause and then 3 rings and 3 
lights on the left--Start or continuation of a notice or 
short quorum call in the Committee of the Whole that will be 
vacated if and when 100 Members appear on the floor. Bells 
are repeated every 5 minutes unless the call is vacated or 
the call is converted into a regular quorum call.<p>

 1 long ring and extinguishing of 3 lights on the left--Short 
or notice quorum call vacated.<p>

 2 rings and 2 lights on the left--Recorded vote, yea-and-nay 
vote or automatic rollcall vote by electronic device or by 
tellers with ballot cards. The bells are repeated 5 minutes 
after the first ring.<p>

 2 rings and 2 lights on the left followed by a pause and 
then 2 more rings--Automatic rollcall vote or yea-and-nay 
vote taken by a call of the roll in the House. The bells are 
repeated when the clerk reaches the R's in the first call of 
the roll.<p>

 2 rings followed by a pause and then 5 rings--First vote 
under Suspension of the Rules or on clustered votes. 2 bells 
are repeated 5 minutes after the first ring. The first vote 
will take 15 minutes with successive votes at intervals of 
not less than 5 minutes. Each successive vote is signaled by 
5 rings.<p>

 3 rings and 3 lights on the left--Regular quorum call in 
either the House or in the Committee of the Whole by 
electronic device or by clerks. The bells are repeated 5 
minutes after the first ring.<p>

 3 rings followed by a pause and then 3 more rings--Regular 
quorum call by a call of the roll. The bells are repeated 
when the Clerk reaches the R's in the first call of the roll.<p>

 3 rings followed by a pause and then 5 more rings--Quorum 
call in the Committee of the Whole that may be followed 
immediately by a five-minute recorded vote.<p>

 4 rings and 4 lights on the left--Adjournment of the House.<p>

 5 rings and 5 lights on the left--Any five-minute vote.<p>

 6 rings and 6 lights on the left--Recess of the House.<p>

 12 rings at 2-second intervals with 6 lights on the left--
Civil Defense Warning.<p>

 The 7th light indicates that the House is in session.<p>

<b> BROADCASTING LIVE COVERAGE OF FLOOR PROCEEDINGS</b><p>

 The rules of the House provide for unedited radio and 
television broadcasting and recording of proceedings on the 
floor of the House. However, the rules prohibit the use of 
these broadcasts and recordings for any political purpose or 
in any commercial advertisement. Likewise, the rules of the 
Senate provide for broadcasting and recording of proceedings 
in the Senate Chamber with similar restrictions.<p>

 
 XII. <a name="budget"><b>CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET PROCESS</b></a><p>

  The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 
l974 provides Congress with a procedure for establishing 
appropriate budget and revenue levels for each year. 
Essentially, the Congressional budget process involves 
"concurrent resolutions on the budget" that are passed each 
year.  These resolutions are designed to coordinate the 
revenue and spending decisions that the various legislative 
committees of Congress make in acting on measures within 
their respective jusrisdictions in order to provide fiscal 
discipline for Congress.<p>

 Congress must complete action on a concurrent resolution on 
the budget for the next fiscal year by April 15. This 
resolution sets levels of new budget authority and spending, 
revenue, and debt levels. However, Congress may adopt a later 
budget resolution that revises or reaffirms the most recently 
adopted budget resolution.<p>

 One of the mechanisms Congress uses to enforce projected 
budget authority and spending, revenue, and debt levels is 
called the reconciliation process. Under reconciliation, 
Congress in a budget resolution directs one or more of the 
legislative committees to determine and recommend changes in 
laws or bills that will achieve the levels set by the budget 
resolution. The directions to the committees specify the 
total amounts that must be changed but leaves to the 
discretion of the committees the changes that must be made to 
achieve the required levels.<p>

 If only one committee has been directed to recommend 
changes, that committee reports its reconciliation 
legislation directly to the floor for consideration by the 
whole House. How ever, if more than one committee has been 
directed to make changes, the committees report the 
recommended changes to the Committee on the Budget. The 
Committee then reports an omnibus reconciliation bill to the 
floor for consideration by the whole House. The Committee may 
not change the reconciliation legislation substantively.<p>

 When changes are to be made in legislation that already has 
been enacted or enrolled (for an explanation of enrollment, 
see Part XVII), the vehicle used is a reconciliation bill 
that is enacted in the same manner as any other bill. 
However, if changes are to be made in bills or resolutions 
that have not been enrolled yet, Congress enacts the changes 
in a concurrent resolution not requiring approval of the 
President. The concurrent resolution directs the Clerk of the 
House or the Secretary of the Senate to make the necessary 
changes in the bill or resolution as directed by the 
reconciliation resolution. Congress must complete action on a 
reconciliation bill or resolution by June 15 of each year.<p>

 Generally, after Congress has completed action on a 
concurrent resolution on the budget for a fiscal year, it is 
not in order to consider legislation that does not conform to 
the budget authority and spending, revenue, and debt levels 
set for that fiscal year.<p>

 In 1985, Congress enacted legislation establishing a 
procedure to gradually reduce the Federal deficit to zero. 
The current target date for a zero deficit is 1993. Under the 
new procedure, if the estimated deficit for a fiscal year 
exceeds the statutory level for that year, across-the-board 
cuts in the Federal budget (with certain exceptions) would go 
into effect automatically pursuant to order of the President.<p>

 
 XIII.<a name="message"><b> ENGROSSMENT AND MESSAGE TO SENATE</b></a><p>

  The preparation of a copy of the bill in the form in which 
it has passed the House is sometimes a detailed and 
complicated process because of the large number and 
complexity of amendments to some bills adopted by the House. 
Frequently these amendments are offered during a spirited 
debate with little or no prior formal preparation. The 
amendment may be for the purpose of inserting new language, 
substituting different words for those set out in the bill, 
or deleting portions of the bill. It is not unusual to have 
more than 100 amendments, including those proposed by the 
committee at the time the bill is reported and those offered 
from the floor during the consideration of the bill in the 
Chamber. Some of the amendments offered from the floor are 
written in longhand and others are typewritten. Each 
amendment must be inserted in precisely the proper place in 
the bill, with the spelling and punctuation exactly the same 
as it was adopted by the House. Obviously, it is extremely 
important that the Senate receive a copy of the bill in the 
precise form in which it has passed the House. The 
preparation of such a copy is the function of the enrolling 
clerk.<p>

 There is an enrolling clerk in each House. In the House, the 
enrolling clerk is under the Clerk of the House. In the 
Senate, the enrolling clerk is under the Secretary of the 
Senate. The enrolling clerk receives all the papers relating 
to the bill, including the official Clerk's copy of the bill 
as reported by the standing committee and each amendment 
adopted by the House. From this material the enrolling clerk 
prepares the engrossed copy of the bill as passed, containing 
all the amendments agreed to by the House. At this point, the 
measureceases technically to be called a bill and is termed 
"an act signifying that it is the act of one body of the 
Congress, although it is still popularly referred to as a 
bill. The engrossed bill is printed on blue paper and a 
certificate that it passed the House of Representatives is 
signed by the Clerk of the House. The engrossed bill is 
delivered by a reading clerk to the Senate, while that body 
is actually sitting, in a rather formal ceremonious manner 
befitting the dignity of both Houses. The reading clerk is 
escorted into the Chamber by the Secretary or another officer 
of the Senate and on being recognized by the Presiding 
Officer of the Senate states that the House has passed the 
bill, giving its number and title, and requests the 
concurrence of the Senate.<p>

 
 XIV. <a name="senate"><b>SENATE ACTION</b></a><p>

  The Presiding Officer of the Senate refers the engrossed 
bill to the appropriate standing committee of the Senate in 
conformity with the rules of the Senate. The bill is 
reprinted immediately and copies are made available in the 
document rooms of both Houses. This printing is known as the 
"Act print" or the "Senate referred print".<p>

 <b>COMMITTEE CONSIDERATION</b><p>

 Senate committees give the bill the same kind of detailed 
consideration as it received in the House, and may report it 
with or without amendment or "table" it. A committee Member 
who wishes to express an individual view, or a group of 
Members who wish to file a minority report, may do so, by 
giving notice, at the time of the approval of the measure, of 
an intention to file supplemental, minority or additional 
views, in which event those views may be filed within 3 days 
with the clerk of the committee and they become a part of the 
report.<p>

 When a committee reports a bill, it is reprinted with the 
committee amendments indicated by showing new matter in 
italics and deleted matter in line-through type. The calendar 
number and report number are indicated on the first and back 
pages, together with the name of the Senator making the 
report. The committee report and any minority or individual 
views accompanying the bill also are printed at the same 
time. Any Senator may enter a motion to discharge a committee 
from further consideration of a bill that it has failed to 
report after what is deemed to be a reasonable time. If the 
motion is agreed to by a majority vote, the committee is 
discharged and the bill is placed on the Calendar of Business 
under the rules of the Senate.<p>

 All committee meetings, including those to conduct hearings, 
must be open to the public. However, a majority of the 
Members of a committee or subcommittee may, after discussion 
in closed session, vote in open session to close a meeting or 
series of meetings on the same subject for no longer than 14 
days if it is determined that the matters to be discussed or 
testimony to be taken will disclose matters necessary to be 
kept secret in the interests of national defense or the 
confidential conduct of the foreign relations of the United 
States; will relate solely to internal committee staff 
management or procedure; will tend to charge an individual

professional standing of an individual, or otherwise to 
expose an individual to public contempt, or will represent a 
clearly unwarranted invasion of the privacy of an individual; 
will disclose law enforcement information that is required to 
be kept secret; will disclose certain information regarding 
certain trade secrets; or may disclose matters required to be 
kept confidential under other provisions of law or Government 
regulation.<p>

 <b>CHAMBER PROCEDURE</b><p>

 The rules of procedure in the Senate differ to a large 
extent from those in the House. The Senate relies heavily on 
the practice of obtaining unanimous consent for actions to be 
taken. For example, at the time that a bill is reported, the 
Senator who is making the report may ask unanimous consent 
for the immediate consideration of the bill. If the bill is 
of a noncontroversial nature and there is no objection, the 
Senate may pass the bill with little or no debate and with 
only a brief explanation of its purpose and effect. Even in 
this instance the bill is subject to amendment by any 
Senator. A simple majority vote is necessary to carry an 
amendment as well as to pass the bill. If there is any 
objection, the report must lie over one day and the bill is 
placed on the calendar.<p>

 Measures reported by standing committees of the Senate may 
not be considered unless the report of that committee has 
been available to Senate Members for at least 2 days 
(excluding Sundays and legal holidays) prior to consideration 
of the measure in the Senate. This requirement, however, may 
be waived by agreement of the majority and minority leaders 
and does not apply in certain emergency situations.<p>

 In the Senate, measures are brought up for consideration by 
a simple unanimous consent request, by a complex unanimous 
consent agreement, by a motion to proceed to the 
consideration of a measure, or by a motion to consider a 
measure on the calendar. A unanimous consent agreement, 
sometimes referred to as a "time agreement", makes the 
consideration of a measure in order and often limits the 
amount of debate that will take place on the measure and 
lists the amendments that will be considered. The offering of 
a unanimous consent request to consider a measure or the 
offering of a motion to proceed to the consideration of a 
measure is reserved, by tradition, to the majority leader.<p>

 Usually a motion to consider a measure on the calendar is 
made only when unanimous consent to consider the measure 
cannot be obtained. There is only one Calendar of Business in 
the Senate, there being no differentiation, as there is in 
the House, between (1) bills raising revenue, general 
appropriation bills, and bills of a public character 
appropriating money or property, and (2) other bills of a 
public character not appropriating money or property.<p>

 The rules of the Senate provide that at the conclusion of 
the morning business for each "legislative day" the Senate 
proceeds to the consideration of the calendar. In the Senate, 
the term "legislative day" means the period of time from when 
the Senate adjourns until the next time the Senate adjourns. 
Because the Senate often "recesses" rather than "adjourns" at 
the end of a daily session, the "legislative day" usually 
does not correspond to the 24-hour period comprising a 
calendar day. Thus, a "legislative day" may cover a long 
period of time--from days to weeks, or even months. Because 
of this and the modern practice of waiving the call of the 
calendar by unanimous consent at the start of a new 
"legislative day", it is rare to have a call of the calendar. 
When the calendar is called, bills that are not objected to 
are taken up in their order, and each Senator is entitled to 
speak once and for 5 minutes only on any question. Objection 
may be interposed at any stage of the proceedings, but on 
motion the Senate may continue consideration after the call 
of the calendar is completed, and the limitations on debate 
then do not apply.<p>

 On any day (other than a Monday that begins a new 
"legislative day"), following the announcement of the close 
of morning business, any Senator obtaining recognition may 
move to take up any bill out of its regular order on the 
calendar. Usually, this is the majority leader. The five-
minute limitation on debate does not apply to the 
consideration of a bill taken up in this manner, and debate 
may continue until the hour when the Presiding Officer of the 
Senate "lays down" the un finished business of the day. At 
that point consideration of the bill is discontinued and the 
measure reverts back to the Calendar of Business and may 
again be called up at another time under the same conditions.<p>

 When a bill has been objected to and passed over on the call 
of the calendar it is not necessarily lost. The majority 
leader, after consulting the majority policy committee of the 
Senate and the minority leadership, determines the time at 
which the bill will be called up for debate. At that time, a 
motion is made to consider the bill. The motion is debatable 
if made after the morning hour.<p>

 Once a Senator is recognized by the Presiding Officer, the 
Senator may speak for as long as the Senator wishes and loses 
the floor only when the Senator yields it or takes certain 
parliamentary actions that forfeit the Senator's right to the 
floor. How ever, a Senator may not speak more than twice on 
any one question in debate on the same legislative day 
without leave of the Senate. Debate ends when a Senator 
yields the floor and no other Senator seeks recognition, or 
when a unanimous consent agreement limiting the time of 
debate is operating.<p>

 On occasion, Senators opposed to a measure may extend debate 
by making lengthy speeches intended to prevent or defeat 
action on the measure. This is the tactic known as 
"filibustering". Debate, however, may be closed if 16 
Senators sign a motion to that effect and the motion is 
carried by three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and 
sworn. Such a motion is voted on without debate on the second 
day after the day it is filed. This procedure is called 
"invoking cloture". In 1986, the Senate amended its rules to 
limit "post-cloture" debate to 30 hours. A Senator may speak 
for not more than one hour and may yield all or a part of 
that time to the majority or minority floor managers of the 
bill under consideration or to the majority or minority 
leader. The Senate may increase the time for "post-cloture" 
debate by a vote of three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen 
and sworn. After the time for debate has expired, the Senate 
may consider certain amendments before voting on the bill.<p>

 While a measure is being considered it is subject to 
amendment and each amendment, including those proposed by the 
committee that reported the bill, is considered separately. 
Generally, there is no requirement that proposed amendments 
be germane to the subject matter of the bill except in the 
case of general appropriation bills. Under the rules, a 
"rider" (an amendment proposing substantive legislation to an 
appropriation bill) is prohibited, but this prohibition may 
be suspended by two-thirds vote on a motion to permit 
consideration of such an amendment on one day's notice in 
writing. Debate on the measure must be germane during the 
first 3 hours after the morning hour unless determined to the 
contrary by unanimous consent or on motion without debate. 
After final action on the amendments the bill is ready for 
engrossment and the third reading, which is usually by title 
only, although if demanded, it must be read in full. The 
Presiding Officer then puts the question on the passage and a 
voice vote (viva voce) is usually taken although a yea-and-
nay vote is in order if demanded by one-fifth of the Senators 
present. A simple majority is necessary for passage. Before 
an amended measure is cleared for its return to the House of 
Representatives (or an unamended measure is cleared for 
enrollment), a Senator who voted with the prevailing side, or 
who abstained from voting, may make a motion within the next 
2 days to reconsider the action. If the measure was passed 
without a recorded vote, any Senator may make the motion to 
reconsider. That motion is usually tabled and its tabling 
constitutes a final determination. If, however, the motion is 
granted, the Senate, by majority vote, may either affirm its 
action, which then becomes final, or reverse it.<p>

 The original engrossed House bill, together with the 
engrossed Senate amendments, if any, is then returned to the 
House with a message stating the action taken by the Senate. 
Where amendments have been made by the Senate the message 
requests that the House concur in them.<p>

 For a more detailed discussion of Senate procedure, see 
Senate Document No. 97-20 of the 97th Congress, second 
session, Enactment of a Law, by Robert B. Dove, then 
Parliamentarian of the Senate.<p>

 
 XV. <a name="final"><b> FINAL ACTION ON AMENDED BILLS</b></a><p>

  On their return to the House the official papers relating 
to the amended measure are placed on the Speaker's table to 
await House action on the Senate amendments. If the 
amendments are of a minor or noncontroversial nature the 
Chairman of the committee that originally reported the bill--
or any Member--may, at the direction of the committee, ask 
unanimous consent to take the bill with the amendments from 
the Speaker's table and agree to the Senate amendments. At 
this point the Clerk reads the title of the bill and the 
Senate amendments. If there is no objection, the amendments 
are then declared to be agreed to, and the bill is ready to 
be enrolled for presentation to the President. Lacking 
unanimous consent, bills that do not require consideration in 
the Committee of the Whole are privileged and may be called 
up from the Speaker's table by motion for immediate 
consideration of the amendments. A simple majority is 
necessary to carry the motion and thereby complete floor 
action on the measure. A Senate amendment to a House bill is 
subject to a point of order that it must first be considered 
in the Committee of the Whole, if, originating in the House, 
it would be subject to that point.<p>

<b> REQUEST FOR A CONFERENCE</b><p>

 If, however, the amendments are substantial or controversial 
the Member may request unanimous consent to take the bill 
with the Senate amendments from the Speaker's table, disagree 
to the amendments and request a conference with the Senate to 
resolve the disagreeing votes of the 2 Houses. If there is 
objection it becomes necessary to obtain a special resolution 
from the Committee on Rules. However, the Speaker may 
recognize a Member for a motion, authorized by the committee 
having jurisdiction over the subject matter of the bill, to 
disagree to the amendments and ask for a conference. If there 
is no objection to the request, or if the motion is carried, 
the Speaker then appoints the managers (as the conferees are 
called) on the part of the House and a message is sent to the 
Senate advising it of the House action. A majority of the 
Members appointed to be managers must have been supporters of 
the House position, as determined by the Speaker. The Speaker 
must name Members primarily responsible for the legislation 
and must include, to the fullest extent feasible, the 
principal proponents of the major provisions of the bill as 
it passed the House. The Speaker usually follows the 
suggestions of the Chairman of the committee in charge of the 
bill in designating the managers on the part of the House 
from among the Members of the committee. The number is fixed 
by the Speaker and majority party representation generally 
reflects the ratio for the full House committee, but may be 
greater on important bills. Representation of both major 
parties is an important attribute of all our parliamentary 
procedures but, in the case of conference committees, it is 
important that the views of the House on the House measure be 
fully repre sented.<p>

 If the Senate agrees to the request for a conference, a 
similar committee is appointed by unanimous consent by the 
Presiding Officer of the Senate. Both political parties may 
be represented on the Senate conference committee also. The 
Senate and House committees need not be the same size.<p>

 The conference committee is sometimes popularly referred to 
as the "Third House of Congress".<p>

 The request for a conference can be made only by the body in 
possession of the official papers. Occasionally the Senate, 
anticipating that the House will not concur in its 
amendments, votes to insist on its amendments and requests a 
conference on passage of the bill prior to returning the bill 
to the House. This practice serves to expedite the matter 
because several days' time may be saved by the designation of 
the Senate conferees before returning the bill to the House. 
The matter of which body requests the conference is not 
without significance because the one asking for the 
conference acts last on the report to be submitted by the  
conferees.<p>

<b> AUTHORITY OF CONFEREES</b><p>

 Although the managers on the part of each House meet 
together as one committee they are in effect 2 separate 
committees, each of which votes separately and acts by a 
majority vote. For this reason the number of managers from 
each House is largely immaterial.<p>

 The conferees are strictly limited in their consideration to 
matters in disagreement between the 2 Houses. Consequently, 
they may not strike out or amend any portion of the bill that 
was not amended by the Senate. Furthermore, they may not 
insert new matter that is not germane to the differences 
between the 2 Houses. Where the Senate amendment revises a 
figure or an amount contained in the bill, the conferees are 
limited to the difference between the 2 numbers and may not 
increase the greater nor decrease the smaller figure. Neither 
House may alone, by instructions, empower its managers to 
make a change in the text to which both Houses have agreed, 
but the managers for both bodies may be given that authority 
by a concurrent resolution adopted by a majority of each 
House.<p>

 When a disagreement to an amendment in the nature of a 
substitute is committed to a conference committee it is in 
order for the managers on the part of the House to propose a 
substitute which is a germane modification of the matter in 
disagreement, but the introduction of language in that 
substitute presenting a specific additional topic, question, 
issue, or proposition not committed to the conference 
committee by either House does not constitute a germane 
modification of the matter in disagreement. Moreover, their 
report may not include matter not committed to the conference 
committee by either House, nor may their report include a 
modification of any specific topic, question, issue, or 
proposition committed to the conference committee by either 
or both Houses if that modification is beyond the scope of 
that specific topic, question, issue, or proposition as 
committed to the conference committee.<p>

 An amendment by the Senate to a general appropriation bill 
which would be in violation of the rules of the House, if the 
amendment had originated in the House, or an amendment by the 
Senate providing for an appropriation on a bill other than a 
general appropriation bill, may not be agreed to by the 
managers on the part of the House, unless a specific 
authority to agree to such an amendment is given first by the 
House by a separate vote on each specific amendment.<p>

<b> MEETINGS AND ACTION OF CONFEREES</b><p>

 The rules of the House require that conference meetings be 
open, unless the House, in open session, determines by a 
rollcall vote of a majority of those Members voting that all 
or part of the meeting will be closed to the public. When the 
report of the conference committee is read in the House, a 
point of order may be made that the conferees failed to 
comply with the House rule referred to in the preceding 
sentence. If the point of order is sustained, the conference 
report is considered rejected by the House and a new 
conference is  requested.<p>

 There are generally 4 forms of recommendations available to 
the conferees when reporting back to their bodies:<p>

 (1) The Senate recede from all (or certain of) its 
amendments.<p>

 (2) The House recede from its disagreement to all (or 
certain of) the Senate amendments and agree thereto.<p>

 (3) The House recede from its disagreement to all (or 
certain of) the Senate amendments and agree thereto with 
amendments.<p>

 (4) The House recede from all (or certain of) its amendments 
to the Senate amendments.<p>

 In many instances the result of the conference is a 
compromise growing out of the third type of recommendation 
available to the conferees. The complete report may, of 
course, be comprised of any one or more of these 
recommendations with respect to the various amendments. 
Occasionally, the conferees find themselves unable to reach 
an agreement with respect to one or more amendments and 
report back a statement of their inability to agree on those 
particular amendments. These may then be acted upon 
separately. This partial disagreement is, of course, not 
practicable where the Senate strikes out all after the 
enacting clause and substitutes its own bill which must be 
considered as a single amendment.<p>

 If they are unable to reach any agreement whatsoever, the 
conferees report that fact to their respective bodies and the 
amendments are in the position they were before the 
conference was requested. New conferees may be appointed in 
either or both Houses. In addition, the Houses may instruct 
the conferees as to the position they are to take.<p>

 After House conferees on any bill or resolution in 
conference between the 2 bodies have been appointed for 20 
calendar days and have failed to make a report, the rules of 
the House provide for a motion of the highest privilege to 
instruct the House conferees or discharge them and appoint 
new conferees. Further, during the last 6 days of a session 
it is a privileged motion to move to discharge, appoint, or 
instruct House conferees after House conferees have been 
appointed 36 hours without having made a report.<p>

<b>CONFERENCE REPORTS</b><p>

 When the conferees, by majority vote of each group, have 
reached complete agreement (or find that they are able to 
agree with respect to some but not all amendments) they make 
their recommendations in a report made in duplicate that must 
be signed by a majority of the conferees appointed by each 
body. The minority portion of the managers have no authority 
to file a statement of minority views in connection with the 
report. The report is required to be printed in both Houses 
and must be accompanied by an explanatory statement prepared 
jointly by the conferees on the part of the House and the 
conferees on the part of the Senate. The statement must be 
sufficiently detailed and explicit to inform Congress as to 
the effect that the amendments or propositions contained in 
the report will have on the measure to which those amendments 
or propositions relate. The engrossed bill and amendments and 
one copy of the report are delivered to the body that is to 
act first on the report; namely, the body that had agreed to 
the conference requested by the other.<p>

 In the Senate, the presentation of the report always is in 
order except when the Journal is being read or a point of 
order or motion to adjourn is pending, or while the Senate is 
voting or ascertaining the presence of a quorum. When the 
report is received, the question of proceeding to the 
consideration of the report, if raised, is immediately voted 
on without debate. The report is not subject to amendment in 
either body and must be accepted or rejected as an entirety. 
If the time for debate on the adoption of the report is 
limited, the time allotted must be equally divided between 
the majority and minority party. If the Senate, acting first, 
does not agree to the report it may by majority vote order it 
recommitted to the conferees. When the Senate agrees to the 
report, its managers are thereby discharged and it then 
delivers the original papers to the House with a message 
advising that body of its action.<p>

 A report that contains any recommendations which go beyond 
the differences between the 2 Houses is subject to a point of 
order in its entirety. Any change in the text as agreed to by 
both Houses renders the report subject to the point of order 
and the matter is before the House de novo.<p>

 The presentation of the report in the House always is in 
order, except when the Journal is being read, while the roll 
is being called, or the House is dividing on any proposition. 
The report is considered in the House and may not be sent to 
the Committee of the Whole on the suggestion that it contains 
matters ordinarily requiring consideration in that Committee. 
The report may not be received by the House if the required 
statement does not accompany it.<p>

 It is, however, not in order to consider either (1) a 
conference report or (2) an amendment (including an amendment 
in the nature of a substitute) proposed by the Senate to a 
measure reported in disagreement between the 2 Houses, by a 
conference report, that the conferees have been unable to 
agree, until the third calendar day (excluding Saturdays, 
Sundays, and legal holidays) after the report and 
accompanying statement have been filed in the House, and 
consideration then is in order only if the report and 
accompanying statement have been printed in the edition of 
the Congressional Record for the day on which the report and 
statement have been filed. However, these provisions do not 
apply during the last 6 days of the session. Nor is it in 
order to consider a conference report or such an amendment 
unless copies of the report and accompanying statement, 
together with the text of the amendment, have been available 
to Members for at least 2 hours before the beginning of 
consideration. However, it is always in order to call up for 
consideration a report from the Committee on Rules only 
making in order the consideration of a conference report or 
such an amendment notwithstanding the requirement that the 
report and text of the amendment be available for at least 2 
hours before the beginning of consideration. The time 
allotted for debate on a conference report or such an 
amendment is divided equally between the majority party and 
the minority party. However, if the majority and minority 
floor managers both are supporters of the conference report, 
one-third of the debate time must be allotted to a Member who 
is opposed to the conference report. If the House does not 
agree to a conference report that the Senate has already 
agreed to, the report may not be recommitted to conference 
because the Senate conferees are discharged when the Senate 
agrees to the report.<p>

 When a conference report is called up before the House 
containing matter which would be in violation of the rules of 
the House with respect to germaneness if the matter had been 
offered as an amendment in the House, and which is contained 
either (1) in a Senate amendment to that measure (including a 
Senate amendment in the nature of a substitute for the text 
of that measure as passed by the House) and accepted by the 
House conferees or agreed to by the conference committee with 
modification or (2) in a substitute agreed to by the 
conference committee, it is in order, at any time after the 
reading of the report is completed or dispensed with and 
before the reading of the statement, to make a point of order 
that nongermane matter, which must be specified in the point 
of order, is contained in the report. It is also in order to 
make a point of order to nongermane Senate matter in the 
conference report that originally appeared in the Senate bill 
but was not included in the House-passed version. If the 
point of order is sustained, it is then in order for the 
Chair to entertain a motion, that is of high privilege, that 
the House reject the nongermane matter covered by the point 
of order. It is in order to debate the motion for 40 minutes, 
one-half of the time to be given to debate in favor of, and 
one-half in opposition to, the motion. Notwithstanding the 
final disposition of a point of order made with respect to 
the report, or of a motion to reject nongermane matter, 
further points of order may be made with respect to the 
report, and further motions may be made to reject other 
nongermane matter in the conference report not covered by any 
previous point of order which has been sustained. If a motion 
to reject has been adopted, after final disposition of all 
points of order and motions to reject, the conference report 
is considered as rejected and the question then pending 
before the House is whether (1) to recede and concur with an 
amendment that consists of that portion of the conference 
report not rejected or (2) to insist on the House amendment 
with respect to nongermane Senate matter that originally 
appeared in the Senate bill but was not included in the 
House-passed version. If all motions to reject are defeated, 
then, after the allocation of time for debate on the 
conference report, it is in order to move the previous 
question on the adoption of the conference report.<p>

 Similar procedures are available in the House when the 
Senate proposes an amendment to a measure that would be in 
violation of the rule against nongermane amendments, and 
thereafter it is (1) reported in disagreement by a committee 
of conference or (2) before the House and the stage of 
disagreement is reached.<p>

 The amendments of the Senate in disagreement may be voted on 
separately and may be adopted by a majority vote after the 
adoption of the conference report itself as though no 
conference had been had with respect to those amendments. The 
Senate may recede from all amendments, or from certain of its 
amendments, insisting on the others with or without a request 
for a conference with respect to them. If the House does not 
accept the amendments insisted on by the Senate the entire 
conference process begins again with respect to them.<p>

<b> CUSTODY OF PAPERS</b><p>

 The custody of the original official papers is important in 
conference procedure because either body may act only when in 
possession of the papers. As indicated above the request for 
a conference may be made only by the body in possession. The 
papers are then transmitted to the body agreeing to the 
conference and by it to the managers of the House that asked 
for the conference. The latter in turn carry the papers with 
them to the conference and at its conclusion turn them over 
to the managers of the House that agreed to the conference. 
The latter deliver them to their own House, that acts first 
on the report and then delivers the papers to the other House 
for final action on the report.<p>

 Each group of conferees, at the conclusion of the 
conference, retains one copy of the report that has been made 
in duplicate, and signed by a majority of the managers of 
each body--the House copy signed first by the House managers 
and the Senate copy signed first by its managers.<p>

 Obviously a bill cannot become a law of the land until it 
has been approved in identical terms by both Houses of the 
Congress. When the bill has finally been approved by both 
Houses all the original papers are transmitted to the 
enrolling clerk of the body in which the bill originated.<p>

 
 XVI. <a name="bill"><b> BILL ORIGINATING IN SENATE</b></a><p>

  The preceding discussion has described the legislative 
process for bills originating in the House. When a bill 
originates in the Senate, this process is reversed. When the 
Senate passes a bill that originated in the Senate, it is 
sent to the House for consideration. The bill is referred to 
the appropriate House committee for consideration. If the 
committee reports the bill to the full House and if the bill 
is passed by the House without amendment, it is ready for 
enrollment. (See Part XVII.) If the House passes an amended 
version of the Senate bill, the bill is returned to the 
Senate for action on the House amendments. The Senate may 
agree to the amendments or request a conference to resolve 
the disagreement over the House amendments.<p>

 
 XVII. <a name="enrollment"><b>ENROLLMENT</b></a><p>

  When the bill has been agreed to in identical form by both 
bodies--either without amendment by the Senate, or by House 
concurrence in the Senate amendments, or by agreement in both 
bodies to the conference report--a copy of the bill is 
enrolled for presentation to the President.<p>

 The preparation of the enrolled bill is a painstaking and 
important task because it must reflect precisely the effect 
of all amendments, either by way of deletion, substitution, 
or addition, agreed to by both bodies. The enrolling clerk of 
the House (with respect to bills originating in the House) 
receives the original engrossed bill, the engrossed Senate 
amendments, the signed conference report, the several 
messages from the Senate, and a notation of the final action 
by the House, for the purpose of preparing the enrolled copy. 
From these the enrolling clerk must prepare meticulously the 
final form of the bill, as it was agreed to by both Houses, 
for presentation to the President. On occasion there have 
been upward of 500 amendments, particularly after a 
conference, each of which must be set out in the enrollment 
exactly as agreed to, and all punctuation must be in accord 
with the action taken.<p>

 The enrolled bill is printed on parchment paper, with a 
certificate on the reverse side of the last page, to be 
signed by the Clerk of the House stating that the bill 
originated in the House of Representatives (or by the 
Secretary of the Senate when the bill has originated in that 
body). It is examined for accuracy by the Committee on House 
Administration (or by the Secretary of the Senate when the 
bill originated in that body). When the Committee is 
satisfied with the accuracy of the bill the Chairman of the 
Committee attaches a slip stating that it finds the bill 
truly enrolled and sends it to the Speaker of the House for 
signature. All bills, regardless of the body in which they 
originated, are signed first by the Speaker and then by the 
Vice President of the United States, who, under the 
Constitution, serves as the President of the Senate. The 
Speaker of the House may sign enrolled bills whether or not 
the House is in session. The President of the Senate may sign 
bills only while the Senate is actually sitting unless 
advance permission is granted to sign during a recess or 
after adjournment. If the Speaker or the President of the 
Senate is unable to sign the bill, it may be signed by the 
authorized presiding officer of the respective House. After 
both signatures are affixed the bill is returned to the 
Committee for the purpose of being presented to the President 
for action under the Constitution.<p>

 
 XVIII. <a name="presidential"><b> PRESIDENTIAL ACTION</b></a><p>

  Article I, Section 7, of the Constitution provides in part 
that--<p>

 Every Bill which shall have passed the House of 
Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it becomes a 
Law, be presented to the President of the United States.<p>

 
 In actual practice a clerk of the Committee on House 
Administration (or the Secretary of the Senate when the bill 
originated in that body) delivers the original enrolled bill 
to an employee at the White House and obtains a receipt, and 
the fact of the delivery is then reported to the House by the 
Chairman of the Committee. Delivery to a White House employee 
has customarily been regarded as presentation to the 
President and as commencing the 10-day Constitutional period 
for Presidential action.<p>

 Copies of the enrolled bill usually are transmitted by the 
White House to the various departments interested in the 
subject matter so that they may advise the President who, of 
course, cannot be personally familiar with every item in 
every bill.<p>

 If the President approves the bill, he signs it and usually 
writes the word "approved" and the date, although the 
Constitution requires only that the President sign it.<p>

 The Supreme Court has stated that undoubtedly the President 
when approving bills may be said to participate in the 
enactment of laws, which the Constitution requires the 
President to execute.<p>

 The bill may become law without the President's signature by 
virtue of the Constitutional provision that if the President 
does not return a bill with objections within 10 days 
(excluding Sundays) after it has been presented to the 
President, it shall be a law in like manner as if the 
President had signed it. However, if Congress by their 
adjournment prevent its return, it does not become law. The 
latter event is what is known as a "pocket veto", that is, 
the bill does not become law even though the President has 
not sent his objections to the Congress.<p>

 Notice of the signing of a bill by the President is sent 
usually by message to the House in which it originated and 
that House informs the other, although this action is not 
necessary to the validity of the act. The action is also 
noted in the Congressional Record.<p>

 A bill becomes law on the date of approval (or passage over 
the President's veto), unless it expressly provides a 
different effective date.<p>

<b> VETO MESSAGE</b><p>

 By the terms of the Constitution, if the President does not 
approve the bill "he shall return it, with his Objections to 
that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter 
the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to 
reconsider it". It is the usual but not invariable rule that 
a bill returned with the President's objections, must be 
voted on at once and when laid before the House the question 
on the passage is considered as pending. A vetoed bill is 
always privileged, and a motion to take it from the table is 
in order at any time.<p>

 The Member in charge moves the previous question which is 
put by the Speaker, as follows: "The question is, Will the 
House on reconsideration agree to pass the bill, the 
objections of the President to the contrary 
notwithstanding?". The Clerk calls the roll and those in 
favor of passing the bill answer "Aye", and those opposed 
"No". If fewer than two-thirds of the Members present 
(constituting a quorum) vote in the affirmative the bill is 
killed, and a message is usually sent to the Senate advising 
that body of the decision that the bill shall not pass. If, 
however, two-thirds vote in the affirmative, the bill is sent 
with the President's objections to the Senate together with a 
message advising it of the action in the House.<p>

 There is a similar procedure in the Senate where again a 
two-thirds affirmative vote is necessary to pass the bill 
over the President's objections. If then passed by the Senate 
the measure becomes the law of the land notwithstanding the 
objections of the President, and it is ready for publication 
as a binding statute.<p>

 
 XIX. <a name="publication"><b> PUBLICATION</b></a><p>

  One of the important steps in the enactment of a valid law 
is the requirement that it shall be made known to the people 
who are to be bound by it. Obviously, there would be no 
justice if the state were to hold its people responsible for 
their conduct before it made known to them the unlawfulness 
of such behavior. That idea is implicit in the Constitutional 
prohibition against enacting ex post facto laws. In practice, 
our laws are published immediately upon their enactment so 
that they may be known to the people.<p>

 If the President approves a bill, or allows it to become law 
without signing it, the original enrolled bill is sent from 
the White House to the Archivist of the United States for 
publication. If a bill is passed by both Houses over the 
objections of the President the body that last overrides the 
veto likewise transmits it. There it is assigned a public law 
number, and paginated for the Statutes at Large volume 
covering that session of Congress. The public and private law 
numbers run in sequence starting anew at the beginning of 
each Congress, and since 1957 are prefixed for ready 
identification by the number of the Congress--that is, the 
first public law of the 101st Congress is designated Public 
Law 101-1 and the first private law of the 101st Congress is 
designated Private Law 101-1. Subsequent laws of this 
Congress also will contain the same prefix designator.<p>

 <b>SLIP LAWS</b><p>

 The first official publication of the statute is in the form 
generally known as the "slip law". In this form, each law is 
published separately as an unbound pamphlet. The heading 
indicates the public or private law number, the date of 
approval, and the bill number. The heading of a slip law for 
a public law also indicates the United States Statutes at 
Large citation. If the statute has been passed over the veto 
of the President, or has become law without the President's 
signature because he did not return it with objections, an 
appropriate statement is inserted in lieu of the usual 
notation of approval.<p>

 The Office of the Federal Register, National Archives and 
Records Administration, which prepares the slip laws, 
provides marginal editorial notes giving the citations to 
laws mentioned in the text and other explanatory details. The 
marginal notes also give the United States Code 
classifications, thus enabling the reader immediately to 
determine where the statute will appear in the Code. Each 
slip law also includes an informative guide to the 
legislative history of the law consisting of the committee 
report number, the name of the committee in each House, as 
well as the date of consideration and passage in each House, 
with a reference to the Congressional Record by volume, year, 
and date. A reference to Presidential statements--relating to 
the approval of a bill (or the veto of a bill when the veto 
was overridden and the bill becomes law)--is included in the 
legislative history in the form of a citation to the Weekly 
Compilation of Presidential Documents.<p>

 Copies of the slip laws are delivered to the document rooms 
of both Houses where they become available to officials and 
the public. They may also be obtained by annual subscription 
or individual purchase from the Superintendent of Documents, 
U.S. Government Printing Office.<p>

 Section 113 of title 1 of the United States Code provides 
that slip laws are competent evidence in all the courts, 
tribunals and public offices of the United States, and of the 
several States.<p>

 <b>STATUTES AT LARGE</b><p>

 For the purpose of providing a permanent collection of the 
laws of each session of Congress, the bound volumes (which 
are called the United States Statutes at Large) are prepared 
by the Office of the Federal Register, National Archives and 
Records Administration. When the latest volume containing the 
laws of the first session of the 101st Congress becomes 
available it will be No. 103 in the series. Each volume 
contains a complete index and a table of contents. From 1956 
through 1976, each volume contained a table of earlier laws 
affected. These tables were cumulated for 1956-1970 and 
supplemented for 1971-1975 in pamphlet form, and discontinued 
in 1976. From 1963 through 1974, each volume also contained a 
most useful table showing the legislative history of each law 
in the volume. This latter table was not included in 
subsequent volumes because, beginning in 1975, the 
legislative histories have appeared at the end of each law. 
There are also extensive marginal notes referring to laws in 
earlier volumes and to earlier and later matters in the same 
volume.<p>

 Under the provisions of a statute originally enacted in 
1895, these volumes are legal evidence of the laws contained 
in them and will be accepted as proof of those laws in any 
court in the United States.<p>

 The Statutes at Large are a chronological arrangement of the 
laws exactly as they have been enacted. There is no attempt 
to arrange the laws according to their subject matter or to 
show the present status of an earlier law that has been 
amended on one or more occasions. That is the function of a 
code of laws.<p>

<b> UNITED STATES CODE</b><p>

 The United States Code contains a consolidation and 
codification of the general and permanent laws of the United 
States arranged according to subject matter under 50 title 
headings, in alphabetical order to a large degree. It sets 
out the current status of the laws, as amended, without 
repeating all the language of the amendatory acts except 
where necessary for that purpose and is declared to be prima 
facie evidence of those laws. Its purpose is to present the 
laws in a concise and usable form without requiring recourse 
to the many volumes of the Statutes at Large containing the 
individual amendments.<p>

 The Code is prepared by the Law Revision Counsel of the 
House of Representatives. New editions are published every 6 
years and cumulative supplements are published after the 
conclusion of each regular session of the Congress.<p>

 Twenty-two of the 50 titles have been revised and enacted 
into positive law, and 2 have been eliminated by 
consolidation with other titles. Titles that have been 
revised and enacted into positive law are legal evidence of 
the law and the courts will receive them as proof of those 
laws. Eventually all the titles will be revised and enacted 
into positive law, and thereafter they will be kept up to 
date by direct amendment.<p>

<H1>The U.S. House of Representatives<BR>
The Legislative Process - Tying it All Together</H1>
<br>
<I>Prepared by U.S. House of Representatives Information Systems.</I>
<HR>
<DL> 
<DD>  "All Legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a
  Senate and House of Representatives."<BR>
  (Article I, Section 1, of the <A HREF="http://www.house.gov/Constitution/Constitution.html">United States Constitution</A>)
</DL>
<P>
The chief function of Congress is the making of laws.  The legislative process comprises a number of steps, and much
information is available from this page concerning the legislation introduced and considered in the 104th Congress.  To
help you understand the information and how it interrelates, a very brief overview of the legislative process within the
House of Representatives is presented below.  There are many aspects and variations of the process which are not
addressed here.  A much more in-depth discussion and presentation of the overall process is available in <A HREF="http://www.house.gov/HOLAM.TXT">How Our Laws Are Made</A>.  Most of the information presented below was excerpted from that Congressional document.
<P>
<BR>
<H3>Forms of Congressional Action</H3>
<P>
The work of Congress is initiated by the introduction of a proposal in one of four principal forms: the bill, the joint
resolution, the concurrent resolution, and the simple resolution.
<P>
<DL>
<DL>
<DT><B>Bills</B>
<DD>  A bill is the form used for most legislation, whether permanent or temporary, general or special, public or
     private.  A bill originating in the House of Representatives is designated by the letters "H.R.",  signifying
     "House of Representatives", followed by a number that it retains throughout all its parliamentary stages.  Bills
     are presented to the President for action when approved in identical form by both the House of Representatives
     and the  Senate.
<DT><B>Joint Resolutions</B>
<DD>   Joint resolutions may originate either in the House of Representatives or in the Senate.  There is little practical
     difference between a bill and a joint resolution.  Both are subject to the same procedure, except for  a joint
     resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution.  On approval of such a resolution by two-thirds of both
     the House and Senate, it is sent directly to the Administrator of General Services for submission to the
     individual states for ratification.  It is not presented to the President for approval.  A joint resolution originating
     in the House of Representatives is designated "H.J.Res." followed by  its individual number.  Joint resolutions
     become law in the same manner as bills.
<DT><B>Concurrent Resolutions</B>
<DD> Matters affecting the operations of both the House of Representatives and Senate are usually initiated by means
     of concurrent resolutions.  A concurrent resolution originating in the House of Representatives is designated
     "H.Con.Res." followed by its individual number.  On approval by both the House of Representatives and
     Senate, they are signed by the Clerk of the House and the Secretary of the Senate.  They are not presented to the
     President for action.
<DT><B>Simple Resolutions</B>
<DD> A matter concerning the operation of either the House of Representatives or Senate alone is initiated by a
     simple resolution.  A resolution affecting the House of Representatives is designated "H.Res." followed by its
     number. They are not presented to the President for action.
<P>
</DL>

</DL>
<P>
<BR>
<H3>Introduction and Referral to Committee</H3>
<P>
Any Member in the House of Representatives may  introduce a bill at any time while the House is in session  by simply
placing it in the "hopper" provided for the purpose at the side of the Clerk's desk in the House Chamber.  The  sponsor's
signature must appear on the bill.  A public bill may have an unlimited number of co-sponsoring Members.  The bill is
assigned its legislative number by the Clerk and referred to the appropriate committee by the Speaker, with the
assistance of the Parliamentarian.  The bill is then printed in its introduced form, which you can  read in <A HREF="gopher://wgate.house.gov:70/7waissrc%3A/USHOUSE_house_bill_text_103rd">Bill Text</A> (
See <A HREF="http://www.house.gov/help/bill_text_help_104.html">Help</A> for searching examples).  If a
bill was introduced today, summary  information about it can be found in <A HREF="gopher://wgate.house.gov:70/7waissrc%3A/USHOUSE_bill_status_today">Bill Status Today</A> (
See <A HREF="http://www.house.gov/help/bills_status_today_help.html">Help</A> for searching examples).
<P>
An important phase of the legislative process is the action taken by committees.  It is during committee action that the
most intense consideration is given to the proposed measures; this is also the time when the people are given their
opportunity to be heard.   Each piece of legislation is referred to the committee that has <A HREF = "http://www.house.gov/under_construction.html">jurisdiction</A> over the area
affected by the measure.
<P>
For more information on this step of the legislative process see <A HREF = "gopher://gopher.house.gov:70/0F-1%3A218%3AE.%20Intro%20and%20Reference%20to%20Cmte">Introduction and Reference to Committee</A> of <A HREF="HOLAM.TXT">How Our Laws Are Made</A>.
<P>
<BR>
<H3>Consideration by Committee</H3>
<P>
<DL>
<DL>
  <DT><B>Public Hearings and Markup Sessions</B>
  <DD>Usually the first step in this process is a public hearing, where the committee members hear witnesses representing various viewpoints on the measure.
    Each committee makes public the date, place and subject of
     any hearing it conducts.  The <A HREF="gopher://gopher.house.gov:70/0F-1%3A942%3ACommittee%20Schedules">Committee Meetings</A> scheduled for today are available along with other <A HREF="http://www.house.gov/Schedule.html">House Schedules </A>.
       Public announcements are also published in the Daily Digest portion of the 
       <A HREF = "gopher://wgate.house.gov:70/7waissrc%3A/USHOUSE_cong_record_103-2">Congressional Record</A>.
<P>
     A <A HREF = "http://www.house.gov/under_construction.html">transcript</A> of the testimony taken at a hearing is made available for inspection in the committee office, and
     frequently the complete transcript is printed and distributed by the committee.
<P>
     After hearings are completed, the bill is considered in a session that is popularly known as the "mark-up"
     session.  Members of the committee study the viewpoints presented in detail.  Amendments may be offered to
     the bill, and the committee members vote to accept or reject these changes.
<P>
     This process can take place at either the subcommittee level or the full committee level, or at both.  Hearings
     and markup sessions are status steps noted in the Legislative Action portion of <A HREF="gopher://wgate.house.gov:70/7waissrc%3A/USHOUSE_bill_status_104th">Bill Status</A>. (
     See <A HREF="http://www.house.gov/help/bill_status_help.html">Help</A> for searching examples).
<P>
  <DT><B>Committee Action</B>
  <DD>At the conclusion of deliberation, a vote of committee or subcommittee Members is taken to determine what
     action to take on the measure.  It can be reported, with or without amendment, or tabled, which means no
     further action on it will occur.  If the committee has approved extensive amendments, they may decide to report
     a new bill incorporating all the amendments.  This is known as a "clean bill," which will have a new number. 
     Votes in committee can be found in <A HREF = "http://www.house.gov/under_construction.html">Committee Votes</A>.
<P>
     If the committee votes to report a bill, the <A HREF = "http://www.house.gov/under_construction.html">Committee Report</A> is written.  This report describes the purpose and
     scope of the measure and the reasons for recommended approval.  House Report numbers are prefixed with
     "H.Rpt." and then a number indicating the Congress (currently 104). 
<P>
</DL></DL>
For more  information on bills and resolutions see <A HREF = "gopher://gopher.house.gov:70/1D-1%3A231%3AF.%20Consideration%20by%20Committee">Consideration by Committee</A> in <A HREF="http://www.house.gov/HOLAM.TXT">How Our Laws Are Made</A>.
<P>
<BR>

<H3>House Floor Consideration</H3>
<P>
<DL>
<DL>
   <DD>Consideration of a measure by the full House can be a simple or very complex operation.   In general a measure
     is ready for consideration by the full House after it has been reported by a committee.  Under certain
     circumstances, it may be brought to the Floor directly.
<P>
   <DD>The consideration of a measure may be governed by a "rule."  A rule is itself a simple resolution, which must
     be passed by the House, that sets out the particulars of debate for a specific bill -- how much time will allowed
     for debate, whether amendments can be offered, and other matters. 
<P>
   <DD>Debate time for a measure is normally divided between proponents and opponents.  Each side yields time to
     those Members who wish to speak on the bill.  When amendments are offered, these are also debated and voted upon.  If the House is in session today, you can see a summary of <A HREF="gopher://gopher.house.gov:70/0F-1%3A947%3ACurrent%20Floor%20Proceedings">Current House Floor Proceedings </A>.
<P>
   <DD>After all debate is concluded and amendments decided upon, the House is ready to vote on final passage.  In
     some cases, a vote to "recommit" the bill to committee is requested.  This is usually an effort by opponents to
     change some portion or table the measure.  If the attempt to recommit fails, a vote on final passage is ordered.
<P>
</DL>
</DL>
<H3>Resolving Differences</H3>
<DL>
<DL>
   <DD>After a measure passes in the House, it goes to the Senate for consideration.  A bill must pass both bodies in
     the same form before it can be presented to the President for signature into law.
<P>
   <DD>If the Senate changes the language of the measure, it must return to the House for concurrence or additional
     changes.  This back-and-forth negotiation may occur on the House floor, with the House accepting or rejecting
     Senate amendments or complete Senate text.  Often a conference committee will be appointed with both House
     and Senate members.  This group will resolve the differences in committee and report the identical measure
     back to both  bodies for a vote.  Conference committees also issue reports outlining the final version of the bill.
<P>
<BR>
</DL>
</DL>

<H3>Final Step</H3>
<DL>
<DL>
   <DD>Votes on final passage, as well as all other votes in the House, may be taken by the electronic voting system
     which registers each individual Member's response.  These votes are referred to as Yea/Nay votes or recorded
     votes, and are available in <A HREF = "http://www.house.gov/under_construction.html">House Votes</A> by Bill number, roll call vote number or words describing the reason
     for the vote.
<P>
   <DD>Votes in the House may also be by voice vote, and no record of individual responses is available.
<P>
   <DD>After a measure has been passed in identical form by both the House and Senate, it is considered "enrolled."  It
     is sent to the President who may sign the measure into law, veto it and return it to Congress, let it become law
     without signature, or at the end of a session, pocket-veto it.

               CODE OF ETHICS FOR GOVERNMENT SERVICE</h2></center>

<P>    Resolved by the House of Representatives {the Senate
       concurring}, That it is the sense of the Congress that the
       following Code of Ethics should be adhered to by all Government
       employees, including officeholders:

                  <h2><center>CODE OF ETHICS FOR GOVERNMENT SERVICE</h2></center>

<P>    <b> Any person in Government service should:

<P>    </b><b>1.</b> Put loyalty to the highest moral principals and to
country above loyalty to Government persons, party, or department.

<P>     <b>2.</b> Uphold the Constitution, laws, and legal regulations of
the United States and of all governments therein and never be a party to
their evasion.

<P>     <b>3.</b> Give a full day's labor for a full day's pay; giving to
the performance of his duties his earnest effort and best thought.

<P>     <b>4.</b> Seek to find and employ more efficient and economical
ways of getting tasks accomplished.

<P>     <b>5.</b> Never discriminate unfairly by the dispensing of special
favors or privileges to anyone, whether for remuneration or not; and
never accept for himself or his family, favors or benefits under
circumstances which might be construed by reasonable persons as
influencing the performance of his governmental duties.

<P>     <b>6.</b> Make no private promises of any kind binding upon the
duties of office, since a Government employee has no private word which
can be binding on public duty.

<P>     <b>7.</b> Engage in no business with the Government, either
directly or indirectly which is inconsistent with the conscientious
performance of his governmental duties.

<P>     <b>8.</b> Never use any information coming to him confidentially
in the performance of governmental duties as a means for making private
profit.

<P>     <b>9.</b> Expose corruption wherever discovered.

<P>    <b>10.</b> Uphold these principles, ever conscious that public
office is a public trust.

<P>    (Passed July 11, 1958.)

<P>
	The Rules of the House of the 103rd Congress would be adopted as the rules for the 104th Congress together with the following amendments:<P>
<P>
	Title I.  CONTRACT WITH AMERICA: A BILL OF ACCOUNTABILITY<P>
<P>
[Note: Each section below in Title I would be under a separate introductory paragraph adopting House Rules from the 103rd Congress as the Rules of the 104th Congress with the additional amendment(s) in the section, thereby permitting a division of the question and separate debate and vote on each of the 8 Contract items.  The 23 items in Title II, on the other hand, would be subject to a single vote.]<P>
<P>
	Sec. 101.  Committee, Subcommittee and Staff Reforms:  Committee staff in the 104th Congress is reduced by at least one-third from comparable levels in the 103rd Congress.  No committee could have more than 5 subcommittees (except Appropriations which could have no more than 13; Government Reform and Oversight, no more than 7; and Transportation and Infrastructure, no more than 6).  Statutory and investigative staff salary authorization levels would be consolidated in a single, 2-year committee expense resolution (except for the Committee on Appropriations).  The distinction between professional and clerical staff would be eliminated while retaining the overall core staff of 30 for each committee (20-majority, 10-minority, or a one-third guarantee to the minority if less than 30).  Committee chairmen would be required to ensure that sufficient staff is made available to each subcommittee to exercise its responsibilities under committee rules, including fair treatment to the minority in subcommittee staffing.  Interim funding authority for House committees, consistent with planned staff reductions, would be provided pending the adoption of the primary expense resolution for 1995-96.<P>

<P>
	Sec. 105.  Committee Sunshine Rules:  Committee meetings, which can now be closed for any reason, could only be closed by majority rollcall vote if disclosure would endanger national security, compromise sensitive law enforcement information, or tend to defame, degrade or incriminate any person. Broadcast coverage of any committee or subcommittee meeting or hearing open to the public would be a right (not requiring a vote of approval as at present).<P>
<P>
	Sec. 106.  Limitations on Tax Increases: (a)  No bill, joint resolution, amendment or conference report carrying an income tax rate increase, could be considered as passed or agreed to unless so determined by a vote of at least three-fifths of the House.

	Sec. 208.  Prohibition on Committee Meetings During House Consideration of Amendments: No committee (except the Committees on Appropriations, Rules, Standards and Ways and Means) could sit while the House is reading a measure for amendment under the five- minute rule without special leave (which shall be granted unless 10 members object), or unless upon the adoption of a motion offered by the majority leader which shall be privileged.

<P>

Non-emergency items could not be reported or offered as amendments to emergency spending bills (except to rescind budget authority or reduce direct spending to pay for the emergency benefits).  Off-setting, deficit neutral amendments could be offered en bloc to any appropriations measure.

Member terms would be increased from three to four and the chairman and ranking minority member could serve a fifth term if they held those positions for only one Congress.  The Speaker (currently the majority leader) and minority leader would serve as ex officio, non-voting members, and may designate a member of their leadership staff to assist them and have access to committee proceedings and materials, as if committee staff, subject to the same security clearance and confidentiality requirements as committee staff.

<center><H2>THE 1996 REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION</CENTER></H2>
<BR>
 Although the Founding Fathers warned against partisan party politics, US political history has taken a different course.  Partisan strife has evolved from the 1790's with the Anti-Federalists vs. the Federalists to the the current day two party division.  National nominating <a href="http://www.rnc.org/convention/history.html">conventions</a> 
have historically been the clearest demonstration and showcase of party politics and they continue to be a staple in American politics even today.  Political conventions, held by numerous parties beginning in the 1820's and 30's, underscored the fervent party politics of the past and created the traditions we witness every fourth summer.  <p>
In 1856, after only two years in existence, the Republican Party held its first nominating national convention in Philadelphia.  Since that time the Republican National Convention has grown from a delegate count of 600 to approximately. 2500 and attracted the interest of the public and media along the way.  This year's GOP faithfuls will arrive in San Diego, CA for the <a href="http://www.rnc.org/convention">1996 Republican National Convention</a> (Aug. 12-15) and, as expected, debate the key issues in the campaign in the hopes of creating a successful winning platform for the nominee.  Come the 15th the balloons will be on the ground, the money will have been spent and the reporters will go home, but the candidate and the platform which depart the San Diego Convention Center victorious will serve as historical reminders of this important political tradition.<p>
The convention, throughout the years, has provided an opportunity to define the GOP, and at times change the course of its ideological direction.	In 1964 the convention nominated arch-conservative Barry Goldwater, and despite his loss in the general election, spearheaded the influx of conservatives into the national political sphere and culture.  This, some say, contributed to the careers of many prominent conservatives and the the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980.  Speeches, of course, are the main centers of attraction at the convention and they have historically done the most to altar the direction of the party.  From Lincoln to Buchanan, the words said at the podium have left an everlasting impression at each convention since 1856. <p>  
The main issues this year center around familiar areas of debate: abortion, taxes, education and  a host of other economic and social concerns.  The question still remains whether a conservative agenda will arise as the dominate ideology in the platform. Recently, conservatives in the GOP have been fighting for a traditional GOP platform, one which is sensitive to the changing times as well as preserving core conservative values.  Only the results of the convention will tell which direction the Republican party is heading.  <p>

<center><h2>On The Job in D.C.</h2></center>

<h5>[ <a href="/townhall/spotlights/interns/7-10-96/">Graphics On</a> ]</h5>






<p><br><b>What To Expect</b><br>
Working in Washington in D.C. as an intern is not glamorous. Interns 
invariably get the jobs that no one else in the office wants; that's why 
they hire interns. Licking postage stamps, sorting diskettes, running 
errands, and other sometimes monotonous activities are par for the 
course.
<table><tr>

</td><td>
<center><h3>Important Mindless Skills To Cultivate</h3>
</center>
<ul>
<li>photo-copying
<li>faxing
<li>delivering messages 
<li>stuffing envelopes
<li>filing
<li>kissing up to the boss
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><i>How the rest of the employees view interns.</i></td></tr></table>

<HR>
<p>Fortunately, there are brief moments of interesting activities 
interspersed between the doldrums. Be careful to not discount activities
that may be beneficial in gaining more responsibility; doing a poor
job on one task does not recommend you to more interesting activities.
Not everyone can make policy decisions or author position papers.
If your job is kind of boring to start just live with it; things will improve.
<p>
The office staff will most likely enjoy having some one around to do the grunt 
work, but do not expect them to invite you out to lunch. Watch and learn are intern 
necessities; on the job training is a fundamental feature of an internship. Make sure 
you pick up skills from co-workers; sometimes there is a much easier process for accomplishing mindless tasks.

<h3>Ten Worst Washinton D.C. <br>Intern Positions</h3>
<ol>
<li>Fry cook for Bill Clinton.
<li>Marion Barry's Pharmacist

<hr>

<p><br>




<b>Caveats</b><br>
<ol>
<li>Be on time- The only thing worse than D.C. traffic in the mornings is D.C. 
traffic in the evenings. Allow a time cushion or face the consequences. 
<li>Dress nicely- Unlike in Seattle, grunge is not regarded as a viable
fashion option in D.C.
<li>Don't whine- Interns willingly enlist in peonage for the summer; 
the bottom rung on the ladder is not the place for grandstanding.
<li>Be respectful- Especially to people who you don't know. It's not always obvious 
who's a big shot. (example: Who in their right mind in 1990 would have thought Slick Willie would become President?)

<blockquote> 
Scandal and corruption in politics has become, unfortunately, something that the public has grown accustomed to.  However, even the numbest and most cynical citizens have been overwhelmed by the criminal activities of the unscrupulous Clinton White House.  From Whitewater, to Travel-Gate, to the recent discovery of the misuse of FBI files, the American public has been witness to a seemingly endless stream of information concerning the illegal escapades of the Clinton administration.<p>  
Because the onslaught of information has been so relentless, so complicated, we here at Town Hall thought it might be useful to present a list of Clinton personnel who have been accused or convicted of wrong doing.  The following is exactly that, with especially bad little monkeys being marked with a banana next to their names.<p>
The information for this spotlight was provided courtesy of <a href="http://dolphin.gulf.net">Washington Weekly</a>, an Internet publication dedicated to presenting both unbiased news and boldly conservative editorials.  Our special thanks go out to them for their help on this project.<center><p>

<H2><CENTER>Internet Law and the Communications Decency Act</CENTER></H2>

<h5>[<a href="/townhall/spotlights/6-13-96/">Graphics On</a>]</h5>



<p>
<blockquote>
The first blow against government control of the Internet was struck on Wednesday, June 12, when a three judge panel in Philadelphia unanimously ruled that the <a href="http://www.seamless.com/rcl/iplaw/decact.html">Communications Decency Act</a> was in violation of the First Amendment.  The case could go to the Supreme Court as soon as next fall, if the Justice Department decides to appeal, and it is clear that this issue will not be decided in any definitive way until it is adjudicated upon by the highest court in the land. 
<p>
The controversy began when the White House signed the <a href="http://www.technologylaw.com/techlaw/act.html">Telecommunications Bill of 1996</a> on February 8 of this year.  Included as an addendum was the Communications Decency Act, sponsored by <a href="http://www.senate.gov/senator/exon.html">Senator Exon</a> (D-Nebraska), which formally restricts "indecent" material transmitted on the Internet.  This material is specifically defined by the Act as "any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, or other communication which is obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent, with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass."  This issue united both sides of congress and passed by an overwhelming majority in both the House and the Senate.  
<p>
However, despite the apparently clear cut nature of the issue in the minds of the members of congress, a number of people were outraged by the passage of the Act.  Internet, free speech, and human rights groups began immediately protesting and filing <a href="http://ruby.ils.unc.edu/~koyam/lawsuit.html">lawsuits</a>.  A number of Internet users altered their Web pages, changing their backgrounds to black, or displaying blue ribbons, as a sign of protest and solidarity.  Congress heard testimony from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/corpinfo/bill-g.htm">Bill Gates</a>, representatives of the <a href="http://www.aclu.org">ACLU</a>, and others, but were unswayed by the arguments against censorship.
<p> 
And that is what this issue is really all about.  Do the citizens of the United States really want the government to intervene on their behalf and protect them from things that they shouldn't see?  The issue is further complicated by the fact that the Act was intended to protect the many children who utilize the Internet daily, and because of the extreme obscenity of the material available on the Internet.  People have been divided along the traditional lines of the First Amendment debate: those who feel the right to free "speech" must be protected above all else, and those who feel that they have a right and a duty to control the disbursement of material which they find to be grossly offensive.  Obviously, this is a complex issue with powerful arguments being made by both sides, but as it stands, those opposing censorship have won the first battle of what looks to be a long and grueling war over the valuable territory of Cyberspace.

<h2>The Minimum Wage and Election-Year Politics</h2>
</center>


<h5>


[ <a href="/townhall/spotlights/6-12-96/">Graphics On</a> ]<p>






</h5>



<P>With House passage of the minimum wage bill (HR 1227) two weeks ago, the Democrats have proven successful in their attempts to find their voice for the upcoming '96 elections.  Although the Democrats had the opportunity to raise the minimum wage when they were in the majority during the first two years of the Clinton presidency, they chose not to.  They knew that the increase does more harm than good for the poor working families they claim to represent.  But now, with the elections a few months away, it is time to play politics by blaming American businesses and gaining favor with voters.  The Democrats have managed to dredge up one of their favorite liberal pet issues in the minimum wage debate.</p>

<p>On May 23, House Republicans stood divided over the minimum wage issue.  As reported by <i>Congressional Quarterly</i>, the final vote was 281-144 for a bill that increases the federal minimum wage from $4.25 to $4.75 an hour effective July 1, and then to $5.15 an hour a year later.  In all, this is a 21% increase in the wage.  Ninety-three Republicans broke ranks with the conservative House leadership to vote with 187 Democrats in agreement with the measure.  The debate on this issue is not over; this week the bill goes to the more deliberative Senate.  Nothing would please the Democrats more than to have this issue alive up until the November elections.</p>

<p>Why does an increase in the minimum wage hurt American workers more than it is intended to help?  Conservatives refer to prominent economic studies which, according to the <a href="/sbsc/">Small Business Survival Committee</a>, continually conclude that increasing the minimum wage has a direct result in the decrease of the number of entry-level employment opportunities.  "The General Accounting Office, the 
<a href="http://www.brook.edu/">Brookings Institution</a>, the Employment Policies Institute Foundation, the Congressional Budget Office and 
various presidential commission's have all reached this universal conclusion," reports the <a href="/sbsc/">Small Business Survival Committee.</a></p>

<p><a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation's</a> Mark Wilson points out several reasons why the "emotionally appealing" arguments for an increase in the minimum wage are misleading.  For one, increasing the wage will raise the price of consumer goods and eliminate over 200,000 entry-level jobs by 1999.  In addition, a higher wage does not help low income households on the whole, when you consider that over one-half of those individuals who earn the minimum wage are teenagers and spouses living in well-to-do families.  What's more, an increased minimum wage fails to help poor working families when, "of the 23.5 million Americans in poor families, just over 2 percent are working and paid $4.25 an hour."</p>  

<p>Conservatives take a different approach toward raising the level of take home pay for all American workers.  That is, getting the government out of the way of small businesses in terms of the excessive taxes, regulations, and mandates which hamper productivity and growth.  Mark Wilson lists items of the conservative policy: "cut payroll taxes . . . cut the capital gains tax . . . balance the budget . . . increase the skills of the future work force . . . increase the skills of the current work force . . . and enact regulatory reform."  These measures remove the burdensome barriers currently faced by small businesses, allowing them to accomplish extraordinary things in contributing to a robust economy.</p>

<H2> Getting an Internship in Washington, DC </H2>
by, Nick Goldstein<br>

<blockquote>





<p>

So you want to be an intern in Washington, DC?  The key to having an enjoyable internship experience is finding one in an area that you are interested in.  A genuine interest in the work of your office will enable you to maintain your sanity while executing many mundane tasks.  In this spotlight, I will give some pointers on why anyone would ever consider interning and how to go about finding a position that you will enjoy.  These are not just tips from a creative mind, but from an intern here at <a href="/townhall/">Town Hall</a>.  This summer marks my third internship experience, so I figure I'm qualified to give advice on this matter.  Looking back, I realize how much I have benefited from my experiences and how little I knew about finding a position when I first got started.  I hope that you will find this information beneficial.

<p>Interning can be an immeasurable benefit to an academic and vocational development.  Whether an internship involving an area related to your academic concentration, or just an interesting diversion, it can give you experience and contacts for future job searches.  At the same time, you will be able to see how the real world works.  Your experience may guide you along your educational trail or abruptly halt it and point you in the opposite direction, but the more you find out about the job market the better off you will be. <p>





While enhancing your education greatly, most internships will hurt you financially.  I would estimate that nearly three out of every four internships are unpaid, particularly in Washington, DC.  And many of the paid positions will not provide enough income to cover your living expenses.  To make matters worse, the internships that are paid are also the most competitive.  Long story short, nobody gets rich interning.  It's an investment in the future; down the road, the financial toll of your internship experience will be rewarded with a well paid job.<p>

There are ways to ease the financial burden.  One of the most popular is to find friends or family in the Washington, DC area.  Not only will your housing expenses disappear, you should be able to mooch numerous meals.  There are also scholarship opportunities out there for those in need; so search them out.  Also, there are many free meal opportunities in the District.  Keep your eyes open for receptions with food.  They're everywhere, just look for them. <p>





If you are willing to put the time in to looking for an internship, there will almost certainly be one that suits your interest.  Washington, DC is ripe with internship opportunities in every field of interest.  The most difficult part is getting started.  I found that searching for what's available was the easiest way to start.  Finding the opportunities that are available will motivate you to put together the necessary paper work.  There are many places to look:

<p> <ul> <li>Who do you know?  Family and friends are often the best sources of internship opportunities.  Figure out who you know and where they work.

<li>There are <a href="http://www.carleton.edu/campus/career/bibliography.html">books</a> which list internship opportunities.  I recommend Peterson's Guide to Internships. 

<li>Keep an eye out for internship opportunities in magazines and newspapers.  Check the classifieds.

<li>Look into the <a href="http://www.american.edu/other.depts/washsem_worldcaps/">American University Internship Program</a> for a summer in Washington, DC.  For a fee, they will help you find a place to work, provide you with housing, and usually you will be able to get course credit.

<li>Go to your career center at school.  Most schools provide some kind of assistance for finding internships.  Be careful not to limit yourself to what your school recommends.  There are many more opportunities available than just what your school will point you towards.

<li>Search the web.  There are numerous sources out there.  I found a few, but this is not a comprehensive list.
<a href="http://www.fga.com/twc/intern.html">The Washington Center</a>, 
<a href="/heritage/intern_program/intern.html">The Heritage Foundation</a>,
<a href="http://www.med.ufl.edu/oihp/students/intern.html">National Council for International Health</a>,
<a href="http://www.tvjobs.com/intern.htm">Radio and Television Internship Opportunities</a>,
<a href="http://www.si.edu/youandsi/ofgfel.htm">The Smithsonian Institution Opportunities</a>,
<a href="http://www.americanexpress.com/student/moneypit/getjob/intern/intern.html">American Express University</a>,
<a href="/discovery/educate.html">The Discovery Institute</a>,
<a href="/conservative/intern.html">American Conservative Union</a>,
<a href="/lead-inst/eps.html">The Leadership Institute</a></ul>

It is essential to apply to several internships that you are interested in, as the competition is fierce, especially in the summer.

<p>Once you have composed a list of internship opportunities that you would like, you are ready to put together the necessary materials.  At the very least you will need a <a href="/townhall/spotlights/interns/6-7-96/resume.html">resume</a> and <a href="/townhall/spotlights/interns/6-7-96/coverltr.html">cover letter</a>.  The key to a good resume and cover letter is to distinguish yourself.  Emphasize any experiences, accomplishments, leadership positions, etc. that will set you apart.  In addition, if you are applying to different types of positions you may want to emphasize different experiences and accomplishments accordingly.

<p>You will often be asked to submit additional information, such as a transcript, writing samples, recommendations, and applications.  Recommendations can be very helpful, depending on who writes them.  This is partly luck, but try to find someone that has a talent for emphasizing and/or creating your special talents.  In a writing sample, look for something that relates to the work of the office you are interested in.  In addition, originality is good.  These people will see many writing samples, make yours stand out.  Keep in mind it doesn't have to be a paper, I found that brochures and advertisements I created for a previous job worked well.  The key is to make your materials as personal as possible.  It is important to give the impression that you are putting a lot of effort into the materials you send.  The process can be time consuming and frustrating.  However, it is definitely worth the effort.

<p>After you have submitted all the necessary materials, you may be contacted for an interview.  Interviews are a nerve-racking experience for most people.  The key is to be yourself.  After all, the purpose of the interview is for your potential employer to get to know you.  At the same time, keep in mind what they want to here.  Do the little things that can impress them.  Pay attention to name, highlight experiences that relate to the work they have described, and anything else that will help.  It may take some practice to figure out what to do.  To get a start, try this <a href="http://www.kaplan.com/career/hotseat/"> practice interview</a>.


<p>Good luck with your internship search.  If you have any questions feel free to <a href="mailto:njg9b@virginia.edu">email </a> me.

<H2>Medicare: The Sequel</H2>
</center>







<h5>[ <a href="/townhall/spotlights/6-4-96/">Graphics On</a> ]</h5>



<blockquote>

<P>On Wednesday, June fifth, the battle over Medicare will begin
anew.  On that day, the Medicare trustees are expected to release
a report showing that Medicare is going broke even faster than
was reported last year.  This means that a solution to the Medicare
dilemma is more urgent than ever.

<P>We are all aware of the bitter fight that occurred last summer
over Medicare.  Led by the <A HREF="http://www.aarp.org">AARP</A>,
the <A HREF="http://www.whitehouse.gov">Clinton Administration</A>
and the <A HREF="http://aflcio.org">AFL-CIO</A>, a media scare-campaign
was conducted, the likes of which had never been seen before.  Recently 
on C-Span, House Speaker <A HREF="http://www.house.gov/mbr_dir/GA06.html">
Newt Gingrich</A> declared that Medicare ads designed to scare 
85-year olds were and are despicable.  And that is just what these
groups tried to do: scare the elderly away from the reform proposals
of the Republicans.

<P>What these great defenders of the elderly neglected to mention was the
fact that when Medicare goes bankrupt, no one will have Medicare.  Instead,
liberals lied atrociously, claiming that a Republican-proposed 6.7% growth
in Medicare per year was actually a draconian cut that would starve the
elderly, and was proposed in order to pay for tax breaks for the rich.  
Eventually, the terror efforts were successful: although Congress succeeded
in passing <A HREF="http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/L?d104:./list/
d104sh.lst:341[341-342](Medicare_Preservation_Act_of_1995">Medicare Reform
</A>, Clinton vetoed it.  Even <A HREF="http://www.washingtonpost.com">The 
Washington Post</A> lamented that nothing would be done to help save the 
entitlement program.

<P>The arguments wont change this time around.  John Sweeney, president of
the AFL-CIO, has already launched a 35 million dollar campaign and a <A HREF=
"http://www.townhall.com/townhall/spotlights/6-3-96">"union summer"</A> 
against Republicans.  Adding Republican support of Medicare Reform to his 
list of complaints would suit him fine.  And the AARP receives so much funding
from the federal government (to the tune of seventy-six million dollars)
that swatting down Republican efforts can be done with what must seem to 
them spare change.  

<P>But we cannot let them win this time.

<P>The reforms that Republicans are proposing would substantially improve
the current Medicare system.  Perhaps most important would be granting 
recipients of Medicare the option of choosing from either private plans or
the government program.  Another important reform would be altering the way
benefits from Medicare are distributed: rather than an open-ended system 
which delivers a certain set of benefits, the new program would send a 
defined amount of money in the form of a voucher to recipients, that they
might spend the money as they chose.  Both of these measures would allow 
for greater consumer choice and, through competition, reduce the costs of 
Medicare without reducing the quality of services provided.

<P>For the sake of both the elderly today and the elderly tomorrow, we cannot
lose this fight. Regardless of the political consequences, be they good or
bad, our politicians are called first to serve this nation: they must ignore
the PAC scare-campaigns and enact solutions to our most important problems.
Caving in on Medicare would be a sign of a nations leaders adrift in 
extraordinary political impotence.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>Big labor is on the move this summer.  On Saturday, June 1, the <a href="http://www.aflcio.org">AFL-CIO</a> is kicking off 
their <a href="http://www.aflcio.org/usummer">"Union Summer"</a> campaign.  The program involves young workers and college students who will organize union campaigns and direct liberal political efforts.  To help workers find their "voice" against "todays profit-crazed corporations," Union Summer 
participants will work in locations around the country to raise support for their cause.</p>  

<p>This activist program represents the labor unions' latest efforts in attacking corporate 
America and feeding misinformation to honest, hard-working Americans.  In the past few 
weeks, the labor unions rolled out an aggressive ad campaign which supported an 
increase in the minimum wage.  The campaign was directed toward House Republicans in 
districts with high union membership.  With the House passage of the minimum wage a 
few weeks ago, these attack ads had a direct impact on the outcome.</p>  

<p>In her article entitled, <a href="http://www.townhall.com/townhall/columnists/schlafly/schl030796.html">"Looking Out for Union Politicking in Congressional Campaigns,"</a> Phyllis Schlafly, president of Eagle Forum, has followed the union tactics and how the AFL-CIO plans to spend $35 million on an ad campaign "to defeat 75 Republican Congressmen in the 1996 November elections."  This amount of money spent on advertising is seven times more than is regularly spent in federal elections.  An <a href="http://www.townhall.com/townhall/columnists/duplantier/dupl032596.html">F.R. Duplantier column</a> provides further insights into the unions heavy investment in ad campaigns for the upcoming elections.</p>     

<p>The good news is that some television stations across the country have either refused to 
air or eventually pulled the advertisements from their rotation, according to the National 
Republican Congressional Committee.  In one instance, on May 25, the Evansville 
Courier reported how the WEVV-44 television station canceled AFL-CIO commercials 
which criticized US Rep. John Hostettler because the ads were false, accusing the 
Congressman "of cutting Medicare and student loans."  Skip Simms, WEVV-44 general 
manager, said, "We felt the statement in the ad was not true, therefore we pulled it.  The 
information the AFL-CIO provided us to support the statement was pretty weak."  Other 
freshman Republican Congressmen who have been on the unions "hit list" include 
Edward Whitfield (KY), Todd Tiahrt (KS), James Longley Jr.(ME), Jon Christensen (NE), and 
Randy Tate (WA).</p>

<p><a href="http://www.townhall.com/sbsc/">The Small Business Survival Committee</a> (SBSC) has written extensively on other tactics and strategies of the labor unions (i.e. Republican attack ads, mismanagement of union 
dues).  The May 23 issue of SBSCs <a href="http://www.townhall.com/sbsc/laborwatch/lw-14.html">Labor Watch</a> covers how the National Education Association (NEA) and the American Federation of Teachers just finished their strategy session, setting a liberal legislative agenda for the 96 elections.  According to Labor Watch, the NEAs tax-and-spend policies would "increase the size of government by nearly 40%; . . . most of the issues on their list have little or nothing to do with education."</p>  

<p>According to <a href="http://www.townhall.com/abb/">Americans for a Balanced Budget</a> (ABB), AFL-CIOs president, John Sweeney, fails to represent his rank-and-file members in the union.  In a <a href="http://www.townhall.com/abb/pr/043096.html">poll Frank Luntz 
conducted for ABB</a>, union members overwhelmingly were in favor of Medical Savings Accounts, a balanced budget, and tax cuts.  Sweeneys blatant disregard for the views of the rank-and-file members illustrates his "leftward views and desire to return the Congress back to Democrat control."<p/>

<p>Whats alarming about Union Summer is that the AFL-CIO is now getting young people involved in their misinformation campaign.  According to AFL-CIO president Sweeney, he will use 1,000 young workers and college students to build the new grassroots campaign by having them "planning, phone calling, door knocking, organizing, and demonstrating."  <a href="http://www.townhall.com/sbsc/laborwatch/lw-11.html">Labor Watch</a> reports their movement will focus on "minimum wage fights at the state and local level, and agitating against the California Civil Rights Institute."  The students involved will work three weeks at a time, receiving "training, free housing, and a stipend of $210 a week."</p>

<html><title>Spotlight on Welfare Reform</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<h2><Center>Welfare Reform in the 104th Congress:<br>Will it happen?</h2>
<hr>
<a href="#welfare">Spotlight on Welfare</a><br></center><P>
During the 1992 campaign, President Clinton promised to reform "welfare as we know it".  So far has failed to live up to his promise.  Will he sign the welfare reform bill into law if the Republican Congress passes it?
<p>
This week, the <b>Town Hall Spotlight</b> will focus on the issue of welfare reform and the welfare bills making their way through Congress.<p>
After an 87-12 affirmative vote in the Senate last week, the welfare reform bill moves to a conference committee where large differences between the two bills must be worked out.  The house bill contains many good provisions to prevent illegitimacy and promote individual responsibility.  The Senate version has been gutted of most of these measures by the liberals so a struggle in conference committee is inevitable.<p>
The looming questions are; will the Republicans be able to come to a consensus on a welfare reform bill, and more importantly, will President Clinton sign it.<P>

<H2>The Great "Train Wreck" on Pennsylvania Avenue:<BR>
The Debate over the 1996 Budget</CENTER></H2>
<HR><center><a href="#Misc">Spotlight on the Budget Battle</a></center>
<P>
If you listen to the rhetoric coming out of Washington D.C. these days, you might think that a natural disaster was bearing down on our nation's capitol.  What is actually happening is quite the opposite.<p>
This Week the <b>Town Hall Spotlight</b> will focus on the issues constituting the budget battle.<P>
As opposed to past years, where the Congress has been irresponsible, the 104th Congress is taking on the tough choices in order to achieve a balanced budget.  Conservatives are in control of the purse-strings and do not plan to let go.  In fact,  Republican leadership has taken a "no-summits" stance in order to avoid the catastrophe that ruined George Bush in 1990.<p>
Because there is little chance of the Congress passing appropriations bills that the President will sign before October, the President must be willing to give in on spending levels or risk a government shut-down. It may sound like a natural disaster to many liberals whose policies are being scrutinized, but conservatives cannot help but enjoy having the upper-hand in the big debate.  When October 1st goes by, Clinton will have to convince the Congress to pass  continuing resolutions in order to keep the federal government working.  As long as the Republicans do not give in,  America will come out of this budget battle having taken the biggest step toward fiscal responsibility in decades.<p>
Throughout the week,  Town Hall will be releasing several spotlights brought to you by the many conservative organizations that make up Town Hall.

<h2>Education: A Conservative Primer <br>
</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
This week Town Hall is pleased to bring you an exclusive spotlight on education in America.  
<p>
Everyone agrees that the success of the tomorrow's Americans is dependant on a good education today; however, the type of education is an ongoing debate between liberals and conservatives.
<p>
No one disagrees that educational progress in the last thirty years is embarrassing.  Low test scores and rankings as compared to other countries, poor discipline in the classroom and violence in school have been the results of liberal ideology on the school system.  Instead of focusing on the immediate purpose of primary education--educating our youth in history, mathematics, social science, and language-- enlightened members of academia have determined that diversity, multicultural curriculum, and self-esteem programs represent the true focus of the American educational experience.  
<p>
What is the solution? Well, in Town Hall's exclusive spotlight this week, you'll discover that leading conservative organizations have developed numerous programs to combat the current state of American education.  Along with raising standards and restoring a sense of order and discipline in the classroom, other policies include school choice, market-based reform, and privatization.  Best of all, these policies are now the central components of the ongoing debate, which is a victory in itself for conservatives.

<H2>What YOU Should Know About the Congress as they Reconvene
to Debate their Fall Agenda</CENTER></H2>
<HR>

<P>
The 104th Congress' Fall session is peeking its head around the
corner and hopefully America is looking. The last full session
of the year has historically been a provider of memorable moments
in our nation's legislature. This year will not disappoint. Issues
such as welfare reform, Medicaid, Medicare, education legislation
and the United States' involvement in the Bosnian civil war will
be discussed until the time the autumn leaves give way to winter
snow.
<P>
In our representative democracy an educated populace is imperative.  The result is a public with
informed, yet differing, opinions. The theory behind a representative democracy
is that citizens, out of their own free will and privilege, vote another citizen to represent them in
our nation's capital. Understanding the political process is essential if we are to hold politicians
accountable. When public opinion coalesces into consensus, legislators take notice.  <p>

The problem is that private citizens are
just that--private. They work, provide for their families, spend
time with their loved ones and raise their children. Many simply don't have the time to acquire,
much less absorb, the mass of information detailing how the system works and impacts their
lives.
<P>
For your convenience, Town Hall has assembled a guide to the 104th Congress and how
legislation becomes law.  Democracy is fragile.  It is absolutely necessary that it be nurtured by
private citizens.  It has never been easier.

<h2>Presidential Candidate Spotlight</h2>
</center>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
February is only a few months away and politicians are once again flocking to New Hampshire in hopes of capturing the all important first primary of the presidential race. Currently there are 9 GOP candidates in the race, all participating in the ideological labeling which takes place before the issues control the campaign.  With nine candidates, it is difficult to remember who they are and what they stand for.<p>
This spotlight summarizes the candidtaes in question and relays a portion of their ideology and stance on the political spectrum.  Biographies and speeches can be found as well as the current <i>Heritage Foundation Policy Review</i> article which relays arguments for each of the candidates. Links to all of the presidential HomePages are also available.<p>
As the sun sets on the presidential race, there will only be one man who will assume power.  Make sure you make an informed decsoin with your vote.  Start here for the information!<p>

<title>TH Spotlight on Leader:  Congressman Dick Armey</title>

<h2><i>TH Spotlight on The Leader</i></h2>
</center>
Some say that true statesmanship is dead in America.  But sometimes there is an exception to the rule.  Whether championing the flat-tax proposal, writing his book, "The Freedom Revolution" or pushing the <i>Contract with America</i> through Congress, Representative Dick Armey is a true leader.  Consistently advancing the ideas of Ronald Reagan -- less government, more freedom, lower taxes and strong families -- Armey is in the vanguard of the "conservative revolution."
<p>
This week's Town Hall Spotlight focuses on the first Republican Majority Leader since 1954.  Town Hall has selected the speeches which get to the core of Armey's philosophy.  Bashing the "arrogant political order," and declaring that now is "not a moment for the timid,"  Armey is paving the way towards a true "Freedom Revolution."  Find out why Empower America's Vin Weber describes him as, "a one-man think tank in cowboy boot."

<br>
<br>
8/7/95
<br>
<br>
	I had a problem this week.  With the Waco and Whitewater Hearings, the tax debate, Medicare negotiations, and Bosnia going on, I couldn't decide what I should write.  After spending a solid 5 minutes thinking, I decided to write about Town Hall's new programming schedule.<p>

	Starting Monday, August 7, Town Hall will implement a new programming schedule.  The first component is entitled the <b>Spotlight</b>. A new one will appear each Monday and will focus on an issue, event, organization, or person.  After reading a Spotlight, you will be able to enter a special Forum where you can debate the issues with other Town Hall users.  (It is still under construction so please use the regular Forum to discuss this week's topic.  Look for the one with the <b> Spotlight/Flat Tax</b> title.  <a href="/townhall/hotissues/welcome.html.cgi"> (Click here to jump to the Forum page</a>) <p>
 <A HREF="/townhall/spotlights/i-flatx.html">This week's Spotlight</A> focuses on tax reform.  The Armey-Shelby flat tax plan, the Archer sales tax plan, and Dick Gephardt's 10 percent tax plan are presented, while <a href="/townhall/atr/1.html">Americans for Tax Reform</a>'s Grover Norquist, <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a>'s Dan Mitchell, and other tax analysts examine the pros and cons of each plan.  Look for a new book from the <a href="/townhall/sbsc">Small Business Survival Committee</a>'s Raymond Keating to be available through the Town Hall shop in the coming weeks.<p>

	Town Hall will begin to expand our programming next week with news summaries, a daily what's new, polls, surveys, games, etc.  Use the <a href="/townhall/cyber_personth/cyberper.htm">Ask Tom</a> link to suggest other information or activities that you would like to see on Town Hall.<p>

	I hope that you enjoy our inaugural Spotlight on Tax Reform!  Don't forget to go to the <a href="/townhall/hotissues/welcome.html.cgi">Forum</a> to let everyone in Town Hall know what you think about the issue.<p>

INTRODUCTION   
<P>
     With the release last month of the final report of the National
Commission to Ensure a Strong Competitive Airline Industry, a verdict
has been entered against government re-regulation and in favor of
economic competition. The way to strengthen the United States airline
industry, the Commission says, is to spur greater flexibility and
international competition in the industry, not to turn back the clock
to regulation.
<P>
     The Airline Commission was created by Congress in 1992 in
response to the financial problems plaguing the airline industry. The
Commission was charged with making policy recommendations about the
"financial health and future competitiveness of the U.S. airline and
aerospace industries."
<P>
     Although there were worries that the Airline Commission would
recommend a government bailout of the industry and a rollback of
airline deregulation, the Commission report avoids these pitfalls and
makes several valuable recommendations that will improve the
efficiency and competitiveness of the U.S. airline industry. Among the
most important recommendations:
<P>
The FAA should be "reinvented" and restructured as an independent
     federal corporate entity, to permit much-needed technological
     modernization of the air traffic control system.
<P>
The current system still suffers from excessive regulation, which
     imposes unneeded costs on the industry. The report recommends a
     new, more objective system of cost-benefit analysis as a basis
     for decisions on regulation, with the use of outside expertise
     and cost impact data from the airline industry early in the
     regulatory process. And total regulatory costs to the industry
     would be constrained within an annual regulatory budget.
<P>
The current international system, based on bilateral national
     agreements, should be entirely renegotiated. The aim of the
     renegotiation should be to further deregulate international
     routes and to make it easier for foreign and U.S. airlines to
     invest jointly in multinational air service. Carriers should be
     free to make business decisions to serve cities internationally
     with many fewer governmental restrictions on landing rights on
     the basis of nationality alone.
<P>
     The bipartisan Airline Commission has firmly rejected calls to
reregulate the airline industry, and it has offered generally sound
proposals to strengthen the industry. Congress and the Administration
would be wise to move ahead swiftly to implement these
recommendations.
<P>

THE GENESIS OF THE COMMISSION
<P>
     With the effects of the 1990-1991 recession lingering into 1992,
the U.S. airline industry experienced severe financial problems. The
airlines suffered heavy losses. Many of the old criticisms of free
markets were raised in favor of renewed government involvement. Cut-
throat competition is unfair or even dangerous, it was said, because
the travelling public is put at risk when airlines must "cut corners"
to make a profit in a highly competitive industry. Moreover, charged
critics, industries with high fixed costs need the stability of
central planning, or regulation, if they are to survive.
<P>
     Although the Airline Commission reached a sensible conclusion
about re-regulation, there should have been no need for a
congressionally mandated, presidentially appointed panel to reach that
conclusion. The 1990-1991 economic downturn affected more sectors of
the economy than air travel; major corporations such as General Motors
and IBM have undergone significant reorganizations without calls for a
presidentially appointed commission. The airlines themselves have
experienced several episodes of significant financial difficulty in
previous recessions -- and the existence of fare and route regulation
before 1978 did not prevent financial losses. In a market economy,
industries often face severe changes. Business planning should be left
to business management and their staff economists, not to ad hoc study
commissions.
<P>
     Congress established the Airline Commission under Section 204 of
the Airport and Airway Safety, Capacity, Noise Improvement and
Intermodal Transportation Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-581). President
Clinton appointed fifteen voting members in 1993. (Heritage Foundation
Visiting Fellow John Robson, a member of the Airline Commission,
discussed the Commission's findings with the author.  This study's
analysis and conclusions, however, are entirely the author's. ) In
addition, five Senators, five Congressmen, and the Chairman of the
President's Council of Economic Advisers served as non-voting members.
The statute instructed the Commission to investigate a comprehensive
range of concerns:<P>

Can the industry continue to provide fast and efficient domestic
transportation?
<P>
How can the financial solvency of carriers be improved and can the
number of bankruptcies be reduced?
<P>
Will the industry be likely to share profits or losses over the next
five years and does it appear that any carriers will go under during
that period?
<P>
Why has there been a declining number of competitors and increased
concentration of market share among the largest carriers?
<P>
Do competitors have enough capital to purchase the equipment required
to continually improve the safety and quality of air travel?
<P>
Can the industry remain competitive globally?
<P>
Can the industry accommodate growing aviation traffic?
<P>
Are airlines providing the highest quality of service at the most
competitive price?
<P>
Can noise be further abated around airports without substantially
damaging the competitive positions of carriers?
<P>
Are there legal impediments to improved competition within the
industry?
<P>
     To be sure, the airline industry has encountered severe financial
problems over the past three years. And the industry saw some
spectacular bankruptcies in the 1980s, including Pan Am, Eastern, and
Continental, due in part to the use of excessive debt financing to
fund rapid growth. Nevertheless, the concern in Congress about the
condition of the airline industry, as illustrated by the findings in
the Airline Commission's authorizing legislation, stands in curious
juxtaposition to the clear benefits that have accrued during the
fifteen years of growth under deregulation. Among these: (John Stoner,
"Commission on Airline Industry Urges Lower Taxes, Streamlining FAA,"
U.S.  Senate Republican Policy Committee Regulation Watch, July 20,
1993.)
<P>
Airline deregulation has created jobs; salaries are higher and fares
     are lower. Airline industry employees numbered 540,412 in 1992,
     up from 330,495 in 1982 (a 64 percent increase). Employment in
     1992 was down slightly from the 1990 record level of 545,809, but
     still far above the number during the era of regulation. Overall,
     industry salaries and wages in 1992 were 5.4 percent higher than
     in 1991, and up 34 percent since 1982 in nominal dollars. Despite
     the record losses between 1990 and 1992, average airline employee
     salaries rose over 4 percent in real terms between 1982 and 1992.
     Since airline deregulation, overall airfares have declined,
     adjusted for inflation.
<P>
More Americans are flying. Air carriers recorded a total of 474.6
     billion revenue passenger miles in 1992, an increase of 6.2
     percent over 1991. Industry forecasts expect gains of between 
     4 percent and 6 percent over 1991.
<P>
Airplane load factors are up. In 1992, the industry's average aircraft
     load factor was 63.8 percent, a new industry record, beating the
     former high mark of 63.2 percent in 1979. Low ticket prices have
     stabilized passenger load factors in a range of 60.3 percent to
     63.8 percent over the past eight years, despite the large number
     of new aircraft placed in service.
<P>
There is increased competition and wider choice for passengers.
     Researchers Steven A. Morrison and Clifford M. Winston, in a
     Brookings Institution paper, note that, "Route selection is
     greater than it was under regulation. Today only 3 percent of
     passengers fly on routes served by only one airline, down from 9
     percent in 1978." ("The Evolution of the Airline Industry" (work
     in progress).)
<P>
     Despite the clear improvement in air service for customers, of
course, there are groups in the industry who are less well off -- a
typical result of tighter competition. Organized labor, in particular,
is in a worse position now than fifteen years ago. John F. Peterpaul,
a commissioner and Vice President for Transportation of the
International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers,
strongly opposed the conclusions of the majority. His dissenting
opinion was published as a 22-page monograph by the IAM&AW. "Airline
industry workers," writes Peterpaul, "should have the right to follow
their work to a company acquiring part or all of the assets of their
former employer.... and new provisions should be enacted to guarantee
that any airline employee who is laid-off at one company has an
enforceable priority for hiring at any other carrier....  The U.S.
government, and specifically the FAA, must take action to maintain
high-skill, high-wage employment in the U.S. and provide jobs for
American mechanics, technicians, and managers.... " (Dissenting
Opinion by Commissioner John F.  Peterpaul to the Report of the
National Commission to Ensure a Strong Competitive Airline Industry,
August 2, 1993.)
<P>
     Some major air carriers, which grew up in a cozy, regulated
environment, have faced wrenching changes. These older airlines
operated for decades with rigid work rules, and thus higher labor
costs than the newer startup airlines, and so have been at a
competitive disadvantage. In an attempt to ease some of these
problems, the Airline Commission recommended several changes in
pension law that would permit more employee ownership and distribution
of shares to employees' retirement plans. Among other advantages,
these measures would help to bring more labor-management flexibility
to some of the airline companies.
<P>

THE COMMISSION REPORT
<P>
     The Airline Commission issued its final report in August.
Unfortunately, most media coverage of the report tended to focus on a
few questions of particular concern to interested groups, such as the
competitive practices of bankrupt airlines. Problems of more general
significance, therefore, were not well spotlighted.
<P>
     The Commission's main proposals:
<P>
1)   Modernizing the Air Traffic Control System
<P>
     The recently announced decision by President Clinton to rehire
former air traffic controllers fired in 1981 for striking illegally
underscores the political nature of an essentially commercial activity
conducted by the government. Significantly, the Commission's first
conclusion is that the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), as a
government agency, is unable to modernize and fully adapt to the
technological needs of air travel. The Commission does not call for
total privatization of the FAA. Instead, it says, "The FAA must be
reinvented." Vice President Al Gore's task force on government
reorganization has embraced this proposal.
<P>
     The FAA is an agency of the U.S. Department of Transportation.
The report calls for the FAA to become instead "an independent federal
corporate entity," with its expenditures and revenues removed from the
federal budget. The new body would be exempt from the rigidities of
government procurement and personnel rules, and maintain accounting
practices "consistent with best practices in the private sector." It
would also be granted the right to raise capital in the manner of a
private firm by issuing long-term bonds.
<P>
     Essentially the Airline Commission makes a distinction between
operating the air traffic control system, which the government does
poorly, and setting standards for safety and national defense needs,
which is a more reasonable role for government. The report tells of
the delays and costs in implementing the Aviation System Capital
Investment Plan, and it notes the startling fact that the U.S.
aviation system has not permitted air traffic control to use the
existing satellite navigation system that is available to ships and
other surface transportation. Integrating this available technology
into air traffic control would vastly improve efficiency and safety,
and eliminate costly delays.
<P>
     One of the difficulties faced by the FAA under its current
structure and governmental budgeting rules is that the Airport and
Airway Trust Fund's budget surplus is used to mask the federal
government's general deficit (in the same way the Social Security
surplus is used), rather than being available to support air travel.
The reason is that the "unified budget" concept forces all government
fiscal operations to share a common bottom line, and so encourages the
reduction of services and capital spending throughout government
whenever other, unrelated agencies have cost overruns. Privatizing, or
"reinventing," the FAA's air traffic control system would solve many
of these problems.
<P>
2)   Reducing the Burden of Regulation
<P>
     While acknowledging the government's role in regulating safety
and establishing standards, the Airline Commission strongly criticizes
the way the FAA has carried out this function. Adopting a more
coherent approach to safety regulation, it says, would produce
sizeable cost savings to the industry and to the public. The
Commission cites several examples of the FAA's over-zealous approach
to regulation -- and abuse of cost-benefit estimates to minimize the
appearance of error. 
<P>
     Despite the industry's favorable safety record, billions of
dollars in new regulatory costs have been imposed on the airlines. The
FAA's $4.5 billion estimate of these costs does not include more than
$4 billion the airlines must spend to phase out older, noisier
aircraft. The real costs faced by industry probably are more than
double that amount. And in addition to the cost of meeting regulatory
mandates, the FAA imposes a paperwork burden on the industry
equivalent to 6,900 employees working full time, over 14 million hours
annually, according to the Office of Management and Budget's Office of
Information and Regulatory Affairs.
<P>
     Safety is an unambiguous concern of most regulations, but the FAA
has done little to assure its mandates actually improve safety or do
it in a cost-effective way. For example, the Department of
Transportation in 1990 began to require a random drug testing rate of
50 percent of all employees. In the three years the program has been
in place, less than one-half of one percent of airline employees have
tested positive. According to analysis conducted for the Air Transport
Association by the Philadelphia-based WEFA Group of econometric
forecasters, the regulatory burden could be reduced by $90 million
over five years without threatening safety by reducing the level of
random testing to 10 percent. ("The Potential Impact of Selected
Airline Tax and Regulatory Changes on the U.S.  Economy," The WEFA
Group, May 1992, p.  E-12.) The Airline Commission recommends dropping
the test rate to 25 percent immediately and dropping it even further
if analysis shows there will be no detrimental effects on safety. The
Department of Transportation has already established a test rate of 25
percent for its own safety-related employees.
<P>
     The FAA's interpretation of its regulatory duty to assure safety
may be overreaching as well. An ongoing labor dispute regarding flight
time limitations for flight attendants, for example, is the subject of
a new regulatory proposal. The FAA has the statutory authority to
establish such limitations when necessary for flight safety. It is
unclear, however, how flight attendant duty scheduling decisions
reduce safety.
<P>
     There is also a serious question whether the FAA performs cost-
benefit studies as a genuine economic inquiry into the wisdom of a
regulation or as a post facto rationale. A wide gap is often found
between cost estimates used by the FAA and those performed by non-
governmental economists. For example, in 1992 the FAA issued
regulations for emergency exits to allow smoother passenger evacuation
in the event of a crash. American Airlines told the Airline Commission
that its costs alone would be $16.6 million due to this rule. The
original proposed rule would have cost the industry more than $32
million to make the change, according to American, and over $1 billion
in lost revenue because of seating modifications. The rule was
modified after strong protests from air carriers, and then the FAA
estimated it would then cost only $4.3 million per year. (Submission
to the National Commission to Ensure a Strong Competitive Airline
Industry, American Airlines, Inc., June 16, 1993, p.  II-3.)
<P>
     The FAA often underestimates the costs that a regulation actually
imposes. Pending requirements for alcohol testing beyond the current
mandate for drug testing, for instance, would require all job
applicants and 50 percent of all current employees to be tested each
year. Although the government claims the cost would be only $66.6
million over ten years, industry estimates suggest the actual costs
would be closer to $1.4 billion over the ten-year period. And when the
FAA issued a rule to increase the restrictions on access to secured
areas of airports, its cost estimate was $168 million. Since the rule
went into effect in 1989, air carriers report they have spent more
than $500 million to comply. Moreover, the rule is still not fully
implemented. The final cost could be up to $1 billion. (Ibid., p. 
I-1.)
<P>
     The Airline Commission cites the FAA's own estimates that more
than $3.5 billion has been added to airline costs since 1984 as a
result of an attempt by regulators to achieve small, incremental
improvements in safety through the imposition of new rules and
procedures, and suggests an inadequate assessment of the gains
relative to the compliance burden. 
<P>
     The Airline Commission recommends an annual regulatory cost
budget, except for emergency safety regulations, to force more careful
consideration by the government of costs and benefits. Such a
budgetary frame of reference would compel regulators to consider the
overall cost picture as they look at individual regulatory issues.
This proposal is innovative and is supplemented by the suggestion that
the FAA be required annually to inform Congress and the Department of
Transportation of the costs of their own proposals.
<P>
3)   Reducing the Tax Burden
<P>
     The Commission report makes the point that financial weakness in
the airline industry is primarily a self-inflicted wound. Although the
1990-1991 recession was a major factor, the report notes the heavy
debt burdens taken on during the long 1983-1989 growth cycle set up
the industry for its current financial weakness. Significantly, the
Commission roundly rejects any notions of government route or price
controls to bolster the balance sheets of air carriers.
<P>
     Nevertheless, the Commission attacks the perverse way in which
federal taxes compound these problems. Taxes can seriously weaken a
capital-intensive industry, such as the airlines. From 1990 to 1992,
the airline industry lost $10 billion, yet paid $670 million in
corporate taxes. "We believe those [tax] provisions violate reasonable
principles of common sense and good public policy," the Commission
concludes. The Alternative Minimum Tax, the ticket tax and cargo
waybill tax, transportation fuel taxes, and a host of other charges
add up to more than $5 billion annually in taxes paid by an industry
that only once in the past quarter century has achieved the average
profit margin for U.S. industry.
<P>
     Just as the FAA's modernization needs have been sacrificed to
other demands in the federal budget, federal tax policy hits
passengers and shippers of air freight disproportionately. As part of
the disastrous 1990 budget agreement, these taxes were increased by 25
percent, yet none of the new revenue was used to modernize or improve
the safety of air travel. Implementing the Airline Commission's
proposal to remove the FAA from the unified budget process would
permit the rollback of these taxes as well, saving passengers,
shippers, and the airlines over $900 million per year.
<P>
4)   Moving Beyond Nationalism in Air Service
<P>
     The international air traffic system, put in place in 1944, now
consists of 1,200 bilateral agreements among governments covering
landing rights and overflight privileges for each other's airlines.
Because these arrangements are not multilateral and regulated by a
regime such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), with
general rules applying to all trading partners, governments commonly
play favorites and abuse the highly structured system. France and
Germany, for instance, currently discriminate against U.S. air
carriers, and the Commission cites studies indicating that passengers
to both Canada and Japan could enjoy a huge expansion in service from
the United States if the bilateral agreement system were changed.
<P>
     The Airline Commission report recommends that the United States
work to create a multinational system both for air services and for
ownership of air carriers. The United States is the largest single
market and has the most efficient air transportation industry. But
under the existing fifty-year-old treaty regime a legal advantage
accrues to the rest of the world in serving the U.S. market, holding
back the generally more efficient U.S. airlines. 
<P>
     The bilateral system tends to exacerbate the perception of a
zero-sum situation, in which every concession a foreign government
might grant for increased service by a U.S. air carrier looks like a
slice of the market taken away from its own air carriers. In truth,
the air service market has demonstrated, through the U.S. domestic
example, the same potential to expand through lower costs and scale
efficiencies as every other kind of service.
<P>
     The Commission suggests negotiating regional multinational
agreements first, then expanding negotiations to a worldwide basis. It
urges the President to appoint an experienced aviation professional to
lead these international negotiations, with the rank of ambassador at
large.
<P>
     Just as important as market access, the Commission recommends a
major change in the rules governing ownership of U.S. airlines.
Specifically, it urges that:

     <UL>The Federal Aviation Act be amended to allow the U.S. to
     negotiate bilateral agreements that permit foreign investors
     to hold up to 49 percent voting equity in U.S. airlines,
     providing those bilateral agreements are liberal and contain
     equivalent opportunities for U.S. airlines; the foreign
     investor is not government-owned; there are reciprocal
     investment rights for U.S. airlines, and the investment will
     advance the national interest and the development of a
     liberal global regime for air services.</UL>
<P>
     Current law limits foreign ownership in domestic airlines to 25
percent of voting stock. Senator John Danforth, the Missouri
Republican, who served as a non-voting member of the Airline
Commission, has introduced a bill (S. 771) similar to the Commission's
proposal. However, the proposal does not go far enough, because there
still would be a cap of 49 percent on the equity share of non-U.S.
citizens. There is no reason for this percentage cap. Foreign
investors are hardly enemy foreign agents and there is no legitimate
reason to limit foreign ownership in airlines any more than the U.S.
limits foreign investment in other industries.
<P>
5)   Declining production of general aviation aircraft.     
<P>
     Whereas sales of small piston-engine airplanes averaged 13,000
per year from 1965 through 1982, product liability insurance costs,
among other factors, have reduced this to barely 500 per year today.
Over 100,000 jobs have been lost in manufacturing, sales, service, and
related industries. The Airline Commission recommends enactment by
Congress of a "statute of repose." This would bar claims against
small-aircraft manufacturers for defective designs on aircraft more
than fifteen years old. Senator Nancy Kassebaum, the Kansas
Republican, has introduced legislation (S. 67) addressing this
concern, among others.
<P>
6)   Airlines in Financial Distress. 
<P>
     The report also calls for the creation of a presidentially
appointed airline financial advisory committee to advise the Secretary
of Transportation when an airline's financial condition poses risks to
the public or to the industry. 
<P>
     While that recommendation may seem sensible or innocuous, there
would be many dangers inherent in a new regulatory panel with special
access to the Secretary of Transportation. In particular, such a body
could become a powerful advocate of re-regulation during periods of
economic recession. (Commissioner John E.  Robson entered a strong
dissent to the proposal for a presidentially appointed financial
advisory board:  "In fact," notes Robson, "it looks dangerously like
what the now-defunct Civil Aeronautics Board used to do back when the
airline industry was regulated.")

     <P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
     The National Commission to Ensure a Strong Competitive Airline
Industry has published an exemplary report that should dispel any
remaining doubts about the wisdom of deregulating the airlines in
1978. If enacted, the proposals to reduce taxes, rationalize the
system of safety regulation, and examine the benefits and costs of
regulation within a budgeted framework will strengthen the financial
condition of the airline industry. Putting the air traffic control
system on a commercial basis, with a normal, private-sector capital
budgeting system, will permit air travel to stay abreast of
communications, navigation, and safety technology -- a most important
responsibility that the FAA demonstrates cannot be done as well as it
should be in the context of the current government bureaucracy.
<P>
     The need to achieve a truly global air service industry is
perhaps the most important conclusion of the Commission, yet at the
same time it recognizes the tremendous obstacles that would have to be
overcome to attain that goal. Encouraging private, multinational
ownership of a few dozen globe-spanning airline corporations, in place
of today's politically dominated structure is a subtle and wise step.
Cross ownership may represent a "people-to-people" strategy that can
break down political rigidities and protectionism.
<P>
     Congress and the Clinton Administration should take the
Commission's recommendations to heart. If they are implemented, the
U.S. airline industry can look forward to a more profitable future,
and passengers will enjoy even better and more economical travel.<P>

<hr><h2>Drivers Could Get Speedy Win in Congress</h2>
<br>By<br> <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Dr. Edwin J. Feulner</a></center><hr>
<p>
	Congress may soon liberate millions of American drivers who are tired of creeping along at 55 mph on roads designed for 65 mph or more.
	<p>Despite continued whining by self-appointed &quot;safety advocates&quot; that higher speeds will increase the carnage on U.S. highways, a measure already has passed the Senate to repeal the National Maximum Speed Limit (NMSL), a bureaucratic nightmare that for years has made it illegal for drivers to exceed the &quot;double nickel&quot;, or 55 mph, anywhere in the country. 
<p>	The law, passed in 1974, deprived states of their historic right to set speed limits within their own borders, based on their particular needs and conditions. Especially upset were drivers in Nevada, which for years had no posted speed limit, and other Western states with thousands of miles of lonely roads connecting sparsely populated areas.
<p>	Hailed as a fuel-saving measure during the Carter administration's &quot;energy crisis,&quot; the double nickel should have died when President Reagan deregulated the energy industry in 1981 and the long lines disappeared at U.S. service stations.
<p>	Faced with the loss of some of their powers, federal transportation bureaucrats changed tactics and decided that NMSL was really a highway safety measure. So Congress kept the double nickel. In the years following, America's drivers voted with their feet and made the double nickel one of the most widely ignored federal laws ever enacted.
<p>	Bowing to public demand, Congress grudgingly decided in 1987 to let states raise the limit to 65 mph  but only on rural interstates. Thousands more people would die because of the higher speed limit, the &quot;safety advocates&quot; predicted.
<p>	Today, as Congress considers repealing NMSL, we hear the same dire predictions. Richard Martinez, President Clinton's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration head, claims the double nickel saves lives, while Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety's Jacqueline Gillan predicts &quot;more than 5,000 additional deaths and millions more injuries on our highways.&quot;
<p>	Gillan's widely reported prediction shows how hocus-pocus statistics can be used to create unjustified public fears in order to protect the power and turf of entrenched Washington bureaucrats.
<p>	In fact, fewer people died on rural interstates after 1987 than before, according to Charles Lave, chairman of the University of California's economics department, in a study for the American Automobile Association's Traffic Safety Foundation and the University of California Transportation Center.
<p>	Adds Jim Baxter, president of the National Motorists Association: &quot;If you look at the 65 mph highways now, there are about 2,500 fatalities on them each year. There were about 2,700 each year before 65 mph. What Gillan is suggesting is that we will have a doubling or tripling of fatalities on those highways. That's just not going to happen.&quot;
<p>	Baxter cites a 1992 study for the U.S. Department of Transportation that found the accident rate went up 5.4 percent in places where speed limits were lowered and fell 6.7 percent where they were raised. &quot;We expect improved safety, not diminished safety&quot; if states set speed limits, he says.
<p>	If the House and Senate agree on repealing NMSL  and it is not vetoed by President Clinton  some states undoubtedly will raise their speed limits. Other states won't. In both cases, America's drivers will, for the first time in 20 years, be able to watch the road ahead for safety traps instead of radar traps.

INTRODUCTION

<P>     Reacting to America's alleged excessive dependence on Middle
East oil and to last fall's gasoline price increases, Congress is
considering raising the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE)
standards, which mandate average minimum miles per gallon (mpg) for
the fleet of automobiles sold in America by each manufacturer. The
"Motor Vehicle Fuel Efficiency Act" (S. 279), introduced by Senator
Richard Bryan, the Nevada Democrat, would increase the current 27.5
mpg standard to approximately 34 mpg by 1996 and approximately 40 mpg
by 2001. (See News from the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science
and Transportation, 102nd Cong., 1st Sess., March 19, 1991, p. 2. The
bill would require each manufacturer to raise its own fleets' mpg
averages to 20 percent by 1996, and then 40 percent by 1996, over the
levels actually achieved in the 1988 model year. Since different
manufacturers had different fleet averages in 1988, the law no longer
would apply the same standards to all manufacturers after 1996; some
would have to increase their fleet averages more than others.)

<P>     Supporters maintain that this increase is necessary to reduce
America's fuel consumption. The recent fall in oil prices, however,
removes a major reason given for higher CAFE standards. In any case,
to meet higher CAFE standards American manufacturers will be forced to
produce more smaller, lighter and therefore less safe cars. As it is,
the current CAFE standards result in as many as 3,900 additional
highway deaths per model-year fleet. The higher CAFE standards sought
by the Bryan bill would force Americans truly to pay in blood,
increasing the number of highway deaths attributable to CAFE by as
much as 8,600 per model-year fleet.

 <P>    Thousands Out of Jobs. Nearly as bad is what the Bryan bill will
do to American auto workers. To meet the Bryan CAFE standards and
compete with foreign automakers, American manufacturers will have to
transfer operations from the United States to overseas plants. This
will throw tens of thousands of American automakers out of their jobs.
Next will come American workers supplying steel and auto parts who too
would find themselves on the unemployment line.

<P>     Consumer Choice. Because the CAFE law looks only at average fuel
economy, with the averages based on the number of cars sold, American
automobile manufacturers actually can be penalized for producing more
fuel-efficient cars. As American firms have produced more fuel-
efficient mid-sized and large cars, many consumers have switched to
these vehicles from smaller models. But given the peculiar way in
which CAFE compliance is measured, such consumer choices can lower the
fleet average for American manufacturers, even if the mpg for every
individual model goes up.

<P>     The Bryan bill would not greatly reduce American fuel
consumption or America's alleged dependence on foreign oil. It would
not be effective at reducing pollution or at inducing Americans to
drive less.

<P>     If energy prices rise and stay high, this itself will give
consumers an incentive to purchase more fuel-efficient cars and give
auto manufacturers an incentive to produce such vehicles. If fuel
prices remain low, however, it does not make sense to force American
manufacturers to produce cars that consumers do not need or want. If
consumers decide they would rather have larger and hence safer cars,
even if these cars get fewer miles per gallon of gasoline,
manufacturers should not be prevented from selling these cars. The
tradeoff between the safety of a vehicle and its fuel efficiency
properly is the choice of each individual American, not the choice of
Congress.
<P>
ORIGINS OF CAFE
<P>
     The 1973 Arab oil embargo and the ensuing quadrupling of oil
prices by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)
prompted Congress to enact the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE)
program in 1975 as part of America's Energy Policy and Conservation
Act. The aim of this program was to reduce the consumption of gasoline
and thus the need for oil imports. Beginning with the 1978 auto model
year, the program required all auto manufacturers to maintain certain
minimum fuel economy averages for their fleets of vehicles sold in the
U.S. The standard for passenger cars was set initially at 18 miles per
gallon in 1978, but since has risen to the current 27.5 mpg.

 <P>    The CAFE standards apply to any manufacturer, domestic or
foreign, that sells over 10,000 cars per year in America. These
manufacturers must satisfy CAFE requirements for each of several
vehicle categories. For instance, vehicles manufactured abroad are
considered separately from those manufactured in the U.S. Thus, a
manufacturer with a 30 mpg average for its combined output of foreign
and domestically produced passenger automobiles nonetheless would fall
short of CAFE requirements if its domestically built passenger cars
taken separately averaged only 25 mpg. The standards are the same for
foreign and domestic fleets, but different standards apply to
different types of vehicles. A lower mpg level is required for light
trucks, for example, whether foreign or domestically produced, than
for passenger vehicles.

<P>   The mpg performance of each model vehicle is calculated from the
combined average of city and highway mileage, according to tests
conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency. If a manufacturer's
average for a particular fleet falls below the mandated levels, a
penalty is imposed amounting to $5 per vehicle for each one-tenth of a
mpg by which the fleet average falls below the required CAFE level.
Significantly, the penalty applies to all cars sold in the fleet in
question, not just the particular models that bring the average below
the minimum level. Thus if a manufacturer produced one million cars
per year and its fleet CAFE average was 27.4 mpg instead of 27.5 mpg,
it would pay a fine of $5 million to the federal government. The Bryan
bill would increase these penalties. Beginning with the 1996 model
year it would: 1) index fines for inflation, and 2) double the fine
for any manufacturer that failed to meet the applicable standard by
one-half mile per gallon or more three years in a row.

<P>     It is questionable whether the 1970s CAFE standards did much to
increase the fuel efficiency of American cars. What actually did boost
mileage per gallon for American-made cars was the searing competition
from the high mileage imports and the sustained high gasoline prices.
In response to this, American manufacturers invested $88 billion to
make their vehicles more fuel-efficient. (Milton R. Copulos, "Why Auto
Mileage Rules Should Be Relaxed," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No.
426, April 23, 1985, p. 3.) As oil prices dropped in the 1980s, the
rate of fuel efficiency gain slowed. The reason: more Americans
preferred larger cars. 
<P>
CAFE KILLS

 <P>   While conservation of fuel is valued by proponents of higher
CAFE standards, they usually ignore what is more important: human
life. The evidence now is overwhelming that CAFE kills. The reason is
simple. The easiest way to increase a vehicle's fuel efficiency, and
beyond a certain point the only way, is to reduce the vehicle's weight
by reducing its size and its steel content. While technological
improvements in engines or body design also contribute to increased
fuel efficiency, there are limits to what technology alone can do. In
fact, other federal regulations often limit such improvements.
Controls on auto emissions, for example, have forced changes in engine
and exhaust system design that reduce gas mileage. (Thomas Gale Moore,
"The Unresolved Conflict Between Auto Safety and Fuel Efficiency,"
Journal of Regulation and Social Costs, Vol. 1, No. 1 (September
1990), p. 72.) 

<P>     Light-weight Cars. As such, reducing auto weight is the main
means by which CAFE standards have been met. The weight of the average
American automobile has been reduced 23 percent since 1974. (Robert W.
Crandall and John D. Graham, "The Effect of Fuel Economy Standards on
Automobile Safety," Journal of Law and Economics, Vol. XXXII (April
1989), p. 101.) Cars over 4,000 pounds accounted for about one-quarter
of all cars sold during the 1978 model year; they constitute only one
percent of the cars built since 1984. Cars of more than 3,500 pounds
made up over 70 percent of the 1978 fleet, but were only 36 percent of
the 1987 fleet. (R.M. Heavenrich, et al., "Light-Duty Automotive Fuel
Economy and Technology Trends Through 1987," Society of Automotive
Engineers, Inc., Technical Papers Series, May 1987, p. 12.)

<P>     While some car weight reduction would have occurred without
CAFE, the standards have had a significant effect in recent years.
According to a study by economists Robert Crandall of the Brookings
Institution and John Graham of the Harvard School of Public Health,
the average weight of passenger automobiles for the 1989 model year is
about 500 pounds less than it would have been without CAFE
regulations. (Crandall and Graham, op. cit., pp. 100-110.) Raising the
CAFE standard still further will force additional weight reductions,
especially since many of the technological improvements that can
increase fuel economy have already been made. 

<P>     This decline in vehicle weight reduces safety. Crandall and
Graham explain that "the negative relationship between weight and
occupant fatality risk is one of the most secure findings in the
safety literature." (Ibid., p. 110.) Today's cars have less steel in
their frames and bodies to absorb the force of a collision.
Furthermore, with their narrower wheelbases they are more prone to
turn over in an accident. The result: More accidents each year produce
major injuries and deaths. 

<P>     Increasing Fatalities. Crandall and Graham estimate that the
500-pound decrease in vehicle weight caused by the current CAFE
standard of 27.5 mpg already has increased the number of occupant
fatalities that will occur over the life of each model year's cars
between 14 percent and 27 percent. This amounts to between 2,200 and
3,900 additional deaths per model year, spread out over the lifetime
of the vehicles. Crandall and Graham also estimate that an additional
11,000 to 19,500 serious injuries are likely to occur over the life of
each model year's cars because of the current CAFE standards. (Ibid.,
pp. 111-116.)

 <P>    These additional deaths and injuries already are occurring
because of the existing CAFE standards. Raising the standards further
will add to the CAFE death and injury toll. Based on his study with
Graham, Crandall estimates that the substantial weight and steel-
content reductions that would be needed to achieve a fleet-wide
average of 40 mpg would raise the CAFE death toll to between 4,800 and
8,600 deaths per model year fleet. (See testimony of Competitive
Enterprise Institute and Consumer Alert (Sam Kazman) before the
Subcommittee on Water, Power, and Offshore Energy Resources of the
House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, 101st Cong., 2nd
Sess., September 11, 1990, p. 4.)

 <P>    Penalizing Safety. Some defenders of CAFE argue that these
weight reductions can be offset by other safety measures such as air
bags. Yet while a small car with an air bag might be safer than such a
car without one, it still will not be as safe as a large car with an
air bag. The weight reductions necessitated by CAFE tend to neutralize
the benefits from air bags and other safety measures. By one estimate,
adding air bags to a car is equivalent, from a safety standpoint, to
increasing the car's weight by about 385 pounds. (Leonard Evans,
"Passive Compared to Active Approaches to Reducing Occupant
Fatalities," General Motors Research Laboratories, March 1989, p. 7.)
Yet CAFE has led to average vehicle weight reductions of about 500
pounds. Moreover, air bags, anti-lock brakes, improved bumpers, and
other safety features also increase vehicle weight and hence also
reduce fuel economy. Higher CAFE standards would punish auto makers
for introducing similar lifesaving improvements in the future if the
improvements would make cars heavier.

<P>     The Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration (NHTSA) has conducted several studies that
confirm a significant relationship between vehicle size and the
incidence of death or serious injury. (Two such studies are reported
together in Effect of Car Size on Fatality and Injury Risk in
Single-Vehicle Crashes U.S. Department of Transportation, National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration, August 1990.) NHTSA
Administrator Jerry Curry, Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner,
and Energy Secretary James Watkins on safety grounds have criticized
proposals to raise CAFE standards further. Watkins has called Bryan's
bill the "Highway Death Act of 1991."

 <P>    Even self-proclaimed consumer advocate Ralph Nader's Center for
Auto Safety in 1972 observed that "Small size and light weight impose
inherent limitations on the degree of safety that can be built into a
vehicle." (Center for Auto Safety, The Nader Report: Small -- on
Safety (New York: Grossman Publishers, 1972), p. 87.) Nader, who does
not own a car himself but is an ardent supporter of the Bryan bill,
conceded in an interview in 1989 that "larger cars are safer" because
"there is more bulk to protect the occupant." (Rebecca E. Greer, "Be
Safer in the 90's: New Warnings from Ralph Nader," Woman's Day,
October 24, 1989, p. 32.) 
<P>
CAFE COSTS AMERICAN JOBS
<P>
     The CAFE standards already have cost over 200,000 American jobs.
CAFE will cost more if the Bryan bill becomes law. By making new cars
more expensive, CAFE reduces the demand for new cars. Studies indicate
that a 10 percent increase in the price of large cars decreases their
demand by 30 percent. (See Andrew N. Kleit, The Impact of Automobile
Fuel Economy Standards, Federal Trade Commission Working Paper No. 160
(February 1988), Technical Appendix, p. 3.) New car sales thus would
slide, and along with them the jobs of American autoworkers. More jobs
would be destroyed by the shift to those small cars that meet Bryan
CAFE levels, since small cars require less labor per car built than
large cars.

 <P>    Shifting Production Overseas. Higher CAFE standards, moreover,
would prompt American manufacturers to shift their large car
production overseas, cutting their U.S. payroll and employing more
foreign workers. This is because the CAFE law divides each
manufacturer's production into two separate fleets, domestic-made and
foreign-made, with each fleet required to meet the CAFE requirements
independently. Because U.S. manufacturers already build many of their
smaller cars overseas, it is even more difficult for them to meet the
CAFE requirements with their domestic fleets. By moving some of their
large car production abroad, they would be able to offset the lower
fuel economy of their larger cars with the higher fuel economy of
their smaller and lighter foreign cars. At the same time, moving
production of larger cars abroad would raise the average fuel economy
of their domestic fleet. 

<P>     In a similar fashion, CAFE also forces foreign auto
manufacturers with American assembly plants to purchase parts from
abroad. To be classified as a foreign car, at least 70 percent of the
total price of a vehicle must consist of value added outside the U.S.
Since their American-built cars tend to be larger and incapable of
meeting CAFE standards by themselves, these manufacturers have to keep
their U.S.-built cars classified as foreign for CAFE purposes.

<P>     Then, by reducing domestic auto production of U.S. and foreign
auto companies, CAFE eliminates jobs in industries that supply the
auto industry. The impact of higher CAFE standards on the steel
industry would be especially pronounced since reducing the steel
content of cars is the easiest way to increase fuel economy. 
<P>
CAFE PENALIZES EFFICIENCY

<P>     CAFE is not calculated on the basis of fuel efficiency
improvements model-by-model, but rather on the average efficiency of
all autos sold. (The averaging method currently used by the EPA counts
low-mpg cars more heavily than high-mpg cars, making it even harder
for manufacturers to achieve their fleet-wide targets. Thus, if two
cars are sold, one of which gets 20 miles per gallon and the other 40
miles per gallon, the average for the two is not 30 under the EPA
method but 26.7 See Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, Status
Report, Vol. 25, No. 8 (September 8, 1990) p. 5.) As a result, changes
in customer choices can place a manufacturer in violation of the CAFE
standards even though every car in its fleet may be more fuel-
efficient than the year before. 

<P>     Because auto makers have increased significantly the fuel
economy of their larger cars over the past decade, and because oil and
gasoline prices have fallen sharply during the same period, more
Americans are again buying larger, safer cars. And yet, although
automobiles of all sizes are more fuel-efficient now than they were in
the past, this shift in consumer demand from smaller to larger cars
brings down the fleet average mpg of American manufacturers. Thus,
because the CAFE formula takes the ability to comply out of the hands
of the manufacturers, the CAFE standards can actually have the
perverse effect of penalizing American auto manufacturers for the
efficiency gains they have made in the past.

<P>     Bizarre Situation. American auto manufacturers are in the
bizarre situation of having to protect themselves against the wishes
of their own customers. If a manufacturer allows its customers to buy
too many efficient but large cars, the manufacturer will end up in
violation of the CAFE standards. To prevent this, auto makers change
the "mix" of cars they sell by increasing the prices of larger cars
and lowering the prices of smaller cars. (For evidence that automakers
actually do this, see, e.g., Competitive Enterprise Institute v.
NHTSA, 901 F.2d 107, 124-25 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (Ginsburg, J.,
concurring).) In effect, CAFE acts as a tax on larger, safer cars
which is used to subsidize sales of smaller, higher-mpg, but less safe
cars. 

<P>  This skewed pricing system imposes burdens on consumers because
it limits their ability to purchase the cars of their choice. As a
result, many legitimate desires or needs of consumers can go
unfulfilled. Large families, for example, may need a large car. Older
citizens often prefer larger cars because they are easier to enter and
exit. CAFE standards make it more expensive for these buyers to
exercise their choices. In this way, CAFE and the Bryan bill penalize
large families and the elderly.

<P>  Recreational users also would suffer from an increase in CAFE
standards. This is because reducing engine horsepower can increase
fuel economy. And yet, large engines are needed for trailer hauling,
off-road driving, and other recreational uses. (Engine power can
sometimes be a safety factor as well. Some minimum degree of engine
power is needed to be able to accelerate quickly enough to get out of
the way of oncoming traffic and to get across railroad intersections
quickly and safely. See, e.g. Center for Auto Safety, op. cit., p.
73.)
<P>
CAFE IS UNNECESSARY FOR ENERGY CONSERVATION

<P>  The average fuel economy average of new cars sold in America has
risen substantially, from about 20 mpg in 1978, when CAFE first took
effect, to about 28 mpg in 1987. (James L. Gattuso and Kent Jeffreys,
"The Mounting Dangers of the 'CAFE' Mileage Standards," Heritage
Foundation Backgrounder No. 676, October 13, 1988, p. 4.) CAFE
supporters point to this as evidence of CAFE's success. In truth, CAFE
had little to do with this dramatic improvement. The evidence shows
that fuel economy rose as the market responded to high fuel prices.

<P>  Indeed, the average fuel efficiency of cars driven in America
began to increase before CAFE standards were enacted. In the four
years before CAFE took effect, new car fuel efficiency rose 40
percent. (Ibid.) When gasoline prices climbed from 36 cents per gallon
of regular leaded gasoline in 1972 to 53 cents per gallon in 1974,
(U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information Administration, Annual
Energy Review 1987, p. 145.) consumers began to demand more efficient
automobiles. No federal regulation was needed to tell auto makers to
improve fuel economy -- the market was sending an unmistakable signal.
Thus when CAFE went into effect in 1978, its mandated 18 mpg standard
was below the average at the time of almost 20 mpg. (Gattuso and
Jeffreys, op. cit., p. 4.)

<P>  From 1978 through 1982 new car mpg averages improved by another
35 percent (Ibid.) as the average price of leaded gasoline reached a
high of $1.31 per gallon (or $1.88 in today's dollars) in 1981.
(Annual Energy Review 1987, op. cit., p. 145. Conversion to 1990
dollars based on Economic Report of the President, 1991, Appendix B,
Table B-58, p. 351.) According to research by Brookings economist
Crandall, these efficiency improvements were almost exactly what could
have been predicted from changes in gas prices alone. (Robert W.
Crandall and Theodore E. Keeler, "Public Policy and the Automobile,"
in Richard L. Gordon, Henry D. Jacoby, and Martin Zimmerman, eds.,
Energy: Markets and Regulation (Cambridge, Mass: MIT Press, 1987).)

<P>  Restricting the Market. Predictably, too, fuel efficiency
improvements in new model cars slowed somewhat after oil prices began
declining in 1982. This is because of the greater demand for larger,
more comfortable, and safer cars. Even so, the average mpg still
increased another 8 percent after 1982. (Gattuso and Jeffreys, op.
cit., p. 4.) But with lower gasoline prices, and the resulting
increase in demand for larger cars, the CAFE standards finally began
to restrict the car market, preventing auto makers from responding to
the turnaround in consumer demand. Instead of simply selling more
large cars, as their customers wanted, manufacturers raised the prices
of larger cars to avoid selling too many of them and thereby running
afoul of the CAFE standards. (See note 17, above.)
<P>
CAFE DOES NOT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE FUEL CONSUMPTION

<P>  Advocates of higher CAFE standards apparently reckon that if
cars get more miles per gallon of gas, people will burn less gas
driving the same number of miles. But, by reducing the number of
gallons of gas needed to drive a given distance, CAFE makes driving
less expensive. Americans have responded to this as would be expected;
they drive their cars more miles. Greater fuel efficiency prompts more
leisure driving and discourages car pooling and the use of public
transportation.

<P>  At the same time, CAFE makes new cars, particularly large
models, more expensive to buy. Thus it creates an incentive for those
who want the comfort, convenience or safety of a larger car to keep
their older cars longer. Others buy used instead of new cars. Yet,
older cars are generally less fuel-efficient than new ones. The result
is that these drivers use more gasoline in a year than they would have
if they had been allowed to buy the kind of car they wanted at a price
they could afford.

<P>  It thus is questionable whether increased CAFE standards would
reduce American gasoline and oil consumption significantly. If the
standards did reduce oil consumption, moreover, they would increase
the share of oil that America imports. The reason: when demand falls,
it is the marginal, highest-cost suppliers that drop out of the
market. Since American oil producers face substantially higher costs
per barrel than producers in other parts of the world, the Americans
would be forced to stop selling oil if the Bryan bill were to succeed
in reducing U.S. oil consumption. (In fact, the percentage of oil
imported has no connection with "dependence" on foreign oil. See,
e.g., Victor A. Conto, "It's BTU-tiful: Energy Markets in the New
Era," A.B. Laffer Associates, September 8, 1987.)
<P>
NO ENVIRONMENTAL IMPROVEMENT

<P>  Some advocates of higher CAFE standards maintain that cars with
higher mpg will pollute less. But by inducing drivers to keep older,
less efficient cars longer, CAFE may increase total emissions of
pollutants by delaying the introduction of newer cars with cleaner-
burning engines and exhaust systems.

<P>  CAFE represents, moreover, an indirect and very ineffective
approach to controlling pollution. If Congress wants to protect the
environment, it can do so at a much lower cost to consumers and the
economy by adopting measures that target auto emissions directly.

<P>  Studies have shown, for example, that approximately half of all
auto emissions are produced by only 10 percent of all cars, most
usually poorly tuned. (See, e.g. "Roadside Emission Test Targets Prime
Offenders," Chemecology, November 1990, pp. 10-11; Rick Henderson,
"Going Mobile," Reason, August/September 1990, pp. 32-36) A properly-
tuned car puts out less emissions than an untuned one, even if both
are driven the same distance, use the same gasoline, and have the same
mpg. CAFE provides no incentive to keep engines in tune nor does it
help to get high-pollution vehicles off the road. A much better
approach would be to measure periodically the exhaust each car
produces and levy a fee directly on the worst polluters.

<P>  Higher CAFE standards sometimes are defended as a way to deal
with the alleged problem of "global warming." The fear is that
increased concentrations in the atmosphere of what are called
"greenhouse gases," such as carbon dioxide and chlorofluorocarbons
(CFCs) supposedly will warm up the Earth's atmosphere, causing
droughts in some areas and coastal flooding in others. But automobiles
are a relatively minor source of these greenhouse gases. While an
"Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change" and the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency have estimated that at least a 50 percent to 80
percent worldwide reduction in carbon dioxide emissions would be
needed to keep the atmosphere's temperature at its current level, (See
Office of Technology Assessment, U.S. Congress, Changing by Degrees:
Steps to Reduce Greenhouse Gases (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government
Printing Office, 1991), p. iii.) the Bryan bill would reduce such
emissions by only about 0.5 percent, even under the most optimistic
assumptions. (This figure is calculated from data given in ibid., pp.
5, 7, 8, 21.)
<P>
CONCLUSION

<P>  An increase in CAFE standards is a poor way to deal with the
alleged problem of high fuel consumption. The bill introduced by
Senator Richard Bryan uses a regulatory, "command-and-control"
approach that fails to balance the need for more energy-efficient cars
with consumer demands. It ignores the market forces which in the past
did increase fuel efficiency. What is worse, higher CAFE standards
would not achieve any of their ostensible purposes. They would not
significantly reduce American fuel consumption or America's alleged
"dependence" on foreign oil. They would not reduce pollution, nor have
any significant effect on the alleged global warming problem. 

<P>  Tragic Consequence. At the same time, the Bryan bill would
reduce the range of choices available to American car buyers while
requiring them to pay substantially more for their cars. The bill also
would reduce the number of American jobs, first in the auto and steel
industries, and then in other sectors that serve the auto industry.
Most tragic, by forcing manufacturers to sell lighter and smaller cars
than customers want, the Bryan Bill would increase major injuries and
deaths on the highways. 

<P>  If Congress wants to foster energy conservation, it simply
should allow the price system to operate freely. As long as Congress
does not reimpose price controls on gasoline and other petroleum
products, as it did in the early 1970s, market prices will provide
consumers with the proper incentive to conserve.

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">D</FONT></B>uring the 1992 presidential race, the Fleetwood Mac song "Don't Stop Thinking 
About Tomorrow" became the official anthem of the Clinton campaign. Once in office, 
the new administration lost little time infusing every facet of its domestic agenda with 
concern about the future. But its defense agenda has been curiously immune to long-term 
thinking. Rather than planning for tomorrow, the administration's defense policies reflect 
a disturbing preoccupation with the concerns of the moment.</P>
<P>	This is a dangerous flaw. The record of the 20th century suggests that the present 
period of diminished global tensions will not last, and that major new threats to national 
survival may emerge in the near future. However, the Clinton administration seems to 
assume that the end of the Cold War meant the end of history, at least as far as great-
power threats to national security were concerned. The result is a U.S. defense budget 
that exhibits high levels of consumption and very low levels of investment.</P>
<P>	Both in their rhetoric and in their resource allocations, senior Pentagon executives 
and many congressional Republicans have been preoccupied with "readiness"--the 
ability to fight effectively on short notice. Readiness is a notoriously nebulous concept, 
but in economic terms it translates into consumption: Money is spent to preserve and 
enhance current capabilities rather than prepare for the future.</P>
<P>	Like other forms of consumption, readiness tends to be bought at the expense of 
procurement of new weapons. In inflation-adjusted terms, Pentagon procurement 
accounts now stand at the lowest levels since 1950, the year the Korean War began. The 
$39 billion requested by the Clinton Administration for weapons procurement in fiscal 
1996 constitutes only 16 percent of a defense budget that itself has shrunk to a mere 15.5 
percent of overall federal expenditures. In other words, the Pentagon's planned spending 
on all types of equipment for military services in fiscal 1996 adds up to only 2.5 percent 
of the federal budget--an amount of money equal to about four months' of sales by the 
Ford Motor Co.</P>
<P>	The Clinton administration contends that this low level of investment is justified 
by a diminished threat and the huge inventory of weapons accumulated during the Cold 
War. It also claims that a planned increase in procurement will lead to "recapitalization" 
of the armed forces toward the end of the 1996-2001 Future Years Defense Plan. 
However, the Pentagon's current predictions for 2001 may not be any more reliable than 
those of science-fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke. It is possible that spending on 
procurement will remain depressed. If that occurs--while high levels of readiness are 
sustained--the armed forces will suffer continued depletion of their weapons inventories.</P>

<H3>Lessons of the Past</H3>
<P>	Unfortunately, the depletion of capital stocks could coincide with the reemergence 
of threats abroad and a revolution in military technology, creating a situation not unlike 
that of the 1930s. The current debate over national-security needs presents a rather 
distressing spectacle in historical amnesia. The struggle with communism for the past two 
generations has so strongly influenced policymakers that they exhibit little apparent 
capacity for interpreting that experience in a broader context.</P>
<P>	The Cold War was the third occasion in this century when the U.S. mobilized to 
prevent anti-democratic forces from dominating Eurasia. The century began with the 
challenge posed by German imperialism, and barely a generation later the U.S. was at war 
again, this time to defeat fascism. The outcome of WWII then set the stage for the anti-
communist crusade of the post-war period. </P>
<P>	Note that the same pattern repeated itself with each new danger. Regional powers 
gradually accumulated land and resources while the United States was distracted; early 
warnings that a great-power threat was emerging were greeted with widespread 
skepticism; when the threat became urgent, U.S. leaders discovered they were woefully 
unprepared and commenced a hasty mobilization; once the threat passed, the nation 
engaged in an equally hasty demobilization. After a period of relative tranquillity, the 
cycle has repeated itself.</P>
<P>	It is remarkable that the political elite of a world power could experience three 
complete threat cycles in one century and still not grasp the basic lesson that a fourth 
such challenge is likely sometime relatively soon. As Colin Gray, a military theorist, has 
noted, "American policymaking in the national security area tends to be dominated by 
people with a poor sense of the value of history." Whatever the explanation, current U.S. 
defense policies reflect a startling lack of strategic vision.</P>
<P>	For example, the 1993 Bottom-Up Review was conceived by the Clinton 
administration as a comprehensive assessment of military resources and requirements for 
the post-Cold War period. It prudently concluded that U.S. forces should be able to 
successfully prosecute "two major regional conflicts that occur nearly simultaneously." 
And yet nowhere in the document is the historical significance of regional conflicts 
clearly spelled out--that great-power threats to U.S. security typically originate in 
regional aggression not countered in a timely manner. </P>
<P>	From this perspective, the real danger posed by Saddam Hussein in 1990-91 was 
not his violent annexation of Kuwait, for the invasion of Kuwait was no more significant 
than Japan's occupation of Manchuria in 1931 or Germany's remilitarization of the 
Rhineland in 1936. The danger lies in the bolder designs an aggressor might pursue if he 
encounters no resistance.</P>
<P>	History thus provides a compelling reason for being ready to fight. But it also 
teaches that the emergence of aggressive great powers is characteristic of the geopolitical 
landscape, and that unless the United States continually invests in new defense 
capabilities, it may eventually be unable to avoid defeat at the hands of such a power.</P>
<P>	Viewed against this backdrop, the fundamental defect of the Clinton 
administration's defense plan is all too evident: It purchases current readiness at the price 
of future preparedness. When procurement spending is inadequate, high levels of 
readiness inevitably use up weapons for which there are no replacements. Meanwhile, a 
drop in military contracts prompts the production base of the defense industry to atrophy. 
The U.S. thus gradually loses the military and industrial capacity to respond effectively to 
aggression.</P>
<P>	The Clinton administration recognizes this problem and therefore has begun to 
plan for the "recapitalization" of the armed forces--an unfortunate appropriation of a 
term usually associated with the restructuring of bankrupt organizations. But the concept 
of bankruptcy may not be entirely misplaced, because administration plans make future 
procurement increases contingent on raising the overall defense budget and realizing 
substantial savings from base closures and acquisition reform. None of these sources can 
be counted on to generate enough money for a sustained surge in investment.</P>

<H3>The "Procurement Holiday"</H3>
<P>	The Congressional Budget Office refers to the current slump in weapons 
purchases as a "procurement holiday." But like Franklin Roosevelt's "bank holiday" 
during the darkest days of the Great Depression, this is merely a pleasant way of 
describing a system on the verge of collapse. The real buying power of the Pentagon's 
procurement budget declined 67 percent between fiscal 1985--the peak year of President 
Reagan's defense buildup--and fiscal 1995. The administration proposes a procurement 
budget of only $39 billion in 1996, which would bring the total reduction from the peak 
in fiscal 1985 to 71 percent. Backlogs in defense contracts are expected to contract 
eventually by a similar amount, forcing many defense contractors to exit the business and 
reducing competition among those who remain.</P>
<P>	No other part of the defense budget has experienced a comparable decline. The 
major categories of weapons-related expenditures correspond roughly with the key stages 
in the product life cycle: research and development, procurement, and operations and 
maintenance. The operations and maintenance budget includes most of the spending 
related to readiness, whereas R&D, together with procurement, constitutes most 
investment spending. All three accounts declined between fiscal 1990 (the year the Berlin 
Wall fell) and fiscal 1995. But procurement shrank from 28 percent of a relatively large 
budget to 17 percent of a much smaller budget. In constant 1995 dollars, procurement 
spending fell in just five years from $94 billion to $43 billion--a 54 percent cut.</P>
<P>	The impact of declining procurement expenditures on the production of major 
weapon systems has been dramatic:</P>
<UL><LI>  In fiscal 1996, the Air Force does not plan to purchase a single fighter or bomber. In 
fact, it plans to purchase no new bombers throughout the 1996-2001 Future Years 
Defense Plan, even though nearly half of its long-range bombers are more than 30 years 
old, and the sole fighter program it has in development (the F-22) has been repeatedly cut 
back and delayed.<BR>
<LI>  The Navy plans to purchase seven ships in fiscal 1996, only a third as many as it 
purchased in 1990. Over the course of the Future Years Defense Plan, it will buy just one 
submarine every other year from its last remaining sub manufacturer, and many observers 
believe the recently authorized CVN-76 will be the last large-deck carrier the service 
procures.<BR>
<LI>  The Army has stopped purchasing main battle tanks, and has no plans to resume 
purchases any time in the next 15 years. It has been unable to find sufficient funding to 
support upgrades to its existing tanks at an economic rate.</UL>
<P>	The Clinton administration argues that reduced levels of procurement are an 
appropriate response to the end of the Cold War, and that the high procurement 
expenditures of the Reagan-Bush years have made it possible to adequately equip 
shrinking military forces without buying new weapons. Senior administration officials 
point out that R&D spending for new weapons technologies has declined only 
moderately, and that when recapitalization commences early in the next century, it will 
not be necessary to replace weapons on a one-for-one basis. They also claim that by the 
time it is necessary to increase procurement, acquisition reforms will make it possible to 
acquire some military systems more quickly and less expensively from commercial 
sources. Finally, they note that a 47 percent real increase in procurement is planned 
between fiscal 1996 and 2001.</P>
<P>	If all of these assertions proved true, there would be little reason for concern. The 
U.S. would presumably be well-positioned for the challenges that might arise in the next 
century. However, the administration's positions obscure as much as they reveal, and are 
based on assumptions that may prove to be unreliable. For example, the same acquisition 
reforms that supposedly will enable the armed forces to buy advanced technologies more 
quickly and cheaply from commercial sources will also facilitate the transfer of those 
technologies to potential adversaries. As the acquisition system places increased 
emphasis on "dual-use" technologies with both military and commercial applications, it is 
inevitable that foreign nations will gain greater access to advanced military capabilities. 
Acquisition reform could thus hasten the emergence of new threats.</P>
<P>	The contention that a smaller force structure can be adequately equipped from 
existing weapons inventories has some validity. For instance, the average age of ships in 
the Navy's active fleet is declining despite the low level of new procurement, because 
older ships are being retired in large numbers. However, the administration's own data 
demonstrate that many key military systems are approaching the mid-point of their 
projected lives, and will eventually require replacements. Furthermore, continuously 
depressed levels of new procurement will gradually erode the defense industry's capacity 
to produce those replacements. In the case of the submarine business, the Navy will soon 
be dependent on a single shipyard that is producing only one boat every two years. If 
even one submarine is removed from the production schedule, the supplier base will 
probably collapse.</P>
<P>	The most misleading argument the administration advances is that it is cutting 
procurement while maintaining R&D specifically in order to prepare for future threats. 
That ignores what is being developed and what is actually being procured. In December, 
the administration announced that the Army's highest-priority acquisition program, the 
Comanche helicopter, would be kept in development and not moved forward to 
production. The Comanche is the only truly stealthy aircraft likely to enter the Army 
inventory in the next 20 years, so deferring its production means soldiers will have to 
face future threats in increasingly vulnerable conventional helicopters. Thus the benefits 
of a decade of development are being lost because of a decision not to procure.</P>
<P>	Similarly, the administration is resisting congressional efforts to procure 
additional B-2 "stealth" bombers even though there is extensive evidence that the planned 
force of 20 B-2s and 200 older bombers cannot meet projected operational requirements. 
Opposing further purchases of the B-2 might make sense if a cheaper and equally 
survivable alternative were under development, but it isn't. Instead, the Air Force plans to 
rely on vulnerable B-1s and B-52s to carry out the bulk of future long-range bombing 
missions. Here again, the benefits of a $20-billion development effort are being 
squandered, with no long-term plan for recovery in sight.</P>

<H3>Bad Trade</H3>
<P>	It is obvious that such decisions are not being driven by doctrinal or operational 
considerations. They are dictated by budgetary pressures. The Clinton administration 
apparently has concluded that unless there is a significant increase in defense spending, 
readiness can only be maintained by drastically limiting investment. This is a tradeoff that 
cannot be continued indefinitely because low levels of procurement eventually translate 
into low levels of preparedness. It is a tradeoff that is not only unacceptable, but 
unnecessary. To avoid this trap, the Pentagon must get serious about privatizing military 
support functions.</P>
<P>	In recent years, many private companies have restructured their operations to 
focus on core competencies. By shedding activities that either are not central to the 
organization's mission or can be performed less expensively by others, companies are 
able to emphasize what they do well and thereby improve their efficiency. The 
Department of Defense is overdue for such a restructuring. Although the department has 
undergone considerable downsizing and there is much talk of "reinventing" what 
remains, there is little evidence of greater efficiency. The result is that even in the midst 
of a budget crisis, the Pentagon continues to waste huge amounts of money.</P>
<P>	The defense department lacks market discipline, and exhibits many of the 
managerial defects of a top-down monopoly. That is hardly surprising, because the 
department was established to exercise a monopoly in the application of military power, 
and like the rest of the federal government it is not a product of economic forces. But it 
still can benefit from those forces.</P>
<P>	After WWII, the department accumulated a vast array of support functions--such 
as supply management, equipment maintenance, dependent health care, data processing, 
accounting, and commissaries--that, while necessary to the effective exercise of military 
power, do not need to be performed by the government. One way of freeing up money for 
additional procurement is to gradually privatize those support functions that can be 
provided by private-sector sources.</P>
<P>	The Office of Management and Budget has estimated that the federal government 
saves nearly $10,000 every time the functions of a worker are contracted out. On average, 
the government "outsourcing" saves 20 to 30 percent per contract. However, contracting 
out and privatization have been constrained by convention and by concern that critical 
services might not be available from private-sector providers in wartime. There is little 
empirical basis for this concern, and the cost of continuing to make policy as if it were 
valid is staggering. For example, studies of the $15-billion depot-maintenance system for 
conducting weapons repairs have found 25 to 50 percent of the system is unneeded 
capacity. Some outsourcing of depot maintenance already occurs, but complete 
privatization could probably save billions of dollars every year.</P>
<P>	There are numerous other examples of defense support activities that could be 
privatized. About 48,000 civilian and military personnel are engaged in supply and 
distribution activities. Overhead costs for goods delivered by these personnel average 70 
to 90 percent of the value of the goods themselves, a high figure by private-sector 
standards. The transportation, storage, and administrative costs associated with buying 
and distributing spare parts alone is roughly $5 billion per year, not counting the cost of 
the parts. Many private-sector companies have developed advanced inventory 
management and distribution systems that could substantially cut these costs.</P>
<P>	Financial-information systems is another area that could benefit from 
privatization. The Pentagon reported in 1994 that of 28 major audits of its operations in 
the previous year, 26 were unfavorable. During the same year, the department was unable 
to match $19 billion in disbursements to specific contractual requirements, meaning the 
money may have been paid erroneously. The level of unmatched disbursements is all the 
more striking in view of the fact that it requires more than 100 separate transactions for 
the department to issue a single check. Despite all of these steps, many of which 
presumably exist to prevent mistakes, the chief of staff of the Air Force recently said that 
"it would be nice if we knew what actual costs were, but our accounting systems often do 
not perform this simple and reasonable service."</P>
<P>	The Clinton administration is striving mightily to "reinvent" the Pentagon's 
financial management systems, but "deinvention" might make more sense. The private 
sector is full of data-management and accounting firms that long ago solved the challenge 
of tracking money within large organizations. Many large firms have turned over their 
day-to-day financial-support requirements to these firms. The Pentagon should seriously 
consider doing the same thing, just as it should consider turning over the post-exchange 
and commissary functions to Wal-Mart.</P>
<P>	An example of how greater reliance on the marketplace could reduce defense 
support costs is provided by the General Services Administration's 1991 decision to 
transfer time-urgent delivery functions to FedEx Corp. The General Accounting Office 
estimates that relying on private-sector sources for overnight delivery reduced the 
government's costs by 76 percent. FedEx's performance was such an improvement that 
the Air Force is increasingly relying on private-sector providers for its own deliveries of 
critical spare parts.</P>
<P>	Nobody really knows how much money the Department of Defense might save 
through the wholesale privatization of support functions. But the annual savings could 
eventually be sufficient to sustain higher levels of procurement without cutting readiness 
or force structure. In fact, privatization would have multiple benefits for the procurement 
budget: Not only would it free up funds for weapons purchases, but transferring 
weapons-support functions to the companies that make the systems could also help 
preserve critical industrial capabilities and reduce the overhead costs they charge on 
procurement contracts.</P> 
<P>	If there is a final lesson in all this, it is that there is no substitute for vision, 
whether strategic or managerial. We may not be able to know the future, but we certainly 
can have a reasonably clear idea of what the past tells us about the range of possibilities. 
In the case of defense spending, past experience warns against a prolonged drought in 
investment, particularly when high levels of readiness are gradually consuming existing 
capital equipment. In the case of defense management, past experience dictates that the 
marketplace is the most efficient provider of goods, and that continuing to perform 
support functions within the government reduces the military's capacity to accomplish its 
mission. These are easy lessons to grasp; the question is whether we will have the 
courage to act on them. Investing more in modern weapons while privatizing support 
functions would prove that, for once, we have learned from our past mistakes.</P>

ABUSE OF THE MILITARY</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
Military personnel discharged for homosexuality often file complaints
in federal court seeking reinstatement.  The current groundswell
of cases is tying up the federal court system.  Congress has the
authority to direct that the military courts, which are better
equipped to resolve these cases, assume the litigation burden.
<P>
On January 28, 1993, California-based U.S. District Judge Terry
J. Hatter, Jr. held that the military's policy excluding homosexuals
was unconstitutional and enjoined the entire Department of Defense
from discharging or denying enlistment based on sexual orientation.
 He also enjoined the Pentagon from maintaining files having to
do with the sexual orientation of any member of the armed forces
in the absence of conduct affecting the military mission.
<P>
Hatter's decision came in the case of Petty Officer Keith Meinhold,
who announced on <I>ABC World News Tonight</I>: "Yes, I am,
in fact, gay."  On appeal, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals struck down Hatter's earlier decision to extend the decision
to the entire Defense Department and criticized him for accepting
the case before the military appeal process was exhausted.  
<P>
However, immediately after Hatter's decision and before the appeal,
Assistant Secretary of Defense Edwin Dorn cited the decision in
order to force the armed services to lift the ban.  This was an
unusual response to a district court order.  In the past, decisions
involving only one soldier have never been generalized to the
entire military.
<P>
The military discharges hundreds of personnel for homosexuality
each year.  Homosexual activist groups such as the Lambda Legal
Defense and Education Fund are leading a national campaign to
defeat the military's homosexual law in the courts.  According
to Michelle Benecke, co-director for the pro-homosexual Servicemembers
Legal Defense Network, hundreds of former military members discharged
for homosexuality are seeking reinstatement through the federal
court system.[1]
<P>
Each federal case taxes the courts.  The trail for each case through
the military administrative system and the federal judicial system
is both time-consuming and costly.  For example, a service member
discharged administratively under the Pentagon's homosexual regulations
receives an administrative hearing.  The results of that hearing
are reviewed, and then, subject to the review, the member is discharged
from the service.  Other service members discharged for consensual homosexual acts are often
given administrative misconduct
discharges or courts-martial.  In either case, the former member
has a couple of years to file a complaint against the federal
government seeking reinstatement.  Most discharged members seek
relief by questioning the constitutionality of the decision: 1)
violation of due process, 2) infringement of free speech, 3) discrimination,
and 4) the unlawfulness of criminalizing sodomy.
<P>
<CENTER><H3> A CASE IN POINT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Former midshipman Joseph C. Steffan was dismissed for declaring
himself a homosexual while at the U.S. Naval Academy in 1987.
 He received an administrative hearing and chose to submit a "qualified
resignation" in May 1987.  A year and a half later, he wrote
the Secretary of the Navy seeking to withdraw his resignation
and continue his education at the Academy.  The request was denied.
 Steffan brought suit in federal court in 1989, charging that
the Academy's regulations were unconstitutional.
<P>
Steffan's initial federal court foray was decided in November
1989.  The court dismissed the case, citing Steffan's refusal
to cooperate with the court.  On January 10, 1991 Steffan filed
a request for documents which were to be used in a presumed appeal.
 The appeal that followed was decided by a three-judge panel from
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit
on November 16, 1993.  The same appeals court then called for
a rehearing of the case by the entire 11-member court.  The full
court reversed the previous ruling on November 22, 1994.  Steffan
ended his six-year court battle in January 1995 when he decided
not to take his challenge of the military's policy to the Supreme
Court.
<P>
 <CENTER><H3>A COST-SAVING ALTERNATIVE</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The military has an operational court system which could be required
by Congress to hear homosexual discharge complaints.  The military
courts are better equipped to consider such cases than the federal
court system, and such a move would save the federal government
millions of dollars in federal judiciary expenses and likely provide
a more thorough and faster resolution to the growing number of
homosexual complaints.
<P>
Congress must consider passing a law awarding limited civil jurisdiction
to military courts to handle homosexual complaints.  Should there
be a concern that the military courts might try to expand the
jurisdiction, another, although less attractive, alternative is
available.  Congressional designation of the District of Columbia
Circuit Court of Appeals as the sole appeals court for all military
homosexual cases would also provide a more consistent view of
the issue.  Federal district courts would still give decisions
on initial complaints, but only the D.C. Circuit would hear the
cases on appeal.  This both saves the government money and brings
consistency to a complex and specialized issue.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
	Congress initiated a process for closing military bases in 1988 when it became clear that the United States was going to reduce the size of its military forces after the Cold War. To provide guidance on base-closing decisions, Congress created the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission, an independent body of eight individuals with  expertise in defense policy. The commission was assigned the responsibility of deciding which military bases will be closed or realigned and submitting its recommendations to the President and Congress.
<p>

	Until recently, the base closure process had been successful. Independent commissions made recommendations to reduce defense infrastructure in 1988, 1991, and 1993. The President and Congress ultimately adopted each of the packages of recommendations, and the closure and realignment decisions are being implemented. But the latest round of base closings, which is the last currently planned, has been flawed in several important respects. The process has been politicized by the White House. Anticipated budget savings have been disappointingly meager. And base closures have lagged behind reductions in military forces, personnel, and budgets. There still are too many bases for the size of the U.S. armed forces anticipated by Administration policy.
<p>
	  The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission submitted its recommendations to the President on July 1. These include decisions to close 28 major bases, realign 22 major bases, and close or realign a larger number of minor bases. President Clinton on July 13 reluctantly accepted the commission's recommendations. As Congress considers these recommendations, there are several problems with the base closure and realignment process that must be addressed. Each presents an opportunity for a legislative remedy. Congress should:
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Accept the findings of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission.</b> The military services need to close bases. The retention of unneeded bases will impose a financial drain on the military at a time when its budget has been reduced. The money saved by closing bases can be used to fund vital military readiness and modernization programs. The base closure process, therefore, must move forward. A decision by Congress to reject the findings of the commission will require the military to absorb the cost of maintaining 22 major bases and a larger number of minor bases it does not need.
<br>
<li><b>Extend the base closure process for another two rounds.</b> The closing of military bases still lags behind the reduction in military forces, personnel, and budgets. While defense budgets have declined by about 35 percent in real terms between FY1985 and FY1994, and military personnel levels have dropped by 25 percent over the same time, the size of base infrastructure has fallen by only 15 percent. This year's list of base closures and realignments submitted by the Department of Defense, as modified by the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission, makes it likely this lag will continue. Since this is the last round of base closures authorized by Title XXIX of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 1991, Congress should extend the closure and realignment process for another two rounds.
<br>
<li><b>Increase its oversight of the process by which the Administration recommends base closures to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission.</b> According to numerous press reports, the White House may have politicized the process of base closings by pressing the Department of Defense to remove bases from the closure list in states that loom large in next year's presidential race. This process was established with the intent of separating political considerations from base closure decisions. Congress needs to call the Clinton White House to account if it has attempted to politicize the process. It can start by holding hearings on whether there were attempts by aides at the White House to intervene.
<br>
<li><b>Reduce the cost of closing bases.</b> The ultimate goal of the base closure process is to reduce the cost of carrying unnecessary infrastructure. This will free up money to support military readiness and modernization. It has become apparent, however, that it is costing the Pentagon considerable sums of money to shut down the bases and that savings are not realized until years later. Congress can ease this problem by scaling back the environmental and other regulations that drive up the initial costs of closing bases. This includes shortening the lengthy process for evaluating the environmental status of bases about to closed. Further, Congress should ensure that such closing costs come not from the defense budget, badly strapped by cuts, but from such other federal accounts as the environmental account or the community development account.
<br>
<li><b>Privatize military depots.</b> The cost of performing depot maintenance is too high. In addition to making recommendations for closing or realigning regular military bases, the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission has the power to recommend closing military depots, which are logistical and maintenance facilities. The rate of closing depots is roughly the same as that for regular military bases. Congress could spur this process by enacting legislation to privatize many of the maintenance duties now performed at Defense Department depots.
</ul>
<p>


<b>THE BASE CLOSURE PROCESS IN PERSPECTIVE</b>
<p>
	The Reagan Administration began the base closure process in 1988. Subsequent recommendations for reductions were adopted in 1991 and 1993. Since Cold War defense budgets peaked in 1985 and major military personnel reductions began in 1990, the process has run concurrently with the general budget and force reductions at the Pentagon.
<p>
	But the base closure process has not led to a reduction in military infrastructure that is commensurate with other defense cutbacks. While defense budgets have declined by about 35 percent in real terms between FY 1985 and FY 1994, and military personnel levels have dropped by 25 percent over the same time, the base infrastructure has fallen by only 15 percent as measured in replacement value (see Chart 1).1  The same lag appears between base closures and reductions in military forces. For example, during the period covering FY 1988 through FY 1994, the Army shed eight divisions or, roughly 30 percent of its force structure. Yet base reductions involving all the services, as measured in replacement value, have fallen by just 15 percent. Similar comparisons can be made for the Air Force and Navy (see  Chart 2).
<p>
	The  budget savings derived from the three previous rounds of base closings are disappointing. The Pentagon estimates net savings to the defense budget from all three of the previous rounds of base closures at just $3.1 billion (1996 dollars).2  Savings have been lower than might be expected because the cost of shutting down the bases was $13.1 billion (in 1996 dollars).3  Absent the closure costs, the savings would be $16.2 billion (in 1996 dollars). After the payment of closure costs, the estimated annual savings are $4.2 billion (again in 1996 dollars).4<p>	Excess  depot capacity is likely to be as great a problem as excess military infrastructure. As military equipment inventories have fallen, the depots to service this equipment have not been eliminated. For example, between 1988 and 1994 the Air Force reduced the number of fighter and attack aircraft authorized for deployment by almost 50 percent. Assuming Air Force depots have been reduced at roughly the same rate as bases generally, the depots have been reduced by only 15 percent.5<p><b>THE PENTAGON'S RECOMMENDATIONS ON BASE CLOSURES</b><p>	The Department of Defense forwarded its recommendations for closing and realigning bases to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission on February 28, 1995. The recommendations proposed closing 33 major bases or facilities and realigning (closing a portion of a base or moving one or more of its functions) 26 others. A larger number of smaller facilities would be closed or realigned. As measured in replacement value, the recommendations would have reduced defense infrastructure by about 6 percent. Assuming this is the last round, all the rounds combined would reduce military infrastructure by 21 percent from 1991 levels, as measured in replacement value.6<p>	The recommendations of the Department of Defense do not go far enough. The resulting base structure will be too large for the size of the U.S. armed forces. For example, the Clinton Administration's projected defense budget for the year 2000 wou
ld be 58 percent of the 1985 defense budget in real terms. The number of active duty military personnel in the year 2000 would fall to 67 percent of the number in 1985. Military infrastructure, by contrast, would still be roughly 79 percent of what it was in 1985 under the Pentagon's base closure recommendation. Force structure reductions in the Air Force, Army, and Navy will also be far deeper than the corresponding cutbacks in infrastructure.
<p>
	Political considerations. Given the pressing need to reduce military infrastructure in the United States, the relatively modest recommendations of the Department of Defense were surprising. It was widely expected that in this round of base closures the Department of Defense would propose reducing military infrastructure by as much as the three previous rounds combined.
<p>
	Of course, this did not happen. The likely explanation is political intervention by the White House. President Clinton's aides reportedly attempted in 1994 to put off the entire round of reductions slated for this year because they feared the negative repercussions for President Clinton's reelection effort in affected states.7  White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta reportedly intervened with Secretary of Defense William Perry later last year to have the scope of the reductions trimmed.8<p>	The politicization of the process became apparent when President Clinton boasted in a January 1995 radio interview that the Navy's shipyard near Portsmouth, New Hampshire, would not be included on the list of closed bases. Indeed, the Portsmouth facility was not included in the Secretary's recommended closure list. Thus, the White House knew what the Secretary of Defense was going to recommend more than a month before the Pentagon submitted its recommendations. Nevertheless, the report of the Secretary of Defense to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission asserts that the recommendations for the closure of military bases were objective and nonpolitical.9  This appears not to be the case.<p><b>THE DELIBERATIONS OF THE BASE CLOSURE AND REALIGNMENT COMMISSION</b><p>To its credit, the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission apparently recognized and tried to resist the Clinton Administration's attempt to politicize the process. The commission on May 10 announced it had added 31 bases to the list recommended by the Secretary of Defense for either closure or realignment.10  The additional bases included the Portsmouth shipyard. Press reports indicated that the White House was particularly interested in striking bases from the list that were located in California, New Hampshire, and Texas.11  Nevertheless, of the 31 bases added to the list by the commission, 13, or almost 42 percent, are located in or near these three states.<p>	The commission on July 1 announced its list of bases for closure or reali
gnment.12 Despite its earlier action of adding bases to its list for consideration that were not included in the recommendation submitted by the Secretary of Defense, the commission chose not to expand the number of major bases to be closed or realigned. In fact, the  commission ultimately decided to close only 28 major military bases instead of the 33 proposed earlier by the Pentagon. The commission also recommended realigning another 22 major bases. This compares to 26 realignments recommended to the commission by the Department of Defense. The closures and realignments proposed by the commission probably will shrink the military infrastructure by about 6 percent. 
<p>

<b>IMPROVING THE BASE CLOSURE PROCESS</b>
<p>
	To be a complete success, the base closure process needs to be extended and improved. This will require Congress to:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Accept the findings of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission.</b> Moving the base closure process forward first requires implementing the current round of cutbacks. Congress should not force the military to carry the cost of maintaining unneeded bases. Congress can take a step toward preserving the base closure process by accepting the commission's findings.
<br>
<li><b>Extend the base closure process for another two rounds.</b> The additional two rounds will reduce military bases to between 64 percent and 69 percent of what they were during the Cold War. Even after these two additional rounds, the cutback in bases will trail reductions in military budgets, personnel, and forces.     Defense budgets and force structure will be around 60 percent of Cold War levels. These rounds should occur in 1997 and 1999.
<br>
<li><b> Increase its oversight of the process by which the Administration recommends base closures to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission.</b> The political manipulation of the base closure process by the White House, if true, is unacceptable. Preventing such abuses in the future will require rigorous congressional oversight. The first step requires determining whether the charges leveled at the White House by the press are true. The House and Senate Military Construction Appropriations Subcommittees should hold hearings on these charges and require both White House staff and Pentagon officials to testify.
<br>
<li><b>Reduce the cost of closing bases.</b> Savings in the base closure process have been low because the cost of shutting down bases is too high. Closing bases has become an expensive proposition for several reasons. First of all, the procedures for selling off bases and other facilities are being circumvented. Many of the properties are retained by the Department of Defense or given to other federal agencies, or to state and local governments, at no cost.13  Selling these properties to the private sector would help offset the closure costs.
<p>
	The second reason for the high costs is that local governments are successfully pressuring the federal government to provide grants and other assistance to them in order to support the conversion of properties. Such improvements include  building roads and sewer systems, many of which are funded through the defense budget. This has turned the Department of Defense into a community development agency. Funding such social and economic projects is not a proper function of the Department. The federal government needs to exercise discipline in rejecting the demands of local communities for assistance in upgrading and improving the  properties that are being disposed of by the Department of Defense.
<p>
	The third reason is that the cost of environmental cleanup is too high. The Department of Defense is expected to spend over $5 billion on environmental cleanup, much of it for cleaning up closed bases. Some of these costs are caused by unrealistic federal and local environmental requirements; cleaning ground water, for example, is likely to be expensive and in some cases impossible. Some are due to unnecessary environmental policies that put a high priority on cleanup. These policies at times result in the needless cleanup of land that will remain in federal hands and therefore not require cleanup prior to reuse.14  The Pentagon should be relieved of the costs of environmental cleanup altogether. Other federal agencies or departments, such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or a new Bureau of Natural Resources, should be given responsibility for these costs.15<li><b>Privatize military depots.</b> The base closure commission has focused on reducing the number of military depots to the level required to meet expected demand for depot service. Many of the depot functions, however, can be privatized and performed by contractors. Not only is it likely that private enterprises can perform these services more efficiently, but the Pentagon will be able to reap a dividend by selling the properties to the private sector.16  This is not to say that all such functions can be privatized. All maintenance duties that require close proximity to combat operations, or that are a part of combat operations, should remain in the hands of the military. Nevertheless, many other functions, and the associated facilities, should be privatized. This would allow the commission to be far more aggressive in closing down depots.
</ul><p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
	Base closings must continue if the military is going to maintain its combat capabilities. The excess infrastructure, if not shed, will continue to be a financial drain on the military services. In an era of shrinking defense budgets, this financial drain will weaken America's combat readiness and defense modernization programs. Shedding excess infrastructure requires extending the base closure process by another two rounds. It also entails finding ways to reduce the cost of closing bases. Further, politics must be kept out of the base closure process. Only then can the savings achieved from closing unneeded military bases be used to fund the U.S. armed forces' most important function -- preparing to fight and win the nation's wars.

INTRODUCTION
  <P>   "Our new security strategy will... ensure our defense industry
can supply the weapons and technologies America may need in the
future." So promised then-candidate Bill Clinton in an August 13,
1992, speech before the World Affairs Council of Los Angeles. But just
a few moments later in the speech, Clinton charged that: "There is
today no plan to help our defense workers and military personnel make
a transition to a civilian economy. I have such a plan." Candidate
Clinton thus promised to preserve America's military industrial base
while at the same time converting it to civilian production. Therein
lies a serious contradiction. The weapons and technologies America may
need in the future cannot be made if too many defense industries are
converted to manufacture gas-saving automobiles, for example, instead
of tanks and armored personnel carriers.
<P>
     President Clinton's defense industrial policy has been marked by
two initiatives. On March 11, during a speech outside Baltimore, he
announced a $20 billion defense conversion program. Two weeks later,
he took a step that was tantamount to abandoning the defense
industrial base: he proposed reducing defense budget authority by over
3.5 percent per year over the next five years. (This figure is
calculated in so-called real terms, accounting for the expected rise
in inflation.  Department of Defense, "FY 1994 Defense Budget Begins
New Era," News Release No.  126-93, March 27, 1993.  The news release
is accompanied by a package of supporting materials that provides
total defense budget figures for the period covering fiscal years 1994
through 1998 and detailed information on the fiscal 1994 defense
budget request.) This budget proposal doubles the $60 billion cut
Clinton promised during the campaign. The largest decreases in the
fiscal 1994 defense budget will come in accounts for the procurement
of weapons and equipment. Not having these funds will especially
weaken the defense industrial base because they are the main fuel for
industrial production. The budget authority for procurement spending
will diminish by over $8 billion, or 17 percent in real terms, from
the 1993 level to $45.5 billion in 1994. (Ibid.) Reductions of this
magnitude will make it impossible for the defense industry to produce
an adequate supply of weapons and technologies for America's defense
needs.
<P>
     For Clinton to avoid devastating the military industrial base and
the nation's military posture, he must reverse course. He should:
<P>
     Concentrate his long-range defense planning above all on the
     industrial needs of the armed forces, and not on converting the
     defense industrial base to civilian production.
<P>
     Eliminate the $20 billion defense conversion program. 
<P>
     Focus defense planning on the building and buying of the next
     generation of weapons.
<P>
     Give governmental support to specific defense industries only as
     a last resort. There may be times when the government will have
     to support a particular defense industry -- one which
     manufactures submarines, for example -- which may not appear to
     be needed in the short run, but which may be needed to meet some
     future threat.
<P>
CLINTON'S DEFENSE CONVERSION POLICY
<P>
     The Clinton defense conversion plan was developed during the 1992
presidential campaign and the first months of his Administration. The
policy was announced on March 11 in a speech by the President to the
employees of Westinghouse Electronics Systems, outside Baltimore. The
$20 billion program is based on four principles: 
<P>
Principle #1: America's so-called defense economy needs to be
     converted tocivilian production. 
<P>
     Clinton believes that the Cold War produced a U.S. economy
heavily burdened by defense expenditures. Supposedly all this spending
on defense deprives the economy and the government of funds for
domestic programs. Also it supposedly distorts the economy toward non-
productive purposes.
<P>
Principle #2: The federal government should play a central role in
     managing defense conversion. 
<P>
     Of the $20 billion that the Clinton Administration proposes to
spend over a five-year period on defense conversion, $10 billion will
go to so-called investments in government-selected civilian
technologies. This is predicated on the notion that the government
knows better than the businesses already operating in the market which
civilian technologies will sell. Another $4 billion of Clinton's
program will go to government-sponsored retraining programs for
displaced defense workers. And $1 billion will provide federal
assistance to local communities hurt by defense cutbacks. Only one-
fourth of the funds, about $5 billion, will be spent on programs that
have potential military utility. These funds will go to developing
"dual-use" technologies, meaning those that have both military and
civilian applications.
<P>
Principle #3: The primary purpose of the defense conversion is to
     preserve defense production capabilities for the civilian
     economy. 
<P>
     In making his announcement at the Westinghouse facility, Clinton
extolled the facility's effort to increase civilian production from 16
percent of total output in 1986 to a projected level of 50 percent by
1995. He hopes to encourage this type of conversion around the
country. As the President said in his Westinghouse speech: "What you
have done here [at Westinghouse] is what I wish to do nationally --
take the most talented people in the world who've produced some of the
most sophisticated military technology and put that to work in the
civilian economy."
<P>
Principle #4: The impact of defense conversion on national security
     will be marginal. 
<P>
     Clinton says: "With the dwindling Soviet threat, we can cut
defense spending over a third by 1997." The President clearly believes
that these levels of defense cuts can be made without weakening
national security. By the same token, Secretary of Defense Les Aspin
argues that poor economic performance -- supposedly caused partly by
too much defense spending -- is itself a national security threat.
"The danger here," says Aspin, "is the failure to see our national
security interests in a way that includes our economic success.
Economic well-being is vital to our security." Seen in this way,
spending on domestic programs can be said to have some bearing on
national security.
<P>
CLINTON'S DEFENSE DRAWDOWN IN PERSPECTIVE
<P>
     The defense budget began declining well before the end of the
Persian Gulf War and the election of Bill Clinton. In fact, defense
budget authority in real terms peaked in fiscal 1985, well before the
end of the Cold War. This downturn in defense spending has been
gradual. But critics of the armed forces, including President Clinton,
argue that the American economy is suffering from massive dislocations
because of a rapid "demilitarization" of the economy. While some
communities are suffering severe economic problems as a result of the
defense drawdown, the economy as a whole has not been greatly damaged
as a result of the defense cuts. This is because defense is not a
large segment of the economy and because defense expenditures impose
only a modest burden on the economy.
<P>
     President Clinton, though, is trapped by his belief that he
inherited what he terms a "defense economy." He is wrong. The money
the government will actually spend on defense in 1993 -- so-called
outlays -- will constitute only 4.7 percent of gross domestic product
(GDP). Clinton's budget will reduce that burden to around 3 percent by
1998. By focusing on the marginal improvements to the economy that may
be obtained by "making a transition to a civilian economy," Clinton
ignores the impact of his decision on the U.S. military posture. While
the Clinton defense reductions affect only 1.7 percent of GDP over a
five-year period, they will result in a defense budget reduction of 18
percent and reductions of perhaps 50 percent by 1998 in the amount the
Pentagon spends on weapons and equipment. (The Clinton Administration
has not released defense procurement budget figures for the years
beyond fiscal 1994.) When coupled with budget reductions already
imposed under Ronald Reagan and George Bush, the defense spending
trend under Clinton is even more disturbing. After accounting for
inflation, the fiscal 1993 procurement budget is only 43 percent of
what it was at its peak in 1985. (Department of Defense, National
Defense Budget Estimates for FY 1994 (Washington, D.C.:  Department of
Defense, 1993), p.  80.)
<P>

The Defense Drawdown After World War II 
<P>
     During World War II, the nation truly had a defense economy. In
the war's last year, 1945, over 39 percent of the nation's GDP was
devoted to defense. By 1948, less than 4 percent of GDP was spent on
defense. (Ibid., p.  140.) Defense spending in 1945 was $714 billion
in 1987 dollars; by 1948, it was under $65 billion. Thus, in only
three years, defense spending had fallen by 90 percent. (Ibid., p. 
128.)
<P>
     By contrast, defense accounted for just 6.5 percent of GDP in
1986. Today it is 4.7 percent. (Ibid., p.  141.) Current projections
are that around 3 percent of GDP will go for defense in 1998.
(Department of Defense, National Defense Budget Estimates for FY 1994
(Washington, D.C.:  Department of Defense, 1993), p.  141; and
Department of Defense, "FY 1994 Defense Budget Begins New Era," News
Release No.  126-93, March 27, 1993.) Defense spending peaked in 1989
at $285.9 billion (in 1987 dollars), and under the Clinton budget will
fall to about $185 billion (also in 1987 dollars) in 1998. (The figure
for 1989 was obtained from Department of Defense, National Defense
Budget Estimates for FY 1994 (Washington, D.C.:  Department of
Defense, 1993), p.  129.  The 1998 figure was calculated by taking the
1998 outlay figure for defense provided by the Department of Defense
and deflating it according to the Department's own deflators.) Thus,
the government will spend 35 percent less in 1998 than in 1989.
Compared with the post-World War II drawdown, the current decline in
the defense budget will result in nowhere near the level of the
economic dislocations seen the late 1940s.
<P>

The Impact on the Armed Forces
<P>
     The true measure of whether a defense policy protects national
security adequately is not how much is spent on defense, but rather
whether the armed forces will have the means to fight and win when
conflict arises. From this perspective, Clinton's approach is
alarming. The Bush Administration by February 1992 had already
recommended terminating over 100 weapons programs in fiscal years 1991
and 1992. For fiscal 1993, it identified another seventeen programs
for termination. (Department of Defense, "Complete Set of Briefing
Charts on the FY 1993 Budget," 1992.) While it is impossible to
quantify precisely the combat value that has been lost by ending these
programs, the Navy faces the likelihood of not having an all-weather
attack aircraft to replace the aging A-6 Intruder. The Clinton
Administration has not yet announced a complete hit list of programs
beyond those announced by the Bush Administration, but it will include
the A/F-X fighter, the Multi-Role Fighter (MRF) aircraft and the F-16
Falcon fighter. (Secretary of Defense Aspin announced these program
terminations when he announced the findings of the "Bottom-Up Review"
on September 1, 1993, at the Pentagon.)
<P>

The Macroeconomic Impact 
<P>
     What will be the impact of Clinton's defense cuts on the economy
as a whole? What will be the effect on economic growth and employment?
The short answer to these questions is very little.
<P>
     On the spending side, government social spending is a far greater
burden than defense spending. Social and economic spending has jumped
in recent years and is likely to continue to explode. Federal social
and economic spending in fiscal 1993 will amount to $945.8 billion
(current dollars) and absorb over 15 percent of GDP (see Chart 2 on
following page). (Department of Defense, National Defense Budget
Estimates for FY 1994 (Washington, D.C.:  Department of Defense,
1993), p.  127.) By these standards, the most important conversion
problem the Clinton Administration faces is not from a defense economy
to a civilian economy, but from a public-sector welfare economy to one
based on private-sector production.
<P>
     Reductions in defense-sector jobs are likely to be offset by
growth in those in the civilian economy. A study by the Defense Budget
Project estimates that the defense drawdown could eliminate as many as
1.791 million defense sector jobs, both private and public, during the
period from fiscal 1992 through fiscal 1998. (Richard A.  Bitzinger
and Steven Kosiak, Potential Impact of Defense Spending Reductions on
the Defense Related Labor Force By State (Washington, D.C.:  Defense
Budget Project, 1993), p.  3.) This higher estimate constitutes about
1.5 percent of all the jobs in the U.S. as of 1992. But since some of
this job loss will result from retirement and normal attrition, other
sectors of the economy will not have to absorb all these positions to
avoid higher unemployment throughout the entire economy.
<P>
     In terms of growth, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated
that defense cuts smaller than those envisioned by Clinton could
encourage growth after the turn of the decade. As a result, by 2002
the annual gross national product (GNP) could be only 0.6 percent
higher than it otherwise might be. (Congressional Budget Office, "The
Economic Effects of Reduced Defense Spending," February 1992, pp. 
13-14.) 
<P>
     The upshot is clear: Clinton is wrong to assert that defense is
an unacceptable burden on the U.S. economy. His defense conversion
program thus becomes little more than a thinly veiled attempt to craft
a government industrial policy. 

<P>
The Impact on the Military Industrial Economy 
<P>
     While the curtailment of defense spending will have only a
marginal impact on the economy as a whole, its impact on the defense
industrial sector will be severe. In addition to the procurement cuts,
Clinton plans to lower the research and development account to $38.6
billion in 1994 (1994 dollars) from a 1985 high of $41.5 billion (also
1994 dollars). (Ibid.) In all, procurement and research and
development under the 1994 Clinton budget will be only 45 percent in
real terms of what it was in 1985 (see Chart 3).
<P>
     As a result of these cuts, U.S. defense industries could lose as
many as 1.052 million people in the period 1992 through 1998 because
of the drawdown. (Richard A.  Bitzinger and Steven Kosiak, Potential
Impact of Defense Spending Reductions on the Defense Related Labor
Force By State (Washington, D.C.:  Defense Budget Project, 1993), p. 
3.) In 1992, these industries employed 2.761 million people. (Ibid.)
Thus, employment in defense industries could fall by as much as 48
percent during this period.

<P>
PRESERVING AMERICA'S MILITARY INDUSTRIAL BASE
<P>
     Maintaining America's military strength requires a strong
military industrial base that can produce a sufficient number of
modern weapons to sustain the U.S. armed forces during combat. The
Clinton Administration risks undermining the industrial base through
defense budget reductions that not only are too deep, but too focused
on decreasing the procurement budget for the purchase of weapons and
equipment. America's soldiers, sailors, and airmen will pay a steep
price in future conflicts as result of this policy. A more sensible
policy would be to:
<P>
Concentrate long-range defense planning above all on the industrial
needs of the armed forces and not on converting the defense industrial
base to civilian production. 
<P>
     The best measure of whether the nation is managing its military
industrial base appropriately is whether its armed forces receive the
latest in technology. Reagan's emphasis on the technological
modernization of the armed forces led directly to the quick victory
and low casualties in the Persian Gulf War.
<P>
     The Clinton Administration should focus on producing weapons that
are now in research and development and represent the next generation
of weapons capability. Some of these are the CVN-76 aircraft carrier,
the V-22 Osprey transport aircraft, the F-22 advanced tactical
fighter, the Light-weight Exoatmospheric Projectile (LEAP) anti-
missile interceptor, the Theater High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD)
missile system, the Brilliant Eyes sensor satellite, and the dual-use
Single-Stage Rocket Technology (SSRT) space launch system. These
cutting-edge systems may provide the margin of victory needed in
America's next war. Redirecting the funding in this way will help fund
a new generation of weapons to be put in the hands of America's
soldiers, sailors, and airmen, while at the same time maintaining the
military industrial base. 
<P>
Eliminate the $20 billion defense conversion program. 
<P>
     The Clinton defense conversion program offers $20 billion in
financial incentives to individuals, businesses, and local governments
that are adversely affected by defense budget reductions. This
approach will cause inestimable damage to the defense sector of the
economy by encouraging defense firms to abandon defense production.
<P>
     This $20 billion can be put to better use. It can be recycled
into the procurement account of the defense budget to build new
weapons and equipment, thereby improving the combat capability of the
U.S. armed forces.
<P>
     Even on its own terms, the Clinton defense conversion program is
likely to be a failure. Its central goal is to induce defense
contractors to diversify into non-defense fields. But many defense
companies are already diversified. Further diversification is not
always the best solution for defense companies seeking to adjust to a
reduced defense market. Some defense companies are not well positioned
to penetrate an already saturated consumer market. Others have
invested heavily in products that are unique to defense, and if forced
from the defense business, will lose their investments. Defense
companies should seek solutions that best suit their needs. The
government has no way of knowing what these needs are.
<P>
Focus defense planning on the building and buying of the next
generation of weapons. 
<P>
     Implicit in Clinton's defense plan is the assumption that a high
technology force can be maintained through research and development
alone, without actually buying the weapons systems. This is deceptive,
for three reasons:
<P>
1) Not all advances in weapons technology are derived from research
     and development. Many breakthroughs are realized through the
     production and deployment cycles, particularly those related to
     efficient and reliable production. For example, fighter aircraft
     produced at the end of a production run are frequently more
     reliable and cheaper because of what has been learned by the
     manufacturer in the course of production.
<P>
2) Weapons systems that are in the development stage cannot be used
     effectively in combat. For example, a prototype tank may
     represent the cutting edge in armored technology, but it is of
     little use if not enough have been produced for use in combat and
     if it has not been available to troops for training.
<P>
3) A policy that emphasizes research and development at the expense of
     procurement will undermine production capabilities and the
     industrial base. The sustained production capability needed to
     turn out large numbers of a weapons system cannot be maintained
     if the Pentagon has only prototype models. For example, the C-17
     transport aircraft prototype cost over $1 billion to produce. The
     production models will cost about $300 million each, depending on
     the number purchased. Given the unpredictable nature of regional
     crises, which will be the primary concern of the U.S. military in
     the future, weapons that are not already in production cannot be
     manufactured in large enough numbers to support large combat
     operations. 
<P>
     Furthermore, sharp cuts in procurement funding will adversely
affect the production of existing weapons systems. For example, tight
budgets raise the question of whether to upgrade existing weapons,
such as the F-14 Tomcat fighter aircraft, or to build new systems,
such as the AFX aircraft now in development. Moreover, budget
pressures are forcing decisions to curtail the procurement of existing
weapons systems. The Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS) and the F-16
Falcon fighter jet are two such systems. But ending production
prematurely may result in a gap in military capabilities as older
systems are retired before the new systems are ready. Besides, once a
decision is made to stop the production of a weapon, the capability to
produce it quickly atrophies. Production line employees are laid off,
the tooling is discarded, and managers are assigned to new tasks.
<P>
     The most disturbing problem associated with sharp reductions in
procurement funding, however, is that it may force the Pentagon to
cancel new weapons programs altogether. The Clinton Administration has
not yet announced a complete list of the new programs it plans to
terminate. The casualty list is likely to be long and is certain to
include the A/F-X aircraft and the Multi-Role Fighter (MRF) aircraft
now in development. As assaults on the procurement budget force
decisions to withhold the production of new weapons, the industrial
base is weakened. The effort to maintain a modern military is likewise
weakened. This is why money restored to the defense budget from
defense conversion should be targeted to the procurement account.
<P>
Give governmental support to specific defense industries only as a
last resort.
<P>
     Even if all of the $20 billion Clinton has earmarked for defense
conversion is returned to military modernization programs, some vital
defense sectors -- nuclear shipbuilding, for example -- may be in
danger of disappearing. This result is predictable for areas where the
perceived threat is limited for the near term. But because the near-
term threat is diminished, it does not mean that the military
capability to counter that threat will never again be needed. For
example, the primary mission for Navy attack submarines during the
Cold War was defending against Soviet submarines armed with submarine-
launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs). That mission is less important
today. However, as hostile Third World countries capable of
challenging vital American interests obtain their own submarines, the
U.S. will have to retain a submarine force to deal with this new
threat. For example, Iran has taken delivery of two submarines from
Russia and could challenge U.S. access to Middle East oil. Given poor
planning and reduced defense budgets, however, there may be no nuclear
submarine manufacturers in business when the Navy needs to replace its
aging fleet of attack submarines.
<P>
     Thus the Navy should continue building a third Seawolf submarine,
even though there is little near-term military justification for doing
so. The reason: to keep the shipbuilding capability intact until the
Navy is ready to build its new submarine Centurion. 

<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
     The nation's military industrial base does not exist to bolster
the nation's economy. Nor does it exist to expand employment
opportunities. Its purpose is to provide the U.S. with the world's
strongest, most well-armed military. 
<P>
     President Clinton should remember these truths when formulating
his defense plans. Clinton's defense conversion plan will decimate the
defense industrial base of this country. A strong military industrial
base is built carefully over a long period of time. While it can be
dismantled quickly, it is not easily rebuilt. Ultimately, the price
will be paid when President Clinton, or more likely a future
President, is required to order the American military into battle
without the most modern technology or without an adequate number of
weapons and equipment. The nation learned a grim lesson when it
disarmed too quickly after World Wars I and II. American forces thus
were unprepared for World War II and the Korean War and as a result,
many American lives were needlessly lost. 
<P>
     This is a lesson that Clinton should remember not only the next
time he visits Arlington Cemetery, but the next time he makes a
decision affecting the industrial base of this country.

<title>The Defense Budget for Defense: Why Nunn-Lugar Money Should Go to the B-2

WHY NUNN-LUGAR MONEY SHOULD GO TO THE B-2</H3></i>
<P>

<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Senior Policy Analyst<br>
Executive Memorandum No. 424<br>
August 1, 1995<br>
</center><hr size =3 width =30%>
<P>
    Common sense dictates that the money the government provides to the defense account should
be used to improve America's military capabilities. As with many other things in Washington,
however, common sense does not apply. The defense account is riddled with programs that are either
tangential or completely unrelated to improving America's military capabilities. One is the Nunn-Lugar program to fund the dismantling of weapons on the territory of the former Soviet Union.
<P>
    Later this week, the Senate is likely to begin considering the Defense Authorization Bill for
Fiscal Year 1996 (S. 1026). Included in the bill is an additional $365 million for the Nunn-Lugar
program in fiscal 1996. However, the same bill provides no money to preserve the option of buying
additional B-2 Spirit bombers. More of these bombers will be needed to address both conventional
and strategic threats. Why should the Senate spend money on questionable foreign programs while
depriving the military of even the option of buying more of the most capable bombers ever produced? 
<p>
    Nunn-Lugar is a foreign aid program. The Nunn-Lugar program has been useful in
signaling the new regimes in Russia and other former Soviet states that the United States does not
view them as enemies. Further, it has demonstrated that the U.S. is prepared to make material
assistance available in order to ease tensions.
<p>
    Nevertheless, there are several outstanding questions about the program's effectiveness. The
report to accompany the House version of the Department of Defense Authorization Bill states that
the Administration cannot confirm the proper use of assistance already provided to Russian and other
officials. In fact, the General Accounting Office (GAO) alleges that Nunn-Lugar money has been
used by individuals and institutions working to create new weapons of mass destruction. For example,
the U.S. has committed $46 million to the International Science and Technology Center in Moscow.
The center is designed to employ scientists and engineers, formerly working on weapons projects, in
peaceful pursuits. GAO determined that some of these scientists and engineers are continuing their
weapons-related activities, working for the center only part of the time. If this proves true, the money
will have been used to subsidize the salaries of those working to develop new weapons of mass
destruction. 
<p>
    Regardless of the merits of the Nunn-Lugar program, the question arises as to why it should
be funded out of the defense account. Nunn-Lugar is not a defense program; it is a foreign aid
program. The proper manager of foreign aid programs is the Department of State, not the Department
of Defense. Further, the proper pool of funds from which Nunn-Lugar should be financed is the
foreign aid account, not the defense account.
<p>
    The B-2, a major leap forward in capabilities. The Senate defense bill's funding of the
Nunn-Lugar program becomes even more questionable when the same bill denies funds to maintain
the option of buying more B-2 bombers. The B-2 is needed to fulfill both strategic nuclear and
conventional roles. Its conventional capabilities are particularly important. This sophisticated aircraft
will allow the U.S. to penetrate the airspace of a future regional aggressor, similar to Iraq in the
Persian Gulf War, and destroy the command and control centers such a country's leaders need to
direct their military forces.
<p>
    More B-2s also will be essential to maintain a balanced and capable bomber force. In its 1993
Bottom-Up Review and 1994 Nuclear Posture Review, the Clinton Administration claimed that it
needed up to 184 bombers to perform necessary missions. But this estimate is based on the
assumption that during conventional conflicts bombers can be swung from one combat theater, say in
East Asia, to another, such as the Persian Gulf. Many experts question the wisdom of this "swing
strategy."  In reality, there is no guarantee that the requirements for bomber operations in the first
theater will lessen as they become pressing in the second. Another mistaken assumption by the
Administration is that the B-52 bomber force will meet America's long-term bomber requirements.
The B-52s will be approaching 60 years of age by that time and will be far too old to provide an
effective combat capability, even in conventional conflicts.
<p>
    Finally, the B-2 will be needed to deter Russia's nuclear forces. The backbone of Russia's
future strategic arsenal will be the SS-25 Sickle intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), which is
deployed on mobile launchers. While not yet capable of doing so, an upgraded B-2 could be the only
strategic offensive weapon system able to hold the SS-25 at risk.
<p>
    The B-2 bomber is a major leap forward. It can penetrate the most advanced air defenses and
deliver precision-guided munitions against important military targets. It provides global reach and
reduces dramatically the number of men placed in harm's way compared with other aircraft for
similar missions. Given these capabilities, a decision to forgo even the option of buying more B-2
bombers is dangerously short-sighted.
<p>

<b>Modifying the Defense Authorization Bill</b>
<p>
Given the situation it now faces, the Senate needs to modify the Defense Authorization Bill to
preserve America's military capabilities. It could do so by:
<p><ul>
<li> Deleting Nunn-Lugar funds from the bill. The Nunn-Lugar program is a foreign aid program and
does not belong in the defense account, particularly because it robs money from critical defense
programs.

<li> Using the money saved from the Nunn-Lugar program to maintain the option of buying more
B-2 bombers. Eliminating Nunn-Lugar funding from the bill will make $365 million available to
support the B-2 procurement option. The B-2 program requires $553 million. The remaining $188
million can come from other provisions in the bill that have little or nothing to do with defense. These
include the land mine clearing assistance program ($20 million), support for the Atlanta Olympic
Games ($15 million), weather reconnaissance ($20 million), the Defense Business Management
University ($89 million), and counter-drug activities of the Department of Defense ($44 million).

<li> Reserving the option of restoring some or all of the funding for Nunn-Lugar during
consideration of foreign assistance legislation. A strong argument can be made for a well-run
assistance program to dismantle weapons of mass destruction on the territory of the former Soviet
Union. If the Senate considers a foreign assistance authorization bill later this year, this will provide
an ideal vehicle for extending authorization of the Nunn-Lugar program through the foreign assistance
account. But this funding should be provided only after it has been proven that abuses have not been
committed and that the program is functioning as intended.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<p>
    The defense budget should not be used to fund programs that have little or nothing to do with
improving military capabilities, especially when vital defense programs like the B-2 bomber program
go underfunded. The Nunn-Lugar program to assist Russia and other states of the former Soviet
Union with the destruction of weapons is such a non-defense program. There may be a good
argument for continuing the Nunn-Lugar program, but it should be made during consideration of
foreign aid legislation. In the meantime, the dollars from the defense budget the Nunn-Lugar program
would have consumed should be used to preserve the option of procuring more B-2 bombers.

<H3><I> DEFENSE FREEZE WOULD HARM NATIONAL SECURITY </I></H3>

Backgrounder Update #244<br>
March 31, 1995<br>
(Updating Backgrounder Update No.  242, "Clinton's Defense Budget Falls Far Short Again," March 7, 1995)<br>

</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>

     On March 19, the Chairman of the House Budget Committee,
Representative John Kasich of Ohio, appeared on NBC News' Sunday talk
show "Meet the Press."  When asked about defense spending, he suggested
that he might be willing to support a freeze on defense budget outlays over
the next five years.  This would mean that defense spending would not be
adjusted for inflation, which would result in around a 15 percent real
reduction in spending over five years.  Such a freeze, if it were to become
the official proposal of the Budget Committee, would be alarming.  It
would, in fact, harm U.S.  national security.  A defense freeze would not
even fund President Bill Clinton's proposed military force, which most
experts agree will not be able to win two regional wars "nearly
simultaneously" as advertised in the Pentagon's "bottom-up" review.  The
inevitable result of a defense freeze would be the reduction of U.S.  military
commitments overseas and the inability to defend U.S.  national security
interests. 
<P>
      It becomes clear, upon examination of the facts about the defense
budget and national security, that a defense freeze that fails to account for
inflation is based on erroneous assumptions.  Policymakers need to be
apprised of these facts in order to make sound judgments about the level of
defense spending this nation needs.
<P>
     FACT #1:  The currently estimated budget authority for defense
in fiscal year 1995, in real terms, will be 35 percent below what it was
ten years ago.
<P>
     When it comes to contributing toward deficit reduction, the defense
program gave at the office.  No other broad category of spending can make
this claim.  Under proposed Clinton budgets, entitlement spending will
increase by 38 percent and domestic discretionary spending by 12 percent
in real terms, while defense will decline by 35 percent during the 1990s. 
Proponents of a defense freeze apparently think that the Clinton approach
is on target because a defense freeze would result in an outlay level for
defense in fiscal year 2000 that is only one percent higher than the
Administration's.  While advocates of a defense freeze would spend more
than Clinton on defense in the next five years, they may settle for Clinton
levels in the years after the five-year period.  The implication is inescapable: 
If a defense freeze were approved, the Republican majority in Congress will
have settled for a long-range national defense strategy defined by a
Democratic President.
<P>

FACT #2:  The Clinton Administration's defense budget underfunds its
own defense program by over $100 billion.
<P>
     The General Accounting Office (GAO) released a study last year
estimating that the Clinton Administration's defense program for fiscal years
1995-1999 is underfunded by $150 billion in budget authority.  Several
months earlier, The Heritage Foundation estimated the shortfall at roughly
$100 billion.  Estimates for fiscal years 1996-2000 reveal the same general
level of shortfall.  Since a defense freeze would not make up for these
shortfalls, its proponents must accept Clinton's Bottom-Up Review at its
word or admit that the defense freeze is not enough.  But no reputable
defense analyst believes the Bottom-Up Review program is fully funded. 
Therefore, the only available course will be to cut weapons, force structure,
and readiness in the outyears as it becomes clear that there is not enough
money to pay for the force. 
<P>
      What programs are proponents of a defense freeze willing to cut
from the Bottom-Up Review program?  How far down are they willing to
go to accommodate a defense freeze?  Will they reduce the Army to fewer
than the equivalent of 15 divisions the Clinton Administration says is
needed?  Will they reduce the Air Force to fewer than the 20 tactical fighter
wings recommended in the Bottom-Up Review?  Do they favor a Navy with
fewer than the 346 ships recommended by the Bottom-Up Review?  These
are the practical implications of the defense freeze ideal, as they are of the
Clinton Administration's proposal.  Given the Clinton defense budget's $100
billion shortfall, force structure is certain to be scaled back if the budget
remains at current levels.  The defense freeze ultimately will lead a
Republican Congress to accept a smaller and weaker military than even the
Clinton Administration claims it wants.
<P>
FACT #3:  The Department of Defense has cut over one million
personnel in the last ten years.
<P>
     The Pentagon has reduced its personnel by about 25 percent since
1985.  This includes both civilian and military employees.  Active-duty
military personnel alone have been reduced by an average of over 5,000
persons per month over the last ten years.  No other federal government
agency has shed its employees at such a rate.  Often ridiculed as a bloated
bureaucracy, the Pentagon actually has been shrinking rapidly, and this has
led to the very efficiencies Kasich and others charge need to be instituted
at the Department of Defense.  The result:  25 percent fewer people now are
performing national security tasks in a world where the threat has changed
but America's global commitments remain undiminished.
<P>
FACT #4:  By the end of the current fiscal year, the military force
structure will be reduced by 30 percent from 1988 levels.
<P>
     Just as military personnel levels have been reduced, so has the size
of the armed forces.  The Army fielded 28 divisions at the end of fiscal
1988; by the end of fiscal 1995, it will retain only 20 division equivalents. 
Whereas the Air Force possessed almost 38 tactical fighter wings in 1988,
it now is down to around 20 wings.  The Navy had a fleet of 566 ships at
the end of fiscal 1988; by the end of fiscal 1995, it will have only 373
ships. 
<P>
      To be sure, the end of the Cold War required reductions of force
levels, but to go any farther is to deny this nation the ability to win the wars
of the post-Cold War era.  The shrinkage has been so severe that many even
doubt the planned force can fulfill the Clinton Administration's assigned
mission of fighting and winning two overlapping major regional conflicts. 
Lawmakers and Administration officials alike should declare officially that
the post-Cold War demobilization is over and that America needs to think
more seriously about the kinds of military forces it needs to maintain its
strength and military commitments abroad.
<P>
FACT #5:  A defense freeze could result in a 15 percent loss of buying
power by military personnel at the end of the decade.
<P>
     Since a defense freeze would bar adjustments for inflation, the
Pentagon would be faced with a choice:  Either cut military pay, which will
not be adjusted for inflation, or pay for salary increases out of other
accounts, such as readiness or procurement.  If pay were not adjusted for
inflation for five years, the nation's soldiers and sailors would lose 15
percent of their purchasing power.  The Clinton Administration tried to
forego a military pay adjustment in 1994, but Congress refused.  The same
thing would happen again if the Pentagon, trying to accommodate a defense
budget freeze, froze military pay.  Faced with congressional opposition, the
Pentagon simply would raid other accounts for money.
<P>
FACT #6:  Procurement funding has been reduced by over 70 percent
in real terms since 1985.
<P>
     Proponents of a defense freeze may believe that they can increase
military pay by cutting procurement funding.  Indeed, Chairman Kasich
talked about procurement reform in the context of possible savings during
his "Meet the Press" interview.  While the Chairman is correct in asserting
that there is a need for procurement reform, it is not wise to pay for salary
increases by taking funding away from procurement accounts.  Put simply,
the turnip of procurement already has been bled dry.  Procurement funding
has been reduced by 70 percent since 1985; another 10 percent would
sentence the military to continuing to buy new weapons in extremely limited
numbers throughout the next five years.  For example, the Navy procured
29 ships in 1985; in fiscal 1996, it will procure only seven.  A defense
freeze means the Navy will purchase no more than this number of ships
annually.
<P>
FACT #7:  A defense freeze would deny any new defense initiatives.
<P>
     Many in Congress do not consider the Clinton defense program the
last word on national security.  They wish to support new initiatives that the
Clinton Administration either has not proposed or has opposed.  One such
initiative is the development and deployment of a national missile defense
system.  A defense freeze would leave no room for such initiatives.  If the
defense budget were frozen at current levels, the nation would not be able
to build an effective defense against ballistic missile attack.
<P>
Conclusion
<P>
     The Department of Defense should not be criticized for contributing
to the budget crisis.  In fact, it should be hailed as a model for deficit
reduction.  If only the Department of Housing and Urban Development or
the Department of Health and Human Services were reducing its personnel
by 25 percent.  The nation need not spend more than is necessary on
national security, but it must at least spend the minimum.  To do otherwise
is an abdication of the single most important constitutional duty of the
federal government -- to provide for the national defense.

Preserving American's Military Strength," December 28, 1992.)
<P>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>

     President Clinton's 1995 defense budget, which allocates $1.29
trillion for defense from 1995 through 1999, continues his
Administration's systematic dismantling of the nation's defenses so
painstakingly rebuilt by Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. (All figures are
for budget authority, the amount the Pentagon is authorized to spend
for a given period, as opposed to outlays, or the amount actually
spent.) In the Clinton plan, the Department of Defense will fall short
of its funding requirements -- as outlined in the Administration's own
"Bottom-Up Review" -- by nearly $100 billion. The Administration and
Congress must stop looking for "savings" in the defense budget, which
has paid more than its share in cost-cutting efforts by three
Administrations since the Reagan build-up peaked in 1985.
<P>
     To be sure, Clinton slightly raised this year's defense budget by
$1.8 billion. (This quote comes from the transcript of the budget
briefing included in the package of materials accompanying the
Department of Defense News Release No. 043-94, February 7, 1994.)
However, when adjusted for inflation, the 1995 defense budget still
shows a decline of 0.9 percent. This is the tenth straight year of
declining defense budgets. Furthermore, the budget will decline in
inflation-adjusted terms in each of the next four years beyond fiscal
1995. Thus, the Clinton Administration is now committed to fourteen
years of uninterrupted decline in the defense budget. 
<P>
     This year's defense budget will harm national security. In every
category -- force structure, modernization, combat readiness, and
maintaining the quality of military personnel -- the amount to be
spent is based not on how much defense is needed, but on budgetary
considerations. National security policy is not being made based on
threats identified by Clinton's national security advisers, but on
spending caps provided by his budget advisers, most of whom have no
knowledge of America's defense requirements. This approach represents
an abdication by Clinton of his highest constitutional priority: to
provide for the nation's defense. 
<P>
     The Clinton budget will lead to several damaging outcomes. They
are:
<P>
A force that is too small to defend America's interests. The Clinton
     Administration, on September 1, 1993, adopted a blueprint for
     America's future forces. The plan was the result of a
     comprehensive study of defense policy called the "Bottom-Up
     Review." It called for a force in 1999 of 15 Army divisions, 346
     Navy ships, 20 Air Force tactical wings, and 174,000 active-duty
     Marines. But it is now clear that the Clinton Administration has
     no intention of meeting these goals. The Clinton 1995 defense
     budget has nowhere near the money required to support this plan.
     (The assessment that the Clinton Administration's defense budget
     is too small to support its own force structure plan is shared by
     opinion leaders across the political spectrum. Editorialists at
     The New York Times, for example, on January 28, 1994, argued: "As
     Mr. Clinton must know, these [Bottom-Up Review] force levels --
     which Congressional Republicans are sure to support -- will end
     up costing far more than his proposed $260-billion-a-year budgets
     over the next five years.") The Bottom-Up Review Force (BURF)
     will require about $1.39 trillion for the five-year period
     covering fiscal years 1995 through 1999. (For a full assessment
     of the Bottom-Up Review, see Lawrence T. Di Rita, et al., "Thumbs
     Down To The Bottom-Up Review," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder
     No. 957, September 22, 1993.) Since the Clinton 1995 budget
     allocates only $1.29 trillion, the President is $100 billion
     short of his target. 
<P>
     This shortfall cannot be a surprise to the Administration,
because the procedure used to calculate it was used by former Defense
Secretary Les Aspin to criticize George Bush's defense proposals in
1992, when Aspin was Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.
The BURF most closely resembles what then-Congressman Aspin called his
"Option C." Option C provided the foundation for the defense budget
Congress drafted in 1992. Aspin estimated that Option C would cost
$270 billion in current dollar budget authority in fiscal year 1997.
(Les Aspin, "Defense 1997 Alternatives," February 25, 1992.)
<P>
     But the BURF, which Clinton has said will cost just $252 billion
in 1997, is larger than Option C. For example, Option C provides for
only 137,000 active-duty Marines, while the BURF provides for 174,000.
Further, while Option C planned for 18 Air Force fighter wings, the
BURF calls for 20. Taking the cost of the slightly larger BURF into
account, and using Aspin's own cost calculating procedures, the BURF
should cost about $275 billion in 1997. But the Clinton budget
provides only $252 billion in 1997, thus revealing a one-year budget
gap of $23 billion. Over the entire five-year period from 1995 through
1999, the shortfall is close to $100 billion.
<P>
     Since that is the case, the Clinton defense budget will result in
a force that is far smaller than the BURF. This force will resemble
another force described by Aspin called "Option B." Option B calls for
just 12 Army divisions, 290 Navy ships, 14 Air Force tactical wings,
and 134,000 active duty Marines . (Ibid.) A force this small could not
address the two "nearly simultaneous" major regional conflicts that
the Bottom-Up Review states must be addressed to protect the nation's
vital interests in the post-Cold War world.
<P>
A "hollow" military that is not combat ready. The Clinton defense
     budget, when coupled with the force structure decisions made in
     the Bottom-Up Review, will damage the ability of the military to
     stay ready for combat. To meet the austere budget goals, the
     military services will have to cut funding for the operations,
     maintenance, modernization, and training needed to stay ready for
     war.
<P>
     The damage to military readiness caused by the competition for
dollars is already evident. For 1994, the Army estimates that it can
pay for just over half (58 percent) of scheduled equipment overhauls.
(Memorandum from Acting Secretary of the Army John W. Shannon to
Secretary of Defense Les Aspin, June 15, 1993. Reprinted in Inside the
Pentagon, June 24, 1993, pp. 7-8.) Ammunition supplies, a critical
indicator of readiness, are also declining due to budget reductions.
The Army is now consuming ammunition out of its war supply for
training purposes. Only 15 percent of the Army's ammunition is
certified as war-ready, based on shelf-life and other factors.
(Briefing by the Munitions Industrial Base Task Force at The Heritage
Foundation, February 15, 1994.) Finally, the Pentagon's own outside
group assessing military readiness, called the Readiness Task Force,
has determined that the frequency and length of Marine Corps
deployments overseas is preventing Corps units from participating in
required training activities. (Department of Defense, "Defense Science
Board Task Force on Readiness Interim Report," February 14, 1994, p.
6. Also see "Readiness Task Force Releases Interim Report," Department
of Defense News Release No. 081-94, February 18, 1994.)
<P>
     To reverse this disturbing trend in readiness, the Administration
is proposing to increase operations and maintenance funding in fiscal
1995 by $4.9 billion from 1994 levels. But this one-time infusion of
money will prove inadequate to avoid the emerging crisis in readiness.
There are two reasons for this conclusion: 
<P>
Reason #1: Clinton's approach amounts to no more than a budget "shell
     game" in which too little money is moved around between accounts.
     In future years, for example, military pay will demand larger
     percentages of the defense budget. This is because the number of
     troops in Clinton's force structure plan remains relatively high
     compared with the equipment purchases and operating costs
     provided in the budget. If the budget is to remain at the
     inadequate levels proposed by Clinton, then these other accounts
     will have to fall as military pay begins to consume a larger
     share of the total. In short, the reallocation of funds between
     accounts cannot solve the basic problem of an underfunded
     military force.
<P>
Reason #2: This reallocation of funds is also coming at the price of
     further reductions in the procurement budget. Reductions of the
     procurement account mean that the military will be operating
     aging equipment. For example, M-1 Abrams tank production ceased
     in the middle of 1993. As a result, the average age of the M-1
     fleet will go from 5.1 years in 1990 to 9.4 years in 1995, and to
     13.4 years in 1999. This is certain to result in increases in the
     cost of maintaining the fleet during the remaining years of this
     decade and into the next. Thus, the slashing of modernization
     funds also results in greater costs for programs under the
     Operations and Maintenance account.
<P>
     A posture that leaves the United States, its allies, and forces
abroad vulnerable to missile strikes. The Clinton Administration's
assault on the nation's missile defense program continues unabated
with the 1995 budget. The budget request includes only $3.25 billion
for the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization (BMDO) in fiscal 1995.
This compares to $7.6 billion that the Bush Administration planned to
propose for this program. Further, the budget demonstrates that the
Administration is even abandoning its own missile defense plan for the
period from fiscal 1995 through 1999, which was formulated during the
Bottom-Up Review. This longer-term plan already imposed a $22.9
billion, or 56 percent, cut in the program. Now the Administration is
saying that even the $18 billion that remains is too much. Another
$1.1 billion has been eliminated from the five-year budge.
<P>
     The impact of these budget proposals on the program will end the
prospects for effective national missile defense. The territory of the
United States will remain vulnerable to long-range missile strikes. As
former Secretary of Defense Les Aspin stated last year, the so-called
theater missile threat is "here and now." (Secretary Aspin made this
comment during a press briefing on May 13, 1993, at the Pentagon.)
Furthermore, Clinton's budget proposal is too low to field defenses
against short-range (theater) missiles, despite earlier assertions by
Secretary Aspin that such defenses are a priority. (Ibid.) The Clinton
Administration plans to allocate only about $2 billion for theater
missile defense in fiscal 1995. The Bush Administration would have
budgeted almost $3.1 billion for the same period. This will certainly
delay the deployment of effective theater missile defenses and make
the systems that are ultimately deployed less effective. The question
that remains is how vulnerable will U.S. and allied forces be to enemy
missile strikes in places like Korea?
<P>
A technology gap. The Clinton Administration's defense budget
     represents a massive assault on the Pentagon's funding for new
     equipment and systems. The procurement budget will, in fiscal
     1995, fall by $1.2 billion from the year before. This inflation
     adjusted decline of 5.4 percent means that in 1995 the
     procurement budget will be only one-third of what it was in 1985.
     These budget reductions are already having an impact. Whereas the
     Pentagon bought 29 ships, 943 aircraft, and 720 tanks in 1985, it
     will buy only six ships, 127 aircraft, and no tanks in fiscal
     1995 (see chart on following page). The Army alone is planning to
     terminate 57 programs.
<P>
     Another trouble spot is research and development (R&D). The R&D
budget is slated to receive a modest 1 percent real increase (after
inflation) in 1995. Unfortunately, in the previous year's budget, a
similar attempt to protect R&D was rejected by Congress, which voted
to decrease it by about 10 percent. There is no reason to believe that
this pattern will not continue during debate on the fiscal 1995
defense budget. (For a full discussion on relationship between
procurement and research and development, see John F. Luddy, "Stop The
Slide Toward a Hollow Military, Heritage Foundation Backgrounder
Update No. 209, January 14, 1994.)
<P>
     Taken together, the Administration's proposed funding plans for
procurement and research and development will endanger the military's
ability to arm itself with modern, high technology weapons. This will
result in a technology gap because existing military systems -- the
Navy's A-6 Intruder all-weather attack bomber, for example -- will
have to be retired before new systems can be developed and purchased.
This technology gap will certainly result in higher U.S. casualties in
a future conflict.
<P>
A damaged military industrial base. The steep reductions in the
     Administration's budget for defense procurement will not only
     prevent the military from obtaining high technology in the near
     future, it will also result in a depleted industrial base
     incapable of producing adequate numbers of high-tech weapons over
     the longer term. For example, the Clinton budget may result in
     the loss of around one million defense-related jobs in the
     private sector. (Richard A. Bitzinger and Steve Kosiak, Potential
     Impact of Defense Spending Reductions on the Defense Related
     Labor Force By State (Washington, D.C.: Defense Budget Project,
     1993), p. 3.) In addition to lost jobs will be lost capabilities
     in defense production. Large defense contractors are cutting back
     on the number of smaller industries they rely on as suppliers.
     For example, Douglas Aircraft Company's list of suppliers dropped
     by 75 percent from early 1992 to the end of 1993. (Anthony L.
     Velocci, "U.S. Shakeout Tests Suppliers' Flexibility," Aviation
     Week & Space Technology, February 14, 1994, pp. 48-51.) Lockheed
     Corporation's Fort Worth Division has likewise reduced its list
     of suppliers by 68 percent. (Ibid.) Rebuilding this supplier
     network will take considerable time; something that may not be
     available in the event of a crisis.
<P>
     The Clinton Administration is compounding the problems associated
with the weakening of the military industrial base. It is proposing to
allocate $3.3 billion of the defense budget in fiscal 1995 to "defense
conversion." This is part of a $20 billion multi-year, government-wide
program. The defense conversion program is designed to push industrial
enterprises out of the defense sector. This policy is misdirected
because it will not save any money. Instead, it directs that the
Pentagon actually pay for a weakening of the industrial base upon
which it depends. The $3.3 billion in the fiscal year 1995 defense
budget allocated to defense conversion would be better spent on
procurement. (For a full discussion of the defense industrial base and
defense conversion, see Baker Spring, "Supporting The Force: The
Industrial Base and Defense Conversion," Heritage Foundation
Backgrounder No. 964, October 22, 1993.)

<P>
CONCLUSION
<P>
     Any President's budget is a document that reflects policy
options. President Clinton's fiscal 1995 budget is no exception, and
it shows the low priority he gives to national security issues. In his
budget, defense spending will go down while both entitlement spending
and domestic discretionary spending will increase. It exposes serious
contradictions in the Administration's defense policy, such as the
mismatch between force size and funding and the overemphasis on
reductions in procurement funding. 
<P>
     President Clinton must end this policy of neglect toward national
security. The nation's defenses must be given a higher priority than
the Clinton budget implies. The Administration must acknowledge the
full extent of its defense budget gap -- nearly $100 billion -- and
start working with Congress to find the funds from other budgets to
pay for it.

<title>Teens, big business and the politics of sex</title>
<body>
<p>
<center><h2>Teens, big business and the politics of sex</h2></center>
<p>
<h4>There's a lot at stake in hyped figures about teen's sexual
activity, but millions of virgins are alive and well out there,
too.</h4>
<p>
&quot;Hello, Family Research Council?  I'm a producer
for the noon and 9 <i>News on 10 </i>- network affiliate and all
that - and I'm looking for a virgin.&quot;
<p>
&quot;A virgin?&quot;
<p>
&quot;Yes, we heard that you might know one, if you can believe
this - ah, one that's over 18 and, ah, never had any intercourse.
<p>
&quot;We like to do television on oddities.  You know the format,
satanist accountants and IRS audit trend lines...the missing link
in Manhattan...
<p>
 &quot;And we heard that there were actually people claiming to
be virgins.  We though that went out in 1952 with a woman in Montana
named Ethel.&quot;
<p>
 A lot of people are &quot;discovering&quot; virginity as the
new minority class, thanks to the efforts of people like Rep.
Pat Schroeder, D-Colo., and her associates, who are working hard
to convince Americans that 80% of teens are actively engaged in
sex and pursuing many alternative lifestyles.
<p>
 In mid-April, the committee Schroeder controls in the House called
the federal government's response to rampant teen bed-hopping
a national tragedy. 
<p>
 But the tragedy is that sexual politics is big business in Washington.
<p>
 Schroeder's committee whipped up the 80% figure by adding 20-year-olds
into the mix. 
<p>
 In fact, a study by the Department of Health and Human Services
found that among girls under age 18, almost 65% were virgins.
 In ages 15-19 (a group said to be swarming to the bedroom), almost
50% were still waiting.
<p>
 But while the pro-abortion lobby's numbers are bad, their political
logic is good.  And it will cost taxpayers.  Financial self-interest
is one reason that groups like Planned Parenthood and their patron
saint of federal funding publish inflated numbers.  It's a simple
political formula:
<p>
 A + B = C.
<p>
If most kids have sex - A.<br>
And my programs deal with sexual issues - B.<br>
Then my program needs more tax dollars - C.<br>
<p>
 For all their alleged interest in health, abortion activists
and their business counterparts make hundreds of millions of dollars
annually from the government.
<p>
 Take Planned Parenthood, for example.  According to a 1990 report
in a philanthropic journal, $273 million of the group's $370 million
budget came from public sources.
<p>
 Logic would argue that it's in the abortion lobby's interest
to justify its existence to the governmental overseers who provide
over 70% of their budget.
<p>
 Schroeder's real interests can be clearly seen at budget time.
 In the last cycle, while $150 million went to Title X, the federal
government's contraceptive program, Schroeder fought to kill the
$7.8 million that went to Title XX.  Two-thirds of Title XX goes
to teen parenting and care programs, while the remainder goes
to the only abstinence-based sexual education program in 
the federal budget. 
<p>
 One would think Pat and Planned parenthood would talk constantly
about abstinence - the best way to avoid sexually transmitted
disease and pregnancy.  But if kids really &quot;just said no&quot;
to sex, their golden goose would be cooked.
<p>
 Every day, I talk with people amazed to discover that virgins
are alive and well in North America.  The vast majority of teen-agers
are waiting to have sexual intercourse.  And many others, after
limited experience, choose a lifestyle of abstinence.
<p>
 But don't be surprised that their stories go untold or run as
brief mention under oddities.  The real story behind sexual politics
can be found on an accountant's spread sheet.

<title>Two Cheers For the House Medicare Plan -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3><i>TWO CHEERS FOR THE HOUSE MEDICARE PLAN</i></h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/butler.htm">Stuart M. Butler</a><br>
Vice President and Director of Domestic and Economic Policy Studies<br>
<a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Executive Memorandum No. 428<br>
September 22, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
	The House Medicare reform plan represents a bold step toward the structural changes needed in the program. With some modifications, legislation based on this plan could create a new Medicare program that moderates the growth in costs while giving America's elderly many new choices and much more control over their own health care.
<P>
	The House plan, like legislation recently sponsored in the Senate by Judd Gregg (R-NH), would take some modest steps to reform traditional Medicare while giving seniors the alternative of taking a specified amount of financial assistance and applying it to the purchase of a private plan. Under this alternative, the elderly would be in the driver's seat:  Plans would have compete to be chosen. If a plan did not give good service and value for money, seniors could switch to another during an annual open season.
<p>
	The House plan would set up a system somewhat like the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. The FEHBP covers over 9 million federal workers, including Members of Congress, as well as dependents and retirees. It allows enrollees, once a year, to choose from a wide range of health plans which contain a variety of benefits. These plans compete vigorously to be chosen by enrollees. Since the government pays a percentage of the premiums for FEHBP plans, enrollees save money by picking wisely; and they receive plenty of information from consumer groups, as well as employee and retiree groups, to help them do so. 
<p>
	 The House plan would allow the elderly to remain in traditional Medicare if they wish, but it would make important changes in this part of the program. First, it would maintain Part B premiums at 31.5 percent of total Part B costs, rather than allow them to fall under current law to 25 percent. Second, it would phase out the taxpayer subsidy of Part B premiums entirely for upper income seniors (over $75,000 for singles, $125,000 for couples). Third, it would permit the government to reward seniors who report waste, fraud, and abuse. And fourth, through a "lookback" provision, it would effectively put the traditional program on a fixed budget.
<p>
	<b>Reduced Subsidies.</b> These are welcome changes in the traditional Medicare program, but Congress should go further. Part B of Medicare, which covers principally physician services, is a heavily subsidized voluntary program unconnected to the Part A hospital program financed through payroll taxes. That subsidy should be cut even deeper than the House proposes. The typical enrollee should pay at least 50 percent of the program's cost (the level originally set in 1965), and the threshold for phasing out the subsidy entirely should be lower, perhaps $50,000 for singles and $100,000 for couples. Moreover, the plan would not raise the traditional program's deductibles, which have fallen sharply in real terms over the years. For Part B the deductible is just $100, which encourages excessive use of medical care. This deductible should be at least doubled.
<P>
	<b>Choices for Seniors.</b> The heart of the House plan, however, is a set of provisions that would give seniors the right to pick a private health plan, including a catastrophic plan with a medical savings account (MSA), with the government making a contribution to that plan based on the enrollee's age and other basic risk factors. This option, to be called Medicare Plus, would create a structure much like the FEHBP. Like federal retirees, seniors choosing this option would know that private plans had to meet certain conditions to be permitted to market to the elderly. These conditions would include solvency requirements and consumer protection standards. And these plans could not turn down sicker applicants during the annual open season when plans are selected.
<p>
	Still, some features of Medicare Plus do raise concerns. Examples: <P>

<b>Price Controls.</b> While the lookback provision would set a firm budget for the traditional program, the plan unfortunately would require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to use the failed approach of price controls to try to keep within that budget. It would be better to combine payment changes with increases in deductibles and copayments.
<P>
<b>Standardized Benefits.</b> One requirement on private plans is that they must offer a benefit package at least equal to that of the traditional Medicare program. But this means that a senior normally would face higher costs if he wanted a plan with some benefits not now in Medicare, such as a drug benefit, because he could not substitute that new benefit for an existing one of less value to him. Under the FEHBP, federal workers and retirees have a range of alternative benefits beyond a very small core of required benefits. In restructuring Medicare, Congress should adopt a similar approach. Plans under Medicare Plus not only should be required to contain a small core of benefits (including catastrophic protection not now in the Medicare package), but also should be permitted to offer a wide range of optional additional benefits. This would allow the elderly to pick the packages that are best for them.
<P>
<b>Rigid Copayments.</b> The House proposal appears to require Medicare Plus plans to contain deductibles and copayments no higher than the traditional Medicare program's. This would be a serious mistake and would be financially harmful to the elderly. Competing private plans should be allowed to offer different combinations of deductibles, copayments, and premium prices, as well as varieties of MSAs. Seniors, not Congress, should be allowed to decide which combination is the best value.
<p>
<b>No Level Playing Field.</b> Another concern is that the playing field might not be level between private plans and traditional Medicare. If private plans are to be required to provide consumer information and be solvent, the traditional program should be required to meet the same standards and provide the same consumer information. Seniors should have all the information they need to choose wisely between traditional Medicare and Medicare Plus.
<p>
	These and other problems need to be dealt with, but overall, the House plan indicates that Congress is at last prepared to make the changes needed to stabilize Medicare's finances so that it is still there when today's workers reach retirement. Moreover, by giving seniors the right to choose private plans in roughly the same way that federal workers and retirees routinely do, the proposal would introduce into Medicare the dynamics of the FEHBP:  costs kept down by competing private plans that must give the best value for money to the patient.

A Physicians Council Symposium<br>
<h3>THE MEDICARE DEBATE:<br>
POLITICS, PROCESS, AND PROPOSALS FOR REFORM</h3>
<p>
<a href="#dan">Representative Dan Miller (R-FL)</a><br>
<a href="#grace">Grace-Marie Arnett, The Consensus Group</a><br>
<a href="#john">John C. Liu, The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
Delivered June 13, 1995<p>


<a href="/heritage/staff/truluck.htm">PHIL TRULUCK</a>, Executive Vice President of The Heritage Foundation:  
<p>
	Congressman Dan Miller of Florida is one of the stars among conservative legislators here in Washington. He is in his second term now, and he epitomizes a principled politician. It's a good way to highlight our session here today at the Physicians Council.
<p>
	The Congressman had no previous political experience before he won in 1992. He came up here as a businessman and a college professor. Now he serves on the House Appropriations Committee and the House Budget Committee, which puts him in two good positions to do something about the huge federal budget deficit and federal spending. He represents the thirteenth district of Florida, which is the southwestern part of Florida. Most important, he serves on the Speaker's task force on Medicare reform, working with his fellow Congressmen on this key issue.
<p>
	Also joining us is Grace-Marie Arnett, the President of Arnett & Co., a consulting firm here in Washington, D.C. Grace-Marie, who specializes in health care policy, is also a senior associate with the Domestic Policy Issue Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. She is also a founding member of the Consensus Group of Washington health policy experts who advance ideas on a market-based approach to health care reform. Because of her long-standing interest in tax policy, Grace-Marie Arnett was asked to serve as executive director of the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform, recently formed by Senate leader Robert Dole and House Speaker Newt Gingrich and chaired by Jack Kemp. The 14-member commission expects to issue its recommendation in December 1995. 
<p>
	 And finally, joining us today is John Liu, Health Policy Analyst of The Heritage Foundation. John is a native of California and before coming to Heritage in 1994 served as Legislative Counsel to Congressman Cliff Stearns (R-FL), where he helped to draft the Consumer Choice Health Security Act, the legislative embodiment of The Heritage Foundation's consumer choice health care reform proposal, sponsored by Congressman Stearns and Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma and 24 other Senate cosponsors. John holds a bachelor degree in political science from the University of California at San Diego and a Juris Doctor degree from the Tulane University School of Law in New Orleans, Louisiana.
<p>
	Congressman Miller, please give us your thoughts, and thank you again for joining us.
<p>

<b>THE URGENT NEED TO REFORM MEDICARE</b>
<p>
<a name="dan"></a><b>REPRESENTATIVE DAN MILLER:</b>  Thank you for having me here. My district in Florida has more seniors than any district in the United States:  Sarasota, Sun City, Port Charlotte, Venice. It's a great area to represent.
<P>
	Medicare is really the biggest issue we face this year. It is the biggest issue because of the enormous fiscal pressures if we don't address it. There is one overriding fact:  Medicare is going bankrupt. We have no choice. For health care reasons, it has to be addressed. From a political standpoint, they say this is the third rail of politics:  It will kill you politically. It is a very difficult issue, but we have to do it. Let me share with you some of my thoughts and some of my observations on what we can expect in this process over the next several months.
<p>
	Our House leadership -- Speaker Newt Gingrich and Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas, in particular -- are very aware of the need politically to convince the American people of the critical importance of this issue. The focus right now is to make the American people aware that we have a big problem. As I said, Medicare is going bankrupt. We know that. Everybody here, I think, already knows of the Medicare trustees' report authored by HHS Secretary Shalala, Labor Secretary Reich, and Treasury Secretary Rubin. The trustees tell us that there is no question:  Medicare is going bankrupt in the year 2002. We need to make the American people aware of that massive shortfall and of its implications.
<p>

<b>THE CLIMATE OF OPINION</b>
<p>
	We are making progress. We just got some polling information on this topic, and it is interesting. Two months ago we did a poll, and nobody knew Medicare was a problem. But the polls that were just released yesterday by Linda DiVall say that there is a big change. Before, nobody would believe there was a problem with Medicare. Now when you ask them if there is a problem, 63 percent of the American people believe there is. In fact, 34 percent of the American people now realize there is a problem without the pollster even mentioning it to them. So we have made, I think, tremendous strides in raising the awareness of the American people. You cannot go to the solution until there is an awareness of the problem.
<p>
	We are also making progress in explaining what we are trying to do. We are not cutting Medicare spending. Whenever you hear Speaker Gingrich talking, that it's going bankrupt, he notes that we are going to spend more money on Medicare. What we are doing is reducing the growth of spending on Medicare.
<p>
	We are starting to get that message out, too. Two weeks ago, Tom Brokaw and NBC News came to my district, where we held a town hall meeting. When Brokaw introduced this segment on the national news, he said, "Republicans want to reduce the growth in spending."  The following week, ABC News did something on the same topic, and Peter Jennings introduced a segment about different Members of Congress and about how they are handling Medicare. Jennings introduced it by saying, "Republicans want to reduce the growth in spending on Medicare."  Sunday night, I was watching the NBC News and they even showed a segment with President Clinton, who said, during his talk with Speaker Gingrich, that Republicans want to reduce the growth of spending on Medicare.
<p>
	So we are making great progress. Now we are starting to say, "We're not cutting Medicare; we're slowing the growth of spending."  These are the numbers:  We are going from $4,800 a person to $6,400 a person (see Chart 1). That is not as much as future spending projections would be if we did nothing. Medicare is going bankrupt, but it is a very important program, and we must preserve it; we must save it; we must strengthen it. In doing so, we will still be spending $1,600 more per Medicare beneficiary.
<p>
	Our next task is to explain to everybody why Medicare is going bankrupt. Much of the problem is in the design. Medicare today is designed to increase spending on health care rather than control it. Members of Congress have always tried to ratchet down on the providers; go back and look at projected savings in past budget reconciliation bills. In drafting those bills, Members of Congress said, "We're going to save $50 billion," but they ended up saving very little. The desired savings never did materialize. 
<p>
	 Next year, in 1996, the amount of money going into the Medicare trust fund, which is Part A, is going to be less than the money that is going out, for the first time. The Medicare Part A trust fund is paid for, through payroll taxes, by employers and employees. Next year is the first time they will have had a negative figure for the year (see Chart 2). The Medicare trust fund right now has about $130 billion in surplus; in the year 2002, it crosses the line to zero. So it is very easy to see what happens to the fund. It is not just hypothetical; these are real numbers (see Chart 3).
<p>

<b>TAXES AND PREMIUMS</b>
<p>
	There are ways to strengthen Medicare, but what if we don't?  If we do nothing about reforming Medicare, the most likely choices are to raise taxes on working families or to increase premiums dramatically for seniors. There is no escape. You would have to raise the payroll tax over $1,700 for somebody who makes $40,000 a year or raise the Medicare premiums on senior citizens by 300 percent -- and neither of those options, in my view, can be sold to the American people. You cannot raise premiums on senior citizens by 300 percent, and you just cannot raise payroll taxes by 100 percent. We have to come up with a new solution.
<p>

<b>PRIVATE SECTOR EXPERIENCE</b>
<p>
	 Look at the experience of the private sector. Costs in Medicare are now going up 10.5 percent; the private sector's costs are going up 4.4 percent (see Chart 4). CEOs of large corporations have been telling us about the areas where health care costs are having a negative growth rate. At a House Budget Committee meeting, we had a presentation by IBM, Texas Instruments, and Eastman Kodak. They are all having a negative growth in their cost of health care, while we are having double digit increases in Medicare. So there is a lot to learn from the private sector. We can do a lot better in Medicare than we are doing today.
<P>
	Some, both in and out of Congress, are not only afraid of this issue, but also think that we can just put it off. They are wrong. We have to address the problem expeditiously. The reason:  Medicare's financial crisis is severe today and will only worsen tomorrow as the American population gets older (see Chart 5).

<p>
<b>TECHNICAL ISSUES</b>
<p>
	One of the technical issues that we have is scoring savings for private sector-style market efficiencies. Everybody here in Washington knows what budget scoring is. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates the cost of a policy; depending on how the policy is designed, it can be scored by CBO for savings. The question is, what is or is not a scorable saving?  President Clinton had the same problem two years ago with his health care reform bill. 
<p>
	 There are other cases -- for example, medical malpractice. We all agree that malpractice reform will save money, but the Congressional Budget Office says, "We don't know how much it would save, so you don't get any credit for passing malpractice reform."  The same issue arises with managed care:  HMOs do not necessarily save money. As we know, the Mathematica study came out and said you may even end up losing money on managed care. But should we simply let the CBO scoring drive our policy?  That is an issue we have discussed, and it makes it difficult.
<p>

<b>MEDICAL SAVINGS ACCOUNTS</b>
<p>
	I like the medical savings account option (MSA) in a reformed Medicare system. It is probably going to be one of the options available. The problem, critics say, with medical savings accounts is adverse selection; that is, the healthier people will want medical savings accounts and will desert conventional insurance. What this means is that in designing a medical savings account, we have to make sure that adverse selection is minimized.
<P>
	Remember that some critics say the very same thing about HMOs. The fear is that younger and healthier people will enroll in HMOs and desert traditional insurance, again causing a severe adverse selection problem. But, again, it depends on how you design the system. This problem is not overwhelming the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP), where we have a series of consumer choices. I can go to HMOs, PPOs, or fee-for-service. Our idea is to give people choices like that. I think that the MSA may also be one of our options; we are moving in that direction.
<p>

<b>KEEPING TRADITIONAL MEDICARE</b>
<p>
	Should we treat new enrollees differently than older enrollees?  I think, when you take 85-year-olds, it is much harder to change their health care behavior patterns than it is for 65-year-olds. We have said that we're going to maintain the traditional Medicare program. Some people are afraid of HMOs. New people entering the Medicare system should be treated differently than those over a certain age. Their life experiences are different. This is another practical item to be resolved.

<p>
<b>PRESCRIPTION DRUGS</b>
<p>
	Getting away from all the technical issues, I think it is very important to make it possible for elderly people to buy prescription drugs either by choosing an HMO or another managed care provider or through some other innovative option, including a new fee-for-service option.
<p>
	Again and again, we see that the most important single concern among senior citizens is the cost and availability of prescriptions. Their second concern, after prescriptions, is long-term care. When we talk about a general strategy in health care policy, we should be sensitive to this issue of long-term care and provide greater incentives for people buying long-term care. It is part of our larger health care reform strategy.
<p>
	
<b>SOLID INFORMATION</b>
<p>

	Finally, we should encourage states or private contractors, not the HMOs, to bring solid information to seniors. This addresses a lingering insecurity that seniors feel about making choices.
<p>
	One of our House Budget Committee proposals was to provide that kind of information. As a federal employee or retiree, you can go to a bookstore today and buy a book that explains all the different options we now have. That is perhaps still a little complicated. Federal workers and retirees like their system, but I think we can do it in a better, more simplified way. Under Medicare today, there are some choices, under Medigap, of supplemental insurance. If you want a Volkswagen or if you want a Rolls Royce, it's your choice. You pay for what you get. So choice is not utterly foreign to senior citizens. 
<p>
	 None of this is going to be easy. There are a whole series of challenges. Medicare is a very complex system. You have Medicare Part A and Medicare Part B and supplemental insurance, as well as a host of big private contractors and supervisory roles played by the Health Care Financing Administration, issuing thousands of pages of guidelines. It is a paperwork monster, but it was designed in 1965.
<p>
	It is time to get Medicare ready for the 21st century. It has to be addressed by the House Ways and Means Committee and the House Commerce Committee. It has to go to the House and Senate floors. We want it to be resolved by the time we pass the federal budget. We have made a commitment:  We will come up with a way to reduce the growth in spending to save Medicare and balance the federal budget. It is not only a promise; it is our duty.
<p>

<b>THE CHANGING POLITICAL DEBATE</b>

<p>
<a name="grace"></a><b>GRACE-MARIE ARNETT</b>:  It is a pleasure to be here with you at the Heritage Foundation's Physicians Council meeting.
<p>
	It was a pleasure to join you in hearing the presentation last night by Senator Bill Frist, a heart transplant surgeon and colleague of yours, who has demonstrated the power of one person's commitment to change. As all of you know, Dr. Frist decided to run for the United States Senate last year and won a huge upset victory in November. 
<p>
	 You also make tremendous contributions to your profession, both by your work, day in and day out, treating patients and by your added involvement in the policy process through the Physicians Council. By being part of this organization and by getting the word out about the central importance of the physician-patient relationship, you make a crucial contribution to health policy.
<p>
	I want to make a few preliminary comments as a transition into my remarks about the politics of health care reform. Dr. David Brown, Chairman of the Heritage Physicians Council, mentioned my work with the Consensus Group.1  We have done a great deal of work on market-oriented health care reform, advancing ideas that will help to restore the physician-patient relationship. But making any changes in the health care system is like turning a great battleship. It is so huge, it can only be done by degrees. If you try to spin a battleship too quickly you put the ship at great risk. You must instead set a clear course and begin to make those first few-degree turns carefully.
<p>
	The current employment-based system offers security to tens of millions of people. But it also has serious flaws -- leaving tens of millions of people without coverage and driving up the costs of health insurance and medical services. Yet it must not be changed too quickly, as we learned too well during the health care reform debate.
<p>
	Many of the changes advocated by earlier speakers, including <a href="/heritage/staff/moffit.htm">Bob Moffit</a> of The Heritage Foundation and Kevin Vigilante of Brown University, are important steps in moving the system in the right direction -- changes like giving individual Americans vouchers and tax credits for the purchase of health insurance. These changes would begin to give individual Americans more control over their health care spending choices as a transition to a more individually based health insurance system. Certainly, many employers will continue to offer health insurance as part of their employee compensation packages. If a person's employment-based plan offers the best option, they could choose that plan. But if their labor union, their professional association, or their school district offers them a better deal, they could choose that, instead. Personal choice is key.
<p>
	Now, I would like to talk about the politics not only of general health care reform, but also of Medicare. And I want to share with you what I believe is driving the debate. But before I do, my basic conviction, and my absolute, solid sense of the medical profession, is that you will prevail. The Bible's <i>Book of Sirach</i> (also known as <i>Ecclesiasticus</i>), Chapter 38, says:  "Hold the physician in honor, for he is essential to you, and God it was who established his profession."  I believe this Biblical passage shows that ultimately the independence and integrity of the medical profession will be preserved. 
<p>
	 The medical profession, as Dr. Brown said, cannot function without physicians. Nurses, physicians' assistants, and other medical professionals may gain more authority to do specific procedures. And that can be good in terms of economic efficiency. But medical care must be coordinated with the physician's supervision.
<p>
	These last few years have been traumatic for your profession. You have been "rolled" politically. But this can't last. The medical profession cannot move forward without physicians. But every single physician must ask himself or herself where he or she can make the most difference. And being part of this organization is a very, very good start.
<p>

<b>THE BATTLE OVER MEDICARE </b>
<p>
	Let us look at the terrain and the environment of this round of the battle over health care reform. If the rhetoric over Medicare spending were to be stripped away, it is clear that the health care issue is once again being used as a battleground for a major political clash over money and power. The debate over funding health care for the elderly is a debate over control of billions of tax dollars. It also represents a pivotal battle over the direction of federal programs. 
<p>
	 Medicare is in serious trouble. The Medicare trustees, including the Clinton Administration's Treasury and Health and Human Services secretaries, have warned that the program will go bankrupt in seven years unless major changes are made. Either taxes will have to be raised further or the program must be restructured. Raising taxes is the old way of doing business in Washington; updating the program to inject more market efficiency is the new way. It is a clear choice. 
<p>
	 Liberals have tried to entwine Medicare with the balanced budget agreement and tax cuts, but Medicare is a separate program with separate problems that must be addressed directly.
<p>
	In this latest incarnation of the health care reform debate, the voters are as alienated as they were last time, confused by the tactics and distortions. During the last phase of the health care debate over the Clinton bill in 1993 and 1994, the public was turned off by talk of health alliances, vast new bureaucracies, and fines, penalties, and jail terms to enforce the plan. None of this connected with them -- well, it connected with them; it scared them. But they didn't believe that the changes were going to help them in any meaningful way. And they were right.
<p>
	This time, the debates on health care have little to do with the health care system again, and everything to do with money and power. In 1993 and 1994, health care reform was to have been the vehicle for Congress and the executive branch to gain a lock on political power by providing health care that's always there for the middle class. The middle class didn't bite; in fact, they bit back.
<p>

<b>SOLID INFORMATION IS KEY </b>
<p>
	The American people had every reason to be afraid of the Clinton Administration's Health Security Act. I don't think anybody did more to give the American people the details of what was in that bill than The Heritage Foundation, particularly Bob Moffit. There were probably, at one point, maybe seven people in this city that had read the whole 1,342 pages, and Bob was one of them. 	
<p>
	 Bob Moffit did a line-by-line analysis, not only of what was in the bill, but what its implications were for the health care system. And he completed his analysis in just a few weeks. The background paper began circulating in policy circles, and people who were not going take the time to read the bill read Bob Moffit's analysis.2  It was a very important contribution to the debate.<p>	Soon after the bill was released, several of us who had read the bill, including Bob, gathered around a table and began exchanging revelations:  "My goodness, did you see what was on page 342?"  one said. "Oh, no, but did you see page 946?"  another answered. We were all aghast at the sweep and intrusiveness of this piece of legislation.
<P>
	The more the American people learned about the details of the bill, the more scared they got. And they learned about it because of that bedrock work by the health policy community.
<p>
	During the debate, the things that were most politically charged came percolating to the surface:  employer mandates, alliances, regulations, fines, penalties, jail terms. Then people started to say, "Wait a minute. This is un-American."  This change in popular opinion begins with the kind of detailed analysis that think tanks like The Heritage Foundation do.
<p>
	The American people got so frightened by what they saw that they said, "We don't want anything to do with that bill, and we don't want anything to do with anybody that cooked up that bill."  So they threw many of the liberals in Congress who supported the bill out of office. 
<p>
	 Fear is a very effective political motivator, and now fear is being used to unnecessarily scare seniors in the Medicare debate. To quote House Majority Leader Dick Armey of Texas, "The Democratic Party once stood firm on the conviction that Americans have nothing to fear but fear itself. Now the liberals stand firm on the conviction that they have nothing to offer but fear itself." 
<p>
	 There have been some very telling quotes in the health care reform debate. Consider the insights of Judith Feder, Deputy Assistant Secretary for Health Policy at the Department of Health and Human Services. In defending the Clinton plan, Judith Feder said, in a quote on the front page of <i>The New York Times</i> on December 5, 1993, "What we're trying to do is replace the ineffective, inefficient bureaucracy of the unfettered marketplace."
<p>
	At a conference in Chicago a couple of weeks ago, Ms. Feder said, "We're going to do to them what they did to us."  So flags are up. Liberals in Congress are now clearly trying to convince Americans that conservatives are gutting Medicare to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy. This is wrong.
<P>

<b>INTERESTS ARE SPECIAL </b>
<p>
	Many special interests are lining up to keep Medicare spending at its current unsustainable level. Medicare spending cannot continue to rise at 10 percent a year without bankrupting the program. The Medicare trustees themselves have acknowledged this. President Clinton has acknowledged this. But for every dollar the federal government spends, there are at least two constituencies:  the person who gets the services that are provided and the person who gets the money who provided those services. Every dollar that is saved by making the program more efficient is a dollar that will not be spent. There are a number of groups with a short-term view that want to keep spending federal tax dollars at the current rate, despite the consequences for the long-term solvency of the Medicare program and the future benefits of seniors and seniors-to-be.
<P>
	And they could win. Medicare is highly subject to political pressure. It illustrates the key reason why government involvement in the health sector is a bad thing:  Decisions are based upon politics, not economics, innovation, or efficiency. Short-term political expediency often prevails over long-term solvency.
<p>
	So now we have the special interests who, last time, lined up to fight government-run health care at all costs this time lining up to save government-run health care -- in the form of Medicare -- at all costs. Washington politics is nothing if not paradoxical. These special-interest groups are a grass-roots army, and they are arming to fight as Congress tries to restructure and save Medicare.
<p>
	Anybody who looks at Medicare's numbers knows that something has to change. Unless Congress is successful in getting to the root of the issue and rethinking the way the program is structured, Medicare's future will continue to be in jeopardy.

<p>
<b>POLITICS AND TAXES</b>
<p>
	Let's turn now, for a moment, to the debate over tax cuts. In 1980, Ronald Reagan swept into the White House and brought a Republican Senate with him on the promise to revive the American economy with across-the-board cuts in income-tax rates. And the largest peacetime expansion in this nation's history ensued. There are a lot of debates about why that happened. There is almost no debate that an extra dollar in the pocket of an American citizen is a better way for that money to be spent than an extra dollar spent by the federal government.
<p>
	President Reagan did what he said he was elected to do:  cut taxes. In 1990, President Bush said, "Read my lips:  No new taxes."  And then he broke his pledge. Pollsters who look for underlying trends say that President Bush's soaring popularity after the Gulf War was really only superficial; underneath, the popular anger at him for breaking his pledge over tax cuts never really went away, and he was defeated in 1992.
<p>
	In 1992, President Clinton ran on a promise:  middle-class tax cuts. Not only has he not delivered on a tax cut, but he won, by one vote, the largest tax increase in history in 1993. And he was proposing yet another tax increase through his health care bill. Look what happened in 1994:  The voters threw out dozens of legislators who supported these policies.
<p>
	Get the message?  If conservatives haven't learned the lesson that voters mean business when they talk about tax cuts, the liberals certainly have. They've learned that if they can stop conservatives from cutting taxes, they have a shot at regaining power.
<p>
	Liberals know they can't win the debate, an open debate, over raising taxes. They know they can't win an open debate over whether or not we should have a balanced budget. Medicare is the liberals' logical battleground, because it obscures what we're really talking about and there is a tremendous, electrifying charge of politics and seniors being frightened about losing their benefits.
<p>
	In 1996, liberals may not have a better idea about what they want to do if they're elected. But they certainly will try to use the politics of Medicare to stop conservatives from fulfilling their promises.
<p>
	Medicare is the battleground. It affects all of you on a very immediate basis, because it affects your ability to get fairly compensated for the services that you provide. That's not what this debate is about. In a more efficient market, you will get fairly compensated and likely will be unshackled from the huge burden of paperwork that Medicare demands. 
<p>
	 Nor is this debate about seniors getting less health care. The market could easily take care of giving seniors a benefit that's worth $4,800 today and $6,400 in seven years and give them the same, if not better, health care more efficiently. But Members of Congress may not have a chance to do that if conservatives get thrown out because the Medicare debate blows up in their face.
<p>
	I urge you to continue to participate in the debate, to continue to stay informed about the real issues that are being decided, and to help in the effort to put both the Medicare program and the whole federal budget on a more sound footing. 
<p>

<b>INFLUENCING THE POLICY PROCESS</b>
<p>

<a name="john"></a><b>JOHN C. LIU</b>:  I'd like to follow up on Senator Bill Frist's comments last night, supplementing what Grace-Marie just said on the politics of health care reform. Congress is the key actor, and we should be clear about what we expect in this Congress, short-term and long-term. As physicians and members of the Heritage Physicians Council, you can be instrumental in playing a key role in the policy debate.
<p>
	Bob Moffit and I attended town hall meetings across the country last year at which different Senators and Congressmen supported our position on where this health care reform should go:  consumer choice and competition.
<p>
	Congress unfortunately does not have the stomach to tackle comprehensive health care reform. This is partly because last year's debate was so grueling, the bills so detailed, and the legislative analysis so time-consuming that Members of Congress, with so much else on their agenda, fashioning budget and tax policy in particular, simply don't have the time in the remainder of this session to deal with the intricacies and complexities of comprehensive health care reform.
<p>
	But the problems remain. You still have a growing uninsured population in this country, mostly middle-class and lower-middle-class and low-income individuals working hard and struggling to put food on the table. At the same time, too many Americans have no practical access to health insurance, because current federal policy, through the tax code, has penalized them, making it significantly less affordable. If their employer, maybe a small business, cannot afford to give them health insurance, even a very scaled-down policy, they are in serious trouble.
<p>
	This same population that is uninsured is currently providing a subsidy to a growing population that is already getting health insurance. Through the tax code, through the HI payroll tax, they are subsidizing, and helping subsidize, the health care of our growing Medicare population, those 65 and over. And that tax burden is getting heavier. That is another reason why we must have Medicare reform this year. The Speaker of the House, the Senators on the Finance Committee, and others have wisely decided to tackle this issue of Medicare reform this year.
<p>
	It will be tough, but it must be done. As the Medicare trustees have stated, if nothing is done now, this system is not going to be around by the year 2002. That's only seven years away.
<p>
	Senator Frist told you last night to go back home and talk to your physician colleagues. As physicians, your views and opinions on health care issues are respected. Friends of mine who are doctors, and in their training and their residencies, are very impressed when they hear a sound idea from a colleague. When doctors hear a politician tell them something, a red flag goes up. But when a colleague offers an educated opinion or shares insights into what's going on, they tend to pay more attention. After all, you are the professionals providing health care to the American people.
<p>
	Visit your Congressman or state legislator back in the districts. It's perhaps more inconvenient to come to Washington, D.C., and meet your Senator or Congressman, but go back home. Call the scheduling office back in the district. Find out when your Congressman will be home in the district office, and be sure to schedule an appointment. Even fifteen minutes of their time, as Senator Frist mentioned, is valuable. You do not need to travel to Washington, D.C.
<p>
	Talk to your specialty organizations. As a colleague of mine last year said, unfortunately, organized medicine seemed "brain dead" when it came to health care reform. Even some of your specialty groups, unfortunately, have had only one obsession:  wanting to be a player at the table. That is not necessary. Groups in Washington, D.C., as you learned during last year's health care debate, do not always represent your philosophy. They often hire former staffers from the Hill who articulate official Washington's point of view. Because Congress has been dominated by liberals for the past forty years, far too many professional organizations have hired top liberal staffers from Capitol Hill to run their Washington offices, allegedly representing your interests back home. As you know, however, that is often not the case.
<p>
	There is no magic solution to influencing public policy. Write to professional organizations' newsletters and make your opinions known; write to your colleagues; go back and visit your alma mater if you can. Try the front door. Several of my friends have visited their med schools back in California and New York and have had maybe an hour's worth of time with their former dean. An even better idea:  You should spend perhaps an hour or so lecturing future med students on the direction of health care policy and its impact on medical practice. 
<p>
	 This Congress, in its first four months, already has achieved more in health care policy than the last Congress achieved in two years. A positive provision passed through the House under the Contract with America is that the self-employed now have access to a 25 percent tax deduction for their health insurance. And that has already been signed into law. Federal savings accounts are going to be introduced this afternoon. Congressman Bill Archer of Texas, the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, will be introducing an MSA bill.
<p>
	Congressman Bill Thomas of California, the Health Subcommittee chairman, has introduced an insurance bill which takes care of pre-existing conditions and allows individuals who change jobs, and who have been insured, to retain that coverage and not be penalized if they wish to switch insurers. Portability is still a major goal of health care reform, and work along this line is underway in the Senate.
<p>
	Again, this is in the first four months of the new Congress. Incremental changes are likely:  not as broad or sweeping as the government-run Clinton plan or as the free-market Heritage Foundation plan, but we will see advances in the right direction. Unfortunately, a lot of these measures are being advanced simply in the context of the present flawed system:  a tax policy which penalizes individuals for choosing their provider or their health plan outside of the employer's health plan.
<p>
	So there's a lot more to be done.
<p>
	Medicare, as Grace-Marie Arnett mentioned, will be the battleground for this Congress. I was at a conference not too long ago with Congressman Pete Stark, the former chairman of the Health Subcommittee of Ways and Means, a prominent liberal from my home state of California who proudly says that, as the chairman of the House Health Subcommittee, he was privileged to serve as "the CEO," along with eleven members, the "board of directors," of the Medicare program. This is a health insurance company, he said, that provides health care to 38 million Americans.
<p>
	That's a neat way of putting it. But apparently the shareholders didn't like their CEO and board of directors, voted them out, and installed a new CEO and board of directors for Medicare. This new board, I'm pleased to report, has embraced the idea that a free market is the best mechanism for controlling costs when it is allowed to work, and it should work for America's senior citizens.
<p>
	Congressman Dan Miller has been working on a draft proposal to present to the House of Representatives. He and several other members of the House Commerce Committee and the House Ways and Means Committee, which have jurisdiction over Medicare reform, will be working on this proposal.
<p>
	Medicare is in deep financial trouble. But Pete Stark and Congressman Sam Gibbons of Florida, responding to the Trustees' Report, a very nonpartisan report which comes out every year, say, in effect, "It's nothing to get hysterical about. We've been reading these predictions for the past several years, and they're always talking about insolvency. It's nothing to get hysterical about."
<p>
	And I would agree. Let's not get hysterical about it. But let's get concerned about it, because this 30-year-old system was designed to insure the health of those who were elderly and truly needy. While it would be bad form to get hysterical, it is high time to get serious.
<p>
	Medicare can't control costs, except through price controls and shifting costs to the private sector. We've seen the federal government slowly take tighter control of doctors and hospitals and implement more reams of rules and regulations. I don't need to go into the RBRVs, the DRGs, or the PPS. You know better than I do about the impact of these complex systems of fee schedules and price controls. They don't work.3  But unless something is done now, we should be very concerned, not just for our future, but for our parents' future, because this is a system that is designed to insure that we get quality health care in our golden years. And, as a nation, we are getting older.<p>	Liberal special-interest groups have been very vocal already, talking about Draconian cuts. And they know how to play the game. They've placed ads in the <i>Washington Post</i> and <i>New York Times</i> about what this Congress is going to do, or might do. We are being asked to write our Congressmen to make sure that Grandmother isn't going to get cut off from health care.
<p>
	While that is a good short-term scare tactic, the awful negative numbers in Medicare will force a public reckoning. Working Americans could be faced with huge taxes, including additional payroll taxes of 3.5 percent or even 3.9 percent.4  In my opinion, when the American people come to realize this, liberals in Congress will have lost credibility on this whole issue.
<p>
	Think back to the Medicare catastrophic debate in 1988. Liberals lost credibility. They lobbied to add benefit after benefit after benefit to what was, back then, a very lean Medicare catastrophic package. If it had passed as Bob Moffit's colleagues in the Reagan Administration had designed it, it would have been affordable. And it would have been workable.
<p>
	Unfortunately, special interests and liberals in Congress saw it as a great opportunity to lump on more benefits. And Congress back then was not well-known for saying "No."  So they added benefit after benefit, the cost soared, and the bill collapsed, to be repealed only a year later.5<P>	Nevertheless, as far as politics is concerned, Medicare reform is going to be tough. The media like to call any reform proposals Draconian cuts, for example. Heritage has put forward a major Medicare reform proposal that we just finished within the past twenty-four hours. We have drafted a defined contribution proposal that a lot of members on Capitol Hill have shown an interest in advancing.
<p>

<b>A MODEL FOR REFORM</b> 
<P>
	Basically, the Heritage Foundation proposal will allow seniors to apply a defined government contribution towards the health care plan of their choice, just as congressional and federal retirees do today in the popular Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). They can stay in current Medicare, if that's what they want to do. This is a good political measure. Obviously, no Member of Congress wants to go home and say, "I'm taking away your Medicare."  A lot of folks have grown accustomed to it, and anyway, we don't want to take it away.
<p>
	But for Americans about to retire, or those who perhaps are not happy with the current Medicare system, we are now offering choices. Heritage has prepared a paper detailing the specifics of this Medicare proposal.6  We hope that this concept will go far in defining the debate. From our conversations with the Speaker's office, the Majority Leader's office, and other members of the committees of jurisdiction, this basic concept of using the FEHBP as a model for Medicare reform is being very well received.
<p>
	Indeed, one of the Medicare proposals of the House Budget Committee, unveiled at a conference not too long ago in Virginia, was inspired by the Heritage Foundation model. Another one is a variation of this, offered by Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire. It's still a consumer choice proposal, but he has a stronger emphasis on managed care.
<p>
	Of special interest to physicians is that the American Medical Association has gone on record as supporting a Medicare voucher. Heritage has been working with the AMA, outlining common ground between their voucher proposal and our Medicare reform proposal.
<p>
	This is a national debate that we can win. This Congress has promised the American people it would hold back spending, cut back government, and give more choices and freedom to individuals. The average American is not stupid. He can make his own decisions. If active and retired Congressmen and Senators can choose their own health plan from among a variety of options, why can't their constituents?  If it's good enough for Ted Kennedy, if it's good enough for Al Gore, then it's good enough for the rest of us.

<P>

     Mr. Chairman, it has been recognized for years now by nearly
everyone -- from the right, left, and center of the political spectrum -- that
the U.S. foreign aid program is critically flawed. In addition to having too
many goals and too little focus, U.S. development assistance programs have
done little to advance economic growth in the developing world. Far more
important than economic aid in determining whether a developing country
emerges from poverty is that country's own economic policies -- in short,
how free its economy is. This fundamental fact has been overlooked by the
designers of America's foreign aid program. It is time to begin looking at
it. Without question, this Congress has a unique opportunity to reform
foreign aid. This opportunity must be seized. The American people will
support a foreign aid program, but only one that serves American interests
and promotes international economic growth.
<P>
     We at The Heritage Foundation have examined the issue of foreign
aid closely. We have published The Index of Economic Freedom, a study
that measures the comparative economic freedom of 101 countries. The
Index scores countries on ten factors, including taxation levels, trade
barriers, regulations, and openness to foreign investment. The purpose of
this study is to introduce a new understanding of economic development.
Hitherto, most development economists and the U.S. foreign aid bureaucracy
believed that a laundry list of factors ranging from health, education, and
even population controls must be manipulated by governments for economic
development to occur. The Index takes a different approach. It is based on
the premise that economic freedom is the most important factor in economic
development -- or, as we prefer to call it, economic growth. As we
discovered in the Index, how free an economy was, and not the amount of
economic assistance it had received, was the most important and consistent
determining factor in a country's level of economic development and its rate
of economic growth. This being the case, we concluded that the purpose of
economic aid should be to promote economic freedom and to create the
economic growth that will someday make this aid unnecessary. 
<P>
     But The Index of Economic Freedom is more than a study of the
factors contributing to economic development. It also can be instrumental
in evaluating America's development assistance programs. The Index can be
a useful tool with which to decide whether particular countries deserve
development assistance and, if so, what kind of aid is best for them.
  <P>   The assumption behind the Index and indeed our entire approach to
reforming foreign aid is that U.S. foreign assistance programs should serve
three fundamental purposes: 
<P>
 To enhance U.S. national security. 
<P>
 To advance American national interests.
<P>
To promote economic growth around the world, which creates markets for
American goods and contributes to democratization and international
stability.
 <P>
While we believe that U.S. foreign assistance should be used under certain
circumstances for humanitarian purposes and to help friendly foreign
countries in an emergency, we also believe that U.S. foreign aid programs
should be understood primarily as an extension of U.S. foreign policy and
designed to advance its goals. 
<P>
     Thus, some forms of assistance to advance the process of
democratization, if they are effective and given to deserving countries,
would be compatible with the U.S. goal of promoting international stability.
But economic development assistance, which by and large has failed, should
be carefully scrutinized and curtailed. To the extent that current military and
security assistance programs serve the national interest, they, too, should be
continued. Economic support for Israel, Egypt, Russia, and the Newly
Independent States (NIS) of the former Soviet Union by and large should
be retained, although in the cases of Russia and the NIS, some cuts can be
made safely. However, so-called economic support funds for Israel and
Egypt should not be understood as a means to promote economic
development, for they surely do not serve this goal, but rather as a form of
security support assistance and as a political demonstration of U.S. support
for the Middle East peace process.
<P>
     With these assumptions in mind, we have prepared a list of
recommendations for your committee to consider as it reviews the foreign
aid program. I need not remind the members of the committee that the
balanced budget amendment, if it passes the whole Congress, will bring
every federal spending program under close scrutiny. Foreign assistance
programs should be no exception. With that reality in mind, I have
combined the total savings from all the recommendations made in this
testimony into two budgetary options which I hope you will consider. 
  <P>   OPTION A ($2.58 billion savings). This option represents the
minimum amount which should be cut from this year's foreign aid budget.
It includes:
<P>
Reducing bilateral economic development assistance programs by 50 percent
for a total fiscal 1996 savings of $1.8 billion.
<P>
Trimming aid to Russia and the NIS by $200 million.
<P>
Shrinking funding for multilateral development banks by 25 percent for a
total savings of $481 million. 
<P>
 Abolishing the Agency for International Development for a savings of $100
million in administrative costs.
<P>
     OPTION B ($5.67 billion savings). The new budget environment
may require that you consider more drastic reductions than outlined in
Option A. If this turns out to be the case, you can look to our Option B
menu of cuts. This option includes:
<P>
Eliminating nearly all economic development assistance for a total fiscal
1996 savings of $3.6 billion.
<P>
Ending all aid to Russia and the NIS for a savings of $839 million.
Cutting 50 percent of U.S. funding for the World Bank, the International
Monetary Fund, and other multilateral development banks for a savings of
$963 million.
<P>
Cutting economic support funds for all countries except Israel and Egypt by
50 percent for a savings of $167 million.
<P>
Abolishing the Agency for International Development for a savings of $100
million in administrative costs.
<P>
GIVING AID A FREE-MARKET FOCUS: PROPOSALS FOR
REFORMING FOREIGN AID 
<P>     The U.S. foreign aid program must be fundamentally overhauled. In
this new political environment of fiscal restraint, foreign aid must not only
take its fair share of budget reductions, but also be reshaped to give its
remaining programs new life, new meaning, and a new mission. With these
goals in mind, we recommend that:
<P>
Economic Development aid be made contingent upon a recipient country's
commitment to free markets as determined by The Index of Economic
Freedom.
<P>
     There is a stark contrast between the tremendous economic progress
made by such countries as Hong Kong and Singapore that have pursued
free-market development strategies and other poorer countries like Tanzania
and Ethiopia that have pursued a statist approach to economic development.
Indeed, it should come as no surprise that two of the greatest development
success stories of the last few decades, Hong Kong and Singapore, share the
highest Index of Economic Freedom score of 1.25. These are two
outstanding examples of countries that have elected to unleash the
entrepreneurial energies of their peoples by pursuing free-market economic
policies. The results have been spectacular. The per capita GDPs of Hong
Kong and Singapore have grown nearly eightfold since the mid-1960s. Over
the same period the per capita GDPs of Ethiopia, Chad, and Angola grew
hardly at all, primarily because their economies were unfree.
<P>
     No one can argue seriously that economic assistance from the
advanced industrial democracies is the principal reason for the economic
growth rates of Hong Kong, Singapore, or even other "Asian Tigers" like
Taiwan or South Korea. To be sure, some of these countries (like South
Korea) have received massive amounts of military aid, but no reputable
economist would contend that spending money on tanks and guns is an
economic development strategy. No, the reason the economies of these
countries have grown is that they have chosen market economies. 
<P>
     Economic development aid not only does little to advance economic
development, but even can be detrimental to the welfare of the countries
receiving it. Tanzania is a case in point. Once a cause clbre of Western
donors, by the early 1970s Tanzania had become one of the most heavily
aided countries in the developing world. The U.S. Agency for International
Development (AID) was heavily involved in Tanzania, providing financial
support and technical assistance for forced rural collectivization, one of
Tanzania's many disastrous socialist schemes. Today, Tanzania is the
world's second poorest country, worse off than it was at the time of its
independence. Foreign aid unquestionably contributed to the destruction of
Tanzania's economy. It encouraged and enabled governments to pursue
harmful statist economic policies that made economic growth next to
impossible to achieve.
 <P>
     Another case in point is Chile, only the outcome has been markedly
different. Over the last several years, Chile has had one of the fastest
growing economies in the world. It is now the leading "Latin Jaguar." Yet
foreign aid had nothing to do with Chile's development success. Indeed, the
seeds of this success were laid only after the government of General
Augusto Pinochet was cut off from virtually all foreign aid following its
1973 coup d'etat.
<P>
     Here is how this success story happened. In 1970, Chile was the
world's second largest per capita recipient of foreign aid. It was also
stagnating economically. In 1973, Salvador Allende's last year as president,
Chile's GDP shrank by 5.6 percent. Around 75 percent of Chile's GDP at
this time was controlled by the government. However, after Pinochet came
to power, most of Chile's foreign aid was cut off. Unable to rely on the
crutch of foreign aid, Pinochet embarked on a privatization and market
reform program that transformed Chile's economy. By 1990 government
control of the economy had dropped to 25 percent. Moreover, Chile's infant
mortality rate was reduced from 78 to 17 per 1,000 births between 1970 and
1991, and its life expectancy rate rose from 64 to 72 years between 1970
and 1990. These improvements occurred because of economic growth, not
because of foreign aid programs.
<P>
     The Index of Economic Freedom is designed to help identify
instances in which development aid is playing the type of destructive role
that it once played in Chile. By helping to determine which countries are
economically free, the Index can help policymakers decide which countries
deserve economic aid -- i.e., those that are making progress toward a free
market -- and which countries do not deserve it -- i.e., those that are unfree
and are not making progress toward a free market. Governments with unfree
economic policies -- those possessing very high taxes, protectionist trade
policies, hostile foreign investment climates, and burdensome economic
regulations, for example -- will only waste economic aid. In fact, economic
aid too frequently is a crutch upon which the governments become
dependent and which prevents them from making the economic reforms
necessary to create economic growth.
<P>
     The Index of Economic Freedom has been recognized by many
concerned with the future of the U.S. foreign aid program as the best means
of identifying those countries with a commitment to free-market-generated
economic growth. George M. Ferris, Jr., Chairman of the 1992 President's
Commission on the Management of AID Programs, urged AID to establish
an Index of Economic Freedom for the purpose of allocating development
aid among countries. Last year, minority members of this committee,
including a few of you here today, encouraged AID to develop and use an
Index of Economic Freedom as a tool for its development aid allocation
decisions. Unfortunately, AID has resisted doing so, despite the fact that it
has the requisite data readily available.
 <P>
     Instead of putting the Index at the heart of America's development
assistance program, AID allocates aid according to a hodgepodge of criteria
that are not nearly as important as economic freedom. Take, for example,
AID's criterion of democracy and lawful governance. To be sure, democracy
is important to economic growth and stability in the long run, but
democracy alone is no guarantee of economic development. Singapore is no
democracy, yet its free economy generates very high rates of economic
growth. By the same token, Russia is slowly developing democratic
institutions, yet its economy is mostly unfree and stagnating. 
<P>
     Economic freedom is far more important to economic development
than democracy. In fact, in most cases, economic freedom is the best
foundation upon which to build democracy. In the long run free economies
produce growth and a middle class that come to demand civil rights,
political representation, and protection for their property. In short, as has
been seen in Taiwan, South Korea, Chile, and many other countries,
economic liberalization creates pressures for political liberalization. Some
countries like Singapore lag behind, but not all countries march in lock-step
toward democracy. While the pace of change may differ, most countries that
are economically free tend over time to become politically free as well. It
is probably only a matter of time before Singapore follows the path of
Chile.
<P>
     Fortunately, Singapore and other authoritarian regimes that pursue
free-market policies do not need or receive U.S. economic aid. Thus, the
moral question of whether we should be aiding an undemocratic free-market
country does not often arise. However, this question could arise if an
undemocratic government making progress toward economic reform were
to ask for aid. They could ask us for assistance to help them in their
transition toward a free-market economy even though they are undemocratic.
We may be facing such a question with respect to Russia sooner than we
think.
<P>
     Should we give economic aid to a government that is abusing the
human rights of its people? The short answer is "No, unless it serves some
higher national interest." This has been a long-standing tradition in U.S.
foreign aid policy. It was practiced widely during the Cold War and, if
national security considerations warrant, should continue in the post-Cold
War era as well. However, there should be fewer instances in which national
security considerations call for dispensing economic assistance. While we
can justify giving economic aid to less-than-savory governments for national
security reasons, our development assistance strategy should not include
aiding countries that are egregiously abusing their citizens. While a case
could be made that supporting economic freedom would lead to political
freedom in the long run, in extreme cases we cannot wait until that day
comes. Unlike private trade, government aid is too direct a symbol of
official and moral support. Discretion will have to be exercised if a recipient
government becomes abusive of its people.
<P>
     Another flawed AID criterion is "need" as determined by social
indicators. If this criterion is applied, all poor countries are more or less
deserving of economic aid. In fact, the poorest countries would be the most
deserving. But what if the recipient country's own economic policies are
mainly responsible for its poverty? If all we are doing is putting a Band-Aid
on misery that it is self-inflicted, how can we say that we are making a
substantial difference?  And if our aid is being used by corrupt governments
to perpetuate the very economic policies that are causing the poverty, how
can we continue in good conscience to dispense aid that amounts to little
more than a subsidy of economic misery? Looked at this way, we are not
satisfying the needs of poor people, but acting as accomplices to
governments that are keeping them poor.
<P>
     To be sure, one can find a U.S.-supported health or education
program abroad that has "done some good" for some people in the
developing world. Just as first aid relieves the pain and suffering of a sick
patient, economic aid can relieve in a limited way the pain and suffering of
people who are economically victimized by their own governments. But
economic first aid is not a development strategy. It is does not produce
economic growth. Free economies not only produce economic growth, but
also produce the wealth needed to improve health and education standards
for the greatest number of people. A free economy does far more to educate
people and raise health standards than U.S. economic assistance. In short,
it does more to meet the "needs" of the people. 
<P>
     Far from being too "narrow" a criterion for dispensing economic aid,
as AID Administrator Brian Atwood charges, the Index of Economic
Freedom encompasses the broadest possible number of factors that
determine economic development. The best way to address social "needs,"
clean up the environment, raise health standards, stabilize population growth,
and promote democratization is to produce economic growth. And the best
way to produce economic growth is to advance economic freedom. This is
a development strategy that is no less sophisticated for its simplicity of
purpose. In fact, it is far more sophisticated than the ahistorical analysis that
passes for economic development theory.
<P>
     Progress toward establishing free markets should be the sole
determinant in allocating development aid among countries. This is the
approach of Senator Mitch McConnell's foreign aid reform proposal
unveiled this past December. The McConnell proposal would condition
development aid on the adoption of free-market policies by recipient
governments as determined, in fact, by many of the factors of the Index of
Economic Freedom. Vice President Al Gore's 1993 "Reinventing
Government" report notes that "AID does not have a single, clearly defined
and articulated strategic mission." A free-market focus is what the U.S.
development aid program desperately needs.
<P>
Cut development aid spending.
 <P>    The conclusions of the Index of Economic Freedom suggest that U.S.
economic development assistance programs should be cut. Even if a case
could be made that all economic assistance were needed to promote
economic development around the world -- a case that cannot be made
seriously -- the new budget environment would argue in favor of reductions
in U.S. development assistance programs. I recommend to you the two
following budgetary options. Our analysis is based on the figures from last
year's foreign operations budget.
 <P>
     OPTION A ($1.8 billion savings). We assume that development aid
should be given under the right conditions -- i.e., directed at countries
moving toward free markets and used by them to assist them in the
transition. Under these conditions, development aid can make a difference,
although not a very large one. If used wisely, primarily to promote private
enterprise, it can encourage an environment in which a free market can
grow. With this assumption in mind, we have prepared a recommendation
that cuts most bilateral assistance programs by 50 percent. We anticipate
from these reductions a savings of $1.8 billion in fiscal 1996. In our range
of options, we consider Option A to be the absolute minimum which should
be reduced from this year's development assistance budget. Under no
circumstances should the Clinton Administration's development assistance
programs be fully funded.
<P>
     To assist you in deciding which countries' aid should be cut in
Option A, we have supplied you with a list of development aid recipients
scoring poorly on the Index of Economic Freedom. These are countries that
received either a "mostly unfree" or "repressed" score on the Index. Our
judgment is that you should scrutinize these countries very closely and
consider them prime candidates for reductions in -- or outright elimination
of -- economic development funds. They should be at the top of the list in
your efforts to meet the 50 percent reduction target.
 <P>
     OPTION B ($3.6 billion savings). The new budget environment may
require that you consider more drastic reductions in the development
assistance accounts. If this turns out to be the case, you can look to our
Option B menu of cuts in these accounts. In this option nearly all
development assistance aid is eliminated. Thus, all funding would be cut for
the African Development Foundation, the Development Assistance Fund, the
Development Fund for Africa, Eastern Europe and Baltic assistance,
population control, and other development programs. Savings from this
option would amount to $3.6 billion for fiscal 1996.
<P>
     As you move to reduce development aid spending, you certainly will
hear examples of development aid programs that "have made a difference"
in the lives of people throughout the developing world. Without question,
there have been "successful" development aid programs. Yet what is the
measure of success? Have these programs really made a difference to
national development, or have they been an oasis of achievement in an
otherwise barren environment? The best designed and executed agricultural
project will mean little in a country that is destroying itself through foolish
economic policies.
<P>
     Whether you choose Option A or Option B, you should be aware that
critics of cuts in development aid will try to portray you as lacking
compassion. They will use the same arguments that some people marshaled
to justify America's failed welfare system -- that "you don't care about
people" or that "some people" have been helped by the aid. You should not
be deterred by such arguments. Economic aid that does not encourage
economic growth or that serves no discernible strategic interest of the
United States is not only a waste; it is downright harmful to the people we
are pretending to help. Like our own welfare recipients, foreign governments
develop a kind of corrupting dependence on U.S. government funding.
Although the programs are different, the results are the same: We encourage
behavior that is self-destructive.
<P>
     Major cuts in development assistance do not amount to neo-
isolationism. Neither Option A or Option B touches military or security
assistance programs. Nor do they affect aid to Egypt and Israel. They affect
only aid that purports to spur economic development. Since it turns out that
most of this aid has been a failure, eliminating it would have no discernible
impact on international stability or international economic development.
America's overseas commitments would be reaffirmed not only by the
continuation of military and security aid, but by the far more important
military alliance and security commitments that the United States has made
to friends and allies overseas.
<P>
     In the end, it must be realized that the only reliable development
strategy is one that recognizes the true power of the market and the private
sector. In his excellent report, Development and the National Interest (1989),
former AID Administrator Alan Woods estimated that the American private
sector invested $12 billion a year in overseas development efforts. However,
the best "aid" any country can give another is free trade. The some $4
billion of bilateral development aid the U.S. provides to the developing
world is a drop in the bucket compared to the trillions of dollars that change
hands every year in private trade. No wonder that one of the most desired
prizes from the U.S. these days is not economic aid, but a free-trade
agreement. Most developing countries have come to realize that their future
rests not with AID or the World Bank, but with NAFTA and other free-
trade agreements.
<P>
Trim and rename Economic Support Funds.
  <P>  The rationale for Economic Support Funds (ESF) differs from that
for development aid. ESF is given to advance U.S. political and security
interests. While ESF, like development aid, does little or nothing to advance
economic development -- in fact, an argument can be made that it actually
retards economic growth -- we recommend continuing ESF for Egypt and
Israel. However, we believe that ESF funds should be renamed to reflect
their purpose more accurately. Since they are intended primarily to support
our security interests, we believe they should be renamed "Security
Supporting Assistance," which is what they were called before the name was
changed to Economic Support Funds in 1978. Israel and Egypt are by far
the biggest recipients of U.S. foreign aid. This year, Israel and Egypt will
receive $1.2 billion and $815 million, respectively, in Economic Support
Funds (ESF). These two countries command the bulk of ESF funding.
<P>
     OPTION A (no savings). No cuts in ESF are recommended in Option
A.
<P>
     OPTION B ($167 million savings). In this option we recommend a
50 percent reduction of economic support funds for all countries except
Israel and Egypt. In 1995, $334 million of ESF was appropriated for such
countries as Cyprus, Turkey, Morocco, Cambodia, and Ecuador. A 50
percent cut would damage our relations with these countries, but it would
not irreparably harm our fundamental national security interests. Such a
reduction would realize a savings of $167 million.
<P>
Revamp and cut aid to Russia and the Newly Independent States (NIS).
<P>     It is axiomatic that the U.S. has a vital stake in Russia's future.
Russia faces momentous challenges. Whether or not foreign aid can improve
Russia's chances of succeeding in developing free-market and democratic
systems is uncertain. I am inclined at this time to give the benefit of the
doubt to continuing a foreign aid program for Russia. I am sufficiently
convinced that, on balance, Western engagement in terms of foreign aid
helps keep the reforming spirit -- however it may flicker -- alive. But this
is a close call. Moreover, the point at which aid to Russia should be ended,
including a drastic reversal on reform, could come overnight. 
<P>
     What is crystal clear is that the case for continued Russian aid has
been weakened by the poor performance of AID. Without taking local
conditions into account, AID applied its Third World experience to Russia,
allocating the bulk of contracts to its "traditional" contractors, as opposed
to organizations and professionals with appropriate regional, industry, and
language experience. These multi-million-dollar nongovernmental
organizations -- including CARE, Save the Children, the Academy for
Educational Development, Experiment in International Living/World Vision,
and the Urban Institute -- had little or no experience in the former Soviet
Union. Unfortunately, their organizational culture, shaped by years of
working in the developing world, has hindered their work in the region.
Meanwhile, Russian nongovernmental organizations, even the most pro-
reform ones, are often excluded from the AID bidding process.
<P>
     Indeed, the AID contracting process is arcane and often understood
only by those with long-term relationships with the Agency. This effectively
screens out worthwhile organizations which lack an inside track. Tom Dine,
AID's Assistant Coordinator for the NIS, has publicly stated that if he could
have one wish fulfilled, it would be the abolition of AID's contracting
office, which has been primarily responsible for perpetuating the cozy
relationship with traditional contractors. 
<P>
     OPTION A ($200 million savings). Two recommendations are made
in Option A. The Congress should:
<P>
Reduce aid to Russia and the NIS from $839 million to $639 million. The
pace of aid delivered to this region so far has been slow, in part because
these countries are incapable of digesting the aid that already has been
appropriated. This region should not escape budget cuts. A good place to
look is the Officer Resettlement Program (ORP) which helps to build
housing for Russian army officers returning from abroad. The idea was to
prevent a restive and angry Russian army from challenging Yeltsin's
democratic regime. However, the Russian military has been mainly
responsible for the debacle in Chechnya. It stands to reason that if aid
should be cut, they should be at the top of the list. Thus, a $100 million
rescission should be imposed on funds already appropriated but not spent on
the Officer Resettlement Program, and another $100 million should be cut
from fiscal 1996's budget, not only for next year's appropriation for the
ORP, but also for other aid programs, such as the Eurasian Foundation,
which have not performed as well as expected.
<P>
Reprogram $75 million from health and environmental programs to other
programs. Health and environmental programs have a relatively low impact
on the development of a free market in Russia. There are difficulties in
identifying worthy projects in Russia and NIS. As a result, these funds are
disbursed at an even slower rate than in other areas. At the same time,
democratic reform, rule of law, and other crucial tasks are underfunded.
Thus, the money could be used better in building democratic institutions in
Russia. This proposal results in no net change in the overall Russian and
NIS assistance budget. 
<P>
 OPTION B ($839 million savings). The best circumstance for choosing this
option would be a determination by you that Russia no longer deserves our
aid or that the aid is not effectively assisting the transition to democracy and
a free market. Indeed, while in our estimation Russia still deserves aid for
now, it is not difficult to imagine circumstances in the near future when it
would not. The war in Chechnya has raised serious doubts about President
Yeltsin's commitment to democracy and reform. It is not even clear that he
is in charge of the country. Moreover, Russian foreign policy has become
less friendly in the past year. Yeltsin is opposing the expansion of NATO
and interfering in his neighbors' affairs.
<P>
     If, based on these facts, you were to decide that aid to Russia should
be eliminated entirely, you would realize a savings of $839 million for fiscal
1996. However, at this time we do not recommend this option. I fear that
cutting off all aid at this point would only drive Russia further into isolation
from the world community. Moreover, our democratic friends inside Russia
tell us that aid is still an important symbol of our commitment to them.
However, I cannot predict where I will stand on the issue of Russian aid
next year. If current trends inside Russia continue, I fear that I would be
hard pressed to recommend a continuation of aid next year.
<P>

Reduce funding to all multilateral development banks (MDBs).
  <P>   The fiscal 1995 House Republican budget would have ended U.S.
support for the International Development Association (IDA), the
concessional loan window of the World Bank. This proposal would have
realized savings in the billions over a five-year period. The Republican
budget alternative also proposed that the U.S. withhold all new capital
contributions to the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development,
Asian Development Bank, International Finance Corporation, European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development, Inter-American Development Bank,
and African Development Fund. This proposal also would have realized
savings in the billions over five years. Whether the U.S. chooses to zero-out
some of these activities or make across-the-board funding cuts, it should
begin stepping away from the MDBs.
<P>
     The MDBs duplicate many private sector activities, particularly
lending. Many of the MDB loans could be secured from private financial
institutions. Indeed, over the last decade, there has been a flood of
investment to the developing world. The fact that many World Bank loans
could easily be privatized makes the point that its lending activities are
redundant.
<P>
     It is argued that there are troubled countries that would not be able
to attract capital without the MDBs. To the extent that this is true, it can be
attributed largely to the economic policies of such countries -- policies for
which the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and other MDBs
bear considerable responsibility. Consider the words of Czech Prime
Minister Vaclav Klaus, who has complained about the statist orientation of
the IMF and World Bank. Klaus has noted that IMF and World Bank aid "is
wrong and counterproductive." This aid, Klaus maintains, "is not taken
seriously, neither by the donors nor recipients. They are misused,
misdirected. They simply disappear. They are very often counterproductive.
They prolong the moment when the necessary domestic changes have to be
implemented." Klaus's insight can explain the deterioration of the World
Bank's project performance, as documented even in the Bank's own 1992
"Wapenhans Report." It also highlights the importance of aiding only those
countries moving rapidly toward the establishment of a free-market
economy, as is the Czech Republic. This imperative has been unappreciated
by the MDBs, and the U.S., frankly, has little chance of changing this.
<P>
     Another problem for the World Bank is the corruption of its
conditionality. The World Bank's structural adjustment programs, which are
foreign aid packages designed to liberalize the economies of developing
countries, have not been effective. It has been estimated that some half of
all economic reform programs endorsed by the IMF and the World Bank
break down. Yet the donors almost always soon return. In other instances,
development aid recipients pretend to comply with economic adjustment
program conditions while donors simply pretend to believe them. This
hypocrisy and lack of responsibility is a fallow field in which to plant the
seeds of economic growth.
<P>
     This game of pretend is not necessary. Even the World Bank
concedes this to be true when it notes in its 1993 World Development
Report that "Some of the most dramatic 'adjustment' reforms took place
without adjustment lending (as in Chile and Vietnam), and some countries
that received adjustment loans did little or nothing to pursue reforms (for
example, Tanzania and Zambia)." The key to developing vibrant free-market
economic growth is not to be found in the MDBs.
<P>
     This committee's report of last year quoted a 1982 Reagan
Administration review of the multilateral development banks and their
contribution to American security: "To the extent that the MDBs encourage
the participation of developing countries in that international system on a
permanent and self-sustaining basis, they are one of the major vehicles
available for pursuing these U.S. economic and political/strategic interests."
In the succeeding 13 years, I have not seen the MDBs achieve these goals
to much of an extent. Rather than make a ritualistic annual appropriation to
these institutions, I encourage the committee to make 1995, the fiftieth
anniversary of the creation of the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank, a time of fundamental reassessment. This would be done best
with a funding cut.
<P>
     OPTION A ($481 million savings). In this option funding for all
MDBs would be reduced by 25 percent. This would result in a savings of
$481 million for fiscal 1996. Reducing the MDBs in this way would send
a signal to the world community that unless the MDBs undertake major
reform, the United States will begin to step away from them and the
approach to multilateral development assistance which they represent.
OPTION B ($963 million savings). In this option funding for all MDBs
would be reduced by 50 percent. This would result in a savings of $963
million for fiscal 1996. This option would be chosen to demonstrate that the
U.S. has chosen to disengage from multilateral development assistance
altogether.
<P>
Eliminate the Agency for International Development.
  <P>   AID has failed at its mission of promoting economic development
overseas. Since its creation in 1961, AID has spent over $144 billion in
development aid. Yet most of the countries that have received U.S.
development aid remain mired in poverty, repression, and dependence. Of
course, a large part of this failure can be attributed to the fact that
development aid has been used to prop up socialist economies; hence, the
urgency of utilizing the Index of Economic Freedom.
<P>
     Before taking charge of AID two years ago, incoming Administrator
Brian Atwood labeled the agency a "disaster." Soon after this, Atwood
volunteered AID as a "reinvention lab" for Vice President Al Gore's task
force to reinvent the federal government. Of course, AID had undergone
four major management reorganizations and had been the subject of fourteen
management studies within the previous eight years.
<P>
     While Vice President Gore's September 1993 Creating a Government
That Works Better and Costs Less: Agency for International Development
found that "Reinvention is not simply an option or a challenge for AID; it
is an imperative," this report rejected "reasonable arguments" for AID's
absorption into the State Department or for its abolition. The President's
Commission on the Management of AID Programs (1992) and numerous
other studies had recommended absorption into State; the Hamilton-Gilman
Task Force Report (1989) had recommended abolition. The Vice President's
report instead concluded that, with reform and strong leadership, AID "could
reclaim its potential to be an effective provider of U.S. development
assistance."
<P>
     I would assume that AID has been implementing the reforms
recommended in the Vice President's report. Yet press reports over the last
few weeks suggest that AID came within a few threads of extinction at the
hands of the "Super State Department" proposal rejected two weeks ago.
What is troubling is what this says about AID's reform progress. It appears
either that the Vice President's report was not the right prescription for
shaping AID into an effective provider of development assistance or that
AID has been rejecting its medicine. Neither answer is encouraging, and the
situation begs the question of where AID goes from here. It should go away.
We have heard too many promises of reform, from both Republican and
Democratic Administrations, to give AID any more chances.
 <P>
     Defenders of AID make the point that another chance is due because
AID has been laboring under hopelessly burdensome and conflicting foreign
aid legislation. Indeed, the Vice President's report concluded that "AID does
not have a single, clearly defined and articulated strategic mission." The
report notes that AID's reinvention can succeed only if the Foreign
Assistance Act of 1961 (as amended) is replaced with comprehensive new
authorizing legislation.
<P>
     Yet AID struck out with its legislative reform effort. The Clinton's
Administration's Peace, Prosperity, and Democracy Act of 1994 was a
bureaucratic catch-all which did nothing to give AID a strong focus, never
mind a free-market development vision. Not surprisingly, it went nowhere
in the last Congress. So AID continues to operate without the reform
foundation everyone, including AID, realizes is desperately needed. Stated
bluntly, how can this committee in good faith continue to fund such an
operation?
<P>
     A trimmed down development aid program aimed at fostering free
markets around the world could be run out of the State Department, utilizing
its worldwide presence and achieving economies of scale. Any ESF could
be administered by such offices as the Under Secretary of State for Arms
Control and International Security Affairs and the State Department's
Bureau of Political and Military Affairs. 
<P>
 OPTION A AND B ($100 million savings). It has been estimated that if
AID were eliminated and its remaining functions folded into the State
Department, $100 million could be saved in overhead and administrative
costs.
<P>
CONCLUSION
  <P>   There should be no doubt that the foreign aid budget will be cut this
year. The only question is by how much. With that reality in mind, I have
combined the total savings from all the recommendations made in this
testimony into two budgetary options which I hope you will consider. They
are:
<P>     OPTION A ($2.58 billion savings). This option represents the
minimum amount which should be cut from this year's foreign aid budget.
Thus, we recommend reducing most bilateral development assistance
programs by 50 percent (for a total of $1.8 billion in savings for fiscal
1996) while trimming aid to Russia and the NIS by $200 million. The
bilateral development assistance reduction should be made in the following
programs: African Development Foundation; Development Assistance Fund;
Development Fund for Africa; Eastern Europe and Baltic programs; the
Inter-American Foundation; International Organizations; population control,
migration, and refugee programs. Moreover, we envision in this option
shrinking funding for multilateral development banks by 25 percent for a
total savings of $481 million. Finally, we propose a savings of $100 million
in administrative costs from abolishing AID.
  <P>  To assist you in deciding which countries should be cut in Option A,
we have supplied you with a list of aid recipients scoring poorly on the
Index of Economic Freedom. These are countries that received either a
"mostly unfree" or "repressed" score on the Index. Our judgment is that you
should scrutinize these countries very closely and consider them prime
candidates for reduction or outright elimination of funds. They should be at
the top of the list in your efforts to meet the 50 percent reduction target. 
<P>
     OPTION B ($5.67 billion savings). The new budget environment
may require that you consider more drastic reductions than outlined in
Option A. If this turns out to be the case, you can look to our Option B
menu of cuts. In this option nearly all development assistance aid is
eliminated ($3.6 billion in savings), including that for Russia and the NIS
($839 million in savings). The bilateral assistance programs affected would
be the African Development Foundation, the Development Assistance Fund,
the Development Fund for Africa, Eastern European and Baltic assistance,
population control, and other development programs. Also in this option is
a 50 percent drop in funding for the World Bank, the International Monetary
Fund, and other multilateral development banks for a total savings of $963
million. Moreover, this option includes a 50 percent reduction of economic
support funds for all countries except for Egypt and Israel ($167 million in
savings). Finally, $100 million would be saved by abolishing AID. Total
savings from this option would amount to $5.4 billion for fiscal 1996. 
<P>
     Whether you choose Option A or Option B, one thing is certain: the
budget for foreign aid should be reduced. At a time when America's
national security could be endangered because of shortfalls in defense
spending, it makes no sense to spend $2 billion to $3 billion a year on
development programs that do not produce economic growth and do not
serve the national interest. This money would be invested far more wisely
in reversing the decline of defense readiness or in funding the estimated
$100 billion shortfall in the Clinton Administration's five-year defense plan.
Why, because of falling pay, should America's servicemen and women have
to live on food stamps while AID funds population control programs in the
Third World? We need to reorder our priorities. We need a foreign aid
program that serves the national interest and promotes economic freedom
and economic growth.

<TITLE>Abolish The Wasteful Agency For International Development  -- Heritage </TITLE>

Executive Memorandum #402<br>
January 27, 1995<P>

<P>
 
It is time to abolish the U.S. Agency for International Development (AID), the 
executive branch agency that administers most American foreign aid 
programs. AID has failed in its mission to promote economic development 
overseas. Despite billions of dollars spent on economic assistance, most of the
countries receiving U.S. development aid remained mired in poverty, 
repression, and dependence. In addition, AID lacks focus and, 
notwithstanding repeated attempts at reform, is poorly managed. Only a 
complete overhaul of America's foreign aid programs will make those 
programs more efficient and effective. 
<P>
To its credit, the Clinton Administration realizes that there is a serious 
problem with AID. Vice President Al Gore's September 1993 report, Creating 
a Government That Works Better and Costs Less, concludes that "AID does 
not have a single, clearly defined and articulated strategic mission." This 
conclusion has been reached by scores of commissions and independent 
studies. After two years and several reform attempts by Administrator J. Brian 
Atwood, including his Peace, Prosperity and Democracy Act of 1994, which 
failed to pass Congress, AID continues to be notable for its fuzzy mission, 
poor management, waste, and fraud. 
<P>
AID's failures cannot be papered over by folding it into the State Department, 
as some in the Clinton Administration were advocating this week. Abolishing 
AID by moving its functions to another bureaucracy offers little chance of 
significant reform in the way the U.S. designs, distributes, and spends nearly 
$14 billion in foreign aid dollars each year. U.S. policymakers should abolish 
the agency altogether, along with most of its functions. 
<P>
The best way to determine which AID functions should be saved and which 
should be abolished is to examine critically the purposes and effectiveness of 
U.S. foreign aid programs rather than the programmatic effectiveness or even 
managerial efficiency of any given bureau. These programs should be cut or 
eliminated based on their own merits. If, after this analysis, a program is 
retained, it should be administered by an existing office within an existing 
agency. Under no circumstances should a new bureaucracy be created inside 
the State Department or any other agency to accommodate programs spun off 
from an abolished AID. 
<P>
Once AID is eliminated, some foreign aid programs will still exist. Military 
and security assistance programs, for example, are administered primarily by 
the Department of Defense and should be retained for national security 
reasons. So, too, should military and security aid to Israel and Egypt. 
Although economic support funds for these two countries do nothing to 
promote economic development -- in fact, they may actually harm their 
economies -- an argument can be made that they should be continued in order 
to demonstrate political support for the Middle East peace process. If 
Congress deems Israeli and Egyptian aid necessary for national security 
reasons, lawmakers should rename it "Security Supporting Assistance," which 
is what it was called before 1978 when it was renamed Economic Support 
Funds (ESF). Once AID is abolished, these programs could be administered 
by such offices as the Under Secretary for Arms Control and International 
Security Affairs and the Bureau of Political and Military Affairs. 
<P>
There are, however, two broad areas of foreign assistance that should be cut 
back drastically or eliminated entirely, as should the AID bureaucracies which 
have administered them. These programs are: 
<P>
Economic Development Assistance. According to AID, Development 
Assistance funds are intended to promote economic growth in less developed 
countries. AID spent nearly $2.1 billion on development assistance projects in 
FY 1994. Since 1946, the U.S. has given nearly $265 billion in development 
assistance to foreign countries. Yet there is scant evidence that this aid has 
propelled many countries into the developed world. The late AID 
Administrator Alan Woods was right when he argued in his 1989 study, 
Development in the National Interest, that "Where development has worked, 
and is working, the key has been economic growth. And this is largely the 
result of individual nations making the right policy choices and making the 
most of their internal human and material resources." 
<P>
The keys to economic development are free markets and free trade. Whether 
aid promotes or fails to promote them should be the fundamental criterion for 
economic assistance. The Index of Economic Freedom published by The 
Heritage Foundation provides such a criterion. The Index uses ten economic 
factors to grade the level of economic freedom in a given country. Countries 
with high levels of freedom have established the necessary economic system 
for achieving sustainable levels of economic growth. Countries with low 
levels of economic freedom still have systems in which government impedes 
economic growth. Sending development assistance to these countries would 
be a waste. The U.S. should adopt the Index as a tool to determine which 
countries are most likely to benefit from foreign aid and which ones are most 
likely to waste it. 
<P>
Once this is done, much U.S. economic assistance would be cut. It would be 
impossible to justify maintaining all of the nearly $4 billion a year in U.S. 
economic aid if the criteria in the Index were applied. As much as $2 billion a
year could be trimmed from AID's budget alone. As these funds were 
eliminated, so, too, could the supporting AID and related overseas offices be 
abolished. This would lead to a substantial reduction in bureaucracy which 
need not be moved to the State Department or any other governmental 
agency. 
<P>
P.L. 480 Food Aid. Given the major agricultural reform bill coming before 
Congress this session, as well as requirements that the U.S. reduce agricultura
subsidies as part of recent free trade agreements, Congress should eliminate 
one of America's largest agricultural subsidy programs: the so-called P.L. 480 
programs aimed at providing food to impoverished countries. All too often, 
by depressing prices, this aid ruins the local food market of the very people i
is intended to help. While some of its functions may be maintained under an 
"emergency food relief program" administered by the State Department or 
other departments, most of the $1 billion spent annually on emergency aid 
and agricultural development could be eliminated. So, too, should the AID 
supporting bureaucracy. 
<P>
AID has failed in its mission to promote economic growth in less developed 
countries. There is little correlation between foreign aid spending and 
economic growth. Rather, the evidence shows that those countries which have 
graduated from the depths of poverty and into the developed world did so by 
creating the economic freedom that is necessary for expanding economies. 
<P>
When he introduced AID in the early 1960s, President John Kennedy said it 
should be seen as a temporary transitional agency. AID never was intended to 
make the developing world dependent on international welfare. It is time for 
Congress to abolish AID and transfer whatever useful functions remain to the 
State Department.

Backgrounder Update #240<br>

Foundation Backgrounder No. 1005, October 6, 1994)

February 22, 1995

<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>

The February 7 arrest of Ramzi Yousef, suspected mastermind of the
February 1993 World Trade Center bombing, has underscored the global
reach of terrorist networks and the need for stepped-up international
cooperation in combating terrorism. Yousef, who fled the United States only
hours after the most devastating terrorist attack ever perpetrated on
American soil, had been extremely active prior to his arrest. The mysterious
27-year-old was implicated in a terrorist bombing of an airliner in the
Philippines in December, a plot to assassinate Pope John Paul II in January,
and an aborted attempt to bomb an American airliner in Thailand earlier this
month. 
<P>
     Yousef's ability to escape arrest and cross international borders
undetected repeatedly for two years indicates that he had extensive help in
many different countries. His considerable financial resources, large supply
of false documents, and access to safe houses, explosives, local assistance,
and information about his planned targets in far-flung regions of the world
suggest that he enjoyed the backing of a well-organized network, and
possibly a state sponsor. Significantly, the U.S. government now is
reexamining the possibility that a terrorist state was behind the World Trade
Center bombing.
<P>
     President Bill Clinton has hailed Yousef's arrest as an important
victory in the war against terrorism. But the President deserves little credit.
In fact, Yousef's arrest occurred in spite of the efforts of the Clinton
Administration. For example, Yousef's arrest in Pakistan was made possible
by an informant motivated by a $2 million reward offered by the U.S.
government for information leading to Yousef's capture. Yet the
Administration initially refused to offer a reward in the case of the World
Trade Center bombing, arguing that it was an act of domestic terrorism and
therefore not eligible for the International Terrorist Information Reward
program. The Administration eventually relented under considerable
congressional pressure and offered the reward in July 1993, almost five
months after the bombing.
<P>
     Yousef's apprehension and rapid extradition from Pakistan can be
attributed to close coordination among the State Department, Justice
Department, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Central Intelligence
Agency. This coordination and the close cooperation between the U.S. and
Pakistan were mainly a function of the State Department's Office of
Counterterrorism. However, the Clinton Administration had planned to
downgrade this office and fold it into a new Bureau for Narcotics,
Terrorism, and Crime. In addition, the Coordinator for Counterterrorism was
to be reduced in rank from the current equivalent status of an Assistant
Secretary of State to the level of a Deputy Assistant Secretary. Congress
temporarily blocked this reorganization scheme in April 1994 by passing an
amendment to the State Department authorization bill sponsored by
Representative Benjamin Gilman (R-NY). 
<P>
     Trying to reassert leadership on terrorism issues, the Administration
introduced legislation on February 10 to bolster U.S. deterrence of terrorism
and to punish those who aid and abet terrorists. The Omnibus
Counterterrorism Act of 1995 will outlaw fundraising in the United States
in support of terrorist activities overseas, expedite the deportation of alien
terrorists, and make international terrorism committed in the U.S. a federal
crime. This legislation is a long-overdue step in the right direction. But it
focuses primarily on domestic and legal aspects of the war against terrorism.
Ramzi Yousef's arrest is an important reminder that international efforts are
a key ingredient in fighting terrorism.
<P>
     The critical challenge facing U.S. counterterrorism policy is putting
relentless pressure on the states that sponsor terrorism -- Cuba, Iraq, Libya,
North Korea, Syria, Sudan, and particularly Iran, the chief supporter of
international terrorism in the world today. This is an opportune time to
ratchet up the pressure because Iran and other state sponsors of terrorism are
economically weak and diplomatically isolated. But the Administration has
not followed through on its tough rhetoric on terrorism. It has not given up
on plans to downgrade the State Department's Office of Counterterrorism,
for example, and continues to woo Syria despite Syria's continued support
of more than a dozen terrorist groups.
<P>
     Congress has an opportunity to strengthen U.S. counterterrorism
policy above and beyond the legislative proposals the Administration is
pushing. To do so, Congress should:
<P>
Press the Administration to make counterterrorism a higher priority in
American foreign policy. Congress should force the Administration to drop
its short-sighted plan to downgrade the State Department's Office of
Counterterrorism, which spearheads international efforts in combating
terrorism. The Gilman amendment, which bars the Administration from
downgrading the office, expires on April 30, 1995. Representative Gilman
has introduced H.R. 22, a bill to preserve the office on a permanent basis
and elevate the Coordinator of Counterterrorism to the status of an
Ambassador at Large, as was the case in the Reagan Administration. Senator
Alfonse D'Amato (R-NY) introduced a similar bill in the Senate. Congress
also should press the Administration to raise the issue of terrorism in every
appropriate bilateral and multilateral diplomatic contact, including the annual
G-7 summits. A series of congressional hearings on new trends in
international terrorism would help to highlight the threat of terrorism and the
urgency of fighting it. Another vital topic for congressional hearings is
investigating strategies for blocking the efforts of terrorist states such as
Iran, Iraq, and Libya to obtain weapons of mass destruction. A nuclear-
armed Iran or Iraq could pose the ultimate terrorist threat.
<P>
Reform immigration laws to improve internal security. Congress should pass
legislation that enables the U.S. government to deny visas to foreigners
because of their membership in terrorist groups. Right now, would-be
terrorists are denied entry only if the government can prove that they
already have committed terrorist acts or that they intend to commit such
acts. These rules are too lax and should be strengthened. Moreover, tougher
penalties should be imposed on the production or use of fraudulent passports
and visas, including giving the government the power to seize the assets of
criminals convicted of creating or using false documents for terrorism or
drug smuggling. Nine of the original 35 indictable counts in the 1993 New
York bombing plots involved visa or passport offenses.
<P>
Punish states that support terrorism on as many fronts as possible. The U.S.
must work with its allies to raise the diplomatic, economic, political, and
military costs of supporting terrorism so high that they outweigh the
strategic benefits. Although the Administration has singled out Iran as the
world's most dangerous state sponsor of terrorism, it has not succeeded in
persuading its allies, particularly Japan and Germany, to levy economic
sanctions against Tehran. In part, this is because American oil companies
have become Iran's biggest customers, buying about $4.2 billion dollars of
Iranian oil annually to supply their overseas markets. Although imports of
Iranian oil into the U.S. are prohibited, the Clinton Administration has
declined to ban U.S. companies from purchasing Iranian oil for their
overseas markets. This business-as-usual approach undermines American
diplomatic efforts to isolate Iran and to raise the cost of its continued
support of terrorism. Congress should consider passing legislation banning
American oil companies from purchasing Iranian oil and should call upon
U.S. allies to do the same as long as Iran supports Hezbollah, Hamas, and
other terrorist organizations.
 <P>
 Ensure that impending budget cuts do not undermine the war against
terrorism. Congressional appropriations committees must take care to avoid
weakening the organizations crucial to America's defenses against terrorism
-- particularly the counterterrorism efforts of the intelligence community, the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, the State Department's Office of
Counterterrorism, and the Defense Department's Special Operations
Command. The Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Asset Control,
which is responsible for implementing the U.S. government's freeze on the
financial assets of terrorist groups, also should receive a high priority in
budget deliberations. It also is important to reverse the decline in the budget
of the Counterterrorism Research and Development program, which helps
develop new means of detecting explosives, among other things. Cutting
such programs not only would jeopardize the nation's security, but would
be penny-wise and pound-foolish. The World Trade Center bombing, which
resulted in six deaths and over 1,000 casualties, triggered over $600 million
in economic losses. 
<P>
 Assist the governments of Lebanon and Afghanistan to restore order and
expel international terrorists. Civil wars exacerbated by foreign interventions
have enabled terrorist groups to operate with impunity from bases in both
of these countries. Ramzi Yousef and several other terrorists involved in the
World Trade Center bombing had extensive contacts with radical Afghan
Islamic groups. Congress should hold hearings to determine ways in which
the U.S. can assist the weak central governments in both countries to
dismantle and expel terrorist groups.
<P>
     The war against terrorism requires concerted international efforts
which only the U.S. can lead. But the Clinton Administration does not
appear willing or able to exercise the leadership necessary to mobilize the
international community decisively against terrorism. This makes it all the
more important that Congress take steps to combat international terrorism,
which looms as one of the greatest challenges to U.S. security in the 1990s.

<html><title>Clinton Blows Smoke Over Foreign Aid Cuts -- Heritage </title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><H3><I>CLINTON BLOWS SMOKE OVER FOREIGN AID CUTS</H3></I>
By Thomas P. Sheehy<br>
Jay Kingham Fellow in International Regulatory Affairs<br>
Executive Memorandum No. 416<br>
June 7, 1995<br>
</center><hr size =3 width = 30%>
<P>
	The U.S. Agency for International Development (AID) and its allies are pulling out all the stops in their fight against congressional foreign aid cuts and the reorganization of the foreign policy bureaucracy. AID Administrator Brian Atwood and other Clinton Administration officials have resorted to tagging as "isolationists" those critical of the status quo, including supporters of the American Overseas Interests Act (H.R. 1561). Yet the U.S. foreign aid program, particularly development aid, is riddled with wasteful projects that benefit only the AID bureaucracy and outside contractors. Administration officials have never explained how failed development aid programs demonstrate foreign policy credibility.
<P>
	Cutting Time. Congress is sure to reject the Administration's request for increased foreign aid spending for 1996. Instead, it will reduce foreign aid from its 1995 level of $13.7 billion. President Clinton, vowing to reject such cuts, threatens to veto H.R. 1561, which trims $2.8 billion from the Administration's proposed $21.6 billion overall foreign affairs budget. H.R. 1561 reduces development aid by some $800 million and abolishes AID, moving its functions into the State Department. 
<p>
	The Administration's response is an orchestrated campaign to "tar" those seeking to cut and revamp foreign aid as isolationists. National Security Adviser Anthony Lake calls supporters of the House bill "back door isolationists," his epithet for critics of the Administration's foreign aid policies. Atwood, whose AID faces long-overdue extinction, says that would-be foreign aid cutters are "playing with fire."
<p>
	Notwithstanding Atwood's alarmist rhetoric, AID has been known for years for its inefficiency and wasteful spending. Indeed, previous administrations, repeatedly but unsuccessfully, have tried to reform AID. Atwood himself once recognized the problem. Upon taking office, he described AID as a "disaster" and quickly volunteered it for "reinvention" under Vice President Al Gore's National Performance Review. Administrator Atwood has made much of his reforms in trying to fend off legislative efforts to abolish AID.
<p>
	Reform efforts have been hamstrung, however. The Vice President's review recognized that AID's reinvention could not succeed if new foreign aid authorization legislation was not secured. The Administration's foreign aid "reinvention legislation" failed in the last Congress. AID's legislative agenda today is different. In the Agency's own words, its bureaucrats seek to "delay, postpone, obfuscate, derail" congressional reform efforts.
<p>
	Delaying reform will result only in a continuation of AID's notorious waste and inefficiency. AID employs over 9,200 full-time employees and contractors at a cost of more than $600 million annually and has 998 foreign service officers stationed overseas at a cost of between $150,000 and $300,000 per employee -- not including salary. By contrast, the German and British development agencies have 27 and 47 overseas staff, respectively. Former Secretary of State James Baker was right when he said that "AID's only useful purpose is to serve as a standard for inefficiency for other agencies to avoid."  But the agency's heaviest burden is defending its work. 
<P>
	AID Pork. There is no evidence that foreign aid is instrumental in promoting economic growth. More often, it is destructive. Sometimes it is simply wasted. Consider the following: 
<P>
<ul><li>A U.S. group called Development Associates, Inc., performed an AID contract to study the Agency's own evaluation studies -- i.e., a study to study AID's studies.
<P>
<li>A U.S. company called Planning & Development Collaborative International contracted with AID to sponsor a 1993 study tour in the U.S. for the Romanian Union of Architects. AID never explained how acquainting Romanians with American architecture helps Romania develop a free-market economy. 
<P>
<li>Four organizations collaborated to perform an AID contract worth over $2 million which culminated in a study of "ecotourism" in Central America that includes a section on "the cultural and socioeconomic impacts of tourism" and a list that ranks "the desirability of native fauna for the tourist industry by marketing value and observation satisfaction."  American tourists are better equipped than AID-contracted experts to determine their level of "observation satisfaction" when touring Central America.
<P>
<li>The Academy for Educational Development of Washington, D.C., in 1993 undertook a study for AID of how Indonesian health workers can improve their interpersonal communication skills. One recommendation of this study: to conduct further study. 
<P>
<LI>Chemonics International of Washington, D.C., has a multiyear contract with AID worth nearly $2 million to spearhead a project "that promotes [throughout the world] public awareness and support for environmental policies and practices by changing individual behavior, institutional activities, and governmental approaches."  AID never explains why it is worth $2 million to the American taxpayer to conduct an environmentalist public relations campaign in the Third World.
<P>
<li>AID is planning to award a $1.3 million contract to supply street lamps to the city of Moscow at the same time the Russian government is spending more than $1 billion to make war on the people of Chechnya.
<P></ul>
	AID has spent hundreds of billions of dollars on junkets for university professors, studies that gather dust, and other efforts that are irrelevant to promoting economic growth. At best, development aid can make a marginal contribution to encouraging the free-market transitions responsible for economic growth. The programs listed above do not pass even this low standard of success.
<P>
	Spreading the Pork. Aware of its weak hand, AID has been playing the pork game. In fighting for survival, it has made a virtue of the fact that it spends the taxpayers' dollars at home. Atwood recently noted, "Now, fully 79 percent of the USAID procurement budget, spent to purchase goods and services essential to USAID development work, is spent here in the U.S."  AID has been rallying its American beneficiaries to lobby against foreign aid cuts.
<P>
	Many of AID's American contractors are only marginally "private," being heavily dependent upon AID for support. In essence, they are quasi-government agencies. Some are havens for former AID employees adept at pulling the procurement strings. And like AID, many contractors suffer from large overhead. For example, the U.S. Ambassador to Chad noted in an April report to the Secretary of State that U.S. development aid to that African country "was spent mainly on overhead, expensive contractors and consultants, and had little impact except to develop the culture of dependency which is part of the problem."  Congress should resist the temptation to look at development aid as serving a domestic constituency.
<P>
	The real isolationists are not those looking to eliminate wasteful foreign aid projects. The real neglect of America's international interests comes from those who engineer reckless defense cuts and trade wars with allies like Japan. These are the great issues of the day upon which isolationist reputations will be made -- not whether Washington spends a couple of billion dollars less on wasteful development aid and abolishes a hopelessly inefficient AID bureaucracy. When it comes to foreign aid, it is the Clinton Administration that not only is "playing with fire" but blowing smoke.

Welcome to Town Hall's INFOTAINMENT.  I'm your host, Ann Klucsarits.  Each week I'll be bringing you some informative yet entertaining (get it? info-tainment) game or activity that will highlight the lighter side of conservatism.  Sometimes you'll be amused, other times challenged, but I  promise you that you'll always be entertained.<p>

This week's special is a <a href="/townhall/infotain/th_tour/door.html">tour of our very own Town Hall.</a>  Meet the faces behind the e-mail addresses and learn just a little bit about how we all work together to bring you the best sources of ideas and information in the conservative movement.<p>

In the weeks ahead, you can come to INFOTAINMENT to participate in polls, contests, and other games, and get a bird's eye view of Town Hall's kick-off event with House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole.<p>

We'd love to have your feedback and suggestions, so send any one of us an e-mail while you're on the tour!<p>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center>
<h2>Town Hall Launch</h2>
June 29, 1995
</center>
<p>
<hr size="3" width="45%">
<p>
<b>Tim Butler</b>: About four years ago <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Ed Feulner</a> had an idea.  Now there is nothing new there, but he understood that a new emerging on-line technology was going to have a tremendous impact on the way America and the world communicates.  He also understood that the conservative movement must embrace
 these new communications opportunities.  The result of that is Town Hall.  Today Town Hall moves into a new dimension, the Internet.  And I'm very pleased to introduce the man behind the dream, Dr. Edwin J. Feulner, Jr., Town Hall's Chairman of the Board.
<p>
<b>Ed Feulner</b>: Thanks very much Tim, for that very nice introduction.  I appreciate it.  I'm very pleased to have with me my colleague from the Town Hall Board of Directors, Ed Capanno whose real job is publisher of <a href="/nationalreview/welcome.html"><i>National Review</i></a>.  Town Hall, from its very beginning, has been a joint project of <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a> and <i>National Review</i>.  And Ed, it's been a great learning curb for us, certainly, and we've been through a lot, but I think today bears witness to the fact that it has been worth working at.
<p>
 We are here today to officially launch Town Hall, the first conservative community on the Internet.  Like most communities, Town Hall has been created to serve people.  To provide an innovative site for political discourse and dialogue -- an international electronic center where new ideas and policies can be debated and studied by anyone who's interested.
<p>
 And Town Hall will use the technology of the Information Age -- the Internet -- to create this community of literally millions of people around the world.
<p>
Two hundred years ago, people concerned about the direction of their government and committed to the ideals of freedom and liberty, joined together to talk and argue, to dream and debate radical new ideas to make their lives and the lives of their families, their children, and their communities better.  In that respect, Town Hall will be no different.
<p>
I am very proud that the Heritage Foundation and National Review, together, created Town Hall as the conservative meeting place on the Internet, and I am equally proud that, through Town Hall, will continue to play a part in the Second Great American Revolution that has swept Washington and the halls of Congress like a great whirlwind.  Today, we have with us, the Revolution's two great generals in this extraordinary battle of ideas.
<p>
 From the Senate, we have Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, who continues to fight for America's families after a lifetime of commitment to his country.  In war and in peace, Bob Dole is and always will be a national leader -- a man of action and a man of accomplishment.
<p>
On the House front, everything <a href="http://www.house.gov/mbr_dir/GA06.html">Newt Gingrich</a> does shows how deeply he cares about his country and the hopes and dreams of its people.  He is a man of endless ideas whose extraordinary leadership has literally changed the course of history.
<p>
 We stand here in the shadow of the Capitol -- at one end of a long continuum -- a continuum that began
 with the goosefeather pen of Thomas Paine and reaches across time to the computers that sit here on this stage.  I can't think of anyone better to launch this historic connection than these two men -- leading the charge to preserve the Founding Fathers' great legacy of freedom.  Please join me in welcoming Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole and Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich.
<p>
Gentlemen, thank you both for joining us.  We're honored to have you here.  Before I ask you to take a seat at the controls, I want to bring out another special guest we are privileged to have with us today.  Just to make sure that the Founding Fathers would have approved, we've been able to produce someone who ought to know.  Please welcome in his 290th year, the father of invention and innovation, the Honorable Benjamin Franklin.
<p>
Senator Dole, Mr. Speaker will you each take a seat at the keyboards and Mr. Franklin, will you do the honors, please?
<p>
<b>Benjamin Franklin</b>: Let it be known that on this, the 29th day of June in the year of our Lord one thousand
  nine hundred and ninety-five, we open wide the doors of Town Hall in a spirit of experiment and good
  will; to preserve liberty and prevent tyranny, and to seek change in the principles, opinions, sentiments and affections of the people as we share in the progress of human knowledge.  Gentlemen, on the count of  three.... one ... two ... three ... start your engines.
<p>
<b>Ed Feulner</b>: Alright!  Town Hall is officially launched!
<p>
Thank you very much, Senator Dole, Mr. Speaker and, of course, you too Mr. Franklin.  Thomas Jefferson would be proud.  It is now my happy duty to introduce you to the charter members of Town Hall -- America's leading conservative organizations who vision and creativity have spurred them to join in this innovative effort.  I'm very please to welcome them to the Town Hall Community.
<p>
As I introduce their representatives, we will all get a look at each group's site as it will appear in Town Hall on big screen.
<p>
<ul>
<li>First, please welcome, <a href="/conservative/kbio.html">David Keene</a>, Chairman of the <a href="/conservative/welcome.html">American Conservative Union</a>.
<li>Next, Shades of the Boston Tea Party, is Grover Norquist, President of <a href="/atr/1.html">Americans for Tax Reform</a>.
<li>It is a great pleasure to welcome Charlie Kupperman Executive Director of <a href="/empower/welcome.html ">Empower America</a>.
<li><a href="/townhall/FRC/bauer.html">Gary Bauer</a>, President of the <a href="/townhall/FRC/welcome.html">Family Research Council</a>.  Welcome aboard, Gary.
<li>Representing <a href="/lead-inst/home.html">The Leadership Institute</a>, William Forrest, its Vice President.
<li>The Executive Director of the <a href="/taxcom/welcome.html.cgi">National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform</a>, Grace-Marie Arnett, unfortunately is unable to attend.
<li>We are delighted to also have with us, <a href="/nmp/home.html">National Minority Politics</a> and its distinguished publisher,<a href="/nmp/i-col.html"> Willie Richardson</a>.
<li>John O'Sullivan, Editor of <a href="/nationalreview/welcome.html"><i>National Review</I></a> Magazine.
<li><a href="/pff/people/staff.html">Bethany Noble</a>, Vice President of the <a href="/pff/">Progress and Freedom Foundation</a>.
<li>The president of the <a href="/sbsc/home.html">Small Business Survival Committee</a>, Karen Kerrigan.
<li>We're indeed pleased to announce that the <a href="/wash_times/">Washington Times National Weekly Edition</a> will be on Town Hall and represented is its Editor-in-Chief, Wes Pruden.
<li><a href="/yaf/home.html">The Young America's Foundation's</a>, <a href="/yaf/sharp.html">Michelle Sharp</a>, Director of Lectures, is here.
<li>And Finally, my colleague -- <a href="/heritage/staff/truluck.htm">Phil Truluck</a>, the Executive Vice President of <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a>.
</ul>
<p>
As Tim said, it's a great starting line-up, but only the beginning of a conservative community.  We thank  you all for being here today.  I would now like to give you all an opportunity to hear from our two  wonderful leaders here today.  It is truly an honor for me to first introduce to you the great Speaker of the House of Representatives -- the Honorable Newt Gingrich.

<b>Senator Dole</b>: Thank you very much.  It's a privilege for me to be here, and a privilege to see Ben Franklin again.  He was just telling me about his childhood with Senator Thurmond.  But Ben Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, and the rest of our founding fathers probably never imagined the
 technology that produced the computer age, and the Internet.  But one thing they did imagine -- a
 government closer to the people; a government that listened to the people, and a public that took active
 involvement in the issues today, and that is what Town Hall is all about.  Thanks to Town Hall, Americans are into the information age and the super-highway to take a detour around the traditional media road blocks.  And I am just one of countless Americans, who will be taking a right on the information highway, and heading straight for Town Hall.<p><hr>

<img alt="Picture of Speaker Gingrich" src="gingrich.jpg"><p>


<b>Speaker Gingrich</b></a>: I want to say first of all that I am delighted to be here.  I was explaining to Senator Dole that last night we pretended we were the Senate.  And we ran all night, and we're not use to this, we didn't get out till almost ten o'clock this morning.  He's used to these kind of marathons where you have to go all the time, but we're not quite that tough.  I'm a little blurry eyed, but delighted to be here.  I believe this is part of entering the information age, I think that this is a very important commitment to reach out and to allow literally people around the entire planet to be able to interact, have ideas, to have dialogues, to know
what's going on.  And to contribute good ideas.  And I'm just delighted that Ed Feulner brought all of us
together here today, to participate in creating Town Hall, and I can tell you from our stand point we look
forward to having lots of Americans, and frankly lots of people all across the world, to share with us their
ideas and their comments, and then to work with the various groups who will have their pages on this site.  We're very grateful, and I'm delighted to behalf of the House Republicans to be here to help inaugurate this.<p><br>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<img alt="The Classic Kirk " src="kirkclas.gif" align="right">For more than forty years, Russell Kirk was in the thick of the intellectual controversies of our time. Both 
<i>Time</i> and <i>Newsweek</i> have described him as one of America's leading thinkers. He is the author of some 
twenty-nine books and of hundreds of periodical essays; also of many short stories.
<p>
Dr. Kirk wrote and spoke on modern culture, political thought and practice, educational theory, literary 
criticism, ethical questions, and social themes. He addressed audiences on nearly five hundred American 
campuses and also appeared often on television and radio.
<p>
He was editor of the educational quarterly journal <i>The University Bookman</i> and was founder and first 
editor of the quarterly <i>Modern Age.</i> He contributed to numerous serious periodicals on either side of the 
Atlantic. For a quarter of a century he wrote a page on education for <i>National Review,</i> and for thirteen 
years published, through the Los Angeles Times Syndicate, a nationally-syndicated newspaper column. 
Over the years he contributed to more than a hundred serious periodicals in the United States, Britain, 
Canada, Australia, Austria, Germany, Italy, Spain, Bulgaria, and Poland, among them <i>Sewanee Review, 
Yale Review, Fortune, Humanitas, The Contemporary Review, The Journal of the History of Ideas, World 
Review, Crisis, History Today, Policy Review, Commonweal, Kenyon Review, The Review of Politics, </i>
and <i>The World and I.</i>
<p>
Dr. Kirk was president of the Wilbur Foundation; president of The Educational Reviewer, Inc.; 
editor of <i>The Library of Conservative Thought</i> for Transaction Books; and from time to time distinguished 
visiting professor at various universities and liberal-arts colleges in the disciplines of history, political 
thought, humane letters, and journalism.
<p>
He is the only American to hold the highest arts degree (earned) of the senior Scottish university - doctor of 
letters of St. Andrews. He received his bachelor's degree from Michigan State University and his master's 
degree from Duke University. Honorary doctorates were conferred upon him by twelve American 
universities and colleges.
<p>
<img alt="Gothic Kirk" src="kirkgoth.gif" align="left">He was a Guggenheim Fellow, a senior fellow of the American Council of Learned Societies, a 
Constitutional Fellow of the National Endowment for the Humanities, and a Fulbright Lecturer in Scotland. 
The Christopher Award was conferred upon him for his book <i>Eliot and His Age, </i>and he received the Ann 
Radcliffe Award of the Count Dracula Society for his Gothic Fiction; the Third World Fantasy Convention 
gave him its award for the best short fiction. In 1984 he received the Weaver Award of the Ingersoll Prizes 
for his scholarly writing. For several years he has been a Distinguished Scholar of the Heritage Foundation. 
In 1989, President Reagan conferred on him the Presidential Citizens Medal. In 1991, he was awarded the 
Salvatori Prize for historical writing.
<p>
More than a million copies of his books have been sold, and several have been translated into German, 
Spanish, Dutch, Korean, and other languages. His second book, <i>The Conservative Mind </i>(1953), was one of 
the most widely reviewed and discussed studies of political ideas in this century and has gone through 
seven editions. Seventeen of his books are in print at present, and he has written prefaces to many other 
books, contributed essays to them, or edited them.
<p>


Dr. Kirk debated with such well-known speakers as Norman Thomas, Frank Mankiewicz, Carey 
McWilliams, John Roche, Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., Michael Harrington, Max Lerner, Michael Novak, 
Sidney Lens, William Kunstler, Hubert Humphrey, F. A. Hayek, Karl Hess, Clifford Case, Ayn Rand, 
Eugene McCarthy, Leonard Weinglass, Louis Lomax, Harold Taylor, Clark Kerr, Saul Alinsky, Staughton 
Lynd, Malcolm X, Dick Gregory, and Tom Hayden. Several of his public lectures have been broadcast 
nationally on C-Span.
<p>
<img alt="Kirk and Buckley" src="kirkbuck.gif" align="right">Among Kirk's literary and scholarly friends have been T. S. Eliot, Roy Campbell, Wyndham Lewis, 
Donald Davidson, George Scott Moncrieff, Richard Weaver, Max Picard, Ray Bradbury, Bernard Iddings 
Bell, Paul Roche, James McAuley, Thomas Howard, Wilhelm Roepke, Robert Speaight, Anthony 
Kerrigan, Robert Nisbet, Malcolm Muggeridge, Flannery O'Connor, William F. Buckley, Jr., Andrew 
Lytle, Henry Regnery, Robert Graves, and Cleanth Brooks.
<p>
<img alt="Young Kirk" src="kirkyng.gif" align="right">Born near the railroad yards at Plymouth, Michigan, in 1918, Kirk lived at his ancestral place, named Piety 
Hill, in Mecosta, Michigan - a little village in the stump-country. There he converted a toy factory into his 
library and office. His Italianate house is adorned with sculpture and architectural antiques snatched from 
the maws of the urban renewers of western Michigan. At home he was a famous narrator of ghostly tales, 
many of them picked up during his travels (often afoot) in Scotland and Ireland, Mediterranean and Alpine 
lands, and Africa.<p>

<img alt="Kirk and Annette" src="kirkfam.gif" align = "left">
For nearly thirty years he was married to Annette Yvonne Cecile Courtemanche; they have four daughters. 
Their tall house often was crowded with Asiatic, African, and European refugees and exiles; also with 
university students, travellers from antique lands, and a congeries of fugitives from Progress. In 
conjunction with the Intercollegiate Studies Institute and the Wilbur Foundation, Russell and Annette Kirk 
held frequent seminars at their residence and received several literary interns every year. Annette Kirk was 
an active member of the National Commission on Excellence in Education; she organizes the Piety Hill 
Seminars, and is managing editor of <i>The University Bookman.</i>

 
<p>
Additional information about him may be found in <i>Contemporary Authors, Who's Who in the World, 
Who's Who in America, Who's Who in the Midwest, International Scholars Directory, The Directory of 
American Scholars,</i> and other biographical directories. Chapters about his writings and his life may be 
found in Henry Regnery's <i>Memoirs of a Dissident Publisher,</i> John East's <i>The American Conservative 
Movement,</i> and M. E. Bradford's <i>A Better Guide Than Reason.</i>
<p>
The definitive work on Russell Kirk's life can be found in his own autobiography, <i>The Sword of 
Imagination,</i> available now through Eerdsmans Publishing.
<p>
<i>Russell Kirk: a Bibliography,</i> 1981; illustrations. Compiled by Charles Brown, with an essay by Henry 
Regnery. Mount Pleasant, Michigan: Clarke Historical Library, Central Michigan University. Distributed 
by Intercollegiate Studies Institute. $5.00 hardcover.

<P>
Our friend Russell Kirk, &quot;The Wizard of Mecosta,&quot; seemed
an ill-suited visitor to Washington back in 1978. He was accompanied
by his loving wife Annette, and he shared with a packed auditorium
some of the truths that made his published works so powerful and
so influential.
<P>
Then sixty years old, Russell Kirk was not a newcomer to Washington,
and yet he was certainly not a part of this unreal, political
place.
<P>
Despite his visits here in subsequent years, Russell Kirk was
always more comfortable surrounded by his family and his books
in Mecosta. He was at home among inquisitive students on one of
the college campuses where he held visiting appointments or where
he lectured.
<P>
Despite his discomfort, however, he made a real impact on Washington.
In a city of constant change, Kirk reminded opinion leaders, journalists,
legislators and staffers of prudence and of taking the long view.
<P>
It was at an I.S.I.-sponsored seminar, more than thirty years
ago over the Christmas holidays, that I first met Dr. Kirk. He
was already a fixed star in the conservative firmament. Although
he has described himself in those days as &quot;roly-poly and
benign,&quot; all of us students were in awe of him.
<P>
Had we known that he was an occasional eater of beaver and an
habitual smoker of &quot;dark, thick,&quot; Burmese cigars, &quot;looking
and tasting . . . Like torpedoes,&quot; we probably would have
addressed him with even greater trepidation. Yet, as he talked
with a small group of us on that frosty night in Detroit I could
not project that twenty years later Russell Kirk would be a Heritage
Distinguished Fellow and that three of his books would be based
on lectures that he first delivered here.
<P>
Over the years, Russell's Washington lecture themes would include
natural law, the prospects for conservatives, and individual rights.
They are masterpieces of clear thought and eternal truth.
<P>
These volumes and his other works mean that Russell Kirk's influence
in Washington will continue to be far greater than many
of the transient politicians who descend upon this city, cycle
after cycle.
<P>
As a back row observer at his soirees for the last sixteen years,
I never ceased to be amazed by the inevitable overflow crowd of
young people who couldn't get enough of him.
<P>
I asked one of them what his hold was on them. Her reply: &quot;I
had only admired him from afar and, of course, reading his books
at my university was not politically correct.&quot; Or, as a young
Reagan appointee said, &quot;He taught us all why our role was
important beyond ourselves and beyond politics.&quot;
<P>
Russell Kirk's operating guide was prudence and what Patrick Henry
called &quot;the lamp of experience,&quot; which abhorred all
forms of ideology claiming some instant substitute for genuine
tradition, custom, and experience.
<P>
He often described himself as a &quot;Bohemian Tory.&quot; A Bohemian
Tory who adapted to his environment, whether this meant a humble
cellar, a rustic cabin, a city mansion, or one of the great country
houses of Europe.
<P>
From time to time here in Washington, Russell was entertained,
feted, or downright idolized. While he seemed to enjoy this, his
heart belonged to Mecosta.
<P>
Russell Kirk has left an indelible mark on us, on Washington,
and on our nation. Perhaps his words have more meaning for us
today because, as one of his friends, T.S. Eliot puts it:
<P>
&quot;The communication of the dead is tongued with fire beyond
the language of the living.&quot;

<A href="#index">Index</A> <CENTER><B>Gleaves Whitney<BR>
on behalf of <BR>
The Honorable John Engler, Governor of Michigan</CENTER></b>
<p>
 Russell
Kirk once wrote: &quot;Men are put into this world . . . to struggle,
to suffer, to contend against the evil that is in their neighbors
and in themselves, and to aspire toward the triumph of Love. They
are put into this world to live like men and to die like men.&quot;
<P>
By his own measure, Russell Kirk lived a robust and manly life,
and he died a noble and manly death.
<P>
Let it be said at the outset--without hesitation and without qualification--Russell
Kirk was a great man. His work will stand as one of the most significant
intellectual achievements of our time. That is because he understood
our time. Before his most famous book, <i>The Conservative Mind</i>,
was accepted for publication, Russell Kirk wrote a letter to Henry
Regnery, saying: This work is &quot;my contribution to our endeavor
to conserve the spiritual and intellectual and political tradition
of our civilization; and if we a e to rescue the modem mind we
must do it very soon . . .The struggle will be decided in the
minds of the rising generation.&quot;
<P>
There can be no doubt that Russell Kirk reached many minds-- and
touched many hearts--over the last four decades. His words coursed
over the continents and across the generations. He touched us
not just because of what he said, but how he said it. This &quot;Bohemian
Tory,&quot; this &quot;Canny Scot,&quot; possessed an excellent
ear for the language, and his readers felt all the force of his
personality in his prose.
<P>
And then there were the many personal qualities that endeared
Russell Kirk to us. He was a loyal friend and a faithful correspondent.
Who could forget his keen wit, those fantastic ghost stories,
and that mischievous twinkle in his eyes? He was devoted to his
family--a wonderful family so many of us have come to know: his
lovely wife Annette, their four beautiful daughters, his sons-in-law,
and the larger family. For years they have opened their arms to
us, as today we open our arms to them.
<P>
Russell Kirk had an uncommonly generous spirit--a spirit that
never flagged, but gave tirelessly. It is evident in his letters
and lectures, his books and conversation. Weakened though he was
toward the end of his life, Dr. Kirk's last public gesture was
to sign books from his bed, because he knew how much that would
mean to his readers
and friends. The last book he signed, just a week before his passing,
vas to Governor Engler.
<P>
Russell Kirk was very much a Michigan man--one of us. We can imagine
him as a young boy, reading historical adventures by the train
yards in Plymouth where his father worked. We can think of him
as a gifted teacher at his alma mater, Michigan State. We can
see him walking out of that drafty old library at Piety Hill and
turning down the road which leads to the woods.
<P>
Russell loved Michigan. Recently his heart made its final journey
back to the &quot;stump country&quot; that he called his ancestral
home, to return to the land that shaped him. But his spirit now
knows its true and eternal home. And the wisdom in his writings
will remain to help those of us still on this earthly pilgrimage.
Indeed, for generations to come, his words will find a resting
place wherever there is right reason, and wherever there is a
heart in search of the Permanent Things.
<P>
Today we mourn. We have lost a friend. Michigan has lost its preeminent
man of letter. America has lost one of the men who understood
her best. We mourn, but Russell would not want us to become too
melancholy this day. In the epilogue of his memoirs, which he
recently composed and which will be published next year, Russell
Kirk tells us that he lived a good life. At the age of seventy-five,
he says that what he sought in life had come down to three things.
<P>
First, he had sought to defend the Permanent Things -- truth, justice,
freedom, a tolerable moral order and in so doing he was more successful
than he thought would be possible at the outset of his career.
<P>
Second, he had sought to lead a life of decent independence, living
much as his ancestors had lived, on their land, in circumstances
that would enable him to utter the truth and make his voice heard:
a life uncluttered and unpolluted, not devoted to getting and
spending. This, he tells us, he had achieved as a man of letters
at Piety Hill.
<P>
Third, he had sought to marry for love and to rear children who
would come to know that the service of God is perfect freedom.
Words cannot express how filled with gratitude he was for Annette
and his children, who are endowed with the unbought grace of life.
In this, too, he had been wonderfully blessed.
<P>
To Russell Kirk, the three goals of his life had been reached,
and he was grateful. And we who are here today can be grateful
that we knew him, and that he walked a little distance with us
in our journey to our eternal home.

<A NAME="pat"></A>
<A href="#index">Index</A> <CENTER><B>Pat Buchanan<BR>
Founder and Chairman <BR>
The American Cause</CENTER></b><p> We are here today to mourn the passing
of a wonderful friend, and to celebrate a great life, that of
Dr. Russell Kirk, Patriarch of Piety Hill, Sage of Mecosta, gentle
giant of American conservatism. And, I am proud and honored to
add, leader of the Buchanan Brigades in the Michigan primary of
'92.
<P>
In 1953, when Dr. Kirk's seminal work, The Conservative Mind,
appeared In a desert of liberal orthodoxy, it was celebrated,
not only here but across the West. For the wise men of the age
were aware something new had been born, a genuine conservative
movement, and Russell Kirk was its father. His was the spark that
set fire to the minds of so many of my generation.
<P>
For forty years, Dr. Kirk wrote his columns and commentaries,
essays, and stories, books and reviews- a treasure house of work
that now becomes part of the deposit of faith--of the cause in
which we believe. And his books will be read and reread and cherished,
when most of what his contemporaries published is long since forgotten.
Why?
<P>
Because Russell Kirk wrote not only for his time, but for all
time. He was the custodian, the caretaker of &quot;The Permanent
Things&quot;, the eternal truths that do not change. All his life
he wielded his pen to expose the false gods of modernity, and
in particular, the false god of ideology.
<P>
To Dr. Kirk, ideology, whether of Left or Right, was something
that took possession of a soul that was empty. &quot;Ideology,&quot;
he wrote, &quot;provides sham religion . . . comforting in its
way to those who have lost or never have known genuine religious
faith.&quot;
<P>
When Dr. Kirk discovered this heresy in the camp of the saints,
he used a needle to winkle it out. A few years back when the ideology
of democracy was being exalted to the status of high dogma, he
wrote, &quot;A trouble with this civil-religion notion is that
the large majority of Americans think they already have a religion
of their own, not one cobbled up by some department in Washington.&quot;
<P>
When some great minds arose in our midst to declare The End of
History, Dr. Kirk merrily laughed. Because he knew more history
than all of them put together; and because he knew that the seedbed
of conflicts and war lay in the human heart, which is unchanged
and unchanging, save through grace.
<P>
As the presence here today of Russell Kirk's wife and four daughters
so beautifully testifies, Russell Kirk did not simply preach the
values of family and faith, he lived them. He not only wrote of
the search for truth, he persevered all his life; and when he
came upon the truth in the Roman Catholic Church, Russell Kirk
embraced it. This was a man, whole and entire, whose hierarchy
of values were in perfect order and synchronization, as are the
planets in God's heaven that circle the sun. And because his values
were in harmony, Dr. Kirk was one off the most genuinely, visibly
happy men I have ever met.
<P>
I recall the last time we met, in Philadelphia near midnight for
a drink after a speech; Annette and Dr. Kirk invited me out to
Piety Hill, to see the library in which he took such joy.
<P>
And, upon occasion, Dr. Kirk would undertake my instruction.
<P>
After listening to me propound the latest economic nostrum for
America's ills, this gentle teacher sent me a slim book that contained
his own introduction: &quot;I have regarded with some suspicion
many practitioners of the Dismal Science,&quot; Dr. Kirk had written.
&quot;I have found economists a blindered breed, worshipping the
false god, Efficiency.&quot;
<P>
Dr. Kirk believed in a market economy, but all his life he fought
this Cult of Efficiency--because it dehumanized man; and because
he knew there is a higher order of things in God's universe, ruled
by a law higher even than the law of supply and demand.
<P>
If today a man should ask me what is conservatism, I would tell
him: Read Russell Kirk. He endures; he speaks to the ages of what
it means to be one of us.
<P>
If there is an image I will carry with me all my days of Dr. Kirk,
it is the image of the loving father of the Prodigal Son, the
father who; nightly, walks to the edge of his estate to look to
the horizon to see if his wandering boy is ever coming home again.
And when the son appears, disheveled, having squandered his patrimony
chasing after the fads and follies of the age, the gentle father,
never reproachful, rejoices to take his son back home.
<P>
He was that--to us.
<P>
&quot;Men are put into this world . . . to struggle, to suffer,
to contend against the evil that is in their neighbors, and in
themselves, and to aspire toward the triumph of Love,&quot; Russell
Kirk wrote forty years ago. &quot;They are put in this world to
live like men and to die like men.&quot;
<P>
A brave man all his life, Russell Kirk died like a man, passing
away in the arms of the wife and daughters he loved. <i>Ave atque vale</i>,
my friend.

1960s. But it might just as well have been aimed at all of us;
especially those of us who work in universities, think tanks,
and newspapers. Who among us knows so much as to offer the prospect
of any &quot;convincing&quot; alternative to an order long rooted
in the experience of a people? Our answer to this question will
determine how we understand the word &quot;conservative.&quot;</B>
<P>
We know how Russell Kirk answered the question. To his eternal
credit, he did not impart to this movement the name &quot;Kirkianism.&quot;
When he wrote <i>The Conservative Mind</i>, he certainly did not suggest
that the &quot;mind&quot; was his own. The whole point of the
book was to have the reader draw quite the opposite conclusion.
The permanent things are not known by merely one mind or party;
thanks to the gift of culture, they are known by many minds. Whether
we speak of culture in its moral and religious sense, or culture
in terms of liberty and economic markets, the conservative believes
that the kind of social order worth living in most certainly is
not something vouchsafed exclusively to a privileged class of
theorists.
<P>
Russell Kirk kept a distance, both spiritual and geographical,
from the institutions of the elite. He did most of his thinking
and writing outside of the academy. While it seems at least paradoxical
to say this about a conservative, he needed no institutional credentials
to certify his ideas. It was enough for him to call upon the authority
Cicero, Burke, and John Randolph of Roanoke. He certainly kept
a distance from the imperial institutions of this city. Except
for two terms as Justice of the Peace in Morton Township, Mecosta
County, Michigan, Russell never held public office.
<P>
Nonetheless, he had the chief virtue of a public man: he regarded
cultural order as a gift, even if it had been neglected and despoiled
by the age. One might think that it was a great misfortune for
him to have lived in our time, with its rejection of authority
and its rejection of the vicarious communion of the living with
the dead. Russell was, of course, duly critical of the age.
<P>
But criticism was rarely his first word, and never his last. 1
recall the first time I met him, during one of his annual seminars
at Piety Hill. I never, by the way, met a man of his prominence
who spent such time with young people, especially college undergraduates.
That year he was considering the subject, &quot;Is Virtue Teachable?&quot;
After citing all of the classical authorities, and making every
argument (pro and con) of which we were capable, we retired to
the living room on the final evening, whereupon Russell told ghost
stories. I returned more than once to these annual affairs in
Mecosta, and I can assure you that the ghosts always had the final
word.
<P>
When we consider the life of Russell Kirk, we may ask ourselves:
Can a virtuous man be happy in a decadent time? Aristotle said
of Priam's misfortunes: &quot;A truly good and intelligent person
will bear strokes of fortune suitably, and from his resources
at any time will do the finest actions, just as a . . . good shoemaker
will produce the finest shoe from the leather given him . . .
If this is so, then the happy person could never become miserable.&quot;
<P>
And so it was with Russell Kirk. &quot;Happiness,&quot; he concluded
in <i>The Roots of American Order</i>, is first expressed in &quot;gratitude.&quot;
Gratitude is found neither in sadness nor in protest, but in &quot;restoring
and improving the order of the soul and the order of the republic.&quot;
<P>
For his piety, for his example, for his paternal solicitude for
his students, and above all for his sanity, we will miss him.
But we. are grateful for his extraordinary defense of the ordinary,
civilizing virtues.<p><br><p><center><img alt="_______________________" align="middle"src="divide.gif"></center><p><br><p>

<A href="#index">Index</A> <CENTER><B>Irving Louis Horowitz<BR>
Professor of Sociology and Political Science<BR>
Rutgers University</b></CENTER><p> It would be futile, not to say frustrating,
to try summarizing Russell Kirk's life and work in a few well
chosen words. Russell him self was wise enough to leave for paradise
ultimate summaries and judgments. He understood that our world
was comprised, if not shrouded, in mystery and paradox; and hence
in need of dispositions not dogmas. He lived his extraordinary
life accordingly.
<P>
He was a huge public presence with a private life that remained
ever intact. He was a man who wrote fiercely, but who yet managed
to speak softly. Russell gave substance to a movement floundering
in search of theory, and yet only episodically participated in
partisan politics. He was as dedicated to what Veblen called the
higher learning with an unmatched ferocity, and yet chose the
life of what Mannheim called the <i>freischwebende Inelligenz</i> -- 
or loosely translated, the free-wheeling intellect. He was a political
philosopher in the strictest, Burkean, sense of the word, and
yet could produce ghost I stories and aphoristic works with equal
aplomb and ease. And yes, he was Catholic in the exacting sense
of that word, and yet fully able to register a catholicity that
knew no boundaries of religion or culture.
<P>
In short, he was one of us: a human being with aspirations no
less than accomplishments. His conservatism was ample enough to
take the measure of man as a complex bundle of twine; touched
by original sin but in search of ultimate redemption, and filled
with such tumult as to make possible an appreciation of order.
But having said this, one must add a qualifier: Russell did not
use paradox as a mechanism for avoiding decisions or skirting
issues. Better than nearly any I person I have ever known, he
took forthright positions on basic ques tions. For Russell, what
ought to be is at least as important as what is in the conduct
of human affairs.
<P>
I take this passion for the political as his secret war against
empiricism and for moralism. He was at heart, an essayist. He
loved preparing introductions to his favorite contemporary authors:
Irving Babbitt, Christopher Dawson, William H. Mallock, John Randolph,
Forrest McDonald, Donald Davidson, Wilhelm Roepke, Victor Kravchenko, Louis deBonald, George Scott-Moncrieff -- to name some of
them. They spoke at levels that provided meaning without fueling
animus.
<P>
I suspect that this opportunity to dialogue with his friends and
mentors of ages past no less than times present was a large part
of Russell's reason for sponsoring the Library of Conservative
Thought a series wthich has brought such distinction to Transaction,
 no less than pleasure to its readers. He shared with Montaigne
the deep belief that the essay form was that most amenable to
give I expression to ethical considerations. If this made him
at times appear I avuncular, it was a small price to pay for giving
intellectual shape to the struggles of our century and our nation.
<P>
Russell's life spanned much of the century: he knew many victories,
and suffered defeats as well. He handled both ends of the public
spectrum with equal equanimity. I suspect that the warmth of his
private life above all, his unabashed love and beaming pride of
his wife and four daughters allowed him to put into perspective
any indignities, and put into practice his belief in the values
of family, tradition, and faith. There was a seamless movement
from the private to the public that gave an informed unity of
purpose to his life.
<P>
In the short few weeks since his death, I have received many encomiums
about the Library of Conservative Thought. Several of them have
spoken of the series as somehow complete, or near completion,
with his passing. While well-intentioned, this is simply not the
case. That rich body of analysis to which Russell both contributed
so mightily and recovered so consistently, is no more near completion
than the planet earth itself. It would be high irony that a person
dedicated to the search for eternal values in a changing polity
would advocate or announce the competition of such a stupendous
task.
<P>
I suspect that these letters are giving expression to a feeling
of deep sorrow at the loss of a spiritual leader in a spiritless
environment. But the need for the comfort of belief, the instinct
for tradition, the impulse to maintain, if not create order, must
ultimately overcome our sorrow at the loss of a human being, however
talented and whatever achievements he may have registered. The
fact is that Russell is now one with the great tradition he helped
to articulate and recover. He is one with Plato, Augustine, Burke,
Brownson, Calhoun, Eliot and countless other names who helped
Russell give definition to western civilization. May his soul
rest in peace. May our souls remain restless in the pursuit of
peace.

<P>
<A href="#index">Index</A> <CENTER><B>Honorable T. Kenneth Cribb,
Jr.<BR>
President<BR>
Intercollegiate Studies Institute</b></CENTER><p> The priceless regalia
of the Scottish kings--the crown, the scepter, the sword of state--are
known as the Honors of Scotland. They are more ancient by far
than the British Crown Jewels, and it is said that the gold circlet
of the richly reworked crown was worn by Robert the Bruce. Despite
their incalculable worth, the Honors of Scotland were put away
following the union of the English and Scottish nations, and then
were lost to memory for 150 years.</B>
<P>
It was none other than Sir Walter Scott who, understanding their
significance, used all the powers of his scholarship and imagination
to deduce their forgotten resting place. After infinite pains,
he himself lifted the Honors of Scotland from the dusty recess
where they had been consigned by an earlier generation careless
of its patrimony.
<P>
In our age, it was Russell Kirk who, with ground-breaking scholarship
and moral imagination, rediscovered what we may call the Honors
of the West. At a time when the American heirs to conservatism
had fallen into forgetfulness of the great tradition, and liberal
intellectuals had proclaimed its demise, Dr. Kirk, like the Walter
Scott he so admired, lifted with his own hands our forgotten patrimony
from dusty oblivion.
<P>
In his early work Dr. Kirk treated modern exemplars of the conservative
tradition from Burke to Eliot, but always with respect to their
insights into timeless truths. Later, he more explicitly traced
these eternal verities to their ancient historical roots, and
to their Source beyond history. All along the way he erected guideposts
for those who would follow--all of us here and so many others--that
we too could travel the path he had marked toward order in the
soul and order in the commonwealth; that we too could discover
the Honors of the West.
<P>
Friend or foe would occasionally address him as Professor Kirk--not
realizing that he had held professorships no longer than he had
to--such was his contempt for Behemoth University. But teacher
he was, all his life. More than a few volumes on his long shelf
of books were written explicitly to instruct the young, not to
F mention hundreds of college lectures from coast to coast, scores
of Wilbur Fellows who served as his research assistants, or the
Piety Hill seminars begun more than twenty years ago. As with
Chaucer's Clerk, gladly would he teach and gladly learn.
<P>
Russell Kirk also taught by the example of his towering integrity.
Here was the man of letters who, without the usual sinecures,
actually lived by his pen. Here was the scourge of the Welfare
State who quietly practiced the arts of private charity. He and
Annette made their house a home to the troubled, to the dispossessed,
to great eccentrics seeking refuge from the commonplace world.
Who has not visited Piety Hill only to find himself dining with
the deposed imperial family of Ethiopia, or a young person with
grave family problems, or an intellectual expatriated from the
totalitarian East. There was even the Burglar Butler who before
finding shelter with the Kirks, made his way by robbing church
poor boxes, taking--as he said--only what was absolutely necessary.
<P>
Yes, Dr. Kirk taught us by the very nature of the household that
he established, graced by Monica, Cecilia, Felicia, and Andrea,
and presided over by Annette with an encompassing love.
<P>
In January of 1993 Russell Kirk learned that he suffered from
congestive heart failure, and realist that he was, understood
that his remaining time was short. He took the news as no more
and no less than an artifact of the human condition, and in his
last year and-a-half neither despaired in his spirit nor flagged
in his Herculean literary feats. After all, this was a man who
measured his intellectual pursuits in millennia and who planted
trees throughout his life as a symbol of our duty to strive for
good that we may not live to see.
<P>
Well into his seventies, Dr. Kirk could canoe on the rivers of
Mecosta County or walk the hills of the Scottish Borders, only
to sit down later at his typewriter and engage in learned disputation.
This past December nineteenth, Dr. Kirk wrote me, &quot;I fear
that my days of canoeing and hill-walking are over,&quot; and
then proceeded to outline a series of literary projects that daunted
even in the reading. Since the onset of his illness in 1993, he
had produced two of his most important works: <i>America's British
Culture</i>, a consummate defense of our common patrimony against
the destructive sallies of the multiculturalists; and <i>The Politics
of Prudence</i>, a series of essays instructing the rising generation
in the essence of conservative thought and exhorting them to nurture
and transmit their precious cultural heritage.
<P>
But perhaps the most significant work of his last days was the
completion of his final literary gift to us, <i>The Sword
of Imagination: Memoirs of a Half-Century of Literary Conflict</i>.
This 874-page treasure of a manuscript is currently being prepared
for publication by Eerdmans Publishing Company and, according
to Dr. Kirk, is a memoir humbly penned in the tradition of Julius
Caesar and Henry T Adams.
<P>
During his final illness, Dr. Kirk would gather his daughters
around him to tell stories of his youth and of their family history--as
well as an occasional gothic tale. He mustered the energy to read
aloud to his family Walter Scott's <i>Tales of a Grandfather</i>,
and, on Easter Sunday, Chesterton's <i>Ballad of the White
Horse</i>;.
<P>
On his last morning, he heard on the radio that the Pope had slipped
and fallen. He asked his family to pin him in prayer for the Holy
Father's recovery. At the end, he sat up in his bed at his beloved
Piety Hill, and sank back with eyes closed. As Annette went for
the nurse, two of his young daughters took his hands and began
to sing the songs he had sung to awaken them from their a slumbers.
He opened his eyes once more to the angelic voices that sang him
to his rest. His life was gentle in the old sense; his death,
in all senses.
<P>
The final works and days of Russell Kirk were at one with his
long life. From across the ages the best minds of the West spoke
to Dr. Kirk of permanent things which eclipsed the paltry preoccupations
of our time, and he made those thinkers our contemporaries. It
is across the ages that Russell Kirk's own voice will be heard
by future voyagers embarked on the reflective journey toward order
in the soul and order in the commonwealth. May they redeem for
their time, as Russell Kirk has done for ours, the Honors of the
West.

<A href="#index">Index</A> <CENTER><B>Homily for the Memorial
Mass of Dr. Russell Kirk<BR>
Reverend Winthrop Brainerd<BR>
St. Matthew's Cathedral, Washington, D.C. </CENTER></B>
<P>
On Sunday we celebrated Pentecost, and on Monday, I was at Yale
graduation. The contrast between them was extreme. Certainly at
Yale I discovered much knowledge. Certainly at Yale, I discovered
much learning. Yet, with all of this knowledge and learning, was
the lack of moral imagination; and in the midst of &quot;political
correctness,&quot; the refusal of the truth; and therefore the
absence of all wisdom.
<P>
Certainly, there was much talk of &quot;freedom from,&quot; and
lamentably little understanding of &quot;freedom to:&quot; a multiplication
of rights; and a convenient amnesia of duty.
<P>
Yet as Pentecost reminds us, the vocation of a Catholic is to
witness to the truth. To this end, God reveals Himself in covenant;
in sacrifice; in flesh and blood; and through the Holy Spirit.
<P>
Poured out upon the Church at Pentecost, and upon us at our baptism,
that Spirit leads us into the truth, and as we discover the truth,
if we are to live our lives with integrity, we must proclaim it.
<P>
For it is in this fearless proclamation of truth, that we ourselves
learn: from each other; from tradition; from grace; and from that
radical transformation of the heart. Truth comes from the entirety
of the human condition and has been refined and forged in the
inner conflicts between truth and lies; between good and evil;
between the world and the kingdom. And from the proclamation of
the truth, we discover wisdom.
<P>
Given the corruption of human nature, it is, perhaps, too much
to expect gratitude from those challenged and exposed by the proclamation
of the truth, but in the midst of persecution, explicit or implicit,
we see &quot;<i>Cor ad Cor loquitur</i>,&quot; heart speaks to heart.
Like the rim of a bell, it does not matter where it is touched,
for it rings clear, out across the earth. Wisdom speaks heart
to heart, because it perceives not only truth, but the purpose
of truth, which is God.
<P>
Wisdom speaks to the human: body, soul, mind, for wisdom both
understands the truth of the human condition, and is the ground
of its healing. It mines the individual he art for the good for
which humanity was made; for the good of which it is capable;
and for that fragile good confronted by the dark destructive selfishness
of which each one of us is daily tempted to succumb.
<P>
Such wisdom comes from God who is wisdom Himself; Himself the
author, the purpose and the end and it is the birthright of every
Catholic.
<P>
Here in the presence of the author of truth and seat of wisdom
we are given a sign: we see the bread and wine; we perceive the
flesh and blood. We see in what we have made, in bread, in wine,
the seeds of our mortality: the bread must rot and the wine spoil.
Yet we see God take what we have made, and by them, give to us
immortality.
<P>
This sign shows us what God will do, not with what we have made,
but with what he has made: ourselves. &quot;Now we see a dim reflection
in a mirror; but then we shall be seeing face to face. The knowledge
that I now have is imperfect; but I shall understand as I am understood.&quot;
(1 Cor. 13:12)
<P>
&quot;To understand as I am understood&quot; is the ultimate wisdom.
It is still the vocation of our brother Russell Kirk; it is the
lesson of his life; and it is the legacy, like Elijah's mantle,
that falls upon us here.<p><br><p><center><img alt="_______________________" align="middle"src="divide.gif"></center>

<P>
Sobering voices tell us nowadays that the civilization in which we participate is not long for this world. Many countries have fallen under the domination of squalid oligarchs; other lands are reduced to anarchy. "Cultural revolution," rejecting our patrimony of learning and manners, has done nearly as much mischief in the West as in the East, if less violently. Religious belief is attenuated at best, for many or else converted, after being secularized, into an instrument for social transformation. Books give way to television and videos; universities, intellectually democratized, are sunk to the condition of centers for job certification. An increasing proportion of the population, in America especially, is dehumanized by addiction to narcotics and insane sexuality.
<p>
These afflictions are only some of the symptoms of social and personal disintegration. One has but to look at our half-ruined American cities, with their ghastly rates of murder and rape, to perceive that we moderns lack the moral imagination and the right reason required to maintain tolerable community. Writers in learned quarterlies or in daily syndicated columns use the terms "post-Christian era" or "post-modern epoch" to imply that we are breaking altogether with our cultural past, and are entering upon some new age of a bewildering character.
<p>
Some people, the militant secular humanists in particular, seem pleased by this prospect; but yesteryear's meliorism is greatly weakened in most quarters. Even Marxist ideologues virtually have ceased to predict the approach of a Golden Age. To most observers, T. S. Eliot among them, it has seemed far more probable that we are stumbling into a new Dark Age, inhumane, merciless, a totalist political domination in which the life of spirit and the inquiring intellect will be denounced, harassed, and propagandized against: Orwell's <I>Nineteen Eight-Four,</I> rather than Huxley's <i>Brave New World</i> of cloying sensuality. Or perhaps Tolkien's blasted and servile land of Mordor may serve as symbol of the human condition in the twenty-first century (which, however, may not be called the twenty-first century, the tag Anno Domini having been abolished as joined to one of the superstitions of the childhood of the race).
<p>
<b>At the End of an Era.</b> Some years ago I was sitting in the parlor of an ancient house in the close of York Minster. My host, Basil Smith, the Minster's Treasurer then, a man of learning and of faith, said to me that we linger at the end of an era; soon the culture we have known will be swept into the dustbin of history. About us, as we talked in that medieval mansion, loomed Canon Smith's tall bookcases lined with handsome volumes; his doxological clock chimed the half-hour musically; flames flared up in his fireplace. Was all this setting of culture, and much more besides, to vanish away as if the Evil Spirit had condemned it? Basil Smith is buried now, and so is much of the society he ornamented and tried to redeem. At the time I thought him too gloomy; but already a great deal that he foresaw has come to pass.
<p>
The final paragraph of Malcolm Muggeridge's essay 'The Great Liberal Death Wish" must suffice, the limits of my time with you considered, as a summing-up of the human predicament at the end of the twentieth century.
<p>
"As the astronauts soar into the vast eternities of space," Muggeridge writes, "on earth the garbage piles higher, as the groves of academe extend their domain, their alumni's arms reach lower, as the phallic cult spreads, so does impotence. In great wealth, great poverty; in health, sickness, in numbers, deception. Gorging, left hungry; sedated, left restless; telling all, hiding all; in flesh united, forever separate. So we press on through the valley of abundance that leads to the wasteland of satiety, passing through the gardens of fantasy; seeking happiness ever more ardently, and finding despair ever more surely."
<p>
Just so. Such recent American ethical writers as Stanley Hauwerwas and Alasdair MacIntyre concur in Muggeridge's verdict on the society of our time, concluding that nothing can be done, except for a remnant to gather in little "communities of character" while society slides toward its ruin. Over the past half-century, many other voices of reflective men and women have been heard to the same effect. Yet let us explore the question of whether a reinvigoration of our culture is conceivable.
<p>
<b>Surprise Turning Points.</b> Is the course of nations inevitable? Is there some fixed destiny for great states? In 1796, a dread year for Britain, old Edmund Burke declared that we cannot foresee the future; often the historical determinists are undone by the coming of events that nobody has predicted. At the very moment when some states "seemed plunged in unfathomable abysses of disgrace and disaster ' Burke wrote in his <i>First Letter on a Regicide Peace,</I> "they have suddenly emerged. They have begun a new course, and opened a new reckoning; and even in the depths of their calamity, and on the very ruins of their country, have laid the foundations of a towering and durable greatness. All this has happened without any apparent previous change in the general circumstances which had brought on their distress. The death of a man at a critical juncture, his disgust, his retreat, his disgrace, have brought innumerable calamities on a whole nation. A common soldier, a child, a girl at the door of an inn, have changed the face of fortune, and almost of Nature."
<p>
The "common soldier" to whom Burke refers is Arnold of Winkelreid, who flung himself upon the Austrian spears to save his country; the child is the young Hannibal, told by his father to wage ruthless war upon Rome; the girl at the door of an inn is Joan of Arc. We do not know why such abrupt reversals or advances occur, Burke remarks; perhaps they are indeed the work of Providence.
<p>
"Nothing is, but thinking makes it so," the old adage runs. If most folk come to believe that our culture must collapse-why, then collapse it will. Yet Burke, after all, was right in that dreadful year of 1796. For despite the overwhelming power of the French revolutionary movement in that year, in the long run Britain defeated her adversaries, and after the year 1812 Britain emerged from her years of adversity to the height of her power. Is it conceivable that American civilization, and in general what we call "Western Civilization," may recover from the Time of Troubles that commenced in 1914 (so Arnold Toynbee instructs us) and in the twenty-first century enter upon an Augustan age of peace and restored order?
<p>
To understand these words "civilization" and "culture," the best book to read is T. S. Eliot's slim volume <i>Notes Towards the Definition of Culture,</I> published forty-four years ago.
<p>
Once upon a time I commended that book to President Nixon, in a private discussion of modern disorders, as the one book which he ought to read for guidance in his high office. Man is the only creature possessing culture, as distinguished from instinct; and if culture is effaced, so is the distinction between man and the brutes that perish. "Art is man's nature," in Edmund Burke's phrase; and if the human arts, or culture, cease to be, then human nature ceases to be.
<p>
From what source did humankind's many cultures arise? Why, from cults. A cult is a joining together for worship-that is, the attempt of people to commune with a transcendent power. It is from association in the cult, the body of worshippers, that human community grows. This basic truth has been expounded in recent decades by such eminent historians as Christopher Dawson, Eric Voegelin, and Arnold Toynbee.
<p>
Once people are joined in a-cult, cooperation in many other things becomes possible. Common defense, irrigation, systematic agriculture, architecture, the visual arts, music, the more intricate crafts, economlc production and distribution, courts and government-all these aspects of a culture arise gradually from the cult, the religious de.
<p>
Out of little knots of worshippers, in Egypt, the Fertile Crescent, India, or China, there grew up simple cultures; for those joined by religion can dwell together and work together in relative peace. Presently such simple cultures may develop into intricate cultures, and those intricate cultures into great civilizations. American civilization of our era is rooted, strange though the fact may seem to us, in tiny knots of worshippers in Palestine, Greece, and Italy, thousands of years ago. The enormous material achievements of our civilization have resulted, if remotely, from the spiritual insights of prophets and seers.
<p>
But suppose that the cult withers, with the elapse of centuries. What then of the culture that is rooted in the cult? What then of the civilization which is the culture's grand manifestation? For an answer to such uneasy questions, we can turn to a twentieth century parable. Here I think of G. K Chesterton's observation that all life being an allegory, we can understand it only in parable.
<p>
<b>Parable of the Future.</b> The author of my parable, however, is not Chesterton, but a quite different writer, the late Robert Graves, whom I once visited in Mallorca I have in mind Graves's romance <i>Seven Days in New Crete</I>-published in America under the title <I>Watch the North Wind Rise.</i>
<p>
In that highly readable romance of a possible future, we are told that by the close of the "Late Christian epoch" the world will have fallen altogether, after a catastrophic war and devastation, under a collectivistic domination, a variant of Communism. Religion, the moral imagination, and nearly everything that makes life worth living have been virtually extirpated by ideology and nuclear war. k system of thought and government called Logicalism, "pantisocratic economics divorced from any religious or national theory," rules the world-for a brief time.
<p>
In Graves's words:
<p><blockquote>
Logicalism, hinged on international science, ushered in a gloomy and anti-poetic age. It lasted only a generation or two and ended with a grand defeatism, a sense of perfect futility, that slowly crept over the directors and managers of the regime. The common man had triumphed over his spiritual betters at last, but what was to follow? To what could he look forward with either hope or fear? By the abolition of sovereign states and the disarming of even the police forces, war had become impossible. No one who cherished any religious beliefs whatever, or was interested in sport, poetry, or the arts, was allowed to hold a position of public responsibility. "Ice-cold logic" was the most valued civic quality, and those who could not pretend to it were held of no account. Science continued laboriously to expand its over-large corpus of information, and the subjects of research grew more and more beautifully remote and abstract; yet the scientific obsession, so strong at the beginning of the third millennium A. D., was on the wane. Logicalist officials who were neither defeatist nor secretly religious and who kept their noses to the grindstone from a sense of duty, fell prey to colobromania, a mental disturbance....
</blockquote><p>
<p>
Rates of abortion and infanticide, of suicide, and other indices of social boredom rise with terrifying speed under this Logicalist regime. Gangs of young people go about robbing, beating, and murdering, for the sake of excitement. It appears that the human race will become extinct if such tendencies continue; for men and women find life not worth living under such a domination. The deeper longings of humanity have been outraged, so that the soul and the state stagger on the verge of final darkness. But in this crisis an Israeli Sophocrat writes a book called <i>A Critique of Utopias,</I> in which he examines seventy Utopian writings, from Plato to Aldous Huxley. "We must retrace our steps," he concludes, "or perish." Only by the resurrection of religious faith, the Sophocrats discover, can mankind be kept from total destruction; and that religion, as Graves describes it in his romance, springs from the primitive soil of myth and symbol.
<p>
Graves really is writing about our own age, not of some remote future: of life in today's United States and today's Soviet Union. He is saying that culture arises from the cult; and that when belief in the cult has been wretchedly enfeebled, the culture will decay swiftly. The material order rests upon the spiritual order.
<p>
So it has come to pass, here in the closing years of the twentieth century. With the weakening of the moral order, "Things fall apart; mere anarchy is loosed upon the world ... " The Hellenic and the Roman cultures went down to dusty death after this fashion. What may be done to achieve reinvigoration?
<p>
<b>No Substitute.</b> Some well-meaning folk talk of a "civil religion," a kind of cult of patriotism, founded upon a myth of national virtue and upon veneration of certain historic documents, together with a utilitarian morality. But such experiments of a secular character never have functioned satisfactorily; and it scarcely is necessary for me to point out the perils of such an artificial creed, bound up with nationalism: the example of the ideology of the National Socialist Party in Germany, half a century ago, may suffice. Worship of the state, or of the national commonwealth, is no healthy substitute for communion with transcendent love and wisdom.
<p>
Nor can attempts at persuading people that religion is "useful" meet with much genuine success. No man sincerely goes down on his knees to the divine because he has been told that such rituals lead to the beneficial consequences of tolerably honest behavior in commerce. People will conform their actions to the precepts of religion only when they earnestly believe the doctrines of that religion to be true.
<p>
Still less can it suffice to assert that the Bible is an infallible authority on everything, literally interpreted, in defiance of the natural sciences and of other learned disciplines; to claim to have received private revelations from Jehovah; or to embrace some self-proclaimed mystic from the gorgeous East, whose teachings are patently absurd.
<p>
In short, the culture can be renewed only if the cult is renewed; and faith in divine power cannot be summoned up merely when that is found expedient. Faith no longer works wonders among us: one has but to glance at the typical church built nowadays, ugly and shoddy, to discern how architecture no longer is nurtured by the religious imagination. It is so in nearly all d e works of twentieth century civilization: the modern mind has been secularized so thoroughly that "culture" is assumed by most people to have no connection with the love of God.
<p>
How are we to account for this widespread decay of the religious impulse? It appears that the principal cause of the loss of the idea of the holy is the attitude called "scientism"-that is, the popular notion that the revelations of natural science, over the past century and a half or two centuries, somehow have proved that men and women are naked apes merely, that the ends of existence are production and consumption merely; that happiness is the gratification of sensual impulses; and that concepts of the resurrection of the flesh and the life everlasting are mere exploded superstitions. Upon these scientistic assumptions, public schooling in America is founded nowadays, implicitly.
<p>
This view of the human condition has been called-by C S. Lewis, in particular-reductionism: it reduces human beings almost to mindlessness; it denies the existence of the soul. Reductionism has become almost an ideology. It is scientistic, but not scientific: for it is a far cry from the understanding of matter and energy that one finds in the addresses of Nobel prize winners in physics, say.
<p>
Popular notions of "what science says" are archaic :, reflecting the assertions of the scientists of the middle of the nineteenth century; such views are a world away from the writings of Stanley Jaki, the cosmologist and historian of science, who was awarded the Templeton Prize for progress in religion last year.
<p>
As Arthur Koestler remarks in his little book <i>The Roots of Coincidence,</I> yesterday's scientific doctrines of materialism and mechanism ought to be buried now with a requiem of electronic music. Once more, in biology as in physics, the scientific disciplines enter upon the realm of mystery.
<p>
Yet the great public always suffers from the affliction called cultural lag. If most people continue to fancy that scientific theory of a century ago is the verdict of serious scientists today, will not the religious understanding of life continue to wither, and civilization continue to crumble?
<p>
<b>Hard Truth.</b> Perhaps; but the future, I venture to remind you, is unknowable. Conceivably we may be given a Sign. Yet such an event being in I he hand of God, if it is to occur at all, meanwhile some reflective people declare that our culture must be reanimated, by a great effort of will.
<p>
More than forty years ago, that remarkable historian Christopher Dawson, in his book <i>Religion and Culture,</I> expressed this hard truth strongly. "The events of the last few years," Dawson wrote, "portend either the end of human history or a turning point in it. They have warned us in letters of fire that our civilization has been tried in the balance and found wanting-that there is an absolute limit to the progress than can be achieved by the perfectionment of scientific techniques detached from spiritual aims and moral values.... The recovery of moral control and the return to spiritual order have become the indispensable conditions of human survival. But they can be achieved only by a profound change in the spirit of modern civilization. This does not mean a new religion or a new culture but a movement of spiritual reintegration which would restore that vital relation between religion and culture which has existed at every age and on every level of human development."
<p>
Amen to that. The alternative to such a successful endeavor, a conservative endeavor, to reinvigorate our culture would be a series of catastrophic events, the sort predicted by Pitirim Sorokin and other sociologists, which eventually might efface our present sensate culture and bring about a new ideational culture, the character of which we cannot even imagine. Such an ideational culture doubtless would have its religion: but it might be the worship of what has been called the Savage God
<p>
Such ruin has occurred repeatedly in history. When the classical religion ceased to move hearts and minds, two millennia ago, thus the Graeco Roman civilization went down to Avernus. As my little daughter Cecilia put it unprompted, some years ago looking at a picture book of Roman history, "And then, at the end of a long summer's day, there came Death, Mud, Crud."
<p>
Great civilizations have ended in slime. Outside the ancient city of York, where York Minster stands upon the site of the Roman praetorium, there lies a racecourse known as the Knavesmire. Here in medieval time were buried the knaves-the felons and paupers. When, a few years ago, the racecourse was being enlarged, the diggers came upon a Roman graveyard beneath, or in part abutting upon, the medieval burial ground. This appeared to have been a cemetery of the poor of Romano-British times. Few valuable artifacts were uncovered, but the bones were of interest. Many of the people there interred, in the closing years of Roman power in Britain, had been severely deformed, apparently suffering from rickets and other afflictions-deformed spines and limbs and skulls. Presumably they had suffered lifelong, and died, from extreme malnutrition. At the end, decadence comes down to that, for nearly everybody.
<p>
It was at York that the dying Septimius Severus, after his last campaign (against the Scots), was asked by his brutal sons, Geta and Caracalla, "Father, when you are gone, how shall we govern the empire?" The hard old emperor had his laconic reply ready: "Pay the soldiers. The rest do not matter." There would come a time when the soldiers could not be paid, and then civilization would fall to pieces. The last Roman army in Italy-it is said to have been composed entirely of cavalry- fought in league with the barbarian general Odoacer against Theodoric, King of the Ostrogoths, in the year 491; on Odoacer's defeat, the Roman soldiers drifted home, nevermore to take arms: the end of an old song Only the earlier stages of social decadence-seem liberating to some people; the last act, as Cecilia Kirk perceived, consists of Death, Mud, Crud.
<p>
In short, it appears to me that our culture labors in an advanced state of decadence; that what many people mistake for the triumph of our civilization actually consists of powers that are disintegrating our culture; that the vaunted "democratic freedom" of liberal society in reality is servitude to appetites and illusions which attack religious belief; which destroy community through excessive centralization and urbanization; which efface life-giving tradition and custom.
<p>
<blockquote>
History has many cunning passages, contrieved corridors <BR>And issues, deceives with whispering ambitions, <BR>Guides us by vanities.
</blockquote>
<p>
So Gerontion instructs us, in T. S. Eliot's famous grim poem. By those and some succeeding lines, Eliot means that human experience lived without the Logos, the Word; lived merely by the asserted knowledge of empirical science-why, history in that sense is a treacherous gypsy witch. Civilizations that reject or abandon the religious imagination must end, as did Gerontion, in fractured atoms.
<p>
<b>Restoring Religious Insights.</b> In conclusion, it is my argument that the elaborate civilization we have known stands in peril; that it may expire of lethargy, or be destroyed by violence, or perish, from a combination of both evils. We who think that life remains worth living ought to address ourselves to means by which a restoration of our culture may be achieved. A prime necessity for us is to restore an apprehension of religious insights in our clumsy apparatus of public instruction, which -bullied by militant secular humanists and presumptuous federal courts-has been left with only ruinous answers to the ultimate questions.
<p>
What ails modern civilization? Fundamentally, our society's affliction is the decay of religious belief If a culture is to survive and flourish, it must not be severed from the religious vision out of which it arose. The high necessity of reflective men and women, then, is to labor for the restoration of religious teachings as a credible body of doctrine.
<p>
"Redeem the time; redeem the dream," T. S. Eliot wrote. It remains possible, given right reason and moral imagination, to confront boldly the age's disorders. The restoration of true learning, humane and scientific; the reform of many public policies; the renewal of our awareness of a transcendent order, and of the presence of an Other, the brightening of the comers where we find ourselves such approaches are open to those among the rising generation who look for a purpose in life. It is just conceivable that we may be given a Sign before the end of the twentieth century; yet Sign or no Sign, Remnant must strive against the follies of the time.

<P>
The literature of natural law is complex, copious, and monthly growing vaster. All I aspire to accomplish in this second lecture on "The Future of Justice" is to offer some general introduction to the subject, together with reflections on the protections and dangers of natural-law doctrines, and observations concerning natural law and constitutional government.
<p>
A great deal of loose talk about natural law has occurred in very recent years. It was objected to Judge Bork' s nomination to the Supreme Court that Bork did not believe in natural law; and when Judge Thomas was interrogated for that bench, the objection was raised that he <i>did</i> believe in natural law. These protestations came mostly from the same group of senators. Clearly a good many public men and women nowadays have only vague notions of what is signified by this term <i>natural law.</i>
<p>
Objectively speaking, <i>natural law,</i> as a term of politics and jurisprudence, may be defined as a loosely knit body of rules of action prescribed by an authority superior to the state. These rules variously (according to the several differing schools of natural-law and natural-rights speculation) are derived from divine commandment; from the nature of humankind; from abstract Reason; or from long experience of mankind in community.
<p>
But natural law does not appertain to states and courts merely. For primarily it is a body of ethical perceptions or rules governing the life of the individual person, quite aside from politics and jurisprudence. When many persons ignore or flout the natural law for human beings, the consequences presently are ruinous-as with the unnatural vices that result in the disease of AIDS, or with the ideological passions, defying the norm of justice, that have ravaged most nations since the First World War.
<p>
The natural law should not be taken for graven Tables of Governance, to be followed to jot and tittle; appealed to in varying circumstances, the law of nature must be applied with high prudence. As Alessandro d'Entreves writes, "The lesson of natural law is in fact nothing but an assertion that law is a part of ethics." And, he concludes "The lesson of natural law [is] simply to remind the jurist of his own limitations.... This point where values and norms coincide, which is the ultimate origin of law and at the same time the beginning of moral life proper, is, I believe, what men for over two thousand years have indicated by the name of natural law."
<p>
On the one hand, natural law must be distinguished from positive or statutory law, decreed by the state; on the other, from the "laws of nature" in a scientific sense-that is, from propositions expressing the regular order of certain natural phenomena Also natural law sometimes is confounded with assertions of "natural rights," which may or may not be founded upon classical and medieval concepts of natural law.
<p>
The most important early treatise on natural law is Cicero's <i>De Re Publica.</i> The Ciceronian understanding of natural law, which still exercises strong influence, was well expressed in the nineteenth century by Froude: "Our human laws are but the copies, more or less imperfect, of the eternal laws so far as we can read them, and either succeed and promote our welfare, or fail and bring confusion and disaster, according as the legislator's insight has detected the true principle, or has been distorted by ignorance or selfishness."
<p>
As interpreted by the Roman jurisconsult, and later by the medieval Schoolmen and Canonists- Thomas Aquinas especially-the legacy of the classical <i>jus naturale</i> endured with little challenge until the seventeenth century. In England during the sixteenth century it was powerfully upheld by Richard Hooker in his <i>Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity.</i> In the Christian world the natural law was received as a body of unwritten rules depending upon universal conscience and common sense, ascertainable by right reason. But with the stirrings of secularism and rationalism during the seventeenth century, a new interpretation of "natural law" began to develop, conspicuous (near the end of the century) in the works of Hugo Grotius and Baron Samuel von Pufendorf. This latter secularized concept of natural law was held by many of the <i>philosophes</i> of the eighteenth century, and took on flesh during the French Revolution, when it was vulgarized by Thomas Paine.
<p>
Nevertheless, the older understanding of natural law was not extinguished. It was ringingly reasserted by Edmund Burke, in his distinction between the "real" and the "pretended" rights of men. Through the disciples of Burke, and through the influence of the Catholic Church, the classical and Christian natural law has experienced a revival in the latter half of the twentieth century.
<p>
During the nineteenth century, natural-law concepts were overshadowed by the powerful Utilitarian system of Jeremy Bentham; by the theories of John Austin and the Analytical Jurists; by legal positivism; and later-particularly in the United States-by legal pragmatism. In the United States, the older and newer schools of natural law have contended against each other since the latter half of the eighteenth century, and both have been hotly assailed by positivistic, utilitarian, and pragmatic interpretations of law. Yet appeals to the "natural law" or "a higher law" have recurred often in American politics and jurisprudence; both conservatives and radicals, from time to time, have invoked this law of nature
<p>
The Catholic Church continues to adhere to the classical and Thomistic understanding of the natural law-to an apprehension of Justice that is rooted in the wisdom of the species. Sir Ernest Barker put thus the idea of natural law: "This justice is conceived as being the higher or ultimate law, proceeding from the nature of the universe from the Being of God and the reason of man. It follows that law-in the sense of the law of the last resort-is somehow above lawmaking."
<p>
The most lucid and popular exposition of natural law it to be found in the Appendix, "Illustrations of the Tao," to C. S. Lewis's little book <i>The Abolition of Man.</i> Therein Lewis distinguishes eight major natural laws of universal recognition and application, together with several illustrations of each, drawn from a wide diversity of cultures, religions, philosophical discourses, and countries. He expounds the Law of General Beneficence; the Law of Special Beneficence; Duties to Parents, Elders, Ancestors; Duties to Children and Posterity; the Law of Justice; the Law of Good Faith and Veracity; the Law of Mercy; the Law of Magnanimity. No code of the laws of nature ever having existed, it is ineffectual to try to enforce that body of ethical principles through courts of law; no judge hands down decisions founded directly upon the admonition, "Honor thy father and thy mother, that thy days may be long in the land"-or the Commandment's equivalents in the Babylonian List of Sins, the Egyptian Confession of the Righteous Soul, the Manual of Epictetus, Leviticus, the Analects, or Hindu books of wisdom. Nevertheless, such perpetual precepts lie behind the customs and the statutes that shelter father and mother.
<p>
So much, succinctly, by way of definition. Turn we now to the difficulty of explaining natural law to the average sensual man. Permit me to discourse with you for a little while about natural law and the moral imagination. Incidentally, I am helped here by an unpublished essay by the late Raymond English, who understood and praised the natural law, and understood and despised the claims for "natural right." Let me quote English directly:
<p><blockquote>
The natural law cannot be understood except through the elements of poetry and imagination in the soul. The poetic and the moral imagination are parts of human reason. For the man who does not feel himself in some sense a child of God, who is not possessed by the "desire and pursuit of the whole," and for whom words like honor are meaningless, the notion of natural law must be a Mumbojumbo, a bogle to make children behave tolerably well, a fantasy from the adolescence or the childhood of the race. Poets, James Elroy Flecker says, are those who swear that Beauty lives although lilies die; and the natural law is the poetry of political science, the assurance that Justice lives though states are imperfect and ephemeral. Justice is to politics what beauty is to art; indeed, beauty and justice become almost identical at the highest levels of human aspiration.
</blockquote><p>
Permit me, ladies and gentlemen, to repeat here that the natural law is more than a guide for statesmen and jurists. It is meant primarily for the governance of persons-for you and me, that we may restrain will and appetite in our ordinary walks of life. Natural law is not a harsh code that we thrust upon other people: rather, it is an ethical knowledge, innate perhaps, but made more clearly known to us through -the operation of right reason. And the more imagination with which a person is endowed, the more will he apprehend the essence of the natural law, and understand its necessity. If such a one, despite his power of imagination, offends against the natural law, the greater must be his suffering. So I have discovered in the course of a peregrine life. And over a good many decades I have found that most contemners of the natural law are dull dogs, afflicted by a paucity of imagination. As Adam Mickiewicz instructs us:
<p><blockquote>
Your soul deserves the place to which it came,<br>If having entered Hell, you feel no flame.
</blockquote><p>
Such is the case for the importance of natural law. Permit me to turn now to the case against natural law, as expressed by the legal positivists-most strongly, perhaps, by the German scholar Hans Kelsen. They regard natural law as a body of sentimental fictions; they hold that the state is the only true source of law. The views of John Austin and the Analytical Jurists are similar: all law is decreed by the political sovereign, they hold. Rather than moving abstractly among the several schools of jurisprudence in the twentieth century, I offer you now the contents of a letter I received recently from a German inventor and industrialist who had read in the Bavarian magazine <i>Epoche</i> some remarks of mine on natural law. My correspondent is a very intelligent and indeed talented man, considerable of a naturalist in that he studies flora and fauna. In politics, I suppose he may be classified as a German liberal of the old school. His communication, refreshingly innocent of the jargon of jurisprudence and ethics, suggests the mentality that lies behind the denigration of natural law by positivists and secular humanists, who recognize and deride the Christian and the classical origins of the idea of natural law.
<p>
"Whether the term 'law of nature' is more frequently used nowadays, or whether the <i>jus naturale</i> is an old invention," my German correspondent begins, "I think this term is wrong and misleading. There is no law or legislative system which can be derived from nature. Nature has rules developed during evolution, but there is only a <i>jus hominis</i> and no <i>jus naturale."</I>
<p>
"In other words," my friend goes on, 
<p><blockquote>
all ethical norms are developed and worked out by human beings, in this case mostly by the homo stultus, subspecies sapiens.... The order of nature follows in many respects the right of the stronger, which, in fact, keeps nature with all its plants and animals in excellent shape. But mankind has set up ethical rules, good ones and bad ones, very different from natural rules. Many of these man-made rules are quite bad, sinning against nature....
<P>
The very deplorable situation of the species homo stultus comes from wrong ethical rules, which are against nature. I am not pleading for the right of the stronger between human beings, but for more influence of the rare subspecies sapiens, especially of those individuals who understand nature-which means also the nature of human character. Unfortunately Jesus did not understand the real nature of men; nor do the socialists understand it when they expect that people will work for the state rather than for themselves....
<P>
I offer another example, in which American legislators have chosen the wrong solution. There is a law in the United States, if I am correct, which forbids the killing of foreign heads of state. If I am correct this is concerned with clandestine actions, e.g. by the CIA. This law is unethical. Assuming that no American president or the American government plans to eliminate a foreign dictator just for fun, but rather because he is a danger to the United States or to his own people or both, then removing a dictator as soon as possible would save the lives of many; and is, in consequence, completely justified.
<P>
We should agree that right is an exclusively human creation. What is regarded as rightful by one group of people within a community, can be regarded as wrongful by another group. I seek a terminology where there is a clean and clear distinction between what comes from nature and what comes from human efforts. Human efforts are aimed very often, with the best intentions, in the wrong direction. I mean "wrong" in this sense: against nature, for nature cannot be neglected without harming the human race....
<P>
Failing to realize that often human character is bad must lead to destroying a society through leniency. We have to determine when our ethical laws accord with nature and when they counteract nature. We must not ignore "the rule of the fittest," when we decide to kill a dictator, for instance. We acknowledge the right of every nation to use as much force as possible when fighting another nation to death. The fight between nations follows what could be called natural right, but is better called the rule of nature.
</blockquote><p>
For this German correspondent of mine, you will have noted, "nature" signifies animal nature, Darwinian nature, red in tooth and claw. Therefore he despises appeals to natural law, and believes that not only all positive or traditional law, but all ethical principles, are human creations merely. And these human contrivances, he implies, sometimes may be mistaken; we might be wiser to found our human institutions on the principle of competition, favoring the fitter.
<p>
Here, I suggest, we perceive the mentality that lies back of the jurisprudence of Hans Kelsen and certain other positivists: critics of the whole concept of natural law.
<p>
Yet in one matter my correspondent does turn to the extreme medicine of natural law: his commendation of tyrannicide. This is interesting, as it is related to Germany in this century.
<p>
German jurisprudence demands that the citizen be strictly obedient to the state, for the state is the source of all law? the omniscient keeper of the peace. No law but positive law has been recognized in Germany since the fall of the German monarchy; natural law has no place at all.
<p>
Adolph Hitler, chosen Reichschancellor by lawful means, and confirmed in power by the Reichstag in 1933, was sustained later by national plebiscites. He was the head of the German state, the source of all law, to which all Germans had been taught obedience. Yet certain Germans-army officers, scholars, professional people, chiefly-found his actions evil. By quasi-constitutional means he had subverted the constitution. His popularity had become tremendous, and his military power. Only by death might he be removed.
<p>
Therefore a little knot of brave and conscientious men determined to save Germany and Europe by killing Hitler. They had been reared in the doctrine that all citizens must obey the inerrant state. In this exigency, however, they turned to doctrines of natural law for justification. Was there no remedy against an unnatural master of the state? In the teachings of natural law they discerned a fatal remedy. Fatal to them, at least; for nearly all of the heroic men involved in the several conspiracies against Hitler died frightful deaths. I knew well Dr. Ludwig Freund, a kindly professor of political science, one of the two survivors of the first plot to kill Hitler. By nature Professor Freund was a law-abiding gentleman. And being law-abiding, in defense of true law he was prepared to slay the chief of state, perverter of Germany's laws and the laws of man's nature.
<p>
I repeat that we have recourse to natural law, as opposed to positive law, only as a last resort, ordinarily. My only service as a jurist occurred in Morton Township, Mecosta County, some decades ago, when for two consecutive terms I was elected-unanimously-justice of the peace. When determining a disputed boundary between two farms, a justice of the peace does not repair to theories of natural law and meditate upon which of two claimants is the more worthy of judicial compassion; rather, the justice of the peace turns to statute, common law, possibly to local custom- and to the files of the recorder of deeds at the county seat. And so it is with the ordinary administration of law at every level. Statute, charter, and prescription ordinarily are sufficient to maintain the rule of law-the end of which, we ought not to forget, is to keep the peace.
<p>
Yet to guide the sovereign; the chief of state; the legislator; the public prosecutor; the judge when, in effect, he sits in equity-to guide you and me, indeed-there endures the natural law, which in essence is man's endeavor to maintain a moral order through the operation of a mundane system of justice. Unlike my German correspondent, the sustainer of natural law knows that there is law for man, and law for thing; and that our moral order is not the creation of coffee-house philosophers. Human nature ; not vulpine nature, leonine nature, or serpentine nature. Natural law is bound up with the concept of the dignity of man, and with the experience of humankind ever since the beginnings of social community.
<p>
It will not do to substitute private interpretations of natural law for common law or civil law, any more than it would have been well for England, during the Reformation, to have obeyed the "Geneva Men" by sweeping away common law and the whole inherited apparatus of parliamentary statutes, to substitute the laws of the ancient Jews. Positive law and customary law, in any country, grow out of a people's experience in community; natural law should have its high part in shaping and restraining positive and customary laws, but natural law could not conceivably supplant judicial institutions. Yet were natural-law concepts to be abandoned altogether-why, then, indeed, the world would find itself governed by 
<P><blockquote>
The good old rule, the good old plan, <BR>That they shall take who have the power, <BR>And they shall keep who can.
</blockquote><P>
Turn we now to relationships between the natural law and the American judiciary. Not since Associate Justice Joseph Story adorned the Supreme Court of the United States, early in the nineteenth century, has any member of the Supreme Court had much to say about natural law. Nevertheless, in recent decades a number of Supreme Court decisions seem to have been founded upon natural-law notions of a sort. I think, for instance, of the Warren Court's decision (the opinion written by Chief Justice Warren himself) that congressional districts within the several states must be so drawn in their boundaries as to contain so nearly as possible the same number of persons within the several districts-a matter previously left to the discretion of state legislatures. In part, this intervention was founded upon Jeremy Bentham's principle of one man, one vote; but also there seems to have lurked at the back of the minds of justices the notion that exact political equality, as told by numbers, somehow is "natural," whatever state and federal constitutions might prescribe and whatever the opinions of the Framers may have been. One might cite, too, the Court's decisions in the school desegregation cases. This question having been raised, let us examine how far we should appeal to natural law against statute and Constitution. Here we turn to an historical example and to the judgment of a leading American political and religious writer who endeavored to reconcile the claims of authority and the claims of freedom.
<p>
I refer to the "higher law" controversy of 1850 and to Orestes Brownson, the Catholic scholar and polemicist. In March 1850, on the floor of the United States Senate, William Henry Seward made his famous declaration that there exists "a higher law than the Constitution." He was referring to the Fugitive Slave Law and the Supreme Court. At once a hot controversy arose. In January 1851, Brownson published his review-essay entitled "The Higher Law," in which he refuted the claim of Seward, the Abolitionists, and the Free-Soilers to transcend the Constitution by appealing to a moral "higher law" during debate on the Fugitive Slave Bill.
<p>
Brownson agreed with Seward that 
<p><blockquote>
there is a higher law than the Constitution. The law of God is supreme, and overrides all human enactments, and every human enactment incompatible with it is null and void from the beginning, and cannot be obeyed with a good conscience, for "we must obey God rather than men." This is the great truth statesmen and lawyers are extremely prone to overlook, which the temporal authority not seldom practically denies, and on which the Church never fails to insist....
<P>
But the concession of the fact of a higher law than the Constitution does not of itself justify the appeal to it against the Constitution, either by Mr. Seward or the opponents of the Fugitive Slave Law. Mr. Seward had no right, while holding his seat in the Senate under the Constitution, to appeal to the higher law against the Constitution, because that was to deny the very authority by which he held his seat.... After having taken his oath to support the Constitution, the Senator had, so far as he was concerned, settled the question, and it was no longer for him an open question. In calling God to witness his determination to support the Constitution, he had called God to witness his conviction of the compatibility. If the Constitution with the law of God, and therefore left himself no plea for appealing from it to a higher law.
</blockquote><p>
We cannot be bound, Brownson continued, to obey a law that is in contravention of the law of God.
<p><blockquote>
This is the grand principle held by the old martyrs, and therefore they chose martyrdom rather than obedience to the state commanding them to act contrary to the Divine law. But who is to decide whether a special civil enactment be or be not repugnant to the law of God? Here is a grave and perplexing question for those who have no divinely authorized interpreter of the divine law.
</blockquote><p>
The Abolitionists and Free-Soilers, Brownson remarked, had adopted the Protestant principle of private judgment.
<p><blockquote>
But this places the individual above the state, and is wholly incompatible with the simplest conception of civil government. No civil government can exist, none is conceivable even, when every individual is free to disobey its orders whenever they do not happen to square with his private convictions of what is the law of God.
</blockquote><p>
The Church, Brownson writes, is the authoritative interpreter of the divine law. He reminds his readers that the state is ordained of God; but the state is not the supreme and infallible organ of God's will on earth.
<p><blockquote>
Now it is clear that Mr. Seward and his friends, the Abolitionists and the Free Soilers, have nothing to which they can appeal from the action of government but their private interpretation of the law of God, that is to say, their own private judgment or opinion as individuals; for it is notorious that they are good Protestants, holding the pretended right of private judgment, and rejecting all authoritative interpretation of the Divine law. To appeal from government to private judgment is to place private judgment above public authority, the individual above the state, which, as we have seen, is incompatible with the very existence of government, and therefore, since government is a divine ordinance, absolutely forbidden by the law of God-that very higher law invoked to justify resistance to civil enactments.... No man can ever be justifiable in resisting the civil law under the pretense that it is repugnant to the Divine law, when he has only his private judgment, or, what is the same thing, his private interpretation of the Sacred Scriptures, to tell him what the Divine law is on the point in question, because the principle on which he would act in doing so would be repugnant to the very existence of government, and therefore in contravention of the ordinance, therefore of the law, of God.
</blockquote><p>
Brownson's argument-which we have not time enough to analyze in full today-in substance is this, in his own words: "Mr. Seward and his friends asserted a great and glorious principle, but misapplied it." It was not for them to utter commands in the name of God. Their claims, if carried far enough, would lead to anarchy. The arguments of some of their adversaries would lead to Statolatry, the worship of the state.
<p><blockquote>
The cry for liberty abolishes all loyalty, and destroys the principle and the spirit of obedience, while the usurpations of the state leave to conscience no freedom, to religion no independence. The state tramples on the spiritual prerogatives of the Church, assumes to itself the functions of schoolmaster and director of consciences, and the multitude clap their hands, and call it liberty and progress!
</blockquote><p>
Brownson advocated compliance with the Fugitive Slave Law, which clearly was constitutional; indeed, obligatory under Article IV, Section 2 of the Constitution It was his hope to avert the Civil War which burst out ten years later. "Now there is a right and a wrong way of defending the truth, and it is always easier to defend the truth on sound than on unsound principles," he wrote. "If men were less blind and headstrong, they would see that the higher law can be asserted without any attack upon legitimate civil authority, and legitimate civil authority and the majesty of the law can be vindicated without asserting the absolute supremacy of the civil power, and falling into statolatry- as absurd a species of idolatry as the worship of sticks and stones."
<p>
Very possibly, ladies and gentlemen, you have found in these passages from "The Higher Law" and in Brownson's general argument various considerations highly relevant to our own era.
<p>
As Brownson remarks, the natural law (or law of God) and the American civil law are not ordinarily at swords' points. Large elements of natural law entered into the common law of England- and therefore into the common law of the United States-over the centuries; and the Roman law, so eminent in the science of jurisprudence, expresses the natural law enunciated by the Roman jurisconsults. No civilization ever has attempted to maintain the bed of justice by direct application of natural-law doctrines by magistrates; necessarily, it is by edict, rescript, and statute that any state keeps the peace through a system of courts. It simply will not do to maintain that private interpretation of natural law should be the means by which conflicting claims are settled.
<p>
Rather, natural law ought to help form the judgments of the persons who are lawmakers- whether emperors, kings, ecclesiastics, aristocratic republicans, or representatives of a democracy. The civil law should be shaped in conformity to the natural law-which originated, in Cicero's words, "before any written law existed or any state had been established."
<p>
It does not follow that judges should be permitted to push aside the Constitution, or statutory laws, in order to substitute their private interpretations of what the law of nature declares. To give the judiciary such power would be to establish what might be called an archonocracy, a domination of judges, supplanting the constitutional republic; also it surely would produce some curious and unsettling decisions, sweeping away precedent, which would be found highly distressing by friends to classical and Christian natural law. Only the Catholic Church, Brownson reasoned, has authority to interpret the laws of nature; but the Supreme Court of the United States, and the inferior federal courts, and our state courts, take no cognizance of papal encyclicals. Left to their several private judgments of what is "natural," some judges indubitably would do mischief to the person and the republic. The Supreme Court's majority decision in the case of Roe v. Wade-in which a pretended "right of privacy," previously unknown, was discovered-in actuality amounted to a declaration of the "natural right" of a mother to destroy her offspring.
<p>
Now it seems to me curiously naive to fancy that American courts always would subscribe to Thomistic concepts of the laws of nature, and abjure Jacobin doctrines of natural right. Courts of law must ordinarily accord with the general legislative authority; otherwise the Book of Judges is followed by the Book of Kings.
<p>
In the seventh edition of <i>The Conservative Mind,</i> I have written that the first canon of conservative thought is "Belief in a transcendent order, or body of natural law. Political problems, at bottom, are religious and moral problems. A narrow rationality, which Coleridge called the Understanding, cannot of itself satisfy human needs.... True politics is the art of apprehending and applying the Justice which ought to prevail in a community of souls."
<p>
Now Mr. Robert Bork, whose opinion as to the application of natural-law doctrines by members of the Supreme Court I have just now endorsed with some vigor, has taken notice of this. In an essay entitled "Natural Law and the Constitution," Mr. Bork advises my friend Mr. William Bentley Ball to abjure my exhortation of this sort. "The dictum also is inaccurate," Bork adds, "for it arbitrarily disqualifies as conservatives people who accept and struggle to preserve every conservative value but who do not believe that such values derive from a transcendent order." One might as well say, I suggest, that the Church ought not to emphasize the dogma of the Resurrection because that might alienate some people who are not Christians, but are possible well-wishers.
<p>
I have thought highly of Mr. Bork-although he seems to have no clear understanding of natural law and its function-but he appears to have thought lowly of me. Perhaps we both have been mistaken.
<p>
That federal judges, Mr. Bork included, have not been learned in the natural law is one of the educational misfortunes of our age. When the time is out of joint, we can repair to the teachings of Cicero and Aquinas and Hooker about the law of nature, in the hope that we may diminish man's inhumanity unto man. The natural law lacking, we may become so many Cains, and every man' s hand may be raised against every other man's.

<P>
All present in this room today are aware that the word "federal" does not mean "central." But the Congress of the United States, in recent decades, and frequently the Executive force, too, have been behaving as if unable to discern any distinction between the two terms. That way lies the collapse of the Constitution.
<p>
A simple instance of this occurred on Capitol Hill only nine days ago. We now have a new statute that prohibits servants of the federal government-and they are legion-from lodging in hotels (lodging at public expense, anyway) that do not have sprinklers in the ceilings of bedrooms. A few exemptions are granted, chiefly to hotels that stand less than four stories high. The act's premise is that by excluding non-complying hotels from federal patronage, virtually all innkeepers will find it necessary to install sprinklers (cost about $1,500 per room).The justification for this thoughtful legislation is that over the past six years, more than 400 persons have died in hotel fires in the United States. (Even I can master short division: this statistic, in effect, tells us that the hotel-fire death rate per annum per state has been 1.34 persons. I do not have to add statistics as to age and gender; at any rate, about one and one-third people, averaging the country over, have died in the average state in the average year, 1983-1989.) It is welt of course, to save lives; but a great many more lives might be saved by prohibiting the sale of skis through an act of Congress, or by a federal statute requiring all holders of real property to sprinkle salt on their sidewalks, whether part of the public way or private, after every snowfall.
<p>
My present point, however, is not the prudence or the expense of the act now on the statute books, but rather the political consequences of decreeing that the federal government shall prescribe and regulate all sorts of concerns previously left to the police powers of the several states and local agencies of government, or left to the sensible management of individuals, households, and firms. The Sprinkler Act is a sufficient instance of the continuing conversion of this country from a federal union for specified purposes to a centralized plebiscitary democracy, in which little discretion of choice is left to states and local communities, let alone private citizens.
<p>
<b>"Democratic Despotism."</b> Behold, Behemoth! While Americans are congratulating themselves and Europeans upon the collapse of socialist states beyond the demolished Iron Curtain, there continues to expand here in North America the empire of what Alexis deTocqueville called "democratic despotism." This is a grim tendency toward total centralization of which conservatives have long complained, in somewhat vague terms, but to which they have offered, so far, little effective resistance. Permit me to quote to you a very percipient passage in de Tocqueville's <I>Democracy in America:</I>
<p><blockquote>
I think then, that the species of oppression by which democratic nations are menaced is unlike anything that ever before existed in the world; our contemporaries will find no prototype of it in their memories. I seek in vain for an expression that will accurately convey the whole of the idea I have formed of it; the old words despotism and tyranny are inappropriate; the thing itself is new, and since I cannot name it, I must attempt to define it.
<P>
I seek to trace the novel features under which despotism may appear in the world. The first thing that strikes the observation is an innumerable multitude of men, all equal and all alike incessantly endeavoring to procure the petty and paltry pleasures with which they glut their lives. Each of them, living apart, is as a stranger to the fate of all the rest; his children and his private friends constitute to him the whole of mankind. As for the rest of his fellow citizens, he is close to them, but he does not see them; he touches them, but he does not feel them; he exists only in himself and for himself alone; and if his kindred still remain to him, he may be said at any rate to have lost his country.
<P>
Above this race of men stands an immense and tutelary power, which takes upon itself alone to secure their gratification and watch over their fate. That power is absolute, minute, regular, provident, and mild. It would be like the authority of a parent if, like that authority, its object was to prepare men for manhood; but it seeks, on the contrary, to keep them in perpetual childhood; it is well content that the people should rejoice, provided that they think of nothing but rejoicing. For their happiness such a government willingly labors, but it chooses to be the sole agent and only arbiter of their necessities, facilitates their pleasures, manages their principal concerns, directs their industry, regulates the descent of property, and subdivides their inheritances; what remains, but to spare them all the care of thinking and all the trouble of living?
<P>
Thus it every day renders the exercise of the free agency of man less useful and less frequent; it circumscribes the will within a narrower range and gradually robs the man of all the uses of himself. The principle of equality has prepared men for these things; it has predisposed them to endure them and often to look on them as benefits.
</blockquote><p>
De Tocqueville has in mind here, obviously, a central government the intentions of which are beneficent. But suppose that some intentions are not beneficent? Or that legislation might be intended to harass or to punish a class, a faction, or some minority? Where, under centralized democratic despotism, would the dissidents hide? At the moment, however, let us confine ourselves to acts and decisions of centralized power which, on their face, seem in tended-if perhaps in error-to confer benefits upon the public. Many such examples might be cited; I confine myself to two, both of which occurred during the presidential administration of Lyndon Johnson.
<p>
<b>Accusing Arizona.</b> The first of these had to do with governmental inspection of meat. Some inspectors from the federal Department of Agriculture happened to visit Arizona, and there came into conflict with Arizona's state meat inspectors. The two sets of officials parted in wrath; the gentlemen from Washington menacing the Arizonans that they would be taught their place. Back in the seats of the mighty, these bureaucrats sent word to their departmental superiors, and thence to the President of the United States, that ill-inspected and potentially poisonous meat was being approved for public sale by Arizona's negligent meat inspectors. On learning this dread secret, President Johnson saw opportunity for making the American nation aware of his solicitude for their well being: the Great White Father. On television, he revealed the iniquities of Arizona to a frightened people, crying out emphatically, "Get rid of rotten meat! Get rid of rotten meat!"
<p>
A complaisant Congress very, very promptly passed a new act regarding the inspection of all meat, much extending the jurisdiction and the activities of that branch of the Department of Agriculture, and subjecting all state meat-inspecting bureaus to federal jurisdiction. --How thoughtful for the welfare of the American people, from sea to shining sea!
<p>
But others, not federal employees, looked into this affair, and the <I>Wall Street Journal</I> published in some detail an account of what had occurred. It was discovered, tardily, that in truth standards of meat inspection had been high, not low; that in fact Arizona did not approve rotten meat of any sort; and that all this fuss had arisen out of minor disputations between federal and state officials. This revelation embarrassed and angered President Johnson, who had assumed that the Washington inspectors were honest and not spiteful; but he could scarcely go back on television, this time to cry, "Bring back rotten meat! Bring back rotten meat!" Nor did Congress trouble itself to repeal the statute, so recently enacted, that made state meat inspection standards wholly subordinate to federal regulations. Since then, federal courts have ruled that if a state has higher standards than the federal ones, nevertheless the state must admit within its jurisdiction meats that meet merely the lower federal standard. A mad world, my masters!
<p>
<b>Efficient Lobbyists.</b> Indulge me, ladies and gentlemen, in one more instance of this arrogating of power not merely over state jurisdictions, but over the American bedroom- -nay, the very bed and bedding. A federal agency abruptly ruled that all mattresses manufactured must be of the inner spring type-whether or not customers might prefer a plain cotton mattress or separate springs and mattress. This ukase, promptly enforced, put out of business many small makers of mattresses; it profited, however, big standard manufacturers who charged high prices; it appeared that lobbyists for the big mattress-making corporations had been at work efficiently in Washington. As for the American citizen who might prefer a simpler mattress and a cheaper, or for persons like your servant this lecturer, who possesses several ancestral antique beds that no inner spring mattress will fit-why, says Uncle Sam to such reactionaries, "Be comfortable, damn you, and expect to pay for it!"
<p>
I have not been able to ascertain under what fantastic interpretation of existing statutes the federal agency in question was able to prescribe the sort of mattress Americans must sleep upon. How could this possibly lie within the prescriptive jurisdiction of the general government-or, for that matter, within the police powers of the several states? Yet done the thing was. A related arbitrary regulation employed the pretext of securing the health of children-though of course that protection, too, ordinarily has been exercised by state and local authorities, or by voluntary organizations.
<p>
This latter instance of federal <i>pleonexia</i> had to do with children's nightwear. From on high in Washington it was decreed that all pajamas, nightgowns, and the like must be manufactured of fire-retardant fabrics, if children were to wear them and shops were so to display them. This measure was supposed to prevent infants from being burned alive in bed; much mention was made of the number of persons annually slain or scarred as a result of smoking in bed, though L at least, had been unaware that small children were given to smoking in bed. Enforced for a time, this paternal legislation caused severe loss to makers and retailers of children's standard nightwear who had large stocks in hand; also it conferred large commercial advantages upon those progressive manufacturers who already, doubtless through foresight and humane concern, were producing large qualities of fire retardant nightwear for tots.
<p>
But alas and lackaday! Scientific studies, within a few months, coincidentally revealed that fire-retardant nightwear indubitably has caused skin cancer, respiratory troubles, and other physical afflictions. The federal regulations in question were quietly rescinded, I believe; and I fancy that it is now permitted for us to clothe our infants with mere unadulterated cotton or wool.
<p>
<b>Grave Ills.</b> I have chosen these relatively harmless and mildly amusing instances of the excessive zeal of the Washington bureaucracy to centralize practically everything, ladies and gentlemen, lest I be taken for a dreadful scaremonger. Now and again some well-intentioned elderly lady assures me, benignly, "Uncle Sam knows what's best for us." I decidedly am not of that opinion Thorough political and economical centralization works ills much graver than the quality of meats, the distribution of bedsprings, and the fabric of nighties. For my part, I am of the opinion that deTocqueville, rather than Uncle Sam, knows what's best for us. Let me add that both John Adams, Federalist, and Thomas Jefferson, Democratic Republican, would have been astounded and indignant at the degree of centralization already well established among us, two centuries after the Constitution of the United States commenced to function. I fancy that neither one would have insisted upon a sprinkler being installed in his bedchamber, at the expense of a perversion of the Constitution.
<p>
The pretexts for giving a veneer of seeming Constitutionality to the concentration of power at Washington have been various. Our recent act to install sprinklers in hotel bedrooms is one of the less extravagant apologies-that is, it amounts merely to a refusal to pay the bills of federal employees who lodge at inns that have no sprinklers in bedrooms. (Of course every hotel in this country must be thoroughly inspected to ascertain the number of sprinklers.) Another and somewhat more severe form of compulsion is the refusal to pay any monies from the federal treasury to non-complying persons and institutions, as in the case of colleges and universities coerced into Affirmative Action programs and the like. Yet another method is the withdrawal of tax exemptions from institutions otherwise entitled to such exemptions, as in the case of Bob Jones University. The oldest method is the appeal of some federal department or federal agency to the commerce clause of the Constitution as the ground for justifying some surprising enlargement of the federal government's power; and of course that is the road taken by the Congress ever since the 182Os. The most common method employed to induce states and cities, and various voluntary associations, to submit to federal regulation is the matching grant-in-aid, often on a very large scale. And in a number of instances the Congress and Executive Branch have not troubled themselves to look for excuses in the Constitution: they simply have pushed through a piece of legislation, of national scope, without bothering to enquire whether by any stretch of the imagination such an act could be regarded as authorized by some provision of the Constitution.
<p>
<b>Consolidation By Degrees.</b> In consequence of all of this, the federal character of the United States, this country's chief contribution to the art of governance, has been fading to a shadow of a shade. And where Congress hesitated, the Supreme Court rushed in to nationalize the whole political structure. More mischief of this sort was accomplished during the reign of King Lyndon than during any other period of American history-considerably more, incidentally, than was accomplished during the reign of King Franklin-but in general the leaders of either major political party have made no strong effort to resist consolidation of power; and, after all, it has come about by degrees, not as a result of any announced design. No doubt a well-publicized plan for systematic centralization would have been hotly rejected by the American electorate; and among those opponents of deliberate centralization would have been a good many liberals.
<p>
A decay of historical consciousness among Americans has had its part in reducing resistance to the concentration of decision-making powers in the general government. Here I offer you two paragraphs written by C. Northcote Parkinson, the deviser of Parkinson's Law. Professor Parkinson declares that political centralization is the initial cause of the nation's decadence. She first stage on the downward path is one of over-centralization," Parkinson wrote in 1978.
<p><blockquote>
Everything is done to eliminate or neutralize all but the main and central seat of administration The lesser centers of power are either provincial governments or organizations which can be classified as religious, financial, military, or economic: an arch-bishopric, a national bank, a military command or a major industrial or trading group. The attempt to centralize all power in the one capital city and, indeed, in its administrative quarter, means the assimilation of all possible rival institutions from monasteries to television stations, from harbour authorities to charitable foundations. All these can be eliminated in the name of democracy or efficiency, and the result is the creation of the one government machine into which all problems are fed and from which all wisdom is to emerge. All that is initially lost is the likelihood of the government's having to listen to informed criticism from outside its inner circle of officials. Thereafter the problems centre upon the growing size and complexity of the central administration. As the civil servants multiply there is an ever-increasing distance between the citizen and the nameless people who will ultimately decide upon his application, protest, or appeal. Proceedings are cumbrous and attitudes are hierarchical, all decisions being referred from the periphery to the centre and then from the bottom to the top.
<P>
"If death come from Madrid," said sixteenth-century Spaniards, "we should all live to a very great age."
<P>
Much the same comment must have been made about Babylon, Peking, Persepolis, Delhi, and London. Less frequently noticed are two other results of over-centralisation. The first is that the normal processes of retirement and promotion will bring to the centre the people who have been robbed of all initiative while posted at the circumference. The second is that the capital city is now appallingly vulnerable to internal sedition or external assault. When all roads lead to Rome, all cables to London, the usual channels to Paris, the whole administrative machinery can be knocked out by a single rocket attack there are no centres of authority outside the target area, no alternative capital city to which a government might move. With the capital city gone, there is nothing left.
</blockquote><p>
Parkinson goes on to describe the second stage in the decline and fall of great states: the growth of taxation. But that is just another vast subject on which, conceivably, I may address you another time, ladies and gentlemen. Let me proceed, just now to my peroration. The worst thing about excessive concentration of power, I believe, is that in the long run such Behemoth centralization fails; and then the whole social structure falls apart, as is occurring in the Soviet empire at this moment.
<p>
Reasons exist why a supplanting of the old constitutional order, if completed, would present most serious dangers to American order and justice and freedom. I will mention only four of these perils.
<p>
<b>Too Much Work.</b> The first is the problem of efficiency. The general government is designed to carry out certain responsibilities, fairly well defined: most notably, the conduct of foreign relations, the defense of the country, and the management of undertakings too widespread for any one state in the Union to manage. But already the government here in Washington is dismayingly oppressed by too much work and too many servants. By endeavoring to do everything, the Washington government might end in doing nothing successfully.
<p>
The second problem is of scale. Measures which the provincial governors at Graz or Innsbruck would refuse to entrust to Vienna are proposed in America as if the governing of two hundred and fifty million people were little more difficult than the conduct of a town meeting-and quite as democratic-as long as President and Congress are still elected. I have heard American advocates of social-welfare measures, for instance, seriously advance the example of social-democratic legislation in Denmark as a precedent for American policy -though some American counties, not to mention states, are larger than Denmark, and other counties have more people than there are Danes.
<p>
Appeals against imprudent or unjust administration become immensely difficult when they are only the faint voices of individuals or local groups opposed to the prestige and influence of administrators at the capital; indeed, the chief administrators themselves cannot possibly look deeply into such complaints. Detailed administration on such a scale would require from civil servants a wisdom and a goodness never experienced in human history. "Well, appeal to your Congressman," centralizers say, perhaps ingenuously. But Congressmen already do not have time enough to answer the mail from their more important constituents, let alone act as so many Don Quixotes of the mass state.
<p>
<b>Habit of Command.</b> The third difficulty I raise here is the problem of leadership. Centralized political power functions smoothly only in nations accustomed to defer to the measures and opinions of a governing class-that is, in aristocratic or autocratic lands. Soviet centralization would have failed altogether, and almost at once, had it not been for the long-established powers of the Old Regime at Moscow and St. Petersburg. And such a body of decision makers, of governors, of aristocrats, must possess a high degree of self-confidence and the habit of command. They must be accustomed to dealing with deferential populations.
<p>
But these United States, accustomed to territorial democracy, have no class of leaders and administrators competent to undertake the consolidated direction which the centralizers propose. I do not discern a class of men here competent to rule wisely this immense nation, once territorial democracy and the federal framework-both principal schools of national leadership-should be undone.
<p>
Fourth, even had we a class of Winchester old-school-tie administrators, I do not know how we could expect the most expert of statists to direct paternally and justly the concerns of this nation, once local volition and private self-reliance had been seriously weakened. A man has but twenty-four hours in his day, and can read only a limited number of papers. Such centralization defeats its own object, in persons as in departments. The man-killing job of the presidency-to which centralizers will add numerous fresh responsibilities-may be sufficient illustration of my meaning.
<p>
<b>Unmanageable People.</b> To destroy, or let atrophy, territorial democracy and the federal system in America is quite possible; but it is less easy to provide some alternative satisfactory scheme of politics. Once the principle of volition, with the sense of participation and local decision, vanishes from American life, Americans are liable to become an unmanageable people. On a grander and more catastrophic scale, we might see again the resistance to authority and resort to violence which were provoked by the Eighteenth Amendment and the Volstead Act. Both the Eighteenth Amendment and the Volstead Act were "democratically" adopted; but somehow national positive democracy is not the same thing as territorial prescriptive democracy. Indeed, already we see great American cities in anarchy from time to time-the anarchists those people, black or white, who feel they have been excluded from full participation in society. What would occur when the majority should fell excluded from decision making?
<p>
Within a few years, if not immediately, any "guided democracy" or "plebiscitary democracy" would meet with evasion and hostility everywhere, and among the results of this could come a diminishing of the really effectual and popular authority of the general government. The energies and loyalties of volition would have been supplanted by the compulsions of a latter-day Jacobism, or of the Directory. And a great big Federal Bureau of Investigation would not be able to enforce the decrees of such a regime; for though a new broom sweeps clean, and an elite federal detective force aiding the local police is one thing, a permanent national secret police would be quite another-and possibly disagreeable to some of the "liberal" advocates of centralization. For that matter, a garrison of federal troops in every city might not suffice to keep order.
<p>
Yet life still rises in the tree of American federalism, and territorial democracy's powers of resistance and reaction ought not to be disregarded. It is true, as deTocqueville remarked, that men in power generally feel impelled to augment central power, while the opponents of centralization are either stupid or powerless. Notwithstanding this, attachment to the doctrines of division of authority and of state and local powers remains so popular in the United States that an intelligent plan for preserving the old system would obtain a hearing, and stand some chance of enactment.
<p>
<b>Buttressing the Structure.</b> An enormous, unitary omnicompetent nation-state cannot abide the American political tradition of cake and custom. If the federal system is obsolete, then we ought to prepare to train the leaders of a new order, and to define the character of that domination, novel to us. If territorial democracy deserves to live, if the federal system has virtue still, then the constitutional structure ought to be buttressed and helped to function. At present, most of the Americans qualified to think about such matters decline to take either of these courses. They are willing to let the norms of politics shift for themselves -which is not according to nature.
<p>
Such is another huge prospect for conservatives. Let us hope that the rising generation of conservatives may have the courage and the imagination required to avert the triumph of the centralizers; for that triumph would be followed swiftly enough by the decay of the American Republic.
